A paved extension of the trail extends north for approximately into the City of Tallahassee. Recreational activities Activities include bicycling, skating, walking, jogging, and horseback riding. Amenities include a paved surface for those on foot or wheels and an unpaved trail for those on horseback. Parking is available at the trail head on SR 363/Woodville Hwy., just south of Tallahassee, as well as at the J. Lewis Hall Park in Woodville, the Wakulla Station Trailhead in Wakulla County, and the city park at the end of the trail in St. Marks. Parks and recreational areas adjacent to the trail include the Munson Hills Off-Road Bicycle Trail system, which is accessible from the Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail parking area via the Paper Cup Trail spur, as well as from the Trail Access spur south of the main trail head off SR 363. J. Lewis Hall Park in Woodville, accessible south of the main trail head off SR 363; the Wakulla Station Trailhead, accessible south of the main trail head (and north of St. Marks) off SR 363; and the San Marcos de Apalache Historic State Park, located at the end of the trail in St. Marks. The Munson Hills Trails are popular with off-road bicyclists and have recently been expanded to in length between two main (Munson Hills and Twilight) trails. J. Lewis Hall Park hosts numerous youth baseball games, among other events. An \\"adaptable playground\\" designed for special needs children has recently been installed at the Wakulla Station Trailhead. Starting in late 2009, according to Florida Greenways and Trails, the trail was completely resurfaced and widened to 12' in width. The portion of the trail south of the Wakulla Trailhead was reconstructed first, while the portion north of the Wakulla Trailhead was reconstructed after work was completed on the southern end of the trail. In conjunction with the trail construction, a new trailhead was built in the city of St. Marks near the current trail terminus. Construction was completed in early 2011. Special events The annual Tallahassee Marathon utilizes all of the City of Tallahassee portion and the northern six miles (10 km) of the State of Florida portion of the St. Marks Trail. Hours Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).

Plot Robert Leaf (James Stewart) is an American college professor, who won a Pulitzer for poetry and prizes the arts. Both Robert and Vina (Glynis Johns) are dedicated to the arts and prompt their children, Pandora, \\"Penny,\\" and Erasmus, to develop artistic skills. The Leaf family lives on a houseboat in San Francisco. The Captain (Ed Wynn) sold the Leafs the boat and lives with them; he provides narration. Professor Leaf, in particular, is dismayed to discover that eight-year-old Erasmus (Bill Mumy) is tone-deaf and colorblind, as he can't share the family's artistic pursuits. Moreover, Erasmus is a mathematical prodigy. The Professor is wary, wanting him to understand that this is only one part of his life. Erasmus agrees, but unwittingly calls media attention to himself by correcting figures at a bank. After, his parents become very determined that he have a normal child's life. They decide to have him talk to a psychiatrist, too. Erasmus tells the psychiatrist that math is okay, but he really loves model and actress Brigitte Bardot and writes her love letters. 18-year-old Penny Cindy Carol and her friends pay Erasmus to do their math homework (he uses the money for airmail stamps to send his letters to Brigitte). The Leafs take Erasmus for testing at the university; he agrees to be tested if they'll pay him. He answers questions correctly before the computer can calculate, and the officials push for more tests. The Leafs refuse, wanting him to have a normal childhood; besides, Erasmus wants to leave. Called to the Dean's office, a sheriff informs the Professor that Erasmus has been using his skills to calculate bets for an undercover campus betting ring run by Ken Taylor (Fabian), Penny's boyfriend, who was paying him to pick winners. Accused of complicity, the Professor quits his job and storms home. He and Vina question Ken and Penny. When paid, Erasmus shows his parents that he calculates winners by reading daily racetrack newspaper entries; Penny reveals that he spends his earnings on stamps. Troubled, his parents discuss if Erasmus deciding odds for people is immoral/ethical or not, concluding it's wrong. The Professor applies for unemployment and is told that he must wait two weeks for a check. Erasmus gives him the money that he's saved up from doing math problems, so that Penny can have a new Prom dress. While buying it for her, they meet Dr. Peregrine Upjohn (John Williams), who admires the Professor. That evening, the Professor's delighted to learn from Erasmus' psychiatrist that his son loves Brigitte Bardot, as Erasmus has been unhappy with the attention paid to his math skills and this is such a regular interest. Upjohn proposes they found the Leaf Foundation to fund liberal arts scholarships. The Professor and Vina love this idea. During their talk, students march to the houseboat, demanding that the Professor return to work; he accepts and announces the Foundation. Conferring, the Leafs decide that it isn't unethical to ask Erasmus if they can use his talent to fundraise for such a good cause. Brigitte invites Erasmus to visit her in France. Upjohn suggests that Erasmus go, as it'll promote the Foundation. The Professor accompanies him, Upjohn assisting the Leafs with their flight costs. At Brigitte's house, Erasmus stares at her adoringly, barely speaking, and asks for her autograph. The Professor takes a picture of them together, despite Erasmus looking at Brigitte, not at the camera. She gives him a puppy from her pet poodle and thinks he's adorable. Upon returning, Erasmus calculates different bets to fundraise. While falling asleep one night, he says, \\"Fromage,\\" leading the adults to think he's picking longest of long-shots, \\"French Cheese\\" in the sixth race. At the track the next day, he denies picking her, to everyone's horror. French Cheese wins her race, and the family's ecstatic. The Professor then realizes that Upjohn, who held the tickets, has left the stands. Upjohn, who's actually a con artist and plans to abscond with the funds, is collecting the winnings. The Professor finds him and grabs the bag of money, declaring that it's for the Foundation. The Dean affirms this statement. The press overhears and asks for a photo-op of the Professor, the Dean, and the Foundation's new endowment.

There was some talk that Disney would option the film rights and cast Bing Crosby in the lead role. However rights were bought by 20th Century Fox who assigned the project to Nunnally Johnson, Henry Koster and James Stewart, the team that made Mr Hobbs Takes a Vacation and Take Her, She's Mine. Johnson later said he \\"hadn't wanted to do\\" the film. \\"I didn't think there was enough material in it, but I really allowed myself to be persuaded to do it. Jimmie would sign if I would write it, and Koster would get a job if Jimmie would sign. It all got around that, one depending on another. There was no material in there that justified a picture.\\"Johnson p 135 Although Nunnally Johnson wrote early drafts of the film, Hal Kanter was brought in to work on it and he gets sole screen credit. Kanter says it was Henry Koster's idea to introduce a captain, played by Ed Wynn, to act as a Greek chorus. Johnson said Koster got this idea from the film Tom Jones. Johnson did not like the device because he felt it did not suit the picture and told Koster to get another writer to do it. He told Koster \\"You'd better get a good gag man who does those one-line things. I don't do that, and I couldn't do it.\\"Johnson p 135 Koster hired Kanter and Johnson asked to take his name off the film. Johnson says when he saw Stewart \\"he told me he didn't know I'd taken my name off of it. He was unhappy about the picture too, but there was nothing to do by then.\\"Johnson p 135 It was one of the first movies made at the recently re-opened 20th Century Fox studios. Billy Mumy was cast on the recommendation of James Stewart's wife, Gloria Stewart, who taught a Sunday School class that Mumy attended. Johnson later said, \\"Henry was an old-fashioned fellow, and If it hadn't have been for the fact that Jimmie Stewart was the leading man in the pictures, he would have expired much earlier than he did. I'm afraid he's through now, you know. But I've seen him, and there's nothing sadder than these old directors who disappear and don't get jobs. In the old days, a fellow wrote a script, they hired a director. Now, quite often, unless they can get somebody like Willie Wyler or Billy Wilder or somebody like that, the writer directs it. This all goes to prove, to me anyway, that the old-time directors, were a real collection of frauds.\\"Johnson p 173 The film was the sixth straight acting role for Fabian since he quit singing. He had previously appeared in Mr Hobbs Takes a Vacation. He had never been to the races before being cast so researched his role by going to the races and developing a betting system. There was some doubt Bardot would appear in the film but she relented and her scenes were shot in three days in Paris. Reception According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $4,500,000 in rentals to break even and made $2,920,000, meaning it made a loss.

During the summer of 1897 Walter Granger, a paleontologist from the American Museum of Natural History, came upon a hillside littered with Jurassic period dinosaur bone fragments. Nearby was a sheepherder's cabin built entirely out of fossil bones, hence the name \\"Bone Cabin Quarry.\\" After Granger's discovery in late August 1897, the quarry was kept secret until the summer of 1898, when the manpower could be amassed to undertake a full-scale excavation. Bone Cabin Quarry was excavated from 1898 until 1905, when the productivity of specimens thinned. Some of the dinosaurs found at the Bone Cabin Quarry include Stegosaurus, Allosaurus and Apatosaurus.

The film follows a man (Selton Mello) who returns to his father's home after many years and falls in love with his sister (Simone Spoladore). In 2015, the Brazilian Film Critics Association (Abraccine) placed To the Left of the Father among their list of 100 Greatest Brazilian Films of All Time Plot summary The story concerns a young man living at home, Andr√© (Selton Mello), whose ideas are radically different from those of his farmer father (Raul Cortez). The father advocates order and restraint, which enhance his own power under the guise of family love. The son seeks freedom and pleasure, exemplified in his passion for his sister Ana (Simone Spoladore). When Andr√© moves to a seedy boarding house, his older brother Pedro (Leonardo Medeiros), is asked by their mother (Juliana Carneiro da Cunha) to bring him back. His return, however, will shatter the family's insular life.

This involved intensive coaching of the cast, secluded on a farm for four months. The film's creation and production process was discussed in the book About To the Left of The Father (\\"Sobre Lavoura Arcaica\\"), in which the director is interviewed by Jos√© Carlos Avellar, Geraldo Sarno, Miguel Pereira, Ivana Bentes, Arnaldo Carrilho and Liliane Heynemann, launched in Portuguese, English and French by the publisher Ateli√™ Editorial. Reception It was a success with the critics and the public, reaching 300,000 viewers with just two exhibition locations, one in Rio de Janeiro and the other in S√£o Paulo. Critical response It is considered one of the 100 best Brazilian films of all time, according to the Brazilian Film Critics Association (Abraccine). In the opinion of writer and psychoanalyst Renato Tardivo, author of Porvir que vem antes de tudo ‚Äì literatura e cinema em Lavoura Arcaica, the film is one of the most important works of Brazilian cinema ‚Äúof all times‚Äù. The critic Carlos Alberto de Mattos described it as the first work of art of the Brazilian cinema in the 21st century. The film was acclaimed by the critics of various countries and, according to the French magazine Cahiers du Cin√©ma, To the Left of the Father is a \\"barbarous poem verging on hallucination, of extraordinary power\\". Accolades It had a successful career in a number of national and international festivals, receiving over 50 awards at the Montreal World Film Festival, the Rio Film Festival, the S√£o Paulo International Film Festival, the Grand Prix for Brazilian Film, the Bras√≠lia Film Festival, the Havana Film Festival, the Cartagena Film Festival, the Guadalajara International Film Festival, the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, among others.

He also gave an example of a C1 diffeomorphism with an irrational rotation number that is not conjugate to a rotation.  Statement of the theorem  Let ∆í: S1 ‚Üí S1 be an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle whose rotation number Œ∏ = œÅ(∆í) is irrational. Assume that it has positive derivative ∆í ‚Ä≤(x) > 0 that is a continuous function with bounded variation on the interval [0,1). Then ∆í is topologically conjugate to the irrational rotation by Œ∏. Moreover, every orbit is dense and every nontrivial interval I of the circle intersects its forward image ∆í¬∞q(I), for some q > 0 (this means that the non-wandering set of ∆í is the whole circle).  Complements  If ∆í is a C2 map, then the hypothesis on the derivative holds; however, for any irrational rotation number Denjoy constructed an example showing that this condition cannot be relaxed to C1, continuous differentiability of ∆í. Vladimir Arnold showed that the conjugating map need not be smooth, even for an analytic diffeomorphism of the circle. Later Michel Herman proved that nonetheless, the conjugating map of an analytic diffeomorphism is itself analytic for \\"most\\" rotation numbers, forming a set of full Lebesgue measure, namely, for those that are badly approximable by rational numbers.

This is the second title in the Bonk series and it was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. A completely different game with the same name appeared on the Game Boy, whereas the original version was re-released for Wii Virtual Console and on the Japanese PlayStation Store.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/software/03.htmlhttps://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/KG87TxjuZ4yc6InqgMa6bD3Utf3lSetY It was also released in Japan on Windows Store on December 13, 2013 and on Wii U Virtual Console on March 12, 2014.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000005607 The title is also playable on the Turbografx-16/PC Engine Mini Console. Gameplay This time, the titular large-headed caveman is on a quest to recover half of the Moon, which was stolen by the evil King Drool III. Its multiple stages each contain several specific areas, which range from outdoors to trains to space to underwater. As in most platformers, Bonk has several crucial abilities: the I button causes him to jump; the II button causes him to \\"bonk,\\" an action in which Bonk slams his head forward, inflicting a killing blow on most enemies; I jump-II combo causes Bonk to head-butt the Earth, killing enemies he lands on and creating a damaging shock wave; Holding down the II button in midair causes Bonk to spin and hover, allowing for long, controlled jumps. Bonk can also use his large mouth to grip onto allowed surfaces for climbing. Bonk's health is reflected in heart containers, similar to games in the Zelda series. Taking damage will cause Bonk to lose a certain amount of hearts, and hearts can be refilled through items, such as fruit, collected throughout the game. Bonk can also attain blue hearts that increase his amount of hearts, allowing him to effectively gain more health as the game progresses. The game also features Smileys, similar to coins in the Mario series, which are helpful when the player gets to the bonus round after each boss because they can get extra lives. Bonk can also turn invincible when he collects a large meat or two small meats, and can gain an extra life when he collects a small model of himself. Power-up forms Bonk is able to power-up and change into various forms by eating meat. With one small piece of meat, when he Bonks, a cloud floats towards enemies, freezing them when they come in contact. When he spins in the air, he has a cloud surrounding him. When he lands on his head, it freezes all enemies on-screen. With an additional small piece or one large piece, he becomes fully powered up and becomes temporarily invincible. In this form, he breathes fire, which destroys any enemies that come into contact with it. When spinning, he is surrounded by fire, & when he lands, it causes damage to all enemies, and instantly destroys most, but not all of them on-screen. Variations in gameplay In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape, provides him with Vulcan- esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives Bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger headbutt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys. Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk‚Äîin a best-of-three battle to \\"bonk\\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual. The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning. Reception Reviewing the Game Boy game, GamePro commented that the game is fun but too short and easy, offering \\"not much more than an afternoon or two of challenge.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B.

He was best known for his theory of the secondary products revolution. Education and career Sherratt was born in Oldham, Lancashire on 8 May 1946.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article738924.ece From 1965, he studied archaeology and anthropology at Peterhouse, Cambridge University, completing his degree in 1968. He received his PhD from Cambridge in 1976, writing his thesis on The Beginning of the Bronze Age in south-east Europe. By then he had already moved to Oxford, having been appointed Assistant Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum in 1973. He was a reader at the University of Oxford from 1997 and Professor from 2002. Oxford remained his academic home until 2005, when he took up a professorship at the University of Sheffield. Sherratt travelled widely and received international recognition for his work. He was invited to give the prestigious Human Context and Society lectures at Boston University in 1998 and his topic was Between Evolution and History: long-term change in human societies. Research Sherratt's most cited publication was Plough and pastoralism: aspects of the secondary products revolution', published in 1981 in 'Pattern of the Past: Studies in Honour of David Clarke' , the first article in which he described his idea of a secondary products revolution. He regularly contributed outside of his main field, for instance through a position on the editorial board of the historical journal Past and Present.Past and Present Society His ability to work at a continental, even global, scale of analysis has invited comparisons with V. Gordon Childe. Analysis at the continental scale led him into adaptation of world-systems theory to questions of change on the large scale in archaeology, notably in the first volume of the Journal of European Archaeology ( 'What would a Bronze Age world system look like? Relations between temperate Europe and the Mediterranean in later prehistory' ) and in his 1995 David Clarke Memorial Lecture, also published in JEA: 'Reviving the grand narrative: Archaeology and long-term change' . Such interests in linking across continents meant that Andrew maintained an interest in all the major shifts in humanity from global colonisation, through the spread of agriculture to the development of metallurgy and urbanism, including the Indo-European question and the development of new forms of consumption. A collection of his most significant publications in many of these areas appeared in 1997 as Economy and Society in Prehistoric Europe: changing perspectives. Sherratt's interest in broad scale patterns in history attracted perhaps his most prestigious accolades, such as when the University of Chicago's historian William McNeill conferred a portion of the prestigious Erasmus Prize he won in 1996 upon Sherratt. The Erasmus Prize, awarded annually by the Dutch Praemium Erasmianum Foundation 'for exceptionally important contributions to European culture', requires the winner to pass on his prize-money to chosen nominees. Sherratt recognised the importance of psychoactive drugs and medicine to early culture, and he was co-editor of Consuming Habits, Drugs in History and Anthropology. Sherratt was invited to present the four part television series, Sacred Weeds, which aired to critical acclaim in 1998. Sherratt was always a stimulating and inspirational teacher. He had a significant hand in designing Oxford's undergraduate course in archaeology and anthropology, playing a key role as an interlocutor in the development of a new generation of archaeologists who drew from social anthropology as well as archaeology. However, presenting his ideas at the appropriate scale has been a constant challenge, as is reflected in an early edited work, the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Archaeology, published in 1980 and subsequently translated into German, French, Italian, Dutch and Swedish. Shortly before his death of a heart attack in Witney (near Oxford), Andrew had initiated a project, ArchAtlas, that uses modern remote sensing technology, combined with image and text, to graphically communicate complex patterns of change and interaction across time and space.  Personal life  Sherratt married Susan Sherratt in 1974; they had three children and also co-authored several academic articles.

Lester was also a civil rights activist, a photographer,Julius Lester at Profotos.com. and a musician who recorded two albums of folk music and original songs. Early life and family Born on January 27, 1939, St. Louis, Missouri, Julius Lester was the son of W. D. Lester, a Methodist minister, and Julia (Smith) Lester. The family moved to Kansas City, Kansas, in 1941, and to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1952. In 1960 he received his BA from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, with a major in English and minors in Art and Spanish. In 1961 he moved to New York City where he was a folk singer and a photographer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Lester was married to Joan Steinau. They had two children, Jody Simone (1965) and Malcolm Coltrane (1967). They divorced in 1970. In 1979 he married Alida Carolyn Fechner, who had a daughter, Elena Milad. Fechner and Lester had a son together named David Julius. They divorced in 1991. He married Milan Sabatini in 1995. His stepdaughter from this marriage is Li√°n Amaris. Civil rights years During college, Lester became involved in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Among his major efforts in those years was participation in the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project. His experiences during ‚ÄúFreedom Summer‚Äù were documented in a 2014 documentary ‚ÄúThe Folk Singer,‚Äù airing as part of the American Experience series on PBS. Lester also traveled to North Vietnam with SNCC to photograph and write about the damage caused by U.S. bombing missions there. During his New York years, Lester hosted Uncle Tom's Cabin, a radio show on WBAI-FM (1968‚Äì75); and co-hosted (with Jonathan Black) Free Time, a television show on WNET-NY (Channel 13), for two years. He recorded two albums of traditional and original songs for Vanguard Records: Julius Lester (1966) and Departures (1967). And he performed on the coffeehouse circuit. A compilation of songs from both albums was released on a CD, Dressed Like Freedom, on Ace Records in 2007. Lester's 1966 essay \\"The Angry Children of Malcolm X,\\" is considered one of the definitive African-American statements of its era. As his reputation grew, Lester wrote Look Out, Whitey! Black Power‚Äôs Gon‚Äô Get Your Mama! (Dial, 1968), which he characterized as the ‚Äúfirst book about the black power movement by someone inside the black power movement‚Äù. Conversion to Judaism In 1982 Lester converted to Judaism.\\"Julius Lester: There's 'no magic formula' for blacks and Jews\\". J (jweekly.com). February 16, 1996.

He adopted the Hebrew name Yaakov Daniel ben Avraham v‚ÄôSarah. He was a leader of the Beth El Synagogue in St. Johnsbury, Vermont from 1991-2001. Academic career From 1968 to 1970, alongside his activities as a radio host in New York, Lester taught Afro-American history at the New School for Social Research. In 1971 he began teaching at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a visiting lecturer in the Afro-American Studies department; he became an associate professor in the department in 1975 and a full professor in 1977.\\"Obituary: Julius Lester, Professor Emeritus of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies\\".

In 1988, Lester came into conflict with his colleagues in the Afro-American Studies department upon the publication of his book Lovesong, which chronicles his conversion to Judaism. In the book he refers to a lecture at the university by the renowned author James Baldwin several years earlier, and characterizes certain remarks that Baldwin made as anti-Semitic.Fox, Margalit (January 19, 2018). \\"Julius Lester, Chronicler of Black America, Is Dead at 78\\".

Raises Censorship Cry\\". New York Times. nytimes.com. May 29, 1988. Retrieved 2018-01-21. Following negotiations that involved the chancellor of the university, the dean of the faculty, and Lester himself, Lester transferred to the Judaic and Near Eastern Studies department (where he had held a joint appointment since 1982), and remained there for the rest of his university career, until his retirement at the end of 2003. During his 32 years at the university, Lester taught courses in five departments: Comparative Literature (\\"Black and White Southern Fiction\\"), English (\\"Religion in Western Literature\\"), Afro-American Studies (\\"The Writings of W. E. B. Du Bois\\"), (\\"Writings of James Baldwin\\"), (\\"Literature of the Harlem Renaissance\\"), (\\"Blacks and Jews: A Comparative Study\\"), and Judaic Studies (\\"Biblical Tales and Legends\\") and (\\"The Writings of Elie Wiesel\\"), History (\\"Social Change and the 1960s\\"), one of the university's largest and most popular courses. Lester was awarded all three of the university's most prestigious faculty awards: the Distinguished Teacher's Award, the Faculty Fellowship Award for Distinguished Research and Scholarship, and the Chancellor's Medal, the university's highest honor. The Council for Advancement and Support of Education selected him as the Massachusetts State Professor of the Year 1986. Creative endeavors In addition to performing songs and recording albums, Lester wrote eight nonfiction books, 31 children's books, one book of poetry and photographs (with David Gahr), and three adult novels. His first book was an instructional guide to playing the 12-string guitar, co-authored with Pete Seeger. Among the awards his books received were the Newbery Honor, Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award, Coretta Scott King Award, National Book Award finalist, ALA Notable Book, National Jewish Book Award finalist, National Book Critics Circle Honor Book, and the New York Times Outstanding Book Award. His books have been translated into eight languages. He published more than 200 essays and book and film reviews for such publications as The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times Op-Ed page, The Boston Globe, Village Voice, The New Republic, Sing Out!, Moment, Forward and Dissent. His photographs have been included in an exhibit of images from the civil rights movement at the Smithsonian Institution. He had solo shows at the University of Massachusetts Student Union Gallery, the Forbes Library, Northampton, Mass., Valley Photo Center, Springfield, Mass., and the Robert Floyd Photography Gallery, Southampton, Mass.

Career Bracht (right) in 1941 After training as a gardener, Bracht entered military service in 1917, and was deployed at the front until the end of World War I. Thereafter, he found himself a prisoner of the British, until 1919. On 1 April 1927, Bracht joined the Nazi Party with membership number 77,890 and was appointed leader of the NSDAP district of Sauerland in October 1928. He held the same position as of 1 March 1931 in Altena. Elected to the Prussian Landtag in April 1932, he was also elected to the Reichstag in November 1933. He was appointed to the post of Deputy Gauleiter of Gau Silesia on 1 May 1935, serving under Gauleiter Josef Wagner. He also served briefly as acting Deputy Gauleiter in Wagner's other jurisdiction, Gau Westphalia-South from 1 August to 15 August 1936. When Silesia was split into two Gaue, Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia on 27 January 1941, Bracht succeeded Wagner as the Gauleiter of the new Upper Silesia. He also succeeded to the position of Oberpr√§sident (High President) of the new Province of Upper Silesia, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. On 16 November 1942 he was named Reich Defence Commissioner in his Gau. On 20 April 1944, he was promoted to the rank of SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer. Within Bracht's jurisdiction was the concentration camp Auschwitz. In 1944, with war threatening Silesia, Bracht ordered that air defence facilities in his Gau be upgraded and made stronger, however, he could not prevail upon the Armament Ministry to do so. Major offensives were launched against Upper Silesia beginning in January 1945 and hostilities continued in the area into May. As the Red Army marched into Silesia at the war's end, Bracht and his wife both committed suicide by poisoning themselves with potassium cyanide on 9 May 1945.

Sherman was born in Richmond, Vermont, the son of Hathaway and Relief Sherman. At the age of 14, he joined the Richmond Cornet Band and soon became its leader. He left this band in 1864 to join the 9th Vermont Infantry as a musician during the American Civil War. After the war he came to live in Winooski, where he married Mary A. Thompson and became a band teacher. In 1878 he organized, with much coaxing from the citizens of Burlington, Sherman's Military Band, made up of musicians from the dormant Queen City Band. This band came to be well known all over the East as one of the finest touring Military Bands. Sherman's Military Band ca 1882 After Sherman retired from the band in 1917, the group became known as the Burlington Military Band under the exceptional directorship of Dr. Joseph Lechnyr, an influential Vermont musician. George continued to live on Sherman Street (which many erroneously believe to be named after him) until November 3, 1927, the date of the great flood. On that day, while crossing the street near his home at the corner of Sherman and Battery Street (on the park side of Battery St.) at the age of 83, he was struck by a car and died two hours later of multiple lacerations and a fractured skull. His funeral was attended by Grand Army of the Republic comrades, and the Masonic Ritual was held at his graveside. He left three children at the time of his death. Although Sherman is well remembered as one of the first leaders of what is known today as the Burlington Concert Band, he is also remembered for his fine marches, some of which were used by John Philip Sousa in his concert tours. A complete list of his compositions follows. The Burlington Concert Band has only three of Sherman's pieces, as many were lost in a fire in the same year as his death.

National Lacrosse League (NLL) career Doyle was born in Kitchener, Ontario. He began his NLL career in 1998, playing for Ontario Raiders. He scored 34 goals and 27 assists, leading the Raiders in scoring. He was named NLL Rookie of the Year. In 1999, the Raiders moved to Toronto, becoming the Toronto Rock, where they won their first of 6 NLL Championships. Doyle finished first or second in Rock scoring every year from 1999 until 2005, and was named league MVP in 2005. He has been named playoff MVP an unprecedented three times -- in 1999, 2002, and 2005. On December 27, 2006, the Rock traded Doyle, Darren Halls, and a draft pick to the San Jose Stealth for Ryan Benesch, Kevin Fines, Chad Thompson, and two draft picks. Just after the 2009 season began, Doyle was named by Paul Tutka of NLLInsider.com as the top player in the league, stating that Doyle \\"has become today's most stellar offensive leader, creating a relationship with Jeff Zywicki that is turning out to be one of the most lethal in the NLL.\\" Tutka also praised Doyle's commitment to his teammates: Doyle was named a starter to the All-Star Game in both 2009 and 2012. On December 14, 2009, almost three years after they traded him away, the Rock re-acquired Doyle from the Stealth for Lewis Ratcliff, Tyler Codron, and Joel Dalgarno. On November 9, 2016, Doyle announced his retirement from lacrosse.

Early life  Blumkin was born into a Jewish shopkeepers' family, was orphaned early in his life, and was raised in Odessa. After four years in a Jewish school, he was sent to work running errands for shops and offices. In 1914 he joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.  Cheka employee  After the October Revolution in 1917, he became head of the Cheka's counter-espionage department working for Felix Dzerzhinsky.  Terrorist  Like many Cheka employees at the time, Blumkin was, politically, a Left Socialist-Revolutionary rather than a Bolshevik. Since this party was opposed to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Blumkin was ordered by its executive committee to assassinate Wilhelm von Mirbach, the German ambassador to Russia; they hoped by this action to incite a war with Germany. This event was timed to occur at the opening of the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. On the afternoon of 6 July 1918, Blumkin - along with an aide, Nikolai Andreyev - went to the residence of the German Ambassador on Denezhny Lane. Blumkin gained entrance to the embassy by presenting forged documents. When Mirbach entered the drawing room, Blumkin pulled a gun from his case and shot the ambassador at point blank range, killing him. At the same time, the Left SRs launched a coup attempt in Moscow, which was quickly quelled. The members of the Left SR party at the Bolshoi Theater were arrested and the party was forcibly suppressed. Blumkin, however, escaped and went into hiding. He fled to Petrograd and then to Ukraine where he joined the LSR Cheka. In Kiev he organized an assassination attempt against the Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi and fought in the LSR insurrection against the government of Symon Petliura. In April 1919 Blumkin surrendered to the Bolsheviks, who still had a warrant for his arrest. Dzerzhinsky pardoned Blumkin, due to his voluntary surrender, and ordered him to return to Ukraine to assassinate Admiral Kolchak. While forming a combat group, Blumkin survived three assassination attempts made by his former LSR comrades. He joined the 13th Red Army as director of counter-espionage and worked under Georgy Pyatakov.  Persia  In the spring of 1920, Dzerzhinsky sent Blumkin to the Iranian province of Gilan, on the Caspian Sea, where the Forest Party under the leadership of Mirza Koochak Khan had established a secessionist government called the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic. On 30 May 1920, Blumkin, with his penchant for intrigue, fomented a coup d'√©tat which drove Koochak Khan and his party from power and replaced them with the Bolshevik-controlled Iranian Communist Party. The new government, nominally headed by Kuchak Khan's second- in-command, Ehsanollah Khan, was dominated by the Russian Commissar, Abukov. He commenced a series of radical reforms which included the closing of mosques and confiscating money from the rich. Blumkin became chief of the General Staff of the Persian Red Army. An army was raised with the intention of marching on Tehran and bringing Persia under the Red Banner. In August 1920, Blumkin was back in Petrograd where he was entrusted with the command of an armored train that conveyed Grigory Zinoviev, Karl Radek, B√©la Kun, and John Silas Reed from the Second Congress of the Communist InternationalHistory of the Communist International at www.marxists.org to the Congress of Oppressed Nationalities in Baku.History of the Communist International at www.marxists.org Their journey took them through parts of Western Russia where the Civil War still lingered. Blumkin claimed he served as a member of the Persian delegation, perhaps incognito because his name is not listed in the published rolls. At the congress, the delegates enacted the proposal of Zinoviev, leader of the Comintern, which called upon the Bolsheviks to support the uprisings of native peoples from the Middle East against the British. Lenin shortly afterwards abandoned this policy in order to sign a treaty with Great Britain.  Relations with Poets  Blumkin was a lover of poetry. There was an extraordinary incident in July 1921, when Nikolay Gumilyov - a monarchist, who was shot soon afterwards - was giving a poetry recital in a cafe in Petrograd, when \\"a man in a leather jacket\\", described as having \\"bold features, framed by a black beard, and his face looked biblical\\", began reciting as if \\"drunk on Gumilyov's verses.\\" Gumilyov was astonished when the man introduced as the notorious Yakov Blyumkin, and remarked: \\"I'm happy when my poems are read by warriors and people of great strength.\\" Gumilyov later wrote that \\"The man amidst crowd who shot the Imperial Ambassador came up to shake me by the hand and thank me for my verses\\". In 1923, the diplomat Alexander Barmine travelled by train from Moscow to Baku with Blumkin, and the poet Sergei Yesenin, who was on a downward slide and committed suicide months later. Barmine recalled that \\"They got on well together and never went to bed sober. Blumkin, whose soldierly temperament always saved him from excesses, had saddled himself with the job of 'pulling Sergei together'. It was more than anyone could do.\\" Blumkin was often seen maundering about in Moscow with poets as an adherent of the Imaginism literary movement to which Esenin belonged, boasting a gun and a notorious reputation.[–†–æ–π–∑–º–∞–Ω, –ú. 1973. –í—Å–µ, —á—Ç–æ –ø–æ–º–Ω—é –æ –ï—Å–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–µ. –ì–ª–∞–≤–∞ 13.] Blumkin also knew Osip Mandelstam. There is a story told by Mandelstam's biographer Clarence Brown:Osip Mandelstam (ed. Clarence Brown) 1973. Cited by Isaiah Berlin in \\"The Soviet Mind: Russian Culture Under Communism\\" Mandelstam's widow told a different, and probably more accurate version of the story. She said that Blumkin tried to persuade Mandelstam to work for Cheka, soon after it was founded and before the Mirbach assassination. Blumkin was also a regular and \\"welcome\\" guest in the Poets' Cafe, in Moscow, where Mandelstam overheard him boasting that he was going to have an art historian shot. Mandelstam, who did not know the intended victim, was so angry that he persuaded the poetry-loving Bolshevik Larissa Reissner to join him in a direct approach to the head of Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and saved the man's life. In 1919, Mandelstam and his wife were on a balcony in Kiev, when Blumkin rode past at the head of a cavalcade, dressed in a black coat, and when he saw Mandelstam, drew a pistol pointed it at him, but did not fire. He threatened Mandelstam with a gun several times, but never fired, and probably had no intention of killing him. When Blumkin returned from Persia, the French writer Victor Serge heard him declaim lines written by the Persian epic poet Ferdowsi. At that time Blumkin was \\"more poised and virile than ever, his face solid and smooth-shaven, the haughty profile of an Israelite warrior. He stayed in a small apartment in the Arbat quarter, bare except for a rug and a splendid stool, a gift from some Mongol prince; and crooked sabres hung over his bottles of excellent wine.\\"  Vagabond Agent  After his adventure in the Caucasus, Blumkin returned to Moscow and became a student at the military college. He befriended Leon Trotsky, becoming a secretary, and helped over the next two years with the \\"selection, critical checking, arrangement and correction of the material\\" in Trotsky's Military Writings (1923).Leon Trotsky: 1918 - How The Revolution Armed/Volume I (Author's Preface) at www.marxists.org Trotsky noted in particular the irony of a former Left SR conspirator editing the volume describing the Left SR conspiracy. Blumkin introduced Yesenin to Trotsky, hoping that Trotsky would sponsor and promote a literary journal. This sharing of friendship, scholarship, and political ideas with Trotsky would later cost Blumkin his life. In 1924 the OGPU made Blumkin an illegal resident in the Arab peninsula. From the summer of 1924 until the fall of 1925 he worked for the OGPU in Tiflis and was the Assistant Chairman of the Soviet delegation in the mixed Soviet-Persian Border commission and a member of the Soviet delegation in the mixed Soviet-Turkish Border commission. It is claimed that in 1924, he travelled secretly to Afghanistan or Pamir in order to contact the Ismailites and the local representative of the Aga Khan for the purposes of \\"anti-imperialist struggle\\" against the British, after which he disguised himself as a dervish and travelled with an Ismailite caravan, exploring the British military positions in India as far south as Ceylon.–°–∞–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á. 2000. –ê–≤–∞–Ω—Ç—é—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—ã –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ In 1926, Blumkin was supposedly the secret representative of the GPU in Mongolia, where he ruled for some time as a virtual dictator (and occasionally travelled on missions in China, Tibet and India) until he was recalled to Moscow because the local Communist leadership had tired of his reign of terror.–ë–∞–∂–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å. –í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –±—ã–≤—à–µ–≥–æ —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ä—è –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞. –ì–ª–∞–≤–∞ 17. –≠–º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è. –§–∏–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥–∏—è. –ë–µ—Ä–ª–∏–Ω. In his book, The Storm Petrels, Gordon Brook-Shepherd relates that the GPU sent Blumkin to Paris in October 1929 to assassinate the defector and former Stalin personal secretary, Boris Bazhanov. In fact, this information comes from Bazhanov himself. Although it became common gossip among the inmates of the labor camps that Blumkin had indeed killed Bazhanov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn repeats this legend in The Gulag Archipelago, the truth is that Bazhanov only died in 1983. Bazhanov at the time was also aware of the rumour of his own murder and wrote that Stalin had probably planted the rumour himself in order to instill fear. The end of life In 1929, Blumkin was the chief illegal resident in Turkey, where he was allegedly selling Hebrew incunabula that he collected from synagogues all over Ukraine and Southern Russia and even from state museums such as the Lenin Library in Moscow, in order to finance an espionage network in the Middle East. While he would supposedly travel personally to Ukraine to look for rare Hebrew books, he also spent time in Palestine and elsewhere organizing the network, posing as a devout Jewish laundry owner or as a Jewish salesman from Azerbaijan. Eventually he was deported from Palestine by the British. It is known that during his work in Turkey, Blumkin met with Trotsky, who was living there after his expulsion from the Soviet Union. Trotsky gave Blumkin a secret message to transmit to Karl Radek, Trotsky's former supporter and friend in Moscow, which was seen by Stalin as an attempt to set up lines of communication with \\"co-thinkers\\" and \\"oppositionists\\" in the Soviet Union. Information about the meeting reached the OGPU. Trotsky later claimed that Radek had betrayed Blumkin to Stalin, and Radek would later acknowledge his complicity, but it is also likely that the information was passed along by an OGPU informer within Trotsky's entourage. After Blumkin met with Radek in Moscow, Mikhail Trilisser, head of the OGPU Foreign Section, ordered an attractive agent named Lisa Gorskaya (aka Elizabeth Zubilin) to \\"abandon bourgeois prejudice\\" and seduce Blumkin. The couple carried on an affair lasting several weeks and Gorskaya revealed their pillow-talk to Trilisser. When agents sent to arrest Blumkin arrived at his apartment, he was getting into a car with Gorskaya. A chase ensued and shots were fired. Blumkin stopped the car, turned to Gorskaya and said: \\"Lisa, you have betrayed me!\\". Following his arrest, Blumkin was brought before an OGPU tribunal consisting of Yagoda, Menzhinsky, and Trilisser. The defector Georges Agabekov claims: \\"Yagoda pronounced for the death penalty. Trilliser was against it. Menzhinsky was undecided.\\" The matter was referred to the Politburo where Stalin, ending the deadlock, declared himself in favor of the death penalty. In his Memoirs of a Revolutionary (1941), Victor Serge relates that Blumkin was given a two-week reprieve so that he could write his autobiography. This manuscript, if indeed it ever existed, remains undiscovered. Alexander Orlov (Soviet defector) writes that Blumkin stood before a firing squad and shouted, \\"Long live Trotsky!\\". The Russian Government has never rehabilitated Blumkin.

The notion can be applied analogously to sequences on any finite alphabet (e.g. decimal digits). Random sequences are key objects of study in algorithmic information theory. As different types of algorithms are sometimes considered, ranging from algorithms with specific bounds on their running time to algorithms which may ask questions of an oracle machine, there are different notions of randomness. The most common of these is known as Martin-L√∂f randomness (K-randomness or 1-randomness), but stronger and weaker forms of randomness also exist. The term \\"algorithmically random\\" used to refer to a particular single (finite or infinite) sequence without clarification is usually taken to mean \\"incompressible\\" or, in the case the sequence is infinite and prefix algorithmically random (i.e., K-incompressible), \\"Martin-L√∂f-Chaitin random\\". It is important to disambiguate algorithmic randomness with stochastic randomness. Unlike algorithmic randomness, which is defined for computable (and thus deterministic) processes, stochastic randomness is usually said to be a property of a sequence that is a priori known to be generated (or is the outcome of) by an independent identically distributed equiprobable stochastic process. Because infinite sequences of binary digits can be identified with real numbers in the unit interval, random binary sequences are often called (algorithmically) random real numbers. Additionally, infinite binary sequences correspond to characteristic functions of sets of natural numbers; therefore those sequences might be seen as sets of natural numbers. The class of all Martin-L√∂f random (binary) sequences is denoted by RAND or MLR.  History  The first suitable definition of a random sequence was given by Per Martin-L√∂f in 1966. Earlier researchers such as Richard von Mises had attempted to formalize the notion of a test for randomness in order to define a random sequence as one that passed all tests for randomness; however, the precise notion of a randomness test was left vague. Martin-L√∂f's key insight was to use the theory of computation to formally define the notion of a test for randomness. This contrasts with the idea of randomness in probability; in that theory, no particular element of a sample space can be said to be random. Since its inception, Martin-L√∂f randomness has been shown to admit many equivalent characterizations ‚Äî in terms of compression, randomness tests, and gambling ‚Äî that bear little outward resemblance to the original definition, but each of which satisfy our intuitive notion of properties that random sequences ought to have: random sequences should be incompressible, they should pass statistical tests for randomness, and it should be difficult to make money betting on them. The existence of these multiple definitions of Martin-L√∂f randomness, and the stability of these definitions under different models of computation, give evidence that Martin-L√∂f randomness is a fundamental property of mathematics and not an accident of Martin-L√∂f's particular model. The thesis that the definition of Martin-L√∂f randomness \\"correctly\\" captures the intuitive notion of randomness has been called the Martin-L√∂f‚ÄìChaitin Thesis; it is somewhat similar to the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis.Jean-Paul Delahaye, Randomness, Unpredictability and Absence of Order, in Philosophy of Probability, p. 145-167, Springer 1993.  Three equivalent definitions  Martin-L√∂f's original definition of a random sequence was in terms of constructive null covers; he defined a sequence to be random if it is not contained in any such cover. Gregory Chaitin, Leonid Levin and Claus-Peter Schnorr proved a characterization in terms of algorithmic complexity: a sequence is random if there is a uniform bound on the compressibility of its initial segments. Schnorr gave a third equivalent definition in terms of martingales. Li and Vitanyi's book An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications is the standard introduction to these ideas. * Algorithmic complexity (Chaitin 1969, Schnorr 1973, Levin 1973): Algorithmic complexity (aka Kolmogorov complexity or program-size complexity) can be thought of as a lower bound on the algorithmic compressibility of a finite sequence (of characters or binary digits). It assigns to each such sequence w a natural number K(w) that, intuitively, measures the minimum length of a computer program (written in some fixed programming language) that takes no input and will output w when run. The complexity is required to be prefix- free: The program (a sequence of 0 and 1) is followed by an infinite string of 0s, and the length of the program (assuming it halts) includes the number of zeroes to the right of the program that the universal Turing machine reads. The additional requirement is needed because we can choose a length such that the length codes information about the substring. Given a natural number c and a sequence w, we say that w is c-incompressible if K(w) \\\\geq w - c . :An infinite sequence S is Martin-L√∂f random if and only if there is a constant c such that all of Ss finite prefixes are c-incompressible.'' * Constructive null covers (Martin-L√∂f 1966): This is Martin-L√∂f's original definition. For a finite binary string w we let Cw denote the cylinder generated by w. This is the set of all infinite sequences beginning with w, which is a basic open set in Cantor space. The product measure Œº(Cw) of the cylinder generated by w is defined to be 2‚àíw. Every open subset of Cantor space is the union of a countable sequence of disjoint basic open sets, and the measure of an open set is the sum of the measures of any such sequence. An effective open set is an open set that is the union of the sequence of basic open sets determined by a recursively enumerable sequence of binary strings. A constructive null cover or effective measure 0 set is a recursively enumerable sequence U_i of effective open sets such that U_{i+1} \\\\subseteq U_i and \\\\mu (U_i) \\\\leq 2^{-i} for each natural number i. Every effective null cover determines a G_\\\\delta set of measure 0, namely the intersection of the sets U_i. :A sequence is defined to be Martin-L√∂f random if it is not contained in any G_\\\\delta set determined by a constructive null cover. * Constructive martingales (Schnorr 1971): A martingale is a function d:\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^*\\\\to[0,\\\\infty) such that, for all finite strings w, d(w) = (d(w^\\\\smallfrown 0) + d(w^\\\\smallfrown 1))/2, where a^\\\\smallfrown b is the concatenation of the strings a and b. This is called the \\"fairness condition\\": if a martingale is viewed as a betting strategy, then the above condition requires that the bettor plays against fair odds. A martingale d is said to succeed on a sequence S if \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} d(S \\\\upharpoonright n) = \\\\infty, where S \\\\upharpoonright n is the first n bits of S. A martingale d is constructive (also known as weakly computable, lower semi-computable) if there exists a computable function \\\\widehat{d}:\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^*\\\\times\\\\N\\\\to{\\\\mathbb{Q}} such that, for all finite binary strings w # \\\\widehat{d}(w,t) \\\\leq \\\\widehat{d}(w,t+1) < d(w), for all positive integers t, # \\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\widehat{d}(w,t) = d(w). :A sequence is Martin-L√∂f random if and only if no constructive martingale succeeds on it.  Interpretations of the definitions  The Kolmogorov complexity characterization conveys the intuition that a random sequence is incompressible: no prefix can be produced by a program much shorter than the prefix. The null cover characterization conveys the intuition that a random real number should not have any property that is \\"uncommon\\". Each measure 0 set can be thought of as an uncommon property. It is not possible for a sequence to lie in no measure 0 sets, because each one-point set has measure 0. Martin-L√∂f's idea was to limit the definition to measure 0 sets that are effectively describable; the definition of an effective null cover determines a countable collection of effectively describable measure 0 sets and defines a sequence to be random if it does not lie in any of these particular measure 0 sets. Since the union of a countable collection of measure 0 sets has measure 0, this definition immediately leads to the theorem that there is a measure 1 set of random sequences. Note that if we identify the Cantor space of binary sequences with the interval [0,1] of real numbers, the measure on Cantor space agrees with Lebesgue measure. The martingale characterization conveys the intuition that no effective procedure should be able to make money betting against a random sequence. A martingale d is a betting strategy. d reads a finite string w and bets money on the next bit. It bets some fraction of its money that the next bit will be 0, and then remainder of its money that the next bit will be 1. d doubles the money it placed on the bit that actually occurred, and it loses the rest. d(w) is the amount of money it has after seeing the string w. Since the bet placed after seeing the string w can be calculated from the values d(w), d(w0), and d(w1), calculating the amount of money it has is equivalent to calculating the bet. The martingale characterization says that no betting strategy implementable by any computer (even in the weak sense of constructive strategies, which are not necessarily computable) can make money betting on a random sequence. Properties and examples of Martin-L√∂f random sequences * Chaitin's halting probability Œ© is an example of a random sequence. * RANDc (the complement of RAND) is a measure 0 subset of the set of all infinite sequences. This is implied by the fact that each constructive null cover covers a measure 0 set, there are only countably many constructive null covers, and a countable union of measure 0 sets has measure 0. This implies that RAND is a measure 1 subset of the set of all infinite sequences. * Every random sequence is normal. * There is a constructive null cover of RANDc. This means that all effective tests for randomness (that is, constructive null covers) are, in a sense, subsumed by this universal test for randomness, since any sequence that passes this single test for randomness will pass all tests for randomness. (Martin-L√∂f 1966) * There is a universal constructive martingale d. This martingale is universal in the sense that, given any constructive martingale d, if d succeeds on a sequence, then d succeeds on that sequence as well. Thus, d succeeds on every sequence in RANDc (but, since d is constructive, it succeeds on no sequence in RAND). (Schnorr 1971) * The class RAND is a \\\\Sigma^0_2 subset of Cantor space, where \\\\Sigma^0_2 refers to the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy. This is because a sequence S is in RAND if and only if there is some open set in the universal effective null cover that does not contain S; this property can be seen to be definable by a \\\\Sigma^0_2 formula. * There is a random sequence which is \\\\Delta^0_2, that is, computable relative to an oracle for the Halting problem. (Schnorr 1971) Chaitin's Œ© is an example of such a sequence. * No random sequence is decidable, computably enumerable, or co- computably-enumerable. Since these correspond to the \\\\Delta_1^0, \\\\Sigma_1^0, and \\\\Pi_1^0 levels of the arithmetical hierarchy, this means that \\\\Delta_2^0 is the lowest level in the arithmetical hierarchy where random sequences can be found. * Every sequence is Turing reducible to some random sequence. (Kuƒçera 1985/1989, G√°cs 1986). Thus there are random sequences of arbitrarily high Turing degree.  Relative randomness  As each of the equivalent definitions of a Martin-L√∂f random sequence is based on what is computable by some Turing machine, one can naturally ask what is computable by a Turing oracle machine. For a fixed oracle A, a sequence B which is not only random but in fact, satisfies the equivalent definitions for computability relative to A (e.g., no martingale which is constructive relative to the oracle A succeeds on B) is said to be random relative to A. Two sequences, while themselves random, may contain very similar information, and therefore neither will be random relative to the other. Any time there is a Turing reduction from one sequence to another, the second sequence cannot be random relative to the first, just as computable sequences are themselves nonrandom; in particular, this means that Chaitin's Œ© is not random relative to the halting problem. An important result relating to relative randomness is van Lambalgen's theorem, which states that if C is the sequence composed from A and B by interleaving the first bit of A, the first bit of B, the second bit of A, the second bit of B, and so on, then C is algorithmically random if and only if A is algorithmically random, and B is algorithmically random relative to A. A closely related consequence is that if A and B are both random themselves, then A is random relative to B if and only if B is random relative to A.  Stronger than Martin-L√∂f randomness  Relative randomness gives us the first notion which is stronger than Martin-L√∂f randomness, which is randomness relative to some fixed oracle A. For any oracle, this is at least as strong, and for most oracles, it is strictly stronger, since there will be Martin-L√∂f random sequences which are not random relative to the oracle A. Important oracles often considered are the halting problem, \\\\emptyset ', and the nth jump oracle, \\\\emptyset^{(n)}, as these oracles are able to answer specific questions which naturally arise. A sequence which is random relative to the oracle \\\\emptyset^{(n-1)} is called n-random; a sequence is 1-random, therefore, if and only if it is Martin-L√∂f random. A sequence which is n-random for every n is called arithmetically random. The n-random sequences sometimes arise when considering more complicated properties. For example, there are only countably many \\\\Delta^0_2 sets, so one might think that these should be non-random. However, the halting probability Œ© is \\\\Delta^0_2 and 1-random; it is only after 2-randomness is reached that it is impossible for a random set to be \\\\Delta^0_2.  Weaker than Martin-L√∂f randomness  Additionally, there are several notions of randomness which are weaker than Martin-L√∂f randomness. Some of these are weak 1-randomness, Schnorr randomness, computable randomness, partial computable randomness. Yongge Wang showed Yongge Wang: Randomness and Complexity. PhD Thesis, 1996, http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/thesis.pdf that Schnorr randomness is different from computable randomness. Additionally, Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness is known to be no stronger than Martin-L√∂f randomness, but it is not known whether it is actually weaker. At the opposite end of the randomness spectrum there is the notion of a K-trivial set. These sets are anti-random in that all initial segment is logarithmically compressible (i.e., K(w) \\\\leq K(w) + b for each initial segment w), but they are not computable.

Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s, the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built. The portion of \\"Interstate 470\\" that was built as a state highway is the present-day SH 470, which is a freeway for its entire length. The route has previously been called the Centennial Freeway. Route description SH 470 begins in Golden as an extension of Johnson Road at an intersection with US 6 (6th Avenue) near the Jefferson County government office complex and its adjacent light rail station. The interchange also includes direct ramps to westbound US 6, which continues northwest towards central Golden and east to Denver. SH 470 travels south from the intersection on a four-lane freeway and passes over US 40 before reaching an interchange with I-70 near Tin Cup Hogback Park. The freeway expands to six lanes and continues south along the side of Green Mountain on the western outskirts of Lakewood. It intersects SH 8 at a single-point urban interchange in Morrison near the Bandimere Speedway complex. From Morrison, SH 470 begins a gradual turn to the southeast as it passes between Mount Glennon and Bear Creek Lake Regional Park. It intersects US 285, a minor freeway that travels east through Lakewood, and continues south with four lanes along the edge of a hogback at the edge of the Denver area's suburban sprawl, served by several exits on the freeway. SH 470 turns east in Ken Caryl near Hildebrand Ranch and intersects SH 121 at the western edge of the Chatfield Reservoir. The freeway turns northeast and dips into Columbine as it skirts the northern edge of the reservoir and its dam before coming to an interchange with US 85\\\\. SH 470 gains a parallel multi-use trail for pedestrians and bicycles that follows the freeway as it enters Highlands Ranch in Douglas County. The freeway cuts through the northern edge of Highlands Ranch's residential neighborhoods, intersecting SH 177\\\\. SH 470 dips to the south to follow Willow Creek around the Park Meadows shopping mall in Lone Tree, terminating at a stack interchange with I-25. The freeway continues east onto the E-470 tollway, which completes a half-loop around the eastern suburbs of Denver. History Proposed I-470 In the 1960s the Colorado Department of Transportation perceived a need for a beltway around the Denver Metro Area and sent a proposal to the Federal Highway Administration. The plan was for the federal government to provide 90% of funds for the project with the state providing the difference. I-470 was added to the Federal Highway Act of 1968 and was to be part of the Interstate Highway and Defense System. The Denver City Council approved the location and began engineering and environmental impact studies. After a few months the studies went under analysis with negative feedback. The Colorado Department of Health was opposed to the interstate beltway on the grounds that it would violate the Federal Clean Air Act. Other studies compared the proposed I-470 to the I-25 and I-225 freeways suggesting that alternate uses for the land (other than freeways) would be more environmentally friendly. I-470 to Centennial Parkway In response to feedback from the Colorado Department of Health, the governor ordered all efforts to plan and build the beltway to cease. A separate commission was established by Governor Richard Lamm to determine the best course of action. The commission came up with 11 alternatives. The final decision was to use federal highway funds to build a grand parkway known as Centennial Parkway (a partial beltway in the southwest portion of the metro area) and widen existing roads. Centennial Parkway to SH 470 As the southwestern area grew rapidly, plans for Centennial Parkway evolved to conform to freeway standards. The proposed road was designated State Highway 470. Present-day SH 470 is a freeway that is mostly built to interstate standards. Expansion After the completion of C-470 in the southwest, desires for a full beltway persisted in some circles and plans for an extension were created. CDOT did not wish to participate in the building of the freeway extension and left the counties and cities of the metro area to provide funding for the project. The east, north, and northwest portions of the beltway could only be built as tollways. Currently, tolled express lanes are under construction along the C-470 portion of the beltway, two westbound toll lanes from Interstate 25 to Colorado Boulevard (no interchange), and then one westbound toll lane from Colorado Boulevard to State Route 121 (Wadsworth Boulevard). Then, there will be one eastbound toll lane from just west of the Platte River overpass to Interstate 25. E-470 A tollway extension of SH 470, east and north of the SH 470 eastern terminus, was built to the junction with State Highway 83 (Parker Road) and termed Eastern/Extension 470 or E-470. Subsequently, E-470 was extended to the interchange with I-70 in the east, and later to I-25 in the north. This newly added tollway was built and continues to be administered by a quasi-governmental organization known as the E-470 Public Highway Authority. Northwest Parkway When freeway interests pushed for the rest of the beltway to be completed, the city of Golden voted to stop all efforts to finish the beltway due to traffic concerns. The city and county of Broomfield, Colorado constructed a continuation of the E-470 tollway from I-25 to an interchange with US 36 (the former Denver-Boulder Turnpike) near Flatiron Crossing Mall. This section of the tollway is known as the Northwest Parkway, and is administered, similarly to E-470, by its own quasi-governmental agency. In conjunction with E-470 (47 miles) and SH 470 (27 miles), the Northwest Parkway brings the total length of the completed portion of the beltway around the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area to approximately . The uncompleted portion, from the west end of the Northwest Parkway to the northwest end of SH 470, is along existing streets. In 2007, the Portuguese company BRISA paid $603 million to operate the road for the following 99 years, until 2106. The lease included a clause restricting a \\"Competing Transportation Facility. This clause was invoked in an April 30, 2008 letter when Broomfield wished to make changes to 160th Ave. Proposed W-470 As of August 2003, CDOT made a compromise with the cities of Westminster, Arvada and Golden to do an environmental impact study, the first step in an attempt to complete the beltway by 2020. The last segment of the beltway would be another tollway, tentatively called W-470, and would connect the west end of the Northwest Parkway to the northwest end of SH 470. Jefferson Parkway The Jefferson Parkway is the planned extension to the beltway to begin at the Northwest Parkway and end at SH 93. It is currently in its planning phase. Jefferson County, Broomfield and Arvada have formed the Jefferson Parkway Public Highway Authority to construct the freeway. If the 20-mile parkway is constructed, Denver will be completely encircled by a \\"metropolitan beltway.\\" Exit list Controversy The completion of the freeway has been mired in controversy. In 1975 Colorado Governor Dick Lamm vowed to \\"drive a silver spike\\" through the plans for the road. In 1989 voters turned down an expansion of the freeway by a four-to-one margin. In the late 1990s a citizens group called Citizens Involved in the Northwest Quadrant (CINQ) was formed to oppose the completion of the freeway. In 2008, a group of Arvada residents sued to try and stop the city from joining the newly formed JPPHA. The completion of the freeway continues to have a primary proponent in the cities of Arvada and Broomfield who feel, among other things, it will financially benefit them. A number of localities, including the Town of Superior, the city of Wheat Ridge, and the city of Golden have fought the completion of the road citing, among other things, a decrease in their quality of life.

History In the late 1940s, when ‚Äúsufficient funds were present‚Äù to hire an architect, plans were designed, a site was donated and the Community Memorial Hospital was built. An editorial in the Monitor at the time stated this about the original building: ‚ÄúTo say that Clarion‚Äôs hospital is one of the finest structures we have ever seen is a gross understatement.‚Äù Since that time, several major additions and renovations were completed in 1962, 1966, 1972, 1982, 1992 and in 1997 when Project Healthcare was completed and a new nine bed wing was opened. Community Memorial Hospital admitted its first patient on November 29, 1951. On July 2, 1993. The Meadows independent retirement community was opened. Bob and Jane Davison donated the land where the Meadows is built. Bob Davison donated the land with his wife, Jane; Bob Kay brought the idea of an independent retirement facility to Clarion and then did much of the research on the project and Bob Eaton contributed design ideas along with Bob Orcutt. In 2006 an addition was built at the south-east corner of the complex and the entire building was remodeled at a cost of $4.5 million. Also at that time an addition was built to the Meadows which houses an 18-unit assisted living facility. In 2010 an addition was built to the south housing new operating rooms. In 2007, Wright Medical Center and Belmond Medical Center began collaboration by sharing administration, physicians and other ways to minimize the number of patients leaving Wright County for healthcare. In 2012 the two hospitals restructured and renamed themselves as Iowa Specialty Hospitals & Clinics, with main campuses in Clarion and Belmond. Additionally, a medical clinic was opened in Hampton, Iowa. Although the two hospitals are two separate organizations, the share administration and staff and seem to operate as one hospital.

Built in 1891, it is the oldest house in its original location in Miami-Dade County. The Barnacle was the home of Ralph Middleton Munroe, one of Coconut Grove's founders, as well as founder and Commodore of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club. He was also a leading designer of sailing yachts. The Florida Park Service acquired the remaining of Munroe's original homesite from his descendants in 1973. The Barnacle Historic State Park is served by the Miami Metrorail at the Douglas Road and the Coconut Grove stations. History Historic marker at front entrance on Main Highway Ralph Middleton Munroe first visited South Florida in 1877 while on vacation from New York City. On his second trip he brought his wife who suffered from tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the cure failed and she died. Her body is buried in Coconut Grove. He returned several times to the area and in 1887 decided to settle in the Bay. Ralph Munroe purchased of bayfront land in 1886 for $400 in addition to one of his sailboats, the Kingfish, valued at an additional $400. His boathouse was built in 1887 and he lived on its upper floor until his main house was completed in 1891. The house, a one-story structure, was raised off the ground on wood pilings. Its central room is octagonal in shape and Munroe called his home \\"The Barnacle,\\" presumably because it resembled one. It remained a bungalow until 1908 when more space was needed for his growing family. The whole structure was lifted and a new first story inserted below. In 1912 a library was built adjacent to the house. The Barnacle survived the disastrous 1926 hurricane and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 with only minimal damage. Ralph Munroe's principal passion in life was designing yachts. Boats were the major form of transportation in the early days of Coconut Grove and yachting was a popular sport. Many South Floridians commissioned Munroe to design their yachts. In 1887, a group of residents formed the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club, electing Munroe as Commodore, a title that he held for 22 years. In his lifetime, he drew plans for 56 different yachts. Micco, one of the last of Munroe's boats, was displayed at the park until Hurricane Andrew reduced the 101-year-old vessel to fragments. Egret, a replica of Munroe's modified sharpie is now moored offshore. As a seaman, civic activist, naturalist, and photographer, Commodore Munroe was a man who cherished the natural world around him. A walk into the park passes through a tropical hardwood hammock. It is representative of the original landscape within the city of Miami. Today, it is one of the last remnants of the once vast Miami Hammock. Regatta In the spring of 1887 Ralph Munroe organized a regatta on Biscayne Bay with fifteen boats divided into three classes. \\"The winners were Ada (Captain Brickell), Maggie (Captain Carney) and Edna (Captain Addison), while Alfred Munroe and Charles Peacock were timekeepers and judges. After the race all hands, about fifty in number, participated in a good dinner at Peacock's (the Peacock Inn), given by the promoters. Thus began organized aquatic sports on the Bay, the Washington's Birthday Regatta afterwards being a fixture of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club, until the displacement of sails by gasoline in general interest caused it to degenerate into a \\"Chowder-party\\".

Activities Daytime activities include touring the historic site, picnicking, and wildlife viewing. Concerts and other events are held frequently throughout the year, making it a popular destination in Miami. Hours of operation The Barnacle is open 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with tours at 10, 11:30 a.m.; 1 and 2:30 p.m. Friday through Monday and for groups by reservation Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The park is closed on Tuesdays, New Year's, Thanksgiving, and Christmas days. Park fees Admission to the park is $2 per person for everyone ages 6 and over. Admission may be paid at an honor pay station located inside the park near the restrooms, or in the park gift shop. To go inside the house guests are required to take the guided tour which is an additional $3 per person for everyone over the age of 12 and $1 for children ages 6‚Äì12. Tours are available at 10a, 11:30a, 1p, and 2:30p on a first-come, first-served basis. Location and parking Sign at front entrance on Main Highway The entrance is on the Northbound side of Main Highway between Abitare and The Cloister Townhomes. There is no parking available in the park itself, except for those with disabilities. However, there is a public parking lot next to the Coconut Grove playhouse and street parking throughout the neighborhood.

Pricing for upgrades purchased through Anytime Upgrade was also reduced when compared with traditional retail packaging. In Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, the feature was re-branded as Add features to Windows and was used to purchase an upgrade license to the Pro edition of the operating system or to add Windows Media Center to an existing Pro edition installation. However, support for this feature in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 was dropped on October 31, 2015. History left Windows Anytime Upgrade was in development prior to the development reset of Windows Vista, then known by its codename \\"Longhorn.\\" A preliminary version of the feature can be seen in build 4093. On February 26, 2006, Microsoft announced the editions of Windows Vista to be released to retail and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). After this announcement, various technology-related outlets reported that Anytime Upgrade would enable users to upgrade to successive editions. Overview Windows Vista version All editions of Windows Vista, excluding Enterprise, are stored on the same retail and OEM optical media‚Äîa license key for the edition purchased determines which version is eligible to be installed. When first announced, Anytime Upgrade enabled users to purchase a digital license from an online merchant to upgrade their edition of Windows Vista. Once a license had been purchased, a user's product license, billing and other information would be stored within a user's digital locker at the Windows Marketplace digital distribution platform; this would allow a user to retain this information at an off-site location for reference purposes and to reinstall the operating system, if necessary. A user could then initiate an upgrade to the edition for which the license was purchased either through components stored on the hard drive by the OEM of the personal computer, through an Anytime Upgrade DVD supplied by the OEM, or through retail installation media compatible with Anytime Upgrade. If none of these options were available, Anytime Upgrade provided an option for a user to purchase a DVD online and have it delivered by mail. Microsoft also released retail packaging for Anytime Upgrade. The retail products were made available during the consumer launch of Windows Vista on January 30, 2007. The initial version of these products included only an upgrade license, but this was later modified in May 2007 to include both a DVD and a product license. In an effort to streamline the upgrade process, Microsoft announced that digital license distribution would cease on February 20, 2008; licenses purchased prior to this date would not be affected. As a result of this change, users would be required to purchase the aforementioned retail packaging in order to use Anytime Upgrade functionality and Windows Vista Service Pack 1 omitted the option to purchase a license online. DVDs for Anytime Upgrade were only produced for Windows Vista. Anytime Upgrade in Windows Vista performs a full reinstallation of the new product edition while retaining the user's data, programs, and settings. This process can take a considerable amount of time, up to a few hours. Windows 7 version Anytime Upgrade in Windows 7 no longer performs a full reinstallation of Windows. Components for the upgraded editions are instead pre-installed directly in the operating system; a notable result of this change is that the speed of the upgrade process has been significantly decreased. Microsoft stated that an upgrade should take approximately 10 minutes. Anytime Upgrade also does not require physical media or additional software. Instead, Windows 7 requires a user to purchase a license online, in a manner similar to the initial functionality that was later removed from Windows Vista starting with Service Pack 1. Microsoft would also release Anytime Upgrade packaging for Windows 7 at retail. The packaging, however, would only include a license for the edition to be upgraded, as Anytime Upgrade in the operating system does not require physical media. Region availability When first announced, Anytime Upgrade was available in the United States, Canada, EMEA, European Union, Norway, Switzerland, and Japan, with Microsoft stating that availability of the program would expand after launch of Windows Vista. English version retail packaging for Anytime Upgrade was made available at the consumer launch of Windows Vista for North America and Asia-Pacific regions. In 2009, Ars Technica reported that Anytime Upgrade retail packaging for Windows 7 may only have been available in regions without broadband Internet access or where retail packaging was ineligible to be offered. Anytime Upgrade was available for Windows 7 in select regions.

The park was created and named for Queen Victoria's jubilee in 1887. The main entrances to the park are from Westland Drive, Victoria Park Drive North, and Balshagray Avenue. The Friends of Victoria Park (FoVP) is a West Glasgow group set up to protect and develop Victoria Park. Main features There are a number of features within Victoria Park: *A memorial honouring the local residents who died in World War I and World War II. *A children's playpark with climbing frames and swings. *A pond, with two small islands. The larger island is connected on both sides by iron bridges. *A fully restored four-dial miniature lamp post clock, donated by William Gordon Oswald in 1888. *The Jubilee Gates situated at the Victoria Park North Drive entrance were erected and funded by the 'Ladies of Partick' in 1887. They were manufactured by Macfarlane's Saracen foundry at a cost of ¬£100. They bear the Partick Burgh coat of arms. In 1987 (the gates' centenary year) they underwent a restoration, and the gates have recently had another restoration to the original colours of red and gold. *The Fossil Grove - During the park's construction in the late 19th century, when a pilot channel for the road was cut through a large area of rock, the builders discovered preserved fossilised tree trunks. The route for the road was then diverted and the sand and shale further excavated to reveal more fossils. *Scotlands only wild breeding parakeet flock. Facilities Victoria Park has the following facilities; * An orienteering course * A model yachting course * Children's play areas * Bowling greens * Tennis courts * Basketball courts * A putting course * Several gardens History At the instigation of the Council, the work of building the park was supervised by Isdale Robertson (1848‚Äì1904) who had his premises in Anderson Street, Partick. The workforce was made up of unemployed men in need of an occupation to see them through a difficult period. It was this team of men who unearthed the fossil grove. It was also at the insistence of Isdale that the four faced clock was placed in the park. According to his adopted daughter, Meg Crerar, it bore the inscription \\"Now is the day of salvation, Now is the accepted time, Now is the day of Salvation\\". The gates were paid for by local women who subscribed a penny each, said to be partly in gratitude for providing work for their men and partly for keeping them sober, Whiteinch having been designated a \\"dry\\" area. Isdale Robertson was an active member of the Whiteinch United Free Church and a dedicated promoter of temperance. He joined Partick Town Council in November 1903 on that platform. By 1978 it was still a \\"dry\\" area. The park was formally opened by the Provost of Partick, Sir Andrew McLean on 2 July 1887. The arboretum section of the park was originally designed as an educational facility. During the 1960s, a large section of the park was removed in order to make way for the approach roads to the Clyde Tunnel and Expressway. Events Victoria Park plays host to several events such as the Whiteinch Fair Festival and the Indian Summer music festival. The park is also home to the Victoria Cricket and Hyndland FC rugby club. Throughout the summer, the Countryside Rangers arrange walks to educate children about the environment. The park is now home to the fledgling Scottish Australian Rules Football League clubs, the Glasgow Sharks and the Glasgow Magpies and is understood to be the UK's only dedicated Australian Rules Football ground. It is also the home ground of the Glasgow Centurions Touch Rugby Club. Travel * Rail - There are stations at Hyndland and Jordanhill, both of which are approximately a fifteen-minute walk away. * Bus - Several routes operate from Glasgow city centre to Dumbarton Road, Crow Road and Victoria Park Drive North. All of these are within five minutes walk from the park gates. * Car - There is some parking around the park perimeter, in particular along Victoria Park Drive North. Television The park featured in the Scottish sitcom Still Game in the episode 'Hot Seat'. The programme features views of the park and scenes of the surrounding area. The park is also featured in Limmy's Show, in a sketch in which Limmy bemoans the poor state of the railings around the park.

She was the Fourth Circuit's first female African American judge. Background Duncan received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hampton University in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from Duke University School of Law in 1975. She was an associate editor at the Lawyers Co-Operative Publishing Company from 1976 to 1977. Duncan then served for one year as a law clerk to Judge Julia Cooper Mack of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals from 1977 to 1978. In 1978, Duncan joined the staff of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. By the time she left in 1986 she had served in a variety of important posts at the commission: appellate attorney, assistant to the deputy general counsel, assistant to the chairman, acting associate legal counsel, and acting legal counsel. At one point, the then-head of the EEOC, Clarence Thomas, promoted Duncan as his chief of staff over another candidate, Anita Hill. At North Carolina Central University School of Law, Duncan served as an associate professor from 1986 to 1990, teaching property law, appellate advocacy, and employment discrimination. In 1990, she served briefly on the North Carolina Court of Appeals as an Associate Judge. She was appointed by Governor James G. Martin to replace Charles Becton but lost the following election to James A. Wynn. Duncan was appointed a Commissioner of the North Carolina Utilities Commission in 1991 and remained in that post until 1998, when she joined the Raleigh office of Kilpatrick Stockton as a partner. She worked there until her appointment to the federal bench. Duncan became the first African-American president of the North Carolina Bar Association in 2003. Federal judicial service Duncan was nominated on April 28, 2003, by President George W. Bush to fill a vacancy on the Fourth Circuit created by Judge Samuel J. Ervin III, who died on September 18, 1999. A Republican, Duncan was supported by both Senators Elizabeth Dole and John Edwards, a departure from the trend toward partisan controversy over North Carolina appointments to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Bill Clinton previously had nominated Professor S. Elizabeth Gibson to the seat late in his presidency, but Gibson never received a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing or vote before his presidency ended. The United States Senate confirmed Duncan by a vote of 93‚Äì0 on July 17, 2003, and she received her commission on August 15, 2003. She was the third judge nominated to the Fourth Circuit by Bush and confirmed by the Senate. In May 2018, Duncan announced that she would take senior status, effective upon the confirmation of her successor. In September 2018, President Donald Trump nominated Allison Jones Rushing to replace Duncan on the 4th circuit. Rushing was confirmed by the Senate on March 5, 2019. Duncan assumed senior status on March 21, 2019, and retired on July 31, 2019.

Owned by The Glasgow Academical Club, a sports and social club for alumni of The Glasgow Academy, it is the home ground of Glasgow Academicals RFC and Glasgow Academical Cricket Club. History New Anniesland was opened in 1902, following The Glasgow Academy's purchase of farmland adjacent to their existing sports ground, which they had occupied since 1883. The original ground, subsequently called Old Anniesland, was then taken over by the University of Glasgow. A cricket pavilion, groundsman's house and small grandstand, designed by the Laird brothers, were built in 1908. The ground also included curling rinks at this time. The original pavilion is still in use by the Glasgow Academical Cricket Club in the 21st century, albeit with later extensions, and is thought to be the oldest cricket pavilion in Glasgow. Wooden terraces and stands were constructed for rugby matches, and a crowd of 10,000 ‚Äî then a record for Scottish club rugby ‚Äî watched Glasgow Accies play Heriot's FP in 1922. Although these structures no longer exist, the ground still features a small timber grandstand, backing onto Helensburgh Drive, which dates to 1958. The ground hosted fixtures during the 2004 IRB Under 21 Rugby World Cup, and was used as a training ground for international teams preparing for the Rugby Sevens at Ibrox during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. International cricket New Anniesland was one of the venues when Scotland hosted the European Cricket Championship in 2000 and 2006. In 2000, it staged Israel's matches against Portugal and Greece.

He asked Ted White to collaborate on it with him, but after reviewing the manuscript White never got started.

Work proceeded sporadically over several years as each author forgot about it in turn (and Zelazny's cat took the opportunity to urinate on the original manuscript). But they finished it quickly in the spring of 1975 when the publisher demanded the manuscript or repayment of the advance paid to Dick. The editor discovered Zelazny had sent photocopies of some pages and demanded the originals as per Doubleday's policy; much to Zelazny's chagrin, he had to send in the urine-stained pages and he always wondered what the editor made of them.\\"...And Call Me Roger\\": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 2, by Christopher S.

Fallout and radiation has caused widespread mutations to human and animal populations alike. There is a new messianic religion, akin to gnosticism. The members of this religion, known as the Servants of Wrath or SOWs, worship the creator and detonator of the war's ultimate weapon, Carleton Lufteufel (from the German words \\"Luft,\\" meaning \\"air,\\" and \\"Teufel,\\" meaning \\"Devil\\"), ex-chairman of the Energy Research and Development Agency of the United States of America - ERDA/USA. In Charlottesville, Utah, there are ample debates between the Servants of Wrath and the diminishing congregations of Christians left in existence. The Servants of Wrath's faith is based on an \\"anger-driven\\" traditional perception of godhood, compared to that of the Christian survivors, and it is from this that the book derives its name- deus irae, Latin for \\"God of Wrath\\". Tibor McMasters is an armless, legless cyborg phocomelus artist who has been commissioned to paint a mural of Lufteufel, though nobody knows where Lufteufel lives, or what he looks like. The Servants of Wrath leadership ask McMasters to find Lufteufel and paint his mural. En route, we learn about the absence of national communications systems after the widespread destruction caused by nuclear warfare. McMasters and other seekers encounter mutant lizards, birds and insects who have evolved sentience, as well as the \\"Big C\\", a decaying artificial intelligence that also survived the war; it survives by consuming humans for their trace elements. While trying to remove shrapnel from his forehead, Lufteufel loses consciousness from loss of blood, at which point his intellectually challenged \\"daughter\\", Alice, tries to remove some of the blood using a shirt. This leaves a bloody imprint on the fabric. Alice keeps the shirt because it is the only remaining likeness of his face, leaving her with the only true relic of the God of Wrath, evoking the Christian legend of the veil of Veronica and the artifact known as the Shroud of Turin. Going under the name ‚ÄúJack Schuld‚Äù (German for \\"guilt\\"), Lufteufel kills a dog belonging to McMasters, and McMasters murders Lufteufel without realising his identity. After his death, Alice is visited by Lufteufel's \\"spirit\\" . He does not speak, but he helps Alice by \\"lifting the fog in her brain\\", removing her disability. She sees that his spirit is finally at peace. Alice is not the only human to experience a theophany related to Lufteufel's passing. Another survivor has a vision of a \\"Palm Tree Garden\\" equivalent to the Garden of Eden. This implies that Lufteufel may have been a gnostic demiurge, an evil earthbound deity who believes itself omnipotent, but whose abilities are constricted compared to \\"higher levels\\" of divinity. However, McMasters has no knowledge of Lufteufel's death or of the alleged visions related to his death. He is tricked by his (Christian) companion Pete into using an elderly dying alcoholic vagrant for the likeness of Lufteufel for the commissioned church mural, which is prominently featured in leading Servants of Wrath institutions. The mural's survival is a tacit argument that religious belief is often based on mythological accretions, which may not be valid interpretations of decisive events in the history of that faith.

They allow the new dentist to further hone his or her skills in most of the traditionally defined disciplines of dentistry while at the same time increasing one's speed and refining one's techniques. These programs also afford trainees the opportunity to learn from the attending dentists who serve a supervisory role, something generally unavailable in private practice. While a GPR is a hospital-based program, an AEGD is usually not and the differences between the two types of programs are generally a result of this distinction.What is the difference between a GPR and an AEGD? Both types of programs afford the trainee with a larger patient pool than he or she was exposed to in dental school; while dental students will typically treat 2 or 3 patients a day in multiple-hour-long sessions, these postgraduate programs are constructed so that trainees may see anywhere from 8-15 patients a day, or even more. Programs will often emphasize the importance of managing comprehensive dental treatment plans and adjusting them based on the patient's medical condition. During training, residents may be faced with the task of managing patients that require dentistry in a hospital setting due to a compromised medical condition. Medical management of dental patients may be emphasized in weekly grand rounds and rotations through anesthesia, internal medicine, and the hospital emergency department. Some programs also provide rotations in family medicine and otolarnyology. These rotations not only increase the trainee's knowledge and experience, but also allows physicians, resident or attending, to see how dentistry and medicine are related, allowing for a better referral relationship in future practices. This relationship is best demonstrated in tumor boards where both medical and dental residents discuss and treatment plan head and neck cancer patients. In general, GPR programs pay higher stipends than do AEGD programs; this is because GPR residents take call and answer consults. While on call, the residents are expected to manage head and neck trauma reporting to the ER in accordance with hospital guidelines. GPR residents may also become familiar with performing dental/oral surgical procedures in the operating room and managing the patient's stay while in the hospital. Rotation through the dental specialties increases the resident's ability to handle situations in private practice without referral to a specialist. In both programs, the basic skills learned in dental school are improved significantly, preparing the dentist for a career in private practice or for a specialty residency program. Residents may work closely with oral and maxillofacial surgeons, allowing them to improve their skills in oral surgical procedures. Under the direct supervision of the oral surgeons, residents may expand their understanding of and increase their skill in third molar extraction, biopsy technique, pathology recognition and treatment planning in facial cosmetic and trauma surgery. Both types of programs will usually feature lecture series to further develop the knowledge that trainees received from their respective dental schools. Application process Applications are generally filled out at the beginning of the senior year of dental school. As with most specialty programs, GPR and AEGD programs utilize the Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS) operated and managed by the American Dental Education Association (ADEA). The PASS system allows all applicants to fill out a single form that is then efficiently distributed to the programs selected by the applicant. Similarly, single copies of secondary application material, such as letters of recommendation, National Board scores and the like, can be sent to PASS, which then certifies the authenticity of the copied versions it distributes to the selected programs. Overall, it allows for a more streamlined process of application over most any alternative method.The ADEA PASS website After applications are in, programs will usually contact prospective candidates for interviews. After interviews are complete, the programs and the candidates will utilize the Postdoctoral Dental Matching Program, abbreviated as \\"the Match,\\" to rank each other in order of preference. After the due date, a computerized algorithm sets up each candidate with the program that he or she ranked highest, although this explanation is oversimplified. For those candidates who do not match at any program, there is a \\"post-match\\" period during which programs which maintain open spots attempt to fill them on a case-by-case basis with candidates who did not match to a program. State licensure Some states require a postgraduate training program to meet requirements for licensure. For example, as of January 1, 2007, New York State requires that new dentists complete either a GPR, an AEGD or a specialty residency prior to receiving their dental license.

Ottawa. crimsoneyed rosemallow,Hibiscus moscheutos. USDA PLANTS. or eastern rosemallow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a cold-hardy perennial wetland plant that can grow in large colonies. The hirsute leaves are of variable morphology, but are commonly deltoidal in shape with up to three lobes. It is found in wetlands and along the riverine systems of the eastern United States from Texas to the Atlantic states, its territory extending northward to southern Ontario. There exist in nature numerous forms, and petal colors range from pure white to deep rose, and most have an eye of deep maroon. Taxonomic consensus is lacking for the nomenclature of the multiple subspecies. The flowers are borne apically, whereas the related Hibiscus laevis carries bud and bloom along the stem. Ecology It is a larval host for the common checkered skipper, the gray hairstreak, the Io moth, and the pearly wood nymph.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Cultivation This is a popular garden plant. It can be propagated by seed, or by crown divisions during winter dormancy, and some success can be achieved by hard-wood stem cuttings. Numerous hybrids of the native North American Hibiscus species have been released by the commercial nursery trade. In cultivation the species or the hybrids can be used in bog gardens or other water features. They are attractive and have wildlife value for nectar-feeders and birds. Cultivars Corolla Many cold-hardy hibiscus cultivars are hybrids of H. moscheutos, H. palustris, H. coccineus, H. laevis, H. militaris, H. grandiflorus, H. dasycalyx, H. mutabilis. With indeterminate genetic contributions from each parent species.Winters, H. F. (1970). Our hardy Hibiscus species as ornamentals. Economic Botany 24(2) 155-64. Hibiscus breeders do not preclude the possibility of self-pollination. However, recent research has shown that artificial pollination just after the flower has opened using a high pollen load will ensure that most of the resulting seeds are from the selected pollen parent. Early hibiscus breeders were likely aware of this and used it to their advantage.Snow, A. A., et al. (2000).

Scribner's Magazine was the second magazine out of the Scribner's firm, after the publication of Scribner's Monthly. Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 setting up the magazine, to compete with the already successful Harper's Monthly and The Atlantic Monthly. Scribner's Magazine was launched in 1887, and was the first of any magazine to introduce color illustrations. The magazine ceased publication in 1939. The magazine contained many engravings by famous artists of the 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as many famous authors of that time, including John Thomason, Elisabeth Woodbridge Morris and Clarence Cook, as well as President Theodore Roosevelt. The magazine had high sales when Roosevelt started contributing, reaching over 200,000, but gradually lost circulation after World War I. History The first issue of Scribner's Monthly. Scribner's Magazine was the second periodical publication of the Scribner's firm, after Scribner's Monthly was published from 1870 to 1881. Scribner's Monthly was later moved to another publisher, and renamed The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Charles Scribner announced to a New York Times reporter that they would make a new monthly publication \\"as soon as the necessary arrangements could be perfected\\". It was also announced that the editor would be Edward Burlingame, the son of Anson Burlingame, who was already connected to the publishing house as literary adviser. Charles Scribner also noted that the magazine would not be a revival of the formerly published Scribner's Monthly. Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 in launching Scribner's Magazine to complete with the already successful pictorials, The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Burlingame hired the best artists in his country for the magazine; Howard Pyle, Howard Chandler Christy, Charles Marion Russell, Walter Everett, Maxfield Parrish and Frederic Remington. Before the first issue was released, Charles Scribner's Sons had their first annual \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" dinner at their main offices. Scribner's Magazine was launched in January 1887, the first issue of which was to be published from January to June of that year. The magazine was printed and bound by Trow's Printing and Bookbinding Company. Scribner's Magazine was also the first magazine to introduce color illustrations later on. The first issue opens with the literary article \\"The Downfall to the Empire.\\" by E.B. Washburne, the former minister to France. An early morning fire in 1908 at the Charles Scribner's Sons offices heavily burned the third and fourth floors, where the magazine was produced. In May 1914, the magazine's editor, Edward L. Burlingame, retired and Robert Bridges took over as editor. (Bridges was a lifelong close friend of President Woodrow Wilson ever since the two had met as students at Princeton University.) During the First World War, the magazine employed authors, Richard Harding Davis, Edith Wharton and John Galsworthy, to write about the major conflict. During the time of 1917, when the United States joined the war, the magazine had four to six articles on the subject. On the date of November 19, 1922, the first editor of the magazine, Edward L. Burlingame, died. In January 1928 the magazine had a change in format, with the first of the newly formatted issue having a cover design by Rockwell Kent. The June 1929 issue was banned in Boston, Massachusetts, due to the article A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway. The article was deemed salacious by the public, and Boston police barred the magazine from book stands. Charles Scribner's Sons issued the statement that: Wounded soldier reader of Scribner's Magazine donated by the American Library Association in 1919 In 1930 the magazine's editor, Robert Bridges, retired to become a literary adviser for the firm, and associate editor Alfred S. Deshiell became the \\"managing editor\\" of Scribner's Magazine. By January 1932, the magazine had a second change in format, making it much larger. In October 1936, Harlan D. Logan took over as editor from Alfred S. Dashiell, who went on to edit Reader's Digest. Yet again, in October 1936, the magazine went through a third change of design. In 1938, the magazine was bought from Charles Scribner's Sons and started to be published by Harlan Logan Associates, who still retained an interest. In May 1939, the magazine ceased publication due to low circulation compared to Harper's Monthly and The Atlantic Monthly. The magazine was then merged with the pictorial Commentator, to become Scribner's Commentator in November 1939. Scribner's Commentator also ceased publication in 1942 after one of the magazine's staff pleaded guilty to taking payoffs from the Japanese government, in return for publishing propaganda promoting United States isolationism. Contributors The magazine was distinguished both by its images, which focused on engravings, and later color images by artists such as Leo Hershfield, Howard Christy, Walter Everett, Mary Hallock Foote, Maxfield Parrish, Ernest Peixotto, Howard Pyle, Frederic Remington, and Charles Marion Russell. The magazine was also noted for its articles, including work by Jacob Riis such as How the Other Half Lives, and The Poor in Great Cities, as well as Theodore Roosevelt's African Game Trails, John Thomason, Elisabeth Woodbridge Morris and Clarence Cook. Reception Scribner's Magazine sold well until its conclusion in 1939. The circulation of the magazine went up when Theodore Roosevelt started authoring a section of the magazine. Around the time, circulation numbers went up to 215,000. The magazine had strong sales until the end of the First World War, then sales went down to 70,000 and then 43,000 by 1930, which eventually brought the magazine to a closure. Review of Reviews editor, William T. Stead, criticized the magazine for relying too much on its illustrations.

It is down the line from on the Hertford Loop Line between Hertford North and Stevenage and is served by trains operated by Great Northern.  History  According to the Watton-at-Stone Parish Council,Watton-at-Stone Parish Council: Transport a proposal for a rail route between London and Stevenage was approved by Parliament in 1898, though construction did not begin until 1906. A single-track section through Watton- at-Stone opened on 4 March 1918, with the track later being dualled. The station saw its first passenger train run through on 6 February 1920, but did so only when a train was diverted from the East Coast Main Line as the result of an accident. Scheduled passenger services of four trains per day started on 2 June 1924, stopping on request at Watton-at-Stone. The station's life as a passenger service was short-lived however, and it closed just 15 years later on 10 September 1939, despite the famed locomotive engineer Nigel Gresley's residency in the village. The nationalised British Railways considered reopening the station in the 1960s, but it was not until 1981 that a campaign to reopen the station gathered momentum. The bulk of the ¬£120,000 costs were paid for by Hertfordshire County Council and British Rail, but villagers and the parish council responded to a public appeal for funds, and together contributed ¬£8,000. On 17 May 1982, a small crowd gathered to board the 06:23 service from Watton-at-Stone to Moorgate, the first passenger train to serve the village in almost 43 years. Services Prior to the May 2019 timetable change, the station was served by two trains per hour towards Moorgate and 1 tph to Stevenage; however during peak times this increases up to three trains an hour in each direction. Southbound trains for London run to Moorgate, whilst northbound trains generally terminate at the next stop on the line, , apart from selected weekday trains which continue to Hitchin before terminating at Letchworth Garden City. Since then, Great Northern has stopped running through to Stevenage and beyond on weekdays whilst upgrade works (to add an additional running line and terminal platform) are carried out at Stevenage station. An hourly replacement bus is in operation until the work is completed in spring 2020.\\"From 20 May 2019 buses replace trains from Monday- Friday between Stevenage and Watton-at-Stone\\"Great Northern website news article; Retrieved 24 July 2019 An hourly train service continues to operate over this section at weekends. The twice-hourly service to Hertford North and Moorgate continues as normal on weekdays.  The Finishing Line  In 1977, track in the vicinity of the then closed station was used by British Transport Films as a set to film the notorious public information film The Finishing Line.British Transport Films: The Finishing Line Using shock tactics to deter children from playing near railway lines, the film was staged as a dream sequence of a parody school sports day with 'events' on and around the track. Local schoolchildren were drafted as actors. The film was broadcast on the nightly Nationwide TV show, and the liberal quantities of stage blood and graphic depiction of injuries became a matter of some controversy.

It was an accepted diagnosis in Europe and America through the second half of the 19th century. The physician James Cowles Prichard first used the phrase to describe a mental disorder in 1835 in his Treatise on insanity and other disorders affecting the mind.James Cowles Prichard (1837) A Treatise on Insanity and Other Disorders Affecting the Mind, Carey & Hart, Philadelphia He defined moral insanity as: \\"madness consisting in a morbid perversion of the natural feelings, affections, inclinations, temper, habits, moral dispositions, and natural impulses, without any remarkable disorder or defect of the interest or knowing and reasoning faculties, and particularly without any insane illusion or hallucinations.\\"Quoted in: The concept of moral insanity was indebted to the work of physician Philippe Pinel, which was acknowledged by Prichard. Pinel had described mental diseases of only partial, affective, insanity. His concept Manie sans d√©lire (Latin - mania sine delirio; French - folie raisonnante or folie lucide raisonnante, monomanie affective; German - Moralisches IrreseinTuke, Daniel Hack (ed.) (1892). A Dictionary of Psychological Medicine. Volume 2. J. & A. Churchill. p. 813.) referred to insanity without delusion. That is, the sufferer was thought to be mad in one area only and thus the personality of the individual might be distorted but his or her intellectual faculties were unimpaired. The term 'moral', at that time and taken originally from French, could mean emotional rather than necessarily referring to ethics. Diagnostic schemes The term 'moral insanity' had been used earlier by Thomas Arnold (physician) and Benjamin Rush in referring to what they saw as a result of madness ‚Äì a disruption or perversion of the emotions or moral sense. This usage had little to do with Prichard's diagnostic definition of the term as a form of madness itself, however. Overall, Prichard defined insanity as a, \\"chronic disease, manifested by deviations from the healthy and natural state of the mind.\\" He then proposed four broad categories. Moral insanity was for disorders that only seemed to arise from a person's feelings and habits, not his intellect. The other three types involved increasing degrees of intellectual abnormality: a partial derangement that was limited to certain trains of thought; a full mania, by which was meant 'raving madness' regardless of topic; and lastly, a breakdown of any connections between ideas, referred to as incoherence or dementia. Prichard considered that some early nosologists, namely Sauvages, Sagar and Linnaeus, had distinguished between medical conditions with hallucinations and those involving depraved appetites or feelings. But he credits Pinel as the first in psychiatry to clearly distinguish madness without delerium, in opposition to Locke's widely accepted axiom that insanity always stemmed from faulty intellectual connections or mistaken perceptions. However, Pinel's concept focused on a frenzy of the passions, particularly involving rage and violence. For Prichard the typical syndrome was more a form of extreme eccentricity, and he would later refer to Pinel's type as a madness of the instincts. Prichard was an adherent of what was known faculty psychology, which attempted to divide the mind into different functions or abilities, but not phrenology, which attempted to locate them below specific parts of the skull. He was also influenced by a school of thought associated with the physician Nasse, which posited disorders of emotions or temperament rather than intellect. Prichard also considered a complex categorical scheme developed by Heinroth, concluding that a number of disorders in different divisions of that scheme would be more simply gathered under the heading 'moral insanity'. He suggested the category could also be termed 'parapathia', or alternatively 'pathomania' by analogy with monomania. The latter term had been introduced by the physician Esquirol, who had succeeded Pinel, to refer to a form of insanity where there is a fixation or excess in only one area. It was also used widely by √âtienne-Jean Georget. It was theorized to be caused by a split in the faculties of the mind. Prichard considered his first category of intellectual (rather than moral) insanity, to be equivalent to monomania. This in turn meant that the symptoms of moral insanity could increase, causing an overall degeneration into monomania. \\"On the surface, monomania can thus appear even more circumscribed a form of derangement than moral insanity.\\" However, Esquirol by contrast considered moral insanity to be simply one form of monomania. Context Contemporary misunderstanding of the term derives from the double meaning of the word \\"moral\\" in the nineteenth century context. According to Erdmann Mueller in a comprehensive 1899 treatise on moral insanity: \\"the word moral in the concept moral insanity is derived from the word affective in Esquirol's terminology, and the translation of moral as virtuous or ethical is the result of a misunderstanding due to the double meaning of the word.\\"Quoted in According to Pinel, manie sans d√©lire (mania without delusion) had no relation to the moral faculty. Moral insanity was a form of mental derangement in which the intellectual faculties were unaffected, but the affects or emotions were damaged, causing patients to be carried away by some kind of furious instinct (instincte fureur). Likewise, the term moral treatment referred to a set of psychosocial techniques rather than necessarily defined as ethical practice. Under Pinel's guidance, patients were freed from chains and shackles. Prichard used a mixture of moral treatment techniques as well as traditional medical treatments of bleeding, purging, vomiting etc. Prichard appeared to view the disorder in terms of both affect and morality. As a religious and conservative man, he shared in some gloom about a perceived decline in morals and religion, and increase of selfishness. Some attributed this to socioeconomic developments related to industrialization or capitalism. Prichard saw it as an issue within human consciousness, identity and judgement; he was also influenced by theories that natural human emotions could become unbalanced in conditions of civilisation far removed from nature. However, he also linked moral insanity to a debasement of the more refined emotions, which he in turn saw as more associated with the affluent classes, such that a person still knew right from wrong but became unable to conduct themselves \\"with decency and propriety in the business of life\\". Prichard was also concerned to challenge the development of phrenology, which attempted to localise aspects of the mind and personality to particular areas of the brain, as assessed by the size of bumps in the skull. The alternative was to locate mental disorder in temperament, abstractly located in the visceral organs or nervous system in a then modern form of humorism, while maintaining that powers of judgement were a metaphysical or religious component. Later, Maudsley discussed moral insanity as a sign of poor moral willpower or moral sense. DH Tuke asserted that while it may appear to stem from the emotions, it was often due to a weakening of the 'higher centres' of will, and he thus suggested a new name 'inhibitory insanity'. Both moral insanity and monomania were depicted in Victorian novels and movies of the time. They were similar in that they were both abnormalities of an otherwise normal mind, though the former was a systemic malfunction and the latter an isolated aberration. The context leading to the conceptualization of this diagnostic category was undoubtedly borne out of the frustration of alienists (the term is approximately equivalent to the modern day one of psychiatrist) by the definition of madness provided by John Locke in which delusional symptoms were required. In legal trials this definition had proved to be a great source of embarrassment to alienists because unless delusional symptoms could be clearly shown judges would not consider a plea of insanity. In terms of involuntary commitment of individuals alleged to be insane, Prichard was cautious in using the diagnosis of moral insanity, partly because the educated classes that were typical clients tended to hold the asylum system in very low regard. Prichard tended to suggest it came down to an assessment of individual mental state and ability. He emphasized property and social order as the rationale for confinement: \\"Of all these arrangements the maintenance of public order is the principal object, and the second is the preservation of the property belonging to the lunatic and the interest of his family.\\" Implications Ultimately, the concept of moral insanity did not change the orthodox legal defense of insanity which required the clear presence of delusion, as embodied in the M'Naghten rules in 1842 which are still referenced today. Nevertheless, modern conceptions of responsibility have been forged in part through the medical and legal exchanges over moral insanity, including anticipations of the diagnosis in the writings of Benjamin Rush, in the context of concepts of free will associated with religious Common Sense Realism.Blumental, S.L. The Mind of a Moral Agent: Scottish Common Sense and the Problem of Responsibility in Nineteenth-Century American Law Law and History Review, 2008 Moral insanity came to be increasingly seen as a form of genetically-inherited degeneracy, and toward the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century converged with ideas of moral imbecility and deficiency, as well as with an anti-vice moral hygiene movement.Rimke, H. & Hunt, A From sinners to degenerates: the medicalization of morality in the 19th century History of the Human Sciences February 2002 vol. 15 no. 1 59-88 Several writers have sounded caution over the notion that the diagnostic category of moral insanity was a direct forerunner of psychopathic disorder. As stated by the historian F.A. Whitlock: \\"there [is] not the remotest resemblance between their examples [Pinel's and Prichard's] and what today would be classed as psychopathic personality.\\" Prichard's \\"moral insanity\\" was a catch-all term of behavioural disorders whose only feature in common was an absence of delusions: it is not cognate with the modern diagnostic category of antisocial personality disorder.Berrios, German E. (1996). The History of Mental Symptoms: Descriptive Psychopathology Since the Nineteenth Century. Cambridge: p. 427. However, Whitlock has suggested that the diagnosis gradually changed into moral imbecility over the turn of the century and that in turn transformed into something like the current concept of psychopathy. The psychiatrist Koch sought to make the moral insanity concept more scientific and suggested in 1891 the phrase 'psychopathic inferiority' (later personality) be used instead. This referred to continual and rigid patterns of misconduct or dysfunction in the absence of apparent mental retardation or illness. The diagnosis was meant to imply a congenital disorder, and to be made without moral judgement, though Koch has been described as deeply rooted in a Christian faith. Toward the mid 20th century the terminology of the 'psychopathic' would become specifically associated with an aggressive and anti-social personality. A more general concept of character disorders came into use by psychoanalysts, and psychiatry later adopted the current terminology of personality disorders.

It is a member of the European Humanist Federation and Humanists International. History and aims The Humanist Society of Scotland was formed in 1989 out of an association of local humanist groups around Scotland, the Society's objective is \\"to represent the views of people in Scotland who wish to lead good and worthwhile lives guided by reason and compassion rather than religion or superstition\\", and to provide a distinct Scottish voice in complement to the British Humanist Association. In 2018, the Society reported having over 15,000 members. The Society also claims to have a representative role for the 28% of Scots (at the 2001 census) who identify themselves as having no religion. The Society believes that the wording of the census question tends to inflate the numbers of people identifying themselves as religious who were brought up in a tradition of religious belief but who either no longer believe or who have significant doubts. The Society has campaigned to persuade the Registrar General to amend the question for the 2011 census. The official symbol of the Society is an adaptation of the Happy Human symbol which incorporates the Saltire. The author Christopher Brookmyre previously held the post of President between 2008 and 2015. Campaigns The Society campaigns for a secular state in Scotland, and to abolish religious privilege. Its main efforts have concentrated on seeking to allow legal humanist weddings, which succeeded in 2005, and to secularise state education. Weddings In January 2001, the Society lodged a petition with the Scottish Parliament calling for the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 to be amended to allow legal humanist wedding ceremonies, alongside religious and civil ones.Petition to the Scottish Parliament to End Discrimination in the Marriage Law of Scotland Although the Act was not amended, section 12 of the Act allows the Registrar General for Scotland to authorise temporary additional celebrants.Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 (c.15) In 2005, the Registrar agreed to authorise 12 celebrants from the Humanist Society, in part because of a concern that allowing legal religious weddings but not legal humanist ones might not be consistent with the right to \\"freedom of thought, conscience and religion\\", which includes non-religious belief, in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The first legal humanist wedding took place at Edinburgh Zoo on 18 June 2005 between Karen Watts (from Ireland) and Martin Reijns (from the Netherlands). Humanist weddings have since becoming increasingly popular and, in 2010, with over 70 celebrants authorised to conduct them 2,092 legal humanist weddings took place in Scotland, becoming the third most popular form of Wedding in Scotland after Registrars and the Church of Scotland. The Society organises training, mentoring and performance reviews of celebrants, and submits names of celebrants to the Registrar General annually for authorisation. Prior to the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, the Society performed a similar role for celebrants to conduct same-sex commitment ceremonies and weddings, although formal authorisation by the Registrar is not required for these ceremonies since they had no effect on the legal status of individuals concerned. Since the legalisation of same-sex marriages, both sets of same-sex and opposite-sex marriages are treated the same way. In 2017 the society received official status from the Scottish Parliament as the first non- religious body that could solemnise weddings. Scotland was from 2005 until 2018 the only part of the United Kingdom where humanist celebrants can solemnise marriages (Northern Ireland became the second in 2018 following a Humanists UK legal case). In 2017, the Society announced that it had married 50,000 people in legal ceremonies since their recognition in 2005. In 2017, the Society conducted more weddings than the Church of Scotland or the Scottish Catholic Church, prompting media discussions about the high profile of humanism in Scotland. In 2018 official statistics obtained by BBC Radio 4 from the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service showed that those who opted for a Humanist wedding were three time less likely to end in divorce than a Roman Catholic marriage and four times less likely to end in divorce than a civil marriage. Education In 2013 the group, along with the Edinburgh Secular Society, started a campaign against religious representation on council education committees in Scotland. In 2016 the Society took a judicial review of the decision to not allow children and young people to opt out of compulsory religious observance in Scottish schools, after a UN Committee called for a change in practice in Scotland. Other issues The Society supported both the End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill, introduced in the Scottish Parliament by Margo MacDonald MSP,End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill, Humanist Society Scotland website.. They were also part of the campaign for equal marriage in Scotland to allow same sex couples to be legally married as an alternative to civil partnerships as well as allowing opposite sex couples access to civil partnerships. Humanist Society Scotland have also campaigned to remove Blasphemy from Scots law and to end funding for homeopathy on the NHS in Scotland.

Operating as a concessionaire of the National Park Service, the company operated from a base in Cedar City, Utah. The company's bus tours connected there with Union Pacific trains as well as tour buses from Los Angeles, San Francisco and other west coast cities, and offered a loop tour of the region's parks and monuments, escorted by a Utah Parks Company driver/guide. History Shortly after the National Park Service was created through the 1916 Organic Act, the brothers Gronway and Chauncey Perry applied for a transportation concession to take tourists from Cedar City to Mukuntuweap National Monument (later Zion National Park), incorporating as the National Park Transportation and Camping Company with William Wylie in 1917. The Parry brothers had previously operated a shuttle service from the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad to St. George, Utah which started in 1915; the new transportation concession operated with a fleet of used vehicles: one seven-passenger Hudson, a Ford Model T, and three Cadillacs. The shoestring operation was run entirely by the two brothers, who were often so busy running the company they enlisted their younger brother, Whit, to drive tourists when he was just 13 years old. When the United States entered World War I, the two older brothers joined the Army and turned over their proxies in the company to Wylie; upon their return in 1920, they discovered that Wylie had forced them out. After a court battle, Chauncey Perry and Wylie reconciled and restarted the company in 1921, now renamed to the Utah‚ÄîGrand Canyon Transportation Company since they now provided trips to the Grand Canyon as well. After Wylie left the company, Chauncey invited Gronway to rejoin and Chauncey served as a guide during President Warren Harding's trip to Zion in 1923. Union Pacific acquired the Los Angeles & Salt Lake in 1921 and extended a branch of the line from Lund to Cedar City in 1923, incorporating its Utah Parks Company subsidiary that year; the railroad- backed company bought out the Parry brothers in 1926 and installed them as company superintendents. The typical route to Zion from the southwest was a dead-end at the time; tourists going in were forced to take the same way out until the Zion ‚Äì Mount Carmel Highway and Tunnel was completed in 1930. The tunnel was not initiated until it was apparent that Bryce Canyon would be added to the National Park System. After it was completed, the Utah Parks Company set up the \\"Grand Loop Tour\\" for tourists taking buses through Zion, Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Cedar Breaks; the tunnel cut travel time to Bryce Canyon by half and reduced the distance from . After 1936, bus tours were offered on the National Parks-standard White Model 706. As the twentieth century progressed, railroad passenger traffic declined and the Union Pacific's interest in supporting National Park tourism correspondingly lessened. The railroad ended passenger train service to Cedar City in 1960, and in 1972 the Union Pacific donated its concession-related infrastructure to the National Park Service. The facilities at Cedar Breaks were razed, as were some of the developments at Bryce and Zion, but the remaining lodge facilities remain in use today. In March 2007, Xanterra Parks and Resorts took over the concession at the former Utah Parks Company locations. In March 2014, the concession inside Bryce Canyon National Park was taken over by Forever Resorts. Properties The Utah Parks Company constructed rustic-style, stone-and-log lodges at each of the Park Service locations it served. Most of the major buildings were designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, a noted period architect. (Underwood also designed the Ahwahnee Hotel (1925) in Yosemite National Park, and Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park.) Underwood's surviving Utah Parks Company buildings are considered exceptional examples of the Rustic style of architecture, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The company also owned the landmark El Escalante Hotel in Cedar City where visitors intending to take the park loop on a Utah Parks Company bus were required to stay their first night in Cedar City, which became known as the \\"Gateway to the Parks\\". The venerable El Escalante was especially well known to escorts in the 1960s, many from Greyhound Bus Lines, arriving via bus for a tour of the Parks. With up to 39 travelers per tour, the groups took over the El Escalante, which offered only 23 rooms, and some were forced to share bathrooms. It was a common joke among escorts that if you could survive that first night at the El Escalante with a full tour, you could survive most anything.

The Today review noted how A Far Cry From Here \\"revels in a sense of unease and is the most obvious sign yet of the band's move away from its past 'ambient candy' sound\\". Yeow Kai Chai of The Straits Times praised The Observatory for \\"delving deep and venturing into the unknown...This sense of unease, a constant calibration between heaviness and lightness, informs the way the music switches between jazzy delicacy and far- out phases of post-rock noiseniks. It's both the beauty and the beast... it's a ghostly, raw, sometimes intense soundscape with minimal overdubs to frighten off lazy lounge cats.\\"Yeow Kai Chai (6 April 2007). \\"Seeking out Soul\\". The Straits Times. Page 94. Retrieved 18 August 2014. As with previous releases, the band chose a non-standard packaging instead of the conventional jewel case. The outer package is a small box with flap, containing a foldout multipanel slipcover with information, and a CD holder in the last section. A Far Cry From Here was launched on 14 April 2007 at Zouk. =Dark Folke= * Released: July 2009 * Produced by J√∏rgen Tr√¶en and The Observatory * Recorded, Mixed & mastered by J√∏rgen Tr√¶en at Duper Studio (Bergen, Norway) The fourth album was again recorded and mixed in Bergen, Norway with their longtime collaborator, Jorgen Traeen. The band describes the work as \\"a change in musical direction\\" and said \\"the math prog rock of The Observatory's third album A Far Cry From Here has morphed into a fluid mystical beast called Dark Folke. Most songs have no drums on them. But there is rhythm. Only the type of rhythm associated with an invisible pulse. An implied rhythm. 5 folks sitting around a fire. A metaphorical fire. Chanting for the rain to come.\\" \\"Moving away from the melodious constraints of song,\\" Ang Song Ming writes in his review, \\"Dark Folke veers towards ambience ‚Äì an almost asphyxiating kind\\", calling it the band's Kid A. Noah Berlatsky remarked in Metro Pulse on the album's combination of freak folk, drony psychedelia and near-metal. Christopher Lim of The Business Times called Dark Folke \\"A rich sonic feast.. a diving pool that begs to have its depths plumbed\\",Lim, Christopher (3 July 2009). \\"Singapore's music past and present\\". The Business Times. Page 29. Retrieved 18 August 2014. while Christopher Toh of Today awarded the album 4 out of 5, writing that \\"Album No 4 for The Observatory is a great excursion into what making music in Scandinavia in the wintertime sounds like...the album is wonderfully hypnotic.\\" The CD album is a hardbound book, designed and drawn by metal/hardcore/underground illustrator and designer, Justin Bartlett, the artist behind the art of Sunn O))), Moss, Aura Noir and more. Dark Folke was also released on double vinyl. A music video for \\"Mind Roots\\", directed by Ler Jiyuan, was also released. In the lead-up to the release of Dark Folke, The Observatory collaborated with filmmaker Ho Tzu Nyen and theatre director Kok Heng Leun on Invisible Room, a multimedia work for the Singapore Arts Festival featuring the band performing in an 'inverted' music space. \\"Invisible Room\\" is also the title of a Dark Folke song. =Catacombs= * Released: April 2012 * Produced by J√∏rgen Tr√¶en and The Observatory * Recorded and Mixed by Jorgen Traeen * Mastered by James Plotkin * Design by Keith Utech * Art by Thomas Hooper * Offset, Letterpress Printing and Bindery by Stumptown Printers The Observatory's fifth album, Catacombs, is described by the band as containing \\"a more primal, new dark wave sound...[a] study in delusion, insanity and obsession [that] provokes and inspires in a deeply enigmatic way. Even at its coldest and most abstract, it is human to the core.\\" Writing that \\"The Observatory have outdone themselves this time\\", X' Ho reviewed Catacombs by declaring, \\"Someday in the future, some pop historian is gonna look back and say ‚Äì Catacombs marks the beginning of a new horizon in local music for the sheer fact that waywardness in Singapore's ultra-leftfield, alternative- rock has been deemed fetching and unanimously praised with this album.\\" Critic Kevin Mathews praised Catacombs by calling it \\"an uncompromising honest work of art that expresses the deepest feelings and emotions of the artist and lays them bare for its audience to dissect, absorb and devour.\\" my Paper described Catacombs as \\"dark, visceral and multi-faceted\\", promising that it will \\"get under your skin ‚Äì and stay there.\\" Yeow Kai Chai of The Straits Times awarded the album four out of five stars, comparing it to late Scott Walker and noting lyricist Leslie Low's references to Dutch occultist Johann Weyer and French philosopher Michel Foucault, writing that \\"the band have moved out of the mainstream into the furthest frontiers of the universe.\\"Yeow Kai Chai (27 April 2012). \\"Wormy Goodness\\". The Straits Times. Page D6. Retrieved 19 August 2014. Alia Azmi of Juice magazine noted that the album \\"explores a deeper, heavier sound than their previous works\\". In 2017, music website Bandwagon ranked Catacombs as the best The Observatory album, writing that \\"it stands as the band‚Äôs crowning achievement in framing primal emotions within intricate instrumentation...an incredible singular statement of artful intention and uninhibited honesty\\". Featuring design by Keith Utech and art by Thomas Hooper, Catacombs was released on deluxe CD, digital and double vinyl. Catacombs was launched on 20 and 21 April 2012 at The Substation Theatre. Enter the Catacomb, a series of live sessions featuring the band performing Catacombs in its entirety in the studio, was also released. =Oscilla= * Released: August 2014 * Music composed and performed by The Observatory * Cheryl Ong - Drums, Percussion; Dharma - Guitar; Leslie Low - Guitar, Vocal; Vivian Wang - Synth Bass, Keys, Percussion; Yuen Chee Wai - Electronics, Synth * Lyrics by Leslie Low * Produced by The Observatory * Recorded live at The Black Axis, Singapore, May 2014 * Engineered by Johnny Sarcophagus * Mixed by Leslie Low * Mastered by James Plotkin * Concept & direction by The Observatory * Photos from \\"On the blue shores of silence\\" by Philipp Aldrup * Typography, layout and additional photography by Yuen Chee Wai The Observatory's sixth album, Oscilla, is described by the band as \\"the imagined swing of our imperfect times\\", featuring \\"vibrations of shifting rhythms, synth bass space, oscillators and abused guitars\\". The four songs on Oscilla were developed on a tour with Norwegian noise band MoE in Norway in 2012 and Italy in 2013, then tested on the road during a Southeast Asian tour in October and November 2013, culminating in a divisive performance at St. Jerome's Laneway Festival in Singapore. The lyrics deal with political tumult and according to the band's lyricist Leslie Low, reflect \\"[c]ommon people like us making a stand. Living off the grid in some way or another, (offering) criticism of existing paradigms, alternatives, the view from the ground up\\". The title track makes reference to Zomia, historian Willem van Schendel and James C. Scott's term for the huge mass of mainland Southeast Asia that has historically been beyond the control of governments based in the population centres of the lowlands. Reviewing the album in Today, Kevin Mathews writes, \\"Oscilla is cutting-edge art that one can conceivably rock out to, which is no mean feat\\", awarding it full marks. Yeow Kai Chai gave the album four out of five stars, writing in The Straits Times that Oscilla \\"scans the deplorable state of the world, questions war and strife, and assesses the value of life. To that end, its restless, angular riffs cut and draw blood.\\" Daniel Peters of Bandwagon observed the \\"politically-charged\\" dimension of Oscilla, writing that the \\"elongated hypnotic rhythms akin to krautrock and a harsh post-punk intensity...establishes Oscilla as one of the most confrontational records we've heard all year.\\" Featuring photographs by Philipp Aldrup, Oscilla was released on CD, digital, vinyl and cassette. Oscilla was launched on 16 and 17 August 2014 at The Substation Theatre, featuring appearances by Hanging Up the Moon's Sean Lam, Dean Aziz and former member Victor Low on back-up vocals. =Continuum= * Released: 15 July 2015 * Performed by Dharma - guitar, bass; Bani Haykal - guitar, reyong, cengceng; Vivian Wang - synth, voice; Leslie Low - Acoustic guitar, bass, drums, voice, pemade, jegogan, reyong * Concept & direction by The Observatory * Recorded & mixed by Leslie Low * Mastered by James Plotkin * Illustration by Massimiliano Amati (Redellearinghe) * Album design by Yuen Chee Wai Four years in the making, The Observatory's seventh album, Continuum, is their take on Indonesia's gamelan music tradition. Partially written and recorded in Lodtunduh, Bali, Continuum found The Observatory devising their own six-note scale of E, F, F#, A#, C and D#. Inspired in part by Talk Talk and Jiddu Krishnamurti, Continuum had the noise musician Lasse Marhaug contributing a remix, \\"Part 6\\", to its release. Released on double vinyl, CD and digitally, Continuum was launched at The Substation on 23 July 2015 at a launch concert with an ensemble of 10 musicians, with The Straits Times finding \\"the East-meets-West soundscape...hypnotic in the way it tightly enveloped the audience\\" at the \\"seamless art-rock concert[s]\\". Continuum was partially funded by the National Arts Council's Arts Creation Fund. The Straits Times found Continuum a \\"sonically stellar mix\\" and \\"tenebrous but at the same time, musically cutting-edge and far-out\\", giving it four out of five stars. Time Out Singapore ranked Continuum amongst the best albums of 2015, noting that while the album is \\"not their best release by a long shot... this EP of gamelan music spiked with noise and doom rock deserves mad props for its bravery\\". Bandwagon ranked it #7 on its list of Top 10 Singapore LPs of 2015. In February 2016, the band performed Continuum at the Performing Arts Meeting in Yokohama, Japan, directed by Aki Onda as part of a programme curated by Tang Fu Kuen. The one-night performance was supported by the National Arts Council. =August is the Cruellest= * Released: 29 February 2016 * Music composed, performed and arranged by The Observatory * Additional instrumentation on \\"The Weight of It All\\" features Natalie Alexandra Tse on guzheng and Andy Chia on dizi * Recorded and mixed by Leslie Low * Recorded at Solslottet Studios, Bergen, Norway except \\"August is the Cruellest\\" and \\"Brutal Blues\\", recorded at Black Axis & The Well, Singapore * Mastered by James Plotkin * Photographs by Bjorn Vaughn * Album design by Yuen Chee Wai Recorded in Singapore and Norway during the height of the 2015 Southeast Asian haze crisis, August is the Cruellest, inspired by King Crimson, Soft Machine, Zircon Lounge and others, is described by the band as \\"a work of political noise, a punishing challenge to look inward and move forward.\\" The title track, inspired by T. S. Eliot's poem \\"The Waste Land\\", was previously performed live at theatre company Drama Box's Singapore International Festival of Arts 2015 production, The Cemetery. Writer Ng Yi-Sheng described the song as \\"growling rock, loud as bulldozers\\", another critic called it \\"a searing rock track... raw and loud, melancholic and frustrated, and ends with high-pitched feedback\\", while TODAY's Mayo Martin noted that \\"the music evokes anger, frustration, despair and destruction ‚Äî but perhaps also the slightest trace of hope\\". Reviewing the album on Bandwagon, three critics called this \\"proper follow-up to Oscilla\\" \\"challenging and disconcerting\\", \\"sinister, raw and explosive\\", and praised how the production, especially the drums, \\"sounds great\\". \\"Designed to grip you and shock you out of apathy and just make you think‚Äì‚Äìthat's the sense of hope,\\" they noted, singling out \\"Everything is Vibration\\" and \\"The Weight of It All\\" as highlights of \\"their strongest album yet\\", giving it ratings of 8/10, 7/10 and 8.5/10. In a review of their album launch gig, Bandwagon also noted that the album \\"doesn't just see them at their most sonically intrusive ‚Äî they're pissed off.\\" Time Out Singapore's editor Iliyas Ong called August is the Cruellest a \\"seething, fire-breathing monster\\", declaring this \\"soundtrack for our times\\" \\"The Observatory's ‚Äì and possibly the local scene's ‚Äì tightest and most mature effort to date\\". Interviewing the band in TODAY, Kevin Mathews called August is the Cruellest a \\"multi-layered work\\", while he declared it \\"their most accessible of their recent releases\\" and \\"progressive rock with a conscience\\" that \\"succeeds at every level\\" on his blog. The Straits Times' music correspondent Eddino Abdul Hadi gave the album 4/5, noting how it is \\"full of heartfelt anthems\\" and features \\"some of their most visceral and strident anthems to date\\". Eddino highlighted the songs \\"You Have No Heart\\" and \\"Wait For The Real Storm\\" as stand-outs, comparing \\"Low's layered harmonies\\" on the former to his Humpback Oak tunes. Jun Sheng Ng of Juice magazine described August is the Cruellest as an \\"immediate counterpoint to the prevailing spirit and sentiment widespread through the city\\" soon after Singapore's golden jubilee celebrations, noting that it \\"paints a landscape of desolation [and] the infertile and impotent wasteland we are mired in\\". Observing that the songs \\"Everything is Vibration\\" and \\"The Weight of It All\\" reflect the \\"group‚Äôs effort to return to or construct a Southeast Asian or Singaporean sound\\", with their quotes from Yan Jun‚Äôs poetry and use of traditional Chinese instruments like the guzheng and dizi, Ng criticised how \\"they are unavoidably dwarfed by the already heavy weight and influence of Eliot‚Äôs\\". Honeycombers praised August is the Cruellest as an \\"audial commentary on the looming, cataclysmic destruction of the earth\\" and a \\"revolutionary record [that] challenges a negative status quo that many have refused to acknowledge\\". Released on CD, cassette, double vinyl and digitally, August is the Cruellest was launched at the band's acclaimed The Substation gigs on 18 and 19 March 2016, with special guests Dharma and SA Trio and featuring covers of The Cure and Talking Heads.

The interpretations elaborate on Catacombs' theme of madness and reach sonic territories we could never achieve on our own.\\" The album was reviewed positively on Midnight Shift Records' blog: \\"As these artists take The Observatory‚Äôs songs further into a digital register, what seemed like a highly personal album dilates into something like a genre unto itself.\\" Reviewing the album in The Straits Times, Yeow Kai Chai wrote that Behind These Eyes: The Catacombs Remixes \\"meddles with the songs to spectacular effect...Overall, it's a rabbit hole to somewhere riskier and more exciting\\", while Bandwagon called it \\"stunning\\".

After moving to California in the late 1940s and getting involved in show business, Redd became known as \\"Korla Pandit\\", a French-Indian musician from New Delhi, India. However, Redd was actually a light-skinned African-American man from Missouri who passed as Indian. A pathbreaking musical performer in the early days of television, Redd is known for Korla Pandit's Adventures In Music; the show was the first all-music program on television. He also performed live and on radio and made various film appearances, becoming known as the \\"Godfather of Exotica\\". Redd maintained the Korla Pandit persona‚Äîboth in public and in private‚Äîuntil the end of his life. Early life, marriage, and family In 1921, John Roland Redd was born in St. Louis, Missouri as one of seven children. His father, Ernest Redd, was an African-American Baptist pastor. Redd's mother, Doshia O'Nina Johnson, had Anglo and African ancestry. Both parents were descended from African-American enslaved persons. Redd had light skin and straight hair. In 1922, Redd's family moved to Hannibal, Missouri, where they lived for nine years. In 1931, they moved to Columbia, where Redd's father was pastor of the second-largest Baptist church in town. Given the Jim Crow restrictions in the state, Redd and his siblings attended racially segregated public schools for children of color. The Redd family later recalled John Redd as a musical prodigy from the age of three; he could hear a song once and have it memorized, and family members taught him to play piano from an early age. A contemporary of Redd's, the jazz pianist called \\"Sir\\" Charles Thompson, knew Redd from Columbia, where they attended high school together. Later in life, Thompson remembered that as a teenager, Redd was the better piano player of the two. The whole Redd family was musically talented; Redd's two sisters sang, and one played piano. His older brother, Ernest Redd Jr. (known as \\"Speck\\" for his freckles) (1913-1974), also became a jazz pianist and later a band leader in Des Moines, Iowa. John and Ernest Redd played in groups with their older brother Harry, who was also a musician. In the early 1940s, Redd met his sister Frances's white friend and roommate, Beryl June DeBeeson, a Disney artist and former dancer. The two fell in love. They married in Tijuana, Mexico, as interracial marriages were then prohibited in California. Redd and his wife had two sons. Career as musician and entertainer Hollywood and the creation of Korla Pandit By the 1940s, Redd had moved from the Midwest to Los Angeles for more opportunity. His older sisters, Ruth and Frances, had already moved there by 1939. Redd used the name \\"Juan Rolando\\" to gain a job playing the organ on the Los Angeles radio station KMPC. Passing as a Mexican allowed him to join the Musicians Union (which was not open to African-Americans)Liesl Bradner, \\"How a Black Man from Missouri Transformed Himself Into the Indian Liberace\\", New Republic, 18 September 2015. and opened up additional opportunities for studio and club work. Redd and his wife, Beryl, created a new entertainment persona for Redd's use. They thought Redd could have exotic appeal by passing as an Indian because most Americans did not know much about people from India. Beryl designed the makeup and clothing Redd used, and Redd took the name \\"Korla Pandit\\". He developed an elaborate history and continued to add to it during his career. He stated that he had been born in New Delhi, India, to a French opera singer and an Indian Brahmin government official. Supposedly raised in an upper-class Indian household, Redd claimed to have studied music in England as a child, arrived in the United States at age 12, and studied at the University of Chicago. Redd used the Korla Pandit persona‚Äîin public and in private‚Äîfor the rest of his life. In 1948, Redd created and played background music as Korla Pandit for the revival of radio's occult adventure series, Chandu the Magician, achieving atmospheric effects on the Novachord and the Hammond CV (Ancestor of C-3) electronic organ. In 1949, he became a regular organist on Hollywood Holiday, a show that was broadcast from a Los Angeles restaurant. Television success Korla Pandit performed at Tom Breneman's Restaurant, seen here as it looked in 1947. Breneman broadcast his Breakfast in Hollywood radio program from here in the late 1940s. In 1948, while performing as Korla Pandit in Hollywood at a furrier's fashion show, Redd and his wife Beryl met television pioneer Klaus Landsberg. He offered Redd a television show with the stipulation that the musician would also provide accompaniment for Time for Beany, Bob Clampett's popular puppet show. Korla Pandit's Adventures In Music was first telecast on Los Angeles station KTLA in February 1949; it was the first all-music program on television. Viewers soon became familiar with the musical opening, \\"The Magnetic Theme.\\" Landsberg insisted that Redd refrain from speaking and gaze into the camera as he played the Hammond organ and Steinway grand piano, often simultaneously. \\"Not once in 900 performances did he speak on camera, preferring instead to communicate with viewers via that hypnotic gaze.\\" Redd‚Äîknown to the public as Korla Pandit‚Äîbecame an overnight star and one of early television's pioneering musical artists. He widened the array of music associated with the organ and popularized its use. While never dropping his Indian persona, Redd acquired notable friends such as actor Errol Flynn, comedian Bob Hope, and Sabu Dastagir, known for his roles in the documentary Elephant Boy (1937) and the feature Thief of Baghdad (1940). In 1956, Redd moved to San Francisco and performed as Korla Pandit on San Francisco's KGO-TV. He began speaking on his show, espousing a spiritual blend of ideas that entranced many of his fans. After returning to Los Angeles, he became friends with Paramahansa Yogananda, Indian spiritual leader of the Self Realization Fellowship. The leader wrote an introduction to liner notes for one of Redd's records. This was a time of seeking for many Americans, with Alan Watts and Aldous Huxley becoming more prominent intellectuals in California. Redd read widely and incorporated a variety of thought in his talks. In 1967, Redd and his family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, to prevent his sons from being drafted in the Vietnam War. Later career After moving to Canada, Redd returned regularly to the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas for work. In the 1970s, as his television popularity waned, he supplemented his income with a variety of increased personal appearances and performances. Continuing to use the Korla Pandit persona, Redd performed at supper clubs, supermarket openings, car agencies, music and department stores, pizza restaurants, lectures, music seminars, private lessons, and the theater organ circuit. He made a cameo appearance as Korla Pandit in Tim Burton's biographical film about the director Ed Wood (1994), which drew renewed attention to him. Redd's career was revived in the 1990s, and he attracted a new generation, taking them under his wing. \\"The Tiki-lounge music revival gave Korla one last career resurgence and cult following. He recorded with The Muffs.\\" Redd also performed a sold-out show at the legendary Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco. Death and revelations Redd died in Petaluma, California on October 1 or October 2, 1998. He was survived by his wife, Beryl, and their sons, Shari and Koram. (Koram would later rename himself John Pandit.) Two years after Redd's death, R.J. Smith, magazine editor of Los Angeles, published an article revealing Redd's true ancestry. During his life, Redd kept in touch with his family of origin, but he wore his turban and did not bring his sons when visiting with them. According to Redd's nephew, Ernest Redd, \\"'Among the family we knew what he was doing and very little was said about it. There was times when he would come by, and it was kind of like a sneak visit. He might come at night sometime and be gone before we got up. He had to separate himself from the family to a certain extent. They would go to see him play, but they wouldn‚Äôt speak to him. They would go to his show and then they would leave, and the family would greet him at a later time'\\". Allyson Hobbs, assistant professor of history at Stanford University, wrote A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life (2014). Having met members of Redd's extended family of origin, Hobbs has said that they \\"felt he was very authentic and were very close to him\\". Redd's sons heard rumors about their father's background, but were only told of his (and their own) African- American heritage after his death. Shari Pandit died before the publication of Smith's 2001 article, and John Pandit rejected Smith's findings. Intrigued by the Smith article, John Turner and Eric Christensen, retired TV producers who had each known Redd in his later years, made a documentary entitled Korla (2014). The duo wrote and produced the film together and Turner directed it. The duo interviewed an array of friends, fellow musicians, and family, discussing Redd's life and achievements and exploring the complexities of racial identity.\\"Korla Pandit Documentary 7/22/15\\", Emmy San Francisco Events, July 2015. After Korla was widely released, various media outlets commented on Redd's history, casting it as a classic American story of self-invention.

The lodge was designed in 1924 as a compromise solution between its developer, the Utah Parks Company, which wanted a large hotel, and National Park Service director Stephen Mather, who desired smaller-scale development. The Utah Parks Company had been formed in 1923 as a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, and was, like many similar programs, intended to stimulate passenger rail traffic to the national parks of southwest Utah. Newer hotel building at Zion Lodge Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge as part of a series of similar structures for the Utah Parks Company at the north rim of the Grand Canyon and at Bryce Canyon National Park. Underwood's design was more modest in scale and detailing than those at the Grand Canyon and Bryce, substituting milled lumber for whole logs in a \\"studs-out\\" style. Underwood used less stonework, in smaller pieces. The structures were designed to be more in keeping with the character of the valley floor, which at the time of construction was still inhabited by settlers. Underwood would go on to design all of the Utah Parks Company buildings in the valley, many of which are included in the Zion Lodge Historic District, which surrounds the lodge. A fire in 1966 destroyed the original lodge. It was rebuilt within 100 days, but the original rustic look was lost in favor of expedience in reopening the lodge. A 1990 remodel restored its original look. In addition to the main lodge building there are a number of original buildings that remain in the lodge complex. This includes guest cabins built in 1927 and 1929, employee dormitories built in 1927 and 1937, and a few support buildings. All were designed by Underwood. On April 12, 1995, a landslide blocked the Virgin River downstream from the lodge. Over a period of two hours, the river had carved away 590 feet (180 m) of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees in the lodge. A one-lane temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation. Access to the lodge was restored on May 25, 1995. Zion Lodge is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The two parts of the city are connected by a high-level fixed road bridge, the Mubarak Peace Bridge.  History  El Qantara was built next to a site of an ancient city Sele (, , Tcharou). During World War I, Kantara, as it was referred to by the Allied troops, was the site of Headquarters No. 3 Section, Canal Defences and Headquarters Eastern Force during the latter stages of the Defence of the Suez Canal Campaign and the Sinai Campaign of 1916. The massive distribution warehouse and hospital centre supported and supplied all British, Australian and New Zealand operations in the Sinai from 1916 until final demobilization in 1919. Beginning in January 1916, a new railway was constructed from Kantara to Romani, and eastward through the Sinai to El Arish and Rafa on the border with the Ottoman Empire. A water pipeline was constructed along the same route by the Royal Engineers under the command of Brigadier General Everard Blair.Lewis P (2014) For Kent and Country, pp.104‚Äì107. Brighton: Reveille Press. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery and Memorial is located outside of town. It was begun in February, 1916 and remained in use until late 1920. After the war, it was doubled in size to accommodate the remains of soldiers from makeshift cemeteries and desert battlefields, notably in Qatia, Rumani, Magdhaba, El Arish and Rafa. Formally designed in 1919 by Sir Robert Lorimer,Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer the cemetery contains 1,562 Commonwealth burials from World War I and 110 from World War II. There are also 341 war graves of other nationalities. The Kantara Memorial bears the names of 16 New Zealand World War I servicemen presumed killed in action at Rafa and Rumani. In 1961, panels bearing the names of 283 World War I Indian servicemen, interred in the now inaccessible Kantara Indian Cemetery, were affixed to the wall behind the Stone of Remembrance, forming the Kantara Indian Cemetery Memorial. The town's importance as a hospital centre was renewed during World War II when General Hospital No. 1 was located there from July 1941 to December 1945, and General Hospitals Nos. 41 and 92 at different periods. No. 8 Polish General Hospital was constructed adjoining the war cemetery. During the 1967 Six Day War, Israel captured the town. Egypt recaptured it at the start of the 1973 Yom Kippur War during The Crossing, and held it until the ceasefire was negotiated. Egypt regained formal control over the town in 1974.

He was active in the Greenwich Village folk scene in the 1960s, primarily as a session guitarist for folk albums and performances. Biography  Early Life  Langhorne was born in Tallahassee, Florida, where his father taught at the Florida Agriculture and Mechanical College for Negroes. From the age of four, he lived with his mother in Spanish Harlem, in New York City. He learned violin, but lost most of three fingers of his right hand as a child when lighting a homemade rocket. He was expelled from Horace Mann Prep School, and later claimed that as a teenage gang member he was involved in a stabbing, following which he lived for two years in Mexico. He started playing guitar at the age of 17, and the loss of his fingers contributed to his distinctive playing style.Michael Ross, \\"Forgotten Heroes: Bruce Langhorne\\", Premier Guitar, June 9, 2014. Retrieved 15 April 2017  Early Career in Greenwich Village  He began accompanying folk singer Brother John Sellers at clubs in Greenwich Village, soon starting to work with other musicians. Langhorne worked with many of the major performers in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem, Joan Baez, Richie Havens, Carolyn Hester, Peter LaFarge, Gordon Lightfoot, Hugh Masekela, Odetta, Babatunde Olatunji, Peter, Paul and Mary, Richard and Mimi Fari√±a, Tom Rush, Steve Gillette, and Buffy Sainte-Marie. He first recorded in 1961, with Carolyn Hester, which is when he met Bob Dylan. He later said of Dylan: \\"I thought he was a terrible singer and a complete fake, and I thought he didn't play harmonica that well.... I didn't really start to appreciate Bobby as something unique until he started writing.\\" In 1963 he accompanied Dylan on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, and in 1965 was one of several guitarists on the album Bringing It All Back Home.  Mr. Tambourine Man  The title character of Bob Dylan's song \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" was probably inspired by Langhorne, who used to play a large Turkish frame drum in performances and recordings. The drum, which Langhorne purchased in a music store in Greenwich Village, had small bells attached around its interior, giving it a jingling sound much like a tambourine. Langhorne used the instrument most prominently on recordings by Richard and Mimi Fari√±a. The drum is now in the collection of the Experience Music Project, in Seattle, Washington.  Work With Bob Dylan  In addition to inspiring the title character of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", Langhorne played the electric guitar countermelody on the song. His guitar is also prominent on several other songs on Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album, particularly \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" and \\"She Belongs to Me\\"; he also played the lead guitar parts on \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\", \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" and \\"Maggie's Farm\\". He also played the guitar for Dylan's television performances of \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" on The Les Crane Show in February 1965, a month after the Bringing It All Back Home sessions. Two years earlier, Langhorne performed on \\"Corrina, Corrina\\", on the album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, and on the outtake \\"Mixed-Up Confusion\\", which was eventually released on Biograph. Years later, Langhorne played on tracks for Dylan's album Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.  Movie Music Composer  Langhorne composed the music for the Peter Fonda western film The Hired Hand (1971), which combined sitar, fiddle, and banjo. He also provided the scores for Fonda's 1973 science fiction film Idaho Transfer and his 1976 vigilante movie Fighting Mad (directed by Jonathan Demme). Other films featuring Langhorne's scores include Stay Hungry (1976), Melvin and Howard (1980) and Night Warning (1982). In 1992, Langhorne founded a hot-sauce company, Brother Bru-Bru's African Hot Sauce. The hot sauce is unique for containing \\"African spices\\" and all-natural or organic, no-sodium or low-sodium ingredients.

El Cerro de La Iglesia, 1985 Gonzalo Endara Crow (1936-1996, Bucay, Ecuador) was a Latin American writer and painter.\\"Gonzalo Endara Crow\\" Minnesota State University - Moorhead. Retrieved 2016-07-07. From an early age he was very interested in art and as a young man he studied painting at the Central University in Quito. Endara Crow's work took on a distinct style early in his career that stayed with him throughout his life. Ecuadorian geography and the bright colors used by indigenous artisans in their work were two major influences that penetrated Endara Crow's work for his entire career. Gonzalo Endara Crow is considered one of the most important Latin American painters of the second half of the 20th century. His work was universal and offered an aesthetic perspective of Andean culture and people. His most recognized painting is \\"El Tren Volador\\" (The Flying Train). As a child, Endara Crow was amazed by trains since his grandfather worked at the railroad; this became an inspiration for his masterpiece, in which he depicts a flying train -hence the title- that blends into a colorful mountainous landscape. Another common surreal motif in his paintings was raining bells or spheres as in his Untitled work dated July 29, 1988. Endara was also a sculptor, and sculpted two important monuments in Sangolqu√≠, Ecuador. These two monuments are \\"El Choclo\\" and \\"El Colibr√≠\\". Some of his pieces encompass elements of painting and sculpture both such as \\"El Cerro de la Iglesia\\" (1985) an acrylic work enclosed inside a wood portal. Various art historians and critics have referred to his work as magical realism, a term often used when speaking of twentieth-century Latin American literature. Just as in magical realist texts, paintings by Endara Crow seek to expand the categories of what is real so as to encompass myth. Magic and other extraordinary phenomena in nature - all which are excluded by European culture - find their place in Endara Crow's painting. Magical realism in painting can be distinguished by the way in which reality and fantasy are blended. Any distinction between the two is erased through the combination of fantasy elements and mythology with otherwise unrealistic fiction. As in the magical realist texts of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Gonzalo Endara Crow's paintings weave in fantastic elements with deadpan presentation transforming the unlikely into certain reality with a subtle mechanism: the treatment of light.

Highway 33 continues north from Swan Hills to Highway 2 east of Kinuso. Highway 33 is about in length.  History  Highway 33 follows the original Klondike Trail, which was advertised by Edmonton merchants as the shortest route to the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush, from the Athabasca River at Pruden's Crossing, near Fort Assiniboine, through present-day Swan Hills and along the Swan River to north to present-day Kinuso. The trail followed a very difficult and dangerous route and by 1901-02 use of the trail declined, soon after it was abandoned altogether in favour of other routes to the Peace River area. Highway 33 originally started as short highway that connected Highway 43, south of Onoway, to Alberta Beach. In the 1970s, Highway 33 was extended north to Barrhead from Gunn, resulting in an gap between Alberta Beach and Gunn. Highway 18, which ran between Barrhead and Swan Hills, was renumbered to Highway 33 and the highway was extended north to Kinuso. In , the original section to Alberta Beach became part of Highway 633.

July 1453), known as the Younger, was a highly influential Ottoman grand vizier under the sultans Murad II and, for the first few years of his reign, Mehmed II (from 1439 to 1 June 1453 precisely).ƒ∞smail H√¢mi Dani≈ümend, Osmanlƒ± Devlet Erk√¢nƒ±, T√ºrkiye Yayƒ±nevi, ƒ∞stanbul, 1971, p. 10. (Turkish) He was a member of the √áandarlƒ± family, a highly influential political family in the Ottoman Empire. His grandfather and namesake, √áandarlƒ± Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha (√áandarlƒ± Halil Pasha the Elder), also earlier served as grand vizier, under Murad I. Biography Halil Pasha was the fourth and penultimate member of the √áandarlƒ± family to hold the position of grand vizier in the Ottoman Empire. His father, √áandarlƒ± Ibrahim Pasha the Elder, his uncle, √áandarlƒ± Ali Pasha, and his grandfather √áandarlƒ± Halil Pasha the Elder had also held the position in the past. His own son, √áandarlƒ± Ibrahim Pasha the Younger, would also become grand vizier in the future. Twice during his reign, sultan Murad II, a man more interested in religion and the arts than politics, retired to the city of Manisa. For the sultan's protection, Halil Pasha had a castle built in a nearby town, renaming it √áandarlƒ± after his own family (the castle is still the most famous landmark in √áandarlƒ± today). During these times of Murad II's retirement, Halil Pasha held effective control of the empire in the capital Edirne with Mehmed II, then still a child, as the nominal sultan. On both occasions, with the dangers presented by allied European armies attacking Ottoman territories, √áandarlƒ± called back Murad II and deposed the teenaged Mehmed II to replace him with his more capable father. These two incidents led to lasting resentment by Mehmed II towards √áandarlƒ±. The fact that the √áandarlƒ± family, which had become extremely wealthy from their influence in the empire for over a century, possibly more so than even the ruling Ottoman family itself, further strained tensions between Mehmed II and Halil Pasha, the scion of the √áandarlƒ± family. When Mehmed II became sultan, the Byzantine emperor Constantine XI sent a messenger to the Ottomans, asking for an increase of the annuity of Orhan or otherwise to release him.The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453, Donald M. Nicol, page 375, 1993 Orhan was a distant Ottoman family member and could claim himself as pretender for the throne and potentially start a civil war. This strategy of disruption was used by the Byzantines several times before. Halil Pasha became infuriated at the message and replied to the messengers: In 1453, one of the first acts committed by the (then fully reigning) Emperor Mehmed II immediately after the conquest of Constantinople was to imprison √áandarlƒ± Halil Pasha. The city had been taken on 29 May 1453 and Halil Pasha's imprisonment took place on 1 June 1453. His execution followed on 10 July 1453. Mehmed II thus ended the √áandarlƒ± era in the Ottoman Empire, and the later members of the family, whose descendants survive to the present day, became no more than provincial notables based in ƒ∞znik, although they were to give yet another, short-term, grand vizier to the Ottoman Empire at the end of the 15th century (Halil's son √áandarlƒ± Ibrahim Pasha the Younger). √áandarlƒ± Halil Pasha was, as such, the first Ottoman grand vizier to be executed by the sultan.

It is the administrative center of Moba Territory. Location Moba is situated on the western shore of the southern part of Lake Tanganyika, south-east of Kalemie, to which it is linked by regular boat services. The Rafiki is the largest and most comfortable of the available ferry services. The larger town of Kirungu (Kilungu) is on a plateau above the lake and 5 km from Moba. A dirt road leads down from Kirungu to a jetty in Moba. Moba lies just south of the Mulobozi river. The Marungu highlands, a range of steep rugged hills, rises behind the town, bisected by the Mulobozi. The smaller northern section rises to an elevation of about and the larger southern section to about . The highest mountain in Moba is called Murumbi. People In 1984 Moba had a population of 25,463. Its tribe is mostly Tabwa. History The city was created in 1893 by White Monks, who called it Baudoinville/Boudewijnstad after Prince Baudouin of Belgiumhttps://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/01/22/boudewijn-voor-boudewijn--de- kroonprins-die-nooit-koning-zou-wor/. Civil war and aftermath During the Second Congo War (1998-2003) the region became a battle zone between government forces and rebel groups. The area between Pweto, Moba and Moliro has been called the \\"Triangle of Death\\". In November 2000, DRC government troops with Interahamwe fighters, former Rwandan army troops now fighting for the DRC government and other allies launched an offensive. They captured positions held by the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma), such as Pweto, Pepa, and attacked Moba port. The RCD-Goma and Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) forces counter-attacked early in December 2000. The Rwandans re-took Pweto and Moba early in December 2000. On 1 August 2007 a mob of demonstrators assaulted United Nations military observers and damaged offices belonging to the UNHCR and sister agencies. The United Nations withdrew from the town and ceased repatriation of refugees living in Zambia. Economy There are no paved roads in the Moba area nor within several hundred kilometres of the town. Two dirt roads, frequently impassable in the rainy season, are the only access by land from the west and south. Moba had long been without electricity. Since 1996, there is a small hydroelectric dam built to provide its population with electricity. This dam was sponsored by an Italian NGO, Mondo Gusto, on Ngandwe Fuamba river. Economic activity in Moba is mostly farming, fishing and gold mining.

He built the first gas turbine that was able to produce more power than needed to run its own components.√Ügidius Elling (Store norske leksikon) Elling was born in and grew up in Oslo, Norway. He studied mechanical engineering at Kristiania Technical College, (now part of Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences) graduating in 1881. Between 1885-1902, he worked as an engineer and designer at a number of workshops in Sweden and Norway. His first gas turbine patent was granted in 1884. In 1903 he completed the first turbine that produced excess power; his original machine used both rotary compressors and turbines to produce net.Gas Turbine Engines - The History of Gas Turbine Engines He further developed the concept, and by 1912 he had developed a gas turbine system with separate turbine unit and compressor in series, a combination that is now common. Gas Turbine History (TurboMachine.com) One major challenge was to find materials that could withstand the high temperatures developed in the turbine to achieve high output powers. His 1903 turbine could withstand inlet temperatures up to 400¬∞ Celsius (752¬∞ F). Elling understood that if better materials could be found, the gas turbine would be an ideal power source for airplanes. Many years later, Sir Frank Whittle, building on the early work of Elling, managed to build a practical gas turbine engine for an airplane, the jet engine. Ellings gas turbine prototypes from 1903 and 1912 are exhibited at Norsk Teknisk Museum in Oslo. Elling also did significant development work in other areas, such as steam engine controls, pumps, compressors, vacuum drying et cetera. In 1914 Elling produced a book called Billig opvarmning: veiledning i at behandle magasinovner √∏konomisk og letvint. (), which was published by Aschehoug.

It also provides training and technical assistance to Wisconsin's business and industry community. Over 370,000 individuals accessed the technical colleges for education and training in the 2010-11 school year.Wisconsin Technical College System. Fact Book 2012: Systemwide Headcount 2002-2011 History The Wisconsin Legislature passed laws in 1911 requiring cities with a population of 5,000 people or more to set up trade schools and school boards to administer them.Chapter 616, Laws of Wisconsin, 1911 The schools had four purposes: to provide continuing education of boys and girls 14-16 who had quit high school, trade school, adult evening education, and related instruction for apprentices. Wisconsin became the first state to establish a system of state support for vocational, technical, and adult education schools. In 1911 the Wisconsin apprenticeship Law was passed; employers were required to release apprentices to the trade schools if one was available and to pay regular hourly wages for time spent at school.Chapter 601.1 Laws of Wisconsin, 1911 Both of these bills resulted from the work of Charles McCarthy, the first director of the present-day state Legislative Reference Bureau. The Smith- Hughes Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1917, was modeled after Wisconsin's initiative. In 1961, the school boards were authorized to offer associate's degree for two-year technical courses. In 1965, the state legislature required a system of vocational, technical, and adult education districts to cover the entire state by 1970. Following this, enrollments in the WTCS doubled from 1967 to 1982. There were significant increases in the number of associate degree programs in the 1970s. Schools were also required to improve cooperation and coordination with the University of Wisconsin System. In 1993, the state board was designated as the Technical College System Board, and the colleges became referred to as \\"Technical Colleges\\".

Counties in red are always included, while counties in pink are only sometimes included. The Intermountain West, or Intermountain Region, is a geographic and geological region of the Western United States. It is located between the front ranges of the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada on the west. Topography The Intermountain West has a basin and range and plateau topography. Some of the region's rivers reach the Pacific Ocean, such as the Columbia River and Colorado River. Other regional rivers and streams are in endorheic basins and cannot reach the sea, such as the Walker River and Owens River. These flow into brackish or seasonally dry lakes or desert sinks. Portions of this region include: * Basin and Range Province * Colorado Plateau * Great Basin * Intermontane Plateaus Climate The climate of the Intermountain Region is affected by location and elevation. The sub-regions are in rain shadows from the Cascade or Sierra Nevada ranges that block precipitation from Pacific storms. The winter weather depends on latitude. In the southern portion, winters are shorter, warmer and have less winter precipitation and snow. In the northern portion, winters are cold and moist. All areas have hot summers. North American Monsoon storms can occur in the region during the mid-summer, coming northeast from the Pacific Ocean and Mexican Plateau. Natural history The flora at lower elevations includes deserts and xeric shrublands and temperate grasslands and shrublands biome vegetation. Higher elevation montane habitats include temperate coniferous forests biome vegetation, including groves and forests of various species of pine, cedar, juniper, aspen, and other trees, and understory shrubs, and perennials. Intermountain West ecoregions include: * Central Basin and Range ecoregion ‚Äî North American Deserts; Level III ecoregion (EPA) * Columbia Plateau (ecoregion) ‚Äî Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (WWF) * Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills (ecoregion) ‚Äî Northwestern Forested Mountains; Level III ecoregion (EPA) * Great Basin shrub steppe ‚Äî Deserts and xeric shrublands biome (WWF) * Great Basin montane forests ‚Äî Temperate coniferous forest biome (WWF) * Northern Basin and Range ecoregion ‚Äî North American Deserts; Level III ecoregion (EPA) * Palouse grasslands ecoregion ‚Äî Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (WWF) * Snake River Plain (ecoregion) ‚Äî North American Deserts; Level III ecoregion (EPA) * Wasatch and Uinta montane forests ecoregion ‚Äî Temperate coniferous forest biome (WWF) Some sections are agriculturally cultivated with water diversions for irrigation systems. Cattle ranching is practiced in the region as well. Cultivated crops include corn, potatoes, sugar beets, grass hay, and alfalfa, the latter two crops are used for livestock feed. Demographics and sociology For thousands of years the Intermountain West has been the homeland for many Native American cultures, tribes, and bands. The 18th-century fur trade (northern areas), and 19th-century westward expansion of the United States brought irreversible cultural changes. The completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through the region accelerated non-native settlements and development. Historically, the Intermountain West area centered in Utah is associated with Latter-day Saint (Mormon) settlements, and the region has the highest percentage of LDS members in the United States currently. That region is also known as the Mormon Corridor. Because of its low population density and diverse economy, the survivalist writers James Wesley Rawles and Joel SkousenAbout Joel Skousen both recommend the region as a preferred locale for \\"strategic relocation\\" and for building survival retreats, thus referring to it as the American Redoubt.  Intermountain states  The intermountain states are generally considered to be Nevada, Utah, Idaho south of the Salmon River, the western third of Montana, Arizona north of the Mogollon Rim, Colorado from the Front Range westward, New Mexico from the central mountain chain westward, and Far West Texas from the Pecos River westward. The intermountain states are so named from having all or portions between the Rockies, Sierras, and Cascades. The intermountain states are included among states classified as the Mountain States.

Location and Campus The new campus was completed in March 2009 and opened that same year in August. The building houses 9th through 12th grades and the former senior high, now the junior high, is home to 7th and 8th graders. Carthage High School is now located on the southeastern edge of town on River Street close to the facilities of the Fair Acres YMCA. In fact, the high school soccer and swim teams use the YMCA's pool and soccer fields to practice. The new Technical Center opened in 2010 on the high school campus. Notably, the school's football stadium and related practice facilities are still located on the campus of the Carthage Middle School, on Centennial Avenue. There have been attempts in recent years to construct a new stadium on the land adjacent to the high school along with a separate soccer/track and field complex and much more. Nearing the end of the 2016, there was a new stadium/field house being constructed on the land adjacent to the current school. David Haffner Stadium was completed and released to the public in June 2017. History Carthage's first school likely opened around 1848, on the town square's north side. (Surviving records are unclear at best, but numerous sources make mention of such a school.) The first high school opened its doors at the present location in 1860, with Samuel Kealand acting as its first Principal. Officially named the Carthage Male and Female Academy, the school was built at a cost of $1,000, on donated land. As was fashionable at the time, the wood-framed building included a cupola, complete with a 125 lb (275 kg) cast iron bell, that was imported from Sheffield, England. The Male and Female Academy was destroyed in an 1861 fire, when the city was razed during the American Civil War. The bell is the only part of that original building that survives. It was restored and placed on permanent display in the current school in 1917, through donations from alumni. Following the Civil War, the Central School was built in 1872, on the location of the destroyed Male and Female Academy. A stately red brick structure, it stood on the corner of Main and Chestnut Streets for the next 79 years. After construction of the current school building to its north, the old Central School building was converted to an annex and renamed the Manual Arts Building. The building was eventually demolished in 1951, to make way for the current school's gymnasium addition. Due to the post-war zinc and lead mining boom in southwest Missouri, Carthage saw significant population growth. This led to the need for a larger high school. In 1904, the high school (the current junior high) was completed, at a cost of $100,000. Academics Carthage High School has continued to receive high marks from the Missouri State Accreditation Counsel for distinction in academic performance. Additionally, the school's ACT Test average score is higher than the national average. Carthage High school offers students the opportunity to engage in college level coursework through Advanced Placement Classes and Dual Credit Enrollment from the surrounding colleges. CHS has also received high scores on student End-Of-Course Examinations, mandated by the State of Missouri. In 2011, Carthage the \\"5 Star Leadership School\\" Distinction, which encourages students to become even more active in regard to sportsmanship, character, education, and citizenship. Carthage was one of few schools to receive this award. Athletics The Tigers have had recent success in all of their athletic programs, most notably the football team. Going 9-1 in 2004 and 9-1 in 2005, the Tigers have made it to the Missouri state playoffs every year since including going 10-1 in 2007. In 2019, the Tigers won the Missouri Class 5 State Championship. The soccer team has also had a lot of success in recent years coming within a game of the state championship in three of the last four years.

Classical Greek concepts of pleonexia  Classical Greek philosophers such as Plato related pleonexia to justice. Thrasymachus, in Book I of The Republic, presents pleonexia as a natural state, upon which justice is an unnatural restraint. In discussing the philosophy of Aristotle, who insisted in his Nicomachean Ethics that all specifically unjust actions are motivated by pleonexia, Kraut, cited by discusses pleonexia and equates it to epichairekakia, the Greek version of schadenfreude, stating that inherent in pleonexia is the appeal of acting unjustly at the expense of others. Young,, also cited by Keyt however argues that the simple involvement of unfairness in the desire for gaining ever more is what defines pleonexia, rather than that the desire itself be for gaining ever more in a manner that is specifically unfair. Thomas Hobbes includes it as a concept of natural law in Leviathan: > If in this case, at the making of Peace, men require for themselves, that > which they would not have to be granted to others, they do contrary to the > precedent law, that commandeth the acknowledgement of naturall equalitie, > and therefore also against the law of Nature. The observers of this law, are > those we call Modest, and the breakers Arrogant Men. The Greeks call the > violation of this law œÄŒªŒµŒøŒΩŒµŒæŒØŒ±; that is, a desire of more than their > share.Hobbes, Thomas: Leviathan: Chapter XV. Of Other Lawes of Nature  Christian concepts of pleonexia  Pleonexia, being mentioned in the New Testament in Colossians 3 verses 1-11 and Luke 12 verses 13-21, has been the subject of commentary by Christian theologians. William Barclay describes pleonexia as an \\"accursed love of having\\", which \\"will pursue its own interests with complete disregard for the rights of others, and even for the considerations of common humanity\\". He labels it an aggressive vice that operates in three spheres of life. In the material sphere involves \\"grasping at money and goods, regardless of honour and honesty\\". In the ethical sphere it is \\"the ambition which tramples on others to gain something which is not properly meant for it\\". In the moral sphere, it is \\"the unbridled lust which takes its pleasure where it has no right to take\\". Christian belief equates pleonexia with idolatry, because it replaces God with self-interest and material interest in things.

Designed by Douglas Ellington, construction of the original building began in 1927 and was completed two years later. The modern addition was built in 1970 and a new cafeteria was finished in 2006. There is a second school located at the same address; the School of Inquiry and Life Sciences at Asheville (SILSA). History After the railroad system reached Asheville in 1881, the population of the city grew from 2,000 to 10,000. In response to this population influx, Asheville began a public school system in 1888, which originally consisted of a high school and three elementary schools. The elementary schools were the Orange Street School (currently occupied by NC DOT offices), Queen Carson Elementary School (currently occupied by a bus garage) and Montford Avenue School (replaced by the current William Randolph Elementary in the early 1950s). The high school was located at the corner of Broadway and Woodfin Street, in what had been the private home of Nicholas Woodfin. After use for educational purposes ceased about 1923 this structure was the downtown YMCA until a new structure was built further east on Woodfin about 1970, and the old building torn down. The former high school campus is currently occupied by a bank. The City of Asheville built two structures in the early 1920s, Hall Fletcher in West Asheville and David Millard, on Oak Street, adjacent to First Baptist Church, which, together, were known as Asheville High School. The David Millard Campus occupied a portion of the grounds of a former girls' school, with the balance of the former school grounds covered by the Church. Athletic teams and extracurricular clubs were drawn from both campuses. The former site of David Millard is currently covered by One Oak Plaza and the extension of Charlotte Street, and the West Asheville campus is currently occupied by a new Hall Fletcher Elementary School. The current University of North Carolina at Asheville began in 1927 as a two-year college, known as Asheville-Biltmore College, using classrooms on the ground floor of David Millard. The population of Asheville continued to grow in the late 1920s. By 1926 the school board agreed that \\"a large, central high school plant\\" was needed. A committee formed to locate a suitable location reported that it found \\"only one site within the City of sufficient size, and of reasonable price ‚Ä¶ this tract of land lies between Victoria Road and the new McDowell Street.\\" Out of seven architects submitting proposals for the new high school, Douglas D. Ellington was selected by majority vote. In addition Nickolaus Louis Englehardt of Columbia University was hired as an advisor to the architect. Englehardt had worked a great deal in school planning and design on a national level. Ellington and Englehardt's collaboration made the new Asheville High a model facility in terms of architecture and educational offerings. The former Asheville High School was renamed David Millard Junior High School and, together with Hall Fletcher, served as the city's junior high schools for a time. With a cost of $1.3 million ($18.8 million in 2016 dollars) Asheville High School opened on February 5, 1929, with a dedication ceremony in the auditorium including as speakers the Mayor of Asheville, the superintendent of Asheville City Schools, Douglas Ellington, Lee H. Edwards, the president of the PTA, the Headmaster of the Asheville School and the president of Duke University. When first opened, Asheville High had a wide variety of vocational programs including automotive mechanics, full print shops (all yearbooks, newspapers, and magazines were printed on-campus), mechanical drawing, and photography, including a darkroom. When the stock market crashed in September 1929, it took Asheville by surprise. This forced the programming for the schools, and indeed the city's economic well-being, to hit rock bottom. For a time, Asheville High was closed, and students were removed to David Millard and Hall Fletcher. All extras were cut for a time, including much of the school's technical curriculum. In 1935 the school was renamed Lee H. Edwards High School in honor of Principal Edwards, who died unexpectedly that year. The name \\"Asheville High School\\" returned with integration in 1969. In 1949, another vocational facility (known today as the ROTC building) was created across from the original shop wing. This facility was built by students in the vocational program, as a real-world example of construction. In 1968, another larger vocational building was built. In the early 1970s, a media center addition was added to the main building. In 1973, a new gym and athletic facility was attached to the old vocational building. In the early 1990s, a $3.5 million cultural arts building was built. Finally, in 2006, a new $3.1 million cafeteria was added to the campus. On October 5, 2008, then Senator Barack Obama visited Asheville High School in his race for the White House. Over 25,000 people showed up at the Football Stadium to see Obama deliver his rally speech. In 2016, city school officials identified $25 million in needed repairs. The biggest problem was the roof, with thousands of clay tiles which would all have to be removed (and possibly replaced afterward) for the work. Jack Thomson, executive director of the Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County, called the building \\"a master work of Ellington.\\" Notable alumni *Sarah Addison Allen, author *John Avery, former NFL and CFL running back *Crezdon Butler, NFL and CFL cornerback *Chris Chalk, actor in The Newsroom and Homeland *Dave Cheadle, former 1st round MLB draft pick by the New York Yankees *Lawson Duncan, former professional tennis playerhttps://clemsontigers.com/clemson-vault-tennis-great-lawson-duncan/. clemsontigers.com.

Shortly after Michael Synott died in 1780 the area was purchased by William Thetford and Charles Abercrombie, who built West Point Mill. While these mills were being produced a community began to build up and became known as West Point. The community was successful for a period of time but eventually all of its inhabitants died out or moved on. West Point Mill served its owners for 160 years until it was shut down by a paratrooper named Jacob Eller returning from the war in 1942, the last mill on the Eno to do so. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

It resembles a labyrinth of multiple defensive walls. Background The Padmavy≈´ha is a multi-tiered defensive formation that looks like a blooming lotus ( ) or disc ( ) when viewed from above. The warriors at each interleaving position would be in an increasingly tough position to fight against. The formation was used in the battle of Kurukshetra by Dronacharya, who became commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army after the fall of Bhishma Pitamaha. The various vy≈´has (military formations) were studied by the Kauravas and Pandavas alike. Most of them can be beaten using a counter-measure targeted specifically against that formation. In the form of battle described in the Mahabharata, it was important to place powerful fighters in positions where they could inflict maximum damage to the opposing force, or defend their own side. As per this military strategy, a specific stationary object or a moving object or person could be captured, surrounded and fully secured during battle. The formation begins with two soldiers standing back-to-back, with other such set of soldiers standing at a distance of three hands, drawing up seven circles and culminating in the end which is the place where the captured person or object is to be kept. In order to form the Chakravyuha, the commander has to identify soldiers who will form this formation. The number of soldiers to be deployed and the size of the Chakravyuha is calculated as per the resistance estimated. Once drawn, the foremost soldiers come on either side of the opponent to be captured, engage briefly and then advance. Their place is taken up by the next soldiers on either side, who again engage the opponent briefly and then advance. In this fashion, a number of soldiers pass the enemy and proceed in a circular pattern. By the time the rear of the formation arrives, the oblivious enemy is surrounded on all sides by seven tiers of soldiers. The last soldiers of the formation give the signal of having completed the Chakravyuha. On the signal, every soldier who so far has been facing outwards turns inwards to face the opponent. It is only then that the captured enemy realizes his captivity. The army can continue to maintain the circular formation while leading the captive away.  Abhimanyu and the Chakravy≈´ha  The Chakravy≈´ha or Padmavy≈´ha was a very special formation (), and knowledge of how to penetrate it was limited to only a handful of warriors on the Pandavas' side, namely: Abhimanyu, Arjuna, Krishna and Pradyumna, of which only Abhimanyu was present when the Kauravas used it on the battlefield. In the Mahabharata it is mentioned that Abhimanyu learnt about the Chakravy≈´ha while in his mother's womb but he was not able to hear how to escape the formation. After Abhimanyu had penetrated the sixth tier of the formation, all the Kauravas' commanders attacked him simultaneously, which was against the righteous rules of warfare Dharmayuddha, and gradually exhausted and killed him.

The Picture Gallery is situated east of the palace and is the oldest extant museum built for a ruler in Germany. History Interior of the Picture Gallery, looking east from the entrance Frederick II was a passionate collector of paintings. In his youth, he preferred the contemporary French art of the Rococo, and the walls of his rooms in Sanssouci were adorned with paintings of his favorite artist Antoine Watteau. After his accession to the throne in 1740, the king became increasingly interested in history paintings, which were highly regarded at his time. Especially, he collected works of renaissance, mannerism and Baroque art, mostly from Italian and Flemish artists. Due to the opening of the Altes Museum in Berlin in 1829, about fifty paintings were transferred there. Among these were the Leda by Correggio, three paintings by Rembrandt, some by Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Antoine Watteau. Also, all the marble statues were moved. In 1929-30, the Picture Gallery was set up again, and 120 of the 159 works marked in the catalogue as purchased by Frederick returned from Berlin. During World War II, all the paintings were moved to Rheinsberg Palace in Rheinsberg. Only ten paintings returned from there in 1946, and most of the pictures seemed lost. However, a large collection of paintings confiscated by the Soviet Union was returned in 1958. However, some of the pictures are still in Russian collections. Outside architecture The Picture Gallery was built in the place of a former greenhouse, which Frederick the Great had used to raise tropical fruit. B√ºring replaced this with a long, single-story building painted in yellow, the middle part of which is emphasized by a dome. On the garden side, marble sculptures stand between the windows reaching down to the floor. Most of the sculptures were made by Johann Gottlieb Heym√ºller and Johann Peter Benckert, and depict allegorical figures from arts and sciences. The heads on the keystones show portraits of artists. The gallery The gallery hall is magnificently designed with richly gilded ornaments on the slightly curved ceiling. The floor is laid out in matching colors with a rhombic pattern of white and yellow Italian marble. On the green walls, the framed paintings are laid out densely above and alongside each other in a Baroque style. Some of the works exhibited are Caravaggio's Increduility of St Thomas, Anthony van Dycks Pentecost, and Four Evangelists and Saint Hieronymus from the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens. Adjacent to the long gallery hall is the similarly richly arranged cabinet, where the paintings of smaller format are exhibited.

Additionally, the \\"density\\" of A is 1 at almost every point in A. Intuitively, this means that the \\"edge\\" of A, the set of points in A whose \\"neighborhood\\" is partially in A and partially outside of A, is negligible. Let Œº be the Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean space Rn and A be a Lebesgue measurable subset of Rn. Define the approximate density of A in a Œµ-neighborhood of a point x in Rn as : d_\\\\varepsilon(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu(A\\\\cap B_\\\\varepsilon(x))}{\\\\mu(B_\\\\varepsilon(x))} where BŒµ denotes the closed ball of radius Œµ centered at x. Lebesgue's density theorem asserts that for almost every point x of A the density : d(x)=\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0} d_{\\\\varepsilon}(x) exists and is equal to 1. In other words, for every measurable set A, the density of A is 0 or 1 almost everywhere in Rn. However, it is a curious fact that if Œº(A) > 0 and , then there are always points of Rn where the density is neither 0 nor 1\\\\. For example, given a square in the plane, the density at every point inside the square is 1, on the edges is 1/2, and at the corners is 1/4. The set of points in the plane at which the density is neither 0 nor 1 is non-empty (the square boundary), but it is negligible. The Lebesgue density theorem is a particular case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem. Thus, this theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on Rn instead of Lebesgue measure, see Discussion.  See also  * Lebesgue differentiation theorem  References  * Hallard T. Croft.

These programs range from a two and a half year graduate certificate program, one day training seminars, and online courses. The Institute operates as a 501c3, educational organization. THI is an affiliate of the American Humanist Association with an independent Board of Directors, Executive Director, Co-Deans, and staff. The mission of THI is to be the leading center for humanist education serving all branches of humanism. The vision of THI is to provide educational opportunities that serve humanist and secular communities in world where humanism is widely accepted and respected life-stance. History The Institute was founded to educate and train effective leaders, organizers, and advocates for a variety of organizational settings, including within the humanist movement itself.Creating Change Through Humanism by Roy Speckhardt, Publisher: The Humanist Press 2015, , 9780931779664 The idea for the Humanist Institute originated in Pittsburgh in 1976 and was the brainchild of Paul Beattie, a Unitarian Universalist minister. In August 1982, Rabbi Sherwin Wine organized a gathering of forty-five humanist leaders at the University of Chicago [where] the North American Committee for Humanism [NACH] was formed with Rabbi Wine as president. This new alliance was a response to the urgent need to defend humanism against the assaults of its enemies and to find an effective way to bring the message of humanism to a wider public. It was at this meeting that the Humanist Institute was voted to be established.The Ministry and Thought of Paul Hamilton Beattie By Daniel Ross Chandler, UU Humanist Association Journal Archive https://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/3565 It was at this meeting that NACH founded The Humanist Institute. The founding members of the institute were Khoren Arisian, Paul Beattie, Ed Ericson, Paul Kurtz, Howard Radest, Lyle Simpson, and Sherwin Wine. Sherwin Wine served as the founding president with Howard Radest as the founding Dean.The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief by Tom Flynn and Richard Dawkins, Publisher: Prometheus Books, 2007, , 9781615922802 They were soon joined by feminist humanists Miriam Jerris and Jean Kotkins. Each of the original founders were themselves either leaders or founders of other humanist or humanistic organizations such as: the Society for Humanistic Judaism, the Council for Secular Humanism, the American Ethical Union, the Unitarian Universalist Association and the American Humanism Association. In March 1984, The Humanist Institute was launched. The first class with students from the AEU, AHA, UUA, and SHJ gathered in New York at the Ethical Culture center for the first seminar with Howard Radest as mentor. It was the first trans-denominational, trans-humanist organization program for the education of humanist leaders.The History of NACH and The Humanist Institute by Carol Wintermute, http://humanistinstitute.org/about-us/history/ Educational Programs The Institute's foundation is its independent graduate level program that works in cooperation with existing humanist organizations granting a Certificate in Humanist Studies and Leadership. Students enrolled in the certificate program are provided a unique opportunity to collaborate with a diverse faculty and student body for whom take a non- theistic, naturalistic approach to humanism, whether interpreted in secular or religious terms. They are given a well-founded analytical understanding of humanism as a life-stance acquiring a deep theoretical understanding of humanism across the spectrum and practical application on a personal and professional basis. It is a low-residency distance learning program involving 8 sessions over 2 1/2 years. The curriculum includes: The Humanist Life Stance, Humanist Values & Principles, Humanism in Relation to Others, Essential Humanist Tools (Critical Thinking), Foundation Blocks for Humanism (Physical, Life and Social Sciences), Applying Humanism to Life (Leadership) and Aesthetics & Rituals. In 2012, the Kochhar Online Humanist Education (KOHE) courses were added to the Institute's offerings. KOHE provides an array of self-guided courses introducing individuals to humanism and giving a means to explore at basic level humanist theory and practice. KOHE was the Internet's first website offering interactive courses in humanist thought.Creating Change Through Humanism by Roy Speckhardt, Publisher: The Humanist Press 2015, , 9780931779664http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-04-the-humanist- institute-announces-new-online-course-i In 2014, the Institute launched onsite training programs in conjunction with the Humanist Society, an endorsing organization for Humanist Celebrants across the United States. These trainings help Celebrants learn how to perform weddings, assist in end of life, conduct memorial services and celebrate other important life milestones. Day long workshops were piloted in 2015 as a part of an Educational Series Weekend.

These gestures have become metaphors in , regardless of whether the gesture was actually made. History Natural human behaviour While the exact source of the thumb gesture is obscure, a number of origins have been proposed. Carleton S. Coon, having observed Barbary apes in Gibraltar using the gesture, hypothesised in the anthropological classic The Story of Man that it is a mutual celebration of having opposable thumbs.Carlton S. Coon: \\"The Story of Man\\" (1954) Critics have suggested, however, that the apes may be simply imitating humans.  Ancient Rome  Pollice Verso (1872) by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me is one of the sources of the \\"thumbs down\\" gesture in modern popular culture, but is not based on historical data from Ancient Rome. The Latin phrase pollice verso is used in the context of gladiatorial combat for a hand gesture used by Ancient Roman crowds to pass judgment on a defeated gladiator. While it is clear that the thumb was involved, the precise type of gesture described by the phrase pollice verso and its meaning are unclear in the historical and literary record. According to Anthony Corbeill, a classical studies professor who extensively researched the practice, thumbs up signalled killing the gladiator while \\"a closed fist with a wraparound thumb\\" meant sparing him.Where Does the 'Thumbs-Up' Gesture Really Come From?, Time In modern popular culture, necessarily without a historical basis from Ancient Rome, it is presumed that \\"thumbs down\\" was the signal that a defeated gladiator should be condemned to death; \\"thumbs up\\", that he should be spared.  Middle Ages  It has been suggested that 'thumbs up' was a signal from English archers preparing for battle that all is well with their bow and they are ready to fight. Before use, the fistmele (or the \\"brace height\\") was checked, that being the distance between the string and the bow on an English longbow. This fistmele should be about , which is about the same as a fist with thumb extended. The term fistmele is a Saxon word that refers to that measurement. Desmond Morris in Gestures: Their Origins and Distribution traces the practice back to a medieval custom used to seal business transactions. Over time, the mere sight of an upraised thumb came to symbolize harmony and kind feelings. For an example in the seventeenth century see the Diego Vel√°zquez painting The Lunch.  20th century  A lorry driver giving a thumb sign in Britain, 1940 The Oxford English Dictionary cites the earliest written instance of \\"thumbs-up\\" (with a positive meaning) as being from Over the Top, a 1917 book written by Arthur Guy Empey. Empey was an American who served in the British armed forces during World War I. He wrote: \\"Thumbs up, Tommy‚Äôs expression which means ‚Äòeverything is fine with me'.\\" A visual example of the British use of \\"thumbs up\\" having a positive meaning (or, \\"okay\\") from the 1920s can be seen 19 minutes into the British-made silent 1927 film The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, where the younger man examines some paper money for the older man and declares it \\"good\\" (not counterfeit) with a \\"thumbs up\\" using both hands. Popularization in the United States is generally attributed to the practices of World War II pilots, who used the thumbs up to communicate with ground crews prior to take-off. This custom may have originated with the China-based Flying Tigers, who were among the first American flyers involved in World War II. The appreciative Chinese would say ting hao de (Êå∫Â•ΩÁöÑ) meaning \\"very good\\", and gesture with a thumbs up, which in Chinese means \\"you're number one\\". High officials in the Chinese government see it as a sign of respect. Any person from China will recognize this numerical gesture, and it can be seen in movies and photos of the era, though this has not been verified in print by American Volunteer Group (AVG) pilots. During World War II, pilots on US aircraft carriers adopted the thumbs up gesture to alert the deck crew that they were ready to go and that the wheel chocks could be removed. On modern US carriers, certain deck crew hold a thumb up to signal to the pilot and control tower that their station is OK for take-off. American GIs are reputed to have picked up on the thumb gesture and spread it throughout Europe as they marched toward Berlin. According to Lu√≠s da C√¢mara Cascudo, Brazilians adopted the thumbs up from watching American pilots based in northern Brazil during World War II. Senator John McCain of Arizona, when he cast the deciding vote that derailed a Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act (\\"Obamacare\\") on July 28, 2017, used the thumbs down gesture.  International usage  Somali man giving two thumbs up (with both hands) The thumbs up signal has a generally positive connotation in English-speaking countries. However, its perceived meaning varies significantly from culture to culture. The sign is said to have a pejorative meaning in countries including Iraq and Iran. In Germany, France, and Hungary, the gesture can simply indicate the number one, in the right context. The thumbs up gesture is used on the logo of Thums Up, a popular brand of cola from India. Starting in 2007, the thumbs-up also appeared on India's one-rupee coin. In the United States, American Sign Language users use a single thumb up tilted slightly and rapidly left and right to indicate the number ten (10). When held stationary and thrust toward another person the meaning is \\"yourself\\". When lifted up by the other palm, the meaning is \\"help\\". The handshape is employed in the production of numerous signs in American Sign Language beyond those mentioned here. On the Internet, and most particularly on the social media site Facebook, the thumbs up gesture is shown as an icon and is associated with the term \\"like\\"‚Äîwhich within that context means to follow or subscribe to the page, posts, or profile of another individual or company; and on YouTube, individual videos may be voted on positively or negatively by clicking the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons respectively (which in some previous versions of the site, used to be accompanied by \\"Like\\" and \\"Dislike\\" labels, and are still referred as such nowadays), and in the case of a thumbs-up, the video gets added to the user's \\"Liked videos\\" playlist. See Like button.  Context-specific usage  A typical hitchhiker's thumb gesture A thumb up on Facebook, meaning \\"like\\" More recently, these gestures are associated with movie reviews, having been popularized by critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert on their televised review show Siskel & Ebert‚Äîthe thumb up meaning a positive opinion of a film; the thumb down meaning a negative one. The trademarked phrase \\"two thumbs up\\", originally meaning a positive review from both reviewers, has come to be used as an indication of very high quality or unanimity of praise. A thumb down sign of disapproval By extension from the movie review usage, many websites (including Facebook) allow users to approve or disapprove of items, such as comments in a forum, products in a store, or even other people's reviews of movies, books, products, etc., by choosing to click either a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. In the aggregate, this serves as an evaluation system. Other users may then see the total number of thumbs up and thumbs down given to an item, or may simply see the number which is produced by subtracting thumbs down from thumbs up. (In the latter case, an item which has received exactly ten of each would read as having a rating of zero, rather than one of +10/-10.) Often, users may view a list of items in order of popularity, as ranked by this metric. Hitchhikers in the West traditionally use a thumb gesture to solicit rides from oncoming vehicles, although in this presentation the arm is generally outstretched with the palm and closed fingers facing the motorist. The gesture is usually performed with the hand nearest the motorist and points down the road, indicating the hopeful destination. A hitchhiker may wave the hand, emphasizing the directional meaning. This is similar to the \\"thumb towards the door\\" gesture, for \\"get out of here!\\" In scuba diving, the thumbs-up gesture is a specific diving signal given underwater, in which the diver indicates that he or she is about to stop his or her dive and ascend. This occasionally causes confusion in new divers, who might automatically gesture thumbs-up when trying to indicate approval‚Äîactually indicating a desire to stop diving and to ascend. The diving signal for approval is the A-ok sign. In basketball, when a held ball occurs, an official will jerk both thumbs in the air, signalling that a jump ball is in order. In baseball, umpires will sometimes jerk a thumbs-up over their shoulder as an \\"out\\" signal Amusement park rides such as roller coasters are usually cleared for departure using a thumbs-up signal from the crew after inspection that all safety precautions have been taken. The Indian cola brand Thums Up, now owned by The Coca-Cola Company, is named after this symbol and uses it as its logo. Texas A&M; University uses a thumbs-up as their Gig 'em hand signal, as it represents the action of gigging. The gesture and corresponding slogan \\"Gig 'em, Aggies!\\" were popularized in the early 20th century, becoming the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference.  Unicode  Unicode code points related to thumb signals include: * * *  Other encodings  Many keyboard emoticons utilize the shapes of lowercase \\"b\\" and \\"d\\" to represent a thumbs-up sign. Simple versions incorporate a dash for the wrist: -b (right hand) and d- (left hand). Many Japanese kaomoji icons place the thumbs beside a face constructed from punctuation marks, such as d(ÔºæÔºæ)ÔΩÇ or b(~_^)d.

He is the Scottish father of Indiana Jones and is a professor of medieval studies at Princeton University. Alongside his academic teachings, Jones Sr., is an author of many books and a professional speaker of his historical subject at many conferences throughout the world. His relationship to his son in the franchise is noted as indifferent due to conflicts on their approaches to their situations, despite the fondness they share for history and archaeology. Throughout much of his life, he dedicated his research into the fabled Holy Grail of Christian legends. Alongside appearances in Indiana Jones novels and comic books, the character has featured two stars to portray him in live-action media‚Äîhis debut in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was portrayed by Sean Connery, with a cameo appearance by Alex Hyde- White as the character's younger self during the film's prologue while Connery dubbed his own voice in the scene, and the character's appearance in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series was portrayed by Lloyd Owen.  Characterization  Henry Jones, Sr. (left) and Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones (right) The father of renowned archaeologist Indiana Jones, Henry was born in Scotland on December 12, 1872. He is a professor of medieval literature, having received his degree from the University of Oxford on June 5, 1899 and is, according to his son, \\"the (professor) the students hope they don't get\\".Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) A driven man, Henry is fascinated by the search for the Holy Grail, keeping all the clues he found regarding its whereabouts in his Grail diary. He is apparently a Christian (although his denomination is unclear). He also does not tolerate his son using Jesus' name in vain, slapping the younger Henry across the face when he does so and telling him, \\"That's for blasphemy!\\" Seemingly finding parenting difficult, Henry Sr. mostly bonded with his son through their mutual fascination with history. After the death of his wife Anna from influenza, the gulf between father and son grew to the point where they rarely spoke. Henry claims this was a way of teaching his son \\"self reliance\\", while Indiana felt that his father simply cared more about his intellectual pursuits than about his own son, saying: \\"What you taught me, was that I was less important to you than some people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country.\\" When Henry explains that the search for the Grail is \\"a race against evil\\", Indy lashes out at him: \\"This is an obsession, Dad! I never understood it! Never!\\" To Indiana's constant exasperation, Henry refers to his son only as \\"Junior\\" until the end of The Last Crusade, when he finally relents and calls him \\"Indiana\\" when he convinces him to let the Grail go. (Indiana later calls his own son \\"Junior\\".) Another factor which deteriorated Indiana and Henry's relationship was Indiana going off to enlist in the Belgian Army for World War I in 1916 without his father's consent, and the two went three years without seeing each other. Because of his father's aloofness, Indy embraced his father's friend Marcus Brody as a father figure and role model. His father's distant nature may have influenced Indiana's own reluctance to settle down and start a family. For much of Indiana's life, Henry disapproves of his son's frequent resort to violence, considering it unworthy of a scholar. When Indy guns down a pair of Nazis, Henry exclaims \\"Look what you did! I can't believe what you did!\\" However, during their motorcycle escape, he is impressed when his son defeats their Nazi pursuers using a flagpole like a jousting lance. Rather than physical confrontation, Henry prefers more elegant expedients, such as when he flaps his umbrella at a flock of seagulls, sending them into the engines of a pursuing Nazi fighter plane. When Indy punches a Nazi during the final tank battle, Henry shouts, \\"You call this archaeology?!\\" But at last, Henry blows up a truck full of Nazis to Brody's horror, explaining \\"It's war!\\" Henry suffers from fear of rats (musophobia), similar to his son's fear of snakes, and apparently also from acrophobia.The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, American Broadcasting Company, \\"Athens, 1910\\", 1996-06-16 He has a habit of saying \\"This is intolerable!\\" in particularly trying circumstances. As revealed in the Indiana Jones Ultimate Guide, Henry Jones, Sr. died in 1951.  Appearances  In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, set in 1938, Walter Donovan finds a tablet that provides new clues to the Grail's location, he hires Henry to lead an expedition to locate the artifact. While on the expedition, he discovers that his colleague (Elsa Schneider, also Henry's and later Indy's paramour) is working for the Nazis. Henry mails his Grail diary, with its many vital clues, to his son for safekeeping ‚Äî shortly afterwards he (while working in a Venetian library) is captured by Nazi officials and interned in Brunwald Castle on the Austrian border. He is eventually rescued from the castle by his son, and they learn that Donovan is also working with the Nazis. Henry convinces Indiana that the Grail must not be taken by the Nazis and that they need to go to Berlin to reclaim his Grail diary to complete the quest. During the course of the adventure, Marcus is captured and when Indiana goes to battle the Nazis, Henry tries to rescue Marcus himself. During the course of the battle, Henry blows up a truck full of Nazis, saving Indiana's life. Eventually, working together, Marcus and Henry manage to escape the tank they're trapped in. When Indy nearly falls to his death off a cliff after fighting Nazis on a tank, Henry is horrified when he thinks his son has died, and is greatly relieved when Indy reveals himself to be alive and well. Henry is shot by Donovan in the film's climax, but Indiana finds the Grail in time and uses it to heal his wounds. Henry returns the favor by rescuing Indiana from a rift (created when Elsa crosses a seal with the Grail), imploring his son to let the Grail go, even calling him by his nickname \\"Indiana\\" for the first time and implying that he cares more about Indiana than the Grail. In The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, following the publication of a successful book on chivalry in 1909, Jones is invited to speak at a number of schools and universities around the world. He took his wife and son along with him, hiring his former tutor, Helen Seymour (portrayed by Margaret Tyzack) to tutor his son. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Henry is hinted to have died prior to the events of the film. A framed photograph of him is seen on Indy's desk at one point in the film. Near the end of the movie, Indy addresses Mutt as \\"Junior\\". In the James Rollins novelization of the movie, it is said that Henry Jones, Sr., had died roughly two years before, making his year of death between 1955 and 1956. However, in the James Luceno DK book, Indiana Jones the Ultimate Guide, it lists his death as 1951. According to a video on the official website for the video game, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, Henry will be a playable character in a storyline specially created for co-op mode, which follows Henry Sr. and Henry Jr. as they travel to South America to prevent priceless artifacts from falling into the hands of the Germans. Henry Sr. and Henry Jr. make very brief unplayable cameos in the video game Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars. Their appearance pays tribute to a scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  Conception  Steven Spielberg chose to introduce Indiana's father in the third film, as he found the Holy Grail an unspectacular plot device. Sean Connery was the obvious choice to play the role for him, as James Bond was an inspiration for Indiana. George Lucas and Harrison Ford were surprised, though. Ford explained Connery (born in 1930), was only twelve years older than he was.Gregory Peck was also considered for the role of Jones Sr. Connery enhanced the character, who was conceived as more bookish. He came up with the line \\"She talks in her sleep\\" while filming, which caused the crew to ruin the take as they found it so funny. To prepare for the role in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Lloyd Owen prepared by watching numerous Connery films and studied his accent. Owen shared the character's love of medieval history, having studied Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale. Owen considered the character \\"a good father. I think that's obvious by the way Indy has turned out. He even said in the film that he's not the kind of father that says, 'Eat your food, go to bed, brush your teeth!' He's not that kind of guy at all. He's a very liberal parent for the 1900s.\\" Connery turned down a cameo appearance in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), as he was enjoying retirement too much. In a statement, he provided one last piece of advice for \\"Junior\\" ‚Äì keep the cliffs low, the monsters CGI and the whip close at hand to fend off the stunt coordinator. George Lucas said in hindsight that it was good Connery did not appear, as it would disappoint the audience when his character did not join the film's adventure. Ford joked, \\"I'm old enough to play my own father.\\"  Reception  Sean Connery received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. Horizon released a vinyl model kit of Henry in 1993, which the buyer could assemble. The Japanese company Kotobukiya released a vinyl kit in 2008. That same year, Hasbro released a 3 ¬æ-inch action figure that comes with his suitcase, umbrella and the Holy Grail; a die-cast model of him and Indiana in the motorcycle; and a Mighty Mugg (caricature) toy. Lego also made a Henry figure for its playset based on the motorcycle chase and the airplane fight.

History Gungabula (also known as Kongabula and Khungabula) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range. Ludwig Leichhardt explored the area in 1844 and named the river in honour of Robert Dawson, one of Leichhardt's financial backers. In the 1920s, shortly after the First World War, Australian Labor Party politician Ted Theodore (1884-1950) launched an irrigation program on the Dawson River for returning soldiers. His intentions was to provide them with arable land along the river for them to take up farming, thus eschewing a post-war recession. After the 1922 Irrigation Act was passed, he started irrigation schemes on the Dawson River, for an initial 8,000 new farmers. However, the scheme was abandoned after he realized the soil was unsuitable for farming and the returning soldiers had no agrarian skills.

The importance of such functions lies in the fact that their function space is similar to spaces, but its members are not required to satisfy any growth restriction on their behavior at the boundary of their domain (at infinity if the domain is unbounded): in other words, locally integrable functions can grow arbitrarily fast at the domain boundary, but are still manageable in a way similar to ordinary integrable functions.

An alternative definition .See for example . Let be an open set in the Euclidean space .

This definition has its roots in the approach to measure and integration theory based on the concept of continuous linear functional on a topological vector space, developed by Nicolas Bourbaki and his school:This approach was praised by who remarked also its usefulness, however using to define locally integrable functions. it is also the one adopted by and by .Be noted that Maz'ya and Shaposhnikova define explicitly only the \\"localized\\" version of the Sobolev space , nevertheless explicitly asserting that the same method is used to define localized versions of all other Banach spaces used in the cited book: in particular, is introduced on page 44.

The case is trivial, therefore in the sequel of the proof it is assumed that .

Every function f in L_{p,loc}(\\\\Omega), 1, is locally integrable, i. e. belongs to L_{1,loc}(\\\\Omega) . Note: If \\\\Omega is an open subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n that is also bounded, then one has the standard inclusion L_p(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset L_1(\\\\Omega) which makes sense given the above inclusion L_1(\\\\Omega)\\\\subset L_{1,loc}(\\\\Omega). But the first of these statements is not true if \\\\Omega is not bounded; then it is still true that L_p(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset L_{1,loc}(\\\\Omega) for any p, but not that L_p(\\\\Omega)\\\\subset L_1(\\\\Omega) . To see this, one typically considers the function u(x)=1 , which is in L_{\\\\infty}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) but not in L_p(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) for any finite p.  L1,loc is the space of densities of absolutely continuous measures . A function is the density of an absolutely continuous measure if and only if f\\\\in L_{1,loc}. The proof of this result is sketched by . Rephrasing its statement, this theorem asserts that every locally integrable function defines an absolutely continuous measure and conversely that every absolutely continuous measures defines a locally integrable function: this is also, in the abstract measure theory framework, the form of the important Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem given by Stanis≈Çaw Saks in his treatise.According to , \\"If is a set of finite measure, or, more generally the sum of a sequence of sets of finite measure ('), then, in order that an additive function of a set () on be absolutely continuous on , it is necessary and sufficient that this function of a set be the indefinite integral of some integrable function of a point of \\". Assuming () to be the Lebesgue measure, the two statements can be seen to be equivalent.

More generally, constants, continuous functionsSee for example . and integrable functions are locally integrable.See . *The function f(x) = 1/x for x ‚àà (0, 1) is locally but not globally integrable on (0, 1). It is locally integrable since any compact set K ‚äÜ (0, 1) has positive distance from 0 and f is hence bounded on K. This example underpins the initial claim that locally integrable functions do not require the satisfaction of growth conditions near the boundary in bounded domains. * The function :: f(x)= \\\\begin{cases} 1/x &x; eq 0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x=0, \\\\end{cases} \\\\quad x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R : is not locally integrable in : it is indeed locally integrable near this point since its integral over every compact set not including it is finite.

The answer is negative, and a counterexample is provided by the following function: :: f(x)= \\\\begin{cases} e^{1/x} &x; eq 0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x=0, \\\\end{cases} : does not define any distribution on ‚Ñù.See . * The following example, similar to the preceding one, is a function belonging to (‚Ñù \\\\ 0) which serves as an elementary counterexample in the application of the theory of distributions to differential operators with irregular singular coefficients: :: f(x)= \\\\begin{cases} k_1 e^{1/x^2} &x;>0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x=0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ k_2 e^{1/x^2} &x;<0, \\\\end{cases} :where and are complex constants, is a general solution of the following elementary non-Fuchsian differential equation of first order ::x^3\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}f}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}+2f=0. :Again it does not define any distribution on the whole ‚Ñù, if or are not zero: the only distributional global solution of such equation is therefore the zero distribution, and this shows how, in this branch of the theory of differential equations, the methods of the theory of distributions cannot be expected to have the same success achieved in other branches of the same theory, notably in the theory of linear differential equations with constant coefficients.For a brief discussion of this example, see .  Applications  Locally integrable functions play a prominent role in distribution theory and they occur in the definition of various classes of functions and function spaces, like functions of bounded variation. Moreover, they appear in the Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem by characterizing the absolutely continuous part of every measure.

It deals with Brown's guilt and anxiety over his obsessive masturbation to Playboy Playmate models. The story begins with Brown's first purchase of an issue of Playboy as a teenager. His obsessive masturbating gives him great guilt and anxiety, and out of fear of being caught he repeatedly rids himself of copies of the magazine, only to retrieve them later. His conflicting emotions follow him into adulthood until he purges them by revealing himself through his comics. The free, organic arrangement of odd-shaped panels of simple, expressive artwork contrasts with Brown's more detailed grid-like pages in his 1980s work, such as Ed the Happy Clown. The Playboy forms part of Brown's early-1990s autobiographical period, and was the first book-length work he planned as a complete story. Brown conceived it as a longer work with what became his next graphic novel, I Never Liked You (1994), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. The story has attracted praise for its revealing honesty and criticism from those who saw it as glorifying pornography. Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner wrote Brown to express concern over Brown's sexual anxieties in a post-sexual revolution world. Background Chester Brown grew up in Ch√¢teauguay, a Montreal suburb with a large English-speaking minority; he does not speak French. He described himself as a \\"nerdy teenager\\" attracted to comic books from a young age. He sought a career drawing superhero comics, but was unsuccessful in finding work with Marvel or DC after graduating from high school. He moved to Toronto and discovered and the small-press community. He began to self-publish a minicomic in 1983 titled Yummy Fur. From 1986 Toronto- based Vortex Comics began publishing Yummy Fur. After making a name for himself in alternative comics with the surreal serial Ed the Happy Clown, Brown turned to autobiography after reading such work by Julie Doucet and Joe Matt. The work of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired Brown to pare down his drawing style during the early 1990s. He tentatively began his autobiographical period with a pair of short tales, and gradually became freer with his panel layouts and simpler in his artwork. Content The autobiographical story takes place in Chester \\"Chet\\" Brown's hometown of Ch√¢teauguay in 1975, when Brown was 15. It details his obsession with the Playmates in Playboy magazine. Brown's character obsessively masturbates in secret, terrified of being found out, but unable to resist the urge. Afterwards he feels guilty and sometimes rids himself of the magazines, only to retrieve them. As an adult, he sometimes repurchases copies of issues he had discarded. The story takes place primarily during Brown's adolescence and finishes at the time of the book's creation. Brown uses a bat-winged figure with his own face to narrate the story and goad Chet in a way similar to the trope of the angel and devil on the shoulders. Chet never acknowledges the narrator, who appears to be visible only to the reader. The narrator talks about Brown in the third person in the adolescent parts of the story, but in the first person in Brown's adult years. Synopsis The story opens in church, where the winged narrator cajoles the adolescent Chet to buy a Playboy magazine he had seen for sale. Chet works up the courage to buy it at a convenience store a considerable distance from his house, in the hope that no one will see him there. After bringing it home and masturbating to it, he disposes of the magazine by hiding it under a plank of wood in the woods near his house. His building obsession battles his guilt, and eventually he returns for it, a situation which repeats itself throughout the story. His obsession so overcomes him that, even when his mother dies while he is at camp, his first thought at returning home is to retrieve the Playboy he has hidden in the woods. As an adult, he hunts down back issues and memorizes dates and names of Playmate models, and disposes of them over the guilt he feels or his fear of being found out by a girlfriend. His obsession interferes with his relations with women: he relates that, while seeing one girlfriend, he could only maintain an erection for her by fantasizing about his favourite Playmates, and that he preferred masturbation to having sex with her. The Playboy finishes with Brown drawing the story in progress. Though he knows his friends shortly will read it, he still feels uncomfortable discussing it with them. Style and analysis Chet's winged companion goads him to buy an issue of Playboy By the end of the 1980s Brown had grown dissatisfied with his drawing style. He began simplifying it after bringing Ed the Happy Clown to an end, as he had been reading work by cartoonists with simpler styles such as John Stanley and Brown's friend Seth. He abandoned the grid layout that he had used and arranged panels on the page in a varied, organic manner. He made the drawings first and only afterwards laid down panel borders, which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclose and are in a wobbly free-hand‚Äîmuch like those of the Hernandez brothers or Robert Crumb. Brown distorted his images to convey emotion, but not in traditional cartoonish ways. For example, when the adolescent Brown encounters friends of his parents, he does not physically shrink with embarrassment, but does so through distortion of perspective. Chet is introverted and self-isolating, preferring pornography to communicating with others, such as his brother. Chet takes centre stage in the narrative, and supporting characters make but brief appearances. Brown depicts Chet's obsessive masturbation, and his uncommon masturbation style has drawn notice: he faces down and rubs his penis between the palms of both hands, a style Marcy R. Isabella likens to a pair of praying hands. The style has come to be called \\"the Chester\\" after a cartoon of it by Peter Bagge. He feels terrified of being caught masturbating and his regret afterwards drives him continually to rid himself of the magazines, such as by hiding them in the woods near his house, but always returns for them. Brown's mother dies while he is at camp, which is mentioned only briefly, as when he returns from camp he immediately heads to the woods to dig up the Playboy he had buried there. Comics critic Darcy Sullivan sees Brown in this scene having \\"shunted aside his painful feelings for her, and for other women, in favor of this tatty fetish\\". Chet feels surprised at and repelled by a centrefold of a black Playmate he comes across, bringing about the realization of racist feelings he has. Peter Bagge does \\"The Chester\\" When finishing The Playboy, Brown felt guilt over still looking at Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown it is about the guilt he was made to feel for using the media. Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. Brown has objected to this interpretation‚Äîrather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women. Critic Darcy Sullivan saw the book as presenting how Brown's Playboy obsession affects his ability to relate to women. Sullivan called The Playboy stories \\"[t]he most honest sex in comics\\" of the early 1990s, \\"and the most damning expos√© of pornography\\" as it deals \\"with nothing more than Brown's relationship with Playboy\\". He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller over the course of The Playboy, and for the believability of scenes which may or may not have happened as Brown depicted them. While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns, Brown depicts himself as \\"a victim of his urges\\", and that \\"Playboy has kept him mentally separate\\". Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. Brown's comics raise questions, rather than trying to answer them, an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal. Publication Brown had run into problems doing autobiographical stories of his contemporary life, as his story interconnected with the stories of those around him‚Äîthe friends he portrayed did not always agree with the way he pictured them. He portrays his friend Kris's negative reaction in \\"Showing Helder\\" to his depiction of her in \\"Helder\\". Brown turned to tales of his teenage years, as he had lost contact with most of those he knew from that time. Brown stated that he intended a longer story encompassing what ended up in The Playboy and the following graphic novel, I Never Liked You (1994), but when planning it he found it was too complex. He said he had a clear idea of the stories from his life that he would use, and the general shape of the narrative, but he had a \\"sense of improvising\\" as he did not script it out beforehand. The serialization appeared under the title Disgust in issues 21‚Äì23 of Yummy Fur, at the time published by Vortex Comics. With the twenty-fifth issue of Yummy Fur in 1991, Brown switched publishers to the Montreal-based Drawn and Quarterly, who published a collected and revised edition of The Playboy in 1992; this was the first graphic novel from the publisher. Brown rescripted, relettered, and reformatted the book for an annotated edition in 2013, also from Drawn and Quarterly. Reception and legacy The story gained praise from fans, critics, and other cartoonists, and earned a Harvey Award nomination in 1991 for Best Single Issue or Story. The Playboy, I Never Liked You, and several shorter pieces placed No. 38 on The Comics Journals list of the best 100 English-language comics of the 20th century as \\"The autobiographical comics from Yummy Fur\\". Cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez asserted, \\"The Playboy and I Never Liked You are probably the best graphic novels next to Maus\\". Critic Frank Young called it a \\"pivotal work\\" in the autobiographical comics trend of the early 1990s. Critic Darcy Sullivan considered it required reading for those who are serious about comics and a \\"landmark look at an artist's growth\\", referring to the pace with which Brown's work matured over the course of the three issues of its serialization. Brown stated that several women took offense at the book, saying it glorified pornography. Hugh Hefner sent Brown a letter after The Playboys publication, showing concern that someone who grew up during the sexual revolution could still suffer such confusion and anxiety. Darcy Sullivan compared the pornography-obsessed autobiographical work of Joe Matt in Peepshow unfavourably to The Playboy in an issue of The Comics Journal, to which Brown responded with a defence of Matt's work in a later issue. Brown's attitudes towards pornography have since changed greatly. When he made The Playboy he was struggling with his embarrassment over buying pornography; two decades later he vocally advocated for the decriminalization of prostitution in Paying for It (2011).

It was originally known as the Lakes District Tribal Council. The CSTC was incorporated in 1979 and is a registered non-profit society.  Member governments  Its current members are: * Nadleh Whut'en First Nation * Nak'azdli Indian Band * Saik'uz First Nation * Stellat'en First Nation * Takla Lake First Nation * Tl'azt'en Nation * Ts'il Kaz Koh First Nation (formerly known as Burns Lake Indian Band) * Wet'suwet'en First Nation (formerly known as Broman Lake Band or Broman Lake Indian Band) Not all Carrier or Sekani bands belong to CSTC. Three Blackwater Carrier bands, Ulkatcho Indian Band, Lhoosk'us Dene, and Red Bluff Indian Band, belong to Carrier-Chilcotin Tribal Council. Other bands, such as the Cheslatta Carrier Nation and the Lheidli T'enneh in the Prince George area, are independent. Chief and councillors CSTC is governed by a chief, elected at large by the individual members, and a council consisting of one representative of each of the member bands. Social services are provided by Carrier Sekani Family Services, a now separate organization spun off by CSTC. The Yinka Dene Language Institute, charged with linguistic and cultural matters, is indirectly controlled by CSTC, which appoints the majority of its board of directors.  Treaty process  In January 1994, the CSTC entered the treaty process. By April 1997, they had reached Stage 4 of the six-stage process - negotiation of an agreement in principle. The CSTC borrowed $14 million (CAN) from the government to resolve grievances regarding unceded territories. By 2007, negotiations reached a deadlock. In her report to Parliament in December 2006, Auditor General Sheila Fraser, noted that the financial burden placed on First Nations when negotiations are drawn out, are among the factors that have led some First Nations to use litigation or other options for settling land claims. DINA's process was complex, inflexible and slow. In March 2007 during a Treaty Forum hosted by the CSTC that provided an opportunity for the Membership to listen to the Governments and the British Columbia Treaty Commission officials, the CSTC made the historic decision to vote to abandon treaty negotiations because the British Columbia Treaty Process had failed to produce expected results in Carrier territory. Mandate The CSTC focuses on issues related to Carrier & Sekani heritage and identity, self-government, land claims, standard of living, social and economic independence and public relations on behalf of member nations.  History  CSTC has at times included other bands. Lake Babine Nation band left CSTC in 1991. Lheidli T'enneh left in 1992. Burns Lake Band withdrew in 1993\\"Band Separates from Tribal Council,\\" Yinka Dene, June‚ÄìJuly 1993, p. 7 but subsequently returned. In 2006 the CSTC commissioned and oversaw the Aboriginal Interest and Use Study (AIUS) to investigate impacts of the Enbridge oil pipeline proposal. In October 2010 the Supreme Court ruled against the tribal council in CSTC vs. Rio Tinto Alcan. The court ruled that nobody was obligated to come to First Nations to consult on the issue of the Electricity Purchase Agreement (EPA) structured between BC Hydro and Alcan. However, the high court noted that, \\"The Kenny Dam was built without consultation and at the time, CSTC or its member nations were not permitted to hire a lawyer under the Indian Act. That said, the project itself was built without consultation and the Supreme Court now says First Nations can receive compensation on the lack of consultation.\\" The CSTC had claimed that, \\"[i]n the 1950s, the government of British Columbia authorized the building of a dam and reservoir which altered the amount and timing of water flows in the Nechako River. The First Nations claim the Nechako Valley as their ancestral homeland, and the right to fish in the Nechako River, but, pursuant to the practice at the time, they were not consulted about the dam project.\\"  Demographics  The estimated total number of CSTC members was 25,682 in 2004 according to DINA.  Social, educational and cultural programs and facilities  In addition to representing its members in treaty negotiations with British Columbia and Canada and in various other dealings, CSTC provides technical andprofessional services to its members in such areas as fisheries, education, economic development, community and infrastructure planning, forestry, and financial management.

The story first ran between 1991 and 1993 under the title Fuck, in issues of Brown's comic book Yummy Fur; published in book form by Drawn and Quarterly in 1994. It deals with the teenage Brown's introversion and difficulty talking to others, especially members of the opposite sex‚Äîincluding his mother. The story has minimal dialogue and is sparsely narrated. The artwork is amongst the simplest in Brown's body of work‚Äîsome pages consist only of a single small panel. Brown established his reputation in the early alternative comics scene of the 1980s with the surreal, taboo-breaking Ed the Happy Clown. He brought that story to an abrupt end in 1989 when, excited by the autobiographical comics of Joe Matt and Julie Doucet, he turned towards personal stories. The uncomplicated artwork of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired him to simplify his own. Brown intended I Never Liked You as part of a longer work with what became his previous book, The Playboy (1992), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. I Never Liked You was the last work of Brown's early autobiographical period. I Never Liked You was well received, and its influence can be found in the work of cartoonists such as Jeffrey Brown, Ariel Schrag and Anders Nilsen. The book appeared amid the early 1990s trend in autobiographical alternative comics, and Brown was one of a prominent trio of Toronto-based autobiographical cartoonists, with Seth and Joe Matt. Brown originally set the panels against black page backgrounds, which he replaced with white for an annotated \\"New Definitive Edition\\" in 2002. Background Brown grew up in Ch√¢teauguay, a Montreal suburb with a large English-speaking minority; he does not speak French. He described himself as a \\"nerdy teenager\\" attracted to comic books from a young age, and sought a career in superhero comics, but was unsuccessful in finding work with Marvel or DC after graduating from high school. He moved to Toronto and discovered and the small-press community. From 1983 he self-published a minicomic titled Yummy Fur. Seth a fellow Toronto cartoonist whose work inspired Brown to simplify his own. From 1986 Toronto-based Vortex Comics began publishing Yummy Fur. After making a name for himself in alternative comics with the surreal serial Ed the Happy Clown, Brown turned to autobiography under the influence of the work of Julie Doucet and Joe Matt. During his autobiographical period, Brown gradually simplified his style, inspired by the example of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth. He began tentatively with a pair of short tales, and gradually became freer with his panel layouts and simpler in his artwork. Brown had switched publishers to the Montreal-based Drawn and Quarterly by the time he completed his first autobiographical graphic novel, The Playboy, in 1992. At first, he intended The Playboy and I Never Liked You to form one story, but found it too complex to handle when he started to plan it out. The Playboy deals with Brown's guilt over his teenage obsession with masturbating over pornography. The book gained praise from fans, critics, and other cartoonists, and won a Harvey Award. It received criticism from those who saw it as objectifying women and glorifying pornography; Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner wrote to Brown voicing concern that Brown would feel such guilt in a post-sexual revolution world. Synopsis The story is set during Brown's 1970s adolescence in Ch√¢teauguay, a suburb of Montreal. Chester‚Äî\\"Chet\\" for short‚Äîis a thin, long-haired teenager who is awkward, introverted, and better able to express himself through drawing than speaking. He constantly and inexplicably turns away girls, even though he is interested in them and they in him. Except in his imagination, Chet has difficulty expressing affection even for his mother. She talks to Chet and his younger brother Gord about issues that embarrass them, and the religious teaching she has instilled in them has rendered Chet unable to bring himself to swear, for which he is teased and goaded at school. Chet plays games such as hide-and-seek with the neighbourhood children. One girl, Carrie, has a crush on Chet and invites him to her house each day to wash the dishes. He and Carrie's older sister Connie, a bossy blonde a year his senior, often hide during hide-and-seek games in tall grass where they spend the time talking with each other, though they have little in common. Connie asks him to the movies, but he sits away from her when he spots boys from his school; he fears he will be teased for being on a date. When the film ends, they walk home in silence. Chet is interested in Sky, a large-breasted dark-haired girl two years younger who lives next door, about whom he has masturbatory fantasies. He confesses his love but immediately regrets it, unable to express his feelings. She connects with Chet and tries to develop a relationship, but he is unable to deal with his emotions and avoids spending time with her. He draws her a picture of a skeleton symbolizing himself reaching for a bird signifying Sky herself. When Carrie deciphers it correctly he denies that he uses symbolism in his drawings, and the confrontation escalates to minor violence when Carrie proclaims to him, \\"I never liked you!\\" Chet and his brother rarely visit their mother after she checks into hospital, and when they do Chet cannot bring himself to tell her he loves her. She suffers a fall down a flight of stairs there when confusedly wandering around and dies after being bedridden and incoherent for a short time. Chet makes excuse after excuse to turn Sky away when she tries to spend time with him. The story ends with Chet refusing to accompany Sky to the fair because he says he would rather listen to his new Kiss album. Publication I Never Liked You was originally serialized under the title Fuck, in issues #26‚Äì30 of Yummy Fur, between October 1991 and April 1993. Unlike his earlier works, according to Brown there was \\"very little improvisation in I Never Liked You. It was quite planned out, even if I didn't write a full script.\\" Drawn and Quarterly issued a collected edition in 1994, changing the title from Fuck to I Never Liked You. Brown rearranged the page layouts, removing panels, most significantly those in the prologue where Chet explains his motivations. A \\"New Definitive Edition\\" appeared in 2002, with two added pages of contextual endnotes, something he had been increasingly doing from 1995 with his cartoon essay \\"My Mom Was a Schizophrenic\\". In the 1994 collection the backgrounds were black; he changed them to white and rearranged the panels for the \\"New Definitive Edition\\". He explained: \\"I like austerity. The white background looks more austere to me.\\" The edition included a short appendix for readers \\"wondering when and where things happened\\". Brown announced in Louis Riel 7 a recall of the first 600 copies of the edition, citing that the paper it was printed on was too transparent. The recalled copies also had a panel captioned \\"I decide to say nothing\\"; the caption did not appear in copies that were not recalled. Style and analysis Academic Charles Hatfield finds \\"an abiding interest in the ways people are shaped by their environment\\" in Brown's autobiographical work, and believes the stories demonstrate \\"the urgency of Justin Green and the mundane particularity of Harvey Pekar\\", two influential creators known for their revealing autobiographical comics. Brown is unsparing in his depictions of social awkwardness of his teenage years. Despite the 1970s adolescent backdrop, sex and drugs are absent; his life is shaped by his strictly religious parents and introversion. identification. Brown's mother (1923‚Äì76) suffered from schizophrenia. This is not made explicit, but hinted at in scenes where she approaches awkward subjects with Chet and his brother Gord; the boys' unsupportive responses feed the discomfort. Brown addresses his mother's mental health in his 1995 cartoon essay \\"My Mom Was a Schizophrenic\\", in which he takes an anti-psychiatric stance. Chet's face is near expressionless throughout. The characters are distanced from the reader, inviting neither empathy nor identification. To cartoonist and critic Pepo P√©rez, this is a challenge to readers to understand the characters. In the appendix to the \\"New Definitive Edition\\", Brown declares the dialogue is filtered through his memory and likely did not occur as recorded, and that locations and other details are also subject to lapses of memory. To academic Elisabeth El Refaie this transparency on Brown's part is \\"a deeper and more sincere form of authenticity\\". Reviewer C. Max Magee found the tone of awkwardness and emotional emptiness comparable to works by contemporaries such as Daniel Clowes and Chris Ware. The story unfolds in vignettes, with little setup or context given to any scene. To Hatfield, they \\"[pop] out of nowhere as a dreamlike series of pulses ... The effect is sometimes eerie ... despite the grounding of the story in mundane everyday stuff.\\" Unlike in his previous graphic novel, The Playboy, Brown makes limited use of a narrator in I Never Liked You. The story is told almost entirely through its pictures and sparse dialogue. The page layouts are also sparse, sometimes limited to a single, small panel on a page, sometimes up to seven or eight. The layout and repetition of panels affects pacing, slowing or quickening scene. Brown abandoned the grid layout he had used in earlier works for more varied, organic layouts. Backgrounds establish the mood of a scene, harmonizing or contrasting with the action‚Äîas when Chet and Connie return from the movies amongst a romantic snow-covered, starry landscape, against an awkward silence accentuated by panel that grow, making the figures appear ever more insignificant. The cartooning is far looser than in Brown's earlier work, and concerned more with gesture and expression than literal detail. They are rendered with a brush, and amongst the simplest and sparsest in his body of work. There is nonetheless a significant amount of hatching, and the backgrounds are naturalistic, in contrast to the thin, distorted figures. Brown had been paring his artwork since the Playboy stories, as he was not happy with his style and sought \\"to rebuild style in a way that would like\\". He continued this with I Never Liked You, where he has said he was \\"trying to get even more pared down than The Playboy\\". Certain inanimate objects receive a focus imbuing them with special significance, such as Chet's habitual after- school package of soda crackers or the Brown family home‚Äîa house that, to reviewer Darcy Sullivan, \\"is as much a character as in The Playboy\\". Brown drew the pictures before laying down the panel borders, which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclosed and are drawn in a wobbly free-hand much like in the artwork of the Los Bros Hernandez or Robert Crumb. He drew each panel individually, assembling them into pages afterwards. In the original serialization and first collected edition, they were placed on black backgrounds. He changed to white backgrounds for the 2002 edition. Reception and legacy Brown (pictured in 2009) returned to the subject of his relations with women in 2011 in the polemic Paying for It, arguing for the decriminalization of prostitution. Brown's autobiographical work developed from a scene that had been developing since the 1970s and which had reached a peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Brown's open and self-deprecating example left an impact on cartoonists such as Jeffrey Brown and Ariel Schrag, and his sparse layouts on the likes of Anders Nilsen. Upon the serial's conclusion, reviewer Darcy Sullivan called it \\"a major step forward for the artist, a leading light in adult comics\\". American cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez hailed The Playboy and I Never Liked You as \\"probably the best graphic novels next to Maus\\"; British cartoonist Eddie Campbell called them \\"the most sensitive comics ever made\\"; and American comics writer Heidi MacDonald called I Never Liked You \\"a masterpiece\\" that is \\"the equal of any 'coming of age' movie\\". Charles Hatfield praised Brown's honesty, keen observation, and narrative strength, and called the \\"hide with me\\" page as one of his favourites. Critic described the work as \\"an example of sobriety and restraint, and one of the harshest, most hopeless teenage portraits ... in any medium\\".

Alongside Seth's It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken and Joe Matt's The Poor Bastard‚Äîworks by Brown's Toronto-based friends and Drawn and Quarterly stablemates‚ÄîI Never Liked You is seen as a prominent example of the 1990s autobiographical comics trend. As one of \\"The Autobiographical Stories from Yummy Fur\\", it ranked 38th on The Comics Journals list of the top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century. In 2001 Stephen Weiner included I Never Liked You in his book The 101 Best Graphic Novels, recommending it to those who enjoy J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye. I Never Liked You was the last work from his autobiographical period that started in 1990 with Helder in Yummy Fur #19. Yummy Fur continued for two more issues before Drawn and Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros convinced Brown to publish his next serial, Underwater, under its own title in 1994. In 2011 Brown returned to autobiography and his relations with women with the graphic novel Paying for It, a polemic arguing for the decriminalization of prostitution.

History ASCOM was invented in late 1997 and early 1998 by Bob Denny, when he released two commercial programs and several freeware utilities that showcased the technology. He also induced Doug George to include ASCOM capabilities in commercial CCD camera control software. The first observatory to adopt ASCOM was Junk Bond Observatory, in early 1998. It was used at this facility to implement a robotic telescope dedicated to observing asteroids. The successful use of ASCOM there was covered in an article in Sky & Telescope magazine. This helped ASCOM to become more widely adopted. The ASCOM standards were placed under the control of the ASCOM Initiative, a group of astronomy software developers who volunteered to develop the standards further. Under the influence of Denny, George, Tim Long, and others, ASCOM developed into a set of device driver standards. In 2004, over 150 astronomy-related devices were supported by ASCOM device drivers, which were released as freeware. Most of the drivers are also open source. As ASCOM developed, the term became less associated with the Component Object Model, and has been used more broadly to describe not only the standards and software based on them, but also to describe an observing system architecture and a robotic telescope design philosophy. In 2004, ASCOM remained formally a reference to the Component Object Model, but the term is expected to stand on its own as new technologies such as Microsoft .NET take over functions provided by the Component Object Model, and additional ASCOM projects are adopted that dilute its concentration on device drivers. The release of version 6 of the ASCOM Platform in June 2011 marked a transition to an open source development paradigm, with several developers contributing to the effort and all of the platform source code being made available under a Creative Commons license. Initially, the Platform developer team used servers hosted by TiGra Networks (Long's IT consulting company) for source code control, issue tracking and project management, with server licenses contributed by Atlassian and JetBrains. In 2012, due in part to differences in development style, TiGra Networks' involvement with the software development effort ceased and the source code was relocated to SourceForge. What is it? The Ascom Platform is a collection of computer drivers for different astronomy-related devices. It uses agreed standards that allow different computer programs ('apps') and devices to communicate with each other simultaneously. This means that you can have things like mounts, focusers, cameras and filter wheels all controlled by a single computer, even with several computers sharing access to those resources. For example, you can use one program to find targets and another to guide your telescope, with both of them sharing control of your mount at the same time. An ASCOM driver acts as an abstraction layer between the client and hardware thus removing any hardware dependency in the client, and making the client automatically compatible with all devices that supports the minimum required properties and methods. For example, this abstraction allows an ASCOM client to use an imaging device without needing to know whether the device is attached via a serial or network connection. ASCOM defines a collection of required Properties and Methods that ASCOM compliant software can use to communicate with an ASCOM compliant device. ASCOM also defines a range of optional Properties and Methods to take advantage of common features that may not be available for every manufacturer's device. By testing various properties an ASCOM client application can determine what features are available for use. Properties and Methods are accessible via scripting interfaces, allowing control of devices by standard scripting applications such as VBScript and Javascript. In fact any language that supports access to Microsoft COM objects can interface with ASCOM. An ASCOM Platform software package is available for download which installs some common libraries and documentation as well as a collection of ASCOM drivers for a broad range of equipment. Additional ASCOM drivers for devices not included in the ASCOM Platform package can be downloaded and installed separately. Although ASCOM is predominantly used by the amateur community, because the standard is freely available it is also used in some professional installations. Licensing There are no particular licensing requirements other than that the ASCOM logo may only be used if the client application is ASCOM compatible, and an ASCOM driver must implement all the required properties and methods (but need not implement any of the optional properties and methods). End user From an astronomer's point of view, it is a simple matter of installing the ASCOM platform and suitable client software; no programming is required. ASCOM drivers allow computer- based control of devices such as planetarium software to direct a telescope to point at a selected object. Using a combination of mount, focuser and imaging device ASCOM drivers, it is possible to build a fully automated environment for deep sky imaging. Developer Developers can enhance the power of ASCOM by writing their own clients using the scripting or object interface. ASCOM Alpaca  Recent initiative called ASCOM Alpaca is currently under development. The Alpaca API uses RESTful techniques and TCP/IP to enable ASCOM applications and devices to communicate across modern network environments. This will enable ASCOM compatible devices to work across all the different operating systems including Linux and Mac OSX in near future.

The territory of the Diocese of Macau encompasses Macau, a special administrative region of China. In theory, a part of Guangdong province also belongs to the diocese, but in practice, the diocese is limited to Macau. Its cathedral is the Cathedral of the Nativity of Our Lady. Its patron saints are Francis Xavier and Catherine of Siena, and its motto is Scientia et Virtus (Knowledge and Virtue). Stephen Lee Bun-sang is the current bishop and the third Chinese bishop of the diocese.  History  It was established on January 23, 1576 by the edict of Pope Gregory XIII, on vast territory split off from Roman Catholic Diocese of Malacca. It originally covered China, Japan, Vietnam and the Malay archipelago, with the exception of the Philippines. From its founding, the diocese was a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese (soon Patriarchate) of Goa, in Portuguese India. It gradually lost most of its territory, in and around continental China: * on February 19, 1588 to establish the Diocese of Funai (Japan) * on September 9, 1659 to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Tonkin, the Apostolic Vicariate of Cochinchina (both in Vietnam), and Apostolic Vicariate of Nanjing * on April 22, 1841 to establish the then-Apostolic Prefecture of Hong Kong * on May 10, 1848 to establish the then-Apostolic Vicariate of Guangdong-Guangxi * on April 9, 1940 to establish the Diocese of D√≠li (on Timor) It was made exempt in 1975, following Portugal's loss of sovereignty over Goa, its former Metropolitan. It now only administers Macau alone, the last regions outside Macau under its administration were the parishes of Saint Joseph in Singapore (re-united with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore c. 1972) and St. Peter's Church in Malacca (now as part of Roman Catholic Diocese of Malacca-Johor), which separated from the Diocese of Macau in 1981.

Pastizzi usually have a filling (tal-ƒßaxu) either of ricotta (pastizzi tal- irkotta, cheese cake) or mushy peas (pastizzi tal-pi≈ºelli, pea cake). Pastizzi are a popular and well-known traditional Maltese food. It should not be confused with the Italian pastizz, better known as U' pastizz 'rtunnar. Preparation Pastizzi are usually diamond-shaped or round-shaped (known as pastizzi tax-xema' in Maltese) and made with a pastry very much like the Greek phyllo pastry (although there is also a puff pastry version). The pastry is folded in different ways according to the filling. They are typically baked on metal trays in electric or gas ovens in a pastizzerija, usually a small or family concern. They are also sold in bars, cafes and by street vendors. Culinary export Pastizzi are also produced by Maltese immigrant communities in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US. The first pastizzeria in Scotland opened in 2007.Maltese meat pies British Baker, 12 October 2007 Pastizzi in the Maltese language Such is its popularity, the word \\"pastizzi\\" has multiple meanings in Maltese.Fabri, Ray (2009) Maltese linguistics: a snapshot; in memory of Joseph A. Cremona (1922-2003) Bochum: Brockmeyer p.44 It is used as a euphemism for the female sexual organ, due to its shape, and for describing someone as a \\"pushover\\". The Maltese idiom jinbiegƒßu bƒßall-pastizzi (selling like pastizzi) is equivalent to the English \\"selling like hot cakes\\", to describe a product which seems to have inexhaustible demand.

Traffic Scotland Through the Traffic Scotland service, Transport Scotland provides a public service that aims to deliver safe and reliable trunk roads. The focus of Traffic Scotland is to minimise the effects of congestion, breakdowns and unforeseen events on the trunk road network. The Traffic Scotland service delivers traveller information for the Scottish Trunk Road network through a process of 'monitor, control and inform'. *Monitor: The Traffic Scotland service monitors the network using CCTV, roadside hardware, communication with the police, weather forecasts and major event management services. *Control: All information collected through the monitoring process is processed within the Traffic Scotland Control Centre. The Traffic Scotland Control Centre operates 24 hours a day to ensure that traffic and travel information disseminated as part of the Traffic Scotland service is accurate. *Inform: Traffic and travel information processed by the Traffic Scotland Control Centre is then disseminated via the Traffic Scotland service, including the Traffic Scotland website, the Traffic Customer Care Line, the Traffic Scotland mobile website, the Traffic Scotland Information Kiosks, road side Variable Message Signs (VMS) and via the multiple Traffic Scotland data services available to public, corporate and media users. Traffic Scotland also provide Freight Information which is a real-time traffic information website aimed at logistics operators and HGV drivers operating in Scotland. This section of their site provides the same functionality with some additional freight related information and web-links. In November 2016 they introduced a real-time service to allow drivers to track which roads had been gritted in the form of the Trunk Road Gritter Tracker. Regional Transport Partnerships The role of Regional Transport Partnerships (RTPs) is to strengthen the planning and delivery of regional transport developments. The first task of each RTP was to prepare a regional transport strategy. This is supported by a delivery plan where RTPs set out when and how projects and proposals would be delivered. Some RTPs are also responsible for the delivery of transport services. In particular Strathclyde Partnership for Transport owns and operates the Glasgow subway and major bus stations across the west of Scotland. The seven RTPs are: * Shetland Transport Partnership (ZetTrans) * Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership (HITRANS) * North-East of Scotland Transport Partnership (NESTRANS) * Tayside and Central Scotland Transport Partnership (Tactran) * South-East of Scotland Transport Partnership (SESTRAN) * Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) * South-West of Scotland Transport Partnership (SWESTRANS) See also *Transport in Scotland References External links * *Traffic Scotland website *Freight Scotland website Category:2006 establishments in Scotland Category:Executive agencies of the Scottish Government Category:Organisations based in Glasgow Category:Road transport in Scotland Category:Scottish websites Category:Transport in Scotland Category:Interested parties in planning in Scotland Category:Road authorities Category:Transport organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Transport Scotland"},{"id":"4258768","text":"Floyd Burton Jones (November 22, 1910, Cisco, Texas ‚Äì April 15, 1999, Santa Barbara, California) was an American mathematician, active mainly in topology. Jones's father was a pharmacist and local politician in Shackelford County, Texas. As the valedictorian of his high school class, Jones earned a Regents' Scholarship to The University of Texas, intending to study law eventually. Jones soon discovered that he had a poor memory for dates and history, and thus changed his major to chemistry. Jones had the extraordinary good fortune to be taught freshman calculus by Robert Lee Moore, a founder of topology in the US, a legendary mathematics teacher, and the inventor of the Moore method. Jones went on to take more mathematics courses than required to be a chemist. He displayed sufficient ability in those courses that when he graduated in 1932, Moore invited him to do a Ph.D. in mathematics and offered him a part- time job as a math instructor. Moore later supervised Jones's Ph.D. dissertation, completed in 1935. Jones then taught at the University of Texas for the next 15 years except during 1942‚Äì44, when he was a Research Associate at the Harvard Underwater Sound Laboratory, helping develop scanning sonar for the Navy. In 1950, Jones moved to the University of North Carolina, where he eventually headed the Department of Mathematics. From 1962 until his 1978 retirement, he was at the University of California at Riverside, where he helped launch the doctoral program in mathematics. Over the course of his career, Jones published 67 articles and supervised 15 Ph.D. dissertations. In 1987, he endowed a Chair in Topology at the University of California at Riverside. Jones taught using a modified version of the Moore method. He believed in \\"learning by doing\\" but unlike Moore, he incorporated textbooks into his courses. In 1969, Louis McAuley wrote that \\"the magical powers of Jones in the classroom-a master-who breathes the very life of mathematics into his students.\\" References External links * * * Rogers, James T.

Strain formerly worked for Marvel Comics as a colorist before pursuing a career as a writer. Strain's notable works include; the award-winning Marvel series Runaways, Marvel's Generation-X, and the Syfy TV show, the Magicians.  Personal life  Strain was born in Seoul, South Korea on April 27, 1981. She lived in South Korea for the majority of her youth, as her mother was from Gunsan, South Korea and her father was an Air Force officer stationed in South Korea. Except for a brief three years living in Illinois, from 1983 to 1986, Strain lived in South Korea for about fifteen years, during which she lived near a military base and attended Seoul American Elementary School and High School Upon graduating high school, Strain moved back to the United States in 1999 to attend Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge where she majored in graphic design. Strain currently lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband Jon Shiring, a lead engineer at Respawn Entertainment, and their adopted son. Career Strain got her start in comics working as a colorist for CrossGen in 2003. She was let go after two months working at CrossGen when the company began having financial problems and eventually went bankrupt in 2004. Weeks after losing her job at CrossGen, Strain began working for UDON and Aspen. Strain worked for UDON from 2003 to 2005, during which she contacted and impressed the Editor-in-Chief of UDON, Erik Ko, who helped her get a job at Marvel Comics. One of the first comics Strain worked on for Marvel was Runaways, which she worked on as an official colorist for about 6 years. Other prominent comics Strain worked on for Marvel include; Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, S.H.I.E.L.D., and World War Hulk. Additionally, Strain colored several Jay Company exclusive comic covers such as the Grimm Fairy Tales. Strain worked as a colorist for Marvel for 8 years, before she retired at 32 and decided to go to grad school at the American Film Institute. Initially, Strain was interested in 3-D graphics, but after taking a comic- writing class she realized she really wanted to write stories, so she switched her focus to screenwriting. While she was transitioning to a writing career, Strain collaborated with various artists to produce original works. Strain and Adrian Alphona, who previously worked together on the Marvel series Runaways, collaborated on an art book. Together they published Sweetness in 2011, consisting of random art illustrated by Aphona and colored and finished by Strain. In 2011, Strain met Jayd A√Øt-Kaci, an artist she long admired according to a Newsarama interview, through a mutual friend. Strain proposed that they collaborate on a webcomic and pitched various story ideas, of which A√Øt-Kaci liked The Fox Sister the best. Strain wrote the script for The Fox Sister and A√Øt-Kaci illustrated it, and they published the first few pages of The Fox Sister in July 2017 on their official website. Strain and A√Øt-Kaci always planned to officially publish The Fox Sister as a 9x12 hardbound comic book, and in 2012 they compiled and published the first chapter of their webcomic. The Fox Sister takes inspiration from the Korean folklore also called the Fox Sister, and is about a kumiho, a nine-tailed fox demon. On the webcomics official website, Stain describes The Fox Sister as a \\"Korean Supernatural thriller/dram-edy story\\" set in South Korea in the 1960s. As of October 2017 Strain has completed writing the fourth and final chapter of The Fox Sister. However, The Fox Sister is officially on hiatus according to the webcomic's website, and as of December 2018, only 17 pages of chapter four have been released. The Fox Sister continues to be available to freely read online. After her career switch from colorist to writer, Strain began working as a staff writer for the Syfy TV series, The Magicians, during its second season. As of December 2018, Strain continues to be employed as a staff writer for The Magicians. While writing for The Magicians, Strain returned to the comic book industry when Chris Robinson, the Editor of Marvel, asked her to write a short story for a Civil War anthology, Civil War II: Choosing Sides. After writing for the anthology, Strain was officially reintroduced to the comic world as a writer when she was asked to write for the rebooted X-Men series, Generation X. Strain was allowed to create her own concept and list of mutant characters for the rebooted Generation X, thus Strain came up with the concept of \\"lovable losers\\". Strain chose to feature a mix of original and already established but lesser known mutants, such as Nathaniel Carver created by Strain, and Nature Girl (Lin Li) created by Jason Latour. The relaunched Generation X series ran for a year, from 2017 to 2018 and published 11 issues, ending at No. 87 under the Marvel Legacy relaunch's numbering system .

The base, located near Devils Lake, North Dakota, was founded in 1904 as the Rock Island Military Reservation, but later renamed after Gilbert C. Grafton. History Camp Grafton of the North Dakota Army National Guard in Devils Lake, North Dakota is an ARNG Major Training Center. In 1904 some near Devils Lake was ceded to the State of North Dakota by the federal government for use as a permanent military reservation for the North Dakota National Guard. The camp was known as the Rock Island Military Reservation, (later renamed Camp Gilbert C. Grafton in 1921). Geography Devils Lake, the largest natural body of water in North Dakota, has been getting larger every year since 1993, much to the frustration of area residents. Rising water threatens to flood the city of Devils Lake, Camp Grafton, roads, fields, sewage treatment plants, and other human facilities. Devils Lake has a long history of fluctuating water levels. Water levels have risen over , flooding pasture, farmland, homes, businesses, and roads. The fluctuating water level of Devils Lake has been a concern to area residents for a number of years. In 1983, then Governor Olson issued a Disaster Emergency Proclamation for the area due to the damage to roads and property caused by flooding (Bluemle, 1983). A drought that began in 1988 caused the lake level to decline again. Camp Grafton (South) In 1983 the North Dakota National Guard received funding from the state legislature to purchase land in Eddy County. Today the \\"new\\" training area is known as Camp Grafton South. In 1997 the training facility located at Camp Grafton (South) was designated as the Major General C. Emerson Murry regional live fire and maneuver training center, though it remained a part of the overall Camp Grafton training complex. Major General C. Emerson Murry served in the North Dakota national guard from 1955 to 1984, and served as adjutant general from 1975 to 1984. Camp Grafton (South Unit) (CGS) consists of of a transitional grassland ecosystem. Transitional grasslands contain both tall grass prairies of the east and mixed grass prairies of the west. CGS is one of the largest contiguous areas of transitional grasslands North Dakota. Grazing has been the predominant use of the training area since 1920. Cattle grazing mimics the prehistoric grazing by herbivores (elk and bison). The rolling hills of transitional grasslands are a tremendous training area for open-area combat arms maneuvers necessary for our mechanized engineer and air defense artillery units. To maintain the transitional grassland ecosystem, grazing licenses are auctioned to local ranchers; providing income, which is, reinvested back into the training site. The transitional grassland ecosystem is seriously threatened by leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), an introduced weed. The primary control in the past has been concentrated use of 2,4-D and picloram herbicides. In the past five years, the North Dakota Army National Guard, in partnership with the Range Science Department of North Dakota State University has implemented an integrated pest management plan to control leafy spurge using cultural and chemical controls. The cultural controls consist of grazing spurge tolerant sheep on heavily infested sites, and treating small concentrations through chemical application. The NDARNG is expected to reduce herbicide costs by 79% over the next six years, with a realization of increased grass production of 50%. The USDA in other trials throughout the United States is implementing this integrated plan of combined cultural and chemical treatment.

The Library & Learning Center at Ca√±ada College Ca√±ada College is a public community college in Redwood City, located in San Mateo County, California. It is one of the smallest community colleges in the San Francisco Bay Area.  History  In 1957, the San Mateo Junior College District Board of Trustees developed a 25-year District master plan based on the recommendations of a citizens' advisory committee, and the same year submitted a $5.9 million bond issue to voters that was approved by a three-to-one margin. The bond issue victory cleared the way for prompt acquisition of the present College of San Mateo campus and also provided funds for purchase of a site west of Skyline Boulevard and south of Sharp Park Road in San Bruno. A third site of west of the Farm Hill subdivision on the Redwood City-Woodside line, was purchased in 1962. The current College of San Mateo campus was opened in 1963, followed by Ca√±ada College, Redwood City, in 1968, and Skyline College, San Bruno, in 1969. Construction of Ca√±ada and Skyline was made possible in large part from proceeds from a second bond issue of $12.8 million approved by District voters in March, 1964. Educational and architectural planning for Ca√±ada was accomplished in 1964-66 and proceeded on the theory that a first phase for at least 2,000 students should be designed to permit expansion ultimately to 8,000 day students. Grading of the site began in 1966, and the building construction contract was awarded in April, 1967. The first classes ‚Äì for 2,000 students ‚Äì were held in September, 1968. The Ca√±ada College Dedication Program was held on April 27, 1969. The first President, Bill Goss, welcomed dignitaries including Francis Pearson Jr. then president of the Board of Trustees. Carl Sitton, conductor of the college choir, opened the invocation with a song of praise. The total cost to build the campus was $12.2 million. The of buildings cost to build.  Campus  The college is located on in the western part of Redwood City. There is a campus Library and librarians provide free research and citation help to students, and the Library features a computer lab, private study rooms, photocopiers, and a book scanning machine. In 2006, artist Deborah Butterfield created a wood and bronze sculpture of a horse which sits in the quad. The sculpture is titled ‚ÄúThomas‚Äù in honor of Ca√±ada College President Thomas Mohr, who was responsible for shepherding the process of bringing the sculpture to Ca√±ada College and to the Redwood City Community. It is also an expression of deep appreciation for what he did to support and elevate the arts at Ca√±ada College.  Academics  The college offers more than 40 instructional programs under three instructional divisions: Business, Design & Workforce; Humanities & Social Sciences; and Science & Technology.  Regional Center for STEM  Ca√±ada is a regional center for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education. The college has built an award-winning STEM Center under the guidance of Cathy Lipe. It is located in the Learning Center on the second floor of Building 9. The STEM Center supports students with internship and scholarship opportunities and is the hub of academic activity on campus. Faculty in the Science & Technology Division often hold office hours in the STEM Center to better assist students.  Partnerships with NASA, SFSU  Because of the school's excellence in STEM education, it has developed partnerships with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and San Francisco State University. The COMETS Project (Creating Opportunities for Minorities in Engineering, Technology, and Science) is a collaboration between Ca√±ada College's Engineering Department and San Francisco State University School of Engineering. The project is sponsored by NASA's Office of Education through Curriculum Improvement Partnership Award for the Integration of Research into the Undergraduate Curriculum (CIPAIR).  Helping underrepresented students in STEM  The SOLES project is supported by a grant from the US Department of Education through the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP). SOLES aims to maximize the likelihood of success among underrepresented and educationally disadvantaged students interested in pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields through a combination of programs and services proven to increase recruitment, retention and success. The Mathematics, Science and Engineering Transfer Scholarships (M-SETS) program provides 140 scholarship awards to academically talented, financially needy students working to transfer to a four-year university to complete an undergraduate degree in an engineering, math or science major. M-SETS awards are offered for up to three years of full-time academic study at Ca√±ada College and in the first semester that a student transfers to a four-year university. The scholarship program provides a unique opportunity for low-income students to focus full-time on their studies and fully benefit from a support system provided through Ca√±ada's Math, Engineering & Science Achievement (MESA) Program. MESA aims to increase student success by providing tutoring, Academic Excellence Workshops and peer mentoring as well as STEM-related student clubs and professional speaker panels. Students are engaged in leadership development, scientific seminars, and field trips to industry and four-year universities. Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) is an academic preparation program that assists California's students to succeed in math and science and attain four-year degrees in math and science fields. MESA serves educationally disadvantaged students and, to the extent possible by law, emphasizes participation by under-represented students. The MESA California Community College Program (MESA CCCP) serves community college students and assists them in successfully transferring to four-year institutions as math or science majors. The MESA Community College Program provides math, engineering and science academic enrichment to community college students so they excel academically and transfer to four-year institutions as math-based majors. The program establishes academic-based community centers at campuses where most students are commuters and opportunities for peer support and information-sharing are scarce. The program is supported by industry, so students learn firsthand about career options and learn about scholarships, internships and special programs.  Working With Engineering Faculty Across the State  The Summer Engineering Teaching Institute (SETI) assists California community college engineering faculty in developing a Tablet-PC-enhanced interactive model of engineering instruction, and increases their involvement in developing and implementing online courses using CCC Confer‚Äîa videoconferencing platform that is available free of charge to all faculty and staff of the California Community College system. Approximately 30 California engineering faculty are selected to participate, 10 from Southern California, and 20 from Northern California. Supporting veterans Ca√±ada is also helping veterans transition into the community. The Bay Bridge to Engineering for Veterans Program is supported by a grant through the Workforce Investment Act: Veterans' Employment-Related Assistance Program (VEAP), and developed through a partnership between Ca√±ada College, San Francisco State University, the San Mateo County Workforce Investment Board, and Growth Sector. The Veterans Employment Assistance Grant (VEAP) provides a unique opportunity for veterans and their qualifying spouses to enter a career in Engineering. Selected candidates enter a nine-month Pre-Engineering program at Ca√±ada receiving a CAD or Surveying Certificate, the opportunity to compete for paid internships, and assistance in transferring to one of the four-year Engineering Programs at SFSU and CSU. Additionally, candidates have access to career counseling, mental health services, job development, and supplies necessary to begin a new career in engineering. The college has also established the Veterans Resource and Opportunity Center (VROC). Services to veterans include admissions help, academic counseling, placement testing, financial aid, priority enrollment and more.

He is best known as the co-author of the book They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky (2005), written with his brother Alephonsion Deng, cousin Benjamin Ajak, and Judy A. Bernstein. When Benson was a seven-years-old member of the Dinka tribe, Sudanese National Islamic militants attacked his village of Juol, Sudan, and he fled with his brother and cousin at the age of five. Wearing only his underwear he, along with thousands of other boys, traveled a thousand miles across Sudan to Ethiopia on foot, without parents, facing crocodiles, yellow fever, chronic hunger and thirst, and militants along the way. Refugee camps which he arrived at like Panyido were already crowded, and contained 50,000 people or more. In Ethiopia, he learned the English alphabet by writing with his finger in the sand, using limited materials from the UN. He was forced out of Ethiopia when militants attacked the camp that he was staying at very near the border, at the River Gilo. Benson next arrived in Natinga, a rebel army camp. Promised that he would be arriving in a safe camp with education, he was disappointed to see that he was instead led to do manual labor, and fight for the rebel cause. He escaped after his relatives left the camp, in a group of 12 boys. Seeing that people had died while resting in shade after a long trek, he left his resting group and marched alone to safety. He reached Kenya, met his family, and began his education again, but he was soon struck with a serious skin illness. This disease, called River Blindness, made it impossible for him to sit and attend class. So for five years he taught himself English. Lying on his stomach in his hut, he would copy essentials of grammar and vocabulary into his hand-written composition book. Deng arrived to America on August 9, 2001 and began work at a grocery store. Today he runs the computer digital photography system at Waste Management Corporation in El Cajon, California. Once in America, his brother and cousin began writing about their experiences. Joni Evans, VP of William Morris, sold their book to Public Affairs.

The station is owned and operated by Public Radio for the Front Range. The station's programming is, for the most part, with the exception of several syndicated shows, composed of volunteer DJs of various genres, and has a creative format. Although similar in funding strategies to a traditional public radio station, KRFC 88.9 FM Radio Fort Collins is not a member of any of the major networks such as NPR or Pacifica. History Public Radio for the Front Range (PRFR) was started by a group of former DJs from KCSU-FM. DJs who were not students were forced to leave after KCSU-FM's underwriter, Colorado State University, decided to make KCSU-FM solely student-run. In September 1995, PRFR was given IRS 501(C)(3) non-profit status. By the summer of 1996, PRFR had applied for a construction permit for 88.9 MHz, only to be challenged by several Christian broadcasting groups. In 1997, PRFR went into negotiations with Colorado Christian University to share 88.9 MHz. These negotiations failed, and in the spring of 1998, PRFR applied for 89.7 MHz. In 2000, the group applied for a frequency in the low-power jurisdiction; another Christian group applied for the same frequency, leading to delay. Finally, after successful negotiations, PRFR came into agreement with the other applicants that they would receive 88.9 MHz. The agreement was submitted to the FCC on July 7, 2002, the FCC granted PRFR a construction permit for a 3,000-watt non-commercial radio station. KRFC 88.9 FM Radio Fort Collins began broadcasting on March 1, 2003. Today, KRFC 88.9 FM Radio Fort Collins has grown, and in 2004, completed the construction and expansion of its studios.

Early life John Carter Brown was born in 1797, the youngest of three surviving children born to Nicholas Brown, Jr. (1769‚Äì1841), the namesake patron of Brown University, and Ann Carter, daughter of John Carter, a prominent printer in Providence. His grandfather was Nicholas Brown, Sr. (1729‚Äì1791), brother of John Brown, Moses Brown, and Joseph Brown, merchants, active in Rhode Island politics, who brought the College of Rhode Island to Providence in 1771. During his upbringing, he was taught philanthropy and public leadership by his father and his uncles who were involved with such work. He attended Brown University (renamed in honor of a gift made by his father in 1804) and graduated in 1816. His graduation oration was on ‚ÄúThe Revolution of Empires.‚Äù Career In 1822, John Carter Brown was sent to Europe as a super-cargo for Brown & Ives. After being shipwrecked in France, he turned the business trip into a two-year grand tour.Dr. Benjamin Carter, his eriudite uncle, was an important influence in introducing John Carter Brown to ‚Äúthe great subject,‚Äù the interaction between the old and new worlds. After his father's death in 1841, John Carter Brown had the freedom to withdraw from Brown & Ives affairs and to develop his passion for books. In fact, he was continuing a family tradition as his ancestors had been buying books since 1749, helping to found the Providence Library in 1758 and 83 years later, the Providence Athenaeum. In 1846, he bought his elder brother's collection of books on the Americas and began purchasing books in Europe, using Henry Stevens as his agent. The same year, he bought the collection of Frenchman Henri Ternaux. When his collection became too large, he expanded his house, the Nightingale-Brown House, by adding a modern fireproof library; he also hired a full-time librarian, John Russell Bartlett, to manage the collection and produce its first catalogue. In 1846, he became the first American to join the Hakluyt Society as a charter member, and in 1855, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1852, he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Brown University.

Ives, Thomas P. I. Goddard, and George W. R. Matteson. In 1876, his wife had a cottage in Newport on Bellevue Avenue. Philanthropy In addition to gladly sharing his books, he still continued to make contributions to Brown University, Butler Hospital, and the Rhode Island Hospital. He played major roles in Anti-Slavery campaigns, he became President of the Emigrant Aid Society. Before his death, he was able to amass a collection of 7,500 books.

Besides several varieties of pizza, Santarpio's menu offers only three other items: barbecued lamb, steak tips and sausage. For a long time, part of the restaurant's charm was the unadorned atmosphere plastered with walls of boxing memorabilia and posters, and waiters who were not particularly helpful. That has moderated to a degree in recent years, and even the baby-food jars that once held crushed red pepper have been replaced by conventional containers.Phantom Gourmet Review The restaurant's staff are also memorable for their character, mannerisms, and longevity.

It was recorded at Rockfield Studios and released in 1972. It reached No. 14 on the UK album charts. New members The rhythm section of Dave Anderson and Terry Ollis was replaced by Lemmy and Simon King, both of whose style differed notably from their predecessors. This changed the band‚Äôs overall musical direction. Lemmy was a self-confessed inept guitarist who used volume and stagecraft to cover his lack of ability. He became a bassist by accident after joining the band, thinking he was replacing Huw Lloyd-Langton. Lemmy said However, Dave Brock decided to play lead and continue without a second guitarist. Hawkwind‚Äôs bass guitarist failed to turn up and Lemmy was available. He said: This led to Lemmy‚Äôs very unorthodox technique. Lemmy stated:King‚Äôs drumming was more square-beat and \\"rock\\" than the jazzier free- flowing Ollis. Sound and production Rockfield Studios was in its infancy and the environment at the time was spartan, Lemmy explaining that they \\"recorded it at the barn, before they modernised it, with mattresses on the walls and things.\\" Some band members have expressed concerns with the quality of the production, Simon King feeling that \\"It sounded as if all the bass was turned off, your amp wasn‚Äôt working properly and your stereo was bunged up all at the same time.\\" and Lemmy adding \\"It was just not very well recorded. It was all thin and tinny.\\" Dave Brock explained their method of working as \\"we recorded bass, guitar, drums and vocals together, so it's as live as it can be, and then we put on the other things afterwards... We just let the tapes run and play like we do when we're playing live; do a three-hour track and then cut it up into pieces, use one piece as a complete section, and join it up to another piece with a synthesiser link or something... It's improvised, but it's together in the first place.\\"Sounds, 23 September 1972 ‚Äì In Search of Hawkwind Songs \\"Brainstorm\\" is Turner's first solo composition for the band, and features an extended middle section that would be reworked throughout the years (including Ginger Baker's drum solo in 1980). Before its appearance on this album, it was recorded on 2 August 1972 at the BBC's Maida Vale studio for broadcast on the Johnnie Walker show along with \\"Silver Machine\\", followed by an appearance on the In Concert hour-long BBC broadcast from the Paris Cinema on 28 September 1972. It has almost remained an ever- present in the live set with numerous live versions being released, and was covered by Monster Magnet on their 1993 album Superjudge. \\"Space Is Deep\\" lyrics are derived from Michael Moorcock's \\"Black Corridor\\" poem. The first vocal part is an acoustic piece played by both Brock (on 12-string) and Lemmy with layered electronic effects, the second instrumental part being the full band in an electric workout, finally returning to an acoustic coda. It was dropped from the live set during 1973 as the band moved away from the Space Ritual show, only briefly being resurrected for some reunion shows during 2000, a version of which can be heard on the Yule Ritual album. \\"One Change\\" is a brief sedate instrumental featuring a heavily echoed keyboard contribution from Del Dettmar. An edited version of \\"Lord of Light\\" (see Zelazny's Lord of Light) was released as a single in Germany (UA35492, June 1973) backed by an edited version of \\"Born to Go\\" from the Greasy Truckers Party album. It was dropped from the live set in the mid-1970s, but reinstated for the 1995 \\"Alien 4\\" tour, a version being released as the B-side to the 1997 single \\"Love in Space\\". \\"Down Through the Night\\" is another Brock acoustic number with layered electronics, flute and reverse echoed vocals. For the Space Ritual set it featured the full electric band. \\"Time We Left (This World Today)\\" is a song in four movements, the first being a chanted Call and response bemoaning the direction society was heading in the same vein Brock was exploring with \\"We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago\\" and \\"Psychedelic Warlords\\". The second movement is an instrumental dissonance passage leading into the third movement featuring a powerful bass guitar and lead guitar interchange, eventually returning to the first movement. It appeared in the Space Ritual set with \\"Paranoia\\" replacing the middle section, and also made an appearance during 1989‚Äì91 with \\"Heads\\" as the middle section, as can be heard on Palace Springs. \\"The Watcher\\" is Lemmy's first composition for Hawkwind, this being a spacious acoustic number with fuzz-bass. The lyrics were written from the perspective of someone from afar (perhaps God or an alien master race) watching the inhabitants of Earth destroy themselves through their own greed. This is the only song from the album that wasn't featured in the Space Ritual set, but it did briefly make an appearance during 1973 and 1974 as can be heard on The 1999 Party, slightly rearranged as a more uptempo band performance. Lemmy would re-record the song with Mot√∂rhead on their 1977 debut album Motorhead. New acoustic versions of \\"Down Through The Night\\" and \\"The Watcher\\" were included on The Road to Utopia (2018), produced and arranged by Mike Batt with additional orchestrations, and a guest appearance by Eric Clapton on \\"The Watcher\\". Title, sleeve and philosophy The package was put together and titled by graphic artist Barney Bubbles and is a continuation on themes he introduced with In Search of Space carried through and culminating in the Space Ritual. The title refers to the assignment of syllables to steps of the diatonic scale (Do-Re-Mi, etc.). It alludes to the music of the spheres which Bubbles expounds upon: > The basic principle for the starship and the space ritual is based on the > Pythagorean concept of sound. Briefly, this conceived the Universe to be an > immense monochord, with its single string stretched between absolute spirit > and at its lowest end ‚Äì absolute matter. Along this string were positioned > the planets of our solar system. Each of these spheres as it rushed through > space was believed to sound a certain tone caused by its continuous > displacement of the ether. These intervals and harmonies are called 'The > Sound Of The Spheres.' The interval between Earth and the fixed stars being > the most perfect harmonic interval.Melody Maker, 28 October 1972 ‚Äì Watch > This Space *Do ‚Äì Mars ‚Äì red *Re ‚Äì Sun ‚Äì orange *Mi ‚Äì Mercury ‚Äì yellow *Fa ‚Äì Saturn ‚Äì green *Sol ‚Äì Jupiter ‚Äì blue *La ‚Äì Venus ‚Äì Indigo *Ti ‚Äì Moon ‚Äì violet The original cover came in a silver foil sleeve with black print, the front depicting a shield which became an ident for the band, being used on many other album and single covers. The rear cover, inner sleeve and poster depict barbarian-type warriors in futuristic settings. The back cover includes in the legend: :The Saga of Doremi Fasol Latido is a collection of ritualistic space chants, battle hymns and stellar songs of praise as used by the family clan of Hawkwind on their epic journey to the fabled land of Thorasin. The legend tells of the Hawklords last and defeated stand against the \\"tyranny of the corrupt forces for law and evil\\", but the inner sleeve has redemption in the legend: > And in the fullness of time, the prophecy must be fulfilled and the > Hawklords shall return to smite the land. And the dark forces shall be > scourged, the cities razed and made into parks. Peace shall come to > everyone. For is it not written that the sword is key to Heaven and Hell? Critical reaction The UK music press warmly received the album, Nick Kent in NME confessing \\"I'd be ashamed to say I didn't love it\\" describing the music as one chord short of \\"the strongest high energy cosmic hubcap this side of the Metal Zone\\".NME; 9 December 1972 ‚Äì Hawkwind: A Good One Andrew Means of Melody Maker commented that \\"It's not melody and it's not harmony, and it's not really rhythm... it is ambiguity. It is the spaced out slipstream, the rushing, gurgling torrent of weightless sound that first turns the circle of mental pictures, associations and impressions picked out from space, time and earth... The listener is as much a traveller as the musician.\\"Melody Maker, 16 December 1972 ‚Äì Hawkwind: A group in search of melody Sounds' Martin Hayman meanwhile described the music as \\"the bass and drums batter on with unflagging pace, synthesisers swirl and whistle around the thunderous block riffs whose endless repetition generates that numbed hypnosis, tuneless and menacing voices incant largely incomprehensible lyrics. This is not to knock Hawkwind: the sound they are getting is thicker, fuller, more convincing than ever before.

The school comprises about 700 medical students, 550 faculty members and 550 residents in 48 graduate medical education programs including residencies, subspecialty residencies and fellowships. The School is a pioneer in geriatric medicine, chronic disease prevention, cardiovascular disease, organ transplantation, neurosciences and vaccine research among others. It is a leading center of research in five key areas: cancer, infectious disease, liver disease, aging and brain disorders, and heart/lung disease. It provides health services on a local, national, and international level while conducting medical research and training physicians and biomedical scientists of the future. Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital and Saint Louis University Hospital are the two main affiliated teaching hospitals of the school. Saint Louis School of Medicine. History Saint Louis University School of Medicine was established in 1836 as the Medical Department of the University and had the distinction of awarding the first M.D. degree west of the Mississippi River in 1839. Several affiliated doctors of national importance include William Beaumont, whose pioneering studies of the human digestive system opened a new world of research, and Daniel Brainerd, who later founded Rush Medical College (then part of the University of Chicago). Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital and Saint Louis University Hospital are the two main affiliated teaching hospitals of the school. SLU Ambulatory Care Unit The Know-Nothing movement, an anti-immigrant and subsequently anti Catholic movement that surged through the United States in the 1840s and 1850s eventually led to the separation of the University's Medical Department from the University in 1854. As a result, the University was without a medical school for 59 years until the presidency of Father William Banks Rogers (1900 to 1908), during which plans were initiated for the integration of a new medical school into the University. In 1903, the Marion Sims-Beaumont College of Medicine was incorporated into the University. At this time, Marion Sims- Beaumont College was a medical school owned and operated by a group of St. Louis physicians. The college's decision to merge with the University was greatly influenced and reinforced by the recommendations of the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association, which insisted that all schools of medicine be affiliated with a University. Assured of financial support from the St. Louis civic leader Festus J. Wade, President Rogers successfully secured the needed funds for the purchase of the Marion Sims-Beaumont College. Since 1994, the students and physicians of the School of Medicine have been committed to providing free primary healthcare services in an academic environment through their Health Resource Center.

The new Doisy Research Center. In 2007, a new research center was added to the university. Made of glass and steel in just 522 working days, the 10-story tower now stands at the northern gateway to the University's Medical Center. This 206,000 square-foot building is named after the late Dr. Edward Adelbert Doisy, who was not only a Nobel Laureate but also a professor at Saint Louis University for five decades. \\"The University's $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center is now the new home of Saint Louis University researchers working in five key areas of scientific discovery: cancer and molecular biology; liver disease; cardiovascular disease; neurosciences and aging; and vaccine development\\". Effective April 1, 2008, Philip O. Alderson, former chairman of the radiology department at Columbia University, became the 12th dean of the Medical School. The medical school continues to be a leader in research in many fields, especially in emerging diseases, neuroscience, organ transplantation, vaccine development, cardiac health, and afflictions of the liver. Currently, numerous cutting edge research projects are underway including those examining aging and brain disorders, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, biodefense, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and tuberculosis vaccines. Actually, the Saint Louis School of Medicine is one of only eight NIH-funded vaccine research institutions, and made significant contributions to the research and development of the H1N1 influenza vaccine.

Khudydad was born in 1860, in Zard Sang village of Nawur Distric of Ghazni Province of Afghanistan, he spent a part of his life in Nawur District another district of Ghazni, and died in Kabul on March 3, 1931.Kabul Under Siege: Fayz Muhammad's Account of the 1929 Uprising By Fayz Mu·∏•ammad, translated by R. D. McChesney p 16 He was an ethnic Hazara and was of Muhammad Khwaja Hazara clan. He was Afghan court chronicler, a skilled calligrapher and secretary to Emir Habib Ullah Khan from 1901 to 1919.Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \\"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\\" Moscow, 1988. p. 20 He was a well known historian, writer and intellectual, among the renowned group of Afghans seeking social and political changes in the country at the beginning of the 20th century, which shaped early regional politics from Afghanistan to Morocco therefore many of the Afghan people say the government should have named him as the Father of Afghanistan History. He was a member of what became known as Junbish-i Mashrutyat or The Constitutionalist Movement.  Early life  Faiz Mohammad spent his youth in Qarabagh District, tutored in Arabic and the Koran by local mullahs, in 1880 he and his family moved first to Nawur and then, because of sectarian strife, to Qandahar in the same year. In 1887 he left Qandahar for a year's travel that took him to Lahore and Peshawar where he spent some time studying English and Urdu. He eventually landed in Jalalabad and was invited in 1888 to join the administration of the Afghan amir Abdur Rahman Khan.Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \\"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\\" Moscow, 1988. p. 13  History  He was soon attached to the entourage of the amir's eldest son, Habib Ullah Khan, at the recommendation of one of his teachers, Mullah Sarwar Ishaq'zai. Faiz Mohammad accompanied the prince from Kabul to Jalalabad in 1311/1893-94.Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, \\"Siraj al-Tawarikh\\", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 990 There is a manuscript attributed to him, dated 29 Rajab 1311/5 February 1894, which places him in Jalalabad at this time. In 1314/1896, when Habib Ullah's younger brother Nasr Ullah Khan toured England on a state visit, Habib Ullah assigned Faiz Mohammad to copy and post in the Charsuq, Kabul's main market-place, the detailed letters sent back by Nasr Ullah recounting his activities, so that ‚Äúnoble and commoner alike would be apprised of the honor and respect that the English were according him‚Äù.Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara, \\"Siraj al-Tawarikh\\", Kabul, 1331-1333/1913-1915. III, p. 1107 During Habib Ullah's reign, Faiz Mohammad was involved, if only peripherally, with the Young Afghan movement led by Mahmud Baig Tarzi. He is said to have been associated with the publication of Tarzi's reformist journal, Siraj al-Akbar, and three other journals, Anis, ·∏§ayy alal-falah, and Aina-ye Irfan. After the assassination of his patron in 1337/1919, Faiz Mohammad worked for a time at the Ministry of Education on textbook revision. Sometime later, he was appointed to a teaching position at the Habibiya Laycee (Habibiya High School) in Kabul. During the reign of Aman Ullah Khan (1919‚Äì29), the Iranian minister in Kabul Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh compiled a ‚Äúwho‚Äôs who‚Äù of contemporary Afghan leaders. His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout Shia Muslim, highly regarded by the Qizilbash community of Kabul, as well as a leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission about what was going on in the capital.M. Farrokh, \\"Tarikh-e Siasi-ye Afghanistan\\", Tehran, 1314 ≈†./1935; Reprinted, Qom, 1371 ≈†./1992, pp. 252-54 In 1929, the Tajik outlaw Habib Ullah Kalakani, also in a derogatory manner called Bacha ye Saqqao (son of the water-carrier), ousted Aman Ullah Khan and took control of Kabul for nine months (January to October 1929). During this uprising Faiz Mohammad, who spent almost the entire period inside the city, kept a journal which was the basis for an unfinished monograph entitled Kitab-e Tadakoor-e Enqilab which he began shortly after the fall of Bacha ye Saqqao. During the occupation, Faiz Mohammad was forced to take part in a delegation sent by Kalakani to negotiate with Hazara groups opposing the Tajik leader. According to his account, he managed to subvert Kalakani's plans and caused the mission to fail. However, he and the mission's leader, Noor al-Din Agha, a Qizilbash Shi øite from Kabul, paid a heavy price for this: both were sentenced to death by beating. Faiz Mohammad alone survived the ordeal and was saved by a colleague. The Persian mission in Kabul, under a directive from Reza Shah to do what it could to aid the Shi øites of Kabul, sent medicines to his house. He eventually recovered enough to travel the following year to Tehran for more medical care. After less than a year there, he returned to Kabul, where he died on 6 Shawal 1349/3 March 1931, at the age of sixty-eight or sixty- nine.Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \\"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\\" Moscow, 1988. p. 24.  Publications  Faiz Mohammad is best known for his books on Afghan history. During Habib Ullah's reign, he accepted two commissions to write a comprehensive history of Afghanistan covering events from the time of Ahmad Shah down through the reign of Habib Ullah Khan. The first was a history of Afghanistan entitled Tohfat ul-Habib (·∏§abib's gift) in honor of the amir, but Habib Ullah Khan deemed the finished work unacceptable and ordered Faiz Mohammad to start over. The revised version is the three- volume history of Afghanistan entitled Siraj al-Tawarikh (Lamp of Histories), an allusion to the amir's honorific ‚ÄúLamp of the Nation and Religion‚Äù (Siraj al-mella wa æl-din). There were also problems in publishing it, the third volume never being completely printed. It is thought that the process of publishing the third volume lasted several years and only ended after Habib Ullah Khan's death.V. A. Romodin, ‚ÄúSources of the Siraj al-Tawarikh,‚Äù in Pis‚Äômennye pamyatniki i problemy istorii kul‚Äôtury narodov Vostoka, May 1969, p. 114 (Abstracts of papers presented at the Fifth Annual Session of the Literary Division of the Institute of Orientalistics, Academy of Sciences) Some say the publication on the third volume was halted at page 1,240 for unspecified reasons.M. Ghobar, \\"Tari·∏µ-e Adabiyat-e Afghanistan\\", Kabul, n.d.  øA. ·∏§abibi, \\"Jonbesh-e mashrutiyat dar Afghanistan\\", Kabul, 1363 ≈†./1984. p. 396 Habib Ullah Khan's successor, Aman Ullah Khan, was initially interested in the work and typesetting resumed in the mid-1920s, but when the amir reviewed the material in it on Anglo-Afghan relations, he reportedly changed his mind, and ordered all published but still incomplete copies of the third volume taken from the press and burned.Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \\"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\\" Moscow, 1988 p. 17 Despite this reaction, Faiz Mohammad continued work on his chronicle. The manuscript of the remainder of the third volume is widely believed to have been finished, and the autograph was reportedly turned over to the Afghan archives by Faiz Mohammad's son. Volumes devoted to Habib Ullah Khan and Aman Ullah Khan may also have been written. A farman issued by the latter announced that Faiz Mohammad had been ordered to complete the Siraj and then begin work on a chronicle of the reign of Aman Ullah Khan to be entitled Tarikh-e Asr-e Amaniya. There is some evidence to suggest he did indeed carry out these commissions, although nothing more was ever published.Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as \\"Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe\\" Moscow, 1988. p. 18 Besides the monumental Siraj al-Tawrikh, Faiz Mohammad wrote the following works: * Tuhfatul Habib' Afghan History (1747‚Äì1880), in two volumes. (The original script, hand-written by Faiz Mohammed, exists in the National Archive in Kabul) * Tazkeratul Enqilaab accounts of the days of Habibullah, Bacha-e Saqaw * History of Ancient Prophets/Rulers, from Adam to Jesus * HidƒÅyat-i kisht-i gul-hƒÅ va qalamah-hƒÅ va ·∏•ub≈´bƒÅt va ghayrah (1921‚Äì1922) * JughrƒÅfiyƒÅ-yi ·π≠ab ªƒ´ va Afrƒ´qƒÅ * Tarikh-e Hokama-ye Motaqaddem, compiled while he was working at the Ministry of Education; * Fayz al-Foyuzat, a fragment of which, called Afghan treaties and agreements ( øahd wa misaq-e afghan) was published in Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh's Tarikh-e Siasi-ye Afghanistan (Tehran, 1314 ≈†./1935) and which, in tune with the times, was a sharp critique of the Abdul Rahman's relations with the British; * Faqarat-e Shar øiya, which is not known to have survived; and * Nasab-nama-ye Tawa æef-e afghena wa ta øaddod-e nofus-e ishan, also known as Nijhad-nama-ye Afghan, a description of Afghan tribes and non-Afghans residing in Afghanistan. The Nijhad-nama was published in Persia in 1933 from a manuscript thought to be the autograph and held in the Kitab Khana-ye Milli-ye Malik in Tehran.\\"Nijhad-nama-ye Afghan, editors. K. Yazdani and A. Ra·∏•imi, Qom, 1372 ≈†./1993. pp. 29‚Äì32 Among the works he is known to have copied is a 230 folio collection of farmans issued by the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb (1068‚Äì1118/1658‚Äì1707) which he completed in Jalalabad in 1312/1894; the divan of ≈†ehab-e Torshizi, a late 18th-century poet from Herat; and Risala-ye fiuz, a treatise on explosives. In the late 20th century American scholar Robert D. McChesney extensively researched Faiz Mohammed's life and written works, in particular the Sirajul Tawarikh. In 1999 McChesney published a translation of Tazkeratul Enqilaab's under the title Kabul under siege: Fayz Muhammad's account of the 1929 Uprising. In 2012 McChesney and Mehdi Khorrami completed the first English translation of the Sirajul Tawarikh.McChesney, Robert, and Khorrami, Mohammad Mehdi, eds.

In 1771, Nicholas Brown Sr. was instrumental in convincing Baptist authorities to locate a permanent home for the College in his hometown of Providence. In 1804, the College was renamed Brown University following a gift made by Brown's son Nicholas Brown Jr. Biography Born in 1729, the second child of James Brown II (1698‚Äì1739) and Hope Power Brown (1702‚Äì1792), Nicholas Brown Sr. was apprenticed to his uncle Obadiah Brown (1712‚Äì1762) from the age of 16. Just before his 21st birthday, his older brother Captain James Brown (1724‚Äì1750) died at sea. Nicholas took his role as head of the family very seriously, delaying his marriage to Rhoda Jenckes (1741‚Äì1783) until he was 33 years old. Following the death of his uncle Obadiah, the family business conglomerate that included maritime trade along the Eastern Seaboard, with the Caribbean and with England; a rum distillery; spermaceti candle manufacturing; an iron foundry (the Hope Furnace); and a network of shops, was renamed Nicholas Brown & Co. Until 1771, Brown worked in partnership with his three younger brothers Joseph (1733‚Äì1785), John (1736‚Äì1803), and Moses (1738‚Äì1836), who were known in Rhode Island annals as the \\"Four Brothers.\\" Thereafter, the brothers continued to collaborate on ventures but were no longer partners. Brown served in the Rhode Island Legislature and became a civic leader, funding or fundraising for the paving of Providence streets, a library, a market house, the College of Rhode Island's first building, the First Baptist Church, a fire engine and other civic improvements. During the Revolution, he speculated in war bonds, supplied the Continental Army with gunpowder and foodstuffs, transformed the Hope Furnace into cannon works, and funded several privateering ventures. During the post-war \\"critical period,\\" Brown was a leader of the Federalist faction in Rhode Island that opposed paper money and supported ratifying the U.S. Constitution.https://www.Grapplingwithlegacy.com Shortly after taking over the family business, Brown ordered a nine-and-a half foot mahogany desk- and-bookcase crafted by Daniel Spencer, who was the nephew of John Goddard. It was sold for his descendant, Nicholas Brown VI by Christie's Auctioneers on June 3rd, 1989 for $12,100,000, the highest price ever paid for a piece of decorative art at that date, to fund the restoration of the Nightingale-Brown House, which today is the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage at Brown University. The desk-and-bookcase currently resides in a Private Collection. Following Rhoda Brown's death in 1783, Brown remarried Avis Binney (1749‚Äì1807). He fathered ten children with Rhoda and one with Avis, of which only two survived: a son Nicholas Brown Jr. (1769‚Äì1841) and a daughter, Hope (1773‚Äì1855) who married Thomas Poynton Ives (1769‚Äì1835). When Brown died in 1791, the Rev. Dr. Stillman of Boston gave a eulogy: > He was the affectionate husband, the tender father, the compassionate > master, the dutiful son, the loving brother, and the steady, faithful > friend. He took much pains, by reading and by conversation, to inform his > mind, and had acquired much general knowledge. But religion was his favorite > subject.

The disastrous 1764 voyage of the \\"Sally\\" is described in detail in the final report of Brown University's Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice. Thereafter, Brown never again attempted slave trading and ensured his son was mentored by George Benson, an ardent abolitionist.

The film was written and directed by Tennyson Bardwell and is loosely based on Bardwell's college roommate.New York Times review Plot synopsis High school senior Dorian Lagatos realizes he is gay and meets another gay youth locally, but remains confused, and finally comes out to his brother, Nicky. Nicky is a scholarship-winning quarterback and favorite son to their hetero-normative and argumentative father. Dorian starts therapy, then resorts to confession in the Church. When his therapist and the church politely avoid offering any real help, Dorian has his first intimate encounter with a local gay youth. Dorian goes back to Nick, who was at first reluctant to accept his brother's sexuality. Nick attempts to teach Dorian how to fight and arranges to have him spend a night with a prostitute in order to make him become straight; from these efforts Dorian gains only a concussion and lesson in dancing, respectively. After much soul-searching, Dorian comes out to his father (while wearing a fuchsia shirt) for which he is kicked out of the house after a very surreal argument over whether or not Dorian is gay. His father is very preoccupied with who else may know of Dorian's defective nature although Nick confesses that he knows and an anti- climatic scene resolves with Dorian packing his bags. Dorian moves to New York City, a city he adores. Dorian expresses all kinds of angst over his life style, defending his true nature to his father over the Christmas holidays. Returning to New York, Dorian experiences a series of encounters with the darker side of life. Dorian finds a boyfriend, but he gets dumped after two months with no given reason. Dorian develops a deep depression and finally, in despair gives in to it, coincidental to Nicky visiting Dorian in the city. Nicky reluctantly joins Dorian with friends at Dorian's favorite local gay bar. Just as Dorian pleads with a friend to flaunt his newly found popularity, Nicky reunites with obsequious football friends‚Äîstealing Dorian's thunder. Dorian then learns his ex-boyfriend dumped him for another. The after- discussion of the evening revolves around Nick defending his sexuality to Dorian in the face of Nick's football friends being gay and Dorian defending his own sexuality to his brother. Later that night, Dorian awakes to Nicky crying and learn that Nick was cut from the football team and was stripped of his scholarship. In the middle of the discussion, they both learn their father has died of a heart attack. At the funeral, Dorian's mother, finally freed of the overbearing influence of Dorian's father, tells Dorian she regrets not stopping his father from being angry with him.

It reached No. 33 on the UK album charts. The title makes references to old science fiction magazines (Astounding and Amazing Stories), the concept being that each piece of music (and its title) would be interpreted as an individual science fiction story. The record cover is a parody of the cover of these magazines, while the inner sleeve carried small ads, with each band member having their own product (e.g. Dr Brock's cure for piles, Paul Rudolph's Manly Strapon, and Simon King's Pleasure Primer). The cover was double sided, one side illustrated by Calvert's childhood friend Tony Hyde, the other by Barney Bubbles signed as Grove Lane, with initial print-runs having either as the front cover. Bubbles original design was to have been Steppenwolf looming over the city. This album marked the start of a new era for Hawkwind, having left the management of Douglas Smith for Tony Howard and changed record companies from United Artists Records to Charisma Records. Musically, the dirty heavy metal lead bass guitar playing of Lemmy was replaced by the cleaner, formally trained bass playing of Paul Rudolph. All members of the band were now contributing to the writing and arrangement of the music leading to more width in style, and the recording and production is better defined than previous albums.In a 1981 issue of Kerrang!, Dave Brock stated, \\"I used to mix all our albums when I was tripping, right up until the Astounding Sounds album. Some of those mixes turned out to be really strange, embarrassing some of them.\\" The greatest change is in the return of Robert Calvert, this time as a permanent vocalist rather than the peripheral poet role he occupied on Space Ritual. Not only did he bring crafted lyrics to the band, but he was intent on turning live shows into a piece of music theatre with specific characters for him to act out, Calvert explaining in a 1976 interview that \\"We're writing numbers now with visual ideas in mind, rather than trying to think of things to impose on numbers we've already got. We're trying to get the visual side of the band focussed on individuals rather than on screen projections. Nik, Dave and myself are, in some parts of the show, playing the parts of actors... All in all, it works up to quite a nice piece of theatre, spontaneous theatre that is.\\"Sounds, 2 October 1976, Geoff Barton  Songs  \\"Reefer Madness\\" lyrics are inspired by the 1936 anti- marijuana propaganda film Reefer Madness. It was performed during the tour of the album, appearing on the live album Atomhenge 76, and remained in the set until the formation of the Hawklords in 1978. The song was added to the setlist in 1990/1 to be performed by Bridget Wishart, a version appearing on the live album California Brainstorm. Calvert had written the lyrics to \\"Steppenwolf\\" when Adrian Wagner, for his album Distances Between Us, \\"wanted a song about living in cities and I was re-reading Hesse's Steppenwolf at the time. It seemed to me that there was a strong myth in it about city life and it gave me the basic idea.\\" It was performed during the tour of the album, appearing on the live album Atomhenge 76, and remained in the band's set until Calvert left in 1978, versions included on Weird Tape 4 and 5. The song has occasionally been re-instated into the live set, between 1982 and 1984 it was performed by Turner, in 1996 by Ron Tree, in 2003 by Arthur Brown and in 2017 by Mr Dibs during the Into The Woods tour. \\"City of Lagoons\\" is a Powell composed instrumental, although erroneously credited to House on the album's release. \\"The Aubergine That Ate Rangoon\\" is an instrumental, its title references Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band's 1967 hit single \\"The Eggplant That Ate Chicago\\". \\"Kerb Crawler\\" was released as a single backed by \\"Honky Dorky\\" which is the band jamming on \\"Reefer Madness\\". There are reportedly two versions of the A-side, the original and a re-mix by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour ‚Äì it is the latter that appeared on the album. \\"Kadu Flyer\\" lyrics were written by Turner, who credited them to Jamie Mandelkau for legal reasons (Turner was still under contract either to United Artists or Douglas Smith). Calvert is also given a writers credit on some releases. Kadu is an abbreviation of Kathmandu. \\"Chronoglide Skyway\\" is a House composed instrumental, although erroneously credited to Powell on the album's release. It was performed during the tour of the album, appearing on the live album Atomhenge 76.  Critical reception  The NME investigative journalist Dick Tracy (a pseudonym of John May) reviewed the album as \\"Hawkwind are back on form... their music has acquired about fifteen new levels since the old churn- churn days\\".

Early life Nicholas Brown Jr. was the son of Rhoda Jenckes (1741‚Äì1783) and Nicholas Brown Sr. (1729‚Äì1791), a merchant and co-founder of Brown University (which was then called College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations). He was the nephew of John Brown (1736‚Äì1803) and Moses Brown (1738‚Äì1836) and a descendant of the English colonist and Baptist minister Chad Brown (c. 1600‚Äì1650), who co-founded Providence. His maternal grandfather was Daniel Jenckes (1701‚Äì1774), a judge from a prominent family. Career Both Nicholas Brown Jr. and his father were members of and large donors to the First Baptist Church in America. Nicholas Brown Jr. graduated from the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1786. After the death of his father, Brown created the company of Brown & Ives with his future brother-in-law, Thomas Poynton Ives, and served in the state legislature as a Federalist. After inheriting his father's estate in 1791, Brown became such a great benefactor to the school that it was renamed Brown University for him in 1804 when he donated $5,000 to the college. His total gifts to the college totaled over $150,000. Brown also co-founded the Providence Athenaeum and was active in various Baptist and literary causes. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Personal life He was married to Ann Carter (1770‚Äì1798), daughter of John Carter (1745‚Äì1814), a prominent printer in Providence. Together, they had: * Nicholas Brown III (1792‚Äì1859), who married his 2nd cousin, Abby Mason (1800-1822), daughter of James Brown Mason (1775‚Äì1819), in 1820.

It reached No. 59 on the UK album charts. Overview Allmusic referred to PXR5 as \\"the last in the sequence of brittle, pop-inflected records the band launched with Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music\\", saying that Hawkwind \\"both understood and allowed themselves to absorb the energies of new wave\\" on PXR5. The album was recorded and mixed at Rockfield Studios in January and February 1978. \\"Uncle Sam's on Mars\\", \\"Robot\\" and \\"High Rise\\" were originally recorded on the preceding UK tour but were partly overdubbed in the studio, particularly Robert Calvert's double-tracked vocals. \\"Infinity\\" and \\"Life Form\\" were originally to have been part of a solo album Dave Brock was working on. After the album was recorded and mixed, the band split up during a US tour in March when Simon House left to join David Bowie's band and Robert Calvert suffered a bout of clinical depression. With the band in temporary hiatus and no pending promotional tour, the album's release was shelved. The band re-emerged in mid-1978 as the Hawklords to record the 25 Years On album. Two tracks were released as singles, \\"Psi Power\\" and \\"25 Years\\", which featured \\"Death Trap\\" and \\"PXR5\\" respectively on their B-sides. The PXR5 album was eventually released on 15 June 1979, and the cryptic message on the cover \\"This is the last but one\\" refers to the fact that it was recorded prior to 25 Years On. The album's cover featured a British BS 1363 mains plug wired in a dangerous way. Shortly after the album's release, the illustration of the plug was covered by a sticker obscuring the image. Lyrical references *The lyrics of \\"Jack of Shadows\\" are inspired by Roger Zelazny's book Jack of Shadows. *\\"Uncle Sam's on Mars\\" evolved from the Neu!-esque \\"Opa Loka\\", with a Calvert- penned anti-US rant over the top of it. Its first performance was at the Cardiff Castle Festival in summer 1976 as \\"Vikings on Mars\\", read by Calvert from his clipboard notes, and with the aid of a megaphone, on stage after \\"Opa Loka\\". \\"Robot\\" also made a brief appearance as a poem at this historic gig. The song title itself is a twist on Gil Scott-Heron's \\"Whitey on the Moon\\". *\\"Infinity\\" uses a Calvert poem from Space Ritual. *\\"Robot\\" references Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. *The lyrics of \\"High Rise\\" are inspired by J.G. Ballard's book High-Rise and short story \\"The Man on the 99th Floor\\". *The lyrics of \\"PXR5\\" deal with Hawkwind's transitional period between Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music and Quark, Strangeness and Charm. CD Versions The Virgin CD issue was mastered with tapes different from those used for the original vinyl version. The most notable difference is that \\"High Rise\\" is the live version without studio overdubs, so starts with a clunk rather than the smooth bass intro and has a coarser vocal from Calvert. Also \\"PXR5\\" gains an introduction that's missing from the original. The Atomhenge CD issue restores the original version of the album, and includes the different versions of \\"High Rise\\" and \\"PXR5\\" as bonus tracks 14 and 15 respectively.

Background and role in genocide  An ethnic Hutu, Mpiranya was born in Gitarama prefecture. In 1993, he held the rank of major in the Rwandan Armed Forces and was second-in-command of military operations and intelligence (S2 and S3) in the Presidential Guard Battalion. Later the same year, he was appointed Commander of the Presidential Guard Battalion.Indictment against Mpiranya from the ICTR The ICTR indictment alleges that between 1990 and 1994, Mpiranya and other officers conspired to exterminate the Tutsi civilians and political opponents, and helped to train interahamwe and militia groups who committed the genocide. On 5 January 1994, the day that the Broad-Based Transitional Government specified by the Arusha Accords was to be sworn in, Mpiranya prevented the access of political opponents onto the premises of the Conseil national de d√©veloppement, particularly Lando Ndasingwa and his Liberal Party. This had the result that the only member of the Transitional Government who had been sworn in was President Habyarimana. After Habyarimana's death and the start of the genocide, members of the Presidential Guard presumedly led by Mpiranya \\"tracked down, arrested and killed\\" Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. They also took into custody 10 Belgian peacekeepers from UNAMIR who had been guarding her house, who were later gruesomely killed.[Scott Peterson: Me against my brother. New York, Routledge, 2002, p. 292 They were accompanied in this by members of the Para-Commando Battalion and the A company of the Reconnaissance Battalion, led by Captain Innocent Sagahutu. Simultaneously, other members of the presidential guard and other army units undertook similar actions against other opposition figures. On the morning of 7 April, Mpiranya was told by members of the Presidential Guard that Faustin Rucogoza, the Minister of Information, and his wife were presently being detained at the Presidential Guard camp. He allegedly responded by asking his soldiers why they were keeping them. Shortly afterwards, both were killed in the camp.  After the genocide  Mpiranya fled Rwanda after the RPF victory. For several years Mpiranya was still at large and believed to be with other Rwandan √©migr√©s in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or in Zimbabwe. On 25 September 2002, Mpiranya was indicted by the U.N.'s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). He was charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Mpiranya remained at large and was one of the most wanted men by the Tribunal.\\"The Hague Justice Portal ‚Äì Mpiranya, Protais\\" The US government put a prize on his head in the Rewards for Justice Program.\\"Protais Mpiranya ‚Äì Wanted Up to $5 Million Reward\\"  Shelter in Zimbabwe  In February 2010, Mpiranya was reported by Belgian authorities to be sheltered by the Zimbabwean government, operating businesses in Harare, on top of acting as mercenary for the ruling party ZANU-PF to silence the opposition. In August 2010, Rwanda appealed for United Nations intervention in its diplomatic row after the Zimbabwean government refused to extradite Protais Mpiranya to the ICTR. Mpiranya allegedly stayed in Norton, about 40 km west of the capital Harare, where he allegedly stayed since his arrival in Zimbabwe in 2001. Security sources said that the Harare authorities were not keen on giving up the fugitive to whom they feel indebted over his reconnaissance role during the 1998‚Äì2001 Democratic Republic of Congo civil war. Mpiranya was instrumental during the DRC war after he worked side by side with southern African Allied forces, which included Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. He is believed to have supplied strategic information about the Rwandan military and also mobilised and trained Rwandans in refugee camps in eastern DRC to fight against the Rwandan army. Rwanda's Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga said the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda (ICTR) should move and bring Proitas Mpiranya to book. The two nations backed opposite sides in the DRC war. The row escalated after Zimbabwe accused Rwandan secret agents of illegally entering the country in pursuit of Mpiranya. Kigali denied the allegations, saying it would follow proper procedures to seek the extradition of Mpiranya. This was the second time that Zimbabwe has refused to extradite African officials accused of genocide in their own countries. It has refused to hand over former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam who is wanted in his country for mass murder. Despite a Zimbabwean official denying he was in the country in 2011, Zimbabwe's police announced in September 2012 that they have commenced a manhunt for Mpiranya. The UN's war crimes tribunal on Rwanda offered a USD5 million for his capture.

He was the 1986 American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year for the Blue Jays, a campaign in which he set team records for rookie relief in ERA, games, wins, and strikeouts. Career Eichhorn made his major league debut for the Blue Jays in 1982 but suffered a severe shoulder injury and did not return to the majors until 1986. The shoulder injury had robbed Eichhorn of most of his fastball velocity and had forced him to turn to an unconventional sidearm motion in which his arm angle was well below the belt when he released the ball. Eichhorn was notable for an exceptionally low velocity for a major league pitcher but his control and unusual delivery made him an effective player. Eichhorn pitched for four different ballclubs during his career: the Toronto Blue Jays (1982, 1986‚Äì1988, 1992‚Äì1993), Atlanta Braves (1989), California Angels (1990‚Äì1992, 1996), and Baltimore Orioles (1994). Eichhorn appeared in his final game on September 14, 1996. Eichorn was a solid fielding pitcher in his 11-year major league career, posting a .992 fielding percentage, committing only two errors in 243 total chances over 885.2 innings and 563 games. His only two miscues occurred on August 19, 1987 against the Oakland A's and on July 4, 1992 against the Toronto Blue Jays. Eichhorn is currently the pitching coach for Aptos High School in Aptos, California. Children Mark coached his 12-year-old son, Kevin, on the Aptos Little League team which won the Little League West Regional and played in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 2002, as chronicled in the movie Small Ball. Kevin was later drafted in the third round, number 104 overall, by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2008 MLB Draft, deciding to sign instead of attending Santa Clara University, where he had been committed since his junior year of high school. On January 24, 2011, Kevin was traded to the Detroit Tigers organization in a deal for pitcher Armando Galarraga, pitching through the 2014 season, finishing with a career mark of 26-23 and a 3.73 ERA in 89 games. Mark has five children, four sons and one daughter. Kevin (1990), Brian (1991), Steven (1995), Sarah (1999), and David (2001). Kevin also has a band named, \\"Soul Wise,\\" and they're on Spotify.

There also exist Indian variants of the story. The morals at the end of the fable have provided both English and French with proverbs and the story has been applied to a variety of social situations. The fable A dog that is carrying a stolen piece of meat looks down as it is walking beside or crossing a stream and sees its own reflection in the water. Taking that for another dog carrying something better, it opens its mouth to attack the \\"other\\" and in doing so drops what it was carrying. An indication of how old and well-known this story was is given by an allusion to it in the work of the philosopher Democritus from the 5th century BCE. Discussing the foolish human desire for more, rather than being content with what one has, he describes it as being \\"like the dog in Aesop's fable\\".Geert van Dijk, Ainoi, logoi, mythoi: fables in archaic, classical, and Hellenistic Greek, Brill NL 1997, p.320 Many Latin versions of the fable also existed and eventually the story became incorporated into mediaeval animal lore. The Aberdeen Bestiary, written and illuminated in England around 1200 (see above), asserts that \\"If a dog swims across a river carrying a piece of meat or anything of that sort in its mouth, and sees its shadow, it opens its mouth and in hastening to seize the other piece of meat, it loses the one it was carrying\\".Aberdeen University Library MS 24, Folio 19v.

The fable was invariably referred to in Greek sources as \\"The dog carrying meat\\" after its opening words (ŒöœçœâŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒ≠Œ±œÇ œÜŒ≠œÅŒøœÖœÉŒ±), and the moral drawn there was to be contented with what one has.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-latin Fable III, pp.174-8 Latin sources often emphasised the fact that the dog was taken in by its own reflection (simulacrum) in the water, with the additional moral of not being taken in by appearances. Other words used to mean reflection have contributed to the alternative title of the fable, \\"The Dog and its Shadow\\". In the Latin versions of Walter of England,Fable 5 Odo of CheritonFable 61 and Heinrich Steinh√∂wel's Aesop,Aesop p.50 for example, the word umbra is used. At that time it could mean both reflection and shadow, and it was the latter word that was preferred by William Caxton, who used Steinh√∂wel‚Äôs as the basis of his own 1384 collection of the fables.Fable 1.5 However, John Lydgate, in his retelling of the fable earlier in the century, had used \\"reflexion\\" instead.Isopes Fabules (1310), stanza 135 In his French version of the story, La Fontaine gave it the title Le chien qui l√¢che sa proie pour l'ombre (The dog who relinquished his prey for its shadow VI.17),WikiSource where ombre has the same ambiguity of meaning. Thereafter, and especially during the 19th century, the English preference was to use the word shadow in the fable's title. By this time, too, the dog is pictured as catching sight of himself in the water as he crosses a bridge. He is so represented in the painting by Paul de Vos in the Museo del Prado, dating from 1638/40,Wiki Commons and that by Edwin Henry Landseer, which is titled \\"The Dog and the Shadow\\" (1822), in the Victoria and Albert Museum.V&A; siteF.G. Stephens, Memoirs of Sir Edwin Landseer a Sketch of the Life of the Artist, London 1874, pp.76-7 Critics of La Fontaine had pointed out that the dog could not have seen its reflection if it had been paddling or swimming across the stream, as described in earlier sources, so crossing by a bridge would have been necessary for it to do so.Rue des fables However, a bridge had already been introduced into the 12th-century Norman-French account of Marie de FranceMary Lou Martin, The Fables of Marie de France: An English Translation, \\"De cane et umbra\\", pp.44-5 and Lydgate was later to follow her in providing that detail. Both also followed a version in which it is a piece of cheese rather than meat that the dog carries. Indian analogues An illustration of the Eastern story from Kalila and Dimna A story close to Aesop's is inserted into the Buddhist scriptures as the Calladhanuggaha Jataka, where a jackal bearing a piece of flesh walks along a river bank and plunges in after the fish it sees swimming there. On returning from its unsuccessful hunt, the jackal finds a vulture has carried off its other prey.Joseph Jacobs, The fables of √Üsop, selected, told anew and their history traced, London, 1894, p.199 A variation deriving from this is Bidpai's story of \\"The Fox and the Piece of Meat\\".Maude Barrows Dutton, The Tortoise and the Geese and Other Fables of Bidpai, New York 1908, p.30 There a fox is on its way home with the meat when it catches sight of some chickens and decides to hunt one of them down; it is a kite that flies off with the meat it had left behind in this version. Proverbial morals In his retelling of the story, Lydgate had drawn the lesson that the one \\"Who all coveteth, oft he loseth all\\",fable VII, line 3 He stated as well that this was \\"an olde proverb\\"The Oxford Dictionary Of English Proverbs (1949), p.36 which, indeed, in the form \\"All covet, all lose\\", was later to be quoted as the fable's moral by Roger L'Estrange.Aesop‚Äôs Fables (1689), \\"A Dog and a Shadow\\", p.5 Jean de la Fontaine prefaced his version of the fable with the moral it illustrates before proceeding to a brief relation of the story. The point is not to be taken in by appearances, like the dog who attacks his reflection and falls into the water. As he struggles to swim to shore, he relaxes his grip on his plunder and loses \\"shadow and substance both\\".Norman Shapiro, The Complete Fables of Jean de La Fontaine, Fable VI.17, p.146 An allusive proverb developed from the title: L√¢cher sa proie pour l‚Äôombre (giving up the prey for the shadow). When this idiom was glossed in a dictionary of gallicisms, however, it was given the English translation, \\"to sacrifice the substance for the shadow\\",Elisabeth Pradez, Dictionnaire des Gallicismes, Paris 1914, p.191 which is based on the equally proverbial opposition between shadow and substance found in English versions of the fable. Aphra Behn, in summing up Francis Barlow's 1687 illustrated version of \\"The Dog and Piece of Flesh\\", coalesced the ancient proverb with the new: ::The wishing Curr growne covetous of all. ::To catch the Shadow letts the Substance fall.p.161 In Roger L'Estrange‚Äôs relation of \\"The Dog and a Shadow\\", \\"He Chops at the Shadow and Loses the Substance\\"; Brooke Boothby, in his translation of the fables of Phaedrus, closes the poem of \\"The Dog and his Shadow\\" with the line \\"And shade and substance both were flown\\".Fables and Satires (Edinburgh 1809), vol.1, p.7 The allusive proverb is glossed as \\"Catch not at shadows and lose the substance\\" in a recent dictionary.Martin H. Manser, The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs, Infobase Publishing, 2007, p.416 One other author, Walter Pope in his Moral and political fables, ancient and modern (1698), suggested that the alternative proverb, \\"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\\", could be applied to the dog‚Äôs poor judgment.\\"The Dog and Shadow\\", Fable 14 Alternative applications The dog swimming in the 1564 edition of Hieronymus Osius 16th-century emblem books used illustrations in order to teach moral lessons through the picture alone, but sometimes found pictorial allusions to fables useful in providing a hint of their meaning. So in his Book of Emblemes (1586), the English poet Geoffrey Whitney gives to his illustration of the fable the Latin title Mediocribus utere partis (Make use of moderate possessions) and comments in the course of his accompanying poem, ::Whome fortune heare allottes a meane estate, ::Yet gives enowghe eache wante for to suffise: ::That wavering wighte, that hopes for better fate, ::And not content, his cawlinge doth despise, :::Maie vainlie clime, but likelie still to fall, :::And live at lengthe with losse of maine and all.Emblem 39 Others also treated the subject of being content with what one already has in an emblematic way. They include Latin versions of the fable by Gabriele Faerno, whose De Canis & Caro warns not to prefer the uncertain to the sure (Ne incerta certis anteponantur);Centum fabulae (1563), Fable 53 Hieronymus Osius, with his comment that the more some folk have, the more they want (Sunt, qui possideant cum plurima, plura requirunt);Fabulae Aesopi carmine elegiaco redditae (1564), poem 5 and Arnold Freitag, who points out the stupidity of changing the sure for the uncertain (Stulta certi per incertum commutatio).Mythologia Ethica (1579) pp.112-113 At a later date the financial implications of \\"throwing good money after bad\\" for uncertain gain were to be summed up in the English phrase \\"It was the story of the dog and the shadow\\".Brewer‚Äôs Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1868), p.366-7 The fable was also capable of political applications as well. John Matthews adapted the fable into an attack on \\"the brain-sick Demagogues\\" of the French Revolution in pursuit of the illusion of freedom.Fables from La Fontaine, in English verse (1820), p.253 In a British context, during the agitation running up to the 1832 Reform Act, a pseudonymous 'Peter Pilpay' wrote a set of Fables from ancient authors, or old saws with modern instances in which appeared a topical retelling of \\"The Dog and the Shadow\\". Dedicated \\"to those who have something\\", it turned the fable's moral into a conservative appeal to stick to the old ways.The Ten Pounder 1, Edinburgh 1832, pp.87-8 And in the following decade, a member of parliament who had given up his place in order to stand unsuccessfully for a more prestigious constituency was lampooned in the press as \\"most appropriately represented as the dog in the fable who, snatching at the shadow, lost the substance\\".An Illustrative Key to the Political Sketches of H.B. (London, 1841), item 484, p.335 More recently, the fable has been used to teach a psychological lesson by the Korean choreographer Hong Sung-yup. In his ballet \\"The Dog and the Shadow\\" (2013) the lost meat represents the accumulated memories which shape the personality.Korea Herald, 12 June 2013 That same year, the fable figured as the third movement of five in the young Australian composer Alice Chance‚Äôs \\"Aesop‚Äôs Fables Suite\\" for viola da gamba.Carolyn McDowall, \\"Alice, a Young Composer ‚Äì Taking a Chance on a Musical Life\\", The cultural concept circle, 29 May 2013 References External links * 15th-20th century illustrations from books * 17th-20th century French Prints Category:Aesop's Fables Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:Jataka tales Category:Fictional dogs Category:Animals in Buddhism ","title":"The Dog and Its Reflection"},{"id":"4259196","text":": This page is about an album by Hawkwind. For sonic weapons, see Sonic weapon. Sonic Attack is the eleventh studio album by the English space rock group Hawkwind, released in 1981. It spent five weeks on the UK albums chart peaking at #19. After the departure of drummer Ginger Baker and keyboardist Keith Hale following the previous album Levitation, former Hawklords drummer Martin Griffin accepted the opportunity to re-join the group, while guitarist Dave Brock and bassist Harvey Bainbridge decided to forgo a dedicated keyboardist and to handle synthesisers and sequencers themselves. The album was recorded June through August 1981 at Rockfield Studios, but during recording drummer Griffin contracted German measles, curtailing his contributions and resulting in him having to overdub some of his drum parts. Of Brock's tracks, Bainbridge explained the recording process as \\"Dave turned up with his eight track, dumped what he had onto the multi-track and the rest of us somehow had to play around what he'd done\\". Science fiction author Michael Moorcock, a long-standing associate of the group, contributes lyrics and vocals to the album, his theme being social control through the use of language. Musically it is one of the group's most heavy metal-influenced albums. The title track, \\"Sonic Attack\\", is a re-recording of the Space Ritual spoken piece with a new electronic backing. \\"Virgin of the World\\" is credited as being from Church of Hawkwind, and it appeared on that album in a different form as \\"Experiment with Destiny\\". \\"Angels of Death\\" was released as a single backed by the non-album \\"Transdimensional Man\\". The group undertook a 28 date UK tour in September and October to promote the album, with support from Mama's Boys. An additional seven date Christmas followed, which saw former members Robert Calvert, Nik Turner and Moorcock guest on the London Rainbow date. A 13 date European tour in March 1982 followed, supporting Krokus.

It did not obey orders to merge with the Home Army in 1944 and was a part of the Military Organization Lizard Union faction. Its soldiers fought simultaneously with the Nazi German and the communist underground. Second Polish Republic background In 1934, within the National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe, SN), a secret radically right-wing faction emerged, known as the Internal Organization. They were critical in respect to the democratic traditions of the SN and in April 1934 gave rise to the splinter National Radical Camp (Ob√≥z Narodowo Radykalny, ONR). The movement was quickly delegalized by the Sanation regime and many ONR activists ended up in the Bereza Kartuska camp for political opponents. In 1935 the ONR split further into the National Radical Camp Falanga and the National Radical Camp \\"ABC\\", the latter dominated by members of the Internal Organization. The ONR \\"ABC\\" promoted an extreme \\"social-national\\" ideology, which included the call for expulsion of the ethnic minorities in Poland, specifically in the Kresy macro- region especially the Germans, Lithuanians, Belarusians, Ukrainians and Jews, and allowing only ethnically pure Polish members of the organization in state leadership positions.Rafa≈Ç Wnuk: Brygada ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska. Zak≈Çamana legenda [The Holy Cross Mountains Brigade. A falsified legend.] Gazeta Wyborcza: Ale historia 25.01.2016. World War II background Soldiers of the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade in parade (1945) After the Polish defeat in September 1939, the ONR \\"ABC\\" people formed the conspiratorial Szaniec Group. They refused to recognize the authority of the Polish government-in-exile. Szaniec's Military Organization Lizard Union (ZJ) did not become associated with the Home Army (AK), the main Polish underground force. Together with a splinter group from the National Military Organization (NOW) they created the National Armed Forces (NSZ), but the NSZ leaders soon became engaged in rivalry and disagreements over the issue of reaching an understanding with the Polish Underground State and acknowledging the Home Army command, which the individuals from the Lizard Union continued to refuse to do. The rivalry became violent to the point of the Szaniec faction murdering NSZ officers who joined the AK. The split resulted in the establishment of a conspiracy known as the NSZ-ONR, whose leaders, obsessively preoccupied with the issues of treason and pro-communist \\"fifth column\\" even killed the top NSZ commander, Stanis≈Çaw Nakoniecznikow, whom they previously installed themselves. At the time of the formal Polish-Soviet alliance (1941‚Äì43), the \\"NSZ Declaration\\" equally considered Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union enemies and stressed the organization's determination to fight communist attempts to establish their rule in Poland. Creation The Soviet military successes on the Eastern Front caused the NSZ to adjust its program in mid-1943. Because of indirectly benefiting the Soviet Union, anti-German activities were to be discouraged. The main enemies were now considered to be the Soviet Union and its \\"communist agencies\\" in Poland: the Gwardia Ludowa (GL) and its successor Armia Ludowa (AL), the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and the Soviet partisans, who were active also in Poland. Lacking a large military unit, the nationalists issued on 11 August 1944 an order establishing the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade. The brigade was created in August 1944 in the Kielce region out of the 204th infantry battalion and Special Action Groups of the NSZ-ZJ. It varied in number from 822 soldiers in December 1944 to 1418 soldiers in May 1945. The purpose of the brigade was the realization of the political and military program of the NSZ. The commander of the brigade was Colonel Antoni Szacki (\\"Bohun-Dabrowski\\"). Military engagements in Poland Holy Cross Mountains Brigade cap badge The formation fought against the Germans (among others at Brze≈õcie, Zagna≈Ñsk, Cac√≥w, and Marcinkowice), the Soviet NKVD forces, the Polish communist partisans of the Armia Ludowa (at Fanis≈Çawice and Bor√≥w)Encyklopedia PWN (2017), Brygada ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska. and once against the peasant partisans of the Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie (BCh) when they cooperated with communist partisans. Although the brigade occasionally fought the Germans, it avoided confrontations with the occupier and stressed a \\"clearing of the Polish territories of red banditry\\". The brigade's major success was its defeat of a joint Armia Ludowa and Soviet partisans force in a battle fought on 8 September 1944 near RzƒÖbiec. The battle took place after a patrol of the brigade was captured by the communist formations, and its members tortured and slated for summary execution. One of the captured prisoners managed to escape and alerted the brigade to the situation. The brigade attacked and defeated the AL and Soviet soldiers. The Soviet captives were executed and several Poles of the AL who were accused of banditry as well. Thirteen of the captured Polish communists joined the brigade.Wojciech Muszy≈Ñski, Rafa≈Ç Sierchu≈Ça (1 August 2008), Brygada ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska NSZ. Dodatek specjalny IPN. Warsaw, Gazeta Polska. In individual actions units of the brigade killed several hundred members and sympathizers of the PPR and the AL, in what one historian, Rafa≈Ç Wnuk, described as a bloody and brutal civil war fought between communists and nationalists in the Kielce province. Evacuation out of Poland As the Soviet Red Army approached Poland, the leaders of the NSZ-ONR decided to evacuate the brigade to the territories controlled by the Western Allies. In January 1945 it began a retreat through Silesia into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. At first the brigade was attacked by the Germans because it lacked their permission for the movement. By January 15 the consent was obtained and the retreat continued. The partisans received German food rations and accepted Wehrmacht and Gestapo liaison officers to accompany them during the trip. In April 1945, now in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the brigade found itself in an area surrounded by substantial German forces and its German contacts began insisting on closer collaboration. As a result, the commanders of the brigade agreed to a limited plan whereby small units of the force were to cross or be parachuted by the Germans back into Poland in order to carry out intelligence work and possibly sabotage at the rear of the advancing Red Army. According to former soldiers, they were all instructed by the brigade's command to ignore their German assigned tasks once in Poland and instead try to make contact with NSZ headquarters. Out of the units sent, two turned around and made their way back to the main force, while several ran into Soviet and Polish communist forces and were liquidated. During the same period, the second in command, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Marcinkowski pseudonym \\"Jaxa\\", took part in a German sponsored conference involving various collaborationist and fascist organizations during which, according to Marcinkowski, the Germans made an offer of forming a Vlasov style formation out of the brigade. Marcinkowski refused the offer and tried to stall by claiming not to have the authority to agree to it. According to the historian Rafa≈Ç Wnuk, the brigade command dispatched about one hundred men to the German intelligence Abwehr training center, from where most of them were sent or were in process of being sent to Poland for anti-Soviet diversionary activities. The 25th Polish Auxiliary Guard cap badge. After the end of World War II, the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade became the 25th Polish Auxiliary Guard Company of the United States Army in occupied Germany. Marcinkowski, along with Hubert Jura, pseudonym \\"Tom\\", who was the main liaison officer between the Germans and the brigade, were members of the extreme-right faction Szaniec within the NSZ-ZJ (which was itself a far-right faction of the pre-1944 NSZ). Jura's role in the actions undertaken by the unit during this time have not been fully explained. Jura was a Gestapo or SD agent and he used internal politics of the NSZ-ZJ to settle personal scores (under the guise of \\"fighting communism within NSZ- ZJ\\"). There were outstanding death sentences for collaboration issued against him by both the Home Army and the portion of the pre-1944 NSZ which merged with it. While the brigade was in Bohemia, Col. Szacki made contacts with the anti-German Czech underground and became involved in clandestine plans for an uprising in Plze≈à. On May 5 the Brigade liberated a part of the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp at Hol√Ω≈°ov. The brigade made contact with the U.S. Third Army on May 6, 1945. On the following day, the brigade fought alongside troops of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division in the assault that liberated Plze≈à and restored it to Czechoslovakia. Following the end of the war in Europe, the presence of the brigade in Czechoslovakia became a contentious political issue for the U.S. forces. The British War Office declined to accept the brigade as a reinforcement unit for the Polish forces under their command. On August 6, 1945, the brigade was disarmed and moved to a displaced persons camp in Coburg. Subsequently, men of the brigade were used in the formation of 25 Polish guard companies in the American-occupied zone of Germany. The U.S. CIC kept tabs on the brigade's leadership during this time as the U.S. Army did not want any incidents with the Soviet forces. The brigade was demobilized on June 17, 1946 and, under the pressure from communist diplomacy, most of the Polish guard companies were disbanded in 1947. Some of the senior officers of the brigade resettled in the United States.David R. Morgan. Todd Morgan: The Anabasis of the Holy Cross Brigade Reflected in the Documents of the United States Government. Glaukopis 5-6 (2006): 242-275; published in Polish in PrzeglƒÖd Historyczno-Wojskowy Kwartalnik Nr.2 (2006): 113-134. The Holy Cross Mountains Brigade tried to join the Polish Armed Forces in the West, but the Polish government-in-exile in London did not agree to allow members of a formation which did not cooperate with the Home Army, did not recognize the Polish Underground State, and collaborated with the Germans to become recognized combatants of the Polish Armed Forces. In the years that followed, the brigade veterans repeatedly sought the status of former Polish soldiers but their petitions were denied until 1988. Accusations of and extent of Nazi collaboration  Extent of collaboration  Documents uncovered in the German Federal Archives in Koblenz contain correspondence between the Gestapo and the NSZ (National Armed Forces) indicating close collaboration as far as tracking Jews was concerned. This included in particular the Holy Cross Mountain brigade in the district of Radom. By the end of 1943 and beginning of 1944, the cooperation of the brigade with the German police in the Radom district acquired a permanent character. This cooperation included the lookout for Jews hiding in the forests to deliver to the Germans. In 1944, members of the High Command of the Home Army were abducted from their offices by the NSZ and handed to the Germans. During the closing days of the war, on 13 January 1945, the 850-strong Brigade began, with German approval and under German protection, the trek westward through Silesia to Czechoslovakia. They were permitted to continue to march southwest to Bohemia, where their unit was confined at an encampment in March. The collapsing Third Reich was hoping to use the Holy Cross Brigade for propaganda purposes and to deploy it at the front On 6 May 1945, the Holy Cross Brigade made its way to the American- occupied zone of Germany. The Polish command agreed to assign a small number of volunteer troops to be sent, including by air, behind the Soviet lines. The volunteers were given confidential orders to shoot any German assigned to them upon landing. In any event, no Germans were attached, and a small number that made it back to Poland promptly reported back to the NSZ leadership and re- entered the struggle against the communists. The brigade refused participation in the anti-German military Operation Tempest; this lack of participation was allegedly aimed at preventing the communist takeover of Poland. According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, there were no documented cases of Holy Cross Brigade soldiers directly murdering Polish Jews due to their ethnic origin. Representative of the veterans Jan J√≥zef Kasprzyk described the claims of Nazi collaboration as a product of postwar communist propaganda meant to smear the unit's legacy. This opinion was not agreed by prof. Andrzej Friszke.  Collaboration in Home Army reports  As stated in reports by the Polish Home Army, the brigade was well armed and trained and operated in an almost open environment, and its units were resented by the civilian population. The head of the intelligence service of the Home Army Kielce Inspectorate noted that the cooperation with the Gestapo \\"was basically open and individual commanders did not hide the fact that they received weapons and ammunition to fight against communism from the occupying authorities\\". A report of the commander of the Home Army in the Radom district from January 2, 1945 states: \\"The clear cooperation with Germans and the plague of the society as a result of the use of props. On November 22nd, during the march of the NSZ through Oleszno, the Germans pulled in the posts. Contacts with the Gestapo are recorded.\\" Another note of the Home Army reports on NSZ officers discussing the manhunts on the PPR.  Other  The agrarian People's Party, one of the main components of the Underground State, accused the NSZ and its Holy Cross Mountains Brigade of contacts with and enjoying support of the Germans. The movement's periodicals described the extreme nationalists as \\"openly treasonous\\", and of being a \\"political fascist creation\\". After the end of the war, the People's Party under the leadership of Wincenty Witos decided to support Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk. However at the same time Polish communists named one of their proxy parties , and the old People's Party, now loyal to Miko≈Çajczyk, changed its name into Polish People's Party (PSL). After Miko≈Çajczyk's defeat in the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election, the remains of the Polish People's Party were merged (in 1949) into the communist- allied United People's Party (ZSL).

Kl√ºver‚ÄìBucy syndrome may present with compulsive eating, hypersexuality, insertion of inappropriate objects in the mouth (hyperorality), visual agnosia, and docility. Symptoms The list of symptoms generally include the following: *Docility, characterized by exhibiting diminished fear responses or reacting with unusually low aggression. This has also been termed \\"placidity\\" or \\"tameness\\".Ozawa, 540. *Dietary changes and hyperphagia, characterized by eating inappropriate objects (pica), or overeating, or both.Ozawa, 540. *Hyperorality, described by Ozawa et al. as \\"an oral tendency, or compulsion to examine objects by mouth\\". *Hypersexuality, characterized by a heightened libido or a tendency to seek sexual stimulation from unusual or inappropriate objects. *Visual agnosia, characterized by an inability to recognize familiar objects or people. While this cluster of syndromes is common to such sources as 1997's The Neuropsychiatry of Limbic and Subcortical Disorders, 2005's Functional Neuroanatomy: Text and Atlas and 1997's \\"Single-Photon Emission CT and MR Findings in Kl√ºver-Bucy after Reye syndrome\\", an article in the American Journal of Neuroradiology, the three vary thereafter. Inconsistent criteria include: *Hypermetamorphosis, characterized by Ozawa et al. as \\"an irresistible impulse to notice and react to everything within sight\\". This is included under the classification systems described by The Neuropsychiatry of Limbic and Subcortical Disorders and \\"Single-Photon Emission CT and MR Findings in Kl√ºver-Bucy\\". *Amnesia, characterised by an inability to recall memories. This only occurs when the damage extends bilaterally into the hippocampus. In rhesus monkeys As part of an investigation by Heinrich Kl√ºver in the 1930s into the area affected by mescaline, Kl√ºver arranged to have the temporal lobes of a number of rhesus monkeys bilaterally removed by Paul Bucy, a neurosurgeon.Rockland, 45 Kl√ºver did not find the expected impact in response to mescaline, but did observe a series of changes in the subject animals. The six points of difference that Kl√ºver recorded were visual agnosia, an increased tendency to explore items by mouth, hypermetamorphosis, dampening of emotional expression, altered sexual behavior and differences in diet. Kl√ºver later discovered similar observations by Sanger Brown and Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer that had been published in 1881 and drew on these to substantiate his own observations.Rockland, 46. Monkeys in the Kl√ºver-Bucy experiment evidently had normal vision and motor skills, but exhibited \\"psychic blindness\\", what Rusiko Bourtchouladze described in 2004 as an inability to recognize \\"the emotional importance of events\\". They did not display fear for items that would ordinarily frighten members of their species; they displayed an appetite for improper foods such as rocks or live rats and sought intercourse with unusual partners, including members of other species. They became extremely interested in exploring items in their environment and became placid when approached. In humans Kl√ºver‚ÄìBucy syndrome was first documented among certain humans who had experienced temporal lobectomy in 1955 by H. Terzian and G.D. Ore. It was first noted in a human with meningoencephalitis in 1975 by Marlowe et al. Kl√ºver‚ÄìBucy syndrome can manifest after either of these (lobectomies can be medically required by such reasons as accidents or tumors), but may also appear in humans with acute herpes simplex encephalitis or following a stroke. Other conditions may also contribute to a diagnosis of Kl√ºver‚ÄìBucy syndrome, including Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, anoxia, progressive subcortical gliosis, Rett syndrome, porphyria and carbon monoxide poisoning, among others. It is rare for humans to manifest all of the identified symptoms of the syndrome; three or more are required for diagnosis. Among humans, the most common symptoms include placidity, hyperorality and dietary changes. They may also present with an inability to recognize objects or inability to recognize faces or other memory disorders. Social neurosciences research shows that changes in temporal lobe is identified as a cause for aberrant sexual and hyper-sexual behaviors.

She was studying criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Her murder captured national attention; together with the later murder of Jennifer Moore, it was a catalyst for passage of legislation to require background checks of bouncers in bars and a security plan for nightclubs. A bouncer was convicted of St. Guillen's murder. Life and murder Imette St. Guillen was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Seimundo Guillen and Maureen St. Hilaire. Her surname-and that of her elder sister- was a combination of their parents' surnames. Their mother was French Canadian. Their father, Seimundo Guillen, a Venezuelan immigrant, died of AIDS when Imette was nine years old. Her widowed mother later remarried. St. Guillen graduated from Boston Latin School in 1999 and moved to Washington, D.C. to attend George Washington University. Like her father, St. Guillen studied criminal justice. She graduated magna cum laude in 2003 and enrolled at John Jay College of Criminal Justice to pursue a master's degree. Although originally intending to study forensic psychology, St. Guillen changed her major to criminal justice. Ranked in the top 5% of her class, she was scheduled to graduate in May 2006. After celebrating her upcoming birthday with her mother and sister in Florida, St. Guillen took a plane back to New York. On February 24, 2006, St. Guillen met with her best friend Claire Higgins to continue celebrating her birthday, a few days away. Out at a nightclub around 3:30 a.m. on February 25, the two women argued over whether to go home. Higgins left; later, in a 3:50 a.m. phone call, St. Guillen assured Higgins that she would soon be leaving for home. She was last seen at 4:00 a.m at a bar named 'The Falls'. Seventeen hours after St. Guillen spoke with her friend, police in Brooklyn received an anonymous phone call alerting them to a dead woman's body on Fountain Avenue in Spring Creek Park. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved down her throat, and her head was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her hair had been cut off. An autopsy revealed that she had been beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer \\"tried to dehumanize her completely. ... Whenever you hide someone's face, it means that you don't want to see them as a human being. You want to pretend that they're just an object\\". The murder case of Imette St. Guillen was handled by the Special Victims Squad of the NYPD. Arrest The Falls South side door, from which Littlejohn allegedly led St. Guillen outside to his van. Darryl Littlejohn, one of two bouncers at The Falls where St. Guillen was seen the night she was murdered, was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, and unlawful imprisonment. DNA that was proven to be Littlejohn's, most likely caused from a nosebleed, was found in blood on the plastic ties used to bind St. Guillen's hands. Littlejohn was asked to escort St. Guillen out of The Falls just before closing, and was later seen talking to the young woman in front of the bar. His basement apartment in Queens and vehicles were searched by police and crime scene investigators. Carpet fibers found in Littlejohn's home were a match to fibers discovered on the adhesive tape wrapping St. Guillen's face. Additional evidence that Littlejohn was in the area at the time, date, and place where St. Guillen was killed and dumped was found using cell phone tower records. These \\"indicated movement from his home to near the spot in Brooklyn where Ms. St. Guillen's body was found.\\" Due to the nature of St. Guillen's murder and other high-profile cases, The Village Voice suggested that the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) was devoting more of its time to tracing the cellular phones of detectives. The article discussed efforts to uncover leaks to the media in these cases. A source that communicated with The Village Voice said that police in St. Guillen's murder case had received \\"punitive 'letters of instruction' in their files and were docked days of pay.\\" Littlejohn, an ex-convict, had spent more than 12 years in prison for drug possession and robbery charges. He was on parole at the time of his employment at The Falls and, by working late hours at the bar, was violating the curfew of his parole agreement. While he was initially held by authorities because of the parole violation. He was later charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder for the death of St. Guillen. During that time, Littlejohn was tried and convicted in the attempted abduction of a Queens woman on October 19, 2005; this abduction attempt was later linked to St. Guillen's case, as the woman called police after seeing the suspected van on TV news reports. Littlejohn's initial defense attorney was Kevin O'Donnell, but he was dismissed after Littlejohn complained about his work. Littlejohn's second lawyer, Joyce David, was known for her book What You Should Know If You're Accused of a Crime. She filed a 36-page legal brief on her defendant's behalf alleging a \\"wide-ranging conspiracy\\" related to Littlejohn and the St. Guillen murder. According to prosecutors, Littlejohn started his criminal career at age 12, first stealing a 70-year-old woman's purse with the help of a friend. Prosecutors in the 2005 abduction sought court permission to discuss Littlejohn's crimes, and prosecutor Frank DeGaetano said that the crimes \\"fairly reflect his character.\\" Littlejohn's lawyer wanted discussion of his past banned from the trial. License for The Falls bar During the investigation, there were revelations that The Falls bar manager, Daniel Dorrian, had allegedly lied about elements of St. Guillen's disappearance and murder. Jeff Ragsdale, a New York City writer, organized a group of people through Craigslist to start a protest demonstration in front of The Falls bar. The demonstrations lasted a few months, and around June 2006 The Falls bar lost its liquor license. The Pioneer bar was associated with the disappearance of St. Guillen that night, but it is not related to her murder. Nevertheless, the bar suffered negative publicity, and news reports showed images of its facade in coverage of the murder, leading the bar to change its name to the R Bar. Littlejohn's pre-trial and trial in previous abduction Littlejohn went on trial in 2007 for the 2005 abduction, which was held before the murder trial for St. Guillen. Observers were concerned that this suggested that St. Guillen's murder case was not strong enough. Prosecution, however, stated that they were prepared to proceed with the murder trial. In January 2009, Littlejohn was convicted of kidnapping a college student, Shanai Woodard, in October 2005. The victim testified that he had approached her while dressed as a police officer, handcuffed her, and forced her into a vehicle. She escaped. Littlejohn was sentenced to 25 years-to-life in prison. Trial Pre-trial hearings began on September 11, 2007. In January 2008, the judge assigned to St. Guillen's murder case, Cheryl Chambers, was reassigned to the state's Appellate Division. Littlejohn's defense attorney Joyce David challenged the autopsy findings as well as the search warrants giving police the authority to search Littlejohn's van, his apartment, and to investigate his cell phone records. Prosecutors were given permission by Justice Abraham Gerges to admit evidence from Littlejohn's other crimes. Opening arguments were given on May 11, 2009. Prosecution headed by Kenneth Taub laid out the case that Littlejohn was a sex fiend. According to the Daily News, Taub said that \\"He [Littlejohn] did the same thing to two other women three months before\\" and \\"Until this case, he got away with it.\\" They briefly described the circumstantial evidence against Littlejohn. Littlejohn wore glasses in the courtroom. Some defense lawyers have described this as the \\"nerd defense, which is a tactic used to make felons and other criminals appear less menacing to the jury during a trial.\\" The defense was headed by Joyce David, who said that the case was a \\"racially charged frame-up by police eager to close a blockbuster case,\\" according to the Daily News. David said, \\"He's a black man with a long criminal record,\\" and \\"Who's going to care about him?\\" David pointed her finger at bartender Daniel Dorrian of The Falls bar and said that \\"Darryl Littlejohn is being framed to protect Danny Dorrian\\". Prosecution's case Claire Higgins, St. Guillen's best friend, was among the first to take the witness stand. She described the time she had shared with St. Guillen on the night of her disappearance. Daniel Dorrian, manager of the bar where St. Guillen was last seen, indicated during the trial that Littlejohn and St. Guillen had \\"a screaming match\\" that night. According to the Daily News, \\"Dorrian insisted he didn't lie when he initially stonewalled cops about St. Guillen's kidnapping and murder.\\" However, he later admitted telling police that he did not remember St. Guillen being in The Falls bar, having attributed his initial statements to a fear of backlash against his bar. Defense lawyers suggested that Dorrian might have been the real killer and that St. Guillen might have returned to The Falls bar and \\"hooked up with Dorrian\\", though NYPD never investigated him as a possible suspect. Littlejohn's ex-girlfriend, Sandra Smith, testified on Thursday, May 14, the fourth day of the trial, testifying that after St. Guillen's death, he asked her to lie about using her Chrysler Sebring. Using cell phone tower records, detectives in the murder case determined that Littlejohn had been in the area of Fountain Avenue where St. Guillen's body was later found. Nicholas Petraco, a retired NYPD forensics evidence expert, testified about the presence of fibers from two coats and a jacket at Littlejohn's home in his van, on tape, and on a quilt, though he indicated that fiber analysis is not as good as DNA evidence. A representative of the medical examiner's office testified that Littlejohn's DNA was found on a snow brush found alongside St. Guillen's body, while Littlejohn's mother's hairs were on the quilt. Hairs were also identified as coming from eight other people. Medical examiner Ewelina Bajda said that traces of Littlejohn's blood were found in the locking mechanism of one of the zip-ties found in the Windstar used to bind St. Guillen. Prosecutors called several witnesses to testify to previous cases in which Littlejohn was alleged to have abducted young women. Woodard, the victim in the 2005 attack, testified about her kidnapping attempt, and the district attorney who prosecuted him testified about the evidence that had led to his conviction, though Justice Gerges warned jurors should not take Woodard's testimony as proof of Littlejohn's \\"propensity\\" to commit such crimes. Prosecutors later called a Japanese woman, also a student, who had been raped four months before St. Guillen's death in a manner similar to Woodard's case. David, who objected to both Woodard's and the Japanese woman's testimonies, verbally attacked the second victim's inability to identify Littlejohn in a lineup. While Littlejohn had not been charged in the Japanese student's attack, prosecutors insisted there was \\"compelling proof\\" that he was her attacker. Prosecution rested its case on May 28. Defense The defense continued to suggest that the DNA-testing of evidence that the city-hired firm, Bode Technology, may have been contaminated in order to frame Littlejohn and to clear bar manager Danny Dorrian. The prosecution criticized the defense's argument that police framed Littlejohn. David in reply said the evidence may suggest her client dumped the body, but it did not prove that Littlejohn killed her. After questioning two detectives about the 25-hour search for evidence in Littlejohn's residence, concluding that none of the more than 50 items confiscated was linked to St. Guillen, and DNA testing had failed to yield a match, the defense rested its case.  Verdict  Prosecutors had \\"presented proof that Littlejohn's blood, tissue and DNA were found on the plastic ties that were used to bind St. Guillen's hands.\\" The jury of six men and six women took less than seven hours to convict Littlejohn of murdering Imette St. Guillen and found him guilty of first degree murder. Before the jurors' verdict, David said to CNN that she believed in the innocence of her client. She repeated that Littlejohn was framed and another man was a likely suspect. Afterward, David said: \\"We're going to appeal. We're disappointed. I'm hoping this gives the family of the victim some closure. But I think that the wrong man was convicted.\\" Sentencing Speaking to St. Guillen's relatives, Judge Abraham G. Gerges said, \\"I hope that the conclusion of these proceedings today will provide you with some small measure of solace.\\" Judge Gerges directed comments to and about Littlejohn, calling him an unrepentant \\"predator\\" who should never taste freedom again. He sentenced him to life without parole. The Judge also paid tribute to St. Guillen, describing her as a 'promising woman who never deserved to die' saying, \\"If there were truly justice in this world, I would have the power to bring her back to you,\\" addressing Maureen and Alejandra, who cried in the courtroom. He said, \\"To my great sorrow, that is not possible.\\" \\"This defendant is not fit to remain in civilized society.\\" Gerges noted, > While the defendant committed this horrific crime, what is also so > disturbing about this case is the indifference of the people employed at the > bar that night. This court cannot speak to the legal implications of serving > someone who is intoxicated, and indeed that issue may be before another > judge, but this court can decry the complete indifference and inhumanity of > the workers there that night. They were all focused on finishing their shift > and leaving. Not one of those people spared a thought to the wisdom of > sending an intoxicated young woman out into the deserted streets of > Manhattan at 4 a.m. If only one of them had the common decency to call a > taxi, we might not be here in this courtroom today. Littlejohn is to serve his sentence consecutively with his previous 25-year- to-life term for kidnapping a Queens woman. David indicated after the sentencing that she would file a notice of appeal and indicated that Littlejohn remained silent. She maintained that he was framed to protect Dorrian. Civil lawsuits In 2009 St. Guillen's family settled a confidential suit they brought against The Falls bar in 2007. In early 2008, St. Guillen's mother brought a civil action against the federal government for US$200 million for their failure to keep track of Littlejohn under his parole. The suit names the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Program as defendants. The suit was dismissed in May 2010 by Court of Claims Judge Faviola A. Soto, quoting an NYS Appeals decision that reaffirmed the standard that, \\"an agency of government is not liable for the negligent performance of a governmental function unless there existed 'a special duty to the injured person, in contrast to a general duty owed to the public.'\\" In March 2011, the St. Guillen family settled with the Federal government for $130,000. Tracking software for post-release offenders was later named after St. Guillen. On the third anniversary of St. Guillen's death, her mother filed suit against the bounty hunter school, US Recovery Bureau Inc, accusing the proprietors, Ralph Rios and Robert Neves, of giving the accused, Darryl Littlejohn, fake badges that enabled him to get hired as a bouncer. Lastly, the St. Guillen family in March 2011 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Darryl Littlejohn. Legacy  Legislation  According to New York's NightLife Association, after St. Guillen's death, crime rates around bars and clubs in New York City had decreased. Her death was one of several high- profile incidents of women murdered after leaving a nightclub. The combined media scrutiny resulted in new and modified laws governing nightclub operations, including their screening of personnel. Soon after authorities realized that a bouncer may have been the perpetrator, nightclub owners and local politicians met to discuss ways to improve nightlife safety. In February 2007, New York City enacted a law requiring enhanced security and bouncer vetting. New York City club owners also agreed to voluntary guidelines which encourage the use of scanning machines to record the identification of their patrons and also encourage screening patrons for weapons. The guidelines provide for more care in dealing with intoxicated female patrons who are alone. The following month, Boston enacted a similar law, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino signed an executive order authorizing the cancellation of liquor licenses granted to anyone found to have hired a violent felon. A joint fundraising effort resulted in establishing the Imette St. Guillen Scholarship for second-year students at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Another scholarship in her name was endowed at Boston Latin School. St. Guillen's family has created the Spirit of Imette Foundation, intended to support education for underprivileged children.

The name change reflects the fact that this was a musical departure for the band, being a more experimental electronic offering rather than the usual heavy rock that the band were known for at the time. Dave Brock resurrects the \\"Dr Technical\\" alias which he had previously used for production of the band's 1972 hit single \\"Silver Machine\\". This is almost a Dave Brock solo album considering the heavy bias towards his work, and none of these tracks were performed live by the band, save \\"Looking in the Future\\" which was re-recorded as \\"Letting in the Past\\" on It is the Business of the Future to be Dangerous. \\"The Phenomenon of Luminosity\\" features a sample of John Glenn on the Friendship Seven spacecraft during the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission on 20 February 1962. An alternative version of \\"Experiment With Destiny\\" had appeared on the preceding year's Sonic Attack album as \\"Virgin of the World\\". Although credited to Dave Brock, the track \\"Some People Never Die\\" borrows much of its material from the track \\"They Call Me Gun\\" on an obscure LP by \\"On The Seventh Day\\" (US Mercury Records 61248, 1970), right down to the Robert F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald shooting commentaries. Alternative versions of \\"Some People Never Die\\" appear on Spacebrock and the Dave Brock solo album Earthed to the Ground (as \\"Assassination\\"). The CD bonus tracks on the 1994 Griffin release were recorded in the 1990s and seem at odds with the overall feel of the album, and they were placed in the middle of a resequenced side 2 disrupting the flow of the album, for example the rowing that linked \\"Some People Never Die\\" with \\"Light Specific Data\\" now has 5 tracks in between.

It is notable for being the first title released by Capcom for their CP System arcade game hardware. Plot Set in the 29th century, an evil god known as Bios has destroyed most of the Earth, turning it into a desolate wasteland known as the Dust World. Two nameless supersoldiers are created by the people to defeat Bios and the eight evil gods who serve him. Gameplay Forgotten Worlds can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The player controls a flying muscle-bound soldier armed with a rifle with unlimited ammo. The Player 1 character is equipped with a long-range automatic rifle, while Player 2 has a short-range wide shot. The controls in the original coin-op version consist of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the \\"roll switch\\". Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a \\"megacrush\\" attack which will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge. The player character is accompanied by a satellite module orbiting near him that will provide backup firepower every time the player fires their gun. Like the main character, the satellite can also be rotated with the roll switch. Rotating the character while firing will only rotate the aim of the satellite, while rotating the character without firing will not only rotate the satellite's aim, it will also move its relative position around the player. The player can obtain blue-colored coins known as Zenny from defeating enemies throughout the game. Zenny is used as currency to obtain new power-up items from shops located at certain points in each stage. When the player enters an item shop, they are given a choice of the items available and a limited time to make any purchase they wish. These items consist primarily of new weapons for the satellite module, but also include a health kit to restore lost vitality, armor that allows the player to sustain additional damage, and even tips on how to defeat the boss awaiting at the end of the current stage. Forgotten Worlds consists of nine stages each with its own boss. The player will lose if their vitality gauge runs out, but will be given a chance to continue. Development The game took two years to develop, with a production budget of 5 million. The game started off as a regular side-scrolling shooter, but Yoshiki Okamoto wanted a more imaginative game. During development, Capcom tried to make the game easier to play, having received criticism about how hard it was to dodge enemy projectiles in previous games. As this was the first game to use the CPS-1, Capcom tried to fully maximize its software capabilities. The game did not generate enough income upon its release due to large numbers of shooter games in the market and there were increased expenses due to a shortage of chips needed for the CPS-1 boards. Home versions Forgotten Worlds was first ported to various home computers in Europe by U.S. Gold in 1989. Versions were produced for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, TurboGrafx-16 and IBM-compatible PC. These versions of the game were developed by Arc Developments. The development team had four months to make the conversions. Every graphical frame was digitised directly from the arcade version's screen using a DigiView Gold device and stored the data on an Amiga 500 computer. The God of War was hand sketched, redrawn on the computer and colored with Deluxe Paint, although the mirroring function saved time. Even the shop scene was hand sketched from scratch. All the computer versions required a joystick controller in order to be played and could not be played with the keyboard only (with the exception of the IBM PC version, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC versions). The player rotated the character in these versions by holding the fire button while pushing the joystick left or right. In the Spectrum sales charts, it was number two, behind Robocop, which was number one every month for most of the year. A Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version, produced by Sega, was released in Japan on November 18, 1989, with subsequent releases in North America and the PAL region in 1990. The Mega Drive version simulated the controls of the arcade version by using A and C buttons to rotate the character in either direction and the B button for shooting. Unlike in the arcade version, both players are equipped with long-ranged automatic rifles. This version has only seven of the arcade's nine stages and provides an auto-fire feature that can be toggled on or off on the game's settings. In 2008, the Mega Drive version was released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America on November 17 and in Europe on November 28. A Master System version was also released by Sega in Europe and Brazil. This version is 1-player only and due to the presence of only two buttons on the Master System's standard controller, the buttons are used solely to rotate the character, who shoots automatically. The Megacrush attack is performed in this version by pressing both buttons simultaneously. The Turbografx-16 version, produced by NEC Avenue was released in Japan on March 27, 1992. It was released as a Super CD-ROM¬≤ title which supported a specialized 3-button controller that NEC released only in Japan. An American version for the TurboGrafx 16 was released by Turbo Technologies Inc. as well. With the 3-button controller, the player can control their character as they would in the Mega Drive version, with two buttons to rotate the character and one to shoot. With the standard TurboGrafx-16 controller, the Run button is used in the place of the third button to rotate the character to the left. The TurboGrafx-16 is one-player only, but allows the player to select between either of the two Unknown Soldiers at the start of the game (with their respective abilities from the arcade version retained). An emulation of the original arcade version is included in the 2005 compilation Capcom Classics Collection Vol.1 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as well as in 2006s Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed for the PlayStation Portable. Both, the PS2 and Xbox version, allows the player to use their respective controllers' right analog sticks to control the player character's aim. In 2008 the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was ported to the Wii console. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Forgotten Worlds on their September 1, 1988 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles like Sky Soldiers and Ninja Spirit. The game was met with highly positive reviews from critics. The Games Machine gave the Amiga version a score of 94%, praising the title's graphics and faithfulness to the arcade version.

Meyner (March 5, 1929 ‚Äì November 2, 1997), was a Democratic U.S. Representative from New Jersey from 1975 to 1979. As the wife of New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner, she was First Lady of New Jersey from 1957 to 1962. Biography She was born as Helen Stevenson on March 5, 1929 in Queens, New York. Her father was an Olympic gold medal winner and ambassador William Stevenson. She was a distant cousin of Democratic candidate for President Adlai Stevenson. She graduated from Colorado College. Later she married New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner on January 19, 1957 in Oberlin, Ohio. Meyner's work before entering politics included a career as a print and television journalist and work for the American Red Cross. Congress In 1972, Meyner ran as the Democratic nominee for Representative from New Jersey's newly redistricted 13th Congressional District that included her home in Phillipsburg and included Hunterdon, Sussex and Warren Counties and portions of Mercer and Morris Counties. She lost in the Republican-leaning district, to the Republican candidate, Joseph J. Maraziti. In 1974, with the Watergate scandal leading to Democratic congressional gains throughout the country, Meyner ran for the seat again, this time beating Maraziti. She won a second term in the 1976 elections in a close race against William E. Schluter, but lost her bid for a third term in 1978 to Republican James A. Courter. In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Meyner's name and picture. She died on November 2, 1997, in Fort Myers, Florida.  Service in the American Red Cross  Helen Stevenson Meyner's time as an American Red Cross (A.R.C.) nurse and Clubmobile worker are well documented in her own personal letters, found in the Meyner Papers collection at Lafayette College. In these letters she writes to her family about her time in Japan and Korea during the Korean War, giving a personal account of her duties and experiences working abroad in wartime.  Historical Context  = U.S. Occupation of Japan = Helen Stevenson Meyner's letters were written from 1950 to 1952 and they describe her time working as a Red Cross nurse in Japan and a Clubmobile Doughnut Dolly in Korea. Japan surrendered in 1945, which had seismic impacts on its economy and government system because there was a need for reconstruction after World War II. During the 1950s the United States occupied Japan and the U.S.-Japan alliance was created to aid in Japan's economic recovery post-bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The relationship between the United States and Japan ultimately shifted in the 1950s to allyship because the U.S. noticed that by investing in the reconstruction of Japan, they could eventually benefit from their economic success in the world market. As Japan's national state improved, Koreans in need of medical aid traveled to Japan to be treated by the A.R.C. Helen Stevenson Meyner worked as a nurse for the A.R.C. in Japan where she tended mainly to American troops who had suffered war injuries during the Korean War. A.R.C. nurses stationed in Japan oftentimes struggled due to a lack of resources and understaffed hospital units. The nurses had to work with what little resources they were given to treat a vast amount of patients, which resulted in most patients receiving subpar healthcare. Many of Helen Stevenson Meyner's letters to her parents described some of the difficulties she faced treating patients who faced extremely difficult medical conditions but were unable to get the best treatments due to limited resources. = The Korean War = The Korean War began on June 25, 1950 when Communist North Korea illegally traveled over the 38th parallel and invaded non-Communist South Korea. The Korean peninsula was split in 1948 when the Soviet Union and the United States created two sovereign nations where the North became Communist while the South was kept non-Communist. Helen Stevenson Meyner served on the American Red Cross Clubmobile Service in Korea, which was founded in World War II as a service that provided soldiers with food, entertainment, and a home away from home. Living conditions for soldiers were described as miserable because there was severe drought and high temperatures, which evidently killed off more Marine personnel than Korean war enemies. The idea of a mobile service club, or ‚ÄúClubmobile‚Äù, was devised by Harvey D. Gibson, a retired U.S. Army colonel, a popular New York banker and the American Red Cross Commissioner to Great Britain. Clubmobiles traveled throughout Great Britain and Europe between late 1942 and 1946. The work of women on Clubmobiles was considered to be very important because they were in charge of keeping up soldiers‚Äô morale during their off time at war and taking care of homesick GIs. The Clubmobile buses were described as ‚Äúsingle decker English Green Line buses fitted with coffee and doughnut-making equipment,‚Äù fitted with small things that soldiers may want during their time away from home, which included ‚Äúdoughnuts, coffee, cigarettes, magazines and newspapers, a phonograph with loudspeakers and records.‚Äù Meyner was considered a ‚ÄúDoughnut Dolly,‚Äù who were women that worked on Clubmobiles passing out doughnuts and coffee to Marines. In the novel by Helen Airy, Doughnut Dollies, Airy describes how Meyner was often ‚Äúswamped by returning first Marine Division men at the airstrip near Pusan, Korea while passing out coffee and doughnuts from an American Red Cross Clubmobile‚Äù through her research on Doughnut Dollies and accounts of Meyner's work.  Provenance  Helen Stevenson Meyner's letters from her time serving in the A.R.C. during the Korean War are found in the Meyner Papers, located in Skillman Library at Lafayette College. Items in this collection were brought to the College in multiple installments, starting with the arrival of Helen Stevenson Meyner's and her husband Robert Meyner's personal papers from their home in Phillipsburg, New Jersey 1992 and 1994. Then, in 1993, Meyner's papers from her time as a New Jersey congresswomen were transferred from the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library at Princeton University after being vetted and selectively weeded. The death of Helen Stevenson Meyner in 1997 brought more documents to the college, namely correspondence and images, in part aided by her sister Priscilla Hunt.\\"The Robert B. and Helen Stevenson Meyner Papers, 1910-1998.\\" Lafayette College Special Collections & College Archives.

These documents contain her experiences as a hospital nurse in Japan from 1950 to 1951 and a clubmobile worker in Pusan, Korea from 1951 to 1952, detailing her everyday responsibilities, her interactions with soldiers, and her thoughts about her work and the war overall. Throughout her time at the A.R.C., Meyner continuously expressed her discontent with the administration and the mistreatment of the volunteers. She discusses how highly qualified her fellow co-workers were and yet they were constantly disrespected by their superiors in the A.R.C. During her time in Japan, Meyner worked as a nurse in an American military hospital. As the hospital was severely understaffed and under-equipped, soldiers did not receive the health care that they needed, especially with regard to their mental wellbeing. Through her patients, Meyner learned of the chaos that was taking place happening in Korea. She emphasized that the western media coverage of the war was not reflecting the actual situation. In April 1951, Meyner arrived in Pusan, Korea, as a clubmobile. She served coffee and donuts to soldiers who were returning to the base. She describes Korea as ‚Äúdirty‚Äù and ‚Äúextremely impoverished‚Äù in comparison to Japan. Although her work was in recreational services, she was able to collect information about the war from soldiers. Meyner specifically reflected on her role as a white woman, often soldiers enjoyed her company due to the lack of American women serving in Korea. She indicates the diversity of the troops including soldiers from Sweden, Denmark, England, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, South Africa, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Thailand, Turkey, and Puerto Rico. However, the hierarchy within the military prioritized White American soldiers over other nationalities. Overall, she recognized some of the problems associated with United States actions including racial discrimination, disorganization, and lack of transparency with the American public. Meyner seems to have used her correspondence as a surrogate diary, and as such many letters contain multiple days‚Äô worth of experiences. There is a combination of written and typed letters, and in some instances there are written and typed versions of the same letter, is currently in the process of digitizing them The Special Collections staff at Skillman Library. Images of Meyner from this time period are not available in their physical form, but they are accessible in the online exhibit ‚ÄúCoffee, Doughnuts, and a Witty Line of Chatter.‚Äù  Further Research  = Other Projects = These documents have been used in several academic projects in order to expand research on the Korean War and women in war overall. Kathleen Stewart, a graduate student at Lehigh University, used Meyner's letters to write her master‚Äôs thesis in 1998. She focused on Helen Stevenson Meyner's A.R.C experience to tell a larger historical narrative about ‚Äúthe roles of women recreational workers played in sustaining the morale of soldiers in the war theater,‚Äù eventually earning her Master of Arts in history because of her work.Kathleen Stewart. Coffee, Doughnuts, and a Witty Line of Chatter: The Korean War Letters of Helen Stevenson Meyner (Lehigh University, 1998), 1. Recently in February 2019, Kara Dixon Vuic wrote the book The Girls Next Door: Bringing the Home Front to the Front Lines, which pulls from Helen Stevenson Meyner's letters as well as other women's writings in similar lines of wartime work to explore gender roles in the war environment. Vuic highlights Helen Stevenson Meyner in the chapter ‚ÄúDancing for Democracy,‚Äù where she puts the work of wartime entertainers in the context of the early Cold War and the Korean War and discusses the way sexuality was looked at during this time.Kara Dixon Vuic. The Girls Next Door: Bringing the Home Front to the Front Lines (Harvard College, 2019), 138-185. = Similar Collections = Aside from Helen Stevenson Meyner's own papers, her family's documents are available for those who wish to learn more about her life and the people in it. Robert Meyner's papers are available in two places: Skillman Library and the New Jersey State Archives located in Trenton, New Jersey. The former has documents ranging from personal papers to office records to images, while the latter has solely his gubernatorial papers from Robert Meyner's time as governor of New Jersey. These papers were used in the third volume of Statesmen and Mischief Makers, a series dedicated to telling the stories of government officials who made history in their respective sphere of influence, where there is a chapter about Robert's gubernatorial tenure and attempt at a Democratic presidential nomination in 1960.Scott Cass. Statesmen and Mischief Makers (Xlibris, 2016), 259-266. The collection of Helen Stevenson Meyner's parents, William and Eleanor Stevenson, are located at Oberlin College, and includes their personal correspondences, papers from their individual careers, and images. Eleanor's letters from her time as a Red Cross worker in World War II have been featured on the website Digitizing American Feminisms, a project run by Oberlin College that compiles student-written articles on specific documents that highlight elements of feminism through history. Her article uses twelve of her letters to showcase her advocacy and tie it to the Second Wave of feminism in America, specifically among white women.Ruby Boyd, Rachel Mead, Sarah Ulstrup.

He was the grandson of Taewang Jangsu (413‚Äì491). Though Munja's father Gochudaega Joda () had been named Crown Prince by Taewang Jangsu, Joda died before assuming the throne. He is considered as a ruler of Goguryeo at its zenith from Gwanggaeto the Great. In 472, Goguryeo had relocated its capital from the area around modern Ji'an along the upper Yalu River to Pyongyang (the modern capital of North Korea). This move came in the context of heightened rivalries with the other two of the Three Kingdoms, the then-allied Silla and Baekje. Maintaining the success of long-distance diplomacy of Jangsu, Munja nurtured close relations with Chinese dynasties, notably Northern Wei, Southern Qi and Liang. Though North Wei went through several wars with its northern neighbour, Rourans and Song, it finally disrupted further attacks of Song, resulting the shift into Liang dynasty. Because of power shift, Goguryeo initiated diplomatic ties with Liang also: the Book of Qi says the title was bestowed upon the king of Goguryeo, which means bilateral relationship was fulfilled within the two. Simultaneously, Munja continued to stabilize the occupation of Liaodong peninsular based on friendly relationship with North Wei. In terms of inter-Korean relationship, the 12th century Korean history the Samguk Sagi relates that the remnants of the Buyeo kingdom submitted to Goguryeo in 494 after their defeat by the nomadic Mohe people. After occupying Dongbuyeo (Eastern Buyeo) in Gwanggaeto's reign, Goguryeo finally completed subjugating whole Buyeo (current Harbin) area. In the meantime, the alliance of Baekje and Silla strengthened its ties by serving each other in terms of battlefields with Goguryeo. Baekje with its continuous efforts underKing Muryeong tried to attack its northern boundary with Goguryeo, notably in 505, mobilizing more than 3,000 soldiers. Korean records also mentions the provocative actions of Baekje several times, which called upon the counterattack of Munjamyeong in 506 but it failed without distinct fruits because of harsh famines. Buddhism in Goguryeo gained its continuous momentum after its acceptance into the kingdom during the reign of Sosurim. As his grandfathers did, Munja also boosted the expansion and distribution of Buddhism, especially via Liang and Wei. Under his reign, it is said nine monks were firstly sent to Northern Wei with a view to investigating Buddhist books and others. In 7th year (498), he constructed the Buddhist temple Geumgangsa. Munjamyeong was succeeded by his eldest son Anjang of Goguryeo.

In the context of a Cultural Heritage Survey, the City of Oakland officially named most of the blocks of the neighborhood \\"The Lakeside Apartments District,\\" and designated it as a local historic district with architecturally significant historic places, and Areas of Primary Importance (APIs). The greater neighborhood includes the interior blocks officially designated as a local historic district and the 'Gold Coast' peripheral areas along Lakeside Drive, 20th Street, and the west edge of Lake Merritt, areas closer to 14th Street and the Civic Center district, and blocks adjacent to downtown along Harrison Street. The district is characterized by a predominance of rent-stabilized apartments, mixed-use buildings, and a long history of regional mass transit connections serving its central location. In recent years, mid-rise, mixed- use, market rate, and affordable rental housing has been planned, proposed, approved, constructed, and inhabited. At the present, other developers have proposed market-rate condominium skyscrapers and other high-rise towers which have idled in various stages of the planning process. From 2007 to 2009, the Oakland Planning Commission revised zoning and building height regulations for the neighborhood. History The neighborhood was built on what was originally an encinal or Coast Live Oak oak grove on the west shore of the San Antonio Slough, which was later dammed to form Lake Merritt. Prior to the California Mission era, locations around the Slough were fishing and waterfowl hunting grounds for the Ohlone. Later in the Mission era, under the proclaimed authority of his Crown, King Ferdinand VII of Spain deeded the land to Sergeant Luis Maria Peralta in 1820 to become his Rancho San Antonio. After gold was discovered in 1848 in present-day Coloma to the northeast, Anglo squatters led by lawyer Horace W. Carpentier took control of the East Bay area which was to become downtown Oakland, including land along the San Antonio Slough.Northlakegroup.org - northlake group Resources and Information. This website is for sale! Before Oakland was even incorporated by the State legislature, by 1850, a trio of three ambitious men, to include Carpentier, had leased land from one of Luis' sons, Vincente Peralta. They hired a Swiss engineer, Julius Kellsburger, to prepare a street grid map. They began selling lots, whether through a good faith belief that US sovereignty superseded Mexican claims, or through deliberate fraud perpetrated on Peralta. The street grid of Kellsburger's map starts at the Oakland Estuary waterfront, and ends at 14th street, the neighborhood's Southeast boundary. The current streets of the neighborhood show up on E.M. Sessions' 1869 map of Oakland, with long sweeping blocks north of 14th Street. That same year, the western terminus of the transcontinental railroad at Seventh and Broadway brought passengers from New York that had been confined to a train for a week, eager for the comforts and amenities of a city. By this time, horse-drawn streetcars brought passengers up Broadway to 14th Street and points beyond. By the 1890s, the neighborhood had become home to large homes on the lake and interior streets. By the 1920s, apartment buildings and luxury hotels began to sprout up within walking distance from nearby streetcar lines, and Downtown Oakland. In the 1960s and 1970s, the neighborhood saw continued development of multi-family, mixed-use apartment buildings with the planning and construction of nearby Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) underground rail lines. Starting in 1961, Oakland's \\"Downtown Property Owner's Association,\\" and the \\"Central Business District Association\\" repeatedly advocated for extending Alice Street directly through Snow Park, which was then the grounds of the Snow Museum, past the Schilling Gardens and the Bechtel Building, and down to 20th Street to alleviate traffic congestion that might be caused by the closure of Broadway during construction of the nearby BART line underneath Broadway. The plan met stiff opposition from Oakland's City Council in October 1964, and caused then Mayor Houlihan to remark that \\"One of the things which has bothered me about Oakland is the presence of these small time feuds. The city could be better advanced by using their (downtown businessman's) energies in more progressive ways.\\" As reported by the Staff of the Oakland Tribune at the time, the City Council in essence told downtown business interests to \\"quit wasting its time.\\" In the early 21st century, the area continues to be attractive to developers as AC Transit's bus rapid transit lines are currently being planned for 12th and 11th Streets in the neighboring Civic Center district, and on Broadway downtown. Historic places and landmarks The district has an outstanding concentration of club buildings, historic luxury apartments, and a significant cluster of Deco structures, including the terra cotta Charles Jurgens Co. building, the Elks Hall on Alice Street (now the Malonga Casquelord Arts Center), the Hill Castle Apartments on Jackson Street, The Hotel Harrison on Harrison Street, the Scottish Rite Center at the lake's edge on Lakeside Drive, the Alameda County Courthouse in the neighboring Civic Center district, which also features the Civic Center Post Office on 13th Street. The \\"Ideal Cleaners\\" shop features a neon sign and period appointments in the Art Deco style. Many of these historic buildings are protected as official city landmarks. During a city Cultural Heritage Survey in the 1980s most of the district was designated as featuring historically significant architectural resources. The Survey was conducted by the city of Oakland's Planning Department and its Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board from 1980 to 1985. Other historic places include the Victorian Camron-Stanford house on the shore of Lake Merritt at 14th Street and Lakeside Drive, the Municipal Boathouse on Lakeside Drive, the Greek revival Scottish Rite Center on Lakeside Drive, the eleven story Bechtel Building at 244 Lakeside, the Alician apartments on Alice Street with its ornate marble entrance, the Regillus condominiums on 19th street, the mission revival Scottish Rite Temple on Madison Street, and the historic Schilling Gardens on 19th Street. One of the least likely structures to be overlooked‚Äîeasily visible from a few blocks south of the neighborhood looking up Madison Street, is Tudor Hall. Its distinct architecture resembles the namesake period of the late 15th-early 17th centuries. The district also features other historic assets in several three to eight story apartment buildings, this height being a character-defining feature of most of the historic district. Some exceptions to this character punctuate the neighborhood, to include Noble Tower on Lakeside Drive, and the Essex Condominiums at 17th and Lakeside, completed in 2001. Parks and community assets Lakeside park The district is adjacent to Lakeside Park, which lies to the east and northeast of the district. Lakeside Park is a public city park ring and green space surrounding Lake Merritt and is often called the Crown Jewel of Oakland's parks. Lakeside park is historically significant as featuring North America's first official wildlife refuge, designated in 1870. The state legislature voted the Lake Merritt Wildlife Refuge into law in 1870, making it the first such refuge on the North American continent. No hunting of any sort was to be allowed and the only fishing was to be by hook and line. Under the name Lake Merritt Wild Duck Refuge, the site became a National Historic Landmark on May 23, 1963. It also features a garden center with several cultivated gardens, and the Municipal Boat House on Lakeside Drive. A large restaurant has opened in the Boat House building, which has undergone extensive renovations, and was re-dedicated by city staff in 2009 in anticipation of its re-opening. Malonga Casquelourd Center for the Arts The neighborhood also features the Malonga Casquelourd Center for the Arts on Alice Street, a public community asset owned and administered by the City of Oakland and its Department of Parks and Recreation. Formerly known as the Alice Arts Center, this building was renamed in 2004 in honor of Malonga Casquelourd, a Congolese dancer, choreographer, singer, percussionist, and cultural ambassador of the arts who was killed in 2003 by a drunk driver traveling in the wrong direction on a blind curve on Lakeside Drive in front of the Essex condominium building. The Alice Arts Center was opened in 1987 under then-Mayor Lionel Wilson. It has a 400-seat theater and fine arts and dance studios where numerous dancers, percussionists, and other musicians study and create music and visual arts. It has become a vibrant center for dance and music, particularly African- and African-American-influenced dance forms from Congolese, Guinean and Afro-Brazilian to jazz and hip-hop. City officials estimate that the center serves 50,000 people a year through classes and performances. The Oakland Ballet has had offices and rehearsals at the center. The building also features 74 S.R.O. hotel rooms where artists in residence reside. In 2003, then-Mayor Jerry Brown proposed expanding his Oakland School for the Arts, which was at the time housed in the basement and first floor of the Alice Street building, to the entire six-floor center. Numerous hotel rooms were withheld and kept vacant while plans were made to displace the artist tenants from their S.R.O. hotel rooms and studios in the center. The building also features a prominent ground floor retail space adjacent to its main entrance. Over the years the space was the home to a cafe with poetry readings. From late 2003 until early 2007, the space was home to the \\"Jahva House\\" cafe, owned by Oakland musician Dwayne Wiggins of the music group Tony! Toni! Ton√©!. The cafe relocated there following its move from a Lakeshore Avenue space. The cafe featured Wednesday night poetry slams, a traditional African drum craftsman with a sidewalk workshop, and regular live music performances. At present Oakland's Real Estate Division is seeking a retail tenant for the space. Oakland main library The neighborhood is also walking distance to the Main Branch of the Oakland Public Library on 14th Street between Madison and Oak Street. Oakland Museum of California The Oakland Museum of California is located at 11th and Oak Streets in the neighboring Civic Center district. Snow Park The district is also adjacent to Oakland's Snow Park a , Snow Park, City Of Oakland, Office of Parks and Recreation public city park bordered by 19th Street, the Schilling Gardens Parcel, Harrison Street and Lakeside Drive. Snow Park, which is named after Oakland resident Henry Snow, was once the site of the first Oakland Zoo, the Sidney Snow Zoo, named after Henry Snow's son, which opened in 1943.\\"Historic Dates,\\"City Of Oakland, Office of Parks and Recreation It currently features public restroom facilities, sitting benches, mature shade trees, a grassy, sunlit meadow, and a golf putting green, which many neighborhood and citywide residents, and nearby office workers enjoy. Schools and colleges Residents of the neighborhood are zoned to schools in the Oakland Unified School District. Zoned schools include Lincoln Elementary School (K-5), which is the local public elementary school.Lincoln Elementary School website Westlake Middle School, and Oakland Technical High School are the respective intermediate and secondary schools. Laney College is a public community college located at the south end of the Civic Center neighborhood. Cal State East Bay has the Oakland Professional Development and Conference Center at Broadway and 11th Street. Continuing education courses are offered. Land development The neighborhood is located between Lake Merritt and Downtown Oakland. In recent years, market-rate housing developers have proposed constructing a variety of residential and residential mixed-use buildings which have been proposed to be anywhere from five to forty-two stories high. Neighborhood residents have voiced their concerns and objections to various proposed developments. Others have pressed developers to include meaningful community benefits to improve proposed projects at \\"community meetings,\\" and before Oakland's Preliminary Design Review Committee, the City's Planning Commission and City Council. In recent years Oakland city planning authorities have approved proposed residential mixed use development projects in this neighborhood in part because they are considered by some to be \\"infill\\". In other words, they are \\"filling in\\" under-utilized \\"vacant\\" lots in an urbanized setting. Most all such lots have had daily commercial use such as surface parking for the neighborhood's drive-in workforce by day, and for some of the neighborhood's automobile driving residents and drive-in bar and restaurant patrons by night. One such vacant lot on 14th Street at Madison, directly adjacent to the boundaries of the neighborhood, is used as a preschool playground for several neighborhood children who attend the school, as it is within walking distance for their 'car-free' parents. A developer recently proposed a project for this particular lot which has been tentatively titled \\"1301 Madison\\". Some developers purport that projects proposed for the district's parcels, developed and undeveloped, are substantially exempted from the environmental review provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act(CEQA) because they are considered \\"infill\\" parcels. In other words, CEQA has a special provision for streamlined environmental review for infill projects located in urban areas of Oakland. Conversely, some activists have pointed to the applicability of the \\"Cumulative Impact\\" provisions of CEQA arguing that the residents of the neighborhood have already been subjected to several consecutive years of construction, dust, pile-driving and general construction noise, and carcinogenic diesel fumes from idling trucks and heavy equipment. Mid-rise, mixed-use apartment buildings An unfinished building languished in the neighborhood from 2003 to 2009. Originally planned as \\"Jackson Courtyard Condominiums,\\" the mixed-use building at 1401 Jackson Street features transit oriented development characteristics such as ground- floor retail shop spaces and a dedicated bicycle parking room at street level. For several years, the incomplete project sat partially finished, shrink- wrapped in white plastic sheeting, reminiscent of a condom, hence its local nickname: \\"Trojan Tower.\\" In September 2008, the shrink-wrap was removed for the second time from the building. In the summer of 2009, after years of extensive reconstruction work, the building finally received its certificate of occupancy and has been replanned for monthly rental apartments. Its first residents began moving into the building in August 2009, a full six years after the original developer of the project broke ground. In 2008, \\"Affordable Housing Associates\\", a Berkeley, California non-profit completed a seven- story, 76-unit apartment building which has been funded in part with affordable housing entitlement funds and pre-development loans from the California Department of Housing and Community Development and the City of Oakland. It includes studio and one-, two- and three-bedroom units that feature a combination of traditional floor plans as well as two-story lofts with flexible layouts. The building features transit-oriented development characteristics to include multiple ground floor retail shop spaces, a transit information kiosk, and 54 parking spaces for 73 units, a ratio of .74 parking spaces per unit, which departs from Oakland's current 'one to one' parking ratio planning law. This project came under intense scrutiny from neighborhood activists for its architectural design which contrasts with the character of a mosque next door to the project, the Islamic Cultural Center of Northern California, a historic mission-revival building that was originally the Scottish Rite masonic temple. Proposed condominium skyscrapers (a.k.a. \\"222 19th Street\\"/\\"19th Street Residential Condominiums Project\\") In 2005, a group of land speculators purchased a historic 1920s luxury apartment building at 244 Lakeside Drive on Lake Merritt. The Greenfield land behind the building features the historic Schilling Gardens. The Shilling Gardens is the last remaining portion of a cultivated Japanese garden originally planted in 1886 behind spice magnate August Schilling's Victorian mansion once located on the West shore of Lake Merritt. Today the garden features a shaded grove of several mature Coast Redwood trees, ferns, a sunny lawn area, and hundreds of other cultivated plants laid out into a multi-tiered, brick masonry landscape design, with artistic concrete floral canopy arbors and walking paths. The garden as a whole is considered by the City of Oakland's Register of Historical Resources, and Oakland's Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, to be a landmark \\"of highest importance.\\" After purchasing the parcel, the owners divided the parcel into two pieces, one along Lakeside Drive featuring the apartment building, and another parcel behind the building featuring the gardens. The owners then sought to donate the gardens parcel to the City of Oakland in exchange for Historic Preservation property tax credits. Oakland's Real Estate Services Division and Office of Parks and Recreation Staff entered into discussions with the owners. City staff asserted the parcel would need disability accessibility improvements as per the ADA and its own dedicated bathroom facilities, despite bathroom facilities immediately next door at Snow Park. The city staff also insisted the owners pay $760,000 for the aforementioned upgrades, and an additional $178,000 per year, in perpetuity, for ongoing maintenance. Subsequently, the negotiations fell apart and Oakland's office of Parks and Recreation Director said she didn't bring the decision before the Oakland City Council because she thought that the department dealing with the owner, Oakland's CEDA Real Estate Services Division, was doing that. The director of Oakland Community and Economic Development Agency, Real Estate Services Division denied any responsibility for the missed opportunity. He said he was presented with \\"budget restraints\\" and that, in any case, his role was limited to providing \\"real estate-related expertise.\\". In 2006, the owners, two Santa Clara County residents, and a former San Francisco Building Inspection Commissioner, and pari mutuel racehorse owner, proposed a 42-story high-rise condominium skyscraper for the historic Schilling Gardens parcel. They have tentatively labeled the project \\"Emerald Views\\" though the official planning documents on file with the city of Oakland refer to the project as \\"222 19th Street.\\" This parcel is approximately one half block from the lake's current shoreline, at 222 19th Street between Jackson and Alice Streets. Standing at approximately tall measured from grade to the top of roof spires., the Emerald Views skyscraper would become the tallest building in Oakland If constructed, the project's architect concedes that \\"the entire site has to be dug up\\" and the trees completely destroyed, to construct the new tower, due to its size and extent However, the architect claims the developers intend to replant some of the existing shrubs, plants, and ferns in a new garden area that will abut the sides and back of their proposed building. While any project on the parcel could diminish the neighborhood's tree canopy, the proposed skyscraper's height and bulk could cast a shadow over a significant portion of Lakeside Park in the afternoons, and the remaining areas of Snow Park that currently receive easterly sunlight every morning, since trees currently shade much of Snow Park.Snow Park, City of Oakland, Office of Parks and Recreation Because of its height, the building would also be anticipated to cast a long shadow over Lake Merritt, Lakeside Park, and the bird sanctuary within Lakeside Park to the east of the parcel. To date the developers have only publicly circulated a sunlight and shadow impact rendering for high noon on the summer solstice, the time of the year with the most sun and the least shadow. The other sunlight and shadow study renderings will be published in the project's upcoming draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) which may also include hydro- geological issues, air and noise pollution, among other potential environmental impacts. Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown previously owned a 20 percent stake in the Schilling Gardens parcel, but sold out his share to the other owners in 2006 and maintains that he fears that an adjacent high-rise will hurt the value of the building he bought into. Speaking about the project to investigative reporter Phil Matier, Brown claimed in 2006 that \\"I ain't in that deal.\\" Since 2006, the owners have assembled a real estate development team led by San Francisco resident Michael Joseph O'Donoghue, more commonly known as Joe O'Donoghue, who is credited with dramatically changing the landscape across the bay in San Francisco through his long history of a variety of lobbying activity for development projects on behalf of the San Francisco Residential Builders Association (RBA). The parcel owners have also retained the services of Oakland's \\"Go-To-Lobbyist\\" who resigned from his job as a legislative aide to the current Oakland City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente during a time of controversy over conflicts on interest on zoning matters affecting his personal real property portfolio. This former legislative aide's corporation, \\"Terra Linda Development Services,\\" is an Oakland-based consulting firm which labels itself as \\"a land development and entitlement consulting company.\\" In late 2007, the aforementioned \\"go to\\" lobbyist was involved in the founding of the \\"Oakland Builder's Alliance\\" which purports to achieve its goals \\"through the promotion and development of innovative policies, through supporting leaders that promote economic growth in Oakland, and through direct organizing in support of leaders and policies that address the needs of our members and the broad building community of Oakland.\\" On August 8, 2008, the Oakland CEDA Planning and Zoning Division posted Tree Removal Permit Application notices on the gates to the parcel. The gardens feature a grove of several mature Coast Redwood trees that would be completely destroyed by the buildings bulk and mass. This tree removal application is a 'Development Application' regulated by the City of Oakland, and subject to City Council oversight and appeal. In early 2007, a developer, proposed the construction of a 37-story market-rate condominium skyscraper at 1439 Alice Street, directly across the street from the Malonga Casquelourd Center for the Arts, and adjacent to the three story 1920s Cliff Apartments. The building would be one of the tallest in Oakland, second only to the Ordway Building in the neighboring Downtown district. The building would be built on a parcel that currently features a combined two story parking garage and retail shop space with an active, longtime retail tenant. The project would maintain the current parking garage facade, with its existing design for the first two levels, with a modern, angular glass tower springing out of the top, and rising to a height of . Though the developer did propose a ground floor wine bar/cold food cafe space for a small portion of the first floor, he proposed an overall reduction in the square footage of the existing ground floor retail space and a substantial square footage for the proposed building resident lobby, and elimination of a current first floor exterior retail space entrance. The developer also proposed a mid-building \\"wellness center\\"/\\"personal services\\" commercial space. Depending upon a final zoning designation and the planning process however, this commercial space could also be used as medical or professional office or an inclusive, approachable space with a neighborhood-serving retail tenant. Supporters of the Arts Center had concerns that those would move into the building could eventually have a reverse sensitivity to the music and drumming across the street. Political representation Beaux Arts-style entrance to the Regillus apartment building The Hill-Castle Apartment Hotel The entire neighborhood lies within the boundaries of Oakland City Council District 3, represented by longtime West Oakland resident Nancy Nadel, who ran for Mayor of Oakland during the 2006 election, garnering 13% of the popular vote in a three-way race with candidates Ignacio Delafuente and former mayor Ron Dellums. In the 2008 District 3 City Council election, West Oakland residents Greg Hodge and Sean Sullivan challenged Nadel for the District 3 seat to which she was re-elected for her fourth consecutive term with 51% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a run- off election. At the county level, the neighborhood lies within Alameda County Board of Supervisors District 5 and is represented by Supervisor Keith Carson. At the state level, the neighborhood is in , and . At the federal level, the neighborhood is in . Retail A neighborhood sidewalk cafe on 17th Street Most neighborhood restaurants, shops, and services are locally owned and independently operated and enjoy a good business relationship with neighborhood residents who walk to them. Immediately within the neighborhood are small ground floor retail shop spaces which currently feature six grocery and liquor markets, two laundry and dry-cleaner shops, a fabric shop, a tattoo parlor, a gym, a sidewalk cafe one block from Lake Merritt open into the evenings, a pet shop, a diner, a sandwich shop, and two bars. In the fall of 2008, several new ground floor retail shop spaces will be available for lease at two new mixed-use developments on 14th Street in the neighborhood. Transportation Mass transit legacy In 1871, Oakland's first horse- drawn streetcar line running down Broadway was not three years old when Hiram Tubbs opened his luxurious \\"Tubbs Hotel\\" at Fifth Avenue in what was then \\"Brooklyn,\\" an independent municipality on the east side of the tidal slough which is now lake Merritt. Tubbs, flush with cash from his hemp cordage business and Comstock Lode silver bullion, wanted his hotel to be the on par with the finest in the state. He spared no expense, investing US$110,000 in 1871 dollars for the building and over US$100,000 more on furniture for the rooms. Hoping to lure passengers from overland trains, Tubbs had rail laid at his own expense, for his own horse-drawn streetcar line, the \\"Tubbs Line,\\" to carry passengers from the Train Depot at 7th and Broadway eastward to his hotel. The line went up Broadway to 12th Street, and then down 12th Street through what is now the Civic Center neighborhood, out to 13th Avenue. Tubbs' choice of track routing later evolved into the Oakland Brooklyn and Fruitvale Railroad, and eventually, the \\"A line\\" of the Key System of electric streetcars which later ran down 12th and 13th Streets. Today, the 12th Street corridor serves articulated AC Transit buses and is currently being planned for a bus rapid transit line. In the 1960s, on the Broadway corridor, the BART system was planned and constructed, opening for service in 1972 at three stations, each approximately 1/3 mile from the neighborhood. Rapid transit A Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train departs the nearby Lake Merritt station at 9th and Oak Streets Many residents in this neighborhood do not own or drive cars and walk to transit connections such as the Oakland City Center/12th Street, 19th Street, and Lake Merritt BART stations. Within the neighborhood, AC Transit's 26 line carries passengers to and from the neighborhood along 14th Street, routing directly to nearby BART stations. AC Transit's Uptown Regional Transit Center bus mall on nearby Thomas L. Berkeley Way (20th Street) is now in full farebox service, and features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, local and Rapid Bus service to Oakland's streetcar suburbs. These stations host local service, Rapid service, Transbay Express, and All Nighter service. A Translink Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit Headquarters on Franklin Street. The number 1 line running along the neighborhood on 12th Street, between San Leandro and Berkeley, is years into the planning process for the implementation of a full scale bus rapid transit line. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature double-articulated buses with five to six doors at boarding platform level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms with proof-of-payment ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in their favor. Bicycle and pedestrian Facilities Other residents use bicycle infrastructure in the area such as the neighborhood's class three Arterial Bike Route: 14th Street, 'BikeLink' bicycle lockers at the nearby 12th Street /City Center, 19th Street, and Lake Merritt BART Stations, and numerous city-installed bike racks to which they can lock their bikes. A Bicycle Rental business rents bikes by the hour nearby on the East side of Downtown. Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan, and Oakland's Measure DD park improvement plan for Lake Merritt calls for an automobile lane reduction and re-striping of bike lanes onto two of the district's streets: Lakeside Drive and Madison Street, and on nearby Webster and Franklin Streets, North of 14th Street. The plan also calls for the installation of a separated class one bikeway and multi-use trail immediately around the perimeter of Lake Merritt, and class two bicycle lanes on all arterial streets surrounding the lake, such as Grand Avenue, between Harrison and Macarthur, where a bike lane already exists, and on Lakeshore Boulevard, onto which a bicycle lane has been planned and contracted to be striped. Taxicabs and carsharing An officially zoned taxicab stand is located at the Northeast corner of 19th and Harrison Streets, next to Snow Park. Automobile taxis are available, and a local bicycle pedicab service is on-call during daytime and early evening hours. A locally based car sharing service, City CarShare, has a shared car and shared truck at 14th and Jackson, and one car at the Lakehurst Apartment Hotel at 17th and Jackson. An hourly carsharing provider, Zipcar, has three locations in the neighborhood, two cars at 15th and Jackson, and one at 15th and Harrison. A former Zipcar location at 17th and Harrison was removed in early 2008 for environmental scoping on that corner parcel, which has recently been repaved and re-striped for the resumption of parking lot operations. Nonetheless, the lot is currently fenced in anticipation of proposed development on the parcel. Private vehicle storage Due to high demand for parking within the neighborhood, both from a density of residents and from numerous nearby parking \\"attractors,\\" parts of the streets of the neighborhood have been zoned into Oakland's Area-F Residential Permit Parking (RPP) zone which includes most streets in the neighborhood. This program allows for annual fee-based issuance of one sticker per residence or business from the Parking Enforcement Division of Oakland's Finance and Management Agency. The sticker allows those permit-holders who can find a safe space in the public right-of-way to store a car for three days with exemption from the posted parking restrictions, which are two hours in most areas, reducing cold starts and resulting vehicle emissions. Violent crime Up until the 2000s, the neighborhood had a reputation among some in the Right-wing-leaning segments of the Oakland Blogosphere in recent years as being a \\"dangerous area.\\" But crime and census statistics published by Oakland police and government circa 2017‚Äì2020 indicate a lowering of violent crime correlated to Oakland's sustained economic revival, hypergentrification in general, and the influx of affluent residents to the district in particular. https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/11/new-oakland-apartments-push-rents- higher-than-other-bay-area-cities/ https://www.trulia.com/n/ca/oakland/lakeside/88037/ https://www.ktvu.com/news/oakland-murders-dip-to-lowest-level-in-19-years-not- everyone-impressed Nonetheless, property crimes and acts of violence occur periodically, directly within the interior of the neighborhood. The neighborhood lies completely within Oakland's Police Beat 4x, one of 35 across the city. Eleven years ago, in 2009, violent crimes, as reported by the Oakland Police Department, included five burglaries, twelve robberies, and multiple assaults during the summer of 2009. Oscar Grant murder riots In the days following BART Police Officer Johannes Mehserle's shooting of Oscar Grant on New Year's Morning 2009, and the ensuing reaction by the Alameda County District Attorney's office, justice activists and community members organized response actions and demonstrations. On January 7, about 200 people marched in protest into Oakland's Central Business District. Some became violent and began rioting. Police lines pushed the rioting east from Downtown along 14th Street and into the neighborhood, where rioters continued rioting on Jackson Street and Madison Street. After helicopter-mounted television cameras broadcast images of rioters smashing the windows at a McDonald's restaurant at 14th and Jackson, the rioting briefly wound down after Mayor Ron Dellums and other Oakland leaders came out to the scene to plead with the crowd for calm. Rioters caused over $200,000 in damage while breaking shop and car windows, burning several cars, to include one on Madison Street, setting trash bins on fire, and throwing bottles at police officers. Police arrested over 100.

It spent two weeks on the UK albums chart peaking at #65. The album is based upon the adventures of Elric of Melnibon√©, a recurring character in the novels of science fiction author Michael Moorcock, a long-standing associate of the group, who contributes lyrics to one track on the album. Background After two years of constant line-up changes, guitarist Dave Brock (the only member who has remained since the band's formation) settled on a line-up of himself, guitarist Huw Lloyd- Langton, keyboardist Harvey Bainbridge, bassist Alan Davey, and drummer Danny Thompson (son of Pentangle's bassist Danny Thompson). Though the album is largely inspired by Elric, \\"Needle Gun\\" is a reference to Jerry Cornelius, another of Moorcock's fictional characters. In keeping with the album's title, the track's inclusion refers to the wider Multiverse created by Moorcock, in which the characters Elric of Melnibon√© and Jerry Cornelius are both incarnations of The Eternal Champion, and the Needle Gun is the form in which the Black Sword manifests itself to Cornelius. The lyrics for \\"Needle Gun\\" were ghostwritten by Roger Neville-Neil. The outer cover was designed by John Coulthart, the last work he would do for the group, and the inner by Bob Walker. The album was originally intended to be titled after the name of the sword Stormbringer, but was changed due to it having been used by both Deep Purple and John Martyn and Beverley Martyn. Prior to the recording of the album, the group appeared on Channel 4's ECT on 26 April and recorded a session for BBC Radio 1 on 19 July. They headlined an anti-heroin festival at Crystal Palace on 24 August, with a guest appearance from Lemmy. The group undertook a 29 date UK tour in November and December to promote the album, with support from Dumpy's Rusty Nuts. The Hammersmith Odeon shows on 3 and 4 December were filmed and recorded, released as the video The Chronicle of the Black Sword and album Live Chronicles, and featured a guest appearance from Moorcock. It has been issued on CD multiple times, each with differing bonus tracks. The latest issue in 2009 includes 1984's The Earth Ritual Preview EP.

Pyeongwon was also known as 'Pyeonggangsanghowang'. His birth name was Yangseong (though the Suishu and Tangshu have him as Tangseong). Reign The years of Pyeongwon's rule are generally agreed upon by historians, but his year of birth has not been established with any degree of certainty. It is known that he was the eldest son of Yangwon of Goguryeo and became crown prince in 557, two years before assuming full power. He is said to have been courageous, and skilled in horseriding and archery. By this time, royal power had been significantly eroded by the aristocracy. Concerned for the people, he encouraged agricultural and sericultural developments and reduced the royal cuisine. He maintained tense but relatively peaceful relations with the G√∂kt√ºrks and the various Chinese dynasties, briefly battling the Northern Zhou at the Liaodong Peninsula in 577. He frequently sent tributes to the Chen Dynasty, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou and Sui Dynasty. As the Sui Dynasty united China, King Pyeongwon prepared for the impending war. The southern border with the other two Korean kingdoms was relatively peaceful as the Silla-Baekje alliance fell apart. In 586, he moved the capital to Jangan fortress. In 590, the king received news that the state of Chen had fallen and was greatly alarmed. For defense purposes he ordered troops into training and the augmentation of military provisions. The rule of Pyeongwon came to an end in 590, which is the year of his death according to Samguk Sagi, but there is no specific documentation to confirm the circumstances. He was given the posthumous royal title of King Pyeongwon. Popular culture * Portrayed by Lee Yong-jik in the 2017 Netflix TV series My Only Love Song.

The Hello Kitty Murder was a 1999 case in which a nightclub hostess was kidnapped and tortured in an apartment in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, after stealing a wallet. She was kidnapped and tortured by three men before dying a month later. She was then decapitated and her head was placed inside of a Hello Kitty doll. It happened on 17 March that year. Case A 23-year-old night club hostess by the name of Fan Man-yee (Ê®äÊïèÂÑÄ) was kidnapped by three men: 34-year-old Chan Man-lok (Èô≥ÊñáÊ®Ç), 27-year-old Leung Shing-cho (Ê¢ÅÂãùÁ•ñ), 21-year-old Leung Wai-lun (Ê¢ÅÂÅâÂÄ´), and Chan Man-lok's 13-year-old girlfriend after allegedly stealing a wallet from one of them. They took her to an apartment at No. 31 Granville Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, where they imprisoned her. They beat and tortured her daily over a debt dispute of HK$20,000 (US$2,560). After a month of imprisonment and torture, Fan was killed (or died as a result of injuries) and dismembered. Her captors placed her skull inside of a Hello Kitty mermaid doll and discarded the rest of her remains. Only Fan's skull, one tooth, and some internal organs were recovered. Fan's remains were found only after Chan's girlfriend led police to the scene. Court case The three men were convicted of manslaughter as the jury ruled the remains were not sufficient to show whether Fan was murdered or died in another way, such as a drug overdose. The underage girlfriend of one of the men testified at the trial in exchange for immunity. The trio were convicted of manslaughter by a jury after a six- week trial. Justice Peter Nguyen, who sentenced the trio to life in prison, stated, \\"Never in Hong Kong in recent years has a court heard of such cruelty, depravity, callousness, brutality, violence and viciousness.\\" Psychiatric reports described the three, members of a secret triad society, as \\"remorseless\\". The jury could not rule that the men intended to kill 23-year- old Fan Man-yee, which would have meant a mandatory life sentence, but it was determined she died as a result of their abuse. There will be no review for parole for 20 years, i.e. until 2019. Aftermath The publicity around the case resulted in the production and release of films that told the story. Both Human Pork Chop (ÁÉπÂ±ç‰πãÂñ™Áõ°Â§©ËâØ) and There is a Secret in my Soup were released in 2001. The apartment building in which the crime took place was demolished in September 2012 and has been rebuilt as a hotel in 2016.

They are shrubs, sometimes small trees and usually have small, crowded, rather aromatic leaves. The flowers are similar to those of plants in the genus Leptospermum but differ in having stamens that are longer than the petals. Most kunzeas are endemic to Western Australia but a few occur in eastern Australia and a few are found in New Zealand. The taxonomy of the genus is not settled and is complicated by the existence of a number of hybrids. Description Plants in the genus Kunzea are shrubs or small trees, usually with their leaves arranged alternately along the branches. The flowers are arranged in clusters near the ends of the branches, which in some species, continue to grow after flowering. The flowers of most species lack a stalk but those that have one are usually solitary or in groups of two or three. In some species, the flowers are surrounded by enlarged bracts. There are five petals, five sepals and a large number of stamens which are always longer than the petals. The fruit is a usually a woody capsule. Kunzeas are similar to species in other genera of the Myrtaceae, especially Leptospermum but are distinguished from that genus by having stamens that are longer than the petals.Kunzea phylicoides foliage and fruit Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of a kunzea was published in 1828 by Ludwig Reichenbach in his book Conspectus Regni Vegetabilis. Reichenbach referred to three species - K. capitata, K. ericifolia and K. corifolia (now K. ambigua but did not nominate a type species. In 1981, Hellmut Toelken nominated K. capitata as the type species. Reichenbach named the genus after his \\"distinguished friend\\", the German naturalist Gustav Kunze, professor of botany in Leipzig. The taxonomy of the genus is not settled and hybrids often occur where two species occur in the same area. Distribution The majority of Kunzea species are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia but there are species in every Australian state and in New Zealand. Use in horticulture Some species of Kunzea are suitable for use in gardens. Kunzea ambigua is described as a \\"handsome shrub which attracts numerous birds and colourful soldier beetles when in flower\\". A form of this species from southern Victoria reputedly flowers profusely with sprays of scented flowers. Kunzea capitata and K. pulchella are red-flowering species from Western Australia and are described as \\"indeed outstanding\\" although they are sometimes difficult to establish in eastern states and need to be grafted onto hardier rootstock.

Vijayaraghavan pioneered active research in the areas of metal physics, magnetic resonance in biophysical systems, and fine particle physics, a forerunner to nanoscience. He is a fellow of several science academies and twice elected as a member of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics commission on magnetism.  Early life  He was born in a well-off family. He was the grandson of Mahawidwan R. Raghava Iyengar, a renowned Tamil and Sanskrit scholar of the 20th century.  Career  After graduating from the Annamalai University in 1951, he joined the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) at Bombay as a Research Student, eventually rising to the position of Distinguished Professor and Dean (Physics Faculty). He formally retired in 1996 . He was deputed twice by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna, Austria, as an Expert to set up the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory at the Atomic Energy Centre, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. He was awarded an Indian National Science Academy Senior Scientist position from 1996 to 2001, during which he worked at SAMEER, Mumbai, in collaboration with TIFR. In the 1950s, he constructed a crossed circle wide line NMR spectrometer which could detect deuterium and oxygen-17 isotopes in their natural abundance. Using oxygen-17 as a probe, he demonstrated chemical shifts in organic liquids due to electronic bonding. He subsequently developed an interdisciplinary group which used NMR and susceptibility measurements in metals to show that susceptibility and the hyperfine field at the nucleus were related and could be modified by alloying. The oscillatory nature of the conduction electron polarisation was established in rare earth alloys. The findings from experiments performed in bulk samples of transition metals, rare earths, Heusler alloys and spin glass were related to results obtained from microscopic techniques such as NMR, Mossbauer and neutron diffraction. In 1986, his group organized one of the first international conferences on high Tc superconductors. He and his collaborators, are credited with the discovery of superconductivity in borocarbides with magnetic elements (under the leadership of R. Nagarajan and L. C. Gupta) and new valence fluctuating materials, heavy fermions, rare earth magnetism phenomena and highly correlated electron systems. His group also made early contributions to the detection of tumors by magnetic resonance. As a tribute to his contribution to physics, two felicitation volumes were published in 1991 on the occasion of his 60th birthday: Frontiers in solid state series, Superconductivity (Vol.1), and Magnetism (Vol. 2), by World Scientific Publishing, in Singapore. These volumes incorporate articles written by leading international scientists, including Nobel laureates. Vijayaraghavan was conferred the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 1976, and received the UGC Raman award in Physical Sciences in 1983. Apart from science, he is well versed in Hindu philosophy and Tamil literature.

It was his reply to Desiderius Erasmus' De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio or On Free Will, which had appeared in September 1524 as Erasmus' first public attack on Luther. At issue was whether human beings, after the Fall of Man, are free to choose good or evil. The debate between Luther and Erasmus is one of the earliest of the Reformation over the issue of free will and predestination.  Arguments of Erasmus  Despite his own criticisms of contemporary Roman Catholicism, Erasmus argued that it needed reformation from within and that Luther had gone too far. He held that all humans possessed free will and that the doctrine of predestination conflicted with the teachings of the Bible. Erasmus argued against the belief that God's foreknowledge of events caused those events, and he held that the doctrines of repentance, baptism and conversion depended on the existence of free will. He likewise contended that divine grace merely assisted humans in coming to the knowledge of God by supporting them as they used their free will to make choices between good and evil, which in turn could lead to salvation through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Content of Luther's response Luther's response was to reason that sin incapacitates human beings from working out their own salvation, and that they are completely incapable of bringing themselves to God. As such, there is no free will for humanity because any will they might have is overwhelmed by the influence of sin. Central to his analysis, both of the doctrines under discussion and of Erasmus' specific arguments, are Luther's beliefs concerning the power and complete sovereignty of God. Luther concluded that unredeemed human beings are dominated by obstructions; Satan, as the prince of the mortal world, never lets go of what he considers his own unless he is overpowered by a stronger power, i.e. God. When God redeems a person, he redeems the entire person, including the will, which then is liberated to serve God. No one can achieve salvation or redemption through their own willpower‚Äîpeople do not choose between good or evil, because they are naturally dominated by evil, and salvation is simply the product of God unilaterally changing a person's heart and turning them to good ends. Were it not so, Luther contended, God would not be omnipotent and omniscient and would lack total sovereignty over creation. He also held that arguing otherwise was insulting to the glory of God. As such, Luther concluded that Erasmus was not actually a Christian. Erasmus' rebuttal In early 1526, Erasmus replied to this work with the first part of his two-volume Hyperaspistes, but this was a long and complex work which did not gain much popular recognition. Luther's later views on his writings Luther was proud of his On the Bondage of the Will, so much so that in a letter to Wolfgang Capito written on 9 July 1537, he said: > Regarding [the plan] to collect my writings in volumes, I am quite cool and > not at all eager about it because, roused by a Saturnian hunger, I would > rather see them all devoured. For I acknowledge none of them to be really a > book of mine, except perhaps the one On the Bound Will and the Catechism.LW > 50:172-173. Luther compares himself to Saturn, a figure from Ancient Greek > mythology who devoured most of his children. Luther wanted to get rid of > many of his writings except for the two mentioned.

The flagship national organization for this field is the Conference on College Composition and Communication. In most US and some Canadian colleges and universities, undergraduate students take freshman or higher-level composition courses. To support the effective administration of these courses, the development of basic and applied research on the acquisition of writing skills, and an understanding of the history of the uses and transformation of writing systems and writing technologies (among many other subareas of research), over 70 American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition.Doctoral Consortium in Rhetoric and Composition These programs usually include study of composition pedagogical theory, research methodologies in rhetoric and composition, and the history of rhetoric. Many composition scholars study not only the theory and practice of post-secondary writing instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and genres on writers' composing processes.Genre Across Borders Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching English as a second or foreign language (TESOL) or second language writing, writing centers, and new literacies. Basic writing Many historians of Composition Studies argue that the matter of who exactly should be defined as a \\"basic writer\\" and what counts as ‚Äúbasic writing‚Äù is complex. The definition of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù has been disputed when framed around issues of writing proficiency in ‚ÄúStandard English,‚Äù increasingly racially/ethnically diverse college demographics, which both resulted from post-secondary desegregation mandates. For example, the term ‚Äúbasic writing‚Äù has been attributed to the SEEK program started by Mina P. Shaughnessy at the City University of New York, which she designed to help incoming college students from open admissions who had not historically been able to attend college. Consistent with then-current educational theories, many of these courses focused on what were at that time believed to be core concepts of formal English, like spelling, usage, and organization, though as the field has advanced these courses are increasingly aligned with the curricula found in mainstream first-year composition. Basic writing coursework has diversified considerably since its beginnings in non-credit-bearing 'pre' college courses, including stretch,Glau, Gregory R. (February 2010).

First-year composition Most US universities have a required first-year composition course, also referred to as FYC. Although both are typically housed in Departments of English, these courses are not the same as literature courses, which focus on literary analysis and interpretation. While some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses, it is much more often the case that composition coursework offers intensive instruction in writing non-fiction, expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies. Advanced composition Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs. Graduate studies Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at 94 universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities.Master's Degree Consortium of Writing Studies Specialists Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing & Rhetoric, Composition & Linguistics, etc.). Second-language writing Second language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. Paul Kei Matsuda in his article \\"Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context\\" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing.Matsuda, Paul K. \\"Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context.\\" Written Communication, Sage Publications, 1998, 15 (1), pp 99-121. Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties. The first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means \\"good\\" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. \\"Understanding Composing\\" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach.Perl, Sondra. \\"Understanding Composing\\" Handout, Composition Theories, University of Akron, 2016. She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to \\"backwards\\" parts of the process in order to move \\"forward\\" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article \\"Student Writing Errors in EFL,\\" points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar.Al-Buainain, Haifa. \\"Student Writing Errors in EFL.\\" Qatar University, 2006, pp 1 -37. Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing. Another approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article \\"Inventing the University\\".Bartholomae, David \\"Inventing the University,\\" Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp. 523- 555. He uses \\"Inventing the University\\" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style. Moreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article \\"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product\\", allows for wittier creating and freer movement.Murray, Donald M. \\"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product.\\" Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp 3-6. It suggests three elements for \\"good\\" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess \\"good\\" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach. ESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.  Multicultural pedagogies  = Basis in composition studies = While multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's \\"Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing\\" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students \\"need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively\\" (186). Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage \\"cross-cultural awareness\\" (191). In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in \\"Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture\\" describes how studies in \\"little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings\\" championed by scholars who \\"seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general,\\" which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403). Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for College English, \\"Service Learning and English Studies,\\" described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39). Furthermore, In Empowering Education, Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at \\"a low-budget college in New York City\\" several decades ago (10). The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in Empowering Education demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves \\"[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items‚Ä¶the educators selected some key concerns‚Äîgenerative themes expressed through generative words\\" (55). In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, \\"[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]‚Ä¶from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis\\" (56). Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural. Shor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world. In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists \\"subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them\\". = Critical reception = Overall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege \\"cross-cultural interactions\\" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric, Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more \\"global\\" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153). In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116). While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39). = Current approaches = Lazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism. For example, Lisa Eck's \\"Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally\\" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them‚Äîin the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions in her composition classroom. Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: \\"I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student‚Ä¶.I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar\\" (579). The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is both \\"not about you\\" and \\"about you,\\" and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse. Furthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, \\"Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach,\\" utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language. In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating \\"local topics,\\" Wilson provides options for students to \\"investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures\\" as well as \\"investigating\\" the relationships between language and power (8-9). Even more important, she insists that \\"[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways\\" (9). Writing across the curriculum Because academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic discourse communities.  The reading and apprenticeship connections  According to some writing theorists, reading for pleasure provides a more effective way of mastering the art of writing than does a formal study of writing, language, grammar, and vocabulary. > \\"Studies that sought to improve writing by providing reading experiences in > place of grammar study or additional writing practice found that these > experiences were as beneficial as, or more beneficial than, grammar study or > extra writing practice.\\" The apprenticeship approach provides one variant of the reading connection, arguing that the composition classroom should resemble pottery or piano workshops‚Äîminimizing dependence on excessive self-reflection, preoccupation with audience, and explicit rules. By watching the master, according to Michael Polanyi, an ‚Äúapprentice unconsciously picks up the rules of the art, including those which are not explicitly known to the master himself.‚Äù Writing instructors, according to this approach, serve as models and coaches, providing explicit feedback in response to the learner's compositions. Students focus their attention on the task at hand, and not on \\"an inaccessible and confusing multitude of explicit rules and strategies.\\" Writing in the disciplines Many university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research. Writing center Many colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW), for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe. Since multimodality has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the digital studio and the multiliteracy center.

The name can also refer to the adjoining artificial Lake Sava and its beach. To take advantage of its central location, over the past few decades, it was turned into an immensely popular recreational zone, most notable for its beaches and sports facilities, which, during summer seasons, can have over 100,000 visitors daily and up to 300,000 visitors over the weekend. Owing to this popularity, Ada Ciganlija has been commonly nicknamed \\"More Beograda\\" (\\"Belgrade's Sea\\"), which was officially accepted as an advertising slogan in 2008, stylised as More BeogrADA.  Location  Location of Ada between Novi Beograd and the rest of ƒåukarica. Satellite view on Ada Ciganlija Ada Ciganlija is located on the southern bank of the Sava River, 4 km away from its mouth, and entirely belongs to Belgrade's municipality of ƒåukarica. Its eastern tip roughly borders the urban neighborhood of Senjak on the west (across an inlet called ƒåukarica Bay), and the body of the peninsula borders the neighborhoods of ƒåukarica and Maki≈° (both across Lake Sava). Across the river, Ada Ciganlija borders Novi Beograd (specifically residential bloks and the urban neighborhoods of Savski Nasip) and another artificial peninsula called Mala Ciganlija (\\"Little Ciganlija\\"). Between Ada Ciganlija and Novi Beograd lies Ada Meƒëica, a wholly insulated river island.  Geography  Formerly an island, Ada Ciganlija is now an elongated peninsula, stretching for 6 km from west to east and 700 m from north to south at its widest, and covering an area of 2.7 km2. The entire Ada Ciganlija ecological complex, which stretches into the municipality of Novi Beograd, covers an area of 8 km2, including the islands of Ada Ciganlija and Ada Meƒëica, waterways between the two Adas and Lake Sava, and some of Maki≈° itself. Lake Sava, formerly a branch of the Sava, was turned into a lake with two dams, while the remaining section on the northeast was turned into ƒåukarica Bay. There is another small lake on Ada Ciganlija itself, known as Ada Safari. Thanks to the combination of factors, Ada Ciganlija is privileged with a microclimate. Situated between a river, an artificial flowing lake, various islands, and a heavily wooded area, air humidity is heightened compared to the rest of the city, helping to nullify Belgrade's high temperatures during summer.  Hydrology  = Lake Sava = Ada Ciganlija and Lake Sava (blue water) Lake Sava (Serbian: –°–∞–≤—Å–∫–æ —ò–µ–∑–µ—Ä–æ, Savsko jezero), often also referred to as Ada, was created from the right arm of the Sava with the building of two dams near the northern and southern tips of the island in 1967. The lake is long, has an average width of and is deep. It covers and area of and is above sea level, one of the lowest areas of Belgrade. of its shores on both sides have been transformed into a gravel beach. The water regularly reaches during summer. Both dams allow water to flow through tubes and pumps. This way, the main body of the lake is connected to the smaller body of water on the southwest, which is itself separated from the river by the third dam. This mini \\"buffer\\" lake called Talo≈ænik (\\"depository\\") is used as a purifier for the waters of both Lake Sava and city waterworks, which also use this water. Filtered water is constantly being pumped into the lake while on the northeast, the water is pumped out by electrically powered pumps through another dam into ƒåukarica Bay. In this way, an artificial flow of water through the lake is created. Because the water is also used for drinking, sanitation and environmental protection of the lake are imperative and the lake is under rigorous environmental protection. Weeds are groomed on the lake's bottom to purify the water by bonding phosphorus, nitrogen and dirt. Use of motorboats is strictly prohibited in the lake and dogs are not allowed on the beach. Wildlife in the lake mostly consists of the fish species which were introduced since the 1950s. The most common fish in the lake are the introduced silver carp and grass carp, but large autochthonous wels catfish, weighting over , can also be found, causing concern among the swimmers so the authorities issued a statement that they are harmless. In March 2019, a long catfish was caught in the lake. Catfish of this size is a rarity and, as required by the law, it was returned in to the lake. Other catfishes of this size were reported by the divers in previous years, but they lay lazily on the bottom of the lake, not swimming to the surface. There are 20 to 25 fish species in the lake, including the autochthonous carp, northern pike, zander, common bream, asp and European perch, and the imported, and highly invasive brown bullhead, Prussian carp and pumpkinseed. There are also crayfish and crabs, and since 2010s, the red-eared slider inhabits the lake, too, probably being released in the lake by the owners who kept them as pets. The freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbyi was discovered in 2008, garnering much attention for the lake. These anthomedusae begin their life as polyps and develop into jellyfish only if conditions, such as purity and water temperature over 25 ¬∞C, are right. However, authorities claim that these harmless and almost invisible jellyfish (they are only to wide, bell is in diameter and have no sting cells) actually have been present in the lake for over 20 years. The first specimens were discovered in 1994 and they can also be found in the Danube. They live only for several days. = Ada Safari = Ada Safari () is a small, irregularly shaped lake on the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija, primarily used for fishing. In the late 1960s, the hole was formed as the sand was dug to construct the permanent embankment which connected Ada Ciganlija to the mainland, turning it into the peninsula by 1974. It was the last remaining marshy area during the transformation Ada Ciganlija, infested by undergrowth and reeds, until its conversion into a lake in 1994, long, with an area of . It was officially opened in 1995. The water pumps are used to fill the lake, bringing water from the Sava Lake. Rare species of fish were introduced in order to create a fishing resort, which now consists of 300 numbered fishing seats around the lake with an obligatory special permit for fishing. Fish species include common carp, grass carp, crucian carp, wels catfish, Prussian carp, zander and tench, which is rare in Serbia. Fish are mostly released back into the lake as fishermen can keep their catch in case if the fish is lighter than , if they pay extra and if it is not a tench, which is protected by the law. Some animals roam freely in the area, like rabbits, ducks, geese and swans. A small zoo has been built next to the lake, chiefly containing swamp birds, as well as more exotic animals such as peacocks, pheasants and pygmy goats. There is also a restaurant on the shore and a typical Serbian 18th century house from ≈†umadija which was deconstructed from the Central Serbia and transferred here. The house was originally built around 1735 in the village of Junkovac, near Topola. There is also a \\"Magical forest\\", an area for the kids with reproductions of the fairytale characters: Evil Witch, Cinderella, Wolf and the Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man, etc. There is a small stream over which the bridge and the cross, both made from timber, have been constructed. Fish are especially prepared for the winter in the process of \\"winter carp bathing\\". In the second week of November each year, fish (up to 9 tonnes in total) are taken from the lake to the shore by the professional fishermen. The lake is then emptied and the largest fish specimens are \\"bathed\\" in the small bathtubs with the water mixed with the medical, healing ingredients. = ƒåukarica Bay = The arm of the Sava river which separated the island from the mainland was called ƒåukarica Arm (–ß—É–∫–∞—Ä–∏—á–∫–∏ —Ä—É–∫–∞–≤–∞—Ü). Serbian Shipping Society, which was founded in 1890, decided to use the arm as the zimovnik, or winter shelter for ships and boats. Upstream from ƒåukarica, at the time suburban village of Belgrade, the Society dammed the arm with slanted, shackled, thick triangular piles, called pilotne. Facing the stream, they stopped the ice which would then elevate itself slab by slab until it reaches over the top of the piles and breaks into pieces. The stream would then take smaller pieces next to the docked ships. In the case of complete freezing of the river, the tugboats were deployed, with crew members being armed with axes, grappling hooks and dynamite. As the Society built and kept zimovnik on its own, without state help, they charged the use of the object. In the arm's central section, on ƒåukarica bank, the first shipbuilding facility in Serbia was opened. Though the engines had to be acquired abroad, the shipyard was producing smaller and medium-sized steamboats. Known as the ƒåukarica Shipyard (ƒåukariƒçka brodarnica), it also repaired all Serbian ships and continuously produced iron-made barges of all kinds and sizes for Serbian and Bulgarian markets. When Ada was connected to the mainland via the embankments in 1967, northern section of the arm was transformed into the ƒåukarica Bay (–ß—É–∫–∞—Ä–∏—á–∫–∏ –∑–∞–ª–∏–≤), though the previous name survived, too. The arm is elongated in the southwest-northeast direction, bounded by the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija, the embankment and the right bank of the Sava (neighborhoods of Careva ƒÜuprija and southern stretch of Bara Venecija, formerly known as ≈†est Topola). This is where the Topƒçiderka river flows into the Sava. Near the connection point with the main flow of the Sava, the bay is today crossed by the Ada Bridge. The bay is used for the sports and leisure activities as the kayaking clubs were located in it, so as the marina for small boats, while the banks are encircled with the bicycle paths. The bay is long and wide. Surface of the bay itself is , but the area which city administration included in the bay locality includes and additional of aquatorium and of the surrounding land. In March 2018 city announced an urban design competition for the adaptation of the total bay area (). The forested area on the mainland, at the entrance into the bay, administratively belongs to the municipality of Savski Venac and covers . Since the early 1980s there is a constant ecological problem due to the massive pollution of the bay as a result of the polluted waters of the Topƒçiderka river. The garbage and highly polluted silt fills the bay and creates shoals. During low-tide, the bay is unusable for the boats in the marina, located in the middle of the bay or for the kayakers of Partizan and Crvena Zvezda who use the bay for practice. The silt is up to thick, smells bad and is poisonous so the swimming in the bay is forbidden. In 2011 the estimated amount of garbage sludge in the bay was . The sludge cannot simply be dredged and thrown in the Sava further downstream due to the toxicity. The plan to build a treatment plant on the bank near the Belgrade Fair which would detoxicate the sludge and produce fertilizer from it was scrapped due to the high costs. For now, the silt is being dredged and vegetation cut just enough to make it navigable for the small boats in the marina. The pollution of the bay continued, including two atmospheric precipitation collectors which overspill into the bay, to which the fecal sewage is illegally connected, and the bay was described as the ecological time bomb. In December 2019 the winning project was announced. It includes the transformation of the bay into the artificial whitewater and the proper marina. A project by Aleksandar Nedeljkoviƒá, named \\"Flight of the gull\\" envisions the reconstruction and elevation of all embankments along the bay's banks, turning them into the vertical retaining walls. Pumps for the creation of the whitewater by day, would be used to purify the water by night and prevent the sludge from depositing on the bottom. Proposed name for the marina and sports center is \\"Whitewater Arena\\". However, this project, just like some others from the competition (conducting the Topƒçiderka directly into the main Sava riverbed by the pipes) does not tackle the problem of the already existing sludge deposits or the toxicity of the waste. Also, it was outright labeled as way too expensive, even by its authors (up to ‚Ç¨70 million). Wildlife Ada Ciganlija has a unique ecosystem, creating an oasis in the urban area. Most of the peninsula is forested. The original, thick deciduous forest mainly consists of oaks, elms, birches and willows. In the mid 20th century, further planned forestation of Ada Ciganlija included the planting of American poplars and green ash. In 2010, total forested area covered , or two thirds of the island. This characteristic of Ada gives its visitors an illusion of being in complete wilderness, aided by the fact that city ambient noise is completely muted by the thick forest. Most of the forest on the island is protected, including the entire central, northern and western sections. These parts of the peninsula are entirely wild with uncultivated vegetation and very little or no human presence, making it unique compared to other European city islands and peninsulas. Part of the Ada's central forested complex was declared a protected habitat \\"Fungi of Ada Ciganlija\\" by the city on 29 November 2013. Apart from the wood fauna characterized for the wet soils, it hosts 250 species of fungi, many of which are listed on Serbian and international lists of rare or endangered species. It is the only known habitat in Serbia of Myriostoma coliforme. Pygmy cormorant In terms of fauna, besides having numerous amphibians and insects, Ada Ciganlija contains several mammal species, considered special due to the setting of the peninsula in an urban area. Foxes, hares and roe deer inhabit the peninsula. However, with environmentalists warning that the island's biocoenosis has been overly affected, a new population of 60 hares and 100 pheasants was introduced into the ecosystem in 2006. Bird species include more common lapwings, mallards, quails and pheasants. Common woodland and parkland birds during the nesting season include great tit, blue tit, long-tailed tit, Eurasian nuthatch, European green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, golden oriole, nightingale, blackcap, common chaffinch, hooded crow, European magpie, common wood pigeon, feral pigeon, white wagtail and barn swallow. Ada is also the wintering ground for some threatened migratory birds, most notably the pygmy cormorant which winters in Belgrade in large numbers. Pygmy cormorant inhabited the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit marshland, just north of Belgrade, in the early 20th century, but after that area was drained and urbanized, they disappeared. Several hundreds of birds in the early 1990s began spending winters on the Malo Ratno Ostrvo, in the Danube. When their number exceeded 1,000, they resettled to three new locations: first at the willow grove on the Sava's bank (Belgrade Fair) and then to the area near the tip of Ada and the neighboring Mala Ciganlija. Their number rose every year to 6,750 in 2007/08, but since then is generally reducing and in 2015 it was 3,850 which is still 5,4% of the European and 2% of the world's pygmy cormorant population. There were concerns that the building of the new Ada Bridge in 2008-12 would disturb the habitat, but the birds endured it well. Their habitat was protected by law in 2008. Any destruction, clearing or pruning of the vegetation is forbidden, so as scaring, disturbing or killing of the birds. Settlements =Partizan= The only settlement on Ada Ciganlija is in its northern section, located behind another dam. It is called Partizan, because of the nearby Partizan rowing club. City authorities plan to relocate the settlement. During the 2006 European floods, city authorities urged them to move to the mainland from the settlement, which was located almost below the dam, as the Sava reached a record height of . The wall of the dam, on the brink of collapse, was hastily strengthened and elevated in an effort to prevent catastrophe, but even in these conditions, the populace refused to relocate, claiming the city to just be using the situation to relocate them. In 1959 the construction of the settlement was suggested and the first houses were built in 1960. Those were small, serial weekend houses with an area of . Most of the original construction was finished from 1964 to 1966. As the nearby Ada Safari wasn't adapted yet and was a marshland, original settlers, who were from the upper classes, were leaving and instead the workers who migrated from the interior of Serbia settled in. Additional boost was an influx of refugees from the Yugoslav Wars since 1991. As their families grew, inhabitants expanded the houses. As of 2016 Partizan had some 1,000 inhabitants in 260 houses covering an area of . By the latest urbanistic plans, the settlement is still to be evacuated as it is built without any permits and is located in the zone of the sanitary protection. = Old Bath = Close to the northern tip, as the northeastern extension of Partizan settlement, there is an Old Bath \\"Partizan\\" (Staro Kupatilo). Since 1983 it has been a location of an artistic colony, occupied by the painters and sculptors. In the 1980s the venue organized many artistic exhibitions. After the 2006 floods a project of reconstruction of the embankment to prevent the flooding was introduced. The embankment, which was to prevent 25 Renney water wells from being flooded, passes right through the bath building which was to be demolished so that this gap in the embankment can be filled. The gap, which is considered the weakest section of the entire embankment system on the island is just from the Partizan settlement. Next to the building is the parking for the communal vehicles used for the works on Ada. In 2011, the management ordered the artists to move out. As of 2017, the building still stands. History Nomenclature The etymology of the name could be Celtic in origin, which probably is the most likely scenario. Some believe that it is derived by some form of the word for Romani (cigani, \\"gypsies\\"), attested in 1717 as when it was mentioned as a depopulated village after the Austrian takeover of Belgrade. An Italian work from 1788 mentions it as Isola degli Zingari. The original toponym might have been singalia, from Celtic Singi (cf. Singidunum). During World War II it was renamed \\"Serbian Ada\\" (Srpska ada). The first part of Ada Ciganlija's name, ada, means \\"river island\\" in Serbian, a word of Turkish origin (meaning \\"island\\"), but in landlocked Serbia it specifically denotes river islands, beside the already existing Serbian word for island, ostrvo. A river island can also be referred to as ostrvo (e.g. Veliko Ratno Ostrvo) but never vice versa.  Human history  = Antiquity = The remains belonging to the Scordisci, a Celtic tribe which founded Singidunum and Taurunum, the predecessors of Belgrade and Zemun, respectively, were found. = 1680s-1914 = Serbian Army on Ada Ciganlija during World War I Area of Ostru≈ænica, near the southern tip of Ada Ciganlija, was a location of the Long Bridge, the first permanent bridge in Belgrade's history. As the opposing, Syrmian side across the Sava was a vast marsh at the time (modern New Belgrade), the bridge didn't stop at the bank but continued for some length above the swamp. Because of that, the people also called it the Bridge above the marsh (Most preko moƒçvare). The bridge was built by the Austrians to help them conquer Belgrade from the Ottomans during the 1688 Siege of Belgrade. According to the records, a seasoned Belgrade master craftsman ƒêorƒëeviƒá \\"in only one month, with the help of his 400 workers, built the Long Bridge, using 2,000 tree trunks, 1,100 wooden piles, 15,500 bundles of palings and 12,000 palisade pickets.\\" Right next to it, bit closer to Ada Ciganlija, the Austrians constructed another, classical pontoon bridge, which \\"leaned on the Long Bridge\\". The Romani settlement which existed on Ada in the 17th century was displaced from the island to the Sava's right bank, at the mouth of the Topƒçiderka, before the Austrian occupation of Belgrade from 1717 to 1739. It is not known whether it happened some time before or during the fighting from 1716 to 1718. One map from the Austrian period shows a Romani settlement with 24 houses at the mouth of Topƒçiderka. Maps also show that the settlement existed during the next Austrian occupation from 1788 to 1791. When the Austrian army attacked Belgrade in the 18th century, the Ottomans expelled Serbian population from the city, so they temporarily settled on Ada. When Belgrade was liberated by the Serbian rebels in the First Serbian Uprising, leader of the uprising, Karaƒëorƒëe, granted the island to Mladen Milovanoviƒá, the first city chief. After the collapse of the uprising, Milovanoviƒá fled to Hungary, but returned in 1813 and unsuccessfully tried to find the gold which he has dug and hidden somewhere on Ada. The importance of Ada Ciganlija can be traced back to 1821, when it was declared a protected public domain by then Prince of Serbia, Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. The first official urban plan for Belgrade was drafted in 1867. It was a work of Emilijan Josimoviƒá, the first Serbian trained urbanist. He envisioned Ada as the main sports' center of Belgrade and was to be transformed in the \\"source of fresh air\\", a term Josimoviƒá used for large forests. Neglected since then, Ada came to the spotlight in 1908 when the Society of the Belgrade's journalists organized the first journalists' ball on the lower tip of Ada. In 1911, the first Serbian feature-length motion picture, The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Vo≈æd Karaƒëorƒëe was filmed on the island. = World War I = On 28 July 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, thus triggering the World War I, Serbian forces spread over the island to prevent Austrians to use it as the starting point of entering Serbia. Two major battles ensued, on 22‚Äì24 September 1914 and in September 1915. In an effort to exploit the withdrawal of the Serbian army from Syrmia in September 1914, Austro-Hungarian Lieutenant field marshal decided to conduct the feint attack on the Sava rivers (Ciganlija and Meƒëica) which was to be followed by the landing operation on the Serbian side of the river, conquering of the neighborhoods of Banovo Brdo and Topƒçider and then, using the western route, entering downtown Belgrade. Attack began on 22 September when the first group of the Austrians attempted to land on the southern tip of Ada. The location was defended from the blockhouse \\"He-goat\\", across the river in the Maki≈° forest. Under strong fire from the blockhouse, Austrians landed more to the north, in the area which Serbs didn't even defend because it was the plain marsh and it was thought that no one will land there. That way, Austrians successfully landed on the island without much resistance. Major Dobrivoje Mojsiloviƒá, acting commander of the Ada's defense, engaged the Austrians in an effort to force them to retreat across the river. Serbian reserve was sent to the battle and major Mojsiloviƒá, who was wounded, was replaced by major Svetomir ƒêukiƒá. After several charges which resulted in hand-to-hand combat, Serbs cornered Austrians on the Ada's northern tip. During that time, behind Serbian back, Austria landed more troops from Meƒëica so the Serbian forces ended being encircled. They managed to break out but by that time they were attacked from the flank by the new Austrian forces. Serbs retreated to the easternmost section of the island and started to dig in. On 23 September Austrians conducted three charges on Serbian positions, coming close to only 30 steps from the trenches, but were backed off. As Austrian army had problems with the invasion of western Serbia and attack on ≈†abac, General asked from the commander of the forces for the entire Balkans, Oskar Potiorek, to send him two regiments from L√ºtgendorf. Potiorek not only agreed but he ordered L√ºtgendorf to reroute all forces to ≈†abac. On 24 September the Austrians withdrew. Serbs followed them to make sure it is not another ploy, but the withdrawal was complete. Serbs lost 1 officer and 17 soldiers, while the Austrian fatalities included 4 officers and 310 soldiers. There was a year long shootout between the two armies, with long calm periods in between, before the German army interfered and began non-stop heavy artillery beating of the island in the late September 1915. Hand-to-hand battle ensued and the German fighters pushed the Serbs from the island. Serbian loses were heavy, turning effectively Ada into an open graveyard, earning a moniker \\"Island of death\\". = Interbellum = During Interbellum, Ada wasn't the most popular recreational area as the major beach area was across its northern tip, in the Gospodarska Mehana section of the Senjak neighborhood. Still, even then, one of major Serbian writers Branislav Nu≈°iƒá, nicknamed it Vodeni cvet (watery flower) because of its beauty. In 1920 city decided to arrange the Ada as part of the international design competition concerning the arrangement and expansion of Belgrade. Competition was announced in 1921. One of the submitted works, titled Urbs Magna (\\"Great City\\"), proposed construction of the large, multi-functional stadium and transformation of the island into the sports park. First facilities of the swimming and rowing clubs on the island were built after that. In 1936 city government adopted a new general urban plan which projected Ada as the \\"sports island\\". = World War II and after = Until 1941, a prison was located on Ada Ciganlija. On the night of July 17, 1946, new Communist authorities executed a number of former politicians on Ada Ciganlija, while military officers were tried as collaborators with the Nazis during World War II, including Chetniks leaders Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and Kosta Mu≈°icki, and ministers in the government of Milan Nediƒá: Tanasije-Tasa Diniƒá, ƒêura Dokiƒá and Velibor Joniƒá. Despite other plans, Ada was a prison from 1928 to 1954 and was nicknamed the \\"Little Serbian Alcatraz\\". It was established on the notion of the king Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the prisoners include Milovan ƒêilas, Mo≈°a Pijade and Borislav Pekiƒá. In 1947, a public swimming pool was built behind the premises of the \\"Crvena Zvezda\\" rowing club. Known as the \\"Sever pool\\" (Severov bazen), it became quite popular as it was one of the rare such venues in Belgrade in those days. Many swimmers held preparations for the Olympic games in it. In 1957 city government decided to put in order the neglected, feral island. The beach was gradually prolonged as the overgrowth and trees were cut and cleared, under the strict control by the experts from the University of Belgrade Forestry Faculty. Works on transforming the island began in 1960. By September 1961 an embankment on the outer side of the island was finished. It is long, wide at the crown and prevented the Sava to flood the island every spring, like it used to do. Already at the time, Ada was the largest and the most visited swimming and excursion site. , engineer and a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts suggested the dual solution for Ada, as both the source of the drinking water and a sports and recreation center. His plan was conducted by 1967 when Ada was connected to the mainland on both the north and south tips, and the Sava Lake and the settling basin Talo≈ænik. An underground pipeline was built in 1969 which conducted water from the river into the newly formed lake. The water is being purified in the Talo≈ænik, before being conducted further into the lake and to the Belgrade's major water facility in Maki≈°. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the first sporting championships were organized, such as the kayaking championships in 1971, prompting the construction of special facilities. The popularity of Ada was further increased in the 1980s with the music and entertainment show Leto na Adi (\\"Summer on Ada\\"), televised live by the Radio Television of Serbia. Also in the 1980s, partial clearing of the wood on the Maki≈° side began, so as the filling of the beach on that side. In time, a continuous, over long beach around the entire lake was formed. Maki≈° side was officially declared a swimming area in the season of 2010. In June 2017 construction of two new pipelines which would increase the amount of water transferred from the Talo≈ænik to the water treatment facility in Maki≈° began. As a result, during the works in the off-season 2018-2019, the lake level was significantly lowered. Ada Ciganlija is today managed by the municipal government via the Public Enterprise \\"Ada Ciganlija\\" (JP \\"Ada Ciganlija\\"), which maintains the grounds of the recreational areas and, especially, the beach and Lake Sava. It is responsible for cleanliness, maintenance such as trimming of the underwater algae, public safety (lifeguards), and so on. Even though the island is a public asset, the island itself is not exclusively managed and owned by the city. There are numerous private entities that administer businesses and recreation facilities, such as the golf course. Notably, many famous Serbian sports personalities have invested in the area.  Facilities, activities and tourism  Ada Ciganlija beach. The heavily wooded Maki≈° can be seen across Lake Sava Apart from the sport facilities, a 7 kilometer-long beach of Lake Sava has a closely supervised, fenced-off children's swimming area. Ada Ciganlija features a tall sports observation tower and bleachers on multiple levels which is its most prominent structure as well and one of very few permanent solid structures. One of those structures is the \\"Jezero\\" hotel at the entrance. The northern edge of the island is lined with attached floating barges, or houses on the water owned by many inhabitants of Belgrade as a weekend refuge given the peninsula's exceptionally quiet and green environment. In addition, many city dwellers come to enjoy fishing excursions, picnics and barbecues. From the beach, stunning views of central Belgrade can be seen, and sunsets are particularly beautiful when viewed from here.  Sport  Water skiing The island has been conceptualised as Belgrade's focal point for mass sporting activity and recreation. As such, it features a great number of facilities, which get more numerous every year. They include: {- valign=top  *tennis courts *bike paths *volleyball courts *beach volleyball courts *soccer fields *five-a-side football fields *skateboarding ramps *rollerskating paths *basketball courts *a paintball field  *baseball fields *bocce facilities * Water football facilities *rugby fields *kayaking facilities *an artificial rock climbing wall *chess facilities *water slides *rowing facilities *diving range  *artificial alpine skiing slope *artificial snowboarding slope *bungee jumping platform *trim trail *fishing facilities *cable skiing facilities *canoeing facilities *water polo courts *pedalos *a golf course } * American football Ada Ciganlija has in the past been a host to a number of local and international water sporting events such as competitions in rowing and kayaking. The very first golf course in Serbia has been built on this island in recent years along with a golf club house, a golfing store, golfing school and a practice range. This golf course is also the seat of the first and so far only Serbian golfing association. Also there is a separated cycling and rollerblading path that goes full circle around the lake (approximately 8 km long) and is connected to the path that goes all the way by the Sava river in downtown. The island is home to the \\"Rowing Sport Club\\" and several rowing societies like VK Partizan, VK Crvena Zvezda, and VK Grafiƒçar. A sailing school and club, in addition to all accompanying sailing facilities, can be found on Ada Ciganlija.  Restaurants and nightlife  Lounge For decades, Ada Ciganlija was popular among loners and fishermen, including the famous actor Pavle Vujisiƒá. After his death in 1988, it was proposed that the access road to Ada should be named after him, but another street in the new neighborhood of Altina in Zemun was later named after him. Other famous bohemians which dwelled occasionally on Ada after the 1960s were actor Dragan Nikoliƒá, writers Momo Kapor and Zuko D≈æumhur and opera singers and Milka Stojanoviƒá. Nobelist author Ivo Andriƒá called Ada the \\"Boka Kotorska of Belgrade\\" and the \\"Green jewel of our Pannonian rivers\\". Number of splavovi (float barges) began to grow by the late 1970s and the visitors began to include the members of the political and business elite also, including mayor ≈Ωivorad Kovaƒçeviƒá. One of the first barges was \\"JAT\\", opened in the late 1970s. It was originally intended only for the employees of the JAT Airways, but soon became a gathering place for the regular clientele, becoming a famous venue in the city. It was derelict by the 2000s, when it was sold to a private owner. Before it was renovated, the barge detached and was taken by the river downstream. The owner took only emergency measures to keep it afloat, but in January 2019 it sank under the heavy snowfall. The barge itself was considered one of the best on the river. \\"Argument\\", the first restaurant on splav in Belgrade was opened in 1983. It looked like a \\"railroad car\\", without any specificities. In the 1990s it was relocated to the neighborhood of U≈°ƒáe. At the time, Ada wasn't that well connected to the rest of the city which gave this venues a certain aura of exclusivity. Splav \\"Sara\\" was the very first venue in Belgrade with solely electronic music. It was opened only for a year in 1994. Belgrade has a reputation for offering a vibrant nightlife, and many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognizable nightlife features of Belgrade are the splavovi, spread along the banks of the Sava and Danube Rivers. The island has over 70 restaurants, bars and caf√©s as well as a caf√©-cinema.  Ada Mall  First ideas of building a shopping mall on ƒåukarica side, across the Ada Ciganlija entrance where the former \\"Minel Dinamo\\" company was, appeared in 2007. Construction began in March 2017 and the object was opened on 24 May 2019, under the name of Ada Mall (Ada Mol). It has 5 floors, total floor area of over and atypical, attractive design, compared to the usual box-shaped malls in Belgrade: it has wavy fa√ßade with terraces and step-like floors. Construction itself was already problematic, both financially (connections with the mayor Sini≈°a Mali) and in terms of building process. After a while, investor reached a bedrock and decided to use dynamite. As the mall is embedded into the cliff which is fully urbanized on top, and dynamite explosions were used for almost a year, houses and buildings of the residents cracked in time. The roof tiles were falling off, while window frames separated from the walls. In the end, the residents received no support from either the investor or the city government, as municipal inspector concluded that the cracks on dozen houses are not caused by the explosions below. As the opening of the facility was hurried, so that it could be opened ceremonially by the politicians, it wasn't fully finished when it was opened. Some sections were empty, dirty and covered in dust, the walls were naked, without panels, floor panels were badly placed, and electric wires were protruding into the corridors. The fa√ßade wasn't completely finished either, while some works on the access paths and the building itself have been reported as \\"slack\\". In the next several months, streak of bad luck for the object continued. Already in June it was evacuated two times in just couple of days, after it got flooded during the heavy rains. This gave the facility a nickname \\"Kada Mol\\" (kada, Serbian for bathtub). In July it was evacuated again because of the faulty alarm system, and in September due to the sabotage of the same system. The original project also envisioned a footbridge (pasarela), which would directly connect the mall with the pedestrian section of the Radniƒçka Street. The footbridge hasn't been constructed, but the investor, who estimated the cost of the short pedestrian bridge to ‚Ç¨1 million, promised it will be built by the end of 2019. Construction of the footbridge began in May 2020. It is not going to only connect the mall with the bus stop across the Pa≈°troviƒáeva Street, as originally planned, but will continue from there across the Radniƒçka Street, reaching the entrance area of Ada Ciganlija. Deadline was set for September 2020. In June 2020, construction of another footbridge to Ada Ciganlija was announced, a bit further from the Ada Moll. It will directly connect the neighborhood of ƒåukariƒçka Padina with hypermarket Tempo Centar, and further with Ada Ciganlija, over the 8-lane Obrenovac Road. Deadline is set for June 2021.  Landmarks  Art Water and light show by the lake One of the island's most noted landmarks is the fountain, based on the famous Jet d'Eau (water-jet), situated in Lake Geneva. The Belgrade one is also 140 metres high and it was installed in 1996. The fountain operates during the day all year round, except in case there is frost or a particularly strong wind. It also operates in the evening between spring and autumn and is lit by a set of lights. During the summer months in the later hours, the island stages a special laser light spectacle for those still present at the beach. This Island also has an artistic sculpture workshop located at the eastern end in the direction of the city. Ada Ciganlija also has a children's theatre featuring scheduled performances, as well as a Robinson Crusoe-themed entertainment feature that stages themed performances.  Transportation  View from airplane Although there are land routes leading to the island across the artificial dams, they are seldom used due to poor accessibility to the city's main roads and public transport system. Numerous routes of the city's public transport (GSP Beograd) pass close to the eastern entrance: bus routes 23, 37, 51, 52, 53, 56, 56L, 57, 58, 88, 89, 91, 92, 511, 551 and 552, while tram lines 12 and 13 also pass relatively nearby. Due to the ever-larger number of visitors, GSP Beograd introduced special seasonal bus lines, specifically designated for transport to Ada Ciganlija from distant parts of Belgrade. They have been expanding in recent years: Ada1 (Central Belgrade and Vidikovac), Ada2 (Zemun, Blokovi), Ada3 (Konjarnik), Ada4 (Mirijevo), Ada5 (Be≈æanijska Kosa, Novi Beograd). There are regular ferry services to take people from Belgrade's river banks onto the island. In 2008, experimental introduction of public transport by boat began, one of whose routes is from Blok 44 (Novi Beograd)-Ada Ciganlija. There is also a small electric road vehicle that tours the island called the \\"tourist train\\". There is also an impromptu recreational marina on the island's downstream end. There are plans to expand this marina and make it permanent. Boating in the lake, as well as car traffic on land, is strictly forbidden. There is a large parking lot on the Maki≈° side of the river. In 1922 company \\"ƒåavlina and Sladoljev\\" from Zagreb drafted the project of connecting two banks of the Sava river by the cable car. In 1928, building company \\"≈†umadija\\" again proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called \\"air tram\\" but this project was planned to connect Zemun to Kalemegdan on Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project never realized. Engineer and CEO of the Yugoslav institute for urbanism and dwelling \\"Juginus\\", Mirko Radovanac, revived the idea in the 1990s. After conducting extensive surveys (traffic analysis, interviews with the commuters, climatic, geological, urban and other researches), \\"Juginus\\" presented the project in 1993. They proposed that the terminuses should be at the Sports Center Ko≈°utnjak and Block 44 in the neighborhood of Savski Blokovi in New Belgrade, across the Sava. Stops in between would include the major public transportation roundabout in Banovo Brdo, Maki≈° and Ada Ciganlija, five in total. They called it the \\"ideal route\\". The plan also included construction of commercial areas around the terminuses, which would cover and help with the profitability of the project. Apart from being ecological and an attraction, it was estimated that it would shorten the trip for 45 minutes. City government included the project into the city's General Urban Plan, which envisioned the construction in phases, the first being a long section Block 44-Ada Ciganlija. It would lay on 8 steel pillars, above the ground and the trip would last for 3 minutes. The cabins were projected to receive not just the commuters, but also the bicycles, skateboards, sledges and skis, as the cableway was planned to work year-round. The complete facility would have of 27 pillars, it would be long which would be travelled in 15 minutes by 2,000 commuters per hour. Despite the project has been publicly revived by the mayors Dragan ƒêilas (2008‚Äì2013) and Sini≈°a Mali (2013-2018), it is still on hold.  Bridges  = Ada Bridge = Ada Bridge, opened for traffic on 1 January 2012 A new cable-stayed bridge is being built across the Sava, over the eastern tip of the Ada Ciganlija. The bridge is set to be a future landmark due to its height and grandeur. The central abutment is to be 200 meters tall, carrying hundreds of cables suspending the bridge. It will provide a direct land link to the island via the elevators as well as a planned light rail station that will stop mid- bridge to service passengers to and from the island. = Ada Bridge II = When plans were made for the Ada Bridge, one of the proposals was the location on the opposite, upstream tip of Ada Ciganlija, instead of the downstream one, where it was built in the end. It would connect Maki≈° on the right, and Savski Nasip on the left bank of the Sava. When Ada Bridge was close to be finished, architects suggested this other location as the place where the next Belgrade bridge might or should be built. = New Belgrade-Ada Ciganlija Bridge = In March 2020, it was announced that the construction of the first pedestrian- cyclist bridge in Belgrade will commence in 2021. It will connect New Belgrade with the island of Ada Ciganlija across the Sava, as the continuation of the Omladinskih Brigada street in Block 70. Public, partially underground garage with 300 parking spots will be built at the end of the street. This is the second part of the project city administration alleged is the result of citizens' online voting (first part is relocation of the Old Sava Bridge on dry land, in the Park U≈°ƒáe to become an \\"attraction\\"). Reporters and public distanced from the voting or debunked it as being rigged.  Social aspect  Ever since Ada Ciganlija began gaining popularity, there have been varying views of its importance. During the economic hardship of the 1980s and subsequent wars of the 1990s, it was often regarded as an \\"necessary evil\\", as the only resort available to masses of economically disadvantaged people. Use of this recreation area has always been free of charge, leading to it often being overcrowded and regarded as having poor hygiene, because, for decades, Ada had no proper facilities or institutionalised care. That has changed however, and the zone is today properly maintained, and has suitable infrastructure and appropriate commercial and recreational content. It is now possible to play sports that were not even invented when transformation of Ada began and it has become a highly popular gathering place, especially among youth, and a must-see destination for foreign tourists visiting Belgrade.

The act established penalties of up to five years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine ($1,000,000 fine for a corporation or other legal entity) for selling or attempting to sell counterfeit goods or services. It increased such penalties for a second or subsequent conviction under the Act. Trademark infringement Trademark infringement involves the determination of the probability of confusion by consumers between two marks. Similarity of appearance, phonetics, and meaning as well as channels of trade, direct competitiveness, strength of the famous mark, and evidence of actual confusion can determine trademark infringement. Remedies of trademark infringement include, but are not limited to; attorneys' fees, destruction of infringing products and any other materials bearing the infringing mark, profits obtained by the counterfeiter from the infringing products, and injunction relief. History Trademark Act of 1870 Trademark law dates back to the age of President Ulysses S. Grant starting in the late 19th century with the Trademark Act of 1870. The Trademark Act of 1870 was the first trademark act passed in the nation and grounded trademark protection into Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. The act covered many different aspects of trademark law but failed to cover trademark counterfeiting. After much protest from merchants and manufactures around the country, Congress amended the act to make counterfeiting a crime. This however was short lived, as the case U.S. v. Steffens in 1879 ruled that Article One of the Constitution could not serve as a basis of authority and thus making the Trademark Act of 1870 unconstitutional. All trademark acts after the 1870 one, including the 1881 Trademark Act and the 1946 Trademark Act (The Lanham Act), make no mention of the trademark counterfeiting provision of the 1870 act. By the 1970s, counterfeiting was costing U.S. companies billions of dollars, upwards of $100 billion in the years leading up to the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984. Unless the counterfeiting manufacturer was large enough, little could be done to prosecute illegal counterfeiters. Most counterfeit manufactures were small companies that once a civil suit was filed against them, would virtually disappear. Lack of penalties for counterfeiters also meant that products could be sold that were not safe and up to regulatory standards including medications, cosmetics, and machinery parts. In October 1984, after much lobbying by industry groups, mainly the International Anti- Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 (S.875). Senator Charles Mathias Jr., the Chairman of the subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks of the Senate Judiciary Committee sponsored the act. In enacting the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984, Congress sought to provide trademark owners with more powerful weapons against persons involved in trademark counterfeiting, including protection of not only intentional copying of trademarks, but also entire products as well. Those who were in favor of the act were pleased with it while those against it claimed it was \\"manifestly unfair\\", \\"heavy-handed\\", and \\"overreaching\\". Penalties under the act > The Senate and House bills both aimed at accomplishing three primary changes > in the law: First, creation of criminal penalties for intentionally dealing > in materials that one knows to be counterfeit; second, authorization for > mandatory or virtually mandatory awards of treble (sic) damages and > attorneys fees in civil counterfeiting cases; and third, authorization for > ex parte court orders for the seizure of counterfeit materials when it can > be shown that the defendant would be likely to attempt to conceal or > transfer the materials. The Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 made it illegal for anyone to intentionally traffic or attempt to traffic goods or services knowingly using a counterfeit mark, which is defined as > a spurious mark and spurious designations (1) used in connection with > trafficking in goods or services (2) identical with, or substantially > indistinguishable from, a mark registered for those goods and services on > the United States Patent and Trademark Office's Principal Register (whether > or not the defendant knew the mark was registered) and in use and (3) the > use of which is likely to deceive, confuse, or cause mistake on the part of > the consuming public. These counterfeit goods include numerous things such as labels, stickers, wrappers, charms, cases, tags, and patches. Originally under the act, the penalty for being convicted for trademark counterfeiting was a fine up to $100,000 and a prison sentence of up to five years plus paying attorney fees to the trademark owners. These penalties were later amended and called for a fine of up to $2 million and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years, with large companies being fined up to $5 million. If charged more than once for trademark infringement, individuals can be fined up to $5 million and/or be imprisoned for up to 20 years while corporations may be fined up to $15 million. Counterfeiters of safety-sensitive products, such as pharmaceuticals, would get the maximum penalty set forward in the act. Provision 1: ex parte seizure One of the most powerful provisions under the Trademark Act of 1984 is that of ex parte seizure. Under this part of the act, an aggrieved party may seize the counterfeit goods, business documents, and machines used that the counterfeiter has without notice to the counterfeiter. The section on ex parte seizure amends the Lanham Act, creating stronger remedies in civil cases involving the intentional use of counterfeit trademarks. Trademark registrants may apply for an ex parte seizure through the courts without notifying the counterfeiting party. The courts, however, will not grant the ex parte seizure unless # the applicant knows where the goods to be seized are located # the ex parte seizure will show that there was in fact trademark infringement # an ex parte seizure is the only order that is adequate # the applicant specifies the time period the seizure will occur within a limited time frame # the seizure is not publicized # the harm to the trademark holder is greater than the harm to the counterfeiter # immediate harm will occur without the seizure to the trademark holder and # the person obtaining the order provides security to cover the damages the adverse party may suffer due to the ex parte seizure. Provision 2 The second provision of the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 deals with damages that may be recovered against users of counterfeit trademarks; treble profits or damages (damages awarded in an amount that is three times the amount for which the wrongdoer is found liable for), whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney fees. Counterfeiting today Counterfeiting remains a growing problem in the modern world economy. The garment industry is one of the largest areas of counterfeit goods. Louis Vuitton estimates two to three million counterfeit Louis Vuitton pieces are produced each year‚Äîabout twice the number of genuine products it manufactures. Because of this, Louis Vuitton spends upwards of 5% of its revenue fighting off counterfeiters; about 1,500 actions/civil proceedings. According to the International Trademark Association, between 1991‚Äì1995, apparel and footwear companies lost 22 percent of their sales, around $2.1 billion, due to trademark counterfeiting. In addition to the garment industry, automotive parts is also a large area of counterfeit goods. The U.S auto industry alone said it would employ another 200,000-plus employees if it could manage to put counterfeit supplies out of business.

Founded in 1930 at San Francisco State University, the college social organization has chapters on 12 campuses in the United States. The stated objective of the sorority is to \\"further the awareness of women in Asian culture\\" and \\"to promote unity, lifelong friendships, leadership, and community service\\". History In 1930, ten Asian American women came together on the campus of San Francisco State University to form a sorority for women of Asian heritage, the first Chinese sorority at that campus. Their educational focus on pedagogy informed the early activities of the group, as they relied on the constitution of an educational honor society in forming their own and adopted the Greek letters Œ£, Œü and Œ† for their fledgling sorority. According to the organization's website, Œ£ŒüŒ† remained in operation \\"for the next 15 years\\" but became inactive \\"at the advent of World War II\\". At some point between the declaration of war by the United States in December 1941 and 1945, Œ£ŒüŒ† went dormant, but it was revived on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley in 1946. The educational focus of Œ£ŒüŒ† fell away, but the primary purpose of providing fellowship and philanthropy for and among Asian American women - of many Asian backgrounds - as well as providing cultural awareness about them has remained. In 1994, the sorority created an Inter-Chapter Council with six elected officers to help unite the various groups.

He furthermore served numerous administrative positions in the Ottoman Empire including minister of foreign affairs in 1856, then ambassador to Berlin in 1876, and to Vienna from 1879 to 1882.

Early life Photograph of Ibrahim Edhem Pasha by the Abdullah Fr√®res studio, circa 1877. He was born in Chios of Greek ancestry, in a Christian Greek Orthodox village on the island of Chios. Strangely, his connection to Chios is not well-documented: his son Osman Hamdi Bey claimed that he was a member of the Skaramanga family, but Edhem Pasha himself tried to efface his Greek connections.Edhem Eldem, \\"Greeks and the Greeks in Ottoman History and Turkish Historiography\\", The Historical Review (Institute for Neohellenic Research) 6:27 (2009) full text As a young boy in 1822, he was orphaned and captured by Ottoman soldiers during the massacre of the Greek population of Chios. He was sold into slavery, brought to Constantinople, and adopted by the (later) grand vizier H√ºsrev Pasha. Lacking his own children and family, H√ºsrev Pasha raised about ten children who had been orphaned or bought as slaves, many of whom ascended to important positions. The child, now named ƒ∞brahim Edhem, quickly distinguished himself with his intelligence and after having attended schools in the Ottoman Empire, he was dispatched along with a number of his peers, and under the supervision of his father, then grand vizier, and of the sultan Mahmud II himself, to Paris to pursue his studies under state scholarship. There he returned a Bachelor of Arts, and was one of the top pupils at the √âcole des Mines. He was a classmate and a friend of Louis Pasteur. He thus became Turkey's first mining engineer in the modern sense, and he started his career in this field. Family and legacy Ibrahim Edhem Pasha was the father of Osman Hamdi Bey, a well-known archaeologist and painter, as well the founder of the Istanbul Archaeology Museum and the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. Another son, Halil Edhem Eldem took up the archaeology museum after Osman Hamdi Bey's death and has been a deputy for ten years under the newly founded Turkish Republic. Yet another son, ƒ∞smail Galib Bey, is considered as the founder of numismatics as a scientific discipline in Turkey. Later generations of the family also produced illustrious names. The architect Sedat Hakkƒ± Eldem, a cousin, is one of the pillars of the search for modern architectural styles adopted by the Republic of Turkey (called the Republican style in the Turkish context) in its early years and which marks many important buildings dating from the period of the 1920s and the 1930s. A great-grandson, Burak Eldem, is a writer while another, Edhem Eldem, is a renowned historian. More names include Erol Eldem, Tiana Eldem, Levent Eldem and Ercan Eldem, an architect.

Most species were relatively small in size. The family flourished in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic periods, and has been found on numerous continents. Many members of Coelophysidae are characterized by long, slender skulls and light skeletons built for speed. One member, Coelophysis, displays the earliest known furcula in a dinosaur. Under cladistic analysis, Coelophysidae was first defined by Paul Sereno in 1998 as the most recent common ancestor of Coelophysis bauri and Procompsognathus triassicus, and all of that common ancestor's descendants. However, Tykoski (2005) has advocated for the definition to change to include the additional taxa of \\"Syntarsus\\" kayentakatae and Segisaurus halli.Tykoski, Ronald S. (2005). Anatomy, Ontogeny, and Phylogeny of Coelophysoid Theropods (PhD). University of Texas at Austin. Coelophysidae is part of the superfamily Coelophysoidea, which in turn is a subset of the larger Neotheropoda clade. As part of Coelophysoidea, Coelophysidae is often placed as sister to the Dilophosauridae family, however, the monophyly of this clade has often been disputed. The older term \\"Podokesauridae\\", named 14 years prior to Coelophysidae (which would normally grant it priority), is now usually ignored, since its type specimen was destroyed in a fire and can no longer be compared to new finds.Sereno, P. (1999). \\"Taxon Search: Coelophysidae \\". Accessed 2009-09-02. Classification  Characteristics  Coelophysids are characterized by slender, skinny builds and long, narrow skulls with large fenestrae to allow for a lighter skull. They are fairly primitive theropods, and so have fairly basal characteristics, such as hollow air sacs in the cervical vertebrae and obligate bipedalism. Their slender builds allowed them to be fast and agile runners. All known members of Coelophysidae are carnivores. One species, Coelophysis bauri has the oldest known furcula (wishbone) of any dinosaur. It has also been speculated that some species within Coelophysidae, namely Coelophysis bauri, displayed cannibalism, although the fossil evidence behind these claims has been heavily debated (Rinehart et al., 2009; Gay, 2002; Gay, 2010).Gay, R.J. (2010). Notes on Early Mesozoic Theropods (First ed.). Lulu press. pp. 9-24. Phylogenetics Coelophysidae is part of the larger superfamily of Coelophysoidea, which contains Dilophosauridae, Liliensternus, and Zupaysaurus in addition to Coelophysidae. Coelophysoidea, in turn, is part of the larger clade of Neotheropoda. Of the two major families within Coelophysoidea, Dilophosauridae and Coelophysidae, Coelophysidae is considered to be more basal. The cladogram below was recovered in a study by Matthew T. Carrano, John R. Hutchinson and Scott D. Sampson, 2005. The cladogram below follows the topology from a 2011 analysis by paleontologists Martin D. Ezcurra and Stephen L. Brusatte, modified with additional data by You Hai-Lu and colleagues in 2014.  Biogeography  Fossils of members of Coelophysidae have been found across many continents, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Powellvenator podocitus was discovered in Northwestern Argentina. Procompsognathus triassicus was discovered in Germany, and Camposaurus arizonensis is from Arizona in North America. No coelophysid fossils were known from Asia until the discovery of Panguraptor lufengensis in 2014 in the Yunnan Province of China.

The Daly Memorial Hall is named after Sir Hugh Daly, who served as the Resident of Mysore State and Chief Commissioner of Coorg (1910-). He played a vital role in signing the 1913 Treaty of Mysore, which made the Mysore Government equal to the British India Government. He was also involved in negotiating with the Madras Presidency with regards to sharing the Cauvery River water, on behalf of the Mysore State. He served as the first honorary president of the Mythic Society. He died on 24 August 1939. Origin It was the creation of both the British as well as Indian residents who were eager to know India's life, society and history, in the hope that useful and interesting information might be gathered of the history, growth and source of the civilization in which people lived. The society was the brainchild of F. J. Richards who was the Collector, Bangalore cantonment District under the Madras Presidency. Richards visualised the Mythic Society as an academic 'club'. At a meeting held at his residence on 5 May 1909, a list of members likely to be interested in this 'club' was drawn up. It had seventeen names of both European and Indian residents of Bangalore. Thus was born the Society. To the great surprise of the founders, the first year membership of the club touched 174. The foundation of the Daly Memorial Hall was laid on 30 August 1916 by Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, the Maharaja of Mysore. The construction cost was INR 24,783, out of which INR 10,000 was granted by Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, and the rest from other patrons such as Maharaja of Baroda, Begum of Bhopal and the Raja of Travancore. The completed Daly Memorial Hall was inaugurated on 25 July 1917 by the Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, Yuvaraja of Mysore.  Architecture  The facade of the hall is reminiscent of the Greco-Roman style, with fluted columns capped with capitals featuring Acanthus leaves. The floor is made of reclaimed French terracotta tiles and the roof is finished with Mangalore tiles. As of 2017, the hall had been standing for a hundred years. History It was a French priest who was destined to come to India and to leave his indelible mark on Bangalore in the form of the Daly memorial Hall. Arriving in Bangalore in 1886, the Reverend Father Antoinette Marie Tabard was attached to St. Joseph's College. However, since had come out to India to be a Missionary, teaching did not satisfy his inner urge and so he appealed to his Bishop Dr. Kleiner to send him out in the District. He wanted to identify himself with the people amongst whom he had to work. He was sent to Mysore to study the regional language Kannada under Rev. Father Reautearu. Upon the death of the Rev. Father Quenard, the Parish Priest of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Father Tabard returned to Bangalore to fill the post. From 1891 to 1926 he remained its Chaplain and Chaplain to the British troops stationed in Bangalore. Father Tabard was essential to the creation of the Mythic Society. It is said that the late Col. Desaraj Urs once offered him a pair of white mules. Father Tabard remarked that a cash donation equivalent to their value would be more welcome to the Mythic Society. The next day the Colonel sent him the pair of mules with a cheque for Rs 500. Father Tabard soon succeeded in obtaining land on Cenotaph Road and he erected the \\"Daly Memorial Hall\\" and provided it with an extensive reference library. He started its quarterly journal and established a reserve fund of Rs 10,000. The Mythic Society was founded and has rendered services to the State and continues to do so for the United Karnataka. The Mythic Society ranks among many pioneering institutions of its kind like the Royal Asiatic Society of Calcutta or the Bharath Itihasa Samshodhaka Mandal of Pune, which had strived to reconstruct India's past. Eminent historians and researchers on South India like Dr. J. F. Fleet, Dr. B. L. Rice, Dr. Jouveail Dubreuil, Sir John Marshall, Fred Goodwill, Prof. S. Krishnaswamy Aiyangar, T.A. Gopinath Rao, Mahamahopadhyaya R. Narasimhachar, V. Venkayya, H. Krishna Shastry, Dr. A. Venkatasubbiah, Dr. R. Shama Shastry, Prof. K.N. Shastry, Prof. B.M. Srikantaiah, T.T. Sharman and Dr. M.V. Krishna Rao were closely associated with the Mythic Society and many of their publications have appeared in the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society. The Society published a quarterly journal with academic articles written by peers. The list of council members of the society reveal that the Society had among its patrons Maharaja of Mysore and the Maharaja of Baroda. Rev. Fred Goodwill, one of the founding members of the Mystic Society, carried out research on behalf of the society on the early history of Kolar Gold Fields and Bangalore. His scholarly work on the 'Prison Song in Bangalore', based on the experiences of A Narrative of the Captivity and Sufferings of the Officers, Soldiers and Sepoys, who fell into the Hands of Hyder-Ali, after the Battle of Conjeveram (Kanchi), September 10, 1780, is acknowledged to be part of the history of Bangalore.

The breeding habitat is forest at altitudes between 400‚Äì1600 m, but the brown Violet-ear will spread widely into the lowlands when not nesting. It is replaced at higher altitudes by its relative, the lesser violetear (C. cyanotus), but their ranges overlap widely. The brown violetear is typically found high in the canopy of the rainforest, tall second growth and coffee plantations, but it will feed at lower levels at edges and clearings. The nest is a small cup of plant down saddled on a twig 1‚Äì3 m. high in a bush, into which two white eggs are laid. The 11.5 cm long, 6.5-7 g weight brown violetear is unmistakable; it is mainly dull brown, with a rufous rump and greyer underparts. There is a violet patch running back and down from the eye, a hermit-like malar stripe, and a glittering green and blue throat stripe. The bill is relatively short and almost straight. The female is similar to the male, but has a smaller throat patch. Immature bird have rufous fringes to the upperpart plumage, and little or no violet behind the eyes. The song is a vigorous repetition of the chit call, and is delivered by up to several dozen breeding males in loose leks. The brown violetear feeds on nectar from small flowers of trees and epiphytes. It also takes insects, often caught in flight (hawking), as an essential source of protein. Although not particularly territorial, this species is highly aggressive, and at feeders seems to spend far more time attacking other hummingbirds than actually feeding.

The McDonnell Douglas MD-83 struck trees and an instrument landing system (ILS) antenna during landing, causing $9 million in damage to the aircraft. Aircraft American Airlines Flight 1572 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois to Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut. On November 12, 1995, Flight 1572 was operated using a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, a twin-engine, narrow-body jet airliner (registration N566AA). The aircraft was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engines. The MD-83 had accumulated a total of 27,628 flight hours at the time of the accident. Flight history Flight 1572 was scheduled to depart from O'Hare at 21:25 Eastern Standard Time. However, because of bad weather and delayed connecting passengers, the flight was delayed and did not depart until 23:05. While en route to Hartford, the flight crew received an ACARS printout for the weather at Hartford. It noted an altimeter setting (reference atmospheric pressure) of , adding that pressure was falling rapidly in the area. The flight cruised uneventfully from Chicago to Hartford, other than changing from to to avoid reported turbulence. While on descent into Hartford, the pilots received a weather update at 00:30 that included a warning of wind shear and severe thunderstorms at Bradley. At 00:32, Flight 1572 was instructed by air traffic controllers to descend to . At 00:33, controllers advised Flight 1572 to descend to and advised the flight to use an altimeter setting of for Bradley. At 00:34, the first officer checked the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) automated weather broadcast for Hartford, and noted to the captain that the most recent ATIS broadcast was about 90 minutes old. For reasons unknown, the first officer entered on the altimeter causing it to read approximately high. The captain checked the aircraft's weather radar before beginning the non-precision approach to runway 15. Seeing no convective cells on the aircraft's path, he then turned the radar off. At 00:49, while Flight 1572 was beginning its final approach, the crew was advised that the control tower was closing temporarily due to severe weather buckling a window inside the cab. The tower supervisor remained behind to assist the flight. The captain noticed the autopilot was having difficulty maintaining altitude and heading in the buffeting winds. Five miles from the airport the aircraft encountered heavy rain and some turbulence. The flight continued descending to , the minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the approach. As the crew began to look for the airport, the aircraft continued descending. At 00:51, winds at Bradley were measured as 170¬∞ at , gusting to , with an altimeter setting of and falling rapidly. This information was not transmitted to the Bradley control tower until 00:57 and was not made available to the flight crew before landing. Crash At 00:55, the sink rate alarm went off, followed seconds later by a loud thump as the aircraft began shearing off treetops along Peak Mountain ridge. These trees were on a ridge with a ground elevation of , and the first treetop struck was at a height of . The captain advanced the throttles to full power, but the trees had been ingested into the engines causing them to flame out and shut down. The captain immediately lowered flaps to 40¬∞ hoping it would momentarily cause the aircraft to \\"balloon\\" upwards. While not standard operating procedure, this worked to a limited extent until the aircraft clipped a tree near the end of the runway. It then impacted the runway 33 ILS antenna equipment at the approach end of runway 15 before rolling to a stop. The accident resulted in one minor injury to a passenger; the other 72 passengers and all 5 crew members escaped without injury. The accident resulted in $9 million in damage to the aircraft and over $74,000 in damage to airport equipment. NTSB investigation The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident. The investigation cited several causes for this accident. It faulted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for designing the approach to runway 15 without taking the ridgeline into consideration. The new approach, which factors in the terrain, has increased the MDA to . However it cited pilot error as the primary cause due to an incorrect altimeter setting combined with the crew's failure to level off at the MDA. The report also noted since pressure was falling rapidly, the crew should have requested a more recent altimeter setting from the tower‚Äîthe ATIS broadcast is normally updated hourly or whenever weather conditions change, and the first officer had noted that the ATIS recording was over 90 minutes old. While turbulence, heavy rain and wind shear affected the aircraft, the crew continued to allow it to descend while searching for the airport. The cockpit voice recording of the incident became part of the script of a play called Charlie Victor Romeo. After the accident, N566AA was repaired and returned to service and continued to fly with American Airlines until being retired and stored in August 2017.

In 1964, Hornady began manufacturing rifle and pistol ammunition. The company is currently run by Joyce Hornady's son, Steve Hornady, who took over after his father's death in a plane crash on January 15, 1981. The Piper Aztec, with Hornady at the controls flying in heavy fog, crashed into Lake Pontchartrain while on final approach to New Orleans Lakefront Airport. Pacific Tool Company Steve Hornady worked for Pacific Tool Company from 1960 to 1971, from the time the company moved from California to Nebraska until Pacific Tool was bought by Hornady. Pacific's DL-366 was their final progressive press and Hornady's first, and it is still manufactured by Hornady as the 366 Auto. Products Hornady makes target shooting and hunting rounds as well as self-defense loads. In 1990, the Hornady XTP (which stands for Extreme Terminal Performance) won the industry's Product Award of Merit 1990 from the National Association of Federal Licensed Dealers. The company was the primary developer of the .17 HMR and .17 HM2 rimfire cartridges, increasingly popular for small game and vermin hunting. Hornady has worked closely with firearms maker Sturm, Ruger on the development of the new line of Ruger cartridges including the .480 Ruger, .204 Ruger, and .375 Ruger. The company developed the LEVERevolution ammunition, which uses a spitzer bullet with a soft elastomer tip to give better aerodynamic performance than flatter bullets, while eliminating the risk of a shock driving the pointed polymer tip of a bullet in a lever action rifle's tube magazine into the primer of the cartridge in front, causing an explosion. Hornady manufactures a range of handloading components including cartridge cases, bullets, and shotgun shell components, as well as handloading equipment and data. At the beginning of 2012, Hornady brought out a \\"Zombie Max\\" bullet, apparently due to the growing interest in \\"Zombie Shooting\\" in America. Hornady released the Vintage Match ammunition to replicate the original military performance specifications unique to wartime rifles such as the Mauser, Lee‚ÄìEnfield, Mosin‚ÄìNagant, Swedish Mauser or others chambered in 6.5√ó55mm, .303 British, 7.62√ó54mmR, 7.92√ó57mm Mauser and .30-06.

TDCC (Tables of Dimensions of Cartridges and Chambers) 300 PRC The .375 Ruger cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge (300 PRC), which is essentially a necked-down version of the .375 Ruger. The .375 Ruger cartridge case was used by Hornady as the basis for a new extra long range cartridge since it had the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with a neck and barrel throat optimized for loading relatively long and heavy .308 diameter very-low- drag bullets without the need to seat the bullets deeply recessed into the case result in adequate muzzle velocities from magnum sized bolt action rifles. Rifles chambered for the 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge must be capable of handling overall length cartridges. = 6.5 PRC = The 6.5 PRC, a variant or the .300 PRC, is a 6.5 millimeter cartridge first released around 2014. In similar fashion to the aforementioned cartridges, Hornady made small modifications to the design of the 6.5 Remington Magnum, which was released in 1963 and capitalized on the performance that Remington achieved by maximizing the efficiency of the cartridge. The only dissimilarity in the Hornady design is the absence of a belt on the cartridge.

It stars Barua himself as Devdas and Jamuna Barua as Parvati (Paro) and Chandrabati Devi as Chandramukhi. This was Barua's first of three language versions of the story, the second being in Hindi and the third in Assamese. The Bengali film was dubbed into Tamil and released in 1935. K. L. Saigal sang two songs in Tamil for this film.(See Ext. links for a link.) Sharat Chandra Chatterjee's classic novel Devdas is about two lovers - Debdas and Parbati - who can never unite as mortals because of the class system in the society. Sharat Chandra Chaterjee is believed to be in his teens when he wrote Devdas in 1901. But it was published in 1917. This classic masterpiece sensitively criticizes the feudalistic society that prevailed. Devdas novel was made more than 7 times in different languages. Apparently Devdas was received with great enthusiasm in every generation and any changing trend. All Indian prints of this Bengali version were destroyed decades ago in a fire that ravaged New Theatre‚Äôs studios. Currently, there is only one copy of the film which belongs to the Bangladesh Film Archives, of which almost 40 percent is destroyed. Plot Amar Mullick, Chandrabati Devi and Pramathesh Barua in a sequence of the film The son of Zamindar Narayan Mukherjee, Devdas was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He grew up in the lush village of Taj Sonapur, where he spent his childhood, indulged by his lovely playmate Paro. They grew up sharing a special relationship, in which they existed only to each other. Oblivious of all the differences of status and background, a bond that would never break grew between them. Slowly, it changed to love but it was still unsaid. But the reverie was broken when his family sent Devdas to Calcutta for education. Paro's world crashed knowing that her Devdas would be gone and she lit a diya, for it signified the fast coming back of her loved one. Years passed and Devdas returned. Devdas was besotted by her stunning beauty and longed to have her back. But Zamindar Narayan Mukherjee, Devdas' father, met Paro's mother Sumitra's marriage proposal with condescending arrogance. It caused a rift between the families and even though Devdas tried to convince his father, only antagonism came his way. Finally, he moved away from Paro and wrote a letter to her, asking her to forget him. Only, he didn't realize that he would never be able to forget her ever. And much later, when he reached out to her, it was too late as she was far too humiliated. She scorned him for not standing by her and they parted forever with a heart-broken Paro entering into a chaste marriage with a wealthy, much older man, Zamindar Bhuvan, while a shattered Devdas walked towards anguish, alcoholism & Chandramukhi. Chandramukhi, a stunning courtesan instantly lost her heart to Devdas. A unique bond was formed between both as he could share with her the intense pain of his unfulfilled love for Paro. Meanwhile, Paro, on the other hand, performed her worldly duties sincerely, but inside her heart, she could never forget Devdas for a moment. Strange was the fate of Devdas. Intensely loved by two women, who were never meant to be his. One whom he could never love and one whom he could never stop loving.

Rather than just translate one medium to another, PC Barua uses the novel as just raw material, creating his own structure and transforming what was purely verbal into an essentially visual form. Avoiding stereotypes and melodrama, Barua raises the film to a level of noble tragedy. The film's characters are not heroes and villains but ordinary people conditioned by a rigid and crumbling social system. Even the lead character Devdas has no heroic dimensions to his character. What we see are his weaknesses, his narcissism, his humanity as he is torn by driving passion and inner-conflict. The film is a complete departure from the then prevalent theatricality in acting, treatment and dialogue. Barua initiates a style of acting that is natural and unaffected. His method is to underplay, to convey emotion through the slightest tremor of the voice and use significant pauses in between the dialogue to maximum effect. This naturalness of tone spills over to the dialogue as well. Rather than dialogue in a florid style as was prevalent then, Barua who had been exposed to European naturalistic trends ensures the dialogue in the film is what one speaks in real life. A refreshing economy of style is visible throughout the film, whether establishing the love between Devdas and Parvati or conveying his anguish through the piercing sounds of the speeding train that takes him on his final tragic tryst with Parvati. The great physical distance that separates them and Devdas anxiety to redeem a promise is skillfully conveyed through some stunning use of parallel cutting. The sequence of Devdas crying out in delirium, Parvati stumbling and then Devdas falling from his berth in the train was commended for its essential 'Indianness' in conveying fate's domination over individual destiny. KL Saigal played Devdas in the Hindi version (Barua himself played the role in the Bengali version) and the film took him to cult star status. His songs in the film Balam Aaye Baso Mere Man Mein and Dukh ke Din Ab Beete Nahin became smash hits and set the tone for a glorious filmic career till his death in 1947. Saigal remains the prototype of Devdas till today, no mean feat considering screen giants such as Dilip Kumar, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Soumitra Chatterjee repeated the role later. Devdas has been remade a number of times, New Theatres remade it in Tamil in 1936, it was made twice in Telugu in 1953 and 1974 but the most famous subsequent version was the one by Bimal Roy who had photographed this version. The film, made in 1955, starred Dilip Kumar, Suchitra Sen and Vyjayanthimala as Devdas, Parvati and Chandramukhi respectively. The undercurrent of Devdas runs strong in the central character in both of Guru Dutt. Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a version of the film in 2002 with Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in the three lead roles. Box office and ratings Devdas (1935), produced by New Theatres is an all-time hit. It made Pramathesh Chandra Barua (1903‚Äì1951) a star overnight and revolutionalised the concept of cinema as entertainment into cinema of social concern and literature expressed through celluloid. Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, a then-frequent visitor at the New Theatres studio in south Calcutta, told Barua after seeing Devdas, \\"It appears that I was born to write Devdas because you were born to recreate it in cinema.\\" It was a rare tribute from a writer to the actor-director of a film based on his story. Over time, the character of Devdas became synonymous with the name of PC Barua. Till today, the image of PC Barua the man is inseparable from the image of Devdas, the character he played. Reviews and critiques Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay (1876‚Äì1938) wrote Devdas in 1901 when he was 25. But he could not find a publisher till 1917. Sarat Chandra was sympathetic to the woman - repressed at home and tortured outside. He was partial to those who, for no fault of theirs, incurred the disapproval or displeasure of the family or community. The social and domestic atmosphere in Sarat Chandra's works does not exist any more. But the story interest keeps the reader hooked, irrespective of the plausibility or otherwise of the narrative. His stories were extremely ‚Äòfilmogenic‚Äô and therefore, novels like Parineeta (1914), Biraj Bou (1914) and Palli Samaj (1916), appear as topical to the Indian filmmaker as stories written by contemporary writers. Translated in many Indian languages, Devdas continues to be Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's most successful and controversial novel. The climax of the film was Pramathesh's original contribution to the story because Sarat Chandra had written it differently. Had Devdas the film, ended the way the novel did, the audience might not have understood it. Barua decided that when Parvati would hear that her Devdas was dying under a tree outside her house, she would run out to see him. But as she would rush out, the doors would begin to close on her. This door is a metaphor for the social taboo against a married woman rushing out to see her former lover, crossing the threshold of her marital home. It was unthinkable in those days. \\"Barua conceptualised this entire scene. It was not there in the novel. When Sarat Babu saw the film, he was so moved that he told Barua that even he had never thought of ending the novel the way Barua had done,\\" informed Jamuna Barua. Sarat Babu went on to tell Pramathesh that this actor's entry into films was solely to give life to Devdas, the character he had created through the written word. Devdas turned into a folk hero for all time. Pramathesh metamorphosed into a cultural icon of his time since he directed and brought to life the Devdas character. Yet, the story goes that Pramathesh was under severe mental stress during the making of this film because he was still coping with his grief over the death of Kshiti (Amala Devi) who had died before he began to make the film. The script of Devdas was being written while Pramathesh was already shooting Rooprekha. After finishing the casting, Pramathesh discovered that he had not found the Parvati he was looking for. Kanan Devi was approached but she had to decline because she was already under contract with Radha Films. He then chanced upon Jamuna, sister of Sitara and Jaya Gupta of Varanasi, who was chosen to portray Parvati. Sometime during the making of the film, the reel-love story turned into a love story in real life. Pramathesh married Jamuna. As soon as work on Devdas was complete, Jamuna gave birth to their son who, to rhyme with the film that brought the lovers together, was christened Debkumar. Devdas was released in Chitra Talkies on 26 April 1935. There are several scenes in Devdas that marked the entry of the jump cut to heighten the drama through a new editing strategy. When Devdas vomits blood during his travels, the camera cuts in to show a plate of floral offerings fall off Parvati's hands, far away in her matrimonial home. In a night scene on the train, as soon as Devdas calls out to Paro, the scene cuts once again to show the doors and windows burst open in Parvati's room as Parvati screams out in sleep in the middle of a nightmare. These scenes set out Pramathesh's creative imagination in explaining through the language of cinema the psychological stress his characters were reeling under, as also the telepathic bonding the lovers shared, without reducing these to melodrama or using sentimental dialogue. According to the late Phani Majumdar, Pramathesh's best performance is in Devdas. He describes, in particular, the scene where Devdas, after his beloved Parvati has been married to another, wanders aimlessly, drinking and shooting down birds at random. A friend of Parvati who spots him from a distance while carrying a pot of water back home, is scared to cross his path. But Devdas merely comes close to the girl and asks her how she is, thus building a scene to an unpredictable anti-climax in a film spilling over with dramatic twists and turns and human tragedy. This is an example of how Pramathesh had gained both command and control over the medium of cinema. As an actor, Pramathesh abhorred melodrama. He kept his face almost deadpan, used minimum body language and left it to his audience to read from his emotions and from the total mise-en-scene. Barua did not create Devdas - he was Devdas. So powerful was the impact of Pramathesh's portrayal on screen, so close it grew to his private life, that to the Bengali audience, Devdas was synonymous with the actor who played the character. By the time the film was released, Pramathesh became aware that he had contacted tuberculosis, and, drawn inescapably to the bottle like his screen parallel, wasted himself away slowly and surely, to die barely 15 years after he had lived the character of Devdas on screen. The social relevance of Devdas lies in the fact that it was the first film to place on celluloid the social ramifications of a man of high birth who moves away from his feudal, upper-class roots in rural Bengal to the colonial city of Calcutta during pre-World War II years. It tried to explore the inner pain of this man, torn between the pull he feels towards his village roots and his wish to run away to the city to escape from the tragic reality of a lost love. His wilful manner of moving towards self-destruction could be read as his casual indifference to the village that he once belonged to, a village he now responds to with mixed feelings. Before his death, he tries in vain to run away from an anonymous death in the unfeeling city by coming back to the village in one last desperate attempt to renew his lost ties. The harsh, heartless reality of the city has changed his perspective towards the village. He finally rejects the tempting illusions and fantasies the city once held for him. The city loses Devdas but the village too refuses to accept him even in his ignominious, humiliating death. Only two women - Parvati and Chandramu- khi - who operate like invisible, unwritten ‚Äòguardians of conscience‚Äô in the wreckage his life is reduced to, are left to grieve over his death. For Parvati, Devdas symbolises the adorable rebel from a feudal family who breaks rules only to come back to them in the end, proving that he is no rebel after all. For Chandramukhi, Devdas represents the generosity that characterises a prince who wills himself to self-destruction through excess. Devdas failed to offer social respectability to the two women in his life. Somewhere down the line, the audience forgot to draw the line between the Devdas they saw on screen and Pramathesh Barua, the real man who was merely playing out a role. Never before or since, has any screen character meshed so completely, so seamlessly and so ideally with the actor who brought the character to life on celluloid. Stylistically, Pramathesh adopted a refreshing economy throughout the film. \\"The film was a complete departure from the then- prevalent theatricality in acting, treatment and dialogue. Barua initiated a style of acting which was natural and unaffected; his method was to underplay, to convey emotion through the slightest tremor of the voice and use significant pauses between the dialogue to telling effect. The dialogue too, was simple, everyday speech, without dramatic flamboyance or literary flourish. The slow, soft and cleverly modulated dialogue became a hallmark not only of Barua‚Äôs but all of New Theatres‚Äô films.\\" The Indian movie world was adorned with some excellent productions by Pramathesh Barua. But, his most celebrated work is Devdas. He played the title role in it, where the other stars were Biswanath Bhaduri, Uma Shashi, Kundan Saigal and Chandrabati. Raichand Boral was the music director. The story of Devdas was based on the novel of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhya of the same title. The novelist was so deeply moved by the film that tears rolled down his eyes and he opined that PC Barua‚Äôs Devdas was more distinctive than the Devdas of his own novel. Noted film critic Chidananda Das Gupta made a significant remark ‚Äî \\"Pramathesh Barua did not merely make Devdas, but also came to be widely known as ‚ÄòDevdas‚Äô rather than a Rajkumar (prince) ... His Devdas is a milestone in the film world of the subcontinent\\". Awards Social and cultural impact Political and social influence The Directorate of Film Festivals had to borrow a copy of India's first film version of this from the Bangladesh High Commission in order to screen it during the Devdas retrospective here on Delhi on Oct 2002 at Delhi Film Festival. The film was sent through diplomatic bag by the Bangladesh government and the screening was conducted under strict vigil, no video clips, no photographs, no extracts on television ‚Äî as the copyright belongs to the Bangladesh Film Archives. The film was screened to a full auditorium. The copyright of the film actually belongs to the New Theatre. The Indian prints of P.C. Barua‚Äôs Bengali version of the film, with Barua playing Devdas, were destroyed decades ago in a fire that ravaged New Theatre's studios. Currently, there is only one copy of the film which belongs to the Bangladesh Film Archives. And that too is with almost 40 percent of it destroyed. This version, which was screened here after a long gap, retained only parts of the classic and had very poor sound quality. P.K Nair, Director, Film Archives, says the Archives traced the presence of the copy in the 1970s and requested the Bangladesh Film Archives to allow India to restore the film and make a copy of it. But that's not the only missing classic from India's repertoire, says Nair. According to him, the Archives has traced a number of copies of Indian classic of the 1930s and 1940s in countries like Pakistan, Algeria and many more. And these are copies of films which can no longer be found in India. Almost 70 percent of the films made before the 1950s will not be available any more.

In addition to his other specific contributions as a Jugantar leader, he holds the record of a hunger strike for 78 days in Bilaspur Jail in December 1917. Early days He was born on 8 October 1892, in the village Thakurpur in Jessore, now in Bangladesh. His father Kailash Chandra Datta was the manager of the nearby Parchar estates in Faridpur. His mother Bimalasundari was a charitable woman who brought up her children Bhupen, Kamalini, Jadugopal, Snehalata and Suprabha in a God-loving atmosphere. While reading the Ramayana, one day young Bhupen learned that the heroic Lakshmana owed his mom to his control of impulses (brahmacharya). Having asked his mother what it meant, he declared that he would follow brahmachmom, which he did throughout his life of a bachelor, dedicated to the service of fellow creatures. He joined Anushilan Samiti in his Faridpur Government High School days, drawn by its humanitarian activities and its anti-Partition agitations since 1905. The study of the Bhagavad Gita and of works by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Vivekananda opened before him the path he wanted to follow. Daulatpur College After joining the Scottish Church College of Kolkata, in 1911, Bhupen came across two significant members of the initial Anushilan Samiti of Kolkata, who introduced him to Sachin Sanyal from Benares, who was desirous to join an active revolutionary party. His prior release from the Howrah Trial and informed him about a forthcoming World War. During this time, Jatindranath Mukherjee or Bagha Jatin had suspended all violent activity, preparing for an armed insurrection all over India.agniyug o biplabi bhupendrakumar datta by Samyukta Mitra, Sahitya Samsad, 1995, pp38-39. Discouraged at the suspension of all revolutionary activities, Sachin went to the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti whose leaders did not participate in Bagha Jatin's programme. Led by a faint clue in 1913, Bhupen decided to go to Khulna and join the Daulatpur Hindu Academy. Encouraged by the liberal spirit reigning in the campus, Bhupen brought together his own group of college-mates interested in social work, raising funds for the poor by offering manual labour, gymnastics, study sessions for the Gita and essays of contemporary thinkers. They founded their own hostel. Several professors of the college and the superintendent himself, like for example Shashibhushan Raychaudhury (or more commonly known by his nickname) \\"Shashida\\", who was more famous for his experiments in education, and had been closely associated with Bagha Jatin, used to visit the College. Introduced by Shashida, after a number of contacts, Bhupen recognised in Bagha Jatin the leader he was waiting for. Invited by his friend Hemanta Kumar Sarkar, Bhupen went to Krishnagar and spent a few days in the company of Subhas Chandra Bose, the future \\"Netaji\\". Contrary to his habit, during a conversation, Bhupen disclosed to the friends his meeting with Bagha Jatin and informed them that he sensed that there was a big revolutionary preparation going on under Jatin's guidance. Subhash listened to all this and, moved up to his core, retired without dinner. He had a conviction that one had to be a \\"liberated soul\\" (mukta-purush) in order to lead a revolution and, the next day, asked Bhupen point blank, \\"Is Jatin Mukherjee a mukta-purush?\\" Bhupen told him that he had no idea of what a mukta-purush was, but there was a man who not only quoted the Gita but whose very life was an embodiment of the teachings of the Gita.Samyukta, pp67-68 Drawn by the relief work organised by the revolutionaries in August‚ÄìSeptember 1913, in collaboration with the Ramakrishna Mission during the flood on the Damodar in the districts of Burdwan, Midnapore and Hooghli, Bhupen met there some of the stalwart collaborators of Jatin Mukherjee. Arun Chandra Guha wrote: \\"The police had somehow got information that behind the facade of relief work, Jatin and other workers were forging a powerful revolutionary organisation\\". Bhupen was to know later that during the flood relief, at Kalinagar in Medinipur, Atulkrishna Ghosh, Amarendra Chatterjee, Jadugopal Mukherjee and others brought together, under the moral and spiritual caution of Bagha Jatin, the various branches and sub-groups of the secret societies in order to create the rising Jugantar, which was more a concerted movement than a party.Samyukta, p4 After returning to Daulatpur, Bhupen learnt from his college mate Gopaldas Majumdar that Bagha Jatin was soon leaving his business as a contractor in order to go back to Kolkata.smaran-baran, 1981, pp38-41 After a significant farewell visit to Bhupen, Jatin sent a horse to Dr Amulya Ukil of the campus, apparently for the latter's use; thanks to this gift, Bhupen and the other boys took lessons in riding.Samyukta, pp68-69 Assisted by Bhupen, Dr Ukil in earnest discipline took to training the students in military drill, semaphore signaling, arms collection, propaganda among military police and the fluvial workers of Khulna-Jessore regions. On visit to Daulatpur, Subhas Chandra Bose and Hemanta Kumar Sarkar were so impressed by this pageant that during the Kolkata session of the National Congress, in 1928, when Bose organised the Bengal Volunteers in a fully military style, he was happy to have Bhupen by his side.Samyukta, p69Bhupendra Kumar Datta in Dictionary of National Biography, Vol.I, p383 On visiting India after forty- two years, Dr. Tarak Nath Das reminded in his tribute to Bagha Jatin : \\"In Jatinda‚Äôs method of working there was a military discipline (‚Ä¶) Throughout the country, inspired by Jatinda's ideology, one has to create an organisation similar to the military model. That alone will be an adequate homage to Jatinda.\\" Anandabazar Patrika, 10 September 1952. Kolkata again In spite of such a hectic social programme, in March 1915 Bhupen passed his Intermediate Examination securing very high marks, with distinctions for the quality of his Bengali and English prose. Although he joined the Sanskrit College of Kolkata, he attended (along with Subhash Bose) courses in philosophy at the Presidency College. For students coming from the districts, Bhupen opened a hostel which counted among its inmates brilliant students like Meghnad Saha, Sisir Mitra, Sailen Ghosh, Jatin Seth, Jnan Mukherjee, Jnan Ghosh, all of them known to Bagha Jatin and Shashida, all of them more or less involved in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy. Similar other hostels were run by his revolutionary associates, out of which the Eden Hindu Hostel was to become a permanent reference for years to come. Bagha Jatin was a frequent visitor to these addresses which sheltered a number of future celebrities.Samyukta, pp 74-75 In September 1915, after the self-undoing of Bagha Jatin, massive repression and imprisonment prevailed in India. Stunned by the leader's sudden death, whereas his top-ranking associates felt helpless and absconded, Bhupen stepped forward to remind them that a revolution could not die with the leader's death: \\"Bhupendra Kumar Datta remained the sole moving worker to maintain the links and collect money,\\" admitted Arun Chandra Guha. He was assisted by Charu Ghosh and Kuntal Chakravarti. His role was similar to that of Bagha Jatin during the Alipore trial in 1908-09. According to Jadugopal Mukherjee, \\"In 1917 Bhupen occupied a special place among our leading figures.\\"Biplabi jibaner smriti, 2nd ed, p380. On 17 May 1917, he was arrested. On the eve of the visit to India of Edwin Samuel Montagu, Secretary of State for India in the British Cabinet, information came that the Government did not want to discuss with the Minister the fate of those accused of any implication in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy. Immediately, the Jugantar group, then led by Jibanlal Chatterjee, published its declaration in December 1917: \\"But first and last, spread terror. Make this unholy Government impossible. Hide like invisible shadows of doom and rain death upon the alien bureaucracy. Remember your brothers who are perishing in jails and rotting in swamps. Remember those who have died or have gone mad. Remember, watch and work.\\"Rowlatt, ¬ß98 Protesting against the imprisonment of such a number of people without habeas corpus and against the physical and moral torture meted inside the prisons, an eight-page long appeal was written by Jiten Lahiri and Bhupendra Kumar Datta; it was sent to forty-two important personalities to inform the countrymen about the decision of a hunger strike taken by the political prisoners all over India. Transferred to Bilaspur Jail, Bhupen \\"continued his hunger strike for 78 days, till then the longest ever period of hunger strike in any country\\".Dictionary of National Biography, p383 The Jugantar and Gandhi Released in 1920, sensing that Gandhi rode the revolutionary tide, as a mouthpiece of the Jugantar, Bhupen wanted to expedite the tempo of the non-cooperation movement and met Mohandas K. Gandhi at the Nagpur session of the Congress Party. Having the latter's promise that, if the people responded well, he would convert the Party into free India's Republican Parliament, Bhupen went to Pondicherry to consult Sri Aurobindo about the future of the Jugantar. Diffident about Gandhi's expectation to win freedom within one year, Sri Aurobindo recognised that Gandhi represented a tremendous force and it would be unwise to resist him; the former advised the revolutionaries to collaborate without, however, making of non-violence a fetish, sticking to their own ethics. After Gandhi's failure, the Jugantar sided Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das in his Swarajya programme as an antidote: by observing overtly, all over India, the eighth anniversary of Bagha Jatin's death, on 9 September 1923, they intimated their intention to follow their own conviction. Deshabandhu proposed to visit the spot where Bagha Jatin fought and to raise there a memorial.Bhupendra Kumar Datta. Biplaber padachinha Ed.2nd, p156. Arrested again on 23 September 1923, Bhupen was deported to Mandalay in Burma, where Subhash Bose was to join him soon after and offer him Memories of a Revolutionist by Kropotkin that he had smuggled for Bhupen during his last trip to Europe.Source: Samyukta, p125. Even inside his solitary prison cell, Bhupen was contacted by some Burmese as well as a few Bengali revolutionaries absconding in Burma and, thanks to his guidance, they formed an important organisation with branches all over the country; they, along with their leader Jiten Ghosh, were arrested only in 1931, during the Burmese revolt.Itih√¢s√© up√©kshita, by Utphulla R√¢y, quoted by Samyukta, p128. Released in 1928, Bhupen resumed his usual multifarious role of maintaining contacts with various Jugantar leaders from Surya Sen in Chittagong to Bhagat Singh in Punjab (who had been in constant touch with Bhupen since 1923), editing the party organ Swadhinata, making bombs, collecting arms and distributing them, looking after the volunteer movement. Busy sheltering the absconding revolutionaries of the Chittagong Armoury Raid, Bhupen was arrested again in 1930, for a period of eight years. During 1938-41 and 1946-51 he edited the weekly Forward : his editorials were read with interest by patriots of all political trends. In 1946 his collection of essays, Indian Revolution and the Constructive Programme appeared with a foreword by Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first president of future independent India. In the meantime, in 1941, Bhupen was again detained till 1946. Interlude in Pakistan Feverish attempt to rescue victims of communal riots in Kolkata and of the partition of India led him to be elected as an M.P. in Pakistan, before serving as an M.L.A. Among several reports of his action, it was learnt that on 7 March 1949 when Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, while claiming support from Quaid-i-Azam declared before the Constituent Assembly that Pakistan was founded with the Muslims‚Äô wish to live the teachings and the tradition of Islam, one of the members, Birat Chandra Mondal reminded that Muhammad Ali Jinnah had \\"unequivocally said that Pakistan will be a secular State.\\" Bhupendra Kumar Datta went a step further by commenting the PM's statement : \\"...were this resolution to come before this house within the life-time of (...) the Quaid- i-Azam, it would not have come in its present shape.\\".The First Islamic Republic According to Dr M. Waheeduzzaman Manik, after Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah‚Äôs protest against imposing of Urdu as the lingua franca of Pakistan (published in daily Azad on 29 July 1947), on 25 February 1948, member Dhirendranath Datta demanded Bengali instead (spoken by 55% of the citizens), Members Bhupendra Kumar Datta, Prem Hari Barma and Srish Chandra Chattopadhyay \\"wholeheartedly supported Dhiren Datta‚Äôs historic amendment and vehemently defended the rightful place of Bengali.\\" On 28 March 1971, at the onset of Bangladesh Liberation War, Pakistani military junta tortured Dhirendranath Datta to death in Comilla.Rash B. Ghosh, History of Language Day Even in the opposition, Bhupen enjoyed the admiration of the ruling party. Khawaja Nazimuddin, Prime Minister (1951‚Äì53), speaking of Bhupen, once exclaimed : \\"He knows how to plan, organise and execute.\\".Samyukta, p157 His articles in the Ittefaq drew the attention of the intelligentsia in the then East Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was particularly proud to have known Bhupenda. Return to India Immobilised by the Martial Law in 1958, Bhupen waited in vain for four years to renew his activity in Pakistan. In 1962, he bade good bye to Pakistan and to politics, and went back to India, sharing his time between Kolkata and New Delhi. During his absence, on 9 September 1947, an imposing Bagha Jatin memorial week was observed in West Bengal, and the former Jugantar members had chosen Bhupen for writing an authentic biography of their leader. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of a young researcher, Bhupen passed on to him the lifelong notes and reflections he had accumulated, accompanied him to interview most of the important associates of Bagha Jatin and opened before him the access to the archives in India. His approach to history His first-hand knowledge of events was of a great lesson in historical research : while comparing oral statements with files in the archives and, at times before apparent contradictions, his spirit of synthesis and intuition helped to determine their complementary character. When the pupil completed the first draft, Bhupen revised it minutely and, whilst the biography was being serialised, he went on adding further comments. In addition to his regular contributions in Bengali and English periodicals, Bhupen issued an obituary pamphlet on his erstwhile colleagues, as was needed. In spite of a seriously failing eyesight, this \\"engaged spectator\\" entertained a ministerial correspondence with people he was associated with. A tribute \\"Simple, unostentatious but erudite, Bhupendrakumar, with his well-built physique, serious but candid countenance, sparkling eyes and friendly smile, impresses one as an ascetic missionary mellowed by love for man. He is a firm believer in reason, science and progress, and has no patience with casteism, regionalism and communalism, nor with institutional religion that creates isolation and alienation,\\" wrote Kamala Das Gupta.Dictionary of National Biography, Vol.I, p384 Bhupendrakumar guided three generations of Indian thinkers and activists. Having celebrated the centenary of Bagha Jatin's birth, he died quietly in Kolkata, on 29 December 1979.

He attended the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow and earned a diploma in financial economy in 1982. From 1981 to 1982, he also attended the Evening University for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. After that, Amarjargal worked at the Central Committee of Mongolian Trade Union. He taught at Military Institute from 1983 to 1990 and at Technical University from 1990 to 1991. He worked as a director of the Economic College of Mongolia from 1991 to 1996. From 1994 to 1995, he studied at the University of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, and graduated with a Master of Science in Macroeconomic Policy and Planning. During his state visit in England in March 2000, the university granted him an honorary doctorate. In 2003, Amarjargal was a visiting research fellow at the Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University in Japan.  Political career  Amarjargal contributed to the democratic movement in Mongolia from the beginning. He was a founding member of the New Progress-Union and the National Progress-Party. Then he helped to merge those with several other parties to form the National Democratic Party (MNDP, Mongolyin √úndesniy Ardchilsan Nam). As per the latter, he was elected to State Great Khural (the parliament) in 1996. In April 1998, he became a foreign minister under Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. In September of the same year he nearly became a prime minister, according to an agreement between the governing coalition and the President, but he was rejected by the Parliament in a close vote. He then remained as the foreign minister until Elbegdorj's government had to step back in December. In 1999, Amarjargal became a chairman of MNDP. He was finally designated as the Prime Minister of Mongolia on July 30 of the same year. He stayed in office for almost a year until July 26, 2000, when the democratic parties were beaten at the parliamentary elections. While holding office, he had to abandon his seat at the parliament, because of a Constitutional clause still in force at that time. Also in the year 2000 MNDP and Social Democratic Party merged to form Democratic Party. In 2004, Amarjargal was elected to the parliament as an independent candidate. Amarjargal has voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.  Amarjargal Foundation  In 2001, Amarjargal established Amarjargal Foundation. This is an NGO which promotes a transparent and open society, and carries out studies on social welfare, economy, politics, and law. It also negotiates foreign help and investment.

While they were inspired by another Slovenian radical band Buldo≈æer known for utilizing sheer madness in the social and political satire, their lyrics is more self-ironic. The band was formed in Maribor in June 1979. Their name, meaning hungry Franz, is a pun on the name of a character from the novel Catch-22, Hungry Joe, and describes hunger for rock music. The band's music and attitude was a kind of laid back, and they portrayed themselves as a local band from a provincial town. Zoran Predin's lyrics ranged from disturbing ballads (Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, Lipa zelenela je), through love songs (ƒåakaj me, Naj ti poljub nari≈°e ustnice), to social and political satire (Praslovan, Na≈°a Lidija je pri vojakih). The key band members were frontman and songwriter Zoran Predin, and guitarist Oto Rimele. The band made the most creative success by the end of the 1980s, with classical albums such as Ikebana, Adijo pamet, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, and Na svoji strani (the last one made with the original crew). Their last studio album was released in 1994. Laƒçni Franz officially ceased to exist in 1997 after a series of compilation albums. Zoran Predin continued solo career after the Franz disbanded. Many band's hits, such as Praslovan, Bog nima telefona, Vaterpolist, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, ƒåakaj me or Naj ti poljub nari≈°e ustnice, have remained in his concert repertoire.

Founded in 1890, the magazine has dedicated itself throughout its existence to providing students an outlet for intellectual and political discussion, literary publication, and general parody. (Another magazine with a similar name, exists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Journalism and Mass Communications). History Founded in 1890, the magazine disbanded for unknown reasons in 1893. It was not until 1998 that a handful of undergraduates revived the journal based on the original format. The staff has since grown to several dozen writers and contributors. In switching to a monthly in 2005, the magazine affirmed its place as a campus fixture. Recently, the magazine has begun to focus more on pieces of \\"hard\\" journalism, in contradistinction to its former, less serious, and more literary character. The Blue and White staff meets in the crypt of St. Paul's Chapel. Bwog In 2006, The Blue and White established Bwog, an online blog counterpart to the magazine. Bwog aims to bring its readership gossip and other Columbia news around the clock. It first gained national recognition for its coverage of a violent protest against the Minutemen illegal immigration group that occurred at Columbia in 2006 and for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial visit to the university in 2007. Years later, in December 2010, Bwog gained national media attention again for its reactive coverage of Operation Ivy League, a notorious campus drug bust.

A bishop says \\"Pax vobis\\" (\\"Peace to you\\") instead. Accent marks are supplied to indicate the stress. Dominus vobiscum (Latin: \\"The Lord be with you\\") is an ancient salutation and blessing traditionally used by the clergy in the Catholic Mass and other liturgies, as well as liturgies of other Western Christian denominations, such as Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Methodism. Usage The response is Et cum spiritu tuo, meaning \\"And with your spirit.\\" Some English translations, such as Divine Worship: The Missal and the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, translate the response in the older form, \\"And with thy spirit.\\" Eastern Orthodox churches also follow this usage, although the episcopal and presbyteral blessing are one and the same; in Greek, Œï·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑ œÄ·æ∂œÉŒπ, eirene pasi, \\"peace to all.\\" In the Roman Rite, this usage is only for the bishop, who says Pax vobiscum. The ICEL translation presently in use for Roman Catholic Masses in English has \\"And with your spirit.\\" Prior to Advent 2011, the Roman Catholic response in English-speaking countries was \\"And also with you.\\" In 2001 the Holy See issued the instruction Liturgiam Authenticam concerning the use of vernacular languages in the Mass. The instruction requires that certain phrases, such as the response Et cum spiritu tuo, which \\"belong to the heritage of the whole or of a great part of the ancient Church, as well as others that have become part of the general human patrimony, are to be respected by a translation that is as literal as possible\\".Liturgiam Authenticam (English tr.) ¬∂ 56. Accordingly, the current translation of the Mass in English uses the response \\"And with your spirit\\" to reflect an accurate translation of the Latin.United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Sample Text: Changes in the People's Parts. Dominus vobiscum is not usually said by anyone who is not at least a deacon. If introducing a prayer, it is otherwise replaced with Domine, exaudi orationem meam with the response Et clamor meus ad te veniat (\\"O Lord, hear my prayer\\", \\"And let my cry come to thee\\", the opening verse of Psalm 101) or, if that invocation is said in any case, it is omitted. This exchange is also said in the Lutheran Divine Service. The Lutheran Book of Worship, released in 1978, used the phrase \\"And also with you.\\" The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's updated hymnal, Evangelical Lutheran Worship, retains this wording. The response in the Lutheran Service Book, used by the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìCanada (LCC), was changed to \\"And with your spirit\\" in 2006, changing from \\"thy\\" to \\"your\\". In some Jewish rites, a person called up to the Torah says Adonai immachem; the sense is identical.Book of Prayer of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' Congregation, London vol. 1, page 47. Origins The salutation is taken from the verses and in the Vulgate, the Latin translation of the Bible. In Ruth, the phrase appears in the sentence, \\"Et ecce ipse veniebat de Bethlehem dixitque messoribus: 'Dominus vobiscum'. Qui responderunt ei: 'Benedicat tibi Dominus'.\\" (\\"Boaz himself came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, 'The Lord be with you!' and they replied, 'The Lord bless you!'\\").The Latin here is taken from the Nova Vulgata (source ), and the English from the New American Bible (source ). II Chronicles recounts that Azariah, filled with the spirit of God, said, \\"Audite me, Asa et omnis Iuda et Beniamin! Dominus vobiscum, quia fuistis cum eo. Si quaesieritis eum, invenietur a vobis; si autem dereliqueritis eum, derelinquet vos.\\" (\\"Hear me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin! The LORD is with you when you are with him, and if you seek him he will be present to you; but if you abandon him, he will abandon you.\\")Source: Latin , English. The phrase additionally appears in : \\"Nolite ascendere: non enim est Dominus vobiscum: ne corruatis coram inimicis vestris.\\"The New American Bible translates the verse, \\"Do not go up, because the Lord is not in your midst; if you go, you will be beaten down before your enemies.\\" (Source .) (Hebrew Ayn adonai b'qirb'chem) The expression in Hebrew means to be successful. It also occurs in where Saul tells David \\"Go and may the Lord be with you\\" (Lech va'adonai y'hiyeh im'cha).

Like the other Norwegian gunships of her era, she carried a reasonable heavy armament on a diminutive hull. A distinct feature of Ellida was that her funnel could be raised and lowered as needed. The vessel was built at the Naval Yard at Horten, and had yard number 59. It is unclear from the sources if the listed armament is the original armament, or if Ellida originally was armed with a much heavier main gun like the slightly older 1. class gunboat Sleipner. Ellida, like Sleipner, carried an underwater torpedo tube in her bow for firing Whitehead torpedoes, and she was the second vessel in the Royal Norwegian Navy equipped with this weapon. Ellida in Horten in 1903 Ellida underwent a refit in 1896, and was reclassified as a steam corvette. From 1898 she was used as a training vessel for cadets.

She distinguished herself both in reporting and editorial writing, advocating for justice for African Americans in the county and the state. In 1964 Smith was the first woman to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing, largely for her writing about the Civil Rights Movement in the year of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. She received numerous other awards for her work as a publisher and editor. A lifelong Baptist, Smith described herself as \\"just a little editor in a little spot. A lot of other little editors in a lot of little spots is what helps make this country. It's either going to help protect that freedom that we have, or else it's going to let that freedom slip away by default.\\" Biography Hazel Freeman Brannon was born in 1914 in Alabama City, Alabama. She attended local schools and was raised a Baptist by her parents. In 1930, she graduated at the age of 16 from high school in Gadsden. She showed an early interest in journalism, working on a local paper before college. She attended the University of Alabama and graduated in 1935 with a B.A. in Journalism. After graduation, she went to Durant, Mississippi and bought the failing Durant News of Holmes County. This majority-black county, long dominated by agriculture, was bordered on the west by the Yazoo River and was part of the Mississippi Delta. By 1943 she had turned the Durant paper around. She bought another weekly, The Lexington Advertiser, based in the nearby county seat of Lexington, where she lived. It was the second oldest newspaper in the state. She edited and published the Lexington Advertiser, the major newspaper in Holmes County, for four decades from 1943 to 1985.Jeffrey B. Howell, Hazel Brannon Smith: The Female Crusading Scalawag (2017) ch 1 In 1956, Smith acquired the Banner County Outlook (Flora, Mississippi) and the Northside Reporter (Jackson, Mississippi), the latter based in the state capital. In 1950 she married Walter Dyer Smith, known as \\"Smitty\\", whom she had met on an around-the-world cruise. He was working as the ship's purser. He settled with her in Holmes County and became a county hospital administrator. Reporting the facts and writing editorials Smith became known for her editorials and her column (\\"Through Hazel's Eyes\\"), which focused on unpopular causes, political corruption, and social injustice in Mississippi, particularly Holmes County. This agricultural county of 27,000 had a majority-black population, many of whom were poor. As early as April 1943, she indicated her independence by a feature front-page story in her Durant paper about an African-American civic group that donated money to the local Red Cross. Most newspapers at the time reported on African Americans only when they were involved in crimes. Smith was a woman of the South and had absorbed many of its mores. But she wrote in support of a county venereal disease clinic, and encouraged law enforcement to act against illegal bootlegging and gambling. She initially wrote against the United States Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), saying the races preferred separation, and that southern states needed to work on their own solutions. In 1954 Smith attracted attention for her reporting of the sheriff shooting Harry Randall in the leg, after a confrontation in which he told the man to get moving. Smith criticized Sheriff Richard Byrd for harassing a black resident and called for his resignation. He filed a libel suit against her, winning in the lower court, but a state court of appeals overturned the verdict against her. After 1954 Smith no longer supported segregation in her editorials. She became known for her truthful reporting and sympathy for justice for African Americans. Gradually she began to express a progressive position, editorializing in favor of the civil rights movement and against activities of the White Citizens Council.Howell, Hazel Brannon Smith Following the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, White Citizens' Council were established across the state, especially in black-majority counties, to oppose school desegregation. The state also established the taxpayer-funded Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, ostensibly to promote and market the state. But it established a secret police arm that conducted surveillance of private citizens, made lists of suspected activists, and made these available to private groups to conduct suppression of civil rights activism. Smith's editorials and fair reporting attracted the wrath of local and eventually state segregationists. In 1956 the Citizens' Council of Holmes County forced the firing of her husband Walter B. Smith from his position as county hospital administrator, affecting their economic stability. This was the kind of economic blackmail being used against civil rights activists across the state: African Americans were fired for being members of the NAACP, others were evicted from rental housing, and some businesses were boycotted in an effort to suppress activism. In 1959 the Citizens' Council in Holmes County started the Holmes County Herald to compete with Smith's newspaper The Lexington Advertiser. In 1960, Smith received the Elijah P. Lovejoy Award for Courage in Journalism from the International Conference of Weekly Newspaper Editors and Southern Illinois University. On Halloween 1960, an eight-foot tall cross was burned on the lawn of her home. While this was a sign of the Ku Klux Klan, she attributed the incident to teenagers having learned hate from their parents.Carol Nunnelly, \\"Hazel Brannon Smith\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, 2008; updated 2018 Beginning in 1961, Smith faced an outright economic boycott on advertising, as the White Citizens Council increased its opposition after learning that she was printing jobs for African-American activists. But Smith attracted support among other newspaper publishers, such as Hodding Carter, Jr. of Greenville, Mississippi. In 1961 he organized a committee to raise money to help her. In December 1961, Smith began to print the Mississippi Free Press, founded by activists in an effort to get their news out to the African-American community in the state. Most white-owned newspapers carried only negative coverage of their efforts, if any. Smith later undertook other printing jobs for African-American customers: the monthly Baptist Observer and books for the black Baptist Convention. These jobs helped support her newspaper. She also hired blacks to work in the printing plant and became more familiar with them personally and their political struggle. Smith continued to report fuller accounts of local news, for instance providing the details of the police shooting in June 1963 of Alfred Brown, an African-American Navy veteran of World War II and father of five who was fatally shot soon after being released from a mental hospital. She described the racism of the police in this incident, including their refusal to let Brown's family go to his aid. In the civil rights years and later, African Americans in Holmes County said they gained optimism from seeing her as an example of a \\"white person [who] showed the capacity to change and the willingness to join them.\\"Bernard L. Stein, \\"This female crusading scalawag\\", first published in Media Studies Journal, Spring/Summer 2000; reposted at academia.edu; accessed 23 December 2018 Initially Holmes County was relatively quiet in terms of civil rights activity, but this changed in 1963 and 1964. In 1964 Smith welcomed the 33 SNCC volunteers who came to the county to educate African Americans and prepare them for registering and voting in what was known as \\"Mississippi Freedom Summer\\". Smith wrote, > ‚ÄúOne of the most popular misconceptions in Mississippi is the idea that if > everyone would just leave us alone we would work out all our problems and > everything would be fine. . . . The truth is we have been left pretty much > alone for nearly one hundred years ‚Äì and we have not faced up to our > problems as well as we should.‚Äù In 1964 Smith was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for her body of work, for editorials opposing the activities of the White Citizens' Council and its support of segregation. Her citation noted her \\"steadfast adherence to her editorial duty in the face of great pressure and opposition.\\" At the same time, she represented herself as a moderate, perhaps to keep as broad a base as possible in her effort to change people's minds. Smith continued to be affected by the violence of this period. In September 1964, her Northside Reporter, located in the state capital of Jackson, was bombed. In 1967, shortly before the Advertiser was to go to press, her printing plant in Lexington was set on fire by arsonists. Smith managed to publish a \\"miniature version\\" of her paper for that edition. But, the WCC's continued boycott of customers and advertisers of her papers took a severe financial toll. In 1965 the Columbia Journalism Review established a fund for Smith: other journalists and editors raised nearly $2700 nationally. Her local support was even greater: blacks from across the economic spectrum in Holmes County raised more than $2855 to help her. The latter money was presented to her on Editor's Appreciation Day by Dr. Arenia Mallory at Saints Junior College, an event organized by African Americans in Holmes County to counter the activities of the White Citizens Council.Jan Whitt, Burning Crosses and Activist Journalism: Hazel Brannon Smith and the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement, University Press of America, 2010, p. 88 In the 1970s Smith finally sold two of her newspapers because of continued financial problems. She was not able to recover financially from economic boycotts. In 1982 her husband died in a fall at home. In 1985 she filed for bankruptcy, and was forced to close her remaining two newspapers, including the Lexington Advertiser. It was the second oldest newspaper in the state, and its building still stands in Lexington, deteriorating and \\"open to the elements.\\" None of these small newspapers survived the loss of her leadership and changes to the industry. In 1986 Smith moved to live with her sister and her family in Gadsden, Alabama, her hometown, suffering from early symptoms of apparent Alzheimer's disease. She later moved to be near nieces in Tennessee. She died there in 1994 in a nursing home in Cleveland, Tennessee. Her body was returned to Alabama, where she was buried near family members in Gadsden. Legacy and honors Smith received other recognition in addition to the Pulitzer Prize: awards from the National Federation of Press Women (1946, 1955), the Herrick Award for Editorial Writing (1956), the Mississippi Press Association (1957). She won the Golden Quill Award of the International Society of Weekly Newspaper Editors in 1963, and in 1964 was named by the National Council of Women as the ‚ÄúWoman of Conscience‚Äù that year. She was president of the International Society of Weekly Newspaper Editors in 1981-82. Death Hazel Freeman Smith died in Cleveland, Tennessee on May 15, 1994, aged 80. Papers Smith's 1945-1976 papers are available to researchers and held at the Special Collections department of the Mississippi State University Library. Films Smith was one of the subjects in the documentary film An Independent Voice (1973) about small-town newspaper editors. Her life was dramatized in the ABC- TV movie A Passion for Justice: The Hazel Brannon Smith Story (1994), with Jane Seymour in the title role. The movie aired several weeks before Smith died. It was based on Kathleen Brady's biographical essay about Smith.

It deals with focusing and other ways of manipulating the X-ray beams for research techniques such as X-ray crystallography, X-ray fluorescence, small-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray microscopy, X-ray phase- contrast imaging, X-ray astronomy etc. Since X-rays and visible light are both electromagnetic waves they propagate in space in the same way, but because of the much higher frequency and photon energy of X-rays they interact with matter very differently. Visible light is easily redirected using lenses and mirrors, but because the real part of the complex refractive index of all materials is very close to 1 for X-rays, they instead tend to initially penetrate and eventually get absorbed in most materials without changing direction much. X-ray techniques There are many different techniques used to redirect X-rays, most of them changing the directions by only minute angles. The most common principle used is reflection at grazing incidence angles, either using total external reflection at very small angles or multilayer coatings. Other principles used include diffraction and interference in the form of zone plates, refraction in compound refractive lenses that use many small X-ray lenses in series to compensate by their number for the minute index of refraction, Bragg reflection off of a crystal plane in flat or bent crystals. X-ray beams are often collimated or reduced in size using pinholes or movable slits typically made out of tungsten or some other high-Z material. Narrow parts of an X-ray spectrum can be selected with monochromators based on one or multiple Bragg reflections off of crystals. X-ray spectra can also be manipulated by having the X-rays pass through a filter (optics). This will typically reduce the low energy part of the spectrum, and possibly parts above absorption edges of the elements used for the filter. Focusing optics Analytical X-ray techniques such as X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy all benefit from high X-ray flux densities on the samples being investigated. This is achieved by focusing the divergent beam from the X-ray source onto the sample using one out of a range of focusing optical components. This is also useful for scanning probe techniques such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and scanning X-ray fluorescence imaging. Polycapillary optics A polycapillary lens for focusing X-rays Polycapillary lenses are arrays of small hollow glass tubes that guide the X-rays with many total external reflections on the inside of the tubes. The array is tapered so that one end of the capillaries points at the X-ray source and the other at the sample. Polycapillary optics are achromatic and thus suitable for scanning fluorescence imaging and other applications where a broad X-ray spectrum is useful. They collect X-rays efficiently for photon energies of 0.1 to 30 keV and can achieve gains of 100 to 10000 in flux over using a pinhole at 100 mm from the X-ray source. Since only X-rays entering the capillaries within a very narrow angle will be totally internally reflected, only X-rays coming from a small spot will be transmitted through the optic. Polycapillary optics cannot image more than one point to another, so they are used for illumination and collection of X-rays. Zone plates Zone plates consist of a substrate with concentric zones of a phase-shifting or absorbing material with zones getting narrower the larger their radius. The zone widths are designed so that a transmitted wave gets constructive interference in a single point giving a focus. Zone plates can be used as condensers to collect light, but also for direct full field imaging in e.g. an X-ray microscope. Zone plates are highly chromatic and usually designed only for a narrow energy span, making it necessary to have monochromatic X-rays for efficient collection and high- resolution imaging. Compound refractive lenses Since refractive indices at x-ray wavelengths are so close to 1, the focal lengths of normal lenses get impractically long. To overcome this lenses with very small radii of curvature are used, and they are stacked in long rows so that the combined focusing power gets appreciable. Since the refractive index is less than 1 for x-rays these lenses must be concave to achieve focusing, contrary to visible light lenses, which are convex for a focusing effect. Radii of curvature are typically less than a millimeter making the usable x-ray beam width at most about 1 mm. To reduce the absorption of x-rays in these stacks, materials with very low atomic number such as beryllium or lithium are typically used. Since the refractive index depends strongly on X-ray wavelength, these lenses are highly chromatic and the variation of the focal length with wavelength must be taken into account for any application. Reflection Designs based on grazing incidence reflection used in X-ray telescopes include that by Kirkpatrick-Baez, and several by Wolter (Wolter I-IV) The basic idea is to reflect a beam of X-rays from a surface and to measure the intensity of X-rays reflected in the specular direction (reflected angle equal to incident angle). It has been shown that a reflection off a parabolic mirror followed by a reflection off a hyperbolic mirror leads to the focusing of X-rays. Since the incoming X-rays must strike the tilted surface of the mirror, the collecting area is small. It can, however, be increased by nesting arrangements of mirrors inside each other. The ratio of reflected intensity to incident intensity is the X-ray reflectivity for the surface. If the interface is not perfectly sharp and smooth, the reflected intensity will deviate from that predicted by the Fresnel reflectivity law. The deviations can then be analyzed to obtain the density profile of the interface normal to the surface. For films with multiple layers, X-ray reflectivity may show oscillations with wavelength, analogous to the Fabry-P√©rot effect. These oscillations can be used to infer layer thicknesses and other properties. Diffraction Symmetrically spaced atoms cause re-radiated X-rays to reinforce each other in the specific directions where their path-length difference, 2 d sin Œ∏ , equals an integer multiple of the wavelength Œª In X-ray diffraction a beam strikes a crystal and diffracts into many specific directions. The angles and intensities of the diffracted beams indicate a three-dimensional density of electrons within the crystal. X-rays produce a diffraction pattern because their wavelength is typically the same order of magnitude (0.1-10.0 nm) as the spacing between the atomic planes in the crystal. Each atom re-radiates a small portion of an incoming beam's intensity as a spherical wave. If the atoms are arranged symmetrically (as is found in a crystal) with a separation d, these spherical waves will be in synch (add constructively) only in directions where their path-length difference 2 d sin Œ∏ is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength Œª. The incoming beam therefore appears to have been deflected by an angle 2Œ∏, producing a reflection spot in the diffraction pattern. X-ray diffraction is a form of elastic scattering in the forward direction; the outgoing X-rays have the same energy, and thus the same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to an inner-shell electron exciting it to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such electron excitation, but not in determining the distribution of atoms within the crystal. Longer-wavelength photons (such as ultraviolet radiation) would not have sufficient resolution to determine the atomic positions. At the other extreme, shorter-wavelength photons such as gamma rays are difficult to produce in large numbers, difficult to focus, and interact too strongly with matter, producing particle-antiparticle pairs. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or neutrons. X-rays are usually not diffracted from atomic nuclei, but only from the electrons surrounding them. Interference X-ray interference is the addition (superposition) of two or more X-ray waves that results in a new wave pattern. X-ray interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency. Two non-monochromatic X-ray waves are only fully coherent with each other if they both have exactly the same range of wavelengths and the same phase differences at each of the constituent wavelengths. The total phase difference is derived from the sum of both the path difference and the initial phase difference (if the X-ray waves are generated from two or more different sources). It can then be concluded whether the X-ray waves reaching a point are in phase (constructive interference) or out of phase (destructive interference). Technologies There are a variety of techniques used to funnel X-ray photons to the appropriate location on an X-ray detector: * Grazing incidence mirrors in a Wolter telescope, or a Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray reflection microscope, * Zone plates, * Bent crystals, * Normal-incidence mirrors making use of multilayer coatings, * A normal-incidence lens much like an optical lens, such as a compound refractive lens, * Microstructured optical arrays, namely capillary/polycapillary optical systems,An introduction to X-Ray OpticsPolycapillary Optics * Coded aperture imaging, * Modulation collimators, or * X-ray waveguides. Most X-ray optical elements (with the exception of grazing incidence mirrors) are very small, and must be designed for a particular incident angle and energy, thus limiting their applications in divergent radiation. Although the technology has advanced rapidly, its practical uses outside research are still limited. Efforts are ongoing, however, to introduce X-ray optics in medical X-ray imaging. For instance, one of the applications showing greater promise is in enhancing both the contrast and resolution of mammographic images, compared to conventional anti-scatter grids. Another application is to optimize the energy distribution of the X-ray beam to improve contrast-to-noise ratio compared to conventional energy filtering. Mirrors for X-ray optics The mirrors can be made of glass, ceramic, or metal foil, coated by a reflective layer. The most commonly used reflective materials for X-ray mirrors are gold and iridium. Even with these the critical reflection angle is energy dependent. For gold at 1 keV, the critical reflection angle is 2.4 degrees. The utilization of X-ray mirrors simultaneously requires: * the ability to determine the location of the arrival of an X-ray photon in two dimensions * a reasonable detection efficiency. Multilayers for X-Rays No material has substantial reflection for x-rays except at very small grazing angles. Multilayers enhance the small reflectivity from a single boundary by adding the small reflected amplitudes from many boundaries coherently in phase. For example, if a single boundary has a reflectivity of R=10-4 (amplitude r=10-2) the addition of 100 amplitudes from 100 boundaries can give reflectivity R close to one. The period Œõ of the multilayer that provides the in-phase addition is that of the standing wave produced by the input and output beam, Œõ=Œª/2 sinŒ∏ , where Œª is the wavelength and 2Œ∏ the half angle between the two beams. For Œ∏=90¬∞ or reflection at normal incidence the period of the multilayer is Œõ=Œª/2. The shortest period that can be used in a multilayer is limited by the size of the atoms to about 2nm corresponding to wavelengths above 4nm. For shorter wavelength a reduction of the incidence angle Œ∏ toward more grazing has to be used. The materials for multilayers are selected to give the highest possible reflection at each boundary and the smallest absorption or the propagation through the structure. This is usually achieved by light, low density materials for the spacer layer and a heavier material that produces high contrast. The absorption in the heavier material can be reduced by positioning it close to the nodes of the standing wave field inside the structure. Good low absorption spacer materials are Be, C, B, B4 C and Si. W, Rh, Ru and Mo are some examples of the heavier materials with good contrast. Applications include: * normal and grazing incidence optics for telescopes from EUV to hard X-Ray. * microscopes, beam lines at synchrotron and FEL facilities. * EUV lithography. Mo/Si is the material selection used for the near normal incidence reflectors for EUV lithography. Hard X-ray mirrors An X-ray mirror optic for NuStar space telescope working up 79 keV, was made using multi-layered coatings, computer aided manufacturing, and other techniques.NuStar: Instrumentation: Optics The mirrors use a Tungsten (W) / Silicon (Si) or Platinum (Pt) / Silicon Carbide (SiC) multi-coating on slumped glass, allowing a Wolter telescope design.

The Chicago Tribune in a 1991 article reported that Hyles was sued for $1 million by the parents of the girl molested by Ballenger. The paper reported the \\"lawsuit claims Hyles and the church had not fulfilled their obligation to ensure that children were protected from harm during Sunday school.\\" This stemmed from their mentioning the molestation to Hyles who then promised to \\"investigate\\".

Northwest Indiana Times August 28, 1996  Investigation  The Detroit news program was not the only one to study if there was a connection between deacon Ballenger at Hyles' church and the North Sharon associate pastor, who graduated from Hyles-Anderson College. The prosecuting attorney for Washtenaw County, Michigan went to the Ballenger trial \\"to watch, listen to testimony and observe similarities between this case and other cases involving a rural church [in] Michigan.\\" On May 14, 1993 \\"the FBI was asked to look into allegations minors were taken from Michigan to Northwest Indiana by employees or officials of North Sharon Baptist Church near Ann Arbor for events sponsored by Hammond First Baptist Church.\\" The FBI concluded, \\"there is insufficient evidence to probe allegations.\\" On Friday, May 19, 1993 Sgt. Charles Hedinger, a Hammond police detective, described the Hyles investigation as \\"open-ended.\\" Jack Hyles said that he welcomed an investigation by the police and he attended a meeting with city officials to discuss it. Hyles emerged from the meeting saying that there was no investigation. Confirmation of this came on Wednesday, May 24, 1993, the Chief of Police detectives, Capt. Bill Conner was quoted in the Tribune saying that, \\"There is no investigation of the First Baptist Church of Hammond or Jack Hyles\\". On June 1, 1993 The Lake County, Indiana prosecutor's office stated that it did not have any cases involving Hyles or the First Baptist Church of Hammond.On the same day, the Hammond Police Department reaffirmed the statement it made the previous month when it confirmed that there was no investigation of Hyles or the church.  Criticism of WJBK  Hyles told his congregation that WJBK's news anchorman was fired and 12 sponsors had dropped the evening news, but Mort Meisner, news director for WJBK, said neither of those statements were true. On May 19, 1993, The Times of Northwest Indiana ran a story entitled Baptism by innuendo, which criticized WJBK-TV's reporting. The Times wrote, \\"If one were to take the insinuations of Detroit television station WJBK-TV seriously, one could get the impression that the First Baptist Church of Hammond is a sex-crime factory and that its pastors school in Hammond and the affiliated Hyles Anderson College in Schererville are institutions where people minor in molestation.\\"Baptism by innuendo Northwest Indiana Times May 19, 1993 The Times also suggested that the May ratings period, which is traditionally known for such similar sensationalized stories, was not a good enough excuse to make up for the poor journalism the stories displayed, concluding that the stories were \\"a monstrous overreach\\". The Times went on to say: \\"There is no large institution of any kind where some wrongdoers cannot be found. First Baptist and its affiliated institutions are no exception. To tar an entire congregation or student body and alumni with indiscriminate innuendo is highly irresponsible.\\" Soon afterwards, Hyles gave a speech in which he disputed the latest reports point by point. During that speech, Hyles said that those that the report indicated had attended Hyles-Anderson College really had not even attended the school. Several hundred people signed a statement supporting Hyles' in an advertisement placed in the Tuesday June 1, 1993 Chicago Sun-Times.

History Campos Belos began around the small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception in 1881. Lands were donated by local cattle ranchers for the foundation of the new town. In 1889 the settlement was elevated to district, belonging to Arraias, which is now part of the state of Tocantins. In 1953 Campos Belos became a city. Development took off with the construction of Bras√≠lia in the 1950s and its inauguration in 1960. By the end of the 1970s the city had its first banking agencies and in the 1980s it was integrated into the national telephone system. A major change occurred in 1988 when the state of Goi√°s was divided. Campos Belos became an inter-state municipality. Growth was substantial in the decade of the 1990s since the city began to supply the population of the new state of Tocantins, which did not have an adequate commercial infrastructure. With the construction of Palmas, the city acquired an alternative route of access to the north of the country.

Logic hazards are manifestations of a problem in which changes in the input variables do not change the output correctly due to some form of delay caused by logic elements (NOT, AND, OR gates, etc.) This results in the logic not performing its function properly. The three different most common kinds of hazards are usually referred to as static, dynamic and function hazards. Hazards are a temporary problem, as the logic circuit will eventually settle to the desired function. Therefore, in synchronous designs, it is standard practice to register the output of a circuit before it is being used in a different clock domain or routed out of the system, so that hazards do not cause any problems. If that is not the case, however, it is imperative that hazards be eliminated as they can have an effect on other connected systems. Static hazards A static hazard is the situation where, when one input variable changes, the output changes momentarily before stabilizing to the correct value. There are two types of static hazards: * Static-1 Hazard: the output is currently 1 and after the inputs change, the output momentarily changes to 0,1 before settling on 1 * Static-0 Hazard: the output is currently 0 and after the inputs change, the output momentarily changes to 1,0 before settling on 0 In properly formed two-level AND-OR logic based on a Sum Of Products expression, there will be no static-0 hazards. Conversely, there will be no static-1 hazards in an OR-AND implementation of a Product Of Sums expression. The most commonly used method to eliminate static hazards is to add redundant logic (consensus terms in the logic expression). Example of a static hazard Consider an imperfect circuit that suffers from a delay in the physical logic elements i.e. AND gates etc. The simple circuit performs the function noting: : \\\\overline{f(A,B,C)} = AB + \\\\overline{A}C From a look at the starting diagram it is clear that if no delays were to occur, then the circuit would function normally. However, no two gates are ever manufactured exactly the same. Due to this imperfection, the delay for the first AND gate will be slightly different than its counterpart. Thus an error occurs when the input changes from 111 to 011. i.e. when X1 changes state. Now we know roughly how the hazard is occurring, for a clearer picture and the solution on how to solve this problem, we would look to the Karnaugh map. The two gates are shown by solid rings, and the hazard can be seen under the dashed ring. A theorem proved by Huffman tells us that by adding a redundant loop 'X2X3' this will eliminate the hazard. So our original function is now: f = X1 * X2 \\\\+ X1' * X3 \\\\+ X2 * X3 Now we can see that even with imperfect logic elements, our example will not show signs of hazards when X1 changes state. This theory can be applied to any logic system. Computer programs deal with most of this work now, but for simple examples it is quicker to do the debugging by hand. When there are many input variables (say 6 or more) it will become quite difficult to 'see' the errors on a Karnaugh map. Dynamic hazards A dynamic hazard is the possibility of an output changing more than once as a result of a single input change. Dynamic hazards often occur in larger logic circuits where there are different routes to the output (from the input). If each route has a different delay, then it quickly becomes clear that there is the potential for changing output values that differ from the required / expected output. E.g. A logic circuit is meant to change output state from 1 to 0, but instead changes from 1 to 0 then 1 and finally rests at the correct value 0. This is a dynamic hazard. As a rule, dynamic hazards are more complex to resolve, but note that if all static hazards have been eliminated from a circuit, then dynamic hazards cannot occur. Functional hazards In contrast to static and dynamic hazards, functional hazards are ones caused by a change applied to more than one input. There is no specific logical solution to eliminate them. One really reliable method is preventing inputs from changing simultaneously, which is not applicable in some cases. So, circuits should be carefully designed to have equal delays in each path.

The Security Council was convinced of the need as a temporary measure to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people until the country complied with all relevant Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 687 (1991) which allowed for further measures to be taken concerning sanctions imposed in Resolution 661 (1991). Provisions Firstly, countries were authorised to permit the import of petroleum, petroleum products and related financial transactions originating in Iraq for a total sum of up to US$ 1 billion every 90 days, subject to the approval of the Committee established in Resolution 661 and that payments made for oil would be made into the escrow account created by the current resolution. Turkey was permitted to charge fees for using the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline in its territory. The aforementioned would come into force at 00:01 EST the day after the President of the Security Council announced that he had received a report by the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, with the provisions remaining in force for an initial period of 180 days. A review would be conducted halfway through this period. The following provisions would come into immediate effect. Independent inspectors and the Committee would inspect oil sales and an escrow account would be established. The account would: :(a) finance the export of medicine, health supplies, foodstuffs, and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs, which the Government of Iraq should agree to their equitable distribution; :(b) complement the distribution of humanitarian goods by the Iraqi government; :(c) transfer the same percentage of the funds deposited in the escrow account to the United Nations Compensation Commission decided by Resolution 705 (1991); :(d) finance the independent inspectors and certified public accountants and other activities; :(e) meet the operational costs of the United Nations Special Commission; :(f) meet other expenses and costs; :(g) make available up to US$ 10 million every 90 days for payments envisaged in Resolution 778 (1992). Countries were authorised, notwithstanding the provisions of Resolution 661, to export parts and equipment which are essential for the safe operation of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline in Iraq and activities associated with it. The costs may be paid by credit pending payment into the escrow account. The Secretary-General was requested to report at 90 days and 180 days during the process, while the Committee was required to develop procedures necessary to implement the above provisions. Both were urged to take effective action to ensure the implementation of the resolution. The Council provided immunity for the petroleum and petroleum products, the escrow account and all personnel working with the United Nations in accordance with the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. The resolution concluded by reaffirming that none of its provisions should affect Iraq's obligations concerning the repayment of foreign debt, and at the same time should not infringe on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Aftermath Iraq initially rejected the resolution on the grounds that it violated its sovereignty, and did not accept its provisions until January 1996. The programme was formally terminated on 21 November 2003 following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and its major functions turned over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.UN Office of the Iraq Program ‚Äì Oil-for-Food See also * Foreign relations of Iraq * Gulf War * Invasion of Kuwait * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 901 to 1000 (1994‚Äì1995) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 706 References External links * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0986 0986 Category:1995 in Iraq Category:April 1995 events ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 986"},{"id":"4260117","text":"Ceratopetalum gummiferum Ceratopetalum is a genus of nine species of shrub and tree in the family Cunoniaceae.

According to the Muslim belief and Islamic scholarly accounts, the revelation of the Qur'an began in 610 AD when the angel Gabriel (Arabic: ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ, Jibrƒ´l or ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ, JabrƒÅ æƒ´l) appeared to Muhammad in the cave Hira near Mecca, reciting to him the first verses of Surah Al-Alaq. Muslims believe that Muhammad continued to have revelations for the rest of life until his death in 632 AD. According to Islamic tradition, the Qur'an was first compiled into a book format by Zayd ibn Thabit and other scribes under the first caliph ‚Äî Abu Bakr Siddiq. As the Islamic Empire began to grow, and differing recitations were heard in far-flung areas, the Quran was recompiled for uniformity in recitation (r. 644‚Äì56). under the direction of the third caliph ‚Äî Uthman ibn Affan. For this reason, the Qur'an as it exists today is also known as the Uthmanic codex. According to Professor Francis Edward Peters (1927), what was done to the Quran in the process seems to have been extremely conservative and the content was formed in a mechanical fashion to avoid redactional bias.F. E. Peters, \\"The Quest of the Historical Muhammad, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 23, No. 3 (August 1991), p. 297. Origin according to Islamic tradition According to traditional Islamic beliefs, the Quran was revealed to Muhammad, a trader in the western Arabian city of Mecca founded by the prophet Ismail, had become a sanctuary for pagan deities and an important trading center. The revelations started one night during the month of Ramadan in 610, when Muhammad, at the age of forty, received the first visit from the angel Gabriel. The Quran uses the term ummi to describe Muhammad. The majority of Muslim scholars interpret this word as a reference to an illiterate individual, though some modern scholars instead interpret it as a reference to those who belong to a community without a scripture. According to the famous collector of traditions of Muhammad, Muhammad al-Bukhari (who lived about 250 years after Muhammad), Muhammad's wife Khadija bint Khuwaylid described that the first Quranic revelation occurred when the angel Gabriel visited Muhammad and asked him to recite. Muhammad responded ma ana bƒ´qƒÅre'u, which could be translated into a number of ways: 'I do not read' or 'what am I to read/recite?' or 'I will not read/recite'. Gabriel pressed him \\"until all the strength went out of me; thereupon he released me and said: 'Read!'\\" This was repeated three times and upon the third, Gabriel released him and said, \\"Read in the name of the Sustainer who created humankind from a clot! Read! And your Sustainer is the most Beautiful.\\" After this Muhammad continued to have revelations sporadically over a period of twenty-three years, until shortly before his death in 11/632. Muslims believe that Gabriel brought the word of God to Muhammad verbatim, and the Quran was divinely protected from any alteration or change. The Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text and that he had no authority to change it. It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. According to tradition, Muhammad described the experience of revelation: > \\"Sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell. This form of > inspiration is the hardest of them all and then it passes off after I have > grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and > talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.\\" At times, it was also reported that the experience was painful for Muhammad. For example, he had been heard saying, \\"Never once did I receive a revelation without thinking that my soul had been torn away from me.\\" After Muhammad would receive revelations, he would later recite it to his companions, who also memorized it or wrote it down. Before the Quran was commonly available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching it to others. The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practised among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in Arabic. This fact, taken in the context of 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest. Non- Muslim people questioned the nature and modes of Muhammad's revelations. The Meccans interpreted the Quranic revelations based on their understanding of 'inspiration'. For them, poetry was closely connected to inspiration from a higher spiritual source. For this reason when Muhammad began preaching and reciting the Quran, the Meccans accused him of being a poet or a \\"poet possessed\\". Due to the fact that the Quran was revealed in disjointed verses and chapters, a point came when it needed to be gathered into a coherent whole text. There are disagreements among both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars as to when the Quran was first compiled. A hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the caliph Abu Bakr commanded Zayd ibn Thabit to compile the written Quran, relying upon both textual fragments and the memories of those who had memorized it. Some Shia Muslims believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib was the first to compile the Quran into one written text, a task completed shortly after the death of Muhammad. Muhammad The society during the time of Muhammad was predominantly oral and for this reason he would recite the Quranic verses to his Companions for them to memorize. Therefore, it is unknown whether the Quran was ever written and collected during the time of Muhammad. While writing was not a common skill during Muhammad's time, Mecca, being a commercial center, had a number of people who could write. Some scholars believe that several scribes including Zayd ibn Thabit and Ubay ibn Ka'b recorded verses of the Quran. This provides an explanation as to how the Quran existed in written form during the life of Muhammad, even if it was not compiled into one text. (According to one source, sira (prophetic biography) of Muhammad list the following as scribes of the Quran: Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, ‚ÄòUmar ibn al-Khattaab, ‚ÄòUthmaan ibn ‚ÄòAffaan, ‚ÄòAli ibn Abi Taalib, al-Zubayr ibn al-‚ÄòAwwaam, ‚ÄòAamir ibn Fuhayrah, ‚ÄòAmr ibn al-‚ÄòAas, Ubayy ibn Ka‚Äôb, ‚ÄòAbd- Allaah ibn al-Arqam, Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas, Hanzalah ibn al-Rabee‚Äô al- Usaydi, al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‚Äôbah, ‚ÄòAbd-Allaah ibn Rawaahah, Khaalid ibn al- Waleed, Khaalid ibn Sa‚Äôeed ibn al-‚ÄòAas (whom it was said was the first one to write down anything for him), Mu‚Äôaawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan and Zayd ibn Thaabit. Sunni and Shia scholars generally believe that the Quran was written down in its entirety at the time of Muhammad's death. Muhammad's cousin Ibn Abbas describes the way in which the final version of the Quran was fixed: \\"the prophet recited the book before Gabriel every year in the month of Ramadan, and in the month in which he died he recited it before him twice.\\" It is believed that the term \\"reciting the Quran twice\\" means compiling all the Quranic revelations into a complete and final version. It is understood that toward the end of Muhammad's life a special act of revelation occurred in which a final and complete version of the Quran was created. The term 'recite', which is used here, is referring to the custom where a Quranic scholar recites the entire Quran from beginning to end a number of times before a senior scholar. According to this tradition the act of recital is being performed by Muhammad, with the angel Gabriel playing the role of superior authority. In one of the hadith Muhammad is recorded as saying: \\"I leave among you two things of high estimation: the Book of God and my Family.\\" Some scholars argue that this provides evidence that the Quran had been collected and written during this time because it is not correct to call something al-kitab (book) when it is merely in the [people's] memories. The word al-kitab signifies a single and united entity and does not apply to a text which is scattered and not collected. Another argument some Shia and Sunni scholars bring up is the importance that Muhammad attached to the Quran. They believe that since Muhammad put so much importance to the Quran he had to have ordered the writing of it during his lifetime. For example, Zayd ibn Thabit reported, \\"We used to record the Quran from parchments in the presence of the Messenger of God.\\" Some authors believe that, as long as Muhammad was alive, there was always the expectation of further revelation as well as occasional abrogations. Any formal collection of the material already revealed could not properly be considered a complete text. Ali ibn Abi Talib Shia scholars are unanimous that Ali ibn Abi Talib possessed a personal transcript of the Quran, which he collected six months after Muhammad's death, and that this was the first compilation of the Quran. The unique aspect about this version is that it was collected in the order it was sent, which mainstream Shi'ites hold is the only difference between the Quran we have today and Ali's. A few Shia scholars argue that Ali presented his Quran to the community, but they refused to acknowledge his copy. One report states, \\"he had brought the complete Book [of God], comprising the interpretation and the revelation, the precise and ambiguous verses, the abrogating and the abrogated verses; nothing was missing from it, [not even] a letter alif, nor lam. But they did not accept it from him\\" They also believe that Ali's version of the Quran contained verses that are not seen in the Uthmanic codex we have today. They believe changes in the order of verses and suras did take place and that there were variant readings, tabdil, exchange of words such as umma to imma, rearrangement of words and deletion of words pertaining to the right of Ali being the first caliph. The contemporary Shia scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei provides a counter argument to this belief. He states that even if Ali's Quran incorporated additions that are not part of the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions are not part of the standard Quran and not considered part of what the Muslim Messenger of God was commanded to convey to his community. Abu Bakr According to Sunni scholars, during the life of Muhammad parts of the Quran, though written, were scattered among his companions, much of it as private possession. The amount of Scribes was 43 companions. And there were many people who though were not scribes also were complete memorizers. After Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr initially exercised a policy of laissez faire as well. This policy was reversed after the Battle of Yamama in 633. During the battle, 70 Muslims who had memorized the Quran were killed. The death of Salim, however, was most significant, as he was one of the very few who had been entrusted by Muhammad to teach the Quran. Consequently, upon Umar's insistence, Abu Bakr ordered the collection of the hitherto scattered pieces of the Quran into one copy. Zayd ibn Thabit, Muhammad's primary scribe, was assigned the duty of gathering all of the Quranic text. He gives an insight into what happened during the meeting between Abu Bakr, Umar, and himself: :\\" Abu Bakr sent for me at a time when the Yamama battles had witnessed the martyrdom of numerous Companions. I found 'Umar bin al-Khattab with him. Abu Bakr began, Umar has just come to me and said, 'In the Yamama battles death has dealt most severely with the qurra',[Reciters of the Quran] and I fear it will deal with them with equal severity in other theatres of war. As a result much of the Quran will be gone. \\" 'I am therefore of the opinion that you should command the Quran be collected.'\\" Abu Bakr continued, \\"I said to 'Umar, 'How can we embark on what the Prophet never did?' 'Umar replied that it was a good deed regardless, and he did not cease replying to my scruples until Allah reconciled me to the undertaking, and I became of the same mind as him. Zaid, you are young and intelligent, you used to record the revelations for Muhammad, and we know nothing to your discredit. So pursue the Quran and collect it together.\\" By Allah, had they asked me to move a mountain it could not have been weightier than what they requested of me now\\". (Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Jam'i al-Qur'an, hadith no. 4986; see also Ibn Abu Dawud, al-Masahif, pp. 6-9) His reaction to the task and its difficulties are further explained: :\\"...By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Quran... So I started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men. [Bukhari ] Al-Zarakhsi comments, :What Zaid means in fact is that he sought out verses from scattered sources, to collate them against the recollections of the huffaz. In this way everyone participated in the collection process. No one possessing any portion of it was left out, and so no one had reason for expressing concern about the verses collected, nor could anyone complain that the text had been gathered from only a select few. Zayd also said: :\\"So I started looking for the Holy quran and collected it from (what was written on) palm-leaf stalks, thin white stones, and also from men who knew it by heart, until I found the last verse of Surat at-Tauba (repentance) with Abi Khuzaima al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 478). Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani draws special attention to Zayd's statement, \\"I found two verses of Sura al- Bara'a with Abu Khuzaima al-Ansari,\\" as demonstrating that Zayd's own writings and memorization were not deemed sufficient. Everything required verification.Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami (2003), The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments, p.83. UK Islamic Academy. . Ibn Hajar further comments: :Abu Bakr had not authorized him to record except what was already available [on parchment]. That is why Zaid refrained from including the final ayah of Sura Bara'a until he came upon it in written form, even though he and his fellow Companions could recall it perfectly well from memory. The task required Zayd ibn Thabit to collect written copies of the Quran, with each verse having been validated with the oral testimony of at least two companions. The Quran was collected under the auspices of committee of four senior ranking Companions headed by Zayd ibn Thabit. This compilation was kept by the Caliph Abu Bakr, after his death by his successor, Caliph Umar, who on his deathbed gave them to Hafsa bint Umar, his daughter and one of Muhammad's widows. Sunnis dismiss the Shia version of the Quranic compilation as nothing more than Twelver Shia fabrications. They point to the fact that Zaydi Shias who form the oldest living Shia sect believe in the above events described in Sahih Bukhari. The famous ten People who form the chains of narration regarding the Quran are as follows. *Umar ibn al Khattab *Uthman bin Affan *Ali ibn abi Talib *Abu Musa al Ash'ari *Ubay Ibn Ka'b *Abdullah ibn Masood *Zayd Ibn Thabit *Abu Hurairah *Abdullah Ibn Abbas *Abu al-Darda Of those ten, the two most important people were Zayd ibn Thabit the personal scribe of Muhammad and Ubay ibn Ka'b who was the foremost authority on the Quran after Zaid. Uthman ibn Affan and the canonization According to Islamic tradition the process of canonization ended under the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 23/644‚Äì35/655), about twenty years after the death of Muhammad.650 CE (The date is not exact because it was not recorded by early Arab annalists).Cook, The Koran, 2000: p.119 The Qur'anic canon is the form of the Quran as recited and written in which it is religiously binding for the Muslim community. This canonical corpus is closed and fixed in the sense that nothing in the Quran can be changed or modified. By the time of Uthman's caliphate, there was a perceived need for clarification of Qur'an reading. The Caliphate had grown considerably, expanding into Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Iran, bringing into Islam's fold many new converts from various cultures with varying degrees of isolation. These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman felt it was important to standardize the written text of the Quran into one specific Arabic dialect. Another reason for compiling the Quran was that many Muslims who had memorized the Quran in its entirety (huffaz) were dying, especially in battle. According to the dominant version narrated by Bukhari, the reason for the final collection of the Quran was a dispute between Muslim forces from Iraq and Syria over the correct way of reciting it during communal prayers while on an expedition to Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is believed that the general Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman reported this problem to the caliph and asked him to establish a unified text. According to the history of al-Tabari, during the expedition there were 10,000 Kufan warriors, 6,000 in Azerbaijan and 4,000 at Rayy. A large number of soldiers disagreeing about the correct way of reciting the Quran may have caused Hudhayfah to promote a unified text. An example of the confusion at this time is seen during a campaign in Tabaristan, where one of the soldiers asked, Hudhayfah \\"How did the Messenger of God pray?\\" Hudhayfah told him the soldier prayed before fighting. It is believed upon Hudhayfah's request Uthman obtained the sheets of the Quran from ·∏§af·π£a and appointed a commission consisting of Zayd and three prominent Meccans, and instructed them to copy the sheets into several volumes based on the dialect of Quraysh, the main tribe of Mecca. Uthman's reaction in 653 is recorded in the following: :\\"So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, \\"Send us the manuscripts of the Quran so that we may compile the Quranic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.\\" Hafsa sent it to Uthman. Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, Abdullah bin Az Zubair, Said bin Al-As and Abdur Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, \\"In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Quran was revealed in their tongue.\\" They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Zayd bin Thabit added, \\"A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Quran and I used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. [That verse was]: 'Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.'\\"[Bukhari ] When the task was finished Uthman kept one copy in Medina and sent others to Kufa, Ba·π£ra, Damascus, and, according to some accounts, Mecca, and ordered that all other variant copies of the Quran be destroyed. This was done everywhere except in Kufa, where some scholars argue that Ibn Mas ø≈´d and his followers refused. It is also important that the compilation of the Quran during the time of Caliph Abu Bakr which was inherited by Caliph Umar's daughter Hafsa (and a wife of Muhammad) was not destroyed but was passed back to her. This would imply that the first compilation, during the time of Abu Bakr, was not at variation with the Uthmanic compilation. It is generally accepted that the Uthmanic text comprises all 114 suras in the order known today. Beliefs of Shia Muslim about the origins of the Quran may differ in some respects from Sunni beliefs. According to influential Marja' Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, Uthman's collection of the Quran was metaphorical, not physical. He did not collect the verses and suras in one volume, but in the sense that he united the Muslims on the reading of one authoritative recension. al-Khoei also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad. This is one of the most contested issues and an area where many non- Muslim and Muslim scholars often clash. Origin according to academic historians The origin of the Quran has been a subject of sustained academic research. There have also been a number of proposals for refinement of the traditional view and even its fundamental re-evaluation. Until around the 1970s, non-Muslim scholars‚Äîwhile not accepting the divinity of the Quran‚Äîdid accept its Islamic origin story.Holland, 'In the Shadow of the Sword, 2012: p.45 Ernest Renan famously declared that \\"Islam was born, not amid the mystery which cradles the origins of other religions, but rather in the full light of history\\"Cilliot, Claude \\"Muhammad, le Curan et les \`Contraites de l'Histoire\`\\" in Wild, Stefan (editor): The Qur'an as Text (Leiden, 1966), p.4 \\\\-- an empire ruling in the name of the religion of Islam and whose expansion was fuelled by religious fervor, and which presided over the compilation, editing, approving and distributing of the holy book of that religion (the Quran). But in the 1970s revisionist historians began to question Islamic \\"literary sources\\" \\\\-- tafsir (commentaries on the Quran), hadith (accounts of what the Islamic prophet Muhammad approved of or didn't), and sira (biography of the prophet) -- upon which the traditional account of the Quran were based. They employed a \\"source-critical\\" approach to this literature, including as evidence relevant archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, and contemporary non-Arabic literature,Neva & Koren, \\"Methodological Approaches to Islamic Studies\\", 2000: p.420 that they argued provided \\"hard facts\\" and an ability to crosscheck.Neva & Koren, \\"Methodological Approaches to Islamic Studies\\", 2000: p.422-6 By 2008, Fred Donner was summarizing the state of the field in the following terms: Islamic historians Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, John Wansbrough, and archaeologist Yehuda D. Nevo all argue that all the primary Islamic historical sources which exist are from 150‚Äì300 years after the events which they describe, leaving several generations for events to be forgotten, misinterpreted, distorted, garbled, etc.Yehuda D.

Crone and M.

Puin as quoted in about 40 year later than traditional Islamic history. Author Journalist and scholar Toby Lester notes the Quran \\"assumes a familiarity with language, stories, and events that seem to have been lost even to the earliest of Muslim exegetes\\". Cook (and Christopher Rose) note the Quran contains obscure words and phrases, \\"mystery letters\\" (Muqatta øat -- groups of between one and four letters that do not form words and begin about one quarter of surahs of the Quran), and the \\"Sabians\\" religious group unknown to historians.Cook, The Koran, 2000: p.138 Cook argue that \\"someone must once have known\\" what these mean, and that their meaning was forgotten now suggests the Quran may have been \\"off the scene for several decades\\".Cook, The Koran, 2000: p.140 (Pious Muslims argue that there are many things in Islam known only to God.)

According to tradition, the Quran was composed in the early 7th century CE, but according to historian Tom Holland, \\"only in the 690's did a Caliph finally get around to inscribing the Prophet's name on a public monument; only decades after that did the first tentative references to him start to appear in private inscriptions\\".Holland, 'In the Shadow of the Sword, 2012: p.41 Regarding the collection and editing of the Quran into a book (Mus'haf), historian Michael Cook writes that while there is \\"more or less\\" common ground among hadith (aka traditions) that Muhammad did not do it but that this task was completed by the end of the reign of Caliph Uthman. Otherwise hadith do not agree: > We learn that some of Muhammad's followers already knew the whole Quran by > heart in his lifetime -- yet subsequently it had to pieced together out of > fragments collected from here and there.

The accounts of non-Muslim conquered peoples also conflict with the accounts of traditional Islamic literature. Examining 7th century Byzantine Christian sources commentary on the Arab \\"immigrants\\" (Mhaggraye) who were invading/settling in formerly Byzantine territory at that time, historian Abdul-Massih Saadi found the Christians never mentioned the terms \\"Quran\\" nor \\"Islam\\" nor that the immigrants were of a new religion.Saadi, \\"Nascent Islam in the Seventh Century Syriac Sources\\", 2008: p.219-220 They referred to the immigrants in ethnic terms -- \\"among them (Arabs) there are many Christians...\\".Saadi, \\"Nascent Islam in the Seventh Century Syriac Sources\\", 2008: p.217-18 The Christians used secular or political, not religious terms (kings, princes, rulers) to refer to the Arab leaders. Muhammad was \\"the first king of the Mhaggraye\\", also guide, teacher, leader or great ruler. They did however mention the religion of the Arabs. The immigrants' religion was described as monotheist \\"in accordance with the Old Law (Old Testament)\\". When the Emir of the immigrants and Patriarch of the local Christians did have a religious colloquium there was much discussion of the scriptures but no mention of the Quran, \\"a possible indication that the Quran was not yet in circulation.\\" The Christians reported the Emir was accompanied by \\"learned Jews\\", that the immigrants \\"accepted the Torah just as the Jews and Samaritans\\", though none of the sources described the immigrants as Jews. Wansbrough's students Crone and Cook co-authored a book called Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World (1977). Crone, Wansbrough, and Nevo argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150-300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.Yehuda D.

The structure, the oldest extant example of early Islamic architecture, was completed in 691 In dating of the text, the Dome of the Rock inscriptions, which have been known for over a century, are significant. The inner face of the octagon include the declaration of faith and verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though uncited in the Quran, was already in use in 694. Then Christians are preached about the prophet-hood and mortality of Jesus, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. At the end, people are commanded to bend to His will and punishment is threatened otherwise. The absence of contemporaneous corroborating material from the very first century of Islam has raised numerous questions as to the authenticity of the account provided by later traditionalist sources. All that is preserved from this time period are a few commemorative building inscriptions and assorted coins. However, some scholars deny such a belittlement of key sources from the era. Besides the Dome of the Rock inscriptions mentioned above, there are also brief Quranic passages on coins issued from the time of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (697-750). These passages include the shahadah, verses 112:1-3 (or 4) complete (except for the initial basmallah and the introductory word \\"say\\"), and part of 9:33, but with some variations: \\"He sent him with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion...\\" Similar to the contemporary inscriptions at the Dome of the Rock these portions are clearly intended to declare the primacy of the new religion of Islam over Christianity, in particular. Skeptical scholars, nonetheless, point out that the earliest account of Muhammad's life by Ibn Ishaq was written about a century after Muhammad died and all later narratives by Islamic biographers contain far more details and embellishments about events which are entirely lacking in Ibn Ishaq's text.Patricia Crone, Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, pp. 203-30, where she argues that much of the classical Muslim understanding of the Koran rests on the work of storytellers and that this work is of very dubious historical value. These storytellers contributed to the tradition on the rise of Islam, and this is evident in the steady growth of information: \\"If one storyteller should happen to mention a raid, the next storyteller would know the date of this raid, while the third would know everything that an audience might wish to hear about it.\\" 53 Then, comparing the accounts of the raid of Kharrar by Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi, Crone shows that al-Waqidi, influenced by and in the manner of the storytellers, \\"will always give precise dates, locations, names, where Ibn Ishaq has none, accounts of what triggered the expedition, miscellaneous information to lend color to the event, as well as reasons why, as was usually the case, no fighting took place.\\" Patricia Crone, studying the origins of the Quran, has focused on the examination of the vast body of the Greek, Armenian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, and Coptic accounts of non-Muslim neighbours of the 7th and 8th centuries which in many cases contradict the traditional Islamic narratives. She argues that the consistency of the non-Muslim sources spread over a large geographic area would tend to rule out a non-Muslim anti-Islamic motive to these sources.Patricia Crone, Slaves on Horses, pp. 15-16. The sceptic approach has been further expanded by Christoph Luxenberg, who supports claims for a late composition of the Quran, and traces much of it to sources other than Muhammad. Luxenberg is known for his thesis that the Quran is merely a re-working of an earlier Christian text, a Syriac lectionary.The Syro-Aramaic Reading Of The Qur'an, 2007 English edition (See also the articles Gerd R. Puin, and Alexander the Great in the Quran.) Fred Donner has argued for an early date for the collection of the Quran, based on his reading of the text itself. He points out that if the Quran had been collected over the tumultuous early centuries of Islam, with their vast conquests and expansion and bloody incidents between rivals for the caliphate, there would have been some evidence of this history in the text. However, there is nothing in the Quran that does not reflect what is known of the earliest Muslim community.Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing, Donner, Darwin Press, 1998, p. 60, . In 1972, during the restoration of the Great Mosque of San'a in Yemen, labourers stumbled upon a \\"paper grave\\" containing tens of thousands of fragments of parchment on which verses of the Quran were written. Some of these fragments were believed to be the oldest Quranic texts yet found. The latest in origin of the Quran is the discovery of parchments of Quranic text by the University of Birmingham, the parchment (the material) has been radiocarbon dated to the period between 568 and 645 with 95.4% accuracy. The test was carried out in a laboratory at the University of Oxford. The result places the parchment close to the time of Muhammad, who is generally thought to have lived between 570 and 632. Researchers conclude that the parchment is among the earliest written textual evidence of the Quran in existence. Textual criticism In the 1970s, what has been described as a \\"wave of sceptical scholars\\" challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies.Donner, Fred Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing, Darwin Press, 1998 They argued that the Islamic historical tradition had been greatly corrupted in transmission. They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources such as coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources. The oldest of this group was John Wansbrough (1928‚Äì2002). Wansbrough's works were widely noted, but perhaps not widely read. In 1972 a cache of ancient Qur'ans in a mosque in Sana'a, Yemen was discovered ‚Äì commonly known as the Sana'a manuscripts. The German scholar Gerd R. Puin and his research team, who investigated these Quran fragments for many years, made approximately 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one. Keith Small, in Textual Criticism and Qur‚ÄôƒÅn Manuscripts, has concluded that it is not possible to develop a reliable critical text of the Quran based on the sources currently available.Small, Keith E. (2011). Textual Criticism and Qur‚ÄôƒÅn Manuscripts. Lexington Books. . p. 178 The Corpus Coranicum project is an ongoing effort to develop a critical edition of the Quran. Differences and similarities with the Bible Skeptical scholars account for the many similarities between the Quran and the Jewish and Hebrew Scriptures by saying that Muhammad was teaching what he believed to be a universal history, as he had heard it from the Jews and Christians he had encountered in Arabia and on his travels - as well as his exposure to the Hanif tradition by way of his paternal-grandfather, Abdul Muttalib. These scholars also disagree with the Islamic belief that the whole of the Quran is addressed by God to humankind. They note that there are numerous passages where God is directly addressed, or mentioned in the third person, or where the narrator swears by various entities, including God.Introduction to the Qur'an 2nd Edition, Richard Bell, W. Montgomery Watt, Edinburgh University Press, 1970, , p. 66. The Quranic account, however, differs significantly regarding the crucifixion and death of Jesus. Similarities with Apocryphal legends Aside from the Bible, Quran relies on several Apocryphal and legendary sources, like the Protoevangelium of James,Leirvik 2010, pp. 33‚Äì34. Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, and several infancy gospels.Leirvik 2010, p. 33. Several narratives rely on Jewish Midrash Tanhuma legends, like the narrative of Cain learning to bury the body of Abel in Surah 5:31.Samuel A. Berman, Midrash Tanhuma-Yelammedenu (KTAV Publishing house, 1996) 31-32Gerald Friedlander, Pir·∏≥e de-R. Eliezer, (The Bloch Publishing Company, 1916) 156 Varying codices and the start of the canonization Before Uthman established the canon of the Quran, there may have been different versions or codices in complete state, though none has yet been discovered. Such codices as may exist never gained general approval and were viewed by Muslims as individuals' personal copies. With respect to partial codices, there is opinion that \\"the search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman's alleged recension in the 640s has not yielded any differences of great significance\\".F. E. Peters, The Quest of the Historical Muhammad, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 23, No. 3 (Aug.,1991), p. 293 The two most influential codices at this time are  øAbdullah ibn Mas øud's and Ubayy ibn Ka øb's. Al-Qurazi recounted seeing the mushafs used by Ibn Mas'ud, Ubayy, and Zaid b. Thabit and finding no differences between them.Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami (2003), The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments, p.197. UK Islamic Academy. .  øAbdullah ibn Mas øud's codex The most influential of the allegedly varying codices was that of  øAbdullah ibn Mas øud, an early convert who became a personal servant to Muhammad. It is reported that he learned around seventy suras directly from Muhammad, who appointed him as one of the first teachers of Quranic recitation. Later he was appointed to an administrative post in Kufa by the caliph  øUmar, where he became a leading authority on the Quran and hadith. Some sources suggest that Ibn Mas øud refused to destroy his copy of the Quran or to stop teaching it when the  øUthmanic codex was made official. There are two points on which Ibn Mas øud's version is alleged to differ from the  øUthmanic text: the order of the suras and some variants in the readings. Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami lists three reports concerning the omission of three suras, (Al-Fatiha and Al-Mu'awwidhatayn, the two short suras with which the Quran ends (Suras 113 and 114)), he then states that \\"early scholars such as al-Nawawi and Ibn Hazm denounced these reports as lies fathered upon Ibn Mas'ud.\\"Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami (2003), The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments, pp.199-201. UK Islamic Academy. . Most of the other differences involve only altered vowels with the same consonantal text, which caused variations in recitation. Ubay ibn Ka'b's codex The second most influential codex was that of Ubay ibn Ka'b, a Medinan Muslim who served as a secretary for Muhammad. It is believed that he may have been more prominent as a Quranic specialist than Ibn Mas øud during Mu·∏•ammad's lifetime. There are reports that he was responsible for memorizing certain important revelations on legal matters, which from time to time Muhammad asked him to recite. In a few hadiths, Ubay is seen in a variety of roles. For instance, the \\"sheets\\" of Ubay are sometimes mentioned in some instances instead of those of ·∏§afsa, and sometimes he is also mentioned in some hadiths instead of Zayd, dictating the Quran to scribes. His version of the Quran is said to have included two short suras not in the Uthmanic or Ibn Mas øud texts: S≈´rat al-Khal, with three verses, and S≈´rat al-·∏§afd, with six. The order of suras in Ubayy's codex is said to have differed from that of Uthman's and Ibn Mas øud's as well, although these are structural differences rather than textual variations. The first sura, entitled al-Khal (\\"separation\\"), is translated as: \\"O Allah, we seek your help and ask your forgiveness, and we praise you and we do not disbelieve in you. We separate from and leave him who sins against you.\\" The second sura, entitled al-Hafd (\\"haste\\"), is translated as: \\"O Allah, we worship You and to You we pray and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.\\" These two pieces are said to constitute qunut (that is, supplications which Muhammad sometimes made in morning prayer or in witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran). They are in fact identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadiths. (See Nawawi, al-adhkar, Cairo, 1955, pp. 57‚Äì58.) The single additional so-called aya is translated: \\"If the son of Adam were given a valley full of riches, he would wish a second one; and if he were given two valleys full of riches, he would surely ask for a third. Nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and Allah is forgiving to him who is repentant.\\" This text is known to be a hadith from Muhammad. (Bukhari, VIII, No. 444-47.) According to Ibn 'Abbas (No. 445) and 'Ubay (No. 446) this text was at times thought to be part of the Quran. However, Ubay himself clarifies that after sura 102: \\"I had been revealed, [the sahaba] did not consider the above to be part of the Quran.\\" (Bukhari, VIII, No. 446.) This explanation of Ubay also makes it very clear that the companions of Mohammad did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what was not part of the Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use; that is, in his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since the notebook was not meant for public use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. All companions of Mohammad are said to have had their own copies of the Quran, with notes, for personal use. The Islamic reports of these copies of the Quran of the companions of Mohammad only tell of various differences according to reports that reached them (e.g., the hadith in Bukhari, VIII, No. 446, that Ubay at some early stage held this sentence to be part of the Quran). However, the tangible manuscripts of these copies of the Quran have not survived but were destroyed, having been considered obsolete. Early manuscripts to the final canonical text After Uthman had the other codices destroyed there were still variations in the reading and the text of this Quran. However, scholars deny the possibility of great changes of the text arguing that addition, suppression or alteration would have led to controversy 'of which there is little trace'. They further state that even though Uthman became unpopular among Muslims, he was not charged with alteration or mutilation of the Quran in general.Introduction to the Qur'an, Richard Bell, W. Montgomery Watt, Edinburgh University Press, 1995, , p. 51. During the manuscript age, the Quran was the most copied Arabic text. It was believed that copying the Quran would bring blessings on the scribe and the owner. The Arabic script as we know it today was unknown in Muhammad's time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was preserved through memorization and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible due to the absence of diacritical marks (a'jam). Vowelling marks (tashkil) to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script as we know it today, the scripta plena, which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century. Umayyad Period (44/661‚Äì132/750) ‚Äì Hijazi script The earliest known manuscripts of the Quran are collectively called the Hijazi script, and are mostly associated with the Umayyad period. Most of the fundamental reform to the manuscripts of the Quran took place under Abd al-Malik, the fifth Umayyad caliph (65/685‚Äì86/705). Under Abd al-Malik's reign, Abu'l Aswad al-Du'ali (died 688) founded the Arabic grammar and invented the system of placing large coloured dots to indicate the tashkil. The Umayyad governor al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al- Thaqafi later enforced this system. During this time the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem in 72/691‚Äì92 was done, which was complete with Quranic inscriptions. The inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock in fact represent the earliest known dated passages from the Quran. In these inscriptions, many letters are already provided with diacritical points. The earliest codices of the Quran found in the Umayyad period were most likely made in single volumes, which can be determined from the large fragments that have survived. Also during this time, the format of the codex went from being vertical to horizontal in the 8th century. It is believed this change to horizontal formats and thick/heavy-looking scripts may have been done to show the superiority of the Quran and to distinguish the Islamic tradition from the Jewish and Christian ones, who used vertical formats for their scriptures. During this time, there was a diversity of styles in which the Quran was written. One characteristic seen in most of these manuscripts is the elongated shafts of the free-standing alif and the right-sided tail (foot) of the isolated alif. Also, these manuscripts do not have headings of chapters (suras). Instead, a blank space is left at the end of one sura and at the beginning of another. Abbasid Period (132/750‚Äì640/1258) =Early Abbasid Style= Unlike the manuscripts from the Umayyad Dynasty, many of the early Abbasid manuscripts were copied in a number of volumes. This is evident from the large scripts used and the smaller number of lines per page. Early Quranic manuscripts provide evidence for the history of the Quranic text and their formal features tell us something about the way art and its deeper meaning were perceived in the classical age of Islam. Both its script and layout turned out to be constructed according to elaborate geometrical and proportional rules. The main characteristic of these scripts was their writing style. The letters in most of these manuscripts are heavy-looking, relatively short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a straight shaft with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colours. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened to the rest of the structure with leather thongs. =New Abbasid Style= The New Abbasid Style (NS) began at the end of the 9th century C.E. and was used for copying the Quran until the 12th centuries, and maybe even as late as the 13th century. Unlike manuscripts copied in Early Abbasid scripts, NS manuscripts had vertical formats. During this time, Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al- Farahidi (died 786) devised a tashkil system to replace that of Abu al-Aswad. His system has been universally used since the early 11th century, and includes six diacritical marks: fatha (a), damma (u), kasra (i), sukun (vowel- less), shadda (double consonant), madda (vowel prolongation; applied to the alif). Another central figure during this time was Abu Bakr b. MujƒÅhid (died 324/936). His goal was to restrict the number of reliable readings and accept only those based on a fairly uniform consonantal text. He chose seven well- known Quran teachers of the 2nd/8th century and declared that their readings all had divine authority, which the others lacked. He based this on the popular ·∏•adith in which Muhammad says the Quran was revealed to him in \\"seven a·∏•ruf\\". During this time there was strong Quranic traditions in Kufa, Ba·π£ra, Medina, Damascus, and Mecca. Due to this, Ibn MujƒÅhid selected one reading each for Medina, Mecca, Ba·π£ra, and Damascus‚Äîthose of Nafi‚Äò (died 169/785), Ibn Kathir (died 120/737), Abu  øAmr (died 154/770), and Ibn øAmir (died 118/736), respectively‚Äîand three for K≈´fa, those of  øAsim (died 127/744), ·∏§amza (died 156/772), and al-Kisa æi (died 189/804). His attempt to limit the number of canonical readings to seven was not acceptable to all, and there was strong support for alternative readings in most of the five cities. In the present day the most common reading that is in general use is that of 'Aasim al-Kufi through Hafs. The 11th-century eastern Quranic manuscript contains the 20th juz' (section) of a Quran that originally consisted of 30 parts. The arrangement into 30 parts corresponds to the number of days in the month of Ramadan, during which the Muslim is obliged to fast and to read through the whole of the Quran. Other sections or fragments of this magnificent manuscript lie scattered in various collections all over the world. A Turkish note ascribes the Quran to the hand of the Caliph Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son- in-law, and thus demonstrates the high significance of this manuscript. The text is written in Eastern Kufic, a monumental script that was developed in Iran in the late 10th century. The writing and the illumination of the manuscript bear witness to the great artistic skills of the calligrapher and the illustrator. The manuscript is at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany. Out of seven complete or nearly complete semi-Kufic Qurans from before the end of the eleventh century, four contain a verse count. Although admittedly a small sample, it does suggest that the use of a verse count was a prevalent and quite deeply rooted practice in semi-Kufic Qurans between ca. 950 and ca. 1100. Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla (died 940), an accomplished calligrapher from Baghdad, was also a prominent figure at this time. He became vizir to three Abbasid caliphs and is credited with developing the first script to obey strict proportional rules. Ibn Muqla's system was used in the development and standardization of the Quranic script, and his calligraphic work became the standard way of writing the Quran. However it was later perfected by Ibn al-Bawwab (d. 1022), the master calligrapher who continued Muqla's tradition. Muqla's system became one of the most popular styles for transcribing Arabic manuscripts in general, being favoured for its legibility. The eleventh century Quran is one of the earliest dated manuscripts in this style. This \\"new style\\" is defined by breaks and angular forms and by extreme contrasts between the thick and thin strokes. The script was initially used in administrative and legal documents, but then it replaced earlier Quranic scripts. It is possible that it was easier to read than the early 'Abbasid scripts, which differ greatly from current writing. Economic factors may also have played a part because while the \\"new style\\" was being introduced, paper was also beginning to spread throughout the Muslim world, and the decrease in the price of books triggered by the introduction of this new material seems to have led to an increase in its demand. The \\"new style\\" was the last script to spread throughout the Muslim world before the introduction of printing. It remained in use until the 13th century, at which point it was restricted to titles only. 1924 Cairo edition The influential standard Quran of Cairo (\\"1342 Cairo text\\" using the Islamic calendar) is the Quran that was used throughout almost all the Muslim world until 1985.

Bergstr√§sser was certainly impressed with the work.Reynolds, \\"Quranic studies and its controversies\\", 2008 Completeness Islamic sources Records from Islamic sources suggest that before Caliph Uthman's standardization, after which variants were allegedly burned, the Quran may have contained either 116 chapters (Ubayy Ibn Ka'ab's codex) or 111 chapters (Ibn Ma'sud's codex).As-Suyuti, \\"Al-Itqan\\", pp. 152-153; Arthur Jeffery, Materials for the History of the Text of the Qu'ran: The Old Codices. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1937. Islamic view: Sunni and Shia Most Muslims believe that Quran, as it is presented today, is complete and untouched, supported by their faith in Quranic verses such as \\"We [Allah] have, without doubt, sent down the Reminder [the Quran]; and We will assuredly guard it [from corruption]\\". Due to the varying accounts and hadiths on the collection and canonization of the Quran, some scholars debate whether the Uthmanic text contains the entire body of material that was revealed to Muhammad, or if there is material missing from the text. For example, some Sunni literature contains reports that suggest that some of the revelations had already been lost before the collection of the Quran initiated by Abu Bakr. In one report, 'Umar was once looking for the text of a specific verse of the Quran on stoning as a punishment for adultery, which he remembered. Later, he discovered that the only person who had any record of that verse had been killed in the battle of Yamama and as a result the verse was lost. Some of the Companions recalled that same verse, one person being 'A'isha, Muhammad's youngest wife. She is believed to have said that a sheet on which two verses, including the one on stoning, were under her bedding and that after Muhammad died, a domestic animal got into the room and ate the sheet. Experts on hadith literature have rejected this hadith, as all routes of transmission either contain narrators charged with dishonesty in disclosing sources or simply conflict with the majority version of the report, which all have authentic routes of transmission but omit the part about the piece of paper being eaten.Shu'aib al-Arna\`ut, Tahqiq Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, vol. 6, pg. 269, hadith #26,359. Beirut: Mu\`assasah al-Risalah.Muhammad Taqi Usmani, Takmilat Fath al-Mulhim, vol. 1, pg. 69. Beirut: Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi. Certain Shia scholars state that Ali's predecessors wilfully excluded all references to the right of Ali to be the caliph after Muhammad died. Some Shias questioned the integrity of the Uthmanic codex, stating that two surahs, \\"al-Nurayn\\" (The Two Lights) and \\"al-Walayah\\" (the Guardianship), which dealt with the virtues of Muhammad's family, were removed. Al-Khoei addresses this issue and argues for the authenticity and completeness of the Quran on the basis that it was compiled during the lifetime of Muhammad. His argument is based on hadiths and on critically analysing the situation during and after the life of Muhammad. He states that the collection of the Quran by Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman occurred significantly after the caliphate was decided, and so if Ali's rule had been mentioned, there would have been no need for the Muslims to gather to appoint someone. The fact that none of the Companions mentioned this supposed alteration, either at the beginning of the caliphate or after Ali became caliph, is regarded as proof that this alteration did not occur. Al-Khoei also argues that by the time 'Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread to such an extent that it was impossible for anyone to remove anything from the Quran. Uthman could have altered the text but he would have been unable to convince all those who had memorized the Quran to go along with his alterations. Any such alteration also would have been mentioned by Uthman's political opponents and assassins yet none accused him of this. Finally, he argues that if Uthman had altered the Quran, Ali would have restored it to its original state upon the death of Uthman, especially if verses of his rule had been removed. Instead Ali is seen promoting the Quran during his reign, which is evidence that there was no alteration. Manuscripts In the 20th century, the Sanaa manuscript was discovered. It has been radiocarbon dated to the range 578-669 CE with 95% confidence. The manuscript is a palimpsest with quranic verses in both upper and lower texts. The upper text has exactly the same verses and the same order of suras and verses as the standard Quran.Behnam Sadeghi & Mohsen Goudarzi, \\"Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran\\", Der Islam, 87 (2012), 26. The order of the suras in the lower text of the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Quran.Behnam Sadeghi & Mohsen Goudarzi, \\"Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran\\", Der Islam, 87 (2012), 23. In addition, the lower text exhibits extensive variations from the counterpart text in the standard Quran; such that the lower text represents the only surviving early quranic manuscript that does not conform to the 'Uthmanic tradition. The majority of these variations add words and phrases, so as to emphasize or clarify the standard quranic reading. Some scholars have proposed parallels for these variations in reports of variants in 'companion codices' that were kept by individual companions to the Prophet outside of the mainstream tradition of 'Uthman; but these correspondences are much the minority. Fran√ßois D√©roche proposes, on palaeographic grounds, a date for the lower text in the second half of the first century AH (hence 672 - 722 CE) and summarises the character of the Sana'a Palimpsest, \\"The scriptio inferior of the Codex ·π¢an øƒÅ æ I has been transcribed in a milieu which adhered to a text of the Qur æan different from the  øUthmanic tradition as well as from the Qur æanic codices of Ibn Mas ø≈´d and Ubayy\\".

Retrieved 15 November 2013. and the last Byzantine prefect of Egypt. He died in Alexandria on March 21, 642. Bishop of Phasis In 620 he was appointed Bishop of Phasis in Colchis. In 626 the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, in the course of his Persian campaign, consulted him about a plan for bringing the Miaphysites of Egypt back to the Church, and to the support, of the empire. The monoenergist plan, suggested by Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople, consisted of agreeing on the Chalcedonian principle that there were two natures of Christ, while practically nullifying it by saying he had only one energy, . Cyrus supported this formula after being reassured by Sergius that it was endorsed by Pope Honorius I in Rome and that it was opposed to neither the Fathers nor to Chalcedon and was destined to achieve great result. In return he was raised by Heraclius to the See of Alexandria in 630 in opposition to its Miaphysite Patriarch. Patriach of Alexandria Once a patriarch, Cyrus continued trying to unite Miaphysites and Chalcedonians around monoenergism, now evolving into monotheletism, the idea of one will. In a synod held at Alexandria in June 633, he proposed what is known as the Pact of Union, pl√®rophoria or \\"Satisfactio\\", an agreement in nine articles, the seventh of which is a bold assertion of monothelitism. The Miaphysites (who were also called Theodosians or Severians) welcomed the agreement but remarked that Chalcedon was coming to them, not they to Chalcedon. Thousands of clergy, soldiers and ordinary people converted with Cyrus away from the miaphysite position at this time, but the change did not last. It was hoped that Pope Honorius I would be won over to the monothelete position. Cyrus attended another synod at Cyprus under Arkadios II in 636 along with 45 other senior clergy, at which he served as moderator and permitted Monothelite opponents to submit their case to the Emperor. When Cyrus received the Emperor's Monothelite response, the Ecthesis, Cyrus signed it in 637. Ultimately the monothelete compromise proved ineffective, as it was condemned at the Lateran Council of 649 and soon fell into discredit under the contemptuous name of . Military prefect When Caliph Umar the Great's general, 'Amr ibn al-'As known to the Romans as Amru, threatened the Prefecture of Egypt, Cyrus was made prefect and entrusted with the conduct of the war. Certain humiliating stipulations, to which he subscribed for the sake of peace, angered his imperial master so much that he was recalled and harshly accused of connivance with the Rashidun Caliphate; however, he was soon restored to his former authority, owing to the impending siege of Alexandria, but could not avert the fall of the great city in 640. He signed a peace treaty that surrendered Alexandria and Egypt on 8 November 641 before dying in 642. Writings From Cyrus there are three letters to Sergius and the \\"Satisfactio\\", all preserved in the acts of the Roman Synod of the Lateran and of the Sixth ≈ícumenical Council (Mansi, X, 1004; XI, 560, 562, 964). The first letter is an acceptation of the Ecthesis; in the second Cyrus describes his perplexity between Pope Leo and Sergius; the conversion of the Theodosians is narrated in the third. The seventh article of the \\"Satisfactio\\" ‚Äî the others are irrelevant ‚Äî reads thus: \\"The one and same Christ, the Son, performs the works proper to God and to man by one theandric operation according to St. Dionysius\\". Cyrus' chief opponents, St. Sophronius, died in 638 (Epistola synodica, Mansi, XI, 480), and St. Maximus, died in 662 (Epistola ad Nicandrum; disputatio cum Pyrrho, P.G., XCI, 101, 345), reproached him for falsifying the then much-respected text of Dionysius and substituting for (new). They showed, moreover, the inanity of his claim to the support of the Fathers, and explained how the Divine and human natures of Christ, sometimes styled one, because they belong to the same person and work in perfect harmony, can no more by physically identified than the natures from which they proceed. Historians are not agreed as to how Cyrus came by this. Some think that he was, from the outset, a Monophysite at heart. Others, with more reason, hold that he was led to this belief by Sergius and Heraclius. Cyrus was posthumously condemned as a heretic in the Lateran Council of 649 (Denzinger, Enchiridion, 217, 219) and in 680 at the Third Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (Denzinger, 238; Mansi, XI, 554).

The first port of Ghent was situated at the Scheldt river and later on at the river Leie. Since the Middle Ages Ghent has sought for a connection to the sea. In the 13th century via the Lieve canal to the Zwin near Damme, in the 16th century via the Sassevaart, in the 17th century via the Ghent-Bruges Canal. Since the 19th century by the Ghent‚ÄìTerneuzen Canal which connects via the Western Scheldt to the North Sea. The port of Ghent is accessible by ships of the Panamax size, and in February 2015 the construction of a new lock at Terneuzen was announced, which will maintain near-parity with those of the Panama Canal expansion project. Arcelor Gent History In 1251, the Lieve Canal was constructed in order to attempt to connect Ghent to Damme, which was at that time was situated at the Zwin. However, the Zwin sanded up and the Lieve canal lost all relevance by the end of the fifteenth century. In 1547, a second attempt was made by digging the Sassevaart (Sasse Canal), which became a busy trade route. In the sixteenth century however, the Wars of Religion meant the end of navigation on the Sassevaart. This due to a traffic lock on both Western Scheldt and all other connecting waterways set by the Dutch. In the 17th century, a new attempt was made with the Ghent-Bruges-Ostend canal. But as a consequence of the abolition of the former trade privileges there was but little activity. The present canal(Canal Ghent-Terneuzen) was finally dug under the rule of William I, King of the Netherlands. In 1822 the final plan was ratified and in 1827 the works could be started. As waterborne traffic and port activities increased, the sea canal was extended several times: * 1880 ‚Äì 1881: digging of the Voorhaven and Houtdok * 1900 ‚Äì 1930: digging of the Grootdok with the Noord-, Midden- and Zuiddok * 1931: digging of the Schepen Sifferdok The works on the Sifferdok were complicated by the crisis of the thirties and by World Wars I and II. A revival was practically impossible as the dimensions of the lock were insufficient for the modern post-war seagoing vessels. In 1960 an agreement was signed between Belgium and the Netherlands, which stipulated that a new sealock was to be built and that the Canal was to be adapted for vessels up to . now one post-panamax vessel has already managed to pass through the existing lock.her name was alam permai with a deadweight of 87000 tonnes * 1961 ‚Äì 1968: lengthening of the Sifferdok * 1966 ‚Äì 1968: digging of the Petroleumdok * 1968: inauguration of the new sealock * 1970 ‚Äì 1971/1975 ‚Äì 1978: digging of the Rodenhuizedok * 1996 ‚Äì today: digging of the Kluizendok With the digging of the newest dock, the Kluizendok, a new era dawned for Ghent. The first phase of the works was scheduled for completion in the autumn of 1999. From that moment onwards the first 1,200m of quay wall and waterfront sites behind became available. In 2005 it the Kluizendok became partially operational. It includes 100 hectares directly fronting the dockside, suitable for logistics and industrial developments, and a further 100 hectares suitable for manufacturing and assembly industries without a direct interface to maritime transport. In February 2015 Flanders and the Netherlands signed a treaty for the construction of a new lock at Terneuzen, scheduled for completion in 2021 and costing ‚Ç¨920M. The new lock is about the same size as those of the contemporaneous expansion project of the Panama Canal.

Early life He was born in London, England and moved to Australia when he was 5 and grew up in Sydney. He graduated from law school, moved to Melbourne and married Louise Giselle Baron in 1976. He joined the board of Emma Page, a fashion jewellery concern, in 1981. He spent the years from 1985 to 1989 in Austin, Texas, working full-time for Emma Page. In 1991, Green became a partner of Gary Vernon Shugg, in a law firm in Melbourne. Green left this firm in late 1993. In 1995, a partner of the firm (Shugg) was suspended from practice for three years. It was alleged, but never proved, that the firm sold weapons to Cambodia. The firm was placed into receivership in June 1994 at the request of Shugg. Green became a partner in Melbourne law firm Aroni Colman shortly after his departure from Shugg & Green. Tax minimisation Australian tax law allows equipment purchases that are below a certain purchase price to be entirely depreciated in the first year. Green founded an investment scheme during the 1990s designed to help investors minimise tax legally. The scheme would buy equipment and lease it to CityLink for the construction of highways in Melbourne. The scheme involved borrowing four times as much money as the initial capital from a Hong Kong bank. A$42 million was invested in the scheme, mainly by private individuals. Most of the investors were Jewish businessmen from Melbourne. Green promised a 15% per annum return on investment, as well as allowing investors to legally write off some of the investment as a tax deduction. Green created fraudulent documents that appeared to show equipment purchases, but the fund never actually purchased any equipment and CityLink did not lease any equipment from it. A considerable quantity of money disappeared from the trust accounts used to hold the investors' capital. The movement of the money was subsequently traced through an elaborate network of bank accounts. However, Green ultimately laundered all the money that he stole and police were never able to recover any of it. It is thought that he purchased some US $20 million of gems from various gem traders in Cambodia, and later sold the gems in Israel. The Victorian Lawyers RPA Ltd, the regulatory arm of the Victorian Law Institute, began an investigation of \\"trust account irregularities\\" in accounts associated with Green and Aroni Colman. Quotes His friend and associate Ted Doyle, a gem trader, said \\"A very fine piece of monofilament was attaching Max Green to the planet.

It is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm designed to simultaneously provide both authentication and privacy of the message (authenticated encryption) with a two-pass scheme, one pass for achieving privacy and one for authenticity for each block. EAX mode was submitted on October 3, 2003 to the attention of NIST in order to replace CCM as standard AEAD mode of operation, since CCM mode lacks some desirable attributes of EAX and is more complex. Encryption and authentication EAX is a flexible nonce-using two-pass AEAD scheme with no restrictions on block cipher primitive to be used, nor on block size, and supports arbitrary-length messages. Authentication tag length is arbitrarily sizeable up to the used cipher's block size. The block cipher primitive is used in CTR mode for encryption and as OMAC for authentication over each block through the EAX composition method, that may be seen as a particular case of a more general algorithm called EAX2 and described in The EAX Mode of Operation The reference implementation in the aforementioned paper uses AES in CTR mode for encryption combined with AES OMAC for authentication. Performance Being a two-pass scheme, EAX mode is slower than a well designed one-pass scheme based on the same primitives. EAX mode has several desirable attributes, notably: * provable security (dependent on the security of the underlying primitive cipher); * message expansion is minimal, being limited to the overhead of the tag length; * using CTR mode means the cipher need be implemented only for encryption, in simplifying implementation of some ciphers (especially desirable attribute for hardware implementation); * the algorithm is \\"on-line\\", that means that can process a stream of data, using constant memory, without knowing total data length in advance; * the algorithm can pre- process static Associated Data (AD), useful for encryption/decryption of communication session parameters (where session parameters may represent the Associated Data). Notably, CCM mode lacks the last 2 attributes (CCM can process Associated Data, it can't pre-process it). Patent status The authors of EAX mode, Mihir Bellare, Phillip Rogaway, and David Wagner placed the work under public domain and have stated that they were unaware of any patents covering this technology. Thus, EAX mode of operation is believed to be free and unencumbered for any use. Use A modification of the EAX mode, so called EAX‚Ä≤ or EAXprime, is used in the ANSI C12.22 standard for transport of meter-based data over a network. In 2012 Kazuhiko Minematsu, Stefan Lucks, Hiraku Morita and Tetsu Iwata published a paper that proves the security of the mode with messages longer than the key, but demonstrates a trivial attack against short messages using this mode. It is not possible to create vulnerable short messages compliant with the ANSI C12.22 standard, but in other contexts in which such short messages are possible, EAXprime cannot be securely used.

But it can be danced at any special occasion. Often it is performed by a small group of girls, up to 10 or so. It can also be performed individually as well. It is rare for a married, or any older woman to dance it. It is even rarer, but not impossible, to be performed by men. However, men can assist the dancing girl by mimicking her movements in an exaggerated and clownesque way, which is supposed to make her beauty more striking. The assistance of older women is usually limited to only handclaps on the rhythm of the music. This role is called the tuulafale. It is usual for a girl to start the dance, then parents, cousins, family members or friends come on the stage to put money notes on her oiled skin, and then join her in the tuulafale. The prizemoney (fakapale) is a reward for the girl, unless, as often is the case, the dance is performed as part of a fundraising. The tauolunga mainly consists of a series of hand movements, which interpret the meaning of the selected song. However, most of the movements are so stylised that only adepts will understand them. Many of the typical gestures (haka) are standardised and have their own name. Also important is the movement of the head. The head with the eyes should follow the hands on important movements, otherwise they are to be directed to the public. The eyes are never to glance away. From time to time, little nods within one beat (teki) or two beats (kalo) must be made with the head. The girl must smile all the time. The movements of the body and the legs are less important. They have to follow hands and head. Shaking the hips, as elsewhere in Polynesia, is forbidden. Most of the time the legs are standing still, knees must be together and bent (taulalo). Some small steps, never large, or a turn around can be performed. Overall, the girl's movements should be supple and soft, as should be her whole body. A unique feature of any Tongan dance, not found elsewhere in Polynesia, is the rotational movements of the hands and wrists in many of the haka. Dress A tauolunga girl is usually dressed in a wrap around dress, either made from ngatu with traditional designs; a mat (kie) from handwoven pandanus leaves; a piece of cloth covered with green leaves, grass, fragrant flowers or shells; any shiny piece of cloth, decorated with sewn-on traditional patterns; or even a grass skirt. Every type of costume (teunga) has its own proper name. The dress reaches from just above the breasts down to the knees, leaving her arms and legs bare. As long skirts are the traditional apparel for Tongan girls, this is an occasion to show off her legs. If they are fair, the better. Putting oil on her exposed skin parts so that they shine enhances her beauty even more in the Tongan mind. Around her middle she wears a belt (kafa) also usually made from leaves and fragrant flowers. Wristlets and anklets (vesa) may be worn, ranging from simple bands of cloth or ngatu to elaborate belts of leaves and flowers again. Around her neck she wears a black ribbon with a white cowry shell on it (puleoto). By tradition, if the shell is missing, then she is not a virgin. In practice, no girl does it without a shell. On her head she wears a little crown (tekiteki), which will enhance her head movements during the dance, consisting of feathers or some light plant material. The more natural materials are used for her whole dress the better it is. Unfortunately plastic is slowly making its inroads nowadays. History Many technical motifs of the tauolunga are derived from the ancient Tongan ula / faahi-ula / fahaiula. The original ula was a group dance of young chiefly daughters who, on the rhythm of a quite monotonous song, made a series of postures beautiful to look at. The formalization of the dance as a distinct genre followed the introduction of the Samoan \\"taualuga\\" during the early 19th century and its institution among Tongan aristocratic circles (especially those associated with the Tu'i Kanokupolu lineages). The postures originally emphasized finger and hand motifs (following Samoan stylistics), until 1950 when queen SƒÅlote personally integrated the distinctly Tongan wrist flourishes and lakalaka leg transitions into her song \\"Manu o Palataisi\\" (Bird of Paradise), leading to the technical composition and format of the contemporary Tongan tauolunga.

In 2007, residents of the cottage flats in the area were told they would not be entitled to the substantial council tax refunds which had been awarded to householders in almost identical properties in neighbouring Croftfoot, as theirs was considered a more affluent part of the city and consequently the higher payment 'band' applied was correct.The ¬£1m Council Tax blunder, Evening Times, 22 November 2007 The district was named after the medium-sized park of the same name (68 acres in size) which lies within its boundariesKing‚Äôs Park History, Glasgow City CouncilKing's Park, Gazetteer for Scotland and is also spotted with further green areas rather than entirely built upon.

Foundation and early years The Taganrog Theater was established in 1827 by governor Alexander Dunaev. The theater was subsidized by the Taganrog's City Council since 1828, and its first director was Alexander Gor. The first group of Russian drama artists was directed by Perovsky and toured around the region, giving performances in Rostov on Don, Novocherkassk, Bahmut. The repertoire consisted mainly of dramas, melodramas and vaudevilles. Italian opera Since 1861, Italian opera regularly performed in Taganrog. In 1865 was created a stock company to finance the construction of the new theater building. Forty-five thousand silver rubles of stocks were issued, for the total budget of 55,000 rubles. In 1866, Taganrog established its very own Italian opera in a new opera theater building by the project of the architect Londeron from Odessa. The interiors of the theater were designed after the image of the Milano opera theater La Scala. The repertoire of that time included Giuseppe Verdi, Gioachino Rossini, Jacques Offenbach, Vincenzo Bellini, Mikhail Glinka, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and others. In 1874, the Taganrog Municipality acquired the theater building by the purchase of its stocks. The newly established theater commission decided to dissolve the Italian opera in 1875 for commercial reasons. One of the Taganrog Italian opera's directors and choirmasters - Gaetano Molla - stayed in Taganrog after the opera theater was closed and contributed to promotion and development of music culture in the city of Taganrog. Young Anton Chekhov in the theater Anton Chekhov who was born in Taganrog in 1860 was in love with theater and literature from his childhood. The first performance that he attended was Offenbach's operette Elena the Beautiful onstage Taganrog City Theater on October 4, 1873. Anton was a 13-year-old Gymnasium student, and from that moment on, Chekhov became a great theater lover and spent there virtually all his savings. His favorite seat in the theater was at the back gallery for it was cheap (40 silver kopeks), and because Gymnasium students needed a special authorisation to go to the theater. The permission was given not often and mostly for the weekends. Sometimes, Anton Chekhov and other fellow students disguised themselves and even wore some makeup, spectacles or a fake beard, trying to fool the regular school staff who checked for unauthorized presence of students. Later years In 1901, the first movie was shown onstage Taganrog City Theater. In 1935, during the 75th Anniversary Celebrations of Anton Chekhov's birthday, the famous artists of the Moscow Art Theater performed onstage of Taganrog Theater: Olga Knipper, Tarasova, Vishnevskaya, Moskvin and others. In 1944, the Soviet of People's Commissars of USSR named the Taganrog City Theater after Anton Pavlovich Chekhov. In 1960, the artists of Taganrog Chekhov Drama Theater performed onstage of the Kremlin Palace of Congress in Moscow within the framework of the centennial celebrations of Anton Chekhov's birthday. In 1965, the Chekhov Drama Theater was praised in the Moscow THEATRE magazine for outstanding production of the Chekhov\`s play Ivanov, starring Petr Shelokhonov in the leading role. In 1977, the theater was decorated with the Order of Honor (Russian Federation). Since 1980, the theater festival In the Birthplace of Anton Chekhov () has been held with participation of theaters from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Italy, Croatia, Spain, Australia, Belarus, Germany and Japan. In 2002 and in 2010, the theater performed at the International Literary & Musical Forum in Badenweiler, Germany, staging Anton Chekhov's Proposal and The Wood Demon.Taganrog Theater Performs On German Stage In October 2006, the theater participated at the 1st International Blacksea Theater Festival in Nikolaev, Ukraine.

Beck died suddenly in 1973. The character of Walker was one of the seven primary characters in the show. Following his character's departure (Walker was last mentioned in the episode \\"The Recruit\\", although he does not appear in this episode) the series attempted to replace him with a war reporter called Private Cheeseman (played by Talfryn Thomas), who had made a previous cameo appearance in the episode \\"My British Buddy\\". Personality Walker is the second-youngest member of the platoon, the youngest being Private Pike, and speaks with a cockney accent. A pleasant and amiable (if slightly shifty) personality, Walker is nevertheless a constant thorn in Captain Mainwaring's side, for he doesn't share Mainwaring's idealism, and makes cheeky and witty interruptions during his serious lectures. However, despite this he is good-natured and loyal to his commanding officer and platoon comrades, and is a valuable asset to the platoon, owing to his many \\"business\\" connections and his ability to mysteriously conjure up almost anything that, due to the War, is rationed or no longer in the shops‚Äîand he will also have it in vast supply (for a price). Walker also demonstrates keen improvisational skills and cunning; as a result, owing to these attributes and his cheerful willingness to use tactics that Mainwaring might not consider to be 'cricket', he is usually responsible for getting the platoon out of many of the scrapes that they find themselves in. He is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to make a few bob, and can normally be found trying to sell such things as petrol coupons and black market foodstuffs to his platoon comrades, usually at high prices and from dubious sources. His \\"business\\" activities are not limited to just the members of the platoon, or indeed even to the residents of Walmington-on-Sea, as he has often made reference to acquiring \\"essential supplies\\" for members of the rival Eastgate platoon and various influential people, military or civilian; at one point, he offers to provide \\"a couple of bottles of scotch\\" to a high- ranking GHQ officer, when Mainwaring briefly loses his command of the platoon. Indeed, the only time Walker can't find a buyer for his \\"essential supplies\\" is when the American Army arrives at Walmington-on-Sea (with the comparatively well-off American troops already having plenty of liquor and other items normally provided by Walker). Walker considers himself a ladies' man; an early episode showed Walker entering an unknown woman's house at night and departing the next morning. In the episode \\"War Dance\\", he brings twin sisters as his dates to a dance Mainwaring is hosting. Walker also has a recurring girlfriend named Shirley/Edith (played by Wendy Richard), who is seen in several episodes. In the platoon, he mostly associates with Lance Corporal Jones, Pike and Frazer. Despite merely being a Private, Walker clearly has some form of influence over the platoon, not least due to his black-market dealings which have got them out of (and into) numerous scrapes. Moreover, when Private Frazer is temporarily promoted to Captain in \\"If the Cap Fits...\\", he selects Walker as his Sergeant. Walker has friendly relationships with all the men in the platoon, jokingly referring to the Scottish Frazer as \\"Taffy\\", and occasionally calling Jones a \\"silly old duffer\\" when they have the odd disagreement. While often exasperating Mainwaring with his constant quips and irreverent attitude towards the war in general and the platoon in particular, on one occasion (in the episode \\"Sons of the Sea\\") Mainwaring praises Walker's \\"lively sense of cockney humour\\" and for keeping his cool under stress (to which a surprised Walker stammers that he was \\"only trying to keep people cheerful\\"). At times, Walker even expresses a sentimental sense of fondness for Mainwaring and others in the platoon, telling Frazer (in the episode \\"Absent Friends\\") that he was bothered by seeing Mainwaring upset after the platoon chose to stay in the pub playing darts instead of going on parade. In the same episode, he tells Frazer to leave Godfrey alone when the latter decides to go back on parade instead of staying in the pub with the others; he expresses similar sentiments in the episode \\"Branded\\" when Godfrey is set to be kicked out of the platoon due to his being a conscientious objector during the First World War, referring to Godfrey as a \\"nice old bloke\\". Walker even dwells on the concept of Jones potentially leaving a fellow soldier to die in the episode \\"The Two and a Half Feathers\\", to the point that it interrupts his makeout session with his girlfriend. In Battle of the Giants!, Walker recounts a story of being awarded a medal of the Sacred Order of the Golden Kris of Abu Dhabi by a Sheikh staying in a hotel on Park Lane, London who was very grateful for Walker's efforts fixing him \\"up with a bird\\". He is supposedly allergic to corned beef, and this is given as the reason why he has not been called up for the regular army, although it is generally assumed that he has found a way to dodge the rules. This allergy was exposed in the episode The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker, which has since been lost from the BBC's archives. He was conscripted, only to be discharged when it was found that corned beef fritters were the only rations left for the soldiers to eat. Walker's final appearance was in the episode Things That Go Bump in the Night, where the platoon spent the night in a mysterious house. In fact he is only seen in the location shots, filmed some time before the studio recording. Beck was ill for the recordings of both this episode and the next episode, The Recruit, in which Walker had \\"gone up to the smoke\\" (a slang term for London) to \\"do a deal\\". After Beck's death, Walker was never mentioned in the show again (though the character survived the war; the very first episode begins with a scene set in 1968, as Mainwaring‚Äînow an alderman‚Äîlaunches his \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" campaign, and Walker is seen as one of the town worthies present at the launch). In the radio adaptations of the series, Graham Stark stood in until Larry Martyn gave his portrayal of Walker for subsequent shows. John Bardon played Walker in the stage production in 1976. Scriptwriter Jimmy Perry originally intended to play the part himself, but was advised against it by his co-writer David Croft. Walker was based on a spiv character created and performed by British comedian and actor Arthur English (English was in the controversial episode \\"Absent Friends\\", and starred in Are You Being Served?).

It is held annually during a weekend in mid-January over a period of two days. Since the test is held in the middle of winter, snow can delay the exam in some regions, but typically the test starts and ends near the same exact time throughout the entire nation. The Center Test has become something of a national phenomenon in Japan, with television coverage and newspapers publishing test questions. To many test-takers in Japan, the test is the difference between college entrance and one year's study for the next year's exams as a r≈çnin. Since the test is only administered annually and entrance to top-ranked universities and colleges is so competitive in Japan, the test has become the subject of scrutiny by many. In addition, rules for tardiness and absences are extremely strict and always result in the forfeit of the right to take the exams, as there are no \\"makeup\\" sessions or re-takes offered except in cases such as delays caused by broken train signals. The test is administered by National Center for University Entrance Examinations, an Independent Administrative Institution (IAI). The National Center Test superseded the Common first-stage exam (ÂÖ±ÈÄö‰∏ÄÊ¨°, ky≈çts≈´ ichiji), which was administered from 1979 to 1989, letting private universities use the test scores as a criterion for admissions decisions. In 2012, the test was held on 14 and 15 January, with around 555,500 students participating (down by 3,400 students from 2011). The test was held at 709 locations across the country and will be used by 835 public universities, private universities and junior colleges to grade applicants.http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/two-day- university-entrance-examinations-begin-across-japan Retrieved 2012-2-23 In 2014, on 19 and 20 January, 560,672 students participated at 693 centers. > \\"As in previous years, there were a few glitches.

Designation  The official name in Japanese is , but this designation is rarely used. It is often called , or simply by test-takers and teachers.  Function  Some universities decide on successful candidates using only the National Center Test, but most prestigious universities require the candidate to take another, institution-specific exam, which is often more difficult than the National Center Test. The function of the Center Test depends on the institution, but most can be categorised into the following three types: * Center Test only: Universities that require only the Center Test results and use only them for admissions decisions. Mostly used by private universities alongside normal (using institution-specific exams) admission. * Center Test and secondary exam: Universities using the Center Test and a secondary exam (their own test, or an essay or interview) for their decisions. Used by most national universities. * Center Test as primary decision: Universities using the Center Test as a primary decision, after which the successful candidates are placed on an even plane and are given a secondary, institution-specific exam that decides admission. Used by the most prestigious universities such as the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University, but not seen much elsewhere.  Checking scores  Because candidates do not know their Center Test scores before applying to universities, most write their answers on the question sheets (which can be taken home) and check their answers using rubrics published by cram schools. A number of cram schools and other companies have services to which candidates can send their scores and learn their overall position relative to other users of the service, called . Candidates can use this information to see how they fared as compared with other test-takers and make their final application decisions. (In Japan, candidates may be unable to apply to all their desired universities, as in countries such as the United States, mainly because the secondary exams are scheduled on or near the same day.)  Tests  Booklets of questions given to test takers (2007). There are separate tests for each subject, and each is multiple choice. The tests follow the curriculum guidelines published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. There are a total of 30 tests in six subjects. Candidates take the subjects specified by their university. As an exception, however, candidates for the English (written) exam must take the English (listening).  First day  In 2020, the first day of exams was held on Saturday, January 18. * Geography, History and Civics: Candidates select 2 or 1 tests, not including the same name. 100 points each, 60 minutes each ** World History A (‰∏ñÁïåÂè≤A) ** World History B (‰∏ñÁïåÂè≤B) ** Japanese History A (Êó•Êú¨Âè≤A) ** Japanese History B (Êó•Êú¨Âè≤B) ** Geography A (Âú∞ÁêÜA) ** Geography B (Âú∞ÁêÜB) ** Contemporary Social Studies (Áèæ‰ª£Á§æ‰ºö) ** Ethics (ÂÄ´ÁêÜ) ** Politics and Economics (ÊîøÊ≤ª„ÉªÁµåÊ∏à) ** Ethics, Politics and Economics (ÂÄ´ÁêÜ„ÄÅÊîøÊ≤ª„ÉªÁµåÊ∏à) * Japanese Literature: 200 points (Passages written in and after modern period 100 points, Classical Japanese 50 points, Kanbun 50 points), 80 minutes ** Japanese Literature (ÂõΩË™û) * Foreign Languages (written): 200 points each, 80 minutes ** English (Ëã±Ë™û) ** German („Éâ„Ç§„ÉÑË™û) ** French („Éï„É©„É≥„ÇπË™û) ** Chinese (‰∏≠ÂõΩË™û) ** Korean (ÈüìÂõΩË™û) * Foreign Languages (listening): 50 points, 60 minutes (Explanation of process and equipment 30 minutes, testing time 30 minutes).

An IC player was handed out to all candidates of the exam, and a whole 30 minutes of testing time was devoted to the explanation of usage of this device. There was some controversy surrounding the introduction of this exam, and critics doubted the reliability of this device. In 2006, there were 497 (about 0.09%) cases in which candidates had to be given re-tests because of device failure.NikkeiBP.jp „Çª„É≥„Çø„ÉºË©¶È®ì„ÅÆIC„Éó„É¨„Éº„É§Ë™§‰ΩúÂãïÔºå3„Å§„ÅÆÊ§úÊüª„Çí„Åô„ÇäÊäú„Åë„Çã (IC players malfunction in Center Shiken, passing through 3 tests [unnoticed]) http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/NEWS/20060123/112571/ Since the IC players could be taken home, candidates around Japan disassembled the devices at home, finding that the players used Sony's Memory Stick for storage of the exam. Although no note of the manufacturer was made in either the media or on the device itself, the use of this storage format led most to believe that Sony was the manufacturer. The memory stick from a sample device provided to an examination supervisor prior to the 2007 examinations, containing a full sample audio test, contained four files with the .bin file extension. A cursory attempt to extract the content of these files failed and changing the file extension to common audio formats, such as .wav, .mp3, and .wma also did not result in playable files. The total size of all four files was 4.63MB, and the total listening time of 30 minutes makes it obvious that the audio tracks are highly compressed. Additionally, the non-intuitive sequence of buttons needed to operate the player raises concern over the possibility of candidates having difficulty operating the player under test conditions. The inability to stop and restart the audio tracks seems probably due to a wish to ensure that all candidates complete all the listening within the test period. Of even more concern is that the memory stick on the sample player was exposed and could be removed by candidates, leaving open the possibility that candidates may inadvertently remove the memory stick during the test and render the player inoperable.

It is best known for its football team, A.C. ChievoVerona, which competes in the second tier of Italian professional football, Serie B. History The name came from the Latin \\"clivium mantici\\" which means \\"the hill of the magic wood\\". Pastoral and farming activities date back to pre-Roman Celtic settlers. Placed on the shores of the river Adige the early inhabitants established a port, some mills and a water-powered saw on the river. Pipin, son of Charles, gifted the entire zone to the monastery of St. Procolo, near S. Zeno in Verona. In the 12th century Chievo had a church, a hospital and a stronghold in which Federico Barbarossa spent some nights. The Corte Bionde is the best preserved medieval building. Around 1450 the entire village was moved about nearer to the city where the climate was healthier and vegetation more gorgeous. The actual parish church with a reliquary was built at that time. In 1892 the ten church bells were cast, and are still rung today in the style of the Veronese bellringing art.

He is frequently referred to by Captain Mainwaring as \\"stupid boy\\". In the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army he was portrayed by Ian Lavender.  Personality  Pike was born in 1922, and is the youngest of the Walmington-on-Sea platoon. Aged 17 when the series begins, he is not old enough to join the army, although presumably he has reached, or is nearing, his 18th birthday when he is about to receive call-up papers in When You've Got to Go; in the event, it is revealed that he has a rare blood type that excludes him from military service. In \\"War Dance\\", it is revealed to Mainwaring from Wilson that Pike \\"is going on 19\\". He lives in the shadow of his bossy and over-protective mother, Mavis Pike, who is in a relationship with Sergeant Wilson, referred to by Pike as \\"Uncle Arthur\\", who is hinted to be Pike's father. If so, he also has an older half-sister by Wilson's estranged wife. (The writers, Jimmy Perry and David Croft, confirmed after the series that Wilson was Pike's father. This was also revealed in the radio series (and sequel to Dad's Army) It Sticks Out Half a Mile where Mainwaring meets Wilson in the branch at Frambourne, where Wilson is the manager. On chatting to Wilson, he says \\"And how's your son?\\" Wilson laughs in an embarrassed tone and says that he has left the bank and is now an Under Manager at Woolworths. Wilson's tone shows that he must be the father and Mainwaring's question shows that he knows the truth.) His mother is supposedly a widow; it is unclear if there ever really was a Mr Pike, as he is never clearly mentioned. Pike often threatens to set his mum on either Captain Mainwaring or Sergeant Wilson if he is shouted at or forced to do something. Although naive, Pike is aware something is going on with his mother and Wilson: :Pike: \\"By the time we finish supper, it's always so late, you never leave our house until after I've gone to bed and then you're back early for breakfast before I'm awake. But what I can't understand is that I never hear you leave at night and I never hear you come back in.\\" :Wilson: \\"Well I let myself in and out very quietly\\" :Pike: \\"You don't do anything else very quietly!\\" Early in series 1, Pike shows some mild romantic attraction to Janet King, Mainwaring's secretary, when he talks to her about his guard duties. In \\"War Dance\\", Pike becomes engaged to an Army girl called Violet Gibbons who works in a fish and chip shop, but the engagement is called off. Later on, Pike starts seeing a young cinema girl called Ivy, who speaks so quietly that nobody can ever hear her say anything. He briefly develops a crush on Hodges's niece Sylvia, but that quickly fizzles out. In \\"The Royal Train\\", it is revealed that Pike can drive a steam locomotive, having learned to do so at the Schoolboys' Exhibition. Pike is naive and acts childishly; he has limited grasp of adult issues. He is frequently found with confectionery, is upset in \\"The Big Parade\\" to leave a cinema early because \\"I haven't seen the Donald Duck yet\\" and can be petulant to superiors. This annoys Captain Mainwaring, who refers to him as a \\"stupid boy\\" due to his carelessness and mistakes and his bouts of childish humor. In \\"Gorilla Warfare\\", Mainwaring opines that Pike is \\"slightly retarded\\". Mainwaring treats Pike as a child, sometimes threatening to send him home from meetings if he does not behave. Mainwaring also treats Pike as a dogsbody, and gives him menial, demeaning, dangerous or undignified tasks, refusing to \\"mollycoddle\\" him. Pike frequently ends up wet, covered in mud or otherwise humiliated. In \\"Things that Go Bump in the Night\\", he is stripped several times and has to run naked through a field to escape dogs. Pike does however sometimes show some maturity. In \\"Menace from the Deep\\", when Pike has lost all the food brought out to the pier by not tying up the boat correctly, he apologizes to each member of the platoon on the pier. In the episode \\"Something Nasty in the Vault\\", he refuses to leave the bank (and his \\"Uncle Arthur\\") when it is discovered that Wilson and Mainwaring are precariously cradling an unexploded German bomb in the bank's vault. Although Pike comes up with sensible solutions to problems encountered by the platoon, he treats \\"everything as if it's a game\\", to quote Mainwaring in \\"All is Safely Gathered In\\". Notably, in \\"The Deadly Attachment\\", Pike is put on an ominous 'list' by a German U-Boat captain due to Mainwaring's incompetence at preventing the German from learning Pike's name (\\"Don't tell him, Pike!\\"), spelling his doom should the Germans win the war; however, as Pike had sung a childish song about Adolf Hitler in front of this officer, it is his own fault in refusing to take the situation seriously. He would rather play at being a Chicago gangster with the platoon's grenades or Tommy gun. He exasperates Mainwaring but he is humoured by other members, particularly Lance Corporal Jones, Private Godfrey and Private Walker. Pike is one of the most timid members of the group, but was the first in the series to fire on a suspected enemy in \\"The Enemy Within the Gates\\" even though it turned out to be a swan. Pike appears sickly and unhealthy, though most of his \\"illnesses\\" stem from his mother's protectiveness. She usually makes him wears a claret and blue scarf with his Home Guard uniform, which supposedly prevents him from getting croup, even though only infants and (apparently) chickens are supposed to get it (\\"Menace from the Deep\\"). Despite all this, in the episode \\"When You've Got to Go\\", he is certified fit for military service and is set to enter the RAF (to his mother's horror). However, after donating blood during a blood drive, it is discovered that Pike has an extremely rare blood type and he ends up being excluded from active service (though in typical Pike fashion, he doesn't reveal this to the rest of the platoon until after they've given him a going- away party). Pike is a fan of the cinema and narrates the plots of films that relate to the platoon, even if the relationship is vague. When the film example does mirror reality, he picks scenarios which end in death. Pike makes pointless comments while trying to help: this is illustrated in \\"Absent Friends\\". Jones, Mainwaring, Pike and Wilson are searching for an escaped convict, with the help of the police. :Jones: \\"Perhaps they're hidin' behind the bushes, sir. They do a lot of hidin' behind bushes, do policemen. Especially when they're knockin' people off.\\" :Mainwaring: \\"I don't think that's very likely, Jones.\\" :Pike: \\"In that film, 'Public Enemy Number One', they hid behind cars. But there aren't any here.\\" Pike's name is a reference to the spear-like weapons issued to the Home Guard in 1942, generating \\"an almost universal feeling of anger and disgust from the ranks\\".Home Guard Pike Ian Lavender was invited to choose Pike's scarf from the BBC costume department. As a supporter of Aston Villa, he chose the team's colours. A series of Barclays Bank adverts featured Arthur Lowe as George Mainwaring retiring from his position at the bank, with Pike taking over as manager; Mainwaring refers to Pike as 'stupid boy' as he did in the series.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKgKGTA5hc8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI-4JCxuvlo References Category:Dad's Army characters Category:Fictional British Army personnel Category:Television characters introduced in 1968 ","title":"Private Pike"},{"id":"4260352","text":"Action Biker (also known as KP Skips Action Biker with Clumsy Colin in the UK) is a 1985 game for the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum released by Mastertronic. The game was a tie-in with snack food KP Skips, whose mascot was \\"Clumsy Colin\\" who featured in television adverts for Skips at around the time the game was published. In the UK, KP Skips ran a promotion on the back of their crisp packets whereby consumers could claim the C64 or ZX Spectrum game if they posted 10 (or so) empty crisp packets to them in an envelope, along with a cheque for the tiny value of 38 pence. Although marketed under the same title, the ZX Spectrum version of Action Biker differs significantly from the Atari and C64 versions, to the extent that Retro Gamer magazine featured it in their \\"Same Name, Different Game\\" column. The music was composed by C64 game musician Rob Hubbard. Gameplay The isometric view seen in the C64 version. The player controls the protagonist Clumsy Colin who rides a motorbike and has to navigate a landscape to extra equipment to improve the bike. Once all pieces are collected the player performs a final drag race. There is a time limit, and the player also has a limited number of lives reduced by crashing into background objects. The Atari and Commodore 64 versions feature an isometric view of the town, which wraps around at the edges.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=004&page=040&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 The Spectrum has a different viewpoint. There are several key areas to the map: the petrol station (where the player can refuel), the lakes (including an island that is initially inaccessible), the rollercoaster (which can be ridden on the C64 and Atari versions) and the building site (which changes shape as the game progresses). Among the extras collected are a new gearbox (allowing the player to switch to low gear for higher acceleration), water-skis or a snorkel (to allow the player to cross water) and a larger fuel tank.  ZX Spectrum version  ZX Spectrum screenshot Although the Spectrum version shares the basic gameplay elements of navigating a motorbike around a scrolling city and collecting objects with the Atari and C64 versions, it is otherwise significantly different in both plot and execution. The aim of this version, according to the instructions is to \\"find [Colin's] friend Marti and take him to the spaceport\\". Items helping him do this can be found inside houses around the city. However \\"the alarm is set to go off at 8 o'clock and wake him up\\", and Colin will also \\"wake up\\" if he collides with other vehicles. While it may be implied that the game- including the otherwise incongruous \\"spaceport\\" reference- takes place within Colin's dream, the instructions do not explicitly state this. Further, actually picking up Martin in the game gives a message that he should be taken to the \\"airport\\", not the spaceport.

It is a high-level hollow box girder bridge. It is located about a mile from the river mouth. The bridge spans , is at its highest point and weighs 62,000 tons. The bridge connects the A3025 Portsmouth Road to Southampton. It was built to replace the former chain ferry, known as the Floating Bridge, that crossed the river at that point. The bridge's set of blue energy-saving lights can be seen from up to down Southampton Water from the bridge. History Prior efforts The first attempt to build a crossing below Northam Bridge began in 1833. The plan for a 17-arch swing bridge was stopped by the Admiralty over concerns on the effects it would have on navigation. Instead the Woolston Floating Bridge was built which opened in 1836. In 1926, in the context of the construction of the Queensway Tunnel under the River Mersey, Southampton council hired Basil Mott to investigate the various options for building a fixed crossing across the lower River Itchen. Along with providing costs for a tunnel and a high level crossing he recommended a low level opening span bridge. Another planning effort was undertaken in 1936. The full report took two years to compile and included sinking boreholes into the Itchen. Again a low level crossing with a swinging section was the preferred option. Attempts to raise funds for this bridge were delayed by the need to carry out work on Northam Bridge and then by the outbreak of World War II. During World War II the construction of a pontoon bridge was briefly considered but the decision was made that the floating bridge was adequate. A further plan for a low level bridge was produced in 1947 but again work on Northam Bridge took priority. In 1955 with the work on Northam bridge complete R. Travers Morgan and Partners were commissioned to produce a report on a new bridge. Two reports were produced over the following two years recommended in fixed structure with a dual carriageway and feet of headroom or another with of headroom. An act authorising the bridge was obtained in 1960. However in 1961 Ministry of Transport announced it would not be providing financial support for the bridge which again put the project on hold. Planning In the mid 1960s it became clear to the council that some form of action would have to be taken. The floating bridges were reaching the end of their life requiring an expensive refit or replacement and the compulsory purchase powers under the 1960 Act would expire in 1973. With no possibility of funding from the Ministry of Transport the council started to look into the possibility of constructing a toll bridge. The council requested a formal report on the possibility of a toll bridge from the city Engineer and Surveyor in October 1969 and the report was delivered on 12 March 1970. It recommended a two lane high level bridge with 80 feet of head-space to allow ships from the dockyards upstream to pass under it. A bridge with an opening span was rejected on the basis of the disruption it would cause to traffic every time it had to open. With a toll bridge having been decided upon, it was decided it could also be used to control traffic levels over the bridge to avoid the need to significantly upgrade local roads. This was unpopular with motoring organisations who opposed the council's attempt to get a bill through parliament to authorise the toll bridge. This opposition was overcome after debate at parliamentary committee level and the council obtained its act of parliament in July 1973. The contract for building the bridge was then put out for tender and was awarded to the lowest bidder, Kier Group (then Kier ltd), at a price of ¬£5,710,630. Construction The bridge under construction, 1976 The ceremonial start of construction took place on 22 March 1974 with the Mayor of Southampton driving the first pile.Along with basic site preparation, the first job was the construction of two jetties, one from each bank, to the position in the Itchen where the two piers in the river would be built. The jetty from the east bank was built first with the one on the west bank being delayed by the need to fill in an area of shallow water known as the Chapel Inlet. Once preparation was complete long piles were driven into the ground. Transport limitations meant the piles had to be brought in in sections before being welded together onsite. The piling process on the east bank of the Itchen was delayed by the piles hitting the remains of a jetty which had to be partially removed. Meanwhile on the west side delays were caused after construction disturbed a poorly documented system of sewers. Once the piling was complete pile caps were added and the bridge supports constructed on top of them. From the top of the bridge supports cantilevered arms were then constructed outwards. They were constructed symmetrically in both directions at once in order to keep the weight on the supports balanced. Once the cantilevered arms were complete the sections that spanned the gap between them were cast from concrete in the form of box beams on top of the arms before being moved into place on hydraulic bogies suspended from girders. In order to balance the weight large concrete blocks were placed on the opposite arm. During this period work was slowed by the 1976 British Isles heat wave and subsequent rains. Opening The original plan was for the bridge to open on 1 May 1977 but construction fell behind schedule and instead it was opened 1 June 1977. Before opening to motor vehicles it was decided to hold a pedestrian only day for people to examine the bridge. This was held on Tuesday 31 May 1977. The first member of the public across was the then 69 year old Mrs Edith Parks at around 13:30 with a general opening at 14:00. The bridge opened to motor traffic the following day, 1 June, at 10:30 with the mayoral car leading the way. Former Southampton MP Horace King, Baron Maybray-King decided to celebrate by being driven across in a horse-dawn Landau. Southampton's bus routes started using the bridge on 12 June. The bridge was named by Princess Alexandra, The Hon Mrs Angus Ogilvy on 13 July 1977. This had originally been planned as an opening ceremony but this was changed when the bridge was completed before that date. Maintenance and changes In 2011 the bridge lighting was switched to white LEDs with Blue LEDs placed on the uprights. As part of the bridge's maintenance eight expansion joints were replaced in March 2016. Toll Itchen Bridge toll booths At the Woolston end a toll booth operates daily. Southampton City Council levies a variable toll,Toll charges depending on vehicle type and time of day of crossing. The toll was originally charged in order to help pay the ¬£12.174 million it cost to build and to control traffic levels. The loans to pay for the bridge were paid off in 2016. In the early part of the 40 year period this took, a large part of the loan repayments were met from Southampton Council's general funds but in later years the tolls delivered a surplus.Itchen Bridge Tolls Review: Report of the County Surveyor The toll remains to control the traffic in the areas surrounding the bridge and to cover the ongoing maintenance of the bridge with money beyond what is needed for maintenance going to general council funds. There is a local myth that there was a promise to scrap the toll once the bridge had been paid for but this is not the case. On 21 December 2010, it was announced that an automatic toll system would replace the staffed booth, saving over ¬£200,000 annually. This system measures the height of the front of the vehicle and number of front wheels to judge the applicable toll for that vehicle.

Founded in 1997, the company specializes in web-based (SaaS) Enterprise resource planning systems. Company history 24SevenOffice was started in 1997 in Porsgrunn, Norway under the company name IKT Interactive AS and marketed as kontorplassen.no. The name \\"24SevenOffice\\" was introduced for the company's London branch when the company entered the British market in 2003. The company changed its name to 24SevenOffice in February 2005. Originally based in Skien, the company later moved to Oslo Innovation Center before establishing their current headquarters on Tjuvholmen in the waterfront Fjord City of Oslo. The idea for the company's product was developed in 1996, and 24SevenOffice was an early innovator in the Scandinavian market in terms of web-based enterprise resource planning-solutions (ERP). A British office was established at Surrey Business Park in May 2003, with the company launching its web-based (SaaS) utility computing system to the UK SME market in 2004. An office in Chennai, India was established in 2005, and 24SevenOffice entered the Swedish market when they acquired the leading competitor and ERP-provider Start & Run in a cash deal. In August 2005 the company had an initial public offering that raised million, and the company entered The Norwegian Over the Counter Market list as of 5 October 2005 (the ticker was 24SO), reaching a market value of million, with 5000 customers in Norway. In 2006, the company signed a deal to sponsor rally driver Petter Solberg, the largest private sponsorship in Norwegian sport at that time. Instead of receiving NOK 5 million in cash, Solberg received a 2.9 percent ownership in the company. The German-speaking market was entered in April 2006, when an office in Frankfurt am Main was opened, and in late August/early September they established an office with ten sales agents plus a general manager in Stockholm for the Swedish market. 24SevenOffice initiated strategic cooperation with Active 24 in early 2006 to develop a common platform. During the summer, Active 24 was bought by 24SevenOffice's ERP/CRM competitor Mamut (company), and 24SevenOffice terminated the contract with Active 24 in October demanding NOK 200 million in compensation for lost revenue. After a breakdown of settlement negotiations in the Forliksr√•d in January 2007, 24SevenOffice filed a case against Active 24 for breach of agreement in the Oslo District Court in March. 24SevenOffice lost on all counts in the District Court in December 2007. In January 2008, 24SevenOffice appealed the case to the Borgarting Court of Appeal, reducing the cause of action from NOK 250 to 30 million. 24SevenOffice lost on all counts in the Court of Appeal in December 2008, and was ordered to cover the costs incurred by Active 24 in connection with the dispute totaling NOK 6.91 million. 24SevenOffice appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Norway, but the Supreme Court Appeals Committee in March 2008 unanimously rejected the appeal from 24SevenOffice over the Borgarting Appeal Court's unanimous judgment of December 2008. On a counterclaim from Active 24 and Mamut against 24SevenOffice, the Oslo District Court in May 2010 found, that 24SevenOffice should pay Active 24 NOK 12 million in compensation for wrongfully having terminated the agreement, and a further NOK 360.000 of the opponent's legal costs. 24SevenOffice disagreed with the court ruling, and appealed once again. The Borgarting Court of Appeal in November 2011 ruled to reduce the amount of damages to NOK 4.4 million plus NOK 900.000 in penal interest. With several scrip issues 24SevenOffice raised 25 million NOK (about $4 million at the time) between October 2005 and July 2006. They entered into a strategic partnership with Bluegarden, who for 30 years had delivered digital services for payroll, human resource planning, recruitment and training, in March 2006, and they made a large-scale agreement in April 2006 with US telecommunications software company Webex, a competitor to Norwegian Tandberg videoconferencing equipment manufacturer. In September 2006, 24SevenOffice signed an agreement with Fokus Bank to provide their customers extended functionality in Internet banking. 24SevenOffice had by 2007 reportedly 9000 customers, joined the OpenAjax Alliance, and entered into a strategic partnership with Dun & Bradstreet in May 2007, but despite getting listed on Oslo Axess on 22 June (ticker: TFSO), reaching a market capitalization of NOK 120 million, the company was still losing money. The company ended 2007 with a revenue of NOK 21.7 million. In 2008, 24SevenOffice bought 50% of the stocks in telecommunication company Oyatel, partnered with Nets Group to facilitate invoicing for businesses, and telecommunications company Telipol choose 24SevenOffice's second-generation Internet platform for its 8,000 users. They announced an increase in revenues in Q2 to 11.1 million, up from 4.7 million in the same period the year before. 24SevenOffice had turnover of NOK 37 million in the first half of 2009 which was a doubling compared to the same period the previous year and presented its first positive EBITDA in Q2. Norwegian Association of Auditors signed an agreement with 24SevenOffice in 2011, whereby they only recommend 24SevenOffice as a system for their members to use. Product 24SevenOffice is a web-based (SaaS) ERP system. It includes modules for CRM, accounting, invoicing , e-mail, file/document management and project management.

At the main entrance is a rotunda. The park covers an area of 8.2 hectares (20.3 acres). History The Folly of the Duke of Chartres Carmontelle giving keys to Parc Monceau to the Duke of Chartres (painting by Carmontelle (1779) Turkish tents and lake in Parc Monceau painted by Carmontelle (1779) The classical colonnade in Parc Monceau (1778) The Egyptian Pyramid (1778) in Parc Monceau The park was established by Phillippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Chartres, a cousin of King Louis XVI, fabulously wealthy, and active in court politics and society. In 1769 he had begun purchasing the land where the park is located. In 1778, he decided to create a public park, and employed the writer and painter Louis Carrogis Carmontelle to design the gardens. The Duke was a close friend of the Prince of Wales, later George IV, and a lover of all things English. His intention was to create what was then called an Anglo-Chinese or English garden, on the earlier model of Stowe House in England (1730‚Äì1738), with its examples of the architectural folly, or fantastic reconstructions of buildings of different ages and continents. It was similar in style to several other examples of the French landscape garden built at about the same time, including the Desert de Retz, the gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle and the Folie Saint James. Carmontelle employed a German landscape architect named Etickhausen and the architect of the Duke, Bernard Poyet, to build the follies. The intention of the garden was to surprise and amaze visitors. This goal was clearly stated by Carmontelle: \\"It is not necessary for gardens or nature to be presented in the most agreeable forms. It's necessary instead to preserve the charm that one encounters entering the garden, and to renew it with each step, so that the visitor in his soul will have the desire to revisit the garden every day and to possess it for himself. The true art is to know how to keep the visitors there, through a variety of objects, otherwise they will go to the real countryside to find what should be found in this garden; the image of liberty.\\".Jarrass√©, pg. 77 The garden designed by Carmontelle was finished in 1779. It contained a miniature ancient Egyptian pyramid, a Roman colonnade, antique statues, a pond of water lilies, a tatar tent, a farmhouse, a Dutch windmill, a temple of Mars, a minaret, an Italian vineyard, an enchanted grotto, and \\"a gothic building serving as a chemistry laboratory,\\" as described by Carmontelle. In addition to the follies, the garden featured servants dressed in oriental and other exotic costumes, and unusual animals, such as camels.Jarrass√©, pg. 76. Though the Folly was (and is) frequently described as an Anglo-Chinese or English garden, its architect, Carmontelle, had a very different view. In his work, Jardin de Monceau, pr√®s de Paris, (1779), he wrote: \\"It was not at all an English garden that was intended at Monceau, but precisely what the critics said; to put together into one garden all times and all places. It is simply a fantasy, to have an extraordinary garden, a pure amusement, and not at all the desire to mimic a nation which, when it makes a \\"natural\\" garden, uses a roller on all the greens and spoils nature.\\" As garden fashions changed, in 1781 parts of the park were remodeled into a more traditional English landscape style by the Scottish landscape gardener Thomas Blaikie. In 1787, a new city wall, the Wall of the Farmers-General, was built along the northern edge of the garden, along with a circular rotunda in the form of a classical Doric temple, known as the Pavilion de Chartres, designed by Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The ground floor of the temple was used as a customs house, while the upper floor was an apartment with a view of the garden reserved for the Duke.Jarrass√©, Grammaire des Jardins Parisiens, pg. 78. While The Duke was a supporter of the ideas of the French Revolution, and even voted, as a member of the Assembly, for the execution of his own cousin, Louis XVI, it did not save him. He was guillotined during the Reign of Terror in 1793, and the park was nationalized. left Schematic depiction of Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin's parachute used in the Parc Monceau descent of 22 October 1797. Illustration dates from the early nineteenth century. In 1797, Parc Monceau was the site of the first silk parachute jump, when Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin jumped from a Montgolfier hot air balloon, landing in the park where a large crowd was gathered. The Park of Baron Haussmann After the monarchy was restored, the park was returned to the family of the Duke. During the Second Empire, the family sold lots within the park to real estate developers, who built luxurious town houses, reducing the size of the park by half. The remaining part of the park was purchased by the city of Paris in 1860. All that remained of the original folly was the water lily pond, the stream and the fantasy \\"tombs\\", including the Egyptian pyramid. In 1860, the park was purchased by the city, and in August 1861 Parc Monceau became the first new public park in Paris to be created by Baron Haussmann as part of the grand transformation of Paris begun by Emperor Louis Napoleon. Two main alleys were laid out from east to west and north to south, meeting in the center of the park, and the alleys within the park were widened and paved, so carriages could drive the park. An ornamental gate high was installed along a newly created avenue, boulevard Malesherbes, curving paths were laid out around the park for strolling. The pavillon de Chartres was also modified by the architect, Gabriel Davioud, who had a graceful classical dome added to the structure. He also built a bridge modeled after the Rialto bridge in Venice over the stream to replace the Chinese bridge by Carmontelle that had once been there. He preserved the other follies remaining from the original garden. Haussmann embellished the park with a rich collection of exotic trees and flowers from around the world. In 1871, following the downfall of Louis Napoleon, and the subsequent uprising and then crushing of the Paris Commune, the park was the site of a massacre of Communards by army troops. Claude Monet painted a series of three paintings of the park in the spring of 1876. He painted three further paintings of the park in 1878. Hector Berlioz was also fond of the park. During the Third Republic, Park Monceau was decorated with many statues of writers and musicians; notably a statue of Maupassant by Raoul Verlet (1897); Pailleron by Leopold Bernstamm (1906); Musset by Antonin Merci√© (1906), a statue which had originally stood in the square of the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais; Gounod, also by Antonin Merci√© (1902); Ambroise Thomas by Alexandre Falgui√®re (1900); and Chopin by Froment-Meurice (1906). An arcade of the old Paris Hotel de Ville, burned by the Communards in 1871, was placed near the colonnade of Carmontelle.Jarrass√©, Grammaire des Jardins Parisiens, pg. 81. Features Gustave Caillebotte (1848-1894), Le Parc Monceau, oil on canvas, 1877 The park is unusual in France due to its \\"English\\" style: its informal layout, curved walkways and randomly placed statues distinguish it from the more traditional, French-style garden. It includes a collection of scaled-down architectural features, or follies -- including an Egyptian pyramid, a Chinese fort, a Dutch windmill, and Corinthian pillars. A number of these are masonic references, reflecting the fact that Philippe d'Orl√©ans was a leading freemason. Parc Monceau includes statues of famous French figures including Guy de Maupassant, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Charles Gounod, Ambroise Thomas, Alfred de Musset, and Edouard Pailleron. Today, the park has play areas for children and remains very popular with local residents and their families. The site is an active free Wi-Fi area, for computer users looking for Internet access. Parc Monceau is open daily from sunrise to sunset, with extended hours in the summer months. There are nine gated entries that are monitored by a fifth-generation park watchman who lives above the royal rotunda at the north entrance. The park is listed as grade II semi-private and the six private residences located directly on the park have twenty-four-hour access to the grounds. Access The entrance to Paris M√©tro station Monceau is located at the park's main entrance on Boulevard de Courcelles.

The group was not commercially successful, and Lawton left after the second album, forming a short-lived solo project called the April Lawton Band, which dissolved in the late 1970s. Lawton then left the music scene to concentrate on painting and graphic design. Her personal life remained very private until her death from heart failure at her home on November 23, 2006, aged 58.

She was originally built in 1960 by Oskarshamn shipyard, Oskarshamn, Sweden as the car/passenger ferry SS Bore for Steamship Company Bore, Finland, then the last commercial steam ship built in Scandinavia and the first ferry on the route between Finland and Sweden where cars could drive aboard. She was later known as SS Borea, before being rebuilt as cruise ship in 1988. 1988 to 2010 she was owned by the Finnish shipping company Kristina Cruises and known as MS Kristina Regina until she was retired because she did not comply with new safety regulations. Design and construction In the late 1950s the Finnish Bore Steamship Company identified the need for a new car/passenger ferry to transport passengers and vehicles between Finland and Sweden. The company was at the time collaborating with the Finland Steamship Company and Rederi AB Svea (this collaboration gave birth to Silja Line in 1970) to provide a pooled service between the two countries. The resulting SS Bore was in many aspects a traditional design with two large funnels, two masts, a promenade deck and steam power plant due to the influence of the company‚Äôs largest shareholder, Hans von Rettig (1894-1979). Despite this it offered a ro-ro facility due to the presence of a large hatch on its starboard side which allowed vehicles to enter and exit the vessel. The vessel had two classes (tourist and first class) with berths for 333 passengers and space for cars in a garage on B deck. The public rooms were designed by the architect Ulf Stenhammar and included a separate dining room and bar for each passenger class. The vessel was built at the Oskarshamn shipyard in Oskarshamn, Sweden and by the time it was delivered on 5 April 1960 to its owners it had become last passenger steamship ever to be built in Scandinavia. Service history The Bore Steamship Company used the vessel between 1960 and 1976 providing overnight crossings on the Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm route although she was often used on the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route as well. Most Bore Steamship Company's ships had a number in their name (Bore I of 1898, Bore II of 1906, and the Bore III of 1952), and the lack of number in the name of this ship led to it being nicknamed Nolla-Bore (Zero-Bore) by Finnish seamen. The establishment of the Silja Line in 1970 saw the ships in the fleet kept their own funnel colours, but with the Silja Line logo added. The ships which had been owned by the Finland Steamship Company and Svea Line were painted totally white after the merger, but the Bore kept her original corn-coloured hull. In July 1970 while near Turku, the Bore collided with the Dutch ship Edda. There was no serious damage. In 1972 the ship was rebuilt with additional cabins, which reduced its passenger carrying capacity. Service with the Jakob Line The vessel ended service with the Silja Line in September 1976 having over the past 16 years on the route carried over 1,5 million passengers on 2,473 round trips. The vessel was then laid up in Stockholm until on 10 October 1977 when she was sold to Jakob Lines, a company in which Bore Steamship had a major shareholding. The vessel was renovated and renamed SS Borea. In 1978, the Borea started operating between Jakobstad and Skellefte√•. Generally Jakob Lines only operated her during the summer months, the rest of the year was spent either laid up or occasionally chartered to other companies, though some of which were not too successful. In January 1979, the Borea was chartered to house workers at an oilrig near the Scottish coast. The vessel returned to her sailings from September of that year. On another charter the vessel was used in Alger, Algeria to once again house workers. Service with the Aura Line Jakob Lines sold the ship in April 1984 to Ab Helsingfors Steamship Company who chartered it to the Finnish Aura Line Finnish Aura Line who used her to start a service from Turku to Stockholm as a tourist venture. The Borea began sailing for Aura Line in June 1984, but in October of the same year the Aura Line was declared bankrupt. The 'Borea spent another year laid up, until in October 1985, t was sold to a Canadian firm called Aqua Culture Industries (trading as Vanderbildt Steamship Company) based in Vancouver, who intended to convert the ship into a luxury cruise ship. The plan was never carried out, and the ship continued to be laid up in Turku until January 1987 when Rannikkolinjat, a Finnish company which had been founded in 1985 by the Partanen family from Kotka, Finland purchased her. In the following year the company was renamed Kristina Cruises. Kristina Regina entering Piraeus harbor. Renovation and renaming Renamed MS Kristina Regina after the 17th century Queen Kristina of Sweden, the ship was extensively rebuilt as a cruise ship, with first having her steam engines replaced with diesel units at the Wartsila shipyard at Kotka. Then during the winter of 1988-89 the vessel was completely renovated at the Holming shipyard in Rauma. All cabins without bathrooms were removed and 120 brand new cabins were installed, whilst the remaining 30 were completely renovated. During the renovations her car deck was converted into a 250-seat conference and function hall, a sauna was added on first deck and a tax-free shop was installed on third deck. With exceptions of some minor alterations, her profile remained intact. In April 1989 the Kristina Regina commenced her first cruise, operating from Finland mostly to destinations along the Gulf of Finland, but later also destinations in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and Africa's west coast. By February 2007, she is the only Finnish cruise ship in service. The ship off of Brest, France. A large modernization took place in 2001, but the interiors and exterior remained intact. After 22 years service as a cruise ship and despite still being in good condition the Kristina Regina wasn't capable by 2010 of fulfilling the stricter fire safety requirements of the SOLAS 2010 regulations. As a result it was decided to withdrawn the vessel from international cruise service and replace it with the much larger Kristina Katarina. Preservation The Partanen family were very attached to the Kristina Regina and did not want to see it scrapped. Aware of the efforts of Finnish‚Äôs entrepreneur Johnny Sid‚Äôs well publicized but ultimately failed attempt in 2008 to save the ferry Finnjet Mikko Partanen approached Sid prior to withdrawing the cruise ship from service to see if he was interested in buying the MS Kristina Regina. Sid had an interest in old passenger ships due to his family‚Äôs past involvement with the Bore and Silja lines and in 1984 had enjoyed a family holiday about the Bore. Using the experience he had already gained in attempting to save the Finnjet and later the Kungsholm Sid was able to obtain build a business case and obtain the financing necessary for the Finland-based Oy S/S Borea Ab to buy the Kristina Regina for operation as a hotel, restaurant and museum. Oy S/S Borea Ab is dedicated to preservation ships that have a notable position in Finland's maritime history for use in the fields of culture and tourism. Handover of the ship to its new owners took place in August 2010 and it was then moved to Naantali for renovations. The ship was painted with its original livery and was also given back its original name. While the City of Turku was willing to home the Kristina Regina a permanent berth proved difficult as by the time the vessel was towed to Turku on 3 October 2010 to be permanently moored as a floating hotel and restaurant in the Aura River the planned berth on what had been a former industrial area on the city‚Äôs downtown waterfront was home to newly constructed residential buildings, whose owners object to their view being obstructed by the ship. Following a grand opening on 10 October 2010 two other locations was used before the Viking Line loaned the vessel a berth which is a 10 minute walk from the Silja and Viking Line ferry terminals and adjacent to the vehicle queuing area. The vessel relocated there in May 2011 and became part of the museum fleet of the Forum Marinum. An exhibition produced by Forum Marinum about the ship‚Äôs history was opened in preserved navigation bridge, officer‚Äôs quarters owner‚Äôs suite. In 2011, the ship was accepted into the Finnish Heritage Agency‚Äôs register of traditional vessels, and accommodation and restaurant services were started on the ship in addition to its museum services. In the beginning of 2015, the City of Turku centralised its hostel services to Bore with a three-year contract. The vessel‚Äôs hotel offers accommodation for 250 quests.

He plays regional traditional music on the dambura. Early life Safdar Tawakoli was born in 1942 in the Yakawlang district of Bamyan to a family of moderate means. His interest in music was nurtured during his youth, but he had to overcome the conservative tradition and religious restrictions of his local culture. Despite these, he pursued his field of interest and became a devoted artist. He always admired and in some cases envied the popularity of national singers. He mastered the \\"dambura\\", a regional long necked stringed instrument popular among the Hazaras of central Afghanistan. Career In pursuit of a career in music, he left Bamiyan to run a music store in Kabul that sold cassettes. It was his hard work and talent that led him to the studios of Radio Kabul and Afghanistan's National Television, where he did many shows and sung hundreds of songs. Safdar Tawakuli became a household name in regions and the number of his listeners increased. He became an iconic singer and was awarded with several awards and honorary medals. He has represented Afghan Music in numerous international shows. He headed the Musical group of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs of Afghanistan from 1986 to 1995 for eleven consecutive years. Like everything else Safdar Tawakoli's artistry fell victim to the civil war during which he lost his career, his home, his beloved son but he never lost his fame. He stayed in Afghanistan in extreme conditions, even during the time of the Taliban when his life was in grieve danger. After the fall of Taliban, his musical number, \\"Agar az Bamiyan o Qandahari - Hamay mo Pag biraari\\"; became a symbol of national unity and pride for Afghanistan when it was re-sung by the prominent Afghan Singer Farhad Darya. He was one of the first singers to sing on Afghanistan's National Radio immediately after the fall of the Taliban.

The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century Chinese anarchist orientations. As a slur, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has used the term \\"ultra-left\\" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further \\"left\\" than the party line. According to the latter usage, the CPC Central Committee denounced in 1978 as \\"ultra-left\\" the line of Mao Zedong from 1956 until his death in 1976. This article refers only to 1) the self-defined ultra-left of the GPCR; and 2) more recent theoretical trends drawing inspiration from the GPCR ultra-left, China's anarchist legacy and international \\"left communist\\" traditions.  GPCR ultra-left  \\"Ultra-left\\" refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an antagonistic contradiction between the CPC-PRC party-state itself and the masses of workers and \\"peasants\\"\\"Peasant (ÂÜúÊ∞ë)\\" was the official term for workers on people's communes. According to the Ultra-Left, both peasants and (urban) workers together composed a proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however \\"red\\" a given bureaucrat's \\"thought\\" might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary \\"ideas\\" and \\"habits\\" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to \\"turn over a new leaf\\" after they had undergone \\"thought reform\\", the ultra-left argued that \\"cultural revolution\\" had to give way to \\"political revolution\\" in which \\"one class overthrows another class\\".See, for instance, \\"Whither China?\\" by Yang Xiguang. The masses could achieve democratic control over production and distribution only through \\"a new political power of the Paris Commune type\\".\\"Whither China?\\" This meant that mass delegates subject to immediate recall and a universal salary would take over all the tasks necessary for organizing production and distribution, and all other bureaucratic posts would be abolished, including the military and police, which would give way to an armed citizenry. This revolution would necessarily involve general strikes, mutinies, weapons seizures and ultimately the merging of the Chinese revolution with a global communist revolution. When the central Maoist leaders launched the GPCR in the spring of 1966, they launched a campaign for students and academics to criticize \\"bourgeois\\" or otherwise \\"counter-revolutionary\\" ideas within China's \\"superstructural\\" apparatus. As the Central Committee's put it in August: > Although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, it is still trying to use the > old ideas, culture, customs, habits, practices, traditions, philosophies, > and thinking of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses, capture their > minds and endeavour to stage a comeback. The proletariat must do the exact > opposite: it must meet head-on every challenge of the bourgeoisie in the > ideological field and use the new ideas, culture, customs and habits of the > proletariat to change the mental outlook of the whole of society. At > present, our objective is to struggle against and overthrow those persons in > authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the > reactionary bourgeois academic 'authorities' and the ideology of the > bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, > literature and art and all other parts of the superstructure not in > correspondence with the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the > consolidation and development of the socialist system. Although the 16 Points called on not only students but also \\"the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres\\" to carry out this struggle and although it encouraged activists to \\"institute a system of general elections, like that of the Paris Commune, for electing members to the Cultural Revolutionary groups and committees and delegates to the Cultural Revolutionary congresses\\", this and other proof of the central Maoist leaders made clear that this was to be wen (Êñá) struggle rather than a wu (Ê≠¶) struggle. The leaders used these terms to emphasize that \\"martial\\" (wu) or physical violence should be avoided in favor of \\"verbal\\" (wen) struggle (big-character posters, debates, rallies and so on), that is, though the 16 Points announced GPCR a great political revolution, armed struggle or challenge towards army is not excepted. The rationale was that China's economic structure or \\"base\\" had already completed its transition to socialist productive relations (Mao had announced this good news in 1956), so now the next logical step before full communization was to complete the superstructural transformation. After the conservative Lin Biao made a failed coup, Mao recognized: \\"Even now China practices an eight-grade wage system, distribution according to work and exchange through money, and in all this differs very little from the old society. What is different is that the system of ownership has been changed. Our country at present practices a commodity system, the wage system is unequal, too, as in the eight-grade wage scale, and so forth. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat such things can only be restricted. Therefore, if people like Lin Biao come to power, it will be quite easy for them to rig up the capitalist system. That is why we should do more reading of Marxist-Leninist works\\". Zhang Chunqiao took some measures on the direct management of workers and peasants in Shanghai. When in late 1966 over a million workers in Shanghai extended their activism into a general strike calling for improved salaries and democratic control over workplace management and city governance, Maoist worker representatives such as Wang Hongwen criticized some demands as \\"economistic\\" violation (which means it was another strategy of capitalist-roader Cao Diqiu to bribe workers and cause crisis) of point 14 of the 16 Points: \\"embrace the revolution while stimulating production (ÊäìÈù©ÂëΩÔºå‰øÉÁîü‰∫ß)\\". With some police assistance, these representatives managed to silence the more radical rank-and-file demands (called \\"Far- rightist under a leftist form) and absorb their energy into the nominal January Storm, which replaced the city government and party committee with a Shanghai People's Commune ruled by Wang and Zhang Chunqiao. Some intransigent rebels called for democratic control over the Commune and even the abolition of all \\"heads\\". When Mao heard of this he told Zhang to transform the Commune into a revolutionary committee in which mass representatives would share power with army and party representatives and recommended that this model of \\"power seizure\\" be propagated throughout China lest people get the wrong idea from Shanghai's invocation of the Paris Commune.Mao Zedong, \\"Talks at Three Meetings with Comrades Chang Ch‚Äôun-ch‚Äôiao and Yao Wen-yuan\\", Selected Works, Volume 9. Thus marched the People's Liberation Army onto the stage of GPCR mass politics and began what the ultra-left would later call the February Adverse Current. It was out of this momentary radicalization of GPCR mass politics and its sudden suppression and redirection that the ultra-left currents were born under the direct order from Zhou Enlai, first independently within rebel groups scattered throughout China, then by late 1967 in increasing dialogue until their suppression during the following years. The earliest record GPCR scholar Wang Shaoguang has found of something like an ultra-left position is an open letter from two high school students to Lin Biao, published under the pseudonym Yilin-Dixi in November 1966.Wang Shaoguang. 1999. \\"'New Trends of Thought' on China's Cultural Revolution\\". Journal of Contemporary China, 8:21, 3. Whereas Lin had recently sought to curb Red Guard rebellion by interpreting Mao's \\"Bombard the Headquarters\\" to mean \\"bombard a few capitalist roaders\\" as opposed to \\"bombard our proletarian headquarters\\", Yilin-Dixi argued that it was the so-called \\"proletarian headquarters\\" itself that had \\"become obsolete\\" and needed to be \\"reformed\\", saying: \\"We must create a whole new state machinery to replace the old one\\".

Plants in this genus share similarities with those in both Darwinia and Verticordia. They are shrubs with their leaves arranged in opposite pairs and with flowers appearing either singly or in small groups, usually in upper leaf axils. They are found in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. The genus was first described in 1836. None of the species is common nor are they well-known in horticulture. Description Plants in the genus Homoranthus are shrubs with their leaves arranged in opposite pairs, at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate) so that the leaves are in four rows along the stems. They are linear to cylindrical in shape, sometimes thicker than wide. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to four in the upper leaf axils. There are five sepals and five petals which are enclosed in two bracteoles before the flower opens, and which surround the base of the style. There are ten stamens alternating with ten staminodes. The style extends beyond the petals and has a ring of hairs below its tip. The fruit is a capsule containing one or two seeds. The Australian botanist Norman Byrnes has noted that Homoranthus \\"is not a clearly defined natural group but is more a genus of convenience between Darwinia and Verticordia. jstor In 1869, George Bentham wrote \\"Its retention [as a separate genus] may, however, be justified as facilitating the distinction between Darwinia and Verticordia\\".

It is revealed that the poppy field is in the middle of the Arctic. Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen), a radio astronomer working for SETI, discovers an extraterrestrial radio signal from Wolf 336, a star 14 light years from Earth. Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), but Phil dismisses the findings. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki (Tony T. Johnson). Zane again locates the radio signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to consult his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously, purportedly from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to the fictional town of San Marsol in Mexico and finds that the local radio station, from which the signal apparently originated, was just burnt to the ground. Searching the area around town, he comes across a recently constructed power plant. There, he meets Ilana Green, and tries to help protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. While in custody at the plant, Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently and abruptly risen a few degrees, melting parts the polar ice and shifting the ecosystem. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built across the developing world, that appears to be the cause of this intensified increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment. Surprisingly, Zane notices that one of the guards appears to be an identical twin of his former boss, Phil. As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates an apparent miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment. Zane leaves Ilana to again investigate the power plant and she is soon killed by scorpions planted in her room. Zane discovers the plant doubles as a front for an underground alien base. The aliens are able to disguise themselves with an external skin to infiltrate human society. Zane finds that all of the bases expel large amounts of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Zane is discovered but escapes back into the nearby town and attempts to convince the local inspector of the situation. However, alien agents bring Ilana's body to the police station, making Zane a suspect in her death; Zane escapes and sneaks back into the United States. He accosts Phil on the JPL grounds, forcing him to admit that the aliens are trying to raise the Earth's temperature to not only kill off humans (by greatly exacerbating anthropogenic climate change) but to make the planet hospitable for themselves. Zane surreptitiously records the conversation and once Phil discovers the recording he sends agents to stop Zane. Zane returns home to find his attic devoid of equipment. He figures out the most feasible way to widely broadcast the tape is to go to a nearby large satellite uplink and beam a signal directly to a hacked news satellite, overriding it and broadcasting his tape worldwide. With the help of his girlfriend Char (Teri Polo) and Kiki, he travels to a large radio astronomy array, hoping to use one of the dishes as a satellite ground station, but Phil and his agents soon disable the telescope/satellite controls from the main building. Wondering how they were found so quickly, Zane briefly suspects Char of being an alien, until they are both attacked by one of Phil's agents. Zane leaves the tape with Kiki and instructs him to transmit it when he gives the order. He and Char then sneak over to the telescope's base and barricade themselves in the control room. Zane makes the necessary adjustments and tells Kiki to activate the tape, but Kiki reveals himself to be an alien agent and he opens the door to allow Phil inside, who confiscates the tape. Phil and his agents ram down the door to the satellite control room with a van, but Zane freezes them with liquid nitrogen vapors. As he works to free the tape stuck in Phil's frozen jacket, one of the agents drops a sphere which starts to form another, larger, singularity in the room. Phil begins to defrost, and tries to grab Zane's arm, but Zane smashes off Phil's arm with a fire axe. Zane and Char escape through the radio telescope station's access shaft, exiting safely onto the collapsed dish before the device implodes most of the telescope dish's base. Below them they see Kiki; before he flees, Zane tells him to tell the aliens that he will soon broadcast this tape. In the film's epilogue, Zane's conversation with Phil is broadcast across the globe.

Filming took place primarily in Mexico, with additional scenes filmed at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. The alien creatures were all digitally created for the movie by Pacific Data Images. Charlie Sheen had previously collaborated with David Twohy on Terminal Velocity, and Twohy had written the main role intending for Sheen to star. Release Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics; at review aggregation website, Rotten Tomatoes it has a rating of 65% based on reviews from 34 critics, with an average score of 6.23/10, and its consensus states that \\"The Arrival is stylish and inventive and offers a surprisingly smart spin on the alien invasion genre.\\" Box office Despite praise from critics and audiences alike, the film only grossed US$14 million in the North American domestic market, against an estimated production budget of US$25 million. Part of this was due to high-visibility marketing campaign for the release of Independence Day just over a month later, which also received a mixed critical response but went on to become a box office phenomenon. However, The Arrival had a rather successful run internationally, partly because Charlie Sheen still maintained high popularity worldwide at the time. Home media A Blu-ray version of the film was released April 21, 2009. Unlike the laserdisc release, the Blu- ray version includes no special features. The laserdisc release included commentary, documentaries and alternative endings not included in the Blu-ray or DVD releases. Sequel A sequel, Arrival II, was released on November 6, 1998. Video game The Arrival was released on Windows in 1997.

Tenney and starring Patrick Muldoon, Jane Sibbett, Michael Sarrazin, and Catherine Blythe. It is the sequel to the 1996 film The Arrival. Plot Arrival II takes place two years after the first film. Zane Zaminski (the protagonist from The Arrival) is found dead in a remote Eskimo community. It is purported that he died of a heart attack. His broadcast to the world about the aliens is widely believed to have been a UFO hoax due to his dismissal from NASA (this despite Earth continuing to have record temperatures). As his death is announced on TV, five people receive envelopes with details of an alien invasion. This group of five consists of three scientists, Zane's step brother Jack Addison (a computer expert whom he has not seen in seven years), and a reporter named Bridget Riordan. They receive papers talking of global warming and of aliens terraforming Earth into a planet that is hot, like their own dying world. The group gets together in a large freezer (as the aliens can't stand cold) to see what Zane has left them. They find some alien artifacts in an envelope left to the group. One of the five, Trevor Anguilar, suffers from the cold and is revealed as an alien. He sets off a metal sphere (a \\"black hole bomb\\" or BHB as it rises into the air, revolves then sucks everything in a large area into it, causing it to vanish permanently). The alien and one of the men, Tom Billings, are sucked into the BHB's area of influence as well as the contents of the room but Addison, Riordan, and Zarcoff manage to escape. Zarcoff in his hotel room is killed by an alien metal spider machine which injects him, making it look like his death was from a heart attack. Addison goes back to his rooms to find a BHB has cleared them of everything. Sandra Wolfe, a girl he picked up and slept with last night turns out to be an alien. She and another alien, Wotan, inject Addison and he later wakes up to find himself being \\"taken for a ride\\". Addison rolls out of the car and despite terrible disorientation manages to elude them and team up with Riordan again. The aliens have set the FBI on the two as well as cancelling their credit cards and emptying Addison's bank account of $15,000. The pair have only one artifact left and that produces a perfect 3D hologram when a laser beam is shone through it. They use it to find out that an atomic power plant due to be opened near where they are in Quebec is in the hands of the aliens. Later it is revealed that it is to go critical and will spread deadly radiation over many hundreds of miles (the aliens are immune to radiation). Addison and Riordan attempt to show the hologram at a climate seminar, and Addison's boss, Burke, agrees to help them. But before they can activate the device, they are caught by Dave Cyrus, another of Addison's co-workers who has sold them out to the FBI. Burke kills Cyrus and frames Addison for it, revealing himself to be an alien, as well. Barely escaping, Addison and Riordan break into a university and use an industrial laser to properly activate the artifact. Addison uses his computer skills to walk around and interact with an alien ship in space and to program a giant BHB deep below the power plant to go off in one hour. The aliens arrive and both are captured from the hologram. In the atomic power station, their time seems to be up until the giant BHB goes off in the alien area below it and starts ripping apart and swallowing the atomic power station. Wotan and Wolfe are dragged through the gaping hole in the floor. Nearly dragged into its sphere of influence himself, Addison uses a small BHB to stop the giant one long enough for him and Riordan to escape. They just make it as all that is left of the power station is a huge hole in the ground. Burke also survives, but injured, his alien features partly visible. He warns Addison that the aliens haven't been stopped, just delayed. Some time later, Riordan's book Alien Agenda (which details their recent adventures as well as the alien's plans for the world) is still top of The New York Times best seller lists after 2 months. The world still seems to consider it all fiction. The film ends with the married couple driving to Alaska and it is just beginning to snow as they cross the border, which suits them fine.

Rabidoux and Beadle were veterans of the local hardcore scene, and had broken away from their respective bands out of a need to try something new musically. Their initial plans were to find a vocalist and bassist, but after recruiting Frattini, decided to remain an instrumental trio. Their style draws heavily upon 70s progressive rock, particularly King Crimson and Yes, as well as fusion, hardcore, and math rock. Their first self-titled 3 song EP was released in 2001, consisting of 2 studio tracks and 1 live track. Their 9 song full-length debut The Audio Medium followed in 2002. The album explored a number of sonic landscapes, and revolved around the concept of the corporate music industry's control of the masses; that people are sheep to what music corporations and radio stations tell them to listen to, unaware of the real music that exists out there. As in the medical world, a \\"cancer conspiracy\\" that hides the cure for cancer for the purpose of making money from the sick. The album booklet contained a letter from a doctor by the name of Dr. Travis John, who shared similar views and who warned the band of the trouble they were getting themselves into. The band toured extensively with bandmates on their label Big Wheel Recreation, and also opened for Oysterhead. Their shows were sometimes augmented by video projections. In 2003, while at a show in New York City, their van was stolen, along with all of their equipment. This was the last and most disastrous in a series of mishaps that had plagued their tours. They decided to call it a day in late 2003. There were reports on the Big Wheel Recreation website that they were working on a second album, and songs have surfaced on P2P filesharing programs. The album is now being released by both Gilead and Radar Recordings, after years of legal issues surrounding the intellectual rights of the music. The album, Omega, was released in January 2008. Rabidoux is now working full- time as an engineer and producer at Strangeways Recording Studio in Providence, Rhode Island. He has also reunited with Frattini to form Deleted Arrows \\"\\". Beadle currently plays in a classic rock inspired band called Township in Roslindale, Massachusetts. The Cancer Conspiracy reunited for the Rocketsled reunion show in Burlington, Vermont on January 21, 2017. The original lineup of Daryl Rabidoux, Greg Beadle, and Brent Frattini played two songs, \\"Broken Heartbeats Gathered and Rebroadcast\\" and \\"Summer of Andy.\\" On April 27, 2018 it was announced that the band would perform again, this time as part of a celebration of the life of Cave In bassist Caleb Scofield.

The species was first described by Carl Geyer in 1835. It has a wingspan of - inches (8.2 - 11.5 cm). As the name suggests, the larvae (caterpillars) feed on elm trees (Ulmus), but they can also be found feeding on birch (Betula), basswood (Tilia), and cherry (Prunus). When the caterpillars are ready, they crawl to the bottom of the host tree, where they crawl underneath the soil and pupate and may overwinter underground if late enough into the year. Vegetable growers should be aware of this larvae due to its insatiable appetite. One of these larvae are capable in devouring huge amounts of plant's foliage and even succulent stems. Range C. amyntor can be found from Nova Scotia west to Alberta and western North Dakota and Colorado; south to central Florida, the Gulf Coast, Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Status The species is not threatened. Life cycle C amyntor adults fly as a single brood in the northern portions of their range from June to July. There are two broods further south, flying later into the year, and five broods have been confirmed in Louisiana from March to October. Egg Tiny, translucent, lime-green eggs deposited on the underside of host leaves. The shells are transparent and pearly after hatching. Larva Larva Larvae come in two different color phases; a green phase, and a dark phase which differs in shades of brown, orange, and somewhat of a pinkish brown. Larvae complete all five instars within approximately one month. The first instar is the same shade of green as its egg. As the larva progresses through its instars, change in structure is noticeable. The caterpillar sports four, long, horn-like projections - in addition to the tail horn - from above its head, which is why the elm sphinx is sometimes called the four-horned sphinx. Pupa As with other Sphingidae, C. amyntor goes through a \\"wandering\\" phase where it stops feeding and burrows into the soil in order to pupate. Before pupating, the larva shrinks a considerable amount and then sheds its remaining skin that distinguishes it as a caterpillar, revealing its shell- like pupa. Imago The overall coloring of the imago, or adult, elm sphinx is a gray-brown with wavy markings covering the forewings. In the upper center of the forewings, as with other Ceratomia species, there is a small white dot. The hindwings are a plain gray with a darker band running the length of the near-edge. The outer ends of the forewings and hindwings are both dashed with a light-dark-light pattern. Three broken, dark bands run the length of the body from the thorax to the tip of the abdomen. The antennae are stiff and wiry and have hook at the tips. Some specimens have a prominent splash of bright white on their upper head and wings and stand out considerably from other C. amyntor.

Lambros Katsonis (; ; 1752‚Äì1804) was a Greek revolutionary hero of the 18th century; he was also a knight of the Russian Empire and an officer with the rank of colonel in the Imperial Russian Army (or Navy), decorated with an Order of St. George, IV class medal. Life Born in Levadia, he joined the Orlov Revolt in 1770, but not pleased by the result he built up a small fleet and began harassing the Ottomans in the Aegean Sea. In 1778 he assembled a Greek pirate fleet of seventy vessels, which harassed the Turkish squadrons in the Aegean and forced the Ottomans to abandon the island of Kastelorizo; the castle on the island was renamed to Lambros Katsonis Castle. In 1790 he was defeated at the Battle of Andros. Katsonis had his hideout in the bay of Porto Kagio. The Algerians joined in with the Ottomans to defeat Katsonis. They cornered him at Porto Kagio and Katsonis' navy was destroyed. Katsonis escaped to Odessa and Yalta where he was granted the Livadia estate ‚Äîwhat was later to become the Livadia Palace estate‚Äî by Catherine the Great. He lived out the rest of his days there. His wife was known as Angelina in Russia, but her real name was Maria Sophianou. He had three sons and possibly one daughter. His first son was killed by the Turks when he was still infant, in the Greek island of Kea. The second, Lykourgos (known in Russia as –õ–∏–∫—É—Ä–≥ –õ–∞–º–±—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ö–∞—á–∏–æ–Ω–∏, 1790-1863), born on a Greek island, had a brilliant career as officer in the Russian Army, including his service in the Greek Battalion of Balaklava. The third son, Alexander who was born in the Crimea, also became an officer in the Russian Army. According to some sources he had a daughter named Garyfallia, but there is no information about her life. One of Lambros' grandsons, Spyridon son of Alexander, was a known Russian writer. He was also the godfather of Odysseas Androutsos, a commander of the Greek War of Independence. The Livadia Palace, the summer home of the last Tsars was built on Katsonis' Livadia estate after 1861. The name of the estate was given to it by Katsonis, who named it after his birthplace; moreover, this is the origin of the name of Livadiya town itself. It is there that the World War II Yalta Conference took place. The Hellenic Navy has named four of its ships after Katsonis.

Leukocoria resembles eyeshine, but leukocoria can also occur in animals that lack eyeshine because their retina lacks a tapetum lucidum. Leukocoria is a medical sign for a number of conditions, including Coats disease, congenital cataract, corneal scarring, melanoma of the ciliary body, Norrie disease, ocular toxocariasis, persistence of the tunica vasculosa lentis (PFV/PHPV), retinoblastoma, and retrolental fibroplasia. Because of the potentially life-threatening nature of retinoblastoma, a cancer, that condition is usually considered in the evaluation of leukocoria. In some rare cases (1%) the leukocoria is caused by Coats' disease (leaking retinal vessels). Diagnosis On photographs taken using a flash, instead of the familiar red-eye effect, leukocoria can cause a bright white reflection in an affected eye. Leukocoria may appear also in low indirect light, similar to eyeshine. Leukocoria can be detected by a routine eye exam (see Ophthalmoscopy). For screening purposes, the red reflex test is used.

The species was first described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1874.  Distribution  Ceratomia hageni is a native of midwest North America and can be found from Michigan to Georgia, Nebraska to Texas, and most places in between, with regards to its only known host plant.  Biology  From oviposition of the eggs to pupation, approximately four weeks will pass. Where multiple broods occur, pupae will eclose in two weeks, or when conditions are suitable in cool climates. An adult C. hageni has many colors, viewable when looked over thoroughly. The forewing is grayish-green and has many, wavy lines, similar to other specimens of the Ceratomia genera. The hindwing is a browner gray with a lighter gray towards the outer margins Food plants C. hageni is known to feed on only one food; *Maclura pomifera (Osage orange)  Description  Egg The eggs are translucent, milky white and green, oval and about 0.5 mm in diameter. They are laid in masses on the undersurface of leaves, while smaller masses are deposited onto branches on the Osage orange tree. Eggs incubate and hatch five to seven days after oviposition. Larva Pupa As with most other Sphingidae, Ceratomia hageni will burrow into the ground after its fifth and final instar in order to pupate. The larvae will go into a \\"wandering\\" stage where it leaves the Osage orange tree and climbs to the ground to find a place to bury itself so that it may pupate. The larvae will then shed its fifth instar skin to reveal its pupal skin, which will be soft and almost translucent at first, but will then harden to a light brown for protection from the elements.

He was best known for his performances of twentieth-century music but also gained wide recognition for his work with early keyboards, performing frequently with Baroque ensembles.  Biography  Education Paul Jacobs was born in New York City and attended PS 95 and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and studied at the Juilliard School, where his teacher was Ernest Hutcheson. He became a soloist with Robert Craft's Chamber Arts Society and played with the Composer's Forum. He made his official New York debut in 1951. Reviewing that concert, Ross Parmenter described him in The New York Times as 'a young man of individual tastes with an experimental approach to the keyboard that he already has mastered.' Europe in the 1950s He moved to France after his graduation in 1951. There he began his long association with Pierre Boulez, playing frequently in his Domaine musical concerts, which introduced many of the key works of the early twentieth- century to post-war Paris. At a single concert in 1954, which must have lasted close to five hours and also included works by Stravinsky, Debussy and Var√®se, Jacobs contributed chamber music by Berg, Webern and Bart√≥k and gave the premi√®re of a new work by Michel Philippot.Antoine Gol√©a: Rencontres avec Pierre Boulez (Paris: Editions Slatkine, 1982), 188, In a 1958 Domaine concert he played a work written for him by the 21-year-old Richard Rodney Bennett, his Cycle 2 for Paul Jacobs.J√©sus Aguila: Le domaine musical - Pierre Boulez et vingt ans de cr√©ation contemporaine (Paris: Fayard/Fondation SACEM, 1992), 290, He acted as rehearsal pianist for the incidental music which Boulez wrote for Jean-Louis Barrault's production of the Oresteia in 1955.Dominique Jameux: Boulez (Paris: Fayard/Fondation SACEM, 1984), 108, Jacobs later said that meeting Boulez had put an end to his own composing ambitions: 'I just gave it up. I wouldn't have dared show anything of mine to Boulez.'Richard Dyer: A Pianist with a Passion for the New, interview with Jacobs in The New York Times, 27th October 1974, retrieved on 28-02-2009 During his time in Europe he appeared as soloist with the Orchestre National de Paris and the Cologne Orchestra and made many radio broadcasts. He played for the International Society for Contemporary Music in Italy and at the International Vacation Courses for new music at Darmstadt. For the 1957 course, Wolfgang Steinecke invited him to give the European premi√®re of Stockhausen's Klavierst√ºck XI, a key work in the development of 'controlled chance'Letter dated 12 July 1957 from Stockhausen to David Tudor, published in Imke Misch and Markus Bandur: Karlheinz Stockhausen bei den Internationalen Ferienkursen f√ºr Neue Musik in Darmstadt 1951‚Äì1996: Dokumente und Briefe (K√ºrten: Stockhausen-Verlag, 2001), 172, . and this may have been at the composer's suggestion.Misch and Bandur, 142; Joan Peyser: Boulez: Composer, Conductor, Enigma (London: Cassell, 1976), 125, Like many musicians with a commitment to new music, his existence was frugal. For broadcasts he would be paid as little as $5, which went up to $25 when he played the premiere of the Henze Piano Concerto 'because of the special difficulty of the piece'. He lived in a hotel 'with a window facing a wall so that I had to go outside to see what the weather was. There was room only for a bed and a piano and a little alcohol burner to make stew on.' Around this time he became a close friend of the French painter , whom he described as an important influence. New York 1960-83 Tired of trying to live on $500 a year, he returned to New York in 1960 with the assistance of Aaron Copland who arranged for some teaching work at Tanglewood. In November and December 1961 he gave a pair of Town Hall recitals, mixing Boulez and Copland, Stockhausen and Debussy. The New York Times described them as 'just about overwhelming ... make no mistake, Mr Jacobs is a virtuoso even in the traditional sense'.Eric Salzman: The New York Times, 17th December 1961, retrieved on 02-28-2009 He made his recital debut as a harpsichordist at Carnegie Hall in February 1966 with a programme which included Bach, Haydn and the Falla Harpsichord Concerto.The New York Times, 1st March 1966, retrieved on 02-28-2009 During the 1960s and 1970s he continued to give solo recitals and played frequently for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. He performed with the Fromm Fellowship Players at Tanglewood, Gunther Schuller's Contemporary Innovations and Arthur Weisberg's Contemporary Chamber Ensemble. He taught at Tanglewood and at the Mannes and Manhattan music schools in New York. For the last fifteen years of his life he was Associate Professor of Music at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. Jacobs was the New York Philharmonic's official pianist (from 1961) and harpsichordist (from 1974) until his death. He held the post during the tenure of three music directors. He can be heard as soloist in Bernstein's recording of Messiaen's Trois petites liturgiesCBS 72281, LP and both Boulez'sSony Classical SMK 64 109, CD and Mehta'sCBS DGTM-6001, LP recordings of Stravinsky's Petrushka.

C.:McFarland, 2007), 81, . He had a long collaboration with the American composer Elliott Carter, recording most of Carter's solo piano music and ensemble works with keyboard, including the Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano, With Two Chamber Orchestras, the Cello Sonata and the Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord. He was one of the four American pianists who commissioned Carter's large-scale solo piano work Night Fantasies (1978‚Äì80), the others being Charles Rosen, Gilbert Kalish and Ursula Oppens (with whom Jacobs often performed two-piano works).John F. Link: Elliott Carter: A Guide to Research, Composers Resource Manual 52 (New York: Garland Publishing, 2000), 41. . It was Jacobs who organised the consortium after he and Oppens realised that Carter's previous reluctance to accept a commission for a new solo piano work from one pianist might have been born out of a desire not to offend others.Ursula Oppens: booklet note to Elliott Carter: A Nonesuch Retrospective, Nonesuch 7559-79922-1, page 42 He gave the New York premiere of the work in November 1981.

The music ranged from Josquin to two new compositions dedicated to Jacobs (by William Bolcom and David Schiff).Teresa Sterne: accompanying note to Jacobs' recording of the Debussy Etudes Pierre Boulez wrote in the programme: 'twentieth-century music owes him thanks for all the talent he generously put at its disposal.' Bolcom included a lament for Jacobs as the slow movement of his 1983 Violin Concerto and dedicated his Pulitzer Prize-winning 12 New Etudes to him. He had begun to compose them for Jacobs in 1977 and completed them after his death.Allan Kozzin: How the Spell Was Broken For Bolcom's Etudes, The New York Times, 31st July 1988, retrieved on 2008-05-13 Jacobs was also one of the friends and colleagues commemorated by John Corigliano in his Symphony No. 1.Edward Rothstein: Themes of AIDS and Remembrance in Corigliano's Symphony, The New York Times, 11th January 1992, retrieved on 2008-05-02  Repertoire and style  Although Jacobs was associated with some of the most challenging music of the modernist tradition, his colleague Gilbert Kalish stressed that 'far from being an \\"intellectual performer\\", Paul was the most intuitive and spontaneous kind of musician. Few who heard him play will ever forget the splashing brilliance of his runs, the glitter of his attacks, his aristocratic sense of rhythm and phrasing ... I have never seen anyone play the piano with such feline grace and alertness.' Of his commitment to contemporary music, Jacobs himself said this: 'I feel absolutely perplexed at times why performers don't feel at home with the music of their own century. The music that hit me first when I was an adolescent was the music of the beginning of the century, all the way up through Stravinsky, even in his later years. It just doesn't pose any stylistic problems, it's as easy to speak as if you were reading the newspaper, I just know what to do with it.' Perhaps the composer with whom he is now most closely associated is Debussy, most of whose major piano works he recorded, including the Pr√©ludes, Etudes, Images and Estampes. His was one of the first recordings of Debussy's three 1894 Images, which had only recently been published. Writing of a reissue of one of these recordings in 2002, the Gramophone commented: 'Hearing Paul Jacobs ... is a sharp and salutary reminder of a novel‚Äö vigorous and superbly uncluttered view of Debussy ... one which stresses the composer‚Äôs revolutionary fervour. The power and focus of these performances remain astonishing with opalescent mists and hazes burnt away to reveal a corruscating wit and vitality. There is absolutely nothing here of the decadent and lethargic man of popular imagination. Throughout‚Äö Jacobs' commitment to every note of Debussy‚Äôs phantasmagoric visions is total. All his recordings should be reissued.'Gramophone magazine, August 2002  Discography  Early recordings Jacobs began his recording career in Europe in the 1950s. One of his first records (in 1953) was of Beethoven's Second Piano Concerto with the Paris Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ren√© Leibowitz, coupled with Leibowitz's own realisation of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in E flat major of 1784, written when Beethoven was 14 and of which only the piano part survives.Oceanic OCS 35, LP (1953); Disco Archivia 1007, CD In Paris in 1956 he gave the first complete cycle in a single concert of the Schoenberg piano music, going on to record it for the V√©ga label. He also acted as producer on recordings conducted by Ren√© Leibowitz, including the first LP recording of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder. He was the harpsichord soloist in the 1968 Columbia recording of the Carter Double Concerto with Charles Rosen (piano) and the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Frederick Prausnitz.Columbia MS 7191, LP and played on the 1970 CRI recording of Morton Feldman's The Viola in My Life.New World Records, 80657-2, CD Nonesuch LPs His reputation as a recording artist rests largely on a series of LPs he made for the American Nonesuch label, for most of which he wrote a wide- ranging accompanying essay. Beginning in 1968 and 1973 with chamber and concertante works by Carter, from 1976 onwards he concentrated on the solo and duet repertoire. Most have remained available over the years thanks to CD reissues by Nonesuch and, later, by Warner. The small American label Arbiter has also done much to keep Jacobs' recorded legacy before the public. In 2008 Arbiter released a two-CD set of the Stravinsky two piano / four-hand repertoire (with Ursula Oppens), coupled with some previously unpublished live recordings by Jacobs. They have also reissued his recordings of the piano music of Busoni, whom Jacobs considered 'the great underrated master of the twentieth century'. The list of the Nonesuch LPs is in chronological order, with CD reissues under each entry. *Carter: Chamber Music **Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord (with Harvey Sollberger, flute; Charles Kuskin, oboe; Fred Sherry, cello) **Sonata for Cello and Piano (with Joel Krosnick, cello) **Recorded August 1968, Rutgers Presbyterian Church, New York, under the supervision of the composer **Nonesuch LP H-71234; published 1969 **Reissued on CD with the Harpsichord Concerto (next) on Elektra Nonesuch CD, 9 79183-2, published 1992 **Also included in Elliott Carter: A Nonesuch Retrospective, 4-CD set, Nonesuch 7559-79922-1, published 2009 *Carter: Harpsichord Concerto **Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras **Jacobs, harpsichord; Gilbert Kalish, piano; The Contemporary Chamber Ensemble; Arthur Weisberg, conducting **Recorded September 1973 **Nonesuch LP H-71314; published 1975 **Reissued with the two chamber sonatas from Nonesuch LP H-71234 (previous) on Elektra Nonesuch CD, 9 79183-2, published 1992 **Also included in Elliott Carter: A Nonesuch Retrospective, 4-CD set, Nonesuch 7559-79922-1, published 2009 *Schoenberg: Complete Piano Music **Three piano pieces, Op. 11 **Six little piano pieces, Op. 19 **Piano pieces, Opp. 33a, 33b **Five piano pieces, Op. 23 **Suite for piano, Op. 25 **Nonesuch LP H-71309, published 1975 **Reissued on Nonesuch CD, 9 71309-2; Warner Apex CD, *Debussy: Etudes **Etudes for piano, Book I **Etudes for piano, Book II **Recorded June 1975, Rutgers Presbyterian Church, New York **Nonesuch LP H-71322; published 1976 **Reissued 1987 on Nonesuch CD, 9 79161-2, coupled with a live recording of Debussy's En blanc et noir (with Gilbert Kalish), Ojai Festival, California, 5 June 1982 *Twentieth-century Piano Etudes **Bart√≥k: Three Etudes, Op. 18 **Busoni: Six Polyphonic Etudes **Messiaen: Quatre √©tudes de rythme **Stravinsky: Four Etudes, Op. 7 **Recorded April 26‚Äì28, 1976, New York ** Nonesuch LP H-71334; published 1976 **Included on Arbiter 2-CD set, arbiter 124 *Debussy: Preludes **Preludes for piano, Book I **Preludes for piano, Book II **Nonesuch LP HB-73031, published 1978 **Reissued on Nonesuch CD, 9 73031-2; Warner Ultima CD 79474 *Stravinsky: Music for Two Pianos and Piano, Four Hands **(with Ursula Oppens) **Concerto per due pianoforti soli **Sonata for two pianos **Zvietotchnoy valse (for piano, 4 hands) **Three easy pieces (for piano, 4 hands) **Five easy pieces (for piano, 4 hands) **Etude for pianola (performed on 2 pianos) **Recorded June 13‚Äì15, 1977, New York **Nonesuch LP H-71347; published 1978 **Included on arbiter 155, a 2-CD set, which also includes previously unpublished concert recordings 1972-81 *Ravel: Works for Piano, Four and Six Hands **Sites auriculaires (with Gilbert Kalish) **Frontispice (with Gilbert Kalish and Teresa Sterne) **coupled with Ravel vocal and chamber works played by other artists **Nonesuch LP H-71355; published 1978 **Reissued 1987 on Nonesuch CD, 9 71355-2 *Busoni: The Six Sonatinas for Piano **Sonatina (1910) **Sonatina seconda (1912) **Sonatina ad usum infantis (1915) **Sonatina in diem nativitatis MCMXVII (1917) **Sonatina brevis.

The Magpies made the Grand Final again in 2003, but Lockyer missed most of the season, when he suffered an Anterior Cruciate Ligament injury in Round 3 and had to be stretchered off the ground. The injury required knee reconstruction surgery which ended his season. In the 2005 season he had 430 disposals in 22 matches, playing in every game. In 2006 he played every game. 2007 Lockyer began 2007 with a goal against the North Melbourne Kangaroos. Two weeks later, he had 32 possessions in a game against the Richmond Tigers. Opposition coach, Chris Connolly claimed Lockyer would be the first player selected if State of Origin football was to be played this year.Beacham, D and O'Donoghue, C;Connolly wants Metro v Country;31 May 2007  2009  Lockyer played his 200th AFL game in his home state against the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval during Round 9 of the 2009 season. Collingwood won the game by 22 points with Lockyer having 25 possessions and kicking 2 goals.  2010  In and out of the side for the 2010 season, including being named as an emergency for both the Grand Final and replay, he played 11 games before retiring at the end of the season. He has been named as the Coach of the VFL Side for the 2011 Season.

Early life  Sarkhosh's inspiration was his older brother Sarwar Sarkhosh, a nationalist and legendary musician of his times who was killed during the civil war. Sarkhosh learned playing dambura and singing from him at the age of seventeen. After the death of his brother Sarkhosh migrated to Pakistan first to Peshawar city then moved to Quetta.  Career  Sarkhosh revived his skills by singing and composing songs inspired by a sense of nationalism and suffering in exile. He didn't sing for commercial gain, but out of nostalgia and to convey the feelings about refugee life as experienced by refugees of Afghanistan dispersed throughout the world. They went to his concerts in their thousands, marking Sarkhosh's rise as a singer. It was in Quetta that he mastered the harmonium under the Pakistani composer Arbab Ali Khan.

The head office is in Passenger Terminal 2, Changi Airport, Changi, Singapore. It was formed on 1 August 2016 as a restructuring of the Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of Singapore.  Structure and Responsibilities  The TSIB consists of the following entities: * Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) * Marine Safety Investigation Branch (MSIB) The AAIB is responsible for the investigation of air accidents and serious incidents in Singapore involving both local and foreign commercial aircraft. The AAIB also participates in overseas investigations of accidents and serious incidents involving Singapore aircraft or aircraft operated by a Singapore air operator. The AAIB conducts investigations in accordance to the Singapore Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents Order 2003) and Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation which governs the member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization that conducts these investigations. The MSIB is responsible for the investigation of very serious marine casualties within Singapore territorial waters, as well as accidents involving Singapore-registered ships. The MSIB carries out investigations in accordance with the Code of International Standards and Recommended Practices for a Safety Investigation into a Marine Casualty or Incident of the International Maritime Organization. It took over the role of conducting independent safety investigations from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. For an investigated accident or incident, the TSIB will produce an investigation report. The investigative process involves the collection and analysis of data, from which causes and contributing factors are determined. Whenever safety issues are identified, the TSIB may make safety recommendations.  History  The AAIB was set up in 2002 after the SilkAir Flight 185 and Singapore Airlines Flight 006 crashes. The bureau set up a facility in 2007 to analyze data from flight data recorders (informally known as \\"black boxes\\") installed on commercial aircraft. On 1 August 2016, the AAIB was restructured and subsumed into an entity within TSIB.

Until then, the Welsh had a patronymic naming system. History In 1292, 48 per cent of Welsh names were patronymics, and in some parishes over 70 per cent. Other names were derived from nicknames, a few non-hereditary personal names and, rarely, occupational names. Patronymic names changed from generation to generation, with a person's baptismal name being linked by ap, ab (son of) or ferch (daughter of) to the father's baptismal name. For example, Evan son of Thomas would be known as Evan (ap) Thomas; Evan's son, John, would be John (ab) Evan; and John's son Rees would be Rees (ap) John. Patronymics could be extended with names of grandfathers and earlier ancestors, to perhaps the seventh generation. Names such as Llewelyn ap Dafydd ab Ieuan ap Gruffudd ap Meredydd were not uncommon. Those extended patronymics were essentially a genealogical history of the male line. The Encyclopedia of Wales surmises that the system may have been Welsh law, in which it was essential for people to know how people were descended from an ancestor. These laws were decaying by the later Middle Ages, and the patronymic system was gradually replaced by fixed surnames, although the use of patronymic names continued up until the early 19th century in some rural areas. In the reign of Henry VIII surnames became hereditary amongst the Welsh gentry, and the custom spread slowly amongst commoners. Areas where England's influence was strong had abandoned patronymics earlier, as did town families and the wealthy. New surnames retained the ap in several cases, mainly in reduced form at the start of the surname, as in Upjohn (from ap John), Powell (from ap Hywel), Price (from ap Rhys), Pritchard (from ap Richard), and Bowen (from ab Owen). Alternatively, the ap was simply dropped entirely. The most common surnames in modern Wales result from adding an s to the end of the name, as in Jones, Roberts and Edwards. Patronymic surnames with the short -s form are recorded in various parts of England dating back to the Middle Ages. As most Welsh surnames are derived from patronymics, and often based on a small set of first names, Welsh communities have families bearing the same surnames who are not related. It cannot be assumed that two people named Jones, even in the same village, must have inherited the surname from a common ancestor. It is not uncommon for five or more of the starting fifteen for the Wales international rugby team to be named Jones (all of the following played in the same period and are not immediately related to any of the others: Adam R. Jones, Dafydd Jones, Ryan Jones, Stephen Jones, Mark Jones, Adam M. Jones, Alun Wyn Jones, Duncan Jones). The prevalence of names such as Jones, Williams and Thomas brought a need for further distinction and in the 19th century a trend started for double surnames, created by prefixing the name of a house, parish or the mother's surname, as in \\"Cynddylan Jones\\". A hyphen was sometimes later introduced, for example \\"Griffith-Jones\\". Present day The stock of Welsh surnames is small. This is partly attributable to the reduction in the variety of baptismal names after the Protestant Reformation. Typical Welsh surnames ‚Äì Evans, Jones, Williams, Davies, Thomas ‚Äì were found in the top ten surnames recorded in England and Wales in 2000. An analysis of the geography of Welsh surnames commissioned by the Welsh Government found that 718,000 people in Wales, nearly 35% of the Welsh population, have a family name of Welsh origin, compared with 5.3% in the rest of the United Kingdom, 4.7% in New Zealand, 4.1% in Australia, and 3.8% in the United States. A total of 16.3 million people in the countries studied had a name of Welsh origin. Revival of patronymics Although the vast majority of Welsh surnames are family names, there has been a limited revival of patronymics in modern Wales, especially among Welsh speakers. Alternatively, given surnames are used, as in the case of the folk singer and political figure Dafydd Iwan (Dafydd Iwan Jones), opera singer Bryn Terfel (Bryn Terfel Jones), classical singer Sh√¢n Cothi, and the late actress Myfanwy Talog.

Format Launching in March 1989 with the Number 1 album Deep Heat, the brand achieved a successful four-year run and set the footprint for dance music compilations for many years to come. The record company, which had formed in 1982, had achieved modest success with dance-themed multi-artist compilation albums with notable successes in the genre including the Dance Mix collections of 1987 and 1988 and The Best of House '88. What was initially unique about the Deep Heat collections was that they contained exclusive 12\\" remixes of recent club hits, instead of extended versions of chart hits featured on similar collections such as Now Dance 89 which was charting around the same time as the first Deep Heat albums. The success of the series was partly due to the CD boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s and it was the first time full 12\\" mixes could be commercially bought on Compact Disc, offering the listener at home a whole new experience of enjoying digitally enhanced dance music. Tracks on the first and longest running release kicked off with Adeva's version of \\"Respect\\" while underground favourites such as \\"Break 4 Luv\\" by Raze and Hithouse's \\"Jack to the Sound of The Underground (Acid Mix)\\" ensured the album reached the top of the newly created Compilation Chart, the first of many. Vinyl was still relatively popular with DJs and this format of Deep Heat sold well with each volume being released on vinyl when other companies such as Arcade (who came on board in 1991 with the Groovy Ghetto series) had largely abandoned the format, preferring to concentrate on packing as many tracks as they could onto a 74-minute single CD. Also unique to the Deep Heat Compilations was that there would often be 'exclusive remixes' of tracks, such as the megamix of Technotronic's biggest hits. This appeared on Deep Heat 7 ~ Seventh Heaven several months before the track was commercially released, while \\"Exclusive Deep Heat\\" mixes of tracks by The KLF featured on later editions. It would be these 'exclusive tracks' that would form the focal point of Deep Heat's extensive television advertising campaigns launched by Telstar to promote each release. These would feature clips of videos of the album's biggest club hits, usually with graphics in the style of the album's theme on the sleeve. Chart success During 1989, Telstar saw each of their five Deep Heat compilations reach the UK Compilation Chart Top 5, the first four peaked at either #1 or #2, all gaining Gold BPI Awards for UK sales over 250,000. The December release Fight The Flame collected the biggest hits of the year and became one of Telstar's four Platinum selling albums of 1989. An influx of similar releases appeared on rival labels, including Stylus collections, The Right Stuff ~ Remix 89 and Where's The House? who also teamed up with another rival K-Tel for Hip House ~ The Deepest Beats in Town. During 1990, another five Deep Heat albums were released each with declining popularity. This was due in part to a general swamping of the compilation market of dance collections, with EMI Virgin PolyGram increasing their dance album output with an unprecedented three volumes of their Now Dance spin-off, while a newcomer in the TV-advertised concept-compilation field, Dino Entertainment, would go on to steal the Deep Heat thunder with their Hardcore series that they launched in early 1991. Telstar only added to this 'swamping' effect by launching Get On This! in 1990, and then replacing it with Thin Ice the following year to run concurrently with Deep Heat, often containing very similar track listings. Another factor was the difficulty in licensing tracks from different record companies. By 1991, the major companies were either keeping tracks for their own compilations, or wanting high licensing fees. Furthermore, later editions of the series featured edited 7\\" Mixes so that each album could contain more tracks, mainly to compete with the other albums on the market. This served however to make them less popular with serious dance music buyers who liked the series' earlier 'underground' feel with rarities and remixes. Cover artwork The packaging of each album was also a factor of the album's popularity, with often a striking design gracing the front and interior packaging. Earlier themes revolved around fire, heat, flames, temperatures and burning - metaphorically suggesting the tracks will make the dancefloor burn (an idea used again later with the Megabass track.) Later releases, such as Deep Heat 6 ~ The Sixth Sense used mystic symbols as a theme; Deep Heat 7 ~ Seventh Heaven cools down the collection with heavenly blue skies and angelic artwork; Deep Heat 9 ~ Ninth Life Kiss The Bliss features Egyptian monuments praising heavenly skies and Deep Heat 10 ~ The Awakening contains graphics of an alien being.

It differed from the previous releases in that it was a single CD compilation rather than a double collection released between 1989 and 1991. Re-introduced as a dance companion to the Hits Album series Telstar had effectively relaunched with BMG in January 1993, the Deep Heat version was unsuccessful. It reached #3, bowing out of the Compilation Chart just 7 weeks later. The planned follow-up was never compiled.  Megamixes  An interesting addition to Telstar's marketing of Deep Heat was the release of a Megamix of the biggest hits from two albums; Feed The Fever and The Sixth Sense. This was the first time the Megamix had been used to promote a compilation series, but Telstar would use the gimmick again with the Megabass series (itself a compilation of Megamixes) and a Technotronic Remix Compilation in 1990. To promote the releases of both Deep Heat 1989 ~ Fight the Flame and Deep Heat 6 ~ The Sixth Sense, Telstar released Megamixes under the guise Latino Rave on 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl, and CD single, each featuring the biggest dance hits from each album. Latino Rave ‚Äì Deep Heat '89 (12/89. #12. 11 wks) This Megamix consisted of original excerpts of the following tracks; \\"Pump up the Jam\\" by Technotronic; \\"Stakker Humanoid\\" by Stakker; \\"A Day in the Life\\" by Black Riot; \\"Work it to the Bone\\" by LNR, \\"I Can Dance\\" by Fast Eddie; \\"Voodoo Ray\\" by A Guy Called Gerald; \\"Numero Uno\\" by Starlight; \\"Bango (To The Batmobile)\\" by The Todd Terry Project; \\"Brake 4 Love\\" by Raze; and \\"Don't Scandalise Mine\\" by Sugar Bear. Latino Rave ‚Äì The Sixth Sense (03/90. #49. 2 wks) This release coincided with the release of Deep Heat ~ The Sixth Sense and consisted of excerpts of the following tracks; \\"Get Up (Before The Night is Over)\\" by Technotronic; \\"The Magic Number\\" by De La Soul; \\"G'Ding G'Ding (Do You Wanna)\\" by Anna G; \\"Show 'M The Bass\\" by MC Miker G; \\"Eve Of The War\\" by Project D; and \\"Moments in Love\\" by 2 To The Power. A similar marketing ploy was successfully used on the next major Telstar Dance series Megabass. Other Telstar dance collections Telstar continued to thrive in the Dance Compilation market with fresh ideas following the demise of the Deep Heat brand in Spring 1993. Some titles ran concurrently. * Get On This!!! ~ launched in Spring 1990, the series featured mainstream Dance music, similar to EMI's Now Dance. Despite a promising start, the second volume didn't sell as well as the first and the strand was discontinued. * Thin Ice ~ launched as a companion to the established, although stalling Deep Heat series in 1991, these collections were the 'cooler' counterparts, opposing Deep Heat's theme of fire with its own element of cool ice, hence the sub-titles The First Step (presumably onto the ice) and The Second Shiver (brrrr it's cold). The other main difference was that all the tracks on Thin Ice were present in their 12\\" form, or at least in some variation to the standard Radio Edit. * The Best of Dance ~ these collections replaced the Deep Heat yearly collections and ran from 1991 to 1999. These albums concentrated purely on Dance hits from the Top 40 rather than underground club hits. * Kaos Theory ~ released in response to the Hardcore fad of 1992 and ran for four volumes. The name of the series had shortened to KT4 by the fourth volume. * Megabass ~ Three volumes of Megamixes of big club hits released between 1990 and 1991. The single Megamix Time To Make The Floor Burn was released to promote the first volume and it reached #16 in October 1990. * 100% Dance ~ part of the extensive '100%' range, which started in 1993 with 100% Dance and spun off into many other genres including Reggae, Rap, Acid Jazz, Hip hop and others. The final 'Dance' edition was Volume 4 in 1994, although there would be a form of Dance compilation (such as 100% Dance Hits 96) using the 100% Dance tag until 1997. *Clubzone ~ Telstar's 1995 Dance series lasted just two Volumes. * Clublife ~ now faced with increased competition in the Compilation market in the late 1990s, this series saw an interesting spin on Compilations by using the Record Labels the tracks had been licensed from as part of the concept; including Hooj Choons, Multiply and React. A thoughtful idea lasted just two editions in 1998. * Clubcuts ~ this series Capitalised on the Mix album concept that caught on in the late 1990s. Clubcuts lasted three volumes in 1997, all editions mixed by kiss 100 & Club DJ Graham Gold). 2 of the albums achieved Gold Status and the other went Silver. * Euphoria ~ the biggest and probably most well-known Telstar brand, launched in 1999, effectively jettisoning all other Dance titles Telstar had used up until then. Originally 'Digitally Mixed' by Red Jerry, Matt Darey, Agnelli and Nelson, Alex Gold and perhaps most famously, Radio 1 DJ Dave Pearce. When Telstar closed in 2004, the name transferred to the Ministry of Sound label. *Breakdown (As Euphoria explored darker territory, Breakdown launched in 2000 to re-capture the 'euphoric' sound of Trance.)

Cardinal In 1375, in the Consistory of 20 December 1375, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Gregory XI, and appointed Cardinal Priest of the titular church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome.Eubel, p. 22. He accompanied Gregory XI on his return to Rome in 1376 and was present at the Pope's death in the Vatican on 27 March 1378.Baluze (1693) I, p. 1142 [ed. Mollat, II (1927), p. 663].

Twemlow, Calendar of Papal Registers relating to England and Ireland Volume V, p. 208 (6 October 1399). On 15 June 1376 Pope Gregory appointed Cardinal Guy to be a Canon in the Cathedral of Krakow. On 8 January 1377 he was granted the Priory of Verasenus in the diocese of Vienne, a dependency of the monastery of La Chaise-Dieu.Baluze (1693), I, p. 1144 [ed. Mollat I (1927), p. 666]. He was Archdeacon of Condroz in the Church of Li√®ge (from 1377).Ursmer Berli√®re, OSB, Bulletin de la Commission Royale d' histoire 75 (Bruxelles 1906), 168-171. These were, to be sure, income-producing benefices rather than residential appointments; the custom was for a papal dispensation for non-residence to be issued every three years. Schism He participated in the riotous election of April 1378, from which came Urban VI (Archbishop Bartolommeo Prignano), who was, however, repudiated by all the cardinals who had elected him under conditions of force and fear (metus et impressio). According to the narration of events sanctioned by Prignano himself, the \\"Casus Urbani VI\\", the Limousin cardinalsJean de Cros, Guillaume de Agrifolio, Guy de Malsec, G√©rard du Puy, OSBClun., and Petrus de Vernio. met immediately after the death of Pope Gregory XI, and decided that their candidate would be Guy de Malsec. When opposition to any Limousin papal relative developed, however, they switched their support to Pierre de Vergne.Baronio (ed. Theiner), Vol. 26, p. 333, under the year 1378, ¬ß 79. Cardinal de Luna testified that a few days before the April Conclave began, Pierre de Verge had a majority of the electors on his side. But the riotous Roman crowds, led by their Bandarenses, changed the whole situation. At a new Conclave, held in safety in Fondi on 20 September 1378, the same cardinals (minus one, who had died, and with the addition of Cardinal Jean de la Grange, who had arrived in Rome in the meantime) elected Cardinal Robert of Geneva, who took the name Pope Clement VII. On 18 December 1378 Clement assigned Cardinal Guy as Apostolic Nuncio to travel to Flanders, Brabant, Scotland, England and the dioceses of Li√®ge, Utrecht, Cambrai and Tournai, to secure adherence to his papacy; Cardinal Guy departed on 31 December, and is known to have been in Paris at Easter.Baluze (1693), I, p. 1149 [ed. Mollat I (1927), p. 669]. On 10 February 1380 the Cardinal received additional powers with respect to England, Scotland and elsewhere; and on 6 March 1381 these were extended to the diocese of Reims.Bliss and Twemlow IV, pp. 240-242. He never received his safe-conduct for the realms of King Richard II, however, and thus did not travel to the British Isles. England, however, which was at war with France, had chosen not to support a French pope, and Flanders, which was allied with England, followed suit. Scotland, which hated the English and was a traditional ally of the French, supported the Avignon Obedience. He was then named Bishop of Palestrina in 1384 by Pope Clement VII, a position he held until his death in 1412.Eubel, p. 37. Given the schism of the time (1378-1416), Cardinal Guy's appointment in the Avignon Obedience was contested by Francesco Moricotti Prignani, Archbishop of Pisa, a cardinal of Urban VI (Bartolommeo Prignano) in the Roman Obedience, from 1380 to 1394. On 18 January 1394, Cardinal Guy de Malesec and Cardinal Guillaume d'Aigrefeuille were empowered by a Bull issued by Pope Clement VII to proceed to the reform of the College of Sainte-Catherine (Pampilonense) at the University of Toulouse, to the exclusion of Hugues, Bishop of Agde, the Provisor of the College. The two cardinals issued a Revised set of Statutes on 23 July. After the election of Cardinal Pedro de Luna as Pope Benedict XIII on 28 September 1394, it was the privilege of Cardinal Guy de Malsec, as Bishop of Palestrina, to ordain the new pope a priest. This took place on Saturday, 3 October. On Sunday 11 October, he was consecrated a bishop by Cardinal Jean de Neufchatel, Bishop of Ostia, and then crowned pope by the Cardinal Deacon, Hugues de Saint-Martial.Baluze (1693) I, pp. 567-568. The new Pope granted each of the cardinals a coronation/election gift of 4,000 gold florins. When Guy de Malsec wrote his will in 1407 the money had not yet been paid.Du Chesne, Preuves p. 460. He left the money which had not been paid by Benedict XIII to Benedict XIII, thereby cancelling the debt while making the Pope aware of his lapse. Benedict also granted Cardinal de Malsec certain benefices, the Archdiaconate of Lantario in the Church of Toulouse, the Priorate of Montalto in the diocese of Auch, and the Provostship of Lesinhanno (Lesignan) in the diocese of Narbonne.Du Chesne, Preuves p. 460. Repudiation, reconciliation, repudiation In 1398, at a meeting of the Church of Gaul, Cardinal Guy renounced his obedience to Benedict XIII, whose stubbornness was obstructing plans for an end of the Schism and a reunion of the Church. Cardinal Guy was sent to Paris in January 1399, along with Cardinal Pierre de Thury and Cardinal Amedeo di Saluzzo, to explain the decisions of the Church Council and to seek the assent of King Charles VI to the withdrawal of obedience.Franz Ehrle published their Instructions in: The Cardinals were in Paris until the end of June, when the appearance of the plague caused the entire Royal Court to take to the highway.Baluze (1693), I, p. 1150 [ed. Mollat I (1927), p. 670]. Other meetings, Councils, and negotiations continued for several years,In his Last Will and Testament, Cardinal de Malsac states that he was engaged in this journey for two years, one month and five days: Du Chesne, Preuves, p. 460. until finally, on 28 May 1403, a reconciliation and return of France to the Obedience of Benedict XIII was announced. A major part had been played by Cardinal de Malsec, who, along with Cardinal de Saluzzo, had persuaded an assembly of the French clergy on 15 May, and had spoken personally in the presence of the King and the Duke d' Orleans on 25 May in favor of the reconciliation.Franz Ehrle, \\"Neue Materialen zur Geschichte Peters von Luna,\\" in: Cardinal Guy de Malsec was Dean of the College of Cardinals, a matter of seniority, in the Obedience of Avignon from August 1405 until his death. Benedict XIII, however, continued to be under intense pressure to end the schism. He repeatedly promised to do everything he could to achieve that goal, and then found obstacle after obstacle to its realization. In May of 1408 he sent an embassy to Italy to negotiate with Pope Gregory XII (Angelo Corraro). The embassy was led by four cardinals, Guy de Malsec (Bishop of Palestrina), Pierre de Thury, Pierre Blau (who died on 12 December 1409), and Antoine de Chalant Ehrle, Archiv 7, pp. 635 and 644. In accordance with the written Instructions given them, the Cardinals were to get in touch with the cardinals of Gregory XII and sound them out as to the prospects for a General Council of the Church.Franz Ehrle, \\"Aus den Acten des Afterconcils von Perpignan 1408,\\" Archiv fur Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte 7 (1900) pp. 644-646 At Livorno the embassy happened to meet some of the cardinals of Gregory XII who had fled from his Court, which was living in exile in Lucca at the time. Those cardinals had fled on May 11 and May 12, fearing arrest and worse at the hands of that Pope's violent nephew, Paolo Corraro. Paolo had already tried unsuccessfully to seize Jean Gilles, the Cardinal of Li√®ge (who died July 1, 1408). The Gregorian cardinals were Francesco Uguccione (the Cardinal of Bordeaux), Giordano Orsini, Niccol√≤ Brancaccio and Angelo de Sommariva.F. Gregorovius, History of Rome in the Middle Ages Volume VI. 2 second edition, revised (London: George Bell, 1906) [Book XII, chapter 5], pp. 600-601. On the 29th of June of 1408, the cardinals of both Observances published a document on which they had reached agreement, pledging themselves to summon a General Council of the entire Church, and that if both papal claimants did not give peace to the Church by mutual cessation (resignation), the General Council would take action. They agreed that they would not maintain their adherence to either claimant. They agreed that they would pay no attention to the diminution in the status of any or all of them made by either claimant after 1 May 1408. They also agreed that if one of the claimants died, his cardinals would not proceed to an election, until consultation with the Church had been undertaken concerning the surviving claimant, or the claimant had resigned. The manifesto was signed by the thirteen cardinals who were present, led by Cardinal Guy de Malsec, and later subscribed to by six other cardinals. Cardinal Jean Gilles was dying and did not sign.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1409: Agreement of Cardinals at Livorno.. Retrieved: 2016-07-15. There were twenty-four living cardinals, counting both Obediences, on the day the document was signed. The opening solemnities of the Council of Pisa took place in the Cathedral on 25 March 1409. Cardinal Guy de Malsec, Bishop of Palestrina, was the senior cardinal in attendance. On 10 May the Cardinals took a preliminary vote on the deposition of the two popes, which was completely in favor, except for Cardinals Brancacci and Malsec, who asked for time for further consideration.Valois, IV, p. 99. At the fifteenth session,J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1409. Council of Pisa, Session XV. Retrieved: 2016-07-15. which took place on 5 June 1409, the two papal claimants, Benedict XIII (Pedro de Luna) and Gregory XII (Angelo Corraro), were declared to be notorious schismatics, heretics and perjurers, and were anathematized.Joannes Dominicus Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio Tomus vicesimus-septimus (Venice 1784), pp. 402-404: \\"...eorum utrumque fuisse, et esse notorios schismaticos, et antiquitati schismatis nutritores, defensores, fautores, et approbatores, et manutentores, pertinaces, necnon notorios haereticos et a fide devios, notoriisque criminibus enormis perjurii et violatione voti irrretitos, universalem ecclesiam sanctam Dei notorie scandalizantes, cum incorrigibilitate, contumacia et pertinacia notoriis, evidentibus et manifestis....\\" Conclave of 1409 With the ground cleared, the cardinals then proceeded to a papal election. The Conclave opened in the Episcopal Palace in Pisa on 15 June, a sort of Novendiales (the traditional nine days of mourning for a dead pope) being observed. Twenty three cardinals entered Conclave on the opening day, and they were joined the next day by Cardinal Antonio Calvi.Eubel I (1923), p. 32 n. 3. Cardinal Guy de Malsec presided.Valois, p. 78. There were ten cardinals of the Avignon Obedience and fourteen others. Two days before the Conclave began the cardinals had entered into an agreement that it would take at least a two-thirds vote of each of the two Obediences for a valid election, thereby ensuring that both Obediences would accept the result as valid.Edmundus Martene et Ursinus Durand, Veterum Scriptorum et Monumentorum Amplissima Collectio Tomus VII (Parisiis: apud Montalant 1733), columns 1103-1104: Verum est tamen quod aliqui dicebant dominos cardinales, praesentibus quibusdam praelatis, dum Missa celebraretur, in ists sessione existentes, retro altare jurasse se electuros unum indubitatum papam, in quem omnes consentirent, aut saltem duae partes utriusque collegii. There was a major problem. The French faction had enough votes that they could easily elect a French pope. Everyone knew that. Everyone also knew that a French pope would probably be rejected both by the followers of Gregory XII and those of Benedict XIII, and the Schism would continue. The French, therefore, had to find a candidate who would be agreeable to their faction and who would be embraced by the others as well. That person could not be a Frenchman.Valois, pp. 106-107. But the French would never accept a pope who was associated with one of their enemies in Italy, especially Ladislaus of Naples. Eventually, on 26 June 1409, the Cardinals agreed unanimously on a Franciscan from Crete who had been raised in Venice, Pietro Filargi, O.Min., who took the throne name Alexander V.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1409. Retrieved: 2016-07-16. Pope Alexander survived his election a little over ten months, dying at Bologna on his way back to Rome, in the night between 3 May and 4 May 1410.Eubel, p. 32. Gregorovius VI.2, pp. 612-613. Later years He wrote his Last Will and Testament at Avignon on 12 September 1407, adding a Codicil on 8 March 1411 Old Style (i.e. 1412), \\"laying on my sickbed, and, although weak with old age and unsound of body, healthy in mind, speaking clearly, composed in spirit, constant in faith, by no means doubting in hope, contrite and humble of heart....\\" His residual legatee was Guillaume de Malsec, the second son of Chevalier Reynaud de Rossignac.Du Chesne, Preuves, pp. 459-464. A pr√©cis is given in French in Histoire, pp. 642-644. He was sent to France in 1410 by John XXIII, the successor of Alexander V. On the death of Hugh de Montruc, Bishop of Agde (dioecesis Agathensis), a suffragan of Narbonne, on 27 July 1408, Cardinal Guy was appointed Administrator of the diocese, until a new bishop was named on 8 June 1411.Eubel, p. 76. Gallia christiana VI, pp. 692-693. In 1411, the University of Paris was so moved by the age and limited income of the Cardinal that they sent a letter to Pope John XXIII, having heard that he was about to assign the income of the diocese of Agde to someone else, begging him not to do so. The letter specifically mentions that the three-year term of appointment of Cardinal Guy was coming to an end, proving that he was not appointed the Bishop of Agde, just the Administrator during the vacancy. Death Cardinal Guy de Malsec died in Paris in the spring of 1412, either on 8 March (actually the date of the signing of the Codicil to his Will) or on 4 April (actually the date on which the Apostolic Camera first records his passing).Eubel, p. 22. Baluze (1693), I, pp. 1153-1154 [ed. Mollat I (1927), p. 673-674]. Cf. Du Chesne, Histoire, p. 644. In fact his Will was registered with the Parliament of Paris, in accordance with his Codicil, on 12 March, and in the document he is spoken of as 'deceased' ().Du Chesne, Preuves, p. 464. He was buried in the now demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris. References Bibliography * Nouvelle edition by G. Mollat II (Paris 1927). .

Drafted to the West Coast Eagles as a compensatory pick in the 1995 Pre-Season Draft, Morrison made his debut as an eighteen- year-old in Round 1 against Fremantle in 1996, after staying in Melbourne to finish year 12 studies in 1995. Dropped twice after two games, he continued to force his way back into the side and with great late form, the half-back/half- forward flanker picked up an AFL Rising Star nomination. In 1997 he showed what he was capable of, having a solid and relatively consistent year, coming third in the Club Champion Award, including a good finals series. He continued to find the ball consistently throughout his career, playing mostly as a sweeper who occasionally ran forward and kicked a goal, including a bag of four goals against the Western Bulldogs in 1998. In 2000 he was just outstanding, finding the ball at half-back as a ball magnet. He played all 22 games, and on 14 occasions he had 20 or more disposals, including 30 or more on three occasions, preferably late in the season. He averaged 23 disposals for the season, and once again came 3rd in the best and fairest. In 2001 he played most of the first half before injuring his knee, requiring a knee- reconstruction, and once again in 2002 he did the same thing, requiring a second reconstruction, ruling him out for the whole season, and almost 20 months of league footy, before he regained his skill, to yet again be injured, and only play 10 games, and his future in doubt. His next season saw him play 18 games, but he was not as dominant, as expected. He did however have a great final month and a half finding the ball. A Victorian representative earlier in his career, he was traded to Collingwood in a draft pick deal. At the Pies he managed 21 games in two seasons, with injury curtailing any opportunity of Morrison finding the same form that he had at the Eagles earlier in his career. Retirement Morrison retired after playing only 6 matches in 2006, but cited knee and back problems as the reason for his retirement. Chad Morrison returned to his adopted home Perth in 2007 to play for the Swan Districts in the WAFL and to coach the club's colts team. Winning a premiership as coach in 2007 with the likes of Nic Naitanui , Michael Walters and Jeff Garlett in the side. In 2008 and 2009 Morrison coached the East Fremantle Colts, but was starved of success at the Sharks with the likes of young up and coming players like David Swallow being unavailable for colts and playing league for a majority of the season. He finished up at the end of this season citing business opportunities as a major reason. Since 2010 Morrison has run a very successful personal training business in Perth area called Chad Morrison Fitness. Morrison also does a lot of guest speaking events for major corporations. Since the end of 2017, Chad has returned to the West Coast Eagles in the capacity of an Assistant Coach of the Women's AFL side.

He was an Usta≈°a and a functionary in the fascist puppet state called the Independent State of Croatia. Early life Draganoviƒá was born in Matiƒái, Austro-Hungary (now part of Bosnia and Herzegovina). He attended secondary school in Travnik and studied theology and philosophy in Sarajevo. Draganoviƒá was ordained a priest on 1 July 1928. From 1932 to 1935, he studied at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and Gregorian University in Rome. In 1937, his German language doctoral dissertation, titled Massen√ºbertritte von Katholiken zur Orthodoxie im kroatischen Sprachgebiet zur Zeit der T√ºrkenherrschaft (Mass conversions of Catholics to Orthodoxy in the Croatian-speaking area during the Turkish rule) was published. This later was used by the Usta≈°e as a justification for forced conversions to Catholicism. In 1935, he returned to Bosnia, initially as secretary to Archbishop Ivan ≈†ariƒá. World War II and Ratlines Draganoviƒá was an Usta≈°e lieutenant-colonel and the vice chief of the Bureau of Colonization. He oversaw confiscation of Serb property in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was the Jasenovac concentration camp military chaplain for some time until Aloysius Stepinac sent him in mid-1943 to Rome as the second unofficial Usta≈°e representative. Arriving in Rome in August 1943, Draganoviƒá became secretary of the Croatian 'Confraternity of San Girolamo', based at the monastery of San Girolamo degli Illirici in Via Tomacelli. This monastery became the centre of operations for the Croat ratline, as documented by CIA surveillance files. He is believed to have been instrumental in the escape to Argentina of the Croatian wartime dictator Ante Paveliƒá. Ante Paveliƒá hid for two years, from 1945 to 1948, in Italy under the protection of Draganoviƒá and the Vatican, before surfacing in Buenos Aires in Argentina. Officers of the United States Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) detachment responsible for Austria had this to say about Draganoviƒá, who was \\"employed\\" by the CIC because they wanted to use his pre-existing ratline (he had been obtaining passports from the Red Cross and visas from various South American countries for Usta≈°e use, thus enabling their escape from Italia to the Americas): > Draganovich is known and recorded as a Fascist, war criminal, etc., and his > contacts with South American diplomats of a similar class are not generally > approved by US State Department officials. Through his ratline, with assistance from the CIC, Draganoviƒá played a major role in helping notorious Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie flee from Europe. The two maintained a friendly relationship. Asked by Barbie why he was going out of his way to help him escape to Juan Peron's Argentina, he responded: \\"We have to maintain a sort of moral reserve on which we can draw in the future.\\"Mark Falcoff, Peron's Nazi Ties, Time, 9 November 1998, vol 152, n¬∞19 Draganoviƒá was central to many allegations involving the Vatican Bank, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Nazi Party. Declassified CIA documents confirm that Draganoviƒá was a member of the Usta≈°e, who murdered between 330,000 and 390,000 Orthodox Serbs and about 32,000 Jews. Draganoviƒá was accused of laundering the Usta≈°e's treasure of jewellery and other items stolen from war victims in Croatia.J.

In 2002, declassified CIA documents revealed that Draganoviƒá worked as a spy for the CIA from 1959‚Äì62 for the purpose of gathering intelligence on the Communist but non-aligned regime of Yugoslavia, at the time headed by Tito. His employment with the CIA was eventually terminated as he was considered to be unreliable.\\"More CIA Records Opened Under Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act\\", fas.org, May 2002; accessed 1 January 2016. According to the CIA, Draganoviƒá was \\"not amenable to control, too knowledgeable of unit personnel and activity, demand[ed] outrageous monetary tribute and U.S. support of Croat organizations as partial payment for cooperation.\\" In 1945, Draganoviƒá printed his Mali hrvatski kalendar za godinu 1945 (Small Croatian Calendar for the year 1945) in Rome for Croatian emigrants.Berislav Jandriƒá, Savezniƒçki izbjegliƒçki logori, poƒçeci otpora hrvatske politiƒçke emigracije komunistiƒçkom re≈æimu u domovini (logor Fermo), 1945. Razdjelnica hrvatske povijesti. Zagreb, p. 313 Return to Yugoslavia Some mystery surrounds Draganoviƒá's later defection to Yugoslavia. After World War II, he lived in Italy and Austria gathering evidence of communist crimes committed in Yugoslavia. He was wanted by Yugoslavia's Department of State Security (UDBA). On 10 November 1967, the Yugoslavian state attorney declared that Draganoviƒá was in Sarajevo‚Äîas a free man, as Yugoslav authorities reportedly sought information from Draganoviƒá in exchange for granting him freedom. He was supposed to \\"tell-all\\", name his colleagues and like-minded people, hand his archive over to Tito's agents, make some positive remarks about Communist Yugoslavia and in return, Belgrade would waive judicial condemnation and imprisonment. UDBA held Draganoviƒá in Belgrade for 42 days and once the investigation against him concluded he appeared in Sarajevo where he held a press conference (on 15 November 1967) at which he praised the \\"democratisation and humanising of life\\" under Tito. He denied claims made by the Croatian diaspora press that he had been kidnapped or entrapped by the UDBA. Draganoviƒá spent his last years in Sarajevo forming a new general register of the Roman Catholic Church in Yugoslavia. Draganoviƒá died in Sarajevo on 5 July 1983.

Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. 61 (1): 97‚Äì117. doi:10.4202/app.00126.2014 Most forms had large serrated spines extending backwards from the neck. Xenacanthus had characteristic teeth. Most Xenacanthus died out at the end of the Permian in the Permian Mass Extinction, with only a few forms surviving into the Triassic period (Mooreodontus). The foundation of the tooth is prolonged linguistically with a circlet button and a basal tubercle on the oral and aboral surfaces individually. Xenacanthida‚Äôs teeth are famed by articulated bones, cephalic vertebrae and isolated teeth and found global in each aquatic and clean environment. The family Xenacanthidae consist of five generals that are Xenacanthus, Triodus, Plicatodus, Mooreodontus and Wurdigneria; all of these are distinguished by cross sections of the points, crown center, length of the median edge, type of vertical cristae, and microscopic anatomy. These kinds of fishes are largely marked from Paleozoic remains and their diversity cut drastically throughout the period of their extinction. Xenacanthida's preserved tooth anatomy is used to classify new species into taxons. Group one is classified by tricuspid crown containing two stout, slightly diverging lateral cusps pointing in the same direction, a high median cusp, crown-base angle almost at 90 degrees, large, rounded, apical button with several foramina and multiple, 8-9 coarse vertical cristae on all the cusps. Group 2 is determined by bicuspid crowns with two upright, asymmetric cusps, where the medial cusp is thicker than the distal one, and consistently lack a median cusp.Bhat, M.

It was named after Erik the Red, the founder of the first Norse or Vikings settlements in Greenland in the 10th century. The Permanent Court of International Justice ruled against Norway in 1933, and the country subsequently abandoned its claims.Legal Status of Eastern Greenland , PCIJ Series A/B No. 53 (1933) The area had an Inuit population, but the last member was seen in 1823 by Douglas Clavering in Clavering Island. By 1931, that part of Greenland was uninhabited and included only three main Norwegian stations (Jonsbu, Myggbukta and Antarctic Havn) and numerous smaller ones.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008  Origin of the claim  The first European settlement in Greenland was established by Norse colonists from Iceland around the year 1000. There were two main Norse settlements on Greenland, but both were on the southwestern coast of the island, far away from the area that later became Erik the Red's Land. From the 1260s the Norse colony in Greenland recognized the King of Norway as its overlord. When Norway was under Danish rule as part of Denmark-Norway, from 1537 until 1814, official documents made it clear that Greenland was part of Norway.D√∂rr (2004), p. 103 However, contact with the settlements there was lost in the Late Middle Ages and the Norse population died out, possibly around 1500. Centuries later a Dano-Norwegian evangelist, Hans Egede, heard about the Norse colony on Greenland. He then asked King Frederick IV of Denmark for permission to try to find the long-lost colony and eventually to establish a Protestant Christian mission there to convert the population of the land, who were presumed, if any survived, to still be Catholic or to have completely lost the Christian faith. Egede reached Greenland in 1721, and finding no Norse population there, started his mission among the Inuit people. This led to his becoming known as the \\"Apostle of Greenland\\" and he was appointed Bishop of Greenland. He founded the current capital of Greenland, called Godthaab. In 1723, The Bergen Greenland Company (Det Bergenske Gr√∏nlandskompani) received a concession for all trade with Greenland.karmoybladet.no For the remainder of the union between Norway and Denmark, the relationship between Greenland and the state was organised in different ways. Modern historians disagree as to what point in history Greenland went from being a Norwegian possession to being a Danish one. However, the Treaty of Kiel, signed in 1814, indicates that Greenland was at least politically regarded as having been Norwegian: \\"...the Kingdom of Norway ... as well as the dependencies (Greenland, the Faroes and Iceland not included) ... shall for the future belong to ... His Majesty the King of Sweden ...\\".\\"Dessa Biskopsd√∂men, Stift och Provinser, innefattande hela Konunga-Riket Norrige med alla dess Inbyggare, St√§der, Hamnar, F√§stningar, Byar och √ñar utmed hela detta Rikes kuster, tillika med deras tillh√∂righeter (Gr√∂nland, Ferr√∂arne och Island h√§r under likw√§l icke inbegripne); √§fwensom de med alla f√∂rmoner, r√§ttigheter och afkastningar skola h√§danefter under full √§go och √∂fwerherreskap tillh√∂ra Hans Maj:t Konungen af Swerige, och utg√∂ra ett Konunga-Rike f√∂renadt med Swerige.\\", The Treaty of Kiel Norway never recognised the validity of the Treaty of Kiel.  History  Raising of the Norwegian flag at Myggbukta, Eirik Raudes Land. In 1919, Denmark claimed the whole of Greenland as its territory, with Norway's acquiescence (see Ihlen Declaration). However, in 1921, Denmark proposed to exclude all foreigners from Greenland, creating diplomatic conflict until July 1924, when Denmark agreed that Norwegians could establish hunting and scientific settlements north of 60¬∞27' N. In June 1931, Hallvard Devold, one of the founders of the Norwegian Arctic Trading Co., raised the Norwegian flag at Myggbukta and on 10 July 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation was issued, claiming Eastern Greenland as Norwegian territory. Norway claimed that the area was terra nullius: it had no permanent inhabitants and was for the most part used by Norwegian trappers and fishermen. The area was defined as \\"situated between Carlsberg Fjord in the South and Bessel Fjord in the North\\", extending from latitude 71¬∞30' to latitude 75¬∞40'N. Although it was not explicitly stated in the proclamation itself, it was assumed that the area was limited to the eastern coast, so that the Inland Ice constituted its western limit. (The Inland Ice covers five sixths of Greenland's total area, so that only a narrow strip of varying width along the coast is free of permanent ice.) Norway and Denmark agreed to settle their dispute over Eastern Greenland in what became known as the \\"Greenland case\\" (Gr√∏nlandssaken) at the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1933. Norway lost and after the ruling it abandoned its claim. During the 1940-1945 German occupation of Norway in World War II, the territorial claim was briefly revived by the puppet Quisling regime, which extended it to cover all of Greenland. A small-scale invasion to \\"reconquer\\" the island for Norway was proposed by Vidkun Quisling, but the Germans rejected this after deeming it not feasible in light of the then ongoing Battle of the Atlantic.Busk√∏-aff√¶ren - hvordan ei norsk selfangstskute ble USAs f√∏rste fangst i andre verdenskrig, Artikkel i tidsskriftet Historie nr 1, 2007  See also  *Antarctic Haven *Cartographic expeditions to Greenland *King Christian X Land *Finnsbu and Torgilsbu, part of a simultaneous claim in Southeast Greenland  References  Bibliography *  External links  * Full Text of the PCIJ Judgment: Legal Status of Eastern Greenland (Den. v.

This hospital provides general and acute care, as well as a comprehensive range of clinical specialties and sub-specialties, including obstetrics and gynaecology, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT) and ophthalmology. Various ancillary services such as rehabilitation therapy and imaging services are also available.  History  Parkway East Hospital began its operations in 1942 and was known as the Paglar Clinic and Maternity Hospital. It was founded by Dr Paglar, a Eurasian general practitioner. In 1974, his descendants sold the hospital to an Englishman, Dr Leo Taylor, and it was renamed Saint Mark's Maternity Hospital. Two years later, the hospital was sold to Hong Leong Group for residential purposes. However, the land was zoned for hospital use. Another doctor, Dr Sundarson, together with a group of businessmen and doctors bought the property from Hong Leong. The new owners refurbished and modernised the existing facilities, and renamed it Saint Mark's Hospital. The 45-bed hospital commenced operations in 1974 with Obstetrics and Gynaecology wards. In 1977, Dr Yahya Cohen together with American Medical International (AMI) entered a joint venture with the former to form Saint Mark's AMI Pte Ltd. Saint Mark's Hospital further expanded with a purchase of a 40,000 sqft site adjacent to the existing building in 1982. With the expansion, the hospital's capacity also increased to 49 beds. In 1983, AMI took over the hospital and it was renamed The American Hospital of Singapore. After many years of operation, the hospital was acquired by Parkway Holdings Limited and was renamed East Shore Hospital. Under the new management, East Shore Hospital became a general acute care hospital integrated with a medical specialist centre and a 24-hour clinic. In 2010, East Shore Hospital was renamed Parkway East Hospital. Medical High School programme Sixty high school students aged 15 to 18 from Victoria Junior College, Victoria School and Dunman High School participated in a \\"Medical High School\\" training programme sponsored by the hospital in March and April 2015. The students experienced first hand the world of a medical professional and got to chance to participate in some medical emergency scenarios. The idea of the programme, according to hospital CEO Phua Tien Beng, was to allow the students \\"to actually experience working in a hospital with real patients\\".  Initiatives  One of the initiatives organized by Parkway East Hospital is the Doctor For a Day (DFAD). It is an event designed for children living in the East to role-play as doctors in a real hospital setting. The objective of the event is to educate and inspire children to be part of the medical community. The first event was conducted in April 2014.  Partnerships  In 2013, Pathway Genomics Corporation, a San Diego-based clinical laboratory that offers genetic testing services internationally, partnered with Parkway Laboratory Services Ltd, an ancillary service of Parkway Pantai Limited to offer Pathway Fit, a comprehensive saliva-based nutrigenetic test that reports on a patient's genetic propensity for diet, nutritional needs, metabolic health factors and food reactions. 2013 also saw the formation of a partnership between Sengenics, a genetic diagnostics company and Parkway Laboratory Services to provide genetic tests in Singapore including Sengenics CardioSURE Heart disease genetic risk test and Sequenom's MaterniT21 PLUS non- invasive pre-natal diagnostic test that covers Trisomy 21, 18 and 13. In 2014, Parkway East Hospital, together with other hospitals under the group of Parkway Hospitals, works in close partnership with Parkway Patient Assistance Centre in providing services.  Innovations  Parkway East Hospital adopted the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and implemented it in 2015. It is implemented with the intention to reduce paper wastage by having a centralized storage for patients' details and medical records. The Closed Loop Medication Management (CLMM) and Knowledge-Based Medication Administration (KBMA) modules were rolled out in 2016 and 2017 respectively to enhance the accuracy of the order and administration of medications to patients. Electronic Meal Ordering System (eMOS) was implemented in 2016 to transform a manual paper-based meal ordering process into a fully integrated electronic meal ordering system. This involves a tablet application for food ordering service, back end application for hospital kitchen operations, nutrition and dietary management as well as automated food allergy checking. This system aims to improve the efficiency of the meal ordering process.

It is no longer included in the X11 reference distribution, having been removed with X11R6.7 in 2004.

XIE also provided import and export facilities for moving images between client and server, and for accessing images as resources. The client side programming library, XIElib, was documented in the Prentice Hall book Developing Imaging Applications with XIElib by Syd Logan (). In addition to the server and client library, a performance and test tool, xieperf, was included in X11R6. This client was also written by Syd Logan. XIE was developed under contract to the X Consortium by a San Diego, CA company (no longer extant) called AGE Logic. Principal team members include Larry Hare, Bob Shelley, Dr. Dean Verheiden, Dr. Ben Fahey, Dr. Gary Rogers, and Syd Logan. For all practical purposes, the Image Extension is obsolete.

The newly formed IRA \\"left New London in frustration and disgust\\" next year and selected a permanent site for its own annual regatta in June 1895.Mallory, p. 323. The very first IRA race was held in June 1895, on the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, with one Varsity Eight team from Cornell, Columbia and Pennsylvania competing. Cornell won with a time of 21:25.0. The course was a straight four miles, wide enough for 20 boats.Mallory, p. 324. In 1899 there were 48 cars in the observation train that slowly followed the race as \\"a moving grandstand\\" (on the heights above the river).Mallory, p. 327. People soon named the championship regatta after its permanent location and the name Poughkeepsie Regatta was used on the cover of the official program from 1922.\\"Programs\\". Intercollegiate Rowing Association: Poughkeepsie Regatta. Marist Archives & Special Collections. Marist College. Retrieved 2013-05-16. In the early years the Eastern schools dominated the race. Typically only a four-mile Varsity Eight race was held, but if there were enough teams entered, there was also a two-mile Freshman Eight race, and occasionally a Varsity Four race. Eventually, this evolved into a format that included an annual two-mile Freshman Eight race, followed by a three-mile Junior Varsity Eight race, and finally the four-mile Varsity Eight race. In 1923 the University of Washington became the first Western crew team to win the Poughkeepsie Regatta. From that year on the Western schools that participated, namely the University of Washington, and the University of California, became a dominating factor. They consistently placed in the top three, and more often than not, they won. The University of Washington became the first and only school to sweep the Regatta two years in a row. Spectators at the 1907 Poughkeepsie RegattaThe Regatta grew to be \\"the greatest one-day sporting event in America\\" early in the 20th century, the culmination of a \\"carnival\\" regatta week on both sides of the river.Mallory, p. 328‚Äì29. Every June tens of thousands of spectators would come pouring into Poughkeepsie to watch the races. They covered the shores next to the river, many waiting all day, picnicking on blankets, to ensure they had a good view. The railroad tracks on the west side of the river had a flatbed train which held grandstands from which spectators could watch the race. As the crews rowed up the river, the train would keep pace with them, giving the people on board the best view possible. Hundreds of boats, yachts, and occasionally even Navy destroyers sailed to Poughkeepsie, and moored on the sides of the river to watch the event. The town of Poughkeepsie came alive on the day of the Regatta, with parades, bands, vendors, and banners. In addition, colorful pennants displaying the school colors of all the participants were flying everywhere. The Regatta was extensively covered by newspaper reporters, and as time went on it was even broadcast over local and national radio stations. But the crowds, the cheers, the reporters, parades, and pennants were not the reasons why the Regatta became so intensely popular, the explanation lay in the physical feats of the crew teams. To race at full-speed for four miles required such a breathtaking amount of strength, skill, and endurance that it was awe-inspiring to watch. After 55 years, the IRA Championship Regatta moved in 1950 to Marietta, Ohio; in 1952 to Syracuse, New York; and in 1995 to Camden, New Jersey. Harvard and Yale remained self-segregated for a century, long after the IRA championship left Poughkeepsie and the Hudson River.Mallory, p. 329.

It is part of a large sports complex called the DBI Sports Complex, which houses a majority of sporting facilities used by players representing the state of Perak such as the Velodrome Rakyat (cycling), Indera Mulia Stadium (indoor stadium) and the Sultan Azlan Shah Stadium (field hockey).  Profile  Before the stadium was built, the site for the stadium was used as a prison from 1949 to 1959, known as Detention Camp to incarcerate communists during Malayan Emergency period (Darurat in Malay).http://www.prison.gov.my/portal/page/portal/hijau/berita?fac_next_page=htdocs/berita/ViewBerita.jsp?id=21 The construction of the stadium started in January 1964 and completed by June 1965, with a maximum capacity of 10,000. Two following renovations increased the stadium capacity - 1975 (18,000) and 1993 (30,000). The stadium was upgraded in 1997.World Stadiums entry on Stadium Perak for the FIFA U-20 World Cup. It was renovated in 1999 at a cost of RM 1,949,000 by the Perak state government. It was put under the administration of the Ipoh City Council, which oversees the general upkeep of the stadium until this day. Since the last refurbishment in 1997, the capacity of the stadium is 42,500 and it boasts a press box and a VIP-area which is normally used by the Sultan of Perak. The stadium features a FIFA standard football pitch and an IAAF- certified synthetic running track. The stadium also has monochromatic video matrix scoreboard. The stadium has two types of seating, which is grandstand seating and normal seating. Only those seating in the grandstand are sheltered from the elements of nature. The stadium has a notoriously problematic flood light system. There are four flood light towers surrounding the stadium and about 50% fail to light up when it is needed. Poor pitch conditions are also a norm at this stadium and coaches are known to have publicly voiced their discontent over this issue. However, the issue was settled comprehensively and the light towers are upgraded to international football standard. On 7 May 2013, Perak FA defeated Negeri Sembilan FA 2-1 in a Malaysian Super League match in the first sporting event after the stadium flood lights upgrading.  Usage  Today, the stadium is not regularly used for events other than football. Events such as military band competitions and school sports days are held at the Perak Stadium sporadically. The Perak FA, which plays its football in the Malaysian Super League, considers Perak Stadium to be its homeground and their matches are the only times when the stadium experiences capacity crowds. It is a preferred venue for football final matches when the teams involved do not originate near the Klang Valley area such as the Malaysia FA Cup final matches for 1997 (Selangor FA vs. Penang FA) and 2003 (Negeri Sembilan FA vs. Perlis FA). Some parties have criticised the Football Association of Malaysia for failing to move the finals of 2006 Malaysian FA Cup (Pahang FA vs. Perlis FA) to this stadium, where attendance levels were likely to be higher than the one eventually experienced at Bukit Jalil. The stadium also held numerous final matches or championship for FAM Cup, Piala Emas Raja-Raja, Agong Cup, Burnley Cup and Bardhan Cup.

The Book of Saints: A Dictionary of Servants of God Canonized. NP: Adam and Charles Black, 1966 He is also known as Lazarus the Painter and Lazarus the Iconographer. Born in Armenia on November 17, 810, he lived before and during the second period of Byzantine Iconoclasm.Bigham, Steven. \\"Chapter 3.\\" In Heroes of the Icon: People, Places, Events, 87-89. Torrance: Oakwood, 1998. 87-90. Lazarus is the first saint to be canonized specifically as an iconographer. He was later followed by Saint Catherine of Bologna, Theodore the Studite.  Life and times  Lazarus became a monk at an early age and is thought to have studied the art of painting at the Stoudios Monastery in Constantinople.Kaz√åidan, A.P. The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991O'Connell, Monique, Olenka Z. Pevny, and Alice-Mary Talbot. \\"Perceptions of Byzantium and Its Neighbors (843-1261).\\" Sixteenth Century Journal 33, no. 4 (2002): 24-25. Lazarus was noted to possess the following virtues: love for Christ, asceticism, prayer, and rejection of the vanities of the world.Bigham, p.88 He was further recognized for his acts of self-control, discipline and alms-giving, then made a priest. In his lifetime he was highly regarded and well known for his frescos. He used faith and ritual as a means to transcribe his inner contemplation onto the images he painted.Athanassiadis, Antony, trans. Synaxarion of Saint Nicodemus the Hagiorite. Vol. 2. Athens, 1868. 125-126. Thus, his ability to paint icons was seen as a gift given by God. During the reign of Theophilos (), an iconoclast emperor opposed to all holy images, Lazarus stubbornly continued his craft of painting icons and began restoring images defaced by heretics.O'Connell, p.25 Theophilus sought out Lazarus, who was then famous for his painting, and intended to make an example of him. After being asked several times to cease painting, Lazarus was brought before the emperor where he refused to destroy any of the images he painted. The emperor soon found that Lazarus was above flattery and bribery.Mango, Cyril. The Art of the Byzantine Empire: 312-1453: Sources and Documents. Englewood Cliffs New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1972. 158-60. He was then threatened with the death penalty, which at the time was not an uncommon outcome for those who favored icons (iconodules). However, Lazarus being a man of the cloth, could not be put to death and so he was instead thrown in prison. During his imprisonment he was subjected to such ‚Äúsevere torture that the ladders flesh melted away along with his blood.‚ÄùMango, p.159 He was left to die of his wounds but recovered. He then began to paint holy images on panels from his prison cell. Hearing of this, Theophilos gave orders to have ‚Äúsheets of red hot iron to be applied to the palms of his hands where, as a result, he lost consciousness and lay half dead.‚ÄùMango, p.159 It is also said his hands were burned with red-hot horseshoes until his flesh melted to the bone. As Lazarus lay on his deathbed, the Empress Theodora, an iconodule, convinced Theophilos to release Lazarus from prison. Lazarus found refuge at Tou Phoberou, a secluded church of St. John the Forerunner once located in Phoberos on the Asiatic shore of the Bosporus.Mango, p.159 The Church is believed to have once functioned as an imperial monastery that housed as many as one-hundred and seventy monks.Jordan, Robert, trans.\\"30.

Washington, DC: Dumbarton Oaks, 2000, 872-79. After the death of Theophilos in 842, Theodora asked Lazarus to forgive her husband‚Äôs actions, to which he replied ‚ÄúGod is not so unjust, O, Empress, as to forget our love and labors on his behalf, and attach greater value to that mans hatred and extraordinary insanity.‚ÄùMango, p.159 Lazarus served as a model of perseverance for those who had suffered from iconoclast persecution.Brubaker, Leslie. The artisanal production of second Iconoclasm (815-843) In: Monast√®res, images, pouvoirs et soci√©t√© √† Byzance. Paris: Publications de la Sorbonne, 2006, 135-152  Attributed artworks  After the restoration of the icons in 843, Lazarus was again free to pursue his painting. Despite his previous wounds, Lazarus was said to have painted a large fresco of St. John at the Phoberos Monastery.O'Connell, p. 24 The painted icon was known to have the power to perform cures and miracles.Mango, p. 159 That same year, he also famously restored a portrait of Christ known as the Christ Chalkites (Christ of the Chalke) over the Chalke Gate, a ceremonial entrance of the Great Palace of Constantinople.Mango, p.159 Neither of these two works survive today. Lazarus was also accredited with the mosaic decoration of the apse of Hagia Sophia within the pilgrim accounts of Antony, Archbishop of Novgorod during a visit to Constantinople. Antony described the mosaic as depicting the Mother of God holding a Child Christ flanked by two angels, which was noted to have been seen by both Emperor Basil l and Michael III () before his death the same year.

He primarily played as an outfielder. On June 17, 2009, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison after being found guilty of two counts of sexual assault against minors. Playing career Hall made his MLB debut in 1981 with the Chicago Cubs, and was the fifth-youngest player in the league. In his first full Major League season in 1983, Hall hit 17 home runs in 112 games. In 1987, he had the best fielding percentage and range factor of all MLB left-fielders. In 1991, when Bernie Williams was a rookie, Hall made fun of him by giving him the nickname \\"Zero\\".

Services on the Coatbridge route did not run there however, the NBR instead using a separate terminus known as College situated on the end of a short spur from the CGUR route southwest of Bellgrove. This only lasted until 1886, when the Glasgow City and District Railway was opened from via a low level station at Queen Street to join the CGUR at High Street East Junction. This was henceforth used by all services from the Coatbridge & direction and also by the newly inaugurated passenger services to Springburn (trains had been progressively introduced on the route prior to this, but only as far as ). The North British company took over the CGUR in 1896 jointly with the Glasgow and South Western Railway, operating all services on the Springburn line thereafter.

The college arrived at Monkstown Park in 1950 from Eblana Avenue in D√∫n Laoghaire via a short stint on Tivoli Road. As of September 2018, it will be in its 69th academic year of existence at Monkstown Park, the 162nd overall. The intended mission of the college's former patron, the Congregation of the Christian Brothers established in 1802 by Edmund Ignatius Rice, was the education of poor boys in Ireland by providing them with basic levels of literacy.Education - Ireland in the early 20th century This was the broad aim of the school when it opened its doors in 1856 at Eblana Avenue in what was then known as Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire), a port town south of Dublin City. As the years went by, the aims of the Christian Brothers got broader and so did those of the D√∫n Laoghaire school. By the 1920s, the school was preparing boys for the state examinations and sending increasing number of students to third level. The growth in population in D√∫n Laoghaire, with an increasing Catholic middle class demographic, led to an increase in the demand for the school. To that end, a decision was made to procure Monkstown Park in 1949 and to move the entire secondary department to this location. The school then in effect split, with the secondary department (now known as CBC Monkstown) moving location while the primary school (known as C.B.S. Eblana Avenue) remained at the original site. A private junior school was then opened at the Monkstown College with Eblana Avenue taking secondary students again from 1954. The ethos of the majority of Christian Brothers schools in Ireland in the early 20th century was a strongly nationalist and Gaelic one. Those schools were known as \\"CBS\\" and played the Irish field sports of the GAA.GAA and Catholic Church no longer hand in hand However the Monkstown school in line with their sister establishment, Christians (CBC Cork), was known as \\"CBC\\" with the more Anglosphereic sport of rugby union played as the main team game. Continuing with that differentiation, both schools would be the only 2 of the 96 Christian Brothers schools to abstain from the Free Education Act 1967, which for the first time provided free second-level education for Irish pupils. Both remain in the fee paying sector as of 2017. The school motto is Certa Bonum Certamen or \\"fight the good fight\\" and the school colours are red, black and yellow. History St Michaels Christian Brothers School Eblana Avenue, original incarnation of CBC. Continued use as the location of CBS Eblana until its closure in 1992 On 1 January 1856, the Congregation of Christian Brothers opened a school at Eblana Avenue in D√∫n Laoghaire (Kingstown as it was known then). The site was provided by Charles Kennedy, a businessman and head of the local Vincent DePaul. This was just ten years after the Great Famine, and emigration was rife. The school was called St Michaels Christian Brothers School, and initially educated mainly poor boys from the area. Brother Alphonsus Hoope was appointed as superior of the school. Kingstown during the 19th century was rapidly expanding with the harbour town seeing the addition of the piers and the Dublin and Kingstown Railway opening 20 years before the school. Hoope arranged for two rooms for teaching, which had to be expanded after three weeks to three due to demand. Within two years, a building housing 400 students was built on the site. Kennedy and the local Vincent DePaul raised funds for the school at a gala dinner at what is now the Royal Marine Hotel D√∫n Laoghaire. The day-to-day operations of the school was financed from \\"voluntary subscriptions, solicited and collected by the Brothers\\". The Brothers residence of the time was located behind the main school building. There were 6 Brothers living on the school grounds, a building separate from the main school block. The school premises was valued in 1859 at ¬£60. During World War 1, a significant number of former pupils of the school went to fight in the war, as part of the 200,000 Irishmen who participated in the war effort. The D√∫n Laoghaire area suffered over 500 military fatalities during the war, with a significant number of these coming from school. Owing to this, people in Flanders sent a statue to the area to honour the dead. It was felt at the time that the school should take it, as so many of the fatalities were from the school. With the changing political environment at the time however, with the Irish War of Independence underway, this was declined by the school. The statue was instead housed in the Dominican Covent in the town, where it resides still to this day in an oratory purposely designed for it.https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-on-first-world-war- memorials-1.2370119 The Brothers continued to have a major role in the education system when Ireland gained independence. In 1925 they vacated their premises in the school, moving to the nearby York Road, creating additional space for the school. By this time the school was focusing more on its collegiate department, with increased local competition in the area and a demand for Inter Certificate and Leaving Certificate programmes growing as a new middle class sprang up in D√∫n Laoghaire. Early pupils at the collegiate wing of the school included Dan O'Herlihy and James Dooge. The school at Eblana prospered to an extent that it became impossible to accommodate both primary and secondary departments in the 19th century buildings, with the D√∫n Laoghaire parish hall often used to hold classes. Additionally, the D√∫n Laoghaire site was an urban one, with no greenspace on the site. This was felt to hinder the college against other local schools who could provide on site sports to their students, facilities which the growing middle class demographic of the area expected.The Christian Brothers * St. Michael's College at Monkstown.

Traditions were soon adopted from CBC Cork which had been existence since the early 20th century. In 1949 the Brothers purchased the nearby estate of Monkstown Park, which had been most recently occupied by the Protestant Corrig School. In order to procure the grounds, the Brothers released lands at Rochestown Avenue to D√∫n Laoghaire Corporation which had previously been used as the schools playing pitches. Many local people wanted a public park to be maintained at the site. CBC abstained from joining the Free Education Scheme introduced by Donagh O'Malley in 1969. The primary reason for not joining the scheme was the significant capital costs involved in maintaining a school the size of CBC. CBC had always charged higher fees than their equivalent Christian Brothers schools. To this day, it remains as one of the 51 secondary schools (7% of the total) in the country that is fee paying. In 1987 the school was further extended with a new administration building including new offices, a cafeteria, staff room and technology department. In 1994, the Edmund Rice Oratory, was opened. 50 years at Monkstown Park and school redevelopment project In 2000 the college celebrated its Golden Jubilee at Monkstown Park. The school year began with a ceremonial walk from the old Eblana school site to Monkstown Park. Events included a Jubilee Concert and the opening of a wall with the names of all the pupils from the time in Monkstown from 1950 onwards, attended by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese.REMARKS BY PRESIDENT McALEESE AT THE 50th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS COLLEGE Modern day school buildings with rugby pitches in foreground In 2002 plans for a new school on the site were announced. Considerable controversy was caused in 2005 in the national media when it was announced, as CBC would receive a portion of the costs of funding the building despite being a fee-paying school from the Irish state. Subsequently, the school proceeded with the project with their own finance. In 2007 the Christian Brothers decided to transfer the trusteeship of the school to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust along with 96 other Christian Brothers schools. A new 12 classroom building opened in 2014 costing 4.5 million euro. This stands alongside the refurbished original 1840s building, the 1965 Sports Hall and the 1987 Administration Block. Motto and Crest The college motto is \\"Certa Bonum Certamen\\", Latin for \\"Fight the Good Fight\\". This is written at the top of the original building which is visible on entry to the grounds. All school announcements used to conclude with the motto. The college crest contains four elements. The college motto is below a shield containing three characters - a star, a tower and a sword. The star is the guiding star of knowledge. The tower represents the tower on the school grounds and the Christian focus of the school. The sword represents power, courage and chivalry. Buildings The college is bordered by several historical sites. Carrickbrennan Churchyard is located to the north of the school on the border of the grounds and Monkstown Castle is adjacent to the school. The college is made up of three buildings interconnected. Charles Haliday's house built in 1843 is incorporated into the main school block. The facade of the building long portico of Corinthians columns remains intact and is a protected structure. The tower opposite the main building is also a protected structure. The administrative block was built in 1987 and also contains several classrooms. The Concert hall was built in the early 1960s. Charles Haliday's Tower Folly, on the east of CBC Monkstown's grounds The current re-building will terrace the new building into \\"the hill\\" and the current buildings are to be demolished with the protected structures and part of the old house retained as part of the development. The grounds contain an athletics paddock and three rugby pitches. Academic and spiritual Academic performance The average Leaving Cert score in CBC in 2019 was 461, this compares to the national average of 335. In 2013 over 70% of CBC students achieved over 400 points in the Leaving Certificate, nationally the number achieving this was 33.7%. In addition (results nationally in brackets); 27% in CBC (3%) got over 550 points, 41% (9.4%) in CBC got over 500 points and 57% got over 450 points (20.1%). In 2014, one CBC student achieved eight A1 grades, putting him in the top 13 performers in the country In 2018, one CBC student received 8 H1 results, one of seven students in Ireland to achieve this. Senior school curriculum Part of the schools mission statement is striving for \\"academic excellence\\". Boys study for both the Junior Cert and later the Irish Leaving Cert. School hours are between 8:45 AM to 4 PM with a half day for sporting activities on Wednesdays at 1 PM. In addition sports activities sometimes take place after 4 PM and optional afternoon and night study is available. The fourth year (Transition Year) includes courses in academic subjects, as well as such optional subjects and activities as: Japanese, Sailing, Social work, Tourism, Chess-Boxing and First aid. The Comenius project is also offered which is a project linking CBC with other schools around Europe. Transition Year classes won the Com√≥rtas Scann√°n TG4 in 2005 and were finalists in 2006, the 2005 group having their film represent Ireland in Italy in 2005.

Monkstown Park Junior School The Junior School consists of around 200 boys. There are 8 full-time teachers and one principal. Extra-curricular subjects are also taught such as Computers, French, Physical Education, Speech and Drama, Singing and Musical Appreciation and Arts and Crafts. There is also a part- time remedial teacher. Tutors are available to take students studying German and Music and the school runs an activity club on Fridays. As an Independent school, it operates outside the auspices of the Department of Education, which does not control school hours, curriculum and activities. In 2014 the school became an associate member of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust network. Under new directors, the school was re-established as Monkstown Park Junior School in July 2014. Spiritual Although the Christian Brothers have departed the faculty, Religious Education is still taught. It is offered for the Junior and Leaving Certificates (as an optional subject). Religion is also taken for those who do not choose to learn it as an exam subject in the Senior Cycle. The Edmund Rice Oratory is one of the school's latest additions. A school chaplain is available to the college. Extracurricular Aid work The Zambian Immersion Project is a senior cycle project where pupils fund raise and travel to Zambia and help in charity work. Others complete An Gaisce (Presidents Award) and the Edmund Rice awards which contain significant social work. The Junior School's 6th class raise money annually for the Chernobyl Children's Project (with their charity Children Helping Children), and culminate their fund raising in a business exhibition at the end of every year. In 2007 they raised ‚Ç¨42,000 for the project. In 2008 the school started a new charity: the Edmund Rice's Children's Fund. This encourages a whole school approach. Drama, college musical and music CBC has the distinction of being the first school to ever perform in the national Theatre of Ireland, the Abbey Theatre in 1958. Class V performed Patrick Pearse's √çosag√°n under the directorship of Thomas MacAnna, a future Tony Award winner, who was the drama and elocution teacher in the school at the time. MacAnna also produced the early Gilbert and Sullivan opera performances at the school. The annual school musical, a collaboration with the nearby girls school Loreto College, Foxrock has been running for 21 years. Each respective transition year pupils participate, providing the student wishes to participate. A fifth- year drama is also produced. Writing workshops In 2015, CBC Transition Year's wrote and published a short story book, Brainstorms edited by writer Roddy Doyle. This was as part of Doyle's Fighting Words programme. Author Kevin Barry (author) wrote the introduction. Debating In 2011, CBC became the first school in the history of Leinster Schools' Debating Championships to win both the Individual and Team prizes, thus the school were Leinster's sole representatives at the All Ireland Schools' Debating Championship (Individual: Austin Conlon, Team: Kevin Dooney and Michael Barton). Conlon went on to win the Individual prize at the All Ireland Schools' Debating Championship at University College Cork whilst the Team of Dooney and Barton finished as runners up. Another team from CBC, Stephen Stack and Hugh Guidera, also represented Ireland at the Schools debating competition organised by the Oxford Union at Oxford University. Rory Conlon and Luke Murray retained the Leinster School's Debating team title in 2012 for the school. Hugh Guidera and Michael Barton reached the Grand Final of the Clifford Chance Durham University Schools' Debating Competition, one of the four \\"Majors\\" on the UK Schools Debating circuit and is the largest schools debating competition in the world.

His most important work is Le Talmud de J√©rusalem, which was commenced in 1867 or 1868, before the appearance of Zecharias Frankel's Introduction or of the special dictionaries of the Talmud. The first part appeared in 1871 and was well received, although the critics did not spare Schwab. He then sought the cooperation of the leading Talmudists; but he was unsuccessful and had to complete the work alone. In addition to his work in Talmudic studies, he also produced editions of a number of Jewish Aramaic Magic bowls, though these were described as 'incredibly poor' by one scholar.Charles Isbell, 1975; Corpus of the Aramaic incantation bowls (Dissertation Series 17, Scholars Press), Missoula, Montana, p. 10 *1882. ‚ÄúUn vase jud√©o-chald√©en de la Biblioth√®que Nationale‚Äù, REJ (Revue des √©tudes juives) 4, pp. 165‚Äì172. *1886. ‚ÄúUne coupe d'incantation‚Äù, Revue d'Assyriologie 1, pp. 117‚Äì119. *1890. ‚ÄúLes coupes magiques et l'hydromancie dans l'antiquit√© orientale‚Äù, Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology 12, pp. 292‚Äì342. *1891. ‚ÄúCoupes √† inscriptions magiques‚Äù, Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology 13, pp. 583‚Äì595. *1892. ‚ÄúDeux vases jud√©o-babyloniens‚Äù, Revue d'Assyriologie 2, pp. 136‚Äì142. *1906. ‚ÄúUne amulette jud√©o-aram√©enne‚Äù, Journal Asiatique, 2e s√©rie, 7, pp.5-17. *1910a. ‚ÄúA note on a Hebrew amulet‚Äù, PSBA 32:(155ff.). *1910b. ‚ÄúUne amulette arabe‚Äù, JA 10e s√©rie, vol. 16, pp. 341‚Äì345. *1916/7. ‚ÄúAmulets and bowls with magic inscriptions‚Äù, Jewish Quarterly Review 7, pp. 619‚Äì628.

Chris Berman, a fellow ESPN analyst, nicknamed him the \\"Candyman\\". Maldonado holds the distinction of having struck the first game-winning hit outside the United States in World Series play, and was the only Giant to hit a triple in the 1989 World Series. San Francisco Maldonado, also known as \\"The Candyman\\" and \\"The 4th Out\\", was a major part of the Giants success in the late 1980s as a part of the 1987 NL West Champions and the 1989 National League Champions. Although Maldonado had statistically good seasons in San Francisco, he was involved in one of the most infamous plays in Giants history. In game 6 of the 1987 National League Championship Series, he lost Tony Pe√±a's 2nd inning fly ball in the lights. This play resulted in a triple for Pe√±a. Pe√±a scored on a sacrifice fly for the only run of the game, which the Cardinals won to tie the series at 3 games each, before going on to win Game 7. Career highlights Maldonado at a free baseball clinic in Argentina in 2009. Over his career, Maldonado was a better hitter on the road than at home, with a batting average which was 51 points higher in road games than in home games. On May 4, 1987, he became only the 16th player in San Francisco Giants franchise history to hit for the cycle. Then in 1994, Candy scored the first-ever run for the Cleveland Indians at Jacobs Field. In Game 3 of the 1992 World Series, playing for the Toronto Blue Jays, he hit a walk-off hit off Atlanta Braves closer Jeff Reardon and also hit a solo home run in Game 6 of the series. Maldonado was noted as a good home run hitter who did not usually hit for a high batting average, finishing at .254 for his MLB career. He played in eight different postseason series for three of his teams and won the World Series with the Blue Jays in . Recent career Maldonado provided color commentary for ESPN Deportes' coverage of the World Baseball Classic and regular season games. He was named general manager of the Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Baseball League. Maldonado contributed a video to \\"La Esquina de Candy\\" (or \\"Candy's Corner\\"). Also, in 2011, Maldonado was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame with former teammate and National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Roberto Alomar, Carlos Baerga and Luis \\"Mambo\\" DeLe√≥n for the 2011 Caribbean Series.

It is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is served by trains on the North Clyde Line. Dating from 1886, it was originally part of the Glasgow City and District Railway, the first underground railway in Scotland. The station was built using the cut and cover method, with the original walls being visible on the open air section at the western end of the platforms. Nearby points of interest include Sauchiehall Street and the Mitchell Library, and the station (along with nearby Anderston - a stop on the Argyle Line), serves the city's financial district, making this station popular with commuters. The original surface buildings of the station were removed in the late 1960s during the construction of the M8 motorway, and replaced by the current structure as part of the adjoining Elmbank Gardens commercial development in 1970 - the building was designed by the Richard Seifert Co-Partnership. In 1995 it received a minor refurbishment when lifts were provided down to platform level. The present station contains a staffed ticket office and a small branch of WHSmith. Automatic ticket gates have now been installed and came into operation on 3 June 2011.

XPDL defines an XML schema for specifying the declarative part of workflow / business process. XPDL is designed to exchange the process definition, both the graphics and the semantics of a workflow business process. XPDL is currently the best file format for exchange of BPMN diagrams; it has been designed specifically to store all aspects of a BPMN diagram. XPDL contains elements to hold graphical information, such as the X and Y position of the nodes, as well as executable aspects which would be used to run a process. This distinguishes XPDL from BPEL which focuses exclusively on the executable aspects of the process. BPEL does not contain elements to represent the graphical aspects of a process diagram. It is possible to say that XPDL is the XML Serialization of BPMN.  History  The Workflow Management Coalition, founded in August 1993, began by defining the Workflow Reference Model (ultimately published in 1995) that outlined the five key interfaces that a workflow management system must have. Interface 1 was for defining the business process, which includes two aspects: a process definition expression language and a programmatic interface to transfer the process definition to/from the workflow management system. The first revision of a process definition expression language was called Workflow Process Definition Language (WPDL) which was published in 1998. This process meta-model contained all the key concepts required to support workflow automation expressed using URL Encoding. Interoperability demonstrations were held to confirm the usefulness of this language as a way to communicate process models. By 1998, the first standards based on XML began to appear. The Workflow Management Coalition Working Group 1 produced an updated process definition expression language called XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) now known as XPDL 1.0. This second revision was an XML based interchange language that contained many of the same concepts as WPDL, with some improvements. XPDL 1.0 was ratified by the WfMC in 2002, and was subsequently implemented by more than two dozen workflow/BPM products to exchange process definitions. There was a large number of research projects and academic studies on workflow capabilities around XPDL, which was essentially the only standard language at the time for interchange of process design. The WfMC continued to update and improve the process definition interchange language. In 2004 the WfMC endorsed BPMN, a graphical formalism to standardize the way that process definitions were visualized. XPDL was extended specifically with the goal of representing in XML all the concepts present in a BPMN diagram. This third revision of a process definition expression language is known as XPDL 2.0 and was ratified by the WfMC in October 2005. In April 2008, the WfMC ratified XPDL 2.1 as the fourth revision of this specification. XPDL 2.1 includes extension to handle new BPMN 1.1 constructs, as well as clarification of conformance criteria for implementations. In spring 2012, the WfMC completed XPDL 2.2 as the fifth revision of this specification. XPDL 2.2 builds on version 2.1 by introducing support for the process modeling extensions added to BPMN 2.0.

Typically the number of players is 4. Gameplay Every player is dealt 4 cards from a 32 card deck. The cards are played one at a time face up in tricks. The first card played in a trick determines the suit for that trick. A player must follow suit to win. The goal is to win the last trick. The order of the cards is 10(high), 9, 8, 7, A, K, Q, J. All of the players excluding the winner of the fourth and final trick receives a point. A player may toep or increase the number of points at stake during a round at any time during play. Each toep increases the point value of the round by one. A toep is usually signified by a knock on the playing surface. Upon toeping the opposing players may either fold and receive the previous point total or risk receiving the new increased total by remaining in the round. Once a player reaches a certain number of points he or she is eliminated. The maximum number of points is typically 10 or 15, depending on the price of beverages. The winner of the round (so the winner of the last trick) has to deal in the next round and the player on the left of the dealer can start the first trick of the next round. The winner of a trick can start the next trick in the same round. A special action comes across when a player is one point short of the maximum and is in pelt (poverty). In order to protect this player, the player on pelt can always start the round, independent of the dealer. Thereby all other players have to decide whether they want to play the round for 2 points or leave (before one card is played) for 1 point. Deal and exchange Toepen is usually played as a drinking game, but can also be played with chips or directly with money. Each player receives four cards. The remainder of the pack is left face down in the middle of the table. Then any player whose hand consists entirely of As, Ks, Qs and Js may discard his hand face downward and deal himself/herself a new one. Indeed, any player may discard their hand in this way. However any exchange may be challenged by another player. If a player making an exchange is found to have 10, 9, 8 or 7 in their original hand, the discarder loses one life (but keeps the new hand), while if it was correct, the challenger loses one life. When a player has lost ten lives, he/she buys a round of drinks (or contributes to the drinks kitty or contributes an agreed number of chips to the pot), the score is wiped clean and the next rubber starts. A player who has already lost nine lives may not knock. Similarly, a player who has already lost eight lives may not make the second knock, one who has already lost seven lives may not make the third knock, and so on.Cf. A.H. Morehead & G. Mott- Smith (eds),Hoyle's Rules of Games, NAL Signet (2001). Additional rules for the drinking game Player to dealer's left leads first. Players must follow suit if possible, otherwise they may play any card. A trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner leads to the next trick. The winner of the fourth and last trick will deal the next hand. Each of the other players loses a life or lives. A player who holds three tens must whistle. A player who holds three jacks may whistle. A player who holds four tens must stand up. A player who holds four jacks may stand up. If a player is obliged to whistle but cannot, he must sing loudly.Cf. The Folio Book of Card Games, Folio Society, London (2009), pp.117-119. Example The score is maintained by peat. A normal game goes to a score of 10 or 15 points. These are penalty points. the one who wins the last move does not get any points. The other players receive a number of penalty points. Here is an example. Name: Points Thijs:  Tame:  Thomas:  Stan:  You can ‚Äútoep,‚Äù this means that more points are played. This example shows that Tame has often gone and often lost. Thijs has often won and has a low number of points. He has a great chance of winning. When he wins three times, he's a ‚ÄúToepkoning‚Äù. Thomas plays average and Stan is probably a ‚Äúlijntoeper‚Äù. This means that it only lasts when it is certain that it is winning. In this example, Tame insists on poverty. This means that when he gets another point, he's out of the game. Now the other players have to choose if they want to play. In the event that they last, two points are played.

Physical features The character of the landscape is \\"Low-Lying Agricultural\\", as indicated in the County Development Plan. This area contains mixed pasture and arable farming on low lands, consisting of large fields with few tree belts or large settlements. The village itself is situated in a shallow valley drained by a small river known locally as 'The Daws River' and is surrounded by lands zoned as agricultural in the 1999 Fingal County Development Plan. It is the policy of the council to protect and provide for the development of agriculture and rural amenity within this zone. History Oldtown is an example of a \\"chapel village\\" which led to a widespread investment in chapel building following the re-emergence of institutional Catholicism in the late eighteenth century. The original chapel, which was built in 1827, became the focal point of the village and attracted a range of other services such as the national school, community hall, priest's house, shop, public house and forge. The term \\"chapel villages\\" has been coined for settlements which evolved in association with the growing social and cultural importance of the Catholic Church in Irish society. Commemoration plaque on the bridge in Oldtown The Parliamentary Gazette of Ireland 1843‚Äì44 states that the population of Oldtown in 1841 was 156 and 27 houses were located within the village area of . After the Great Famine of 1848 the census of 1851 states the population of the village as recorded as 32 people. Molly Weston a heroine of the 1798 rebellion was born near Oldtown. She fought alongside her three brothers at Tara. A memorial was erected to her memory at Oldtown during the 1798 Bi-Centennial in 1998. \\"Arrayed in green... mounted on a white horse, [she] rode hither and thither upon the field with drawn sword in hand, rallying the pikemen and leading them in successive charges with the utmost fearlessness.\\" (Patrick Archer, Fingal in 1798). She wore a green riding costume, with gold braid in the manner of a uniform and a green cocked hat with a white plume. She was armed with sword and pistols and was accompanied by her four brothers when she rode into battle. Weston rallied and regrouped the stricken pikemen; she placed herself at their head and led repeated charges against the Reagh Fencibles. \\"She fired a big gun captured from the Fencibles during the course of the battle, killing eleven of their number. Molly died along with her four brothers at the Battle of Tara. Her side-saddle was recovered from the battlefield. Oldtown was the first town in the State to benefit from the \\"Rural Electrification Scheme\\", run by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) from 1946 to 1979. The first electricity pole was ceremoniously erected in November, 1946 at Kilsallaghan, and the first switch-on, was in Oldtown itself, in January 1947. The 50th anniversary of the event was commemorated in the village, with the ESB hosting a dinner, to which families living in the area since 1946, were invited. In the winter of 1981/1982 a large snowstorm cut off the village for five days, with the Air Corps eventually flying in supplies such as food and medicine via helicopter to relieve the village. Modern development The village core consists of a mix of two-storey nineteenth century stone built dwellings, single-storey cottages and bungalows. The new stone-built terraced dwellings within the core complement the scale and the vernacular architecture of the village. The recently redeveloped thatched cottage and Oldtown Local Hall, a corrugated community hall recently restored, add to the identity of the village ‚Äì however the small development of detached dormer bungalows located to the north of the village, contribute little to the streetscape and village character. The northern, western and southern approaches to the village are characterised mainly by low density 'one-off' dormers and bungalows with the exception of Shamrock Park, a small Council housing development to the south of the village. The Catholic Church, Our Lady Queen of Peace, and presbytery are located south of the village core. There is a significant level of undeveloped land within and close to the village core, which will serve to facilitate the augmentation and consolidation of the village. Facilities Commercial facilities in the village include a public house ‚Äì The Oldtown House ‚Äì and a veterinary surgery. Community facilities include the local primary school, the Catholic Church, the Oldtown Local Hall and a horse riding stable. The County Council's mobile library service visits the village on a weekly basis. The Oldtown Health and Care Centre is a Health Service Executive facility located to the south of the village which provides full-time care for disabled people and a community Health Centre where a variety of health and related services are provided. A Citizens Information Centre is also available here a few days each month. Oldtown has a large playing field, close to the centre of the village, which is home to the Wild Geese GAA club. First founded in 1888, it is said to be one of the oldest Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Dublin. The club won the Junior 'E' Dublin football championship in 2009, beating St. Brendans in the final. The club have underage teams, two adult men's team and a camogie team. The adult hurlers were Dublin Hurling League Division 8 (AHL8) winners in 2009. The field is also the location of an indoor handball alley, which is still in regular use. A number of former handball world champions are from the village. The alley is primarily used nowadays for racquetball.

The station then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. British Railways then ran the station for Strathclyde PTE, and continued to do so as ScotRail when sectorisation was introduced, until the privatisation of British Rail. The station became a terminus in January 1956, when passenger services to Bathgate over the former B&CR; were withdrawn - freight over this line continued until final closure & abandonment in 1982.

Nandalal Bose (3 December 1882 ‚Äì 16 April 1966) was one of the pioneers of modern Indian art and a key figure of Contextual Modernism. A pupil of Abanindranath Tagore, Bose was known for his \\"Indian style\\" of painting. He became the principal of Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan in 1922. He was influenced by the Tagore family and the murals of Ajanta; his classic works include paintings of scenes from Indian mythologies, women, and village life. Today, many critics consider his paintings among India's most important modern paintings. In 1976, the Archaeological Survey of India, Department of Culture, Govt. of India declared his works among the \\"nine artists\\" whose work, \\"not being antiquities\\", were to be henceforth considered \\"to be art treasures, having regard to their artistic and aesthetic value\\".Nine Masters Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh. \\"Nine Masters: Rabindranath Tagore, Amrita Sher-Gil, Jamini Roy, Nandalal Bose, Raja Ravi Varma, Gaganendranath Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, Sailoz Mookherjea, and Nicholas Roerich.\\" He was given the work of illustrating the constitution of India. Early life Nandalal Bose was born on 3 December 1882 in a middle-class Bengali family at Haveli Kharagpur, in Munger district of Bihar state. The family originally hailed from Jejur, Hooghly District of West Bengal.Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan by Anjali Bose, 1976, p. 236 His father, Purna Chandra Bose, was at that time working in the Darbhanga Estate. His mother Khetramoni Devi was a housewife with a skill in improvising toys and dolls for young Nandalal. From his early days Nandalal began taking an interest in modelling images and later, decorating Puja pandals. In 1898, at the age of fifteen, Nandalal moved to Calcutta for his high school studies in the Central Collegiate School. After clearing his examinations in 1902, he continued his college studies at the same institution. In June 1903 he married Sudhiradevi, the daughter of a family friend. Nanadalal wanted to study art, but he was not given permission by his family. Unable to qualify for promotion in his classes, Nandalal moved to other colleges, joining the Presidency College in 1905 to study commerce. After repeated failures, he persuaded his family to let him study art at Calcutta's School of Art. Career As a young artist, Nandalal Bose was deeply influenced by the murals of the Ajanta Caves. He had become part of an international circle of artists and writers seeking to revive classical Indian culture; a circle that already included Okakura Kakuz≈ç, William Rothenstein, Yokoyama Taikan, Christiana Herringham, Laurence Binyon, Abanindranath Tagore, and the seminal London Modernist sculptors Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein.Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, \\"The Transcultural Roots of Modernism: Imagist Poetry, Japanese Visual Culture, and the Western Museum System\\", Modernism/modernity Volume 18, Number 1, January 2011, 27‚Äì42. .Video of a Lecture mentioning Bose in the context of Indian influences n global modernism, London University School of Advanced Study, March 2012. To mark the 1930 occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's arrest for protesting the British tax on salt, Bose created a black on white linocut print of Gandhi walking with a staff. It became the iconic image for the non-violence movement. His genius and original style were recognised by famous artists and art critics like Gaganendranath Tagore, Ananda Coomaraswamy and O. C. Ganguli. These lovers of art felt that objective criticism was necessary for the development of painting and founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art. He became principal of the Kala Bhavana (College of Arts) at Tagore's International University Santiniketan in 1922. He was also famously asked by Jawaharlal Nehru to sketch the emblems for the Government of India's awards, including the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Shri. Along with his disciple Rammanohar, Nandalal Bose took up the historic task of beautifying/decorating the original manuscript of the Constitution of India. He died on 16 April 1966 in Calcutta. Today, the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi holds 7000 of his works in its collection, including a 1930 black and white linocut of the Dandi March depicting Mahatma Gandhi, and a set of seven posters he later made at the request of Mahatma Gandhi for the 1938 Haripura Session of the Indian National Congress.

Johnson, Jimmy Jean- Louis, Godfrey, and Joyful Drake. Plot Jazmin Biltmore is a smart-mouthed, frustrated, plus-sized, aspiring fashion designer and department store employee who is obsessed with her weight. Jazmin has always been overweight, (unlike her skinny cousin Mia), constantly battling with diets, weight loss aids, and even her own clothes. Because of her battle with finding trendy clothes that fit her full figure, despite working in a clothing department store, Jazmin creates and designs her own outfits. Even going as far as attempting to get a business loan to get her clothing line up and running. During a bout of depression, Jazmin is contacted from one of her diet plan agencies and told she won a trip for 3 to Palm Springs for the weekend at a five-star resort. She and best friend Stacey find the first day at the spa embarrassing, as hotel robes don't fit, the massage tables too small for their thick figures, and uninviting attitudes from other hotel guests. They leave in frustration to join Mia, who has been ogling a Nigerian man swimming in the pool. Despite Mia's obvious flirting, he expresses interest in Jazmin. He introduces himself as Dr. Tunde, but Jazmin is tongue tied, too distracted by his good looks to remember her own name. He and his friends find Jazmin and Stacey beautiful. However, they think Mia is too skinny and wonder if she is sick. They invite the women to a Nigerian party, Tunde, speaking Nigerian with his friends Dr. Akibo and Dr. Godwin, tells them he has never seen such beautiful full figured women in America. Upon their night out, Tunde expresses even more interest with her outspoken behaviour and strong opinions. Akibo shows his desire for Stacey and she reciprocates, fighting her shy nature. Meanwhile Godwin attempts to flirt with other full figured guests, ignoring Mia. Even going as far as to tell a woman she was a patient, explaining why she is so thin. Akibo and Stacey go on to have days packed with vigorous sex and Mia leaves the party early to go back to the hotel and wallow in self pity over not finding an attractive Dr. Like Stacey and Jazmin. Tunde and Jazmin begin dating with Jazmin constantly questioning his attraction to her, to herself and to Tunde. Going as far as to ask him if he is truly interested in her, why hasn't he tried to sleep with her? Tunde tells Jazmin he was trying to be respectful but will gladly sleep with her the next day, due to work obligations but before they consummate their relationship she grows jealous and makes a scene when she sees him having dinner with a beautiful, thin, white woman instead of having dinner with a colleague like he told her. Tunde reveals the woman was his colleague, but Jazmin, realizing she is too insecure to be comfortable in a relationship with Tunde, breaks up with him and leaves Palm Springs, along with Stacey and Mia. At home, she is depressed, ignoring phone calls, comforting herself with food and television before having a breakthrough and realizing she is beautiful and worthy of being loved. Bursting with new confidence, Jazmin approaches the head buyer of the Bloomfields where she works and shows him her designs. Impressed he helps develop Jazmin's fashion line \\"Thick Madame\\" becomes popular and is launched worldwide. One year later, she travels to Nigeria to apologize to the man she realizes she loves. A woman opens the door holding a baby. Jazmin asks if she is Tunde's wife, and the woman agrees. Jazmin has the girls go to the taxi because she did not wish to be rejected with an audience. She tells Tunde that he has changed her life, and she is sorry she could not accept his love when she had the chance. Explaining she could not accept love from someone when she did not love herself and though she still cares for him she is not a \\"homewrecker\\" and will not pursue him. Tunde clarifies that the woman is a maid, he delivered the baby, and the maid doesn't understand English. He says his prayers have been answered, as he has loved Jazmin all along and they share a passionate kiss. Stacey also reunites with their partner, and they join Tunde's family for dinner. Mia piles food on her plate, stating that she wants to bulk up so she can find a rich Nigerian doctor as well. The film ends with Jazmin and Tunde in bed, while Jazmin insists on having the lights on to see every sexy thing on Tunde's body, with the credits ending.

It is located near the Palm Springs International Airport. Box office Though critically panned, the film is considered to be a financial success because it recouped its $3 million production budget from theatrical and rental revenues, totaling over $18.6 million. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $3,109,924 in the United States. The film has grossed a total of $7,061,128 in theaters in the United States. It also made $340,762 overseas, thus totaling $7,401,890 in theaters worldwide. It also made an additional $11,250,000 on DVD and home video rentals in 2006. Critical reception The film received mostly negative reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting that out of 43 reviews, 10 were \\"Fresh\\" and 33 \\"Rotten\\", making for an overall 23% approval rating and the consensus: \\"Although Phat Girlz has good intentions, it is sloppily made and thin on laughs.\\" The film has a slightly higher score of 36/100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews. The San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying \\"Clumsily directed yet entertainingly written by Oakland native Nnegest Likk√©, Phat Girlz is like Rocky with cellulite. Or maybe Pretty Woman without all the bony butts. It has a lot of heart and soul, but it's almost never mean- spirited.\\" Variety magazine's Joe Leydon said that the film \\"feels torturously padded at an overlong 98 minutes\\", and also claims that the romance between Jazmin (Mo'Nique) and Tunde (Jean-Louis) is too drawn out, \\"quite possibly because writer-director Nnegest Likke has nothing else in her scenario to sustain audience interest\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D grade, remarking that \\"Mo'Nique is fat. Almost every scene in Phat Girlz ‚Äî the fancy z is for Z-grade ‚Äî is about how she's fat\\", and concluding that \\"the movie reduces her to a single discernible characteristic, which is a telltale mark of many a wholly awful comedy.\\" References External links  Category:2006 films Category:2006 comedy films Category:2006 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:Body image in popular culture Category:English-language films Category:Films set in California Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"Phat Girlz"},{"id":"4261394","text":"Jabin ( YƒÅ·∏á√Æn) is a Biblical name meaning 'discerner', or 'the wise'. It may refer to: * A king of Hazor at the time of the entrance of Israel into Canaan (Joshua 11:1 - 14), whose overthrow and that of the northern chiefs with whom he had entered into a confederacy against Joshua was the crowning act in the conquest of the land (Joshua 11:21 - 23; comp 14:6 - 15). The Battle of the Waters of Merom, fought at Lake Hula, was the last of Joshua's battles of which we have any record. Here for the first time the Israelites encountered the iron chariots and horses of the Canaanites. The Israelites killed him and everyone in his city along with all the people in the cities of Madon, Shimron, Achshaph, Debir, and Anab. They then destroyed Hazor by fire. According to Norman Gottwald, Joshua had nothing to do with the incident, which probably reflects a tradition of the late 13th century BCE destruction of Hazor by part of a group later identified with the Israelite tribe of Naphtali.Norman K. Gottwald, The Tribes of Yahweh, Continuum, 1999 p.154. * Another king of Hazor, called \\"the king of Canaan,\\" who overpowered the Israelites of the north one hundred and sixty years after Joshua's death, and for twenty years held them in painful subjection. The whole population were paralyzed with fear, and gave way to hopeless despondency (Judges 5:6 - 11), until Deborah and Barak aroused the national spirit, and gathering together ten thousand men, gained a great and decisive victory over Jabin in the plain of Esdraelon (Judges 4:10 - 16; compare Psalms 83:9). This was the first great victory Israel had gained since the days of Joshua. For the next forty years, they never needed to fight another battle with the Canaanites (Judges 5:31).

Studying cell migration is important from the point of view of metastasis, and for this reason, several model organisms are used to determine what molecules are important in initiating, maintaining and guiding moving cells. Drosophila melanogaster is one of the favorite organisms for studying biological phenomena. The border cells of the Drosophila ovary are a genetically tractable system for studying diverse aspects of moving phenotype. After identifying the genes that are important for this phenotype, their homologs can be investigated for putative roles in turning non-invasive cancerous tumors into metastatic ones. The egg chamber of the Drosophila ovary contains 16 central germline cells surrounded by a monolayer epithelium of about 1000 follicle cells. At stage 9 of Drosophila oogenesis, these cells perform a stereotypical invasive migration on the intervening nurse cells, and reach the oocyte. The migration consists of an initial posterior migration, followed by another in the dorsal direction. It is now known that the transcription factor Slbo (slow border cells) is a master regulator of the migratory phenotype. The migratory cluster is initiated by JAK-STAT pathway and is guided by the growth of long cellular extensions. The directional cues are provided by receptor tyrosine kinases. Cells that undergo such a change in fate as migratory border cells have two distinct alternatives: reorganize the existing proteins or bring about massive changes in gene expression. In our case, the latter case seems to hold true. The transcription factor slbo which commandeers the transcription of several genes is believed to be central to this phenomenon. slbo was identified in a P-element screen for female sterility several years ago ‚Äì and since then several proteins downstream of it have come up. The slbo locus encodes the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) ‚Äì a basic region-leucine zipper transcription factor, and it was thus expected that one or more of its targets would be essential in migration. Importance This migration of the border cells appears to be important for two reasons ‚Äì the formation of a structure called a micropyle, which is important for sperm entry, and for expressing the torso-like gene, which is an anterior-posterior patterning signal. Laser ablation of the border cells or their failure to migrate lead to improper morphogenesis of the micropyle. References *Ambra Bianco, Minna Poukkula, Adam Cliffe, Juliette Mathieu, Carlos M.

With these weapons it conducted an armed campaign against the British state in Northern Ireland.War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History Volume 2 by Robert B. Asprey (), page 1125Global Geopolitics: A Critical Introduction by Klaus Dodds (), page 205British Civilization by John Oakland (), page 108 American arms In the early stages of the Troubles, during the period 1969‚Äì1972, the Provisional IRA was poorly armed. They had access to weapons remaining from the IRA's failed Border Campaign between 1956 and 1962, but these weapons were outdated and unsuitable for a modern campaign. After 1969, and the split with the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA gained control of a majority of the stockpiled weaponry still held from previous IRA campaigns. They found that the stockpiles consisted mostly of pre-World War II small arms ranging from Lee‚ÄìEnfield and M1 Garand and M1 carbine rifles, to MP40 and Thompson submachine guns (SMG), plus Bren light machine guns (LMG) and Webley revolvers.Taylor, p. 62. The Garands were used in IRA operations as late as the summer of 1976, when a British army patrol in South Armagh was fired on by one of these rifles loaded with armour-piercing ammunition.Bramley, Vincent (2012). Two Sides of Hell. John Blake, p. 57. To continue and escalate their armed campaign, the IRA needed to be better equipped, which meant securing modern small arms. In previous campaigns weapons had been secured before hostilities commenced via raids on British Army and even Irish Army weapons depots. In the 1969‚Äì1971 period this was no longer feasible.Previous raids included the 1940 Christmas Raid, the 1953 Felstead Raid, and the 1955 Hazebrouck Raid. By 1972, the IRA had large quantities of modern small arms, particularly Armalite rifles, manufactured and purchased in the United States. The AR-18 rifle in particular was found to be very well suited for guerrilla warfare as its small size and folding stock meant that it was easy to conceal. Moreover, it was capable of rapid fire and fired a high velocity round which provided great \\"stopping power\\".Taylor, pp. 108‚Äì109. The IRA's main gunrunner in the United States was George Harrison, an IRA veteran, resident in New York since 1938. Harrison bought guns for the IRA from a Corsican arms dealer named George de Meo, who had connections in organised crime. Joe Cahill acted as the contact between NORAID and Harrison. In 1971, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had already seized 700 modern weapons from the IRA, including two tonnes of high explosive and 157,000 rounds of ammunition, most of which were of American manufacture. The Armalite AR-18 ‚Äì obtained by the IRA from the United States in the early 1970s and an emotive symbol of its armed campaign Harrison spent an estimated US$1 million in the 1970s purchasing over 2,500 guns for the IRA. According to Brendan Hughes, a key figure in the Belfast Brigade, the IRA smuggled small arms from the United States by sea on 'Queen Elizabeth 2' from New York via Southampton, through Irish members of her crew, until the network was cracked down on by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the 1980s.Geraghty, Tony (2000). The Irish War. Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 172. These Queen Elizabeth 2 shipments included Armalite rifles, and were driven from Southampton to Belfast in small consignments. The M60 GPMG obtained by the IRA in 1977 from the US In the late 1970s, another IRA member, Gabriel Megahey, was sent to the United States to acquire more arms and he was able to procure more Armalite AR-15 rifles, plus a number of Heckler & Koch rifles and other weapons. Again, the purchase of these weapons was funded by Irish American republicans.Taylor, pp. 1‚Äì5. A batch of M60 machine guns was imported in 1977.Martin Dillon, The Dirty War: Covert Strategies and Tactics Used in Political Conflicts Taylor & Francis, 1999 , p. 400 Harrison was arrested by the FBI in 1981, but acquitted at his trial. Megahey was arrested by the FBI in 1982 after a successful sting operation, where he was trying to purchase surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) for the IRA, and sentenced to seven years in prison. In 1984, the FBI warned the Republic of Ireland that a major IRA arms shipment was underway from the United States, and that the weaponry would be transferred to an Irish fishing trawler in the Atlantic. Subsequently, Irish authorities discovered that the arms ship was a vessel named Marita Ann, allegedly after a tip off from Sean O'Callaghan, a Garda S√≠och√°na intelligence agent within the IRA. Three Irish Naval Service ships confronted the vessel off the coast of County Kerry, and prevented its escape by firing warning shots. A team of naval personnel and Garda officers boarded the ship, arresting the crew of five and confiscating seven tons of military equipment, as well as medications, training manuals, and communications equipment.\\"Scannal: Boston\\" RT√â Television The weapons had been donated by the South Boston Winter Hill Irish Mob. Libyan arms The other source of IRA arms in the 1970s was the leader of the Libyan Arab Republic, Muammar Gaddafi, who was engaging in a strategy at this time of opposing United States interests in the Middle East by sponsoring paramilitary activity against it and its allies in Western Europe. The first Libyan arms shipment to the IRA took place in 1972‚Äì1973, following visits by Joe Cahill to Libya. In early 1973, the Irish Government received intelligence that the vessel Claudia was carrying a consignment of weapons, and placed the ship under surveillance on 27 March. On 28 March, three Irish Navy patrol vessels intercepted the Claudia in Irish territorial waters near Helvick Head, County Waterford, seizing five tonnes of Libyan small arms and ammunition found on board. The weaponry seized included 250 Soviet-made small arms, 240 rifles, anti-tank mines and other explosives. Cahill himself was also found and arrested on board the vessel.RT√â Documentary: The NavyBowyer Bell, p. 398. It is estimated that three other shipments of weaponry of a similar size and nature succeeded in getting through to the IRA in the same time period.Taylor, p. 156 Journalist Ed Moloney reports that the early Libyan arms shipments provided the IRA with its first RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and that Gaddafi also gave three to five million U.S. dollars at this time to the organisation to finance its activities.Moloney, p. 10. However contact with the Libyan government was broken off in 1976. Contact with Libya was opened again in the aftermath of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which was said to have impressed Gaddafi. In the 1980s, the IRA received further larger quantities of weaponry and explosives from the Libyan Government, reportedly enough to equip least two professional infantry battalions.A court action is currently (May 2006) underway against Libya by victims of IRA violence. See here. Four shipments of guns, ammunition and explosives were made between 1985 and 1986, providing large quantities of modern weaponry to the IRA, including heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles, and Semtex explosiveHarnden, Toby (1999). Bandit Country ‚Äì The IRA and South Armagh.

From late 1986 onwards, virtually every bomb constructed by the Provisional IRA, and splinter groups such as the Real IRA, contained Semtex from a Libyan shipment unloaded at an Irish pier in 1986. These shipments were partly in retaliation for the British Government's support for the US Air Force's (USAF) bombing attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986, which in turn were in retaliation for the 1986 bombing of the La Belle discotheque in Berlin. The USAF planes involved in the bombings had taken off from British bases on 14 April 1986, and Libya reportedly suffered 60 casualties in the attack. This second major Libyan contribution to the IRA came in 1986‚Äì1987. There were four shipments which were not intercepted, in a huge intelligence failure of both Irish and British agencies described as 'calamitous' by journalist Brendan O'Brien.O'Brien, p. 137 The arm supplies from Libya developed as follows: * The trawler Casamara took on ten tonnes of weapons in September 1985 off the Maltese island of Gozo. These weapons were landed off the Clogga Strand near Arklow by inflatable boats some weeks later. The shipment contained five hundred crates of AK-47s, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition and seven RPG-7s. * Casamara (renamed Kula at this time), left Maltese waters on 6 October 1985 carrying a cache of DShK heavy machine guns. * In July 1986, there was a shipment of 14 tonnes, including, according to the authorities, two SAM-7s. * In October 1986, another shipment of 80 tonnes which included one tonne of Semtex, reportedly ten SAM-7 missiles, more RPG-7s, AK-47s and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition arrived aboard the oil-rig replenishment Villa.Bowyer Bell, p. 570. In total, the arms shipments included: 275pxthumbrightAn AK-47 assault rifle (over 1000 of which were donated by Gaddafi to the IRA in the 1980s) RPG-7 * 9mm Browning, Taurus, Glock and Beretta handguns * AK-47 Kalashnikov and AKM assault rifles * MP5 submachine guns * RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launcher * Soviet made DShK heavy machine guns * FN MAG machine guns * Military flamethrowers * Semtex plastic explosive * Strela 2 man portable SAMs It is also estimated that the Libyan government gave the IRA the equivalent of ¬£2 million along with the 1980s shipments. However, on 1 November 1987, during transit to Ireland, one-third of the total Libyan arms consignment being carried aboard the MV Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy while the ship was in the Bay of Biscay,Martin Dillon, The Dirty War: Covert Strategies and Tactics Used in Political Conflicts Taylor & Francis, 1999 , p. 441 along with five crew members, among them Gabriel Cleary. The vessel was found to contain 120 tonnes of weapons, including HMGs, 36 RPGs, 1000 detonators, 20 SAMs, Semtex and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Ed Moloney claimed that the Eksund shipment also contained military mortars and a 106-millimetre cannon, an assertion never confirmed by the Irish authorities.Moloney, p. 22. Despite the seizure of the Eksund arms, the IRA was by then equipped with a quantity and quality of weaponry and explosives never available to them at any other phase of their history. Furthermore, according to Brendan O'Brien there was actually an 'over-supply', especially regarding the 600 AK-47s still in the hands of the IRA by 1992.O'Brien, p. 239 The Garda S√≠och√°na (the Police Service of the Republic of Ireland) uncovered numerous arms destined for the IRA in 1988. These included several hundred AK-47s, Russian DSHK HMGs, FN MAG machine guns and Semtex.O'Brien, p. 143. By 1996, Jane's Intelligence Review reported that \\"it is believed that the bulk of the material presently in IRA arsenals was shipped from Libya in the mid-1980s with the aid of a skipper, Adrian Hopkins, hired for the purpose by the IRA.\\" Compensation claims On 31 October 2009, a cross-party delegation of Northern Irish politicians travelled to the Libyan capital Tripoli for the first face to face meeting with Libyan government ministers to discuss compensation claims for victims of IRA violence. Other arms sources FN FNC Vz. 58 As well as these major sources of arms, the IRA also bought weapons on a smaller scale from various arms dealers in continental Europe. In the 1970s, some guns were purchased by D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill in Czechoslovakia and in the 1980s, Belgian FN FNC rifles were obtained, probably smuggled through the Netherlands. There was contact between the IRA and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and specifically the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), starting from the mid-1970s which included the training of IRA volunteers.The IRA ‚Äì 6th Edition ‚Äì Tim Pat Coogan ‚Äì p. 436 At one stage, the PLO offered weapons and training to the IRA, but they declined on the grounds that it was impossible to smuggle arms out of the Levant region in general and Palestine specifically without alerting Israeli intelligence. Tim Pat Coogan wrote that assistance from the PLO largely dried up in the mid-1980s after the PLO had forged stronger links with the government of the Republic of Ireland.The IRA ‚Äì 6th Edition ‚Äì Tim Pat Coogan ‚Äì p. 489 AG-3 rifles from Norway were also secretly obtained. Last arms deals In the 1990s, the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade smuggled in a number of Barrett M82 and Barrett M90 .50 BMG rifles from the United States.O'Brien, pp. 354‚Äì355. These weapons were used by two South Armagh sniper teams to conduct a sniping campaign against British Army patrols operating in the area. The last British soldier killed in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, Stephen Restorick, was shot dead by a sniper in South Armagh in February 1997. Soon after, in April 1997, the leader of one of the sniper squads, Michael Caraher, and other IRA volunteers were arrested and a Barrett rifle recovered. Despite their ceasefires of 1994 and 1997 the IRA continued to buy arms. They needed a new source of weapons, since the Libyan pipeline had been closed. In May 1996, the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia's internal security service, publicly accused Estonia of arms smuggling, and claimed that the IRA had contacted representatives of Estonia's volunteer defence force, Kaitseliit, and some non-government groups to buy weapons. However the Russian report did not say when the contacts had taken place. In July 1999, three men, Anthony Smyth, Conor Claxton, and Martin Mullan, along with an accomplice, Siobhan Browne, were arrested by the American FBI and ATF agencies and accused of buying 44 handguns from arms dealers in Florida in the United States and posting 15 of the weapons to Ireland and the United Kingdom. Later estimates put the number of guns sent to Ireland at more than 100 pistols and machine pistols. All three men were cleared of conspiracy to aid terrorists and to commit murder. They were later sentenced on the less serious smuggling charge. The IRA leadership denied knowledge of the arms buys. Timeline: The IRA's importation of weapons *In 1969 the IRA received its first cache of weapons from supporters in the United States, with 70 small arms comprising M1 carbines, M3 \\"grease gun\\" submachine guns, some handguns, and 60,000 rounds of ammunition. *In 1970, the IRA receives weapons from Basque ETA. This includes around 50 revolvers. *In 1971, the IRA receives its first consignments of Armalite rifles. They include around 100 AR-15 and AR-180 rifles, on the Queen Elizabeth 2 (New York to Southampton). *Later that year Garda√≠ recover six suitcases full of 5.56√ó45mm ammunition at Dublin Port arriving on a ship from the US. *Again in 1971, IRA leader D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill arranges for weapons to be bought off Czechoslovakian arms company Omnipol in Prague. The arms are seized at Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands. *In 1972 Colonel Gaddafi sends his first arms shipments to Ireland, a small shipment of around ten weapons and some explosives. *Once again in 1972, the IRA buy RPG-7 rocket launchers from unknown sources in Europe. *The IRA receives another batch of M16 and AR-15 rifles from supporters in the US. *In 1973 the IRA receives another consignment of arms from Libya but the arms are intercepted on board the Claudia by members of the Garda√≠. Leading IRA man Joe Cahill and others arrested. The shipment consisted of 250 AK-47 rifles and other materiel. *In 1974, the FBI foil an IRA attempt to buy 100 M16 rifles. *In 1977 the PLO (Al-Fatah) sends arms to the IRA. They are intercepted at Antwerp. An IRA man is arrested by Garda√≠. The arms are believed to have come from Lebanon. * Between 1977 and 1978, M60 machineguns, M16 assault rifles and C-100s are stolen from a US Army base and shipped to Ireland. * Between 1973 and 1978, 500,000 rounds of 5.56√ó45mm NATO ammunition stolen from a US Marine base are successfully sent to the IRA. * 1979 The Garda√≠ seize a cargo of more than 150 guns and 60,000 rounds of ammunition. including two M-60s, 15 M-16s, a number of M14s, and an AK-47 sent from the US. * 1981, the FBI set up a sting capturing some of the Harrison arms trafficking network that was believed to be smuggling most of the arms for the IRA. The group had ordered 350 MAC-10 SMGs and 12 AK-47 rifles. * In 1982 US customs discover a truck at the docks of Newark, New Jersey. Four members of an IRA cell are arrested. The shipment contained 50 firearms and frequency switches for detonating bombs, to counter British Army jamming of most IRA signals for detonating bombs. * Later that year five men are arrested for entering the US from Canada, suspected of a plot to acquire ammunition for the IRA, with a \\"shopping list\\" for 200 cases of ammunition discovered by police. * In 1983 the FBI foils an IRA attempt to buy explosives. * In 1984 An IRA arms shipment is seized on the fishing boat Marita Ann by the Irish Navy. Men jailed in the US and Ireland. Seven tons of arms, ammunition and explosives procured by the Irish Mob in Boston. * In 1985 The FBI foils another IRA bid to buy small arms in Colorado. An Irishman is deported. * In 1986, 40 firearms, including: 13 FN FAL rifles, an AK-47, two hand grenades, drums of nitrobenzene, 70,000 rounds of ammunition are seized in the Netherlands by Dutch police. IRA members Gerry Kelly and Brendan McFarlane were arrested. * Irish police seize ten AG-3 rifles in 1986, part of a batch of 100 stolen from a Norwegian Reserve base near Oslo by a criminal gang and sold to the IRA. * The IRA attempt to buy Redeye SAMs, M60 MGs, M16 rifles, MP5 SMGs and 11 bullet-proof vests, but are caught in an FBI sting operation. * Between 1985‚Äì87 four shipments of arms and explosives successfully landed in Ireland by boat skipper Adrian Hopkins, totalling around 150 tons. The fifth, on Eksund, is intercepted by French Customs. Libya had sent a total of 300 tons of weaponry including 150 tons of Romanian AKMs, SA-7s, Semtex-H, RPG-7 rocket launchers, Taurus pistols, and other materiel. * In 1988 a total 380 gallons of nitrobenzene from the Netherlands are seized by Garda√≠ in a truck. * US Customs foil bid to buy rifles from a gun dealer in Alabama. Two men who attempted to buy high-powered rifles are jailed. * Detonators for bombs and parts for an anti-aircraft missile system are seized, and a number of IRA members and a NASA scientist are arrested by FBI after a long covert spying operation that began in 1982. A group of IRA supporters are jailed in Boston in 1990 for trying to smuggle a home-made missile system to Ireland. * 1988‚Äì90 FBI foils plot to acquire FIM-92 Stinger missiles on black market in Miami. Several arrests are made. * Late 1980s and early 1990s: The IRA manage to obtain half a dozen Barrett rifles and other .50 cal sniper rifles, all destined for the South Armagh Sniper teams. Decommissioning of arms Following the announcement of their cessation of violence and commitment to exclusively peaceful means, the Provisional IRA decommissioned its arms in July‚ÄìSeptember 2005. Among the weaponry estimated, (by Jane's Information Group), to have been destroyed as part of this process were: * 1,000 rifles * 2 tonnes of Semtex * 20‚Äì30 heavy machine guns * 7 surface-to-air missiles * 7 flame throwers * 1,200 detonators * 11 rocket-propelled grenade launchers * 90 handguns * 100+ grenades The panel overseeing the decommissioning of IRA weaponry and weapons stockpiles, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) headed by General de Chastelain oversaw the decommissioning process. The decommissioning process has taken place using estimates of IRA weaponry submitted by the British and Irish Governments.Colonel Gaddafi is known to have given the British Government a detailed inventory of weapons he gave to the IRA in the 1970s and 1980s, this list was handed to British intelligence in 1995. See Bowyer Bell Page 578 de Chastelain said he had seen rifles, particularly AK-47s, machine guns, ground- to-air missiles, explosives, explosive material, mortars, flame throwers, handguns, timer units and ballistic caps, and some weaponry that was \\"very old\\", including a Bren machine gun. The IICD's final report was issued on 26 September 2005 and the panel stated to the press:The IICD PDF report is available here. > We have observed and verified events to put beyond use very large quantities > of arms which we believe include all the arms in the IRA's possession‚Ä¶ Our > new inventory is consistent with these estimates. We are satisfied that the > arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA's arsenal. and while they could not report on the quantity or types of weapons destroyed they said: > The experience of seeing this with our own eyes, on a minute-to-minute > basis, provided us with evidence so clear and of its nature so > incontrovertible that at the end of the process [IRA weapon decommissioning] > it demonstrated to us ‚Äì and would have demonstrated to anyone who might have > been with us ‚Äì that beyond any shadow of doubt, the arms of the IRA have now > been decommissioned. Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern also stated at the time: > The weapons of the IRA are gone, and are gone in a manner which has been > verified and witnessed. However, despite the conclusion of the IICD agreeing with the figures provided by the British security forces, unnamed sources in MI5 and the PSNI have reported to the press that not all IRA arms were destroyed during the process, a claim which so far remains unsubstantiated. These reports have since been scotched by the group overseeing the activities of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland ‚Äì the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). In its latest report, dated April 2006, the IMC points out that it has no reason to disbelieve the IRA or information to suspect that the group has not fully decommissioned. Rather, it indicated that any weaponry that had not been handed in had been retained by individuals outside the IRA's control. Excerpt from the IMC's 10th report: > Indeed, our present assessment is that such of the arms as were reported to > us as having been retained, would have been withheld under local control > despite the instructions of the leadership. We note that, as reported by the > Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the > leadership claimed only to have decommissioned all the arms \\"under its > control\\". The relevant points are that the amount of un-surrendered material > was not significant in comparison to what was decommissioned and that these > reports do not cast doubt on the declared intention of the IRA leadership to > eschew terrorism and to follow the political path. We will continue to > monitor the position.10th Report of the IMC Page 15 April 2006, available > here .

Pollokshields East railway station is one of three railway stations serving Pollokshields in Glasgow, Scotland. The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and lies on the Cathcart Circle Line.  History  The station opened concurrently with the Cathcart District Railway, on 1 March 1886 and was the first of two stations on the Cathcart Circle serving the area to be built (nearby opened eight years later on the western side of the Circle). It was closed as a wartime economy measure during World War 1 between January 1917 and June 1919. The 1923 Grouping saw ownership pass to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and then onto the Scottish Region of British Railways in January 1948. Many trains over the route began to be worked by diesel multiple units from the summer of 1958, with overhead electrification following in 1962. A line voltage of 6.25 kV A.C was used south of there initially due to clearance issues with the bridges & cuttings along the route, though this was subsequently increased to the standard 25 kV in the early 1970s. The original station building was badly damaged by fire in April 1976\\"Chronology - Cathcart District Railway\\"Railscot; Retrieved 1 September 2016 and was subsequently rebuilt in contemporary style by British Rail.  Services   2016  A typical weekday and Saturday service is five trains per hour to (one train per hour in each direction on the Cathcart Circle, two from and one from Newton via Kirkhill), two trains per hour to Neilston and one train per hour to Newton (the one other hourly train to/from Newton runs via ). A Sunday service is almost the same except the Cathcart Circle trains do not operate. As a result, only three trains per hour operate to Glasgow Central.

He was born in Paris to a French-Romanian mother and a British-Lithuanian father. He lived in Paris until age 7, then in Belgium until age 11; when World War II began, the family moved to England. He emigrated to the United States in 1970 and taught at several American universities, primarily Rutgers, where he was a professor from 1972 until 1985. He has lived outside Santa Fe, New Mexico since his retirement from Rutgers. Education Tarn was educated at Lyc√©e d'Anvers and Clifton College and graduated with degrees in history and English from King's College, Cambridge. He returned to Paris and, after some journalism and radio work, discovered anthropology at the Mus√©e de l'Homme, the Ecole des Hautes Etudes and the Coll√®ge de France. A Smith-Mundt-Fulbright grant took him to the University of Chicago; he did fieldwork for his doctorate in anthropology with the Highlands Maya of Guatemala. Career In 1958, a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation administered by the Royal Institute of International Affairs sent him to Burma for 18 months, after which he became an instructor at London School of Economics and then lecturer in Southeast Asian Anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London. Even after moving primarily to literature, he continued to write and publish anthropological work on the Highland Maya and on the sociology of Buddhist institutions, as E. Michael Mendelson. Tarn published his first volume of poetry Old Savage/Young City with Jonathan Cape in 1964 and a translation of Pablo Neruda's The Heights of Macchu Picchu in 1966 (broadcast by the BBC Third Programme 1966), and began building a new poetry program at Cape. He left anthropology in 1967. From 1967-9, he joined Cape as General Editor of the international series Cape Editions and as a Founding Director of the Cape-Goliard Press, specializing in contemporary American Poetry with emphasis on Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Louis Zukofsky and their peers and successors. In 1970, with a principal interest in the American literary scene, he immigrated to the United States as Visiting Professor of Romance Languages, Princeton University, and eventually became a citizen. Later he moved to Rutgers. Since then he has taught English and American Literature, Epic Poetry, Folklore and other subjects at the Universities of Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New Mexico. As poet, literary & cultural critic (Views from the Weaving Mountain, University of New Mexico Press, 1991, and \\"The Embattled Lyric, Stanford University Press, 2007), translator (he was the first to render Victor Segalen's \\"St√®les\\" into English, continued work on Neruda, Latin American and French poets) and editor (with many magazines), Tarn has published some thirty books and booklets in his various disciplines. He has been translated into ten foreign languages. In 1985, he took early retirement as Professor Emeritus of Poetry, Comparative Literature & Anthropology from Rutgers University and has since lived near Santa Fe, New Mexico. His interests range from bird watching, gardening, classical music, opera & ballet, and much varied collecting, to aviation and world history. Among many recognitions, Tarn has received the Guiness prize for his first book, a Pennsylvania State literary prize for teaching poetry in the schools, was a finalist in the Phi Beta Kappa poetry awards for ‚ÄúSelected Poems 1950-2000.‚Äù His work has been supported by the Fulbright Program, the Wenner Gren Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, the American Philosophical Society, and a number of other Foundations.

Early Life Irving was born in Godalming, Surrey, and from the age of seven sang in the choir at Godalming Parish Church. He attended Charterhouse School.Lamb, Andrew. 'Irving, (Kelville) Ernest' in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) Other than that he was self-taught, and began his career applying for music director jobs advertised in The Stage. His first professional job conducting an orchestra was for the musical burlesque Villiano the Vicious at the Theatre Royal, Maidenhead in 1895. He then spent the next two decades learning his trade by touring with productions (of variable quality) all around the UK - in his own words conducting \\"third rate opera and second-rate musical comedy\\".Obituary, The Times, 26 October 1953, p 10 The tours included some organised by the theatre manager George Edwardes. In 1907 he worked with Edward German to reduce the orchestral scoring for the opera Tom Jones down to 15 players for touring purposes. German liked his work, and asked him to do the same again the following year for Merrie England. His big break came in 1917 when he met Norman O'Neill at the Savage Club. At the time O'Neill was music director of the Haymarket Theatre and treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society. Irving became involved with both, deputising for O'Neill and conducting on tours of his productions, including the popular Mary Rose in 1920.Irving, Ernest. Cue for Music (1959) He was a great admirer of O'Neill's work, and once compared a performance of Mary Rose without his music to \\"a dance by a fairy with a wooden leg.\\"Hudson, Derek. Letter to The Listener, 9 April, 1959, p 639 London Theatre From the end of the First World War until the late 1940s, Irving became a permanent fixture of the London theatre scene, conducting, directing and often composing the music for operettas, musical plays and serious drama at most of the London theatres. A notable early success was the British version of Lilac Time, with music by Schubert adapted by George H. Clutsam, which opened at the Lyric Theatre on December 22, 1922 and ran for 626 performances. The following year he conducted Polly (sequel to The Beggar's Opera) with music restored by Frederic Austin. This began a lasting friendship between Irving and Austin. In 1928 he was contracted by Charles Cochran to direct the music for This Year of Grace by Noel Coward, which ran for ten months at the London Pavilion. Another Cochran production followed, Cole Porter's Wake Up and Dream, which ran for 263 performances at the same theatre. He conducted The Immortal Hour for Sir Barry Jackson in 1933 at the Queen's Theatre. The score Irving provided for The Two Bouquets (1936), a comedy by Herbert Farjeon, was based on Victorian melodies selected by Eleanor Farjeon.Radio Times, Issue 870, 2 June 1940, p 16 There were two more collaborations with the Farjeons: An Elephant in Arcady (1939)Radio Times, 25 November 1938, p 15, and The Glass Slipper (1944), the latter with music for the dance interludes by Clifton Parker.Ballet Rambert performance archive Johnson Over Jordan was originally produced in 1939 with Ralph Richardson as Robert Johnson. It had an original score by the young Benjamin Britten.\\"Benjamin Britten (1913-1976)‚Äì Paul Bunyan Overture, Piano Concerto, Johnson Over Jordan (Suite)\\", Naxos Records, accessed 12 January 2014 Irving conducted two Mozart operas (The Marriage of Figaro and Cos√¨ fan tutte) at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre in 1938 with the Chanticleer Opera Company.'Opera in the Rain', Manchester Guardian, 30 May 1938, p 5 During the war he became musical director for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He was music director for the International Ballet company in 1945 (Her Majesty's and Princes), 1946 (Coliseum) 1947 (Adelphi), and 1948 (London Casino). Irving often worked with Thomas Beecham. Ealing Studios In the early 1930s Basil Dean appointed Irving music director at the newly opened Ealing Film Studios. He composed many scores for classic Ealing comedies including Whisky Galore!, Turned Out Nice Again (starring George Formby) and Kind Hearts and Coronets.Huntley, John. British Film Music (1947, revised 1972) But like his younger counterparts Muir Mathieson at Denham and Hubert Clifford at London Film Studios (who both worked closely with film producer and director Alexander Korda) Irving also brought in some of the best known composers of the day to provide music - including John Addison, William Alwyn, Georges Auric, Benjamin Frankel, John Ireland, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne, Ralph Vaughan Williams and William Walton. In this he had the backing of the studio's head of production Michael Balcon, who encouraged Irving to engage serious composers routinely and to use large orchestral forces and unusual scoring.Eder, Bruce. Ernest Irving biography Irving secured John Ireland for The Overlanders (1946), his only film score, and he asked Vaughan Williams to compose the music for three films, The Loves of Joanna Godden (1947), Scott of the Antarctic (1948) and Bitter Springs (1950). He helped fit the scores to the films.Vaughan Williams, Ralph. 'Ernest Irving: 1878-1953' in Music and Letters January 1054, p 17-18 Vaughan Williams dedicated the score of his Sinfonia Antartica (using music from the film score) to Irving in 1953. Rawsthorne's First Quartet (1939) and Walton's Second Quartet (1947) are also dedicated to him. Personal Life At the age of 20, Ernest Irving married Bertha Newall of Blackpool at Fylde register office on 11 May 1898. There were two children, but the marriage ended in divorce. He married his second wife Muriel Heath (1898-1983), a contralto who had sung in Lilac Time, on 19 December 1930. After the marriage, which produced one daughter, Irving suffered financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy. He acted as chess correspondent for the Illustrated London News between 1928 and 1932. On 22 March 1931 he was on the train from Euston which derailed at Linslade (near Leighton Buzzard), killing six people. In 1951 Irving received a rarely awarded honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society, and also had an honorary degree from the Royal Academy of Music. Irving retired from Ealing in May 1953 due to ill-health, his successor was Dock Mathieson, brother of Muir. At the time of his death five months later he was working on a comic operetta (The 'Orse) and had almost completed his autobiography (posthumously published in 1959 as Cue for Music).Letter to Vaughan Williams, 19 October, 1953 He died at his home (4 The Lawn, Ealing Green), aged 74.

History  The station was opened by the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway on 1 May 1903,Butt, page 165 as part of an extension from that company's previous northern terminus at to a junction with the Cathcart District Railway at Cathcart. The route was completed through to (on what is now the West Coast Main Line) the following year, giving the L&AR; a route between Lanarkshire and the coast at Ardrossan independent of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Though the line carried freight and express boat trains from Adrossan to Glasgow Central, Muirend was only ever served by local suburban workings. A connection was laid in south of the station down to the Busby Railway at around the same time as the L&AR; main line was opened, but it was never used for through traffic (only for wagon storage) and was disconnected by 1907 (though the brick viaduct it used still stands to this day),\\"The Origins of the Neilston Line\\" netherlee.org; Retrieved 31 August 2016 and only the crossover underneath the road bridge immediately south of the station remains of the kilometer long branch. Through passenger traffic over this route declined significantly after the 1923 Grouping and regular passenger trains were withdrawn beyond in 1932. Services through here were converted to diesel operation from 1958 and the Cathcart lines were subsequently electrified in 1962 (though the wires only ran as far as Neilston, the line beyond closing to passengers in April 1962 and completely in December 1964). Through trains to & Newton also ended at this time, with passengers henceforth having to change at . With popular demand, these services were reinstated in the 1980s. With electrification came the Class 303 'Blue Train' EMUs, which operated the Cathcart Circle and its branches until their withdrawal in the early 2000s. Class 314 EMUs cascaded from the Inverclyde routes by the introduction of the Class 334 Juniper EMUs took over workings, and were only replaced on the route a couple of months before their final withdrawal in December 2019. British Rail and SPTE proposals published in the early 1980s would have seen the Clarkston spur reopened and used by re- routed trains to/from , which would have then run to Glasgow Central via Cathcart & Queens Park. The scheme would also have seen the East Kilbride branch electrified, but the Clarkston to Busby Junction section closed (along with & stations, with the line cut back to ). The proposals were not well received and were never implemented.  Services and facilities  Services are now operated mainly by 4 car Class 380/1 EMUs, with the 3 coach Class 318 EMUs and Class 320 EMUs working together to provide 6 coach services at peak times. Two trains an hour operate in each direction calling all stops from Glasgow Central to Neilston. Additionally, additional peak time services operate between Central and Neilston, calling only from Muirend through to the terminus. Sunday services are also half hourly, but start around 3 hours later than on other days. The station has an island platform with a ramp providing access directly to the platform from Muirend Road at the south end of the station.

History and profile Respekt's first cover (March 14, 1990) Respekt was founded very soon after the fall of Communist party from power in 1989 by a group of samizdat journalists as one of the first independent magazines. It is the successor of Informaƒçn√≠ servis (Information service), an opposition samizdat paper. Respekt is published weekly and has its headquarters in Prague. The New York Times describes Respekt as \\"influential.\\" Several people involved with Respekt became influential in top level politics of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic; among them the first editor-in-chief Jan Ruml who served as the Minister of Interior between 1992 and 1997, Martin Fendrych (official at the Ministry of Interior) and (several ministerial position). Editors describe Respekt as \\"a liberal magazine which stands up for freedom of thought and the need of continuous questioning of its outcomes\\".https://www.facebook.com/pg/tydenikrespekt/about/?ref=page_internal The weekly concentrates on investigative journalism (often using information gleaned from police sources) and in-depth articles, and has been expanding to cover ecological activism and alternative culture movements in recent years. In 2005 Respekt published details about business connection between Prime Minister Stanislav Gross' wife and a brothel owner, starting a scandal leading to downfall of Gross several months later; in 2008 it published an article alleging that Milan Kundera, when a student, denounced to the police a Czech spy for the West.Ud√°n√≠ Milana KunderyMilan Kundera demands apology from Respekt for defaming him The circulation of the weekly peaked at over 100,000 copies in the middle of the 1990s. At this time the (loss generating) weekly was bought by Karel Schwarzenberg¬¥s R-Presse. The circulation has been dropping steadily over the time causing Respekt's losses to increase to 7 million Czk in 2003. In 2006 Zdenƒõk Bakala obtained majority in Respekt and planned to eliminate the loss by making the journal more mainstream. The proposed changes led to fear among both readers and the editors that the unique flavour of the weekly will be destroyed; in September 2006 all editors threatened to leave. Within a week the owners submitted to the pressure, recalled the manager responsible to implement the changes and brought in a new editor-in-chief, Martin M. ≈†imeƒçka, former editor-in-chief of the Slovak daily SME. Modification of the visual style and the format was delayed until September 2007. The circulation in 2006 was around 25,000 copies and the weekly was read by approximately 80,000 people each week. In 2007 the circulation was around 16-17,000 copies. According to a February 2008 survey, it is read by 94,000 people and remains one of the most cited journals and newspapers in the Czech Republic. Legal actions Since Respekt regularly reports on its investigations into bribery scandals, criminal activity or government mishandling, legal action is periodically taken against Respekt, often by top level politicians. Most of these cases that have gone to court have been won by the weekly. The most visible case was the Czech government's 2001 attempt to sue Respekt for libel. Milo≈° Zeman, the instigator of the case, saw it as a way to \\"put the journal to its end\\". The case fizzled away only embarrassing the government. Editors in chief Charter 77 signatory and the first editor of Respekt, Jan Ruml Erik Tabery was appointed editor-in- chief in 2009 * Jan Ruml (1990) * Ivan Lamper (1990‚Äì1994) * Vladim√≠r Mlyn√°≈ô (1994‚Äì1997) * Martin Fendrych (1998) * Petr Holub (1998‚Äì2002) * Tom√°≈° Nƒõmeƒçek (2003‚Äì2005) * Marek ≈†vehla (2005‚Äì2006) * Martin Milan ≈†imeƒçka (2006‚Äì2009) * Erik Tabery (2009‚Äìpresent) Visual style Respekt used its own distinguished visual style that stayed almost unchanged since 1990. With A3 format (24 or 32 pages) and black & white print it resembled more a daily newspaper than a magazine (most of the magazines in the Czech Republic are smaller and printed on glossy paper with heavy use of color and photos). Front cover drawings by illustrator Pavel Reisenauer very soon became a symbol of the weekly. After several years the front page drawings switched from black and white to color. Reisenauer also contributed with drawings on the back cover and for the articles. All photos were black and white, their number was intentionally kept down. Advertisements were added at the end of 1991 in limited form, compared to other Czech journals. The changes planned by the new owner in 2006 (glossy paper, use of color, coverage of day-to-day events or consumer advice) were cancelled at the time (see history above). In September 2007 the format has been changed, color replaced the black & white photos and the advertisement section was expanded. Web presence During the early 2000s all old issues of Respekt have been converted into electronic form and made available online for subscribers in PDF form. An attempt to establish a commercial news- bulletin sent by email failed. In 2006 Respekt was among the first Czech newspapers to provide blogging space for the public on their website.

They have released twelve albums and more than two dozen singles since their first single release \\"Sunrise\\" in 1997.  History  Piet Blank, who became interested in music after purchasing his first record \\"Kids in America\\" by Kim Wilde, had his first experience spinning a record on a turntable at age 16. Ren√© Runge, who resides in D√ºsseldorf and who is better known as Jaspa Jones, had his first experience as a DJ at age 19.\\"Blank_&_Jones_Biography_on_Laut.de\\".laut.de. Together with help from Andy Kaufhold, they formed the trance production team Piet Blank & Jaspa Jones (which would later become simply Blank & Jones) after meeting at the Popkomm music conference.[ \\"Blank_&_Jones_Biography_on_Billboard\\"].billboard.com. Even though they had been together for a few years, they did not release their first single, \\"Sunrise\\", until 1997. Their first album, In the Mix, was a studio production that came out in 1999. As of 2008, thirteen of their singles have made it into the German Top 50, and three into the Top 20. Each album made the Top 50, including two which reached the Top Ten. Blank & Jones have teamed up with Robert Smith from The Cure, Anne Clark, Sarah McLachlan, Claudia Br√ºcken from (Propaganda), Pet Shop Boys, and Delerium. They have also contributed to the Caf√© del Mar compilation series and produced their own chill-out albums, Relax, Relax (Edition 2), Relax (Edition 3), Relax (Edition 4), Relax (Edition 5), Relax (Edition 6) and Relax (Edition 7).  The Singles  In 2006 Blank & Jones and their long-standing production colleague Andy Kaufhold collated their finest material on one release, The Singles, which also included two new tracks: The album was also released in Limited Edition format, in which The Singles are complemented by a DVD, bringing together all Blank & Jones videos on one disc for the first time. The videos feature people such as Estella Warren and Til Schweiger in \\"Beyond Time\\", the latter having also directed the clip. The DVD was produced and designed by Thomas Jahn, scriptwriter and director of \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\" and also responsible for \\"The Hardest Heart\\", \\"Mind of the Wonderful\\", \\"Perfect Silence\\" and \\"Desire\\". The video for the single \\"Catch\\" was directed by Conchita Soares and Toni Froschhammer which features TV actress Nadine Warmuth.  Current activities  The chart success of Blank & Jones is partially based on their club-gigs, radio shows and other live-performances including events such as Love-Parade, StreetParade and Mayday. The success is further boosted by their activeness as moderators on Eins Live-TV and by being the Co-host on Viva-Clubrotation. When asked about the key to their success, their response is: Blank & Jones perform at major festivals and raves in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Russia. They also travel further afield on a regular basis, to Canada, Mexico, South America and Australia. Piet Blank is also the host of the Club Mix that is aired on international flights by Lufthansa, where he hosts a two-hour radio show that shows different artists such as Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Fritz Kalkbrenner. The show is hosted in German as well as in English. They released their latest single entitled \\"Miracle Cure\\" on May 30, 2008, off their new studio album The Logic of Pleasure which is a collaboration with New Order's frontman Bernard Sumner. This collaboration was realised with the help of renowned Berlin based record producer Mark Reeder who is a long term friend of Sumner's. Blank & Jones invited Reeder to remix \\"Miracle Cure\\" and this in turn, brought about their collaboration with him and a new project was conceived. This resulted in Reeder completely reworking most of the Blank & Jones vocal tracks for the successful and highly acclaimed 2009 album \\"Reordered\\".Mark Reeder- The Godfather 12-10-2009 .electronicbeats.net.

Biography He was born in Sydenham, Belfast, of a Protestant working-class family. His birthplace is marked by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque. While still in his teens, he contracted bone cancer and had a leg amputated. He studied for an MA in Poetic Drama at Queen's University, Belfast, on a scholarship, before commencing teaching in the United States at Hamilton College and Cornell University. Parker was a member of a group of young writers that included Seamus Heaney and Bernard MacLaverty in the early 1960s at Queen's University in Belfast. In British Poetry since 1945, Edward Lucie-Smith calls him \\"a rawer, rougher, more unformed poet than either of the other two Belfast poets presented here\\" (i.e. Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon). He notes that all three are post-Movement and neo-Georgian, owing little to William Butler Yeats and not much more to Patrick Kavanagh. Following his return to Northern Ireland he worked as a freelance writer, contributing a column on pop music to The Irish Times. He later moved to Great Britain, where he wrote for radio, television and the stage. The musical landscape of Belfast is integral to his work as a playwright. One could arguably call him the Van Morrison of Irish theatre. He would be honoured by the title, as Van Morrison was one of his favourite artists. Parker died of stomach cancer in London on 2 November 1988. Work His plays include Spokesong (1975), a musical Kingdom Come (1977), Catchpenny Twist (1977), Nightshade (1979), Pratt's Fall (1981), The Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner (radio 1979, filmed 1981),http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv- people/4ce2b7337350d Northern Star (1984), Heavenly Bodies (1986) and Pentecost (1987). The 1979 BBC Radio 4 production of The Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner featured John le Mesurier, among others. The stage plays are published by Methuen Drama. Stewart Parker: Plays 1 (2000) includes Spokesong, Catchpenny Twist, Nightshade and Pratt's Fall. Stewart Parker: Plays 2 (2000) includes Northern Star, Heavenly Bodies and Pentecost. An annual award (The Stewart Parker Trust Award) for best Irish debut play was set up in his name after his death. There is a cash bursary as part of the award. Previous recipients of the award include: Conor McPherson, Mark O'Rowe, Enda Walsh, Eugene O'Brien, Gerald Murphy, Lisa McGee and Christian O'Reilly. Several new publications appeared in 2008, the twentieth anniversary of Parker's death. These include: * A collection of Parker's articles on popular music for The Irish Times entitled High Pop: Irish Times Column 1970‚Äì1976, edited by Gerald Dawe and Maria Johnston (Belfast: Lagan, 2008) * A collection of Parker's reviews and articles on culture, entitled Dramatis Personae and Other Writings, edited by Gerald Dawe, Maria Johnston and Clare Wallace (Prague: Litteraria Pragensia, 2008) * A collection of Parker's plays for television, entitled Stewart Parker: Television Plays, edited by Clare Wallace (Prague: Litteraria Pragensia, 2008) .

Moore is most noted for an April Fool's Day prank he played to demonstrate that his fellow legislators often did not read the legislation they were approving and for being a member of the \\"Dirty Thirty.\\" Biography Moore was born in Waco, Texas, May 16, 1918. He served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946. From 1952-1959, as McLennan County district attorney, Moore prosecuted \\"the first criminal trial to be televised in the United States.\\" Boston Strangler prank Moore introduced legislation on April 1, 1971 commending Albert DeSalvo‚Äîmore commonly known as the Boston Strangler‚Äîincluding this wording: After it was passed unanimously by the House, Moore later withdrew the legislation, explaining he had only offered it to prove an important point that his fellow legislators didn't read much of the legislation they voted on. Dirty Thirty Moore, along with 29 other bipartisan members of the 1971 Texas House of Representatives, became known as the \\"Dirty Thirty\\" after allying against the then-Speaker of the House Gus Franklin Mutscher and other Texas officials who had been charged in a bribery-conspiracy investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dirty Thirty kept the Sharpstown Stock-Fraud Scandal alive as a political issue. Even though Mutscher was still favored by a majority in the House, they called for a resolution to make Mutscher and his associates resign from leadership positions while the SEC investigation continued. However, because of Mutscher's favored position, the measure failed in addition to another resolution, for the House to make itself a committee of the whole to study the SEC allegation. The Dirty Thirty's criticisms of Mutscher's system of controlling legislation eventually led Mutscher to agree to an investigation led by five of his closest House allies, all chairmen of other committees he had appointed, to do the job. On the next-to-last day of the session, Mutscher attacked the Dirty Thirty, accusing them of irresponsible, partisan politics and the Dirty Thirty called Mutscher a dictator of state politics, more concerned with private than public interests. This began the electoral battle, which Mutscher lost. Mutscher, along with two other colleagues (Governor Preston Smith and Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes), were indicted by a Travis County grand jury in September 1971 for conspiracy to accept a bribe and accepting a bribe. Mutscher was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to five years' probation. Mutscher's colleagues, though not brought to trial, saw their political careers effectively ended. The Dirty Thirty also paid a price - Mutscher blocked most of their legislation actions and they were isolated from other Texas legislators.

These practices, outlined by Yogi Swatmarama in the Ha·π≠ha Yoga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ as kriya, are Netƒ´, Dhautƒ´, Naulƒ´, Basti, KapƒÅlabhƒÅtƒ´, and TrƒÅ·π≠aka.Muktibodhananda, Swami. (1985).

New Delhi India: Thomson Press India, for The Yoga Publications Trust.These techniques and their practice are outlined in considerable detail by Swami Rama in his two volume set: Rama, Swami. (1988). Path of Fire and Light, Volume I: Advanced Practices of Yoga; Volume II: A Practical Companion to Volume I. Honesdale, Pennsylvania. Himalayan Institute Press. The Ha·π≠ha Ratnavali mentions two additional purifications, Cakri and Gajakarani, criticising the Hatha Yoga Pradipika for only describing the other six. Purpose Nauli, one of the shatkarmas, is the purification of the abdomen using the muscles of the abdominal wall. The shatkarmas are six (or more) preliminary purifications described in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and later texts. Their purpose is to remove \\"gross impurities\\", cure a range of diseases, and prepare the body for pranayama, trapping the breath so as to force the vital energy prana into the central sushumna channel, allowing kundalini to rise, and so to attain moksha, liberation. Description KapƒÅlabhƒÅtƒ´ The six purifications taught in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and repeated in the Gheranda Samhita, are: * Netƒ´ is a nasal wash. This is the practice of using a neti pot to cleanse the nasal passages. A basic neti wash consists of purified water and non-iodized salt, to create a gentle saline solution.demonstration * Dhautƒ´ is the cleansing of the whole digestive tract. * Naulƒ´ is a self-administered abdominal massage, using only the muscles of the abdominal wall. The practitioner stands with the feet about hip width apart, hands on knees, and body at about a 45 degree angle. The core is rotated internally by moving the abdominal muscles alternately in a clock- wise, then in a counterclock-wise direction. * Basti is a colonic irrigation. * KapƒÅlabhƒÅtƒ´ is a skull polishing, and is a pranayama (breathing) practice intended to energize and balance the nadis, and the chakras. Specifically, it is a sharp, short outbreath, followed by a relaxation of the core that allows the body to inhale on its own. * TrƒÅ·π≠aka is the direction of the gaze at a fixed point such as a black spot or a candle flame. The two additional purifications in the Hatha Ratnavali are: * Cakri is the dilation of the anus, using a finger moved about in the rectum. * Gajakarani (present but described differently in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika) is holding sweetened water and the breath in the oesophagus, followed by expulsion of its contents.

Ornithomimids were fast, omnivorous or herbivorous dinosaurs known mainly from the Late Cretaceous Period of Laurasia (now Asia and North America), though they have also been reported from the Lower Cretaceous Wonthaggi Formation of Australia. Description The skulls of ornithomimids were small, with large eyes, above relatively long and slender necks. All had toothless beaks. The fore limbs ('arms') were long and slender and bore powerful claws. The hind limbs were long and powerful, with a long foot and short, strong toes terminating in hooflike claws. Ornithomimids were probably among the fastest of all dinosaurs.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2011 Appendix. Like many other coelurosaurs, the ornithomimid hide was feathered rather than scaly. Biology Comparisons between the scleral rings of the genus Ornithomimus and modern birds and reptiles indicate that they may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. While little is known of ornithomimid reproduction, neonate ornithomimid fossils have been found representing either embryos or hatchlings.Tanke, D.H. and Brett-Surman, M.K. 2001.

E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 337-363. Diet Ornithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants. Many ornithomimosaurs, including primitive species, have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs, characteristic of herbivores. Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested that the long, sloth-like 'arms' of ornithomimids may have been used to pull down branches on which to feed, an idea supported by further study of their strange, hook-like hands. The sheer abundance of ornithomimids ‚Äî they are the most common small dinosaurs in North America ‚Äî is consistent with the idea that they were plant eaters, as herbivores usually outnumber carnivores in an ecosystem. However, they may have been omnivores that ate both plants and small animal prey. The feeding habits of ornithomimids have been controversial. In 2001 Norell et al. reported a specimen of Gallimimus (IGM 100/1133) and one of Ornithomimus (RTMP 95.110.1). These two fossil skulls had soft tissue preservation, and both had keratinous beaks with vertical grooves extending ventrally from the bony upper mandible. These structures are reminiscent of the lamellae seen in ducks, in which they function to strain small edible items like plants, forams, mollusks, and ostracods from the water. The authors further noted that ornithomimids were abundant in mesic environments, and rarer in more arid environments, suggesting that they may have depended on waterborne sources of food, possibly filter feeding. They noted that primitive ornithomimids had well developed teeth, while derived forms were edentulous and probably could not feed on large animals. One later paper questioned the conclusions of Norell et al. Barrett (2005) noted that vertical ridges are seen on the inner surface of the beaks of strictly herbivorous turtles, and also the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus. Barrett also offered calculations, estimating how much energy could be derived from filter feeding and the probable energy needs of an animal as big as Gallimimus. He concluded that herbivory was more likely. Classification Named by O.C. Marsh in 1890, the family Ornithomimidae was originally classified as a group of ornithopods. Two years later, Marsh described additional material and realized that ornithomimids were theropods. As relationships within theropods began to be resolved in the 20th century, Friedrich von Huene included Ornithomimidae in his infraorder Coelurosauria. Recognizing the distinctiveness of ornithomimids compared to other coelurosaurs, Rinchen Barsbold placed ornithomimids within their own infraorder, Ornithomimosauria, in 1976. Today, Ornithomimosauria is regarded as a clade within Coelurosauria. The contents of Ornithomimidae and Ornithomimosauria varied from author to author as cladistic definitions began to appear for the groups in the 1990s and 2000s. The cladogram below was the result of a study conducted in 2015 by Claudia Serrano-Branas and colleagues.

He studied in the Coll√®ge de Navarre, University of Paris, and in 1380 received the degree of Licentiate, and then later received a Master of Arts. He studied theology under Jean Gerson and Pierre d'Ailly, and received the degree of Bachelor of Theology in 1393. He had begun to lecture at the university in 1391 and was appointed its rector in 1393, a position he filled until 1395. The Church was then agitated by the Western Schism, and three methods were proposed to re-establish peace: compromise, concession, and a general council. From 1380 to 1394 the University of Paris advocated a general council. In 1394 another tendency was manifest; i.e. both Pope Boniface IX and Pope Clement VII were held responsible for the continuance of the schism, and their resignations decreed to be the means of obtaining peace. To this end a letter was written to King Charles VI by three of the most learned masters of the university, d'Ailly, Cl√©manges, and Gilles des Champs. Des Champs and d'Ailly prepared the content, to which Cl√©manges gave a Ciceronian elegance of form. The letter was unsuccessful, and the university was ordered to abstain from further discussion. Cl√©manges, forced to resign the rectorship of the university, then became canon and dean of Saint-Clodoald in 1395, and later on canon and treasurer of Langres. The antipope Benedict XIII, who admired his Latin style, took him for his secretary in 1397, and he remained at Avignon until 1408, when he abandoned Benedict because of the latter's conflict with Charles VI. Cl√©manges now retired to the Carthusian monastery of Valfonds, and later to Fontain-au-Bois. In these two retreats he wrote his best treatises, De Fructu eremi (dedicated to Pierre d'Ailly), De Fructu rerum adversarum, De novis festivitatibus non instituendis, and De studio theologico, in which latter work he exhibits his dislike for the Scholastic method in philosophy. In 1412 he returned to Langres, and was appointed Archdeacon of Bayeux. His voice was heard successively at the Council of Constance (1414), and at Chartres (1421), where he defended the \\"liberties\\" of the Gallican Church. In 1425 he was teaching rhetoric and theology in the College of Navarre, where, most probably, he died. Cl√©manges is also credited with the authorship of the work De corrupto Ecclesiae statu, first edited by Konrad Cordatus (possibly with Ulrich von Hutten) in 1513, a violent attack on the morality and discipline of the contemporary Church; hence he is sometimes considered a Reformer of the type of Wyclif and Hus. Schubert, however, in his book Ist Nicolaus von Cl√©manges der Verfasser des Buches De corrupto Ecclesiae statu? (Grossenhain, 1882; Leipzig, 1888) suggested that, although a contemporary, Cl√©manges was not the author of the book. His works were edited in two volumes by Johannes Martin Lydius a Protestant minister of Frankfort (Leyden, 1613). His letters are in Luc d'Achery's Spicilegium, volume I, 473 sqq.

It is a variant of heap sort that performs better when the data contains existing order. Published by Christos Levcopoulos and Ola Petersson in 1992, the algorithm utilizes a new measure of presortedness, Osc, as the number of oscillations. Instead of putting all the data into the heap as the traditional heap sort did, adaptive heap sort only take part of the data into the heap so that the run time will reduce significantly when the presortedness of the data is high.  Heapsort  Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that utilizes binary heap data structure. The method treats an array as a complete binary tree and builds up a Max-Heap/Min- Heap to achieve sorting. It usually involves the following four steps. # Build a Max-Heap(Min-Heap): put all the data into the heap so that all nodes are either greater than or equal (less than or equal to for Min-Heap) to each of its child nodes. # Swap the first element of the heap with the last element of the heap. # Remove the last element from the heap and put it at the end of the list. Adjust the heap so that the first element ends up at the right place in the heap. # Repeat Step 2 and 3 until the heap has only one element. Put this last element at the end of the list and output the list. The data in the list will be sorted. Below is a C++ implementation that builds up a Max-Heap and sorts the array after the heap is built. #include /* A C++ sample heap sort code that sort an array to an increasing order */ using namespace std; void heapify(int array[], int start, int end);// A function that build up a max-heap binary tree void heapify(int array[], int start, int end) { int parent = start; int child = parent * 2 + 1; while (child <= end) { if (child + 1 <= end ) //when there are two child nodes { if (array[child + 1] > array[child]) { child ++; //take the bigger child node } } if (array[parent] > array[child]) { return; //if the parent node is greater, then it's already heapified } if (array[parent] < array[child]) // when child node is greater than parent node { swap (array[parent], array[child]); // switch parent and child node parent = child; child = child * 2 + 1; //continue the loop, compare the child node and its child nodes } } } void heap_sort (int array[], int len); // heap_sort function void heap_sort (int array[], int len) { for (int i = len/2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) //Step 1: build up the max-heap { heapify(array, i, len); } for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) //Step 4: repeat step 2 and 3 till finished { swap(array[0], array[i]); // Step 2: put the max at the end of the array heapify (array, 0, i-1); // Step 3: remove the max from the tree and heapify again } } int main() { int array[] = {42, 1283, 123, 654, 239847, 45, 97, 85, 763, 90, 770, 616, 328, 1444, 911, 315, 38, 5040, 1}; //the array that will be sorted int array_len = sizeof(array)/sizeof(*array); //length of the array heap_sort (array, array_len);// heap sort return 0; }  Measures of presortedness  Measures of presortedness measures the existing order in a given sequence. These measures of presortedness decides the number of data that will be put in to the heap during the sorting process as well as the lower bound of running time.  Oscillations (Osc)  For sequence X = , Cross(xi) is defined as the number edges of the line plot of X that are intersected by a horizontal line through the point (i, xi). Mathematically, it is defined asCross(x_i) = \\\\\\\\{ j \\\\mid 1 \\\\leq j < n\\\\ and \\\\ \\\\min\\\\\\\\{ x_j, x_{j+1}\\\\\\\\} < x_i < \\\\max\\\\\\\\{ x_j, x_{j+1}\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}, for 1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n. The oscillation(Osc) of X is just the total number of intersections, defined as Osc(x) = \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\displaystyle\\\\lVert Cross(x_i) \\\\rVert.  Other measures  Besides the original Osc measurement, other known measures include the number of inversions Inv, the number of runs Runs, the number of blocks Block, and the measures Max, Exc and Rem. Most of these different measurements are related for adaptive heap sort. Some measures dominate the others: every Osc-optimal algorithm is Inv optimal and Runs optimal; every Inv-optimal algorithm is Max optimal; and every Block-optimal algorithm is Exc optimal and Rem optimal.  Algorithm  Adaptive heap sort is a variant of heap sort that seeks optimality (asymptotically optimal) with respect to the lower bound derived with the measure of presortedness by taking advantage of the existing order in the data. In heap sort, for a data X = , we put all n elements into the heap and then keep extracting the maximum (or minimum) for n times. Since the time of each max-extraction action is the logarithmic in the size of the heap, the total running time of standard heap sort is O(n log n). For adaptive heap sort, instead of putting all the elements into the heap, only the possible maximums of the data (max-candidates) will be put into the heap so that fewer runs are required when each time we try to locate the maximum(or minimum). First, a Cartesian tree is built from the input in O(n) time by putting the data into a binary tree and making each node in the tree is greater(or smaller) than all its children nodes, and the root of the Cartesian tree is inserted into an empty binary heap. Then repeatedly extract the maximum from the binary heap, retrieve the maximum in the Cartesian tree, and add its left and right children (if any) which are themselves Cartesian trees, to the binary heap. If the input is already nearly sorted, the Cartesian trees will be very unbalanced, with few nodes having left and right children, resulting in the binary heap remaining small, and allowing the algorithm to sort more quickly than O(n\\\\log n) for inputs that are already nearly sorted. Input: an array of n elements that need to be sorted Construct the Cartesian tree l(x) Insert the root of l(x) into a heap for i = from 1 to n { Perform ExtractMax on the heap if the max element extracted has any children in l(x) { retrieve the children in l(x) insert the children element into the heap } }  Drawbacks  Despite decades of research, there's still a gap between the theory of adaptive heap sort and its practical use. Because the algorithm makes use of Cartesian trees and pointer manipulation, it has low cache- efficiency and high memory requirements, both of which deteriorate the performance of implementations.

It benefits from the presortedness in the input sequence ‚Äì or a limited amount of disorder for various definitions of measures of disorder ‚Äì and sorts faster. Adaptive sorting is usually performed by modifying existing sorting algorithms.  Motivation  Comparison-based sorting algorithms have traditionally dealt with achieving an optimal bound of O(n log n) when dealing with time complexity. Adaptive sort takes advantage of the existing order of the input to try to achieve better times, so that the time taken by the algorithm to sort is a smoothly growing function of the size of the sequence and the disorder in the sequence. In other words, the more presorted the input is, the faster it should be sorted. This is an attractive algorithm because nearly sorted sequences are common in practice. Thus, the performance of existing sort algorithms can be improved by taking into account the existing order in the input. Note that most worst-case sorting algorithms that do optimally well in the worst-case, notably heap sort and merge sort, do not take existing order within their input into account, although this deficiency is easily rectified in the case of merge sort by checking if the last element of the lefthand group is less than (or equal) to the first element of the righthand group, in which case a merge operation may be replaced by simple concatenation ‚Äì a modification that is well within the scope of making an algorithm adaptive.  Examples  A classic example of an adaptive sorting algorithm is Straight Insertion Sort. In this sorting algorithm, we scan the input from left to right, repeatedly finding the position of the current item, and insert it into an array of previously sorted items. In pseudo-code form, the Straight Insertion Sort algorithm could look something like this (array X is zero-based): procedure Straight Insertion Sort (X): for j := 1 to length(X) - 1 do t := X[j] i := j while i > 0 and X[i - 1] > t do X[i] := X[i - 1] i := i - 1 end X[i] := t end The performance of this algorithm can be described in terms of the number of inversions in the input, and then will be roughly equal to , where is the number of Inversions. Using this measure of presortedness ‚Äì being relative to the number of inversions ‚Äì Straight Insertion Sort takes less time to sort the closer it is to being sorted. Other examples of adaptive sorting algorithms are adaptive heap sort, adaptive merge sort, patience sort, Shellsort, smoothsort, splaysort and Timsort.

He remained an obscure figure during his lifetime; most of his writings were unpublished for decades after his death. Biography Petterssons parents were elderly peasants, Joel's father being well over 50 at the time of Joel's birth. Joel had a younger brother Karl, who died at sea in 1916. Pettersson lived almost his entire life in Norrby Lemland, √Öland, where he had to take over the family farm although he lacked both interest and qualifications for small-farming. Pettersson began writing and painting in his early school years, though much of his works from this period were not preserved. Around the year 1913 he had the opportunity to study at the drawing school √Öbo Ritskola in Turku He stayed in Turku until 1915, when he decided to abort his studies and return to √Öland. He painted actively for a few years after the art school. Upon his return, Pettersson became active in the local youth organisation, for which he wrote plays and monologues. He directed plays, made scene set-ups, costumes and marionette dolls. Joelsson even had a one-man act called Uncle Joel writes and tells stories. He also wrote prose which he read out loud during organisation meetings. Pettersson was most active as a writer following his return from Turku until 1921. During the 1920s, Pettersson worked mostly on his parents' farm, only sporadically participating in the youth organisation's activities. His parents both died in 1928, leaving Pettersson to care for the farm. He sold all the animals and most of the property. He tried earning a living on art, but was unsuccessful. He then tried raising hens, but this also proved to be an unsuccessful venture. He resumed painting in 1935, and some of his paintings were displayed during an exhibition the following year. His constant economic difficulties and work load took their toll. In 1936, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to Grelsby Asylum, where he remained until his death in early 1937. Pettersson never married, although he was engaged for a brief period; his fianc√©e left for America. There is some speculation that Pettersson may have been bisexual.

He did not write in formal Swedish but relied heavily on the vocabulary of the local dialect, and publishers had little interest in publishing Joel's texts. Some of Joel's writings appeared in local publications, but most of it remained unpublished. In 1970, writer and rural dean Valdemar Nyman began editing and publishing Pettersson's writings, starting with Jag har ju sett in 1972, 35 years after Pettersson's death. Nyman also wrote an extensive biography of Pettersson, Pojken och den gr√•a byn (1977). In recent years Ralf Svenblad has edited and published some of Pettersson's works. Today, Joel Pettersson is considered to be one of the most important √Öland writers. Pettersson's expressionistic paintings were not appreciated during his life but his genuine painting has later given him the title of √Öland's van Gogh.

Frossard or Oscar Frossard, was a French socialist and communist politician. He was a founding member in 1905 and Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party (SFIO) from 1918 to 1920, as well as a founding member and Secretary-General of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 1920 to 1922. On 1 January 1923 Frossard resigned his positions and left the Communist movement over political differences. Frossard briefly attempted to establish an independent Communist political organization before returning to the ranks of the SFIO, gaining election to parliament under that party's banner in 1928, 1932, and 1936. From 1935 until 1940 Frossard held a series of ministerial positions in successive governments of Pierre Laval, Albert Sarraut, Camille Chautemps, L√©on Blum, √âdouard Daladier, Paul Reynaud, and the first government of Philippe P√©tain. Following the armistice between France and Nazi Germany, Frossard declined to participate in the Vichy French government headed by P√©tain, but continued to work as a journalist. His position led to his investigation, trial, and acquittal over accusations of collaborationism following the fall of the P√©tain regime. Early years He was born 5 March 1889 in Foussemagne, Territoire de Belfort, France. His father was a saddlemaker who was dedicated to his son's education and success in life.Albert S. Lindemann, The \\"Red Years\\": European Socialism Versus Bolshevism, 1919-1921. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1974; p. 153. Following completion of his schooling, Frossard became a schoolteacher, also working as a journalist.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; p. 128. He also became involve in Socialist politics, joining the Section fran√ßaise de l'Internationale ouvri√®re (SFIO), at the time of its formation in 1905. Early political career During World War I, Frossard supported the pacifist minority faction of the SFIO. As the bloody conflict ground on without remit, Frossard's antiwar perspective became the majority view in the SFIO, leading to his election as Secretary-General of the party in 1918. He would remain in that capacity until the SFIO split into socialist and communist wings at the December 1920 Congress at Tours. In the summer of 1920 Frossard travelled to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic along with his party comrade, Marcel Cachin; the two participated in the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International. Frossard was active upon his return to France in advocating for the affiliation of the SFIO to the Comintern, and he departed with the left wing at the Tours Congress to form the Communist Party of France (PCF); he was its Secretary-General. Frossard was twice re-elected as the head of the PhD and was endorsed both at its 2nd Congress at Marseilles in December 1921 and its 3rd Congress at Paris in October 1922. As the Comintern developed, Frossard came into disagreement with several of its policies, which brought him into conflict. He traveled again to Moscow in June 1922 to serve as a delegate to the 2nd Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), a journey that marked his second and final trip to Soviet Russia. Although he did not attend the 4th World Congress of the Comintern in November 1922, he was still elected a member of ECCI at that gathering, his last high position in the French Communist movement. Return to SFIO Frossard's dissatisfaction with the Comintern remained, however, and on 1 January 1923, he wrote a letter resigning from the Communist Party. He initially attempted to form a dissident Communist group but ultimately failed in this task and returned to participation in the SFIO, now headed by L√©on Blum. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower chamber of the French Third Republic, platform with the 1928 and the 1932 Cartel des gauches'. Later career He quit the SFIO group after the 1936 elections. His departure did not prevent him from becoming Minister of Propaganda (and the first one ever in this capacity) in Blum's Second Popular Front Ministry (March‚ÄìApril 1938). From 1935, Frossard had been a member of the governments of Pierre Laval and Albert Sarraut (as Labor Minister) as well as that of Camille Chautemps (as Minister of State of the Services of the Presidency of the council). Afterwards, he served as Minister of Public Works under Radical √âdouard Daladier and again as Minister of Propaganda under conservative Paul Reynaud. Frossard was made Minister of Public Works and Transmissions in the First Government of Philippe P√©tain after the Battle of France and the beginning of Nazi Germany's occupation of France. After the signing of the armistice between France and Germany, Frossard declined to be part of any Vichy France executive, but he still lent the regime tacit support by working as a journalist. Suspicion of collaboration with the enemy led to an enquiry into his activities at the end of World War II, but he was soon cleared. Death and legacy Frossard died 11 February 1946 in Paris.

Early life Hubert Paine was born in Shoreham-by-Sea, England, on 11 March 1891, to Henry Paine and Rosannah (n√©e Scott). He was educated at Shoreham Grammar School.Rance. Fast Boats and Flying Boats. p. 10 Supermarine Scott-Paine worked for Noel Pemberton Billing dealing in yachts, eventually in 1913 forming Pemberton-Billing Ltd (with 'Supermarine' as the telegraphic address), with Hubert the factory manager at Woolston, Hampshire. In 1916 Scott-Paine bought the company and renamed it the Supermarine Aviation Company Limited, building flying boats for the British Admiralty. Reginald Mitchell (of Spitfire fame) was employed at this time and the company greatly expanded. Hubert married Alice Brenda Hockey in 1917, having four children. By this time he had changed his surname by hyphenating his parent's surnames to create Scott-Paine. Channel Air Service In February 1919 Scott-Paine started the first cross-channel flying boat service, between Woolston and the Channel Islands and Le Havre, using converted Supermarine AD Flying Boats. His company was named the British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd. Schneider Trophy After his failed 1919 attempt for the Jacques Schneider Trophy, Supermarine won the Trophy in 1922 with its Sea Lion II. This allowed Britain to win it outright years later. Imperial Airways In 1923 Scott-Paine sold Supermarine (for ¬£192,000). In 1924 Imperial Airways was formed by the merger of Scott-Paine's British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd and three other airlines. He was a director of Imperial Airways until 1939. British Power Boat Company Cockpit of Miss England at the Science Museum in London The well-financed Scott-Paine now designed and raced power boats. In 1927 he bought the Hythe Shipyard, renaming it the British Power Boat Company. It was enlarged into one of the country's most modern mass production boat building yards. Many sophisticated award-winning racing boats were produced, an example being Miss England which is now on display at the Science Museum (London). In the 1930s the British Power Boat Company supplied seaplane tenders and armoured target boats to the Air Ministry, and tenders for Imperial Airways flying boats. T E Shaw (Lawrence of Arabia) assisted in the testing of these boats. Although the factory was destroyed by fire in 1931, it was rapidly rebuilt and no contracts were lost. Miss Britain III Hubert Scott-Paine testing Miss Britain III before the 1933 Harmsworth Trophy attempt During 1932 and 1933 Scott-Paine and Fred Cooper designed and built the single-engined Miss Britain III as a Harmsworth Trophy challenger. In a 1933 race Scott-paine was narrowly defeated by the four-engined Miss America X. In 1934 Miss Britain III set the world record for a single-engined boat of 110.1 mph. Miss Britain III is now on display at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. Motor torpedo boats From 1933 Scott-Paine designed and built hard chine motor torpedo boats, and MA/SB anti-submarine boats, from 1935 having them accepted by the Admiralty. Scott-Paine and George Selman designed and built a new private venture PV70, a seagoing MTB with three marinised Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. The boat was launched in 1938, but although no orders came from the Admiralty, orders were received from friendly governments. PT boats Elco PT boat PT-10 in 1941 In 1939 agreement was reached with the American Electric Launch Company (Elco) to purchase a British Power Boat 70-footer (later named PT9), as a template for American production under licence. PT9 was taken by the SS President Roosevelt to Elco‚Äôs works at New London, Connecticut. On 3 October Scott-Paine met President Roosevelt and senior Elco representatives at the White House to authorize the creation of a new naval arm, the PT Boat Squadrons. (PT boat was short for patrol torpedo boat). Production started at a new Elco factory at Bayonne, New Jersey in January 1940. The Canadian Power Boat Company was set up by Scott-Paine in 1940. This produced 39 boats, mainly MTBs. After the passing of Lend-Lease in 1941 comparative trials, nicknamed the Plywood Derbys, were held between rival American boatbuilders, Elco winning both. Elco went on to produce 754 70-, 77-, and PT boats, including Jack Kennedy‚Äôs PT109 as well as the boat that rescued General Douglas MacArthur from Corregidor. Later years In December 1944, Scott-Paine received a cheque for $200,000 with an accompanying letter of appreciation for his contributions made to the development of the PT boat from Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. The money was from Elco and was brokered by legal teams, releasing Elco from any and all further liabilities concerning the license rights. In 1945 all contracts at both the Canadian and British Power boat Companies were cancelled. Scott-Paine was divorced in 1946 and married Margaret Dinkeldein, his secretary, in New York in the same year. His health had not been good for years and in April, two months later, he suffered a stroke. In 1948 he was made an American citizen. Hubert Scott-Paine died at Greenwich, Connecticut, on 14 April 1954, aged 63.

The agency had three main divisions, the Department of Gaming, the Alberta Gaming Research Council, and the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission. It had oversight of the Alberta Lottery Fund, and it was responsible for the Horse Racing Alberta Act and Racing Appeal Tribunal. The last Minister of Gaming was Gordon Graydon. The Ministry was first created in 1999, although one of its components had then been the Community Lottery Program Secretariat. In December 2006, Premier Ed Stelmach abolished the Ministry of Gaming and folded it into other agencies in an effort to trim down government. At that time the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission moved under The Ministry of Solicitor General and Public Security. The Alberta Gaming Research Council, created on August 24, 1999, guided the activities of the Alberta Gaming Research Institute. Council members were appointed for a three-year term. The Alberta Gaming Research Institute still exists as a joint venture of the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, and the University of Lethbridge. It studies the positive and negative effects of gaming, trends, and matters relating to aboriginal gaming. Its $1.5 million annual budget is reliant upon the Alberta Lottery Fund. The Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission, abbreviated AGLC, became a part of the Ministry of Gaming on May 25, 1999. It was composed of a Corporation and a Board, which was charged with establishing policy, reviewing and approving liquor and gaming licenses and registrations, and conducting hearings into violations of legislation and matters relating to licenses and registrations. The Commission also enforced aspects of the Tobacco Tax Act with the Tobacco Enforcement Unit of the Commission's Investigations Branch. Under the jurisdiction of the Commission was also the Alberta Lottery Fund, composed of the government's $1 billion annual share of revenue from Video Lottery Terminals, ticket lotteries, and slot machines. The Alberta Lottery Fund was originally established in 1987 by Bill 10. In addition to funding the Alberta Gaming Research Council, it also fully funded the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission. A grand total of $1,207,533,000 came from the fund as the estimate of 2005/2006.

He is often regarded as the founder of English language lexicography. He was also an Anglican priest. Early life Mulcaster was possibly born in 1530 or 1531 in Brackenhill Castle. He was the son of William Mulcaster.  Education  In 1561 he became the first headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School in London, where he wrote his two treatises on education, Positions (1581) and Elementarie (1582). Merchant Taylors' School was at that time the largest school in the country, and Mulcaster worked to establish a rigorous curriculum which was to set the standard for education in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He was the mentor of Lancelot Andrewes who kept the subject's portrait above his study door.Bobrick, Benson. (2001). Wide as the waters: the story of the English Bible and the revolution it inspired.

Ed. Joyce M Horn. London: Institute of Historical Research, 1986. 87-89. British History Online Retrieved 22 June 2019. Writings Mulcaster‚Äôs most enduring work, Elementarie, was published in 1582. For the most part, it is a guide to good practice in teaching, particularly in the teaching of English. At a time when Latin still held all of the prestige in education, Mulcaster made a convincing case for the huge potential of English to serve all of the functions that were at that time reserved for Latin, calling for it to be more widely used and, crucially, respected. Elementarie is, in this respect, a call to national pride: \\"forenners and strangers do wonder at vs, both for the vncertaintie in our writing, and the inconstancie in our letters.\\" Provoking a movement that was to lead, ultimately, to English being the language of learning in the English- speaking world, the Elementarie argues \\"I do not think that anie language, ‚Ä¶ is better able to utter all arguments, either with more pith, or greater planesse, than our English tung is.\\" However, Mulcaster goes on to remind people of the need for the language to be codified and learnt, as Latin had thus far been: only \\"if the English utterer be as skillfull in the matter, which he is to utter\\" can English rival Latin. Lexicography To the end of establishing an English that could serve the complex needs of education, the Elementarie ends with a list of 8000 \\"hard words\\". Mulcaster does not define any of them, but attempts to lay down a standard spelling for them at a time when English lacked universal standardized spellings. Besides making movements toward spelling rules for English (such as the role of the silent e in vowel length in such pairs as bad and bade), the list represents a call for English to have its first dictionary, to gather \\"all the words which we use in our English tung ‚Ä¶ out of all professions, as well learned as not, into one dictionarie, and besides the right writing, which is incident to the Alphabete, [the lexicographer] wold open vnto us therein, both their naturall force, and their proper use.\\" The first English dictionary A Table Alphabeticall would be published over two decades later, in 1604. Football Richard Mulcaster's unique contribution is not only inventing the name \\"footeball\\" but also providing the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster confirms that his was a game closer to modern football by differentiating it from games involving other parts of the body, namely \\"the hand ball\\" and \\"the armeball\\". He referred to the many benefits of \\"footeball\\" in his personal publication of 1581 in English entitled Positions Wherein Those Primitive Circumstances Be Examined, Which Are Necessarie for the Training up of Children. He states that football had positive educational value and that it promoted health and strength. Mulcaster was one of the first advocates of the introduction of referees: \\"For if one stand by, which can judge of the play, and is judge over the parties, & hath authoritie to commande in the place, all those inconveniences have bene, I know, & wilbe I am sure very lightly redressed, nay they will never entermedle in the matter, neither shall there be complaint, where there is no cause.\\" Mulcaster's discussion on football was the first to refer to teams (\\"sides\\" and \\"parties\\"), positions (\\"standings\\"), the benefits of a referee (\\"judge over the parties\\") and a coach \\"(trayning maister)\\". Mulcaster describes a game for small teams that is organised under the auspices of a referee (and is therefore the first evidence that his game had evolved from disordered and violent \\"mob\\" football): \\"Some smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one another so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges\\". Politics Mulcaster was a Member of Parliament for Carlisle in 1559.

Marshall Handbook of Optical and Laser Scanning, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2004, Scanned laser beams are used in some 3-D printers, in rapid prototyping, in machines for material processing, in laser engraving machines, in ophthalmological laser systems for the treatment of presbyopia, in confocal microscopy, in laser printers, in laser shows, in Laser TV, and in barcode scanners. Technology Scanning mirrors Laser scanning module with two galvanometers, from Scanlab AG. The red arrow shows the path of the laser beam. Most laser scanners use moveable mirrors to steer the laser beam. The steering of the beam can be one-dimensional, as inside a laser printer, or two-dimensional, as in a laser show system. Additionally, the mirrors can lead to a periodic motion - like the rotating mirror polygons in a barcode scanner or so-called resonant galvanometer scanners - or to a freely addressable motion, as in servo-controlled galvanometer scanners. One also uses the terms raster scanning and vector scanning to distinguish the two situations. To control the scanning motion, scanners need a rotary encoder and control electronics that provide, for a desired angle or phase, the suitable electric current to the motor or galvanometer. A software system usually controls the scanning motion and, if 3D scanning is implemented, also the collection of the measured data. In order to position a laser beam in two dimensions, it is possible either to rotate one mirror along two axes - used mainly for slow scanning systems - or to reflect the laser beam onto two closely spaced mirrors that are mounted on orthogonal axes. Each of the two flat or polygonal mirrors is then driven by a galvanometer or by an electric motor. Two- dimensional systems are essential for most applications in material processing, confocal microscopy, and medical science. Some applications require positioning the focus of a laser beam in three dimensions. This is achieved by a servo-controlled lens system, usually called a 'focus shifter' or 'z-shifter'. Many laser scanners further allow changing the laser intensity. In laser projectors for laser TV or laser displays, the three fundamental colors - red, blue, and green - are combined in a single beam and then reflected together with two mirrors. The most common way to move mirrors is, as mentioned, the use of an electric motor or of a galvanometer. However, piezoelectric actuators or magnetostrictive actuators are alternative options. They offer higher achievable angular speeds, but often at the expense of smaller achievable maximum angles. There are also microscanners, which are MEMS devices containing a small (millimeter) mirror that has controllable tilt in one or two dimensions; these are used in pico projectors. Scanning refractive optics When two Risley prisms are rotated against each other, a beam of light can be scanned at will inside a cone. Such scanners are used for tracking missiles. When two optical lenses are moved or rotated against each other, a laser beam can be scanned in a way similar to mirror scanners. Material effects Some special laser scanners use, instead of moving mirrors, acousto-optic deflectors or electro-optic deflectors. These mechanisms allow the highest scanning frequencies possible so far. They are used, for example, in laser TV systems. On the other hand, these systems are also much more expensive than mirror scanning systems. Phased array scanning Research is going on to achieve scanning of laser beams through phased arrays. This method is used to scan radar beams without moving parts. With the use of Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSELs), it might be possible to realize fast laser scanners in the foreseeable future. Applications 3D object scanning A high speed mobile laser scanning system for 3D data acquisition mounted on an automobile. Within the field of 3D object scanning, laser scanning (also known as lidar) combines controlled steering of laser beams with a laser rangefinder. By taking a distance measurement at every direction the scanner rapidly captures the surface shape of objects, buildings and landscapes. Construction of a full 3D model involves combining multiple surface models obtained from different viewing angles, or the admixing of other known constraints. Small objects can be placed on a revolving pedestal, in a technique akin to photogrammetry.Dassot, M., Constant, T., & Fournier, M. (2011). The use of terrestrial LiDAR technology in forest science: application fields, benefits and challenges. Annals of forest science, 68(5), 959-974. 3D object scanning allows enhancing the design process, speeds up and reduces data collection errors, saves time and money, and thus makes it an attractive alternative to traditional data collection techniques. 3D scanning is also used for mobile mapping, surveying, scanning of buildings and building interiors, and in archaeology. Material processing Depending on the power of the laser, its influence on a working piece differs: lower power values are used for laser engraving and laser ablation, where material is partially removed by the laser. With higher powers the material becomes fluid and laser welding can be realized, or if the power is high enough to remove the material completely, then laser cutting can be performed. Modern lasers can cut steel blocks with a thickness of 10 cm and more or ablate a layer of the cornea that is only a few micrometers thick. The ability of lasers to harden liquid polymers, together with laser scanners, is used in rapid prototyping, the ability to melt polymers and metals is, with laser scanners, to produce parts by laser sintering or laser melting. The principle that is used for all these applications is the same: software that runs on a PC or an embedded system and that controls the complete process is connected with a scanner card. That card converts the received vector data to movement information which is sent to the scanhead. This scanhead consists of two mirrors that are able to deflect the laser beam in one level (X- and Y-coordinate). The third dimension is - if necessary - realized by a specific optic that is able to move the laser's focal point in the depth-direction (Z-axis). Scanning the laser focus in the third spatial dimension is needed for some special applications like the laser scribing of curved surfaces or for in-glass-marking where the laser has to influence the material at specific positions within it. For these cases it is important that the laser has as small a focal point as possible. For enhanced laser scanning applications and/or high material throughput during production, scanning systems with more than one scanhead are used. Here the software has to control what is done exactly within such a multihead application: it is possible that all available heads have to mark the same to finish processing faster or that the heads mark one single job in parallel where every scanhead performs a part of the job in case of large working areas. Barcode readers Many barcode readers, especially those with the ability to read bar codes at a distance of a few meters, use scanned laser beams. In these devices, a semiconductor laser beam is usually scanned with the help of a resonant mirror scanner. The mirror is driven electromagnetically and is made of a metal-coated polymer. Space flight When a space transporter has to dock to the space station, it must carefully maneuver to the correct position. In order to determine its relative position to the space station, laser scanners built into the front of the space transporter scan the shape of the space station and then determine, through a computer, the maneuvering commands. Resonant galvanometer scanners are used for this application.

NC 740 through Badin is decorated with many town banners and street lights; most of the stoplights are found on the street corners rather than suspended from overhead wires. After it goes through the town, NC 740 skirts along the banks of Badin Lake before going northwest to New London, where it ends.  History  Established around 1930 as a spur of NC 74 (renumbered NC 73 in 1934), it connected Albemarle to the town of Badin then back to New London, ending at NC 80 (current NC 8). In 1933, it was extended north, replacing some of NC 62; but then reverted to original terminus in 1935, replaced by NC 62A and later NC 8\\\\.

It is one of the largest mosques in Western Europe. Completed in 2003 at a cost of ¬£15 million, entirely from donations of Ahmadi Muslims, the full complex accommodates 13,000 people. The main mosque (pictured right) has a height of 23m above ground, and to maximise capacity the building extends below ground. Baitul Futuh is located in the south-west London suburb London Borough of Merton. It is situated next to Morden South railway station, 0.4 miles from Morden Underground station (Northern line) and one mile from Morden Road tram stop. This mosque is the central complex of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. It is notable for being a base of local community service by the Community. Baitul Futuh has featured in national newspapers for its homeless feeding and national/local community cohesion efforts, noted under 'Community Cohesion'. Similarly, the design of the main Mosque aimed to combine traditional Islamic design with modern British architecture. Baitul Futuh has a history of notable events. It featured in the 2015 TV documentary 'Britain's Biggest Mosque' by Channel 5. Similarly, the mosque is host to the weekly Friday Sermons delivered by the Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, which are relayed live across a global TV network with satellite network MTA International. History 2003 Inauguration Mirza Tahir Ahmad, who was the head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community at the time, launched an appeal for funds for the building on 24 February 1995, and the land, formerly occupied by an Express Dairies depot, was purchased on 29 March 1996. The designs were produced by Oxford architectural studio, Sutton Griffin. The foundation stone was placed by the late Mirza Tahir Ahmad on 19 October 1999 in a ceremony attended by 2,000 guests, and inaugurated by the current head of the worldwide Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, on 3 October 2003. The opening ceremony was attended by over 600 guests; those present included High Commissioners, Deputy High Commissioners, Members of European Parliament, Members of Parliament, Mayors of London boroughs, Councillors, university lecturers, and representatives of 17 nations. 2015 Fire On 26 September 2015, a major fire broke out at the administrative side of the mosque complex - adjacent to the main mosque. The fire brigade were called at 12:20 noon and the blaze was soon declared a 'major incident'. 10 fire engines, an aerial platform and 80 fire-fighters tackled the fire. The fire was under control at 5:32pm, more than 5 hours after the initial report, and was extinguished after 30 hours of firefighting. By the end of the day, no suggestion of a deliberate attack was made. Two teenagers were arrested the following day on suspicion of arson. However, the elder of the two was soon released without charge. The majority of the building damage occurred at the front of the complex, within the administrative block of the site (which consisted of office space and function halls). The men's and women's prayer area were not affected. According to news reports, 50% of the ground floor, as well as the first floor and the roof were ablaze. The site was evacuated by site staff and one man was hospitalised after he collapsed and blacked out from smoke inhalation. London Fire Brigade later reported that the \\"mosque itself is thankfully unaffected\\". Extensive structural damage led to complex demolition work (adjacent to the functioning TV studio, major A-road and main mosque) over several months in 2017. The blaze created a huge plume of smoke, visible for miles in South West London, and caused widespread traffic congestion, bus disruption and rail suspension. The A24 London Road, a major London A-road, was shut down for hours because of its proximity to Baitul Futuh.  Notable events  * In 1999, the foundation stone was laid by Mirza Tahir Ahmad (the fourth head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Community). * In 2010, Baitul Futuh hosted BBC Radio 4's Question Time with Jonathan Dimbleby, Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee, Minister Sadiq Khan, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats Simon Hughes, MP Daniel Hannan and a studio audience of 400. * The mosque was voted one of the ‚ÄòTop 50 Buildings in the World‚Äô by Spectator magazine in 2010. * Lord Eric Avebury was awarded the first Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize, in recognition of his lifetime of human rights work, at the National Peace Symposium hosted at Baitul Futuh in 2010. * The 2010 plan to burn the Qur'an by the Pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center on the 9th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks was strongly condemned at the Baitul Futuh mosque by British faith leaders, representing various faiths, such as Church of England, Catholic Church, Judaism, Bah√° º√≠ Faith and other Christian and Islamic sects. * The Baitul Futuh Mosque acted as the centre for the UK-wide Loyalty, Freedom and Peace Campaign, which challenged stereotypes of the faith, removed misconceptions, started conversations and improved the integration of Muslims and non-Muslims. The campaign was famed for featuring on the side of red buses across London. * In August 2013, the mosque was the location of the largest Eid celebration in the UK of 15,000 people.Eid: British Muslims Join In Celebrations retrieved 10 August 2013 * Home Secretary Theresa May toured the Baitul Futuh Mosque complex in May 2015 and addressed 200 members of the community to take questions and commend the relief efforts of Humanity First, the international aid charity run by volunteers of the Ahmadiyya Community. * In 2015, massive preparations for Eid celebrations at Baitul Futuh Mosque were filmed by Channel 5 for the behind-the-scenes TV documentary Britain's Biggest Mosque. The one-off special was broadcast in 2016. Channel 5 included the 2015 fire in their programme. * The site hosts the annual National Peace Symposium which includes the awarding of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize. Speakers have included the head of the Ahmadiyya Community Mirza Masroor Ahmad, politicians such as Boris Johnson and the heads of various British and global faiths. * The 13,000-capacity complex is host to the weekly Friday Sermons delivered by the head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad. These sermons are relayed live to social media and the community's worldwide TV network, including the UK Sky 'MTA' channel. Community Cohesion The Morden Mosque is notable for its efforts in serving the greater community. Baitul Futuh has featured in national news for its peace work and community cohesion efforts. The design of Baitul Futuh also aims to combine modern British architecture. Several events are held at the Baitul Futuh Mosque to serve the greater community. The complex hosts school tours, local college exams, local community events, multi-faith conferences, the annual National Peace Symposium, and visiting dignitaries. In addition to regular congregational prayers, its services include weekly homeless feeding across London, volunteering events, local community events and the 'Merton Youth Partnership Annual Conference‚Äô, and the hosting of the BBC Radio 4 Programme Any Questions?,. The Mosque receives over 10,000 visitors a year from schools, open events, faith groups, public service organisations, charities, local and central government. The National Peace Symposium 2010 chose the location to award the first Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize to Lord Eric Avebury. The award was for lifetime contribution to global Human Rights. The Peace Prize is awarded annually \\"in recognition of an individual‚Äôs or an organisation‚Äôs contribution for the advancement of the cause of peace\\". The Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize has since been awarded annually at the Peace Symposium hosted at the Baitul Futuh Mosque. The Baitul Futuh Mosque acted as the centre for the UK-wide 'Loyalty, Freedom and Peace Campaign', which sought to challenge stereotypes of the faith, remove misconceptions, start conversations and improve the integration of Muslims and non-Muslims. In 2018, Baitul Futuh was one of the UK Ahmadi Mosques to host 'The Big Iftar', a gathering to break the fast during Islam's holy month of Ramadan. Ahmadi Muslims were encouraged to invite their neighbors, in addition to the open invitation on social media. Londoners from across the capital attended to tour the site and sit together for an evening meal. The Big Iftar has run since 2013. Baitul Futuh is also part of Open House London - an annual event in September with \\"free entry to London's best buildings\\".Merton Site Redevelopment for 2020 Eid at Baitul Futuh Mosque, showing a previous building (office space and function halls) before 2015 fire damage and demolition Reconstruction of office space and function halls in the Baitul Futuh Mosque site Plans were made to redevelop the administrative block (consisting of office space and function halls) damaged by a large fire in September 2015. Proposals for the reconstruction were designed by renowned London architecture firm John McAslan + Partners. Reconstruction funds were raised from fire damages repaid by the insurer, and additional donations from the British Ahmadi community.[51] The London architectural studio published its initial concepts online in July 2016. In January 2017, several months of complicated demolition work took place in close proximity to the major A24 London Road, Morden South Railway Station bridge and the adjacent functioning main Mosque. Planning and consultation work for the rebuild also took place in 2017/2018. The new Foundation Stone was placed by Mirza Masroor Ahmad, head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, on 4 March 2018. Following this ceremony, a two-year expectation was set for the new building to open. Construction work began in October 2018 and is active. MTA Television Studios The Baitul Futuh complex includes the Mosque and an administrative block, which is the location of the UK studio of the MTA International Studios (Muslim Television Ahmadiyya). There are two studios on site that are home to several television shows and other media relayed to the MTA online channels and television channels in the UK (e.g. the Sky MTA channel) and globally. MTA has a complete post production studio on site that processes its broadcast material. The fundamental role of MTA is to provide a platform for the head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, to address his community members across the globe and also the wider global audience. Baitul Futuh also serves as the location of the weekly Friday Sermons delivered by Mirza Masroor Ahmad and these sermons are live broadcast globally on MTA's television channels and social media channels. The studio also hosts the Voice of Islam radio station. Facilities Apart from two separate large prayer halls in the mosque for women and men, the complex includes the following facilities: *Offices *Islamic book store *The Aftab Khan Library *Khilafat Centenary Gallery (exhibition space) *Multi-functional halls *MTA Television Studios and the Voice of Islam (VOI) radio station *Kitchen & Dining Hall *Guest rooms *Disabled access *Wash-room facilities  Architectural Design  Minaret of Baitul Futuh The Baitul Futuh complex includes the mosque and an administrative block. A standout design feature of the mosque is the 18 metre diameter \\"shimmering silver dome\\" made of stainless steel (as reviewed by Exploring Surrey's Past). The interior of this dome is lined with hand-painted silver Arabic calligraphy from the Quran. The mosque's two upper (above ground) and lower (below ground) prayer halls span spaces of 28m x 36m. The exterior walls of the mosque are made with polished marble tiles. Huge glass panels make the entrance to the mosque. The mosque was designed from the ground up, the adjoining multi-functional halls were renovated from an existing derelict dairy building. The original site's chimney was converted into the 35m minaret featured right. Oxford architectural studio Sutton Griffin designed the complex and Carter Jonas designed the mosque with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association. The design of Baitul Futuh aims to combine modern British architecture, and the environmentally-friendly building design won the prestigious Green Award. Renowned architects John McAslan + Partners, notable for King's Cross station and The Roundhouse in London, were chosen to design a large administration block in the location of the previous block which was damaged by a serious fire in 2015. Baitul Futuh was voted one of the ‚ÄòTop 50 Buildings in the World‚Äô by Spectator magazine. The mosque was also listed in the 'Best 50 Modern Religious Buildings' published by The Independent newspaper.

The town is an example of star fort of the late Renaissance, built up by the Venetian Republic in 1593. The fortifications were included in UNESCO's World Heritage Site list as part of Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra ‚Äì western Stato da Mar in 2017.  Geography  Located in the southeast part of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia, it is from Udine, from Gorizia and from Trieste, near the junction of the motorways A23 and A4.  History  On 7 October 1593, the superintendent of the Venetian Republic founded a revolutionary new kind of settlement: Palmanova. The city‚Äôs founding date commemorated the victory of the Christian forces (supplied primarily by the Italian states and the Spanish kingdom) over the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, during the War of Cyprus. Also honored on 7 October was Saint Justina, chosen as the city's patron saint. Using all the latest military innovations of the 16th century, this small town was a fortress in the shape of a nine-pointed star, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi. Between the points of the star, ramparts protruded so that the points could defend each other. A moat surrounded the town, and three large, guarded gates allowed entry. The construction of the first circle, with a total circumference of , took 30 years. Marcantonio Barbaro headed a group of Venetian noblemen in charge of building the town, Marcantonio Martinego was in charge of construction, and Giulio Savorgnan acted as an adviser.\\"Renaissance war studies\\", John Rigby Hale, London Hambledon Press, 1983, pg. 185 A second phase of construction took place between 1658 and 1690, and the outer line of fortifications was completed between 1806 and 1813 under the Napoleonic domination. The final fortress consists of: 9 ravelins, 9 bastions, 9 lunettes, and 18 cavaliers. In 1815 the city came under Austrian rule until 1866, when it was annexed to Italy together with Veneto and the western Friuli. Until 1918, it was the one of easternmost towns along the Italian-Austro Hungarian border and during the first world war the city worked as a military zone hosting even a hospital for the royal army. In 1960 Palmanova was declared a national monument. American professor Edward Wallace Muir Jr. said on Palmanova: \\"The humanist theorists of the ideal city designed numerous planned cities that look intriguing on paper but were not especially successful as livable spaces. Along the northeastern frontier of their mainland empire, the Venetians began to build in 1593 the best example of a Renaissance planned town: Palmanova, a fortress city designed to defend against attacks from the Ottomans in Bosnia. Built ex nihilo according to humanist and military specifications, Palmanova was supposed to be inhabited by self-sustaining merchants, craftsmen, and farmers. However, despite the pristine conditions and elegant layout of the new city, no one chose to move there, and by 1622 Venice was forced to pardon criminals and offer them free building lots and materials if they would agree to settle the town.\\"  Ideal city of the Renaissance  Palmanova was built following the ideals of a utopia. It is a concentric city with the form of a star, with three nine-sided ring roads intersecting in the main military radiating streets. It was built at the end of the 16th century by the Venetian Republic which was, at the time, a major center of trade. It is actually considered to be a fort, or citadel, because the military architect Giulio Savorgnan designed it to be a Venetian military station on the eastern frontier as protection from the Ottoman Empire. During the renaissance many ideas of a utopia, both as a society and as a city, surfaced. Utopia was considered to be a place where there was perfection in the whole of its society. This idea was started by Sir Thomas More, when he wrote the book Utopia. The book described the physical features of a city as well as the life of the people who lived in it. His book sparked a flame in literary circles. A great many other books of similar nature were written in short order. They all followed a major theme: equality. Everyone had the same amount of wealth, respect, and life experiences. The society had a calculated elimination of variety and a monotonous environment. The city where they lived was always geometric in shape, and was surrounded by a wall. These walls provided military strength, but also protected the city by preserving and passing on man‚Äôs knowledge. The knowledge, learning and science gave form to the daily life of the people living inside the walls. The knowledge of each person was shared by the entire society, and there was no way to let any information either in or out. As Thomas More said in his book, \\"He that knows one knows them all, they are so alike one another.\\" Alberti, followed by Filarete, were the first to develop the ideas of Utopia into the plan of a city. Filarete designed a concentric city, with peaks and radiating streets, which he called Sforzinda. His geometry was the imitation of a schema representing the work. It is believed to have derived from two overlaying squares. Sforzinda later became the most influential plan in the design of Palmanova. Since Palmanova was built during the renaissance, it imposed geometrical harmony and followed the idea that beauty reinforces the wellness of a society. Each road and move was carefully calibrated and each part of the plan had a reason for being. Each person would have the same amount of responsibility and land, and each person had to serve a specific purpose. The concentric shape was the most prominent design move, and had many reasons for being. The circular shape of Palmanova was greatly influenced by the fact that it needed to be a fort. At the time of its construction, many other urban theoreticians found the checkerboard was more useful, but it could not provide the protection that military architects desired. The walls of a practical fort are run at angles so that enemy soldiers could not approach it easily because the angles made it possible to establish overlapping fields of fire.  Main sights   Cathedral  The cathedral is located in front of the town hall of Palmanova (formerly the Palace of Provveditore). Commissioned in 1603, the construction started later that year under Inspector Girolamo Cappello, and was completed in 1636. The identities of any architects are uncertain, but may have been Vincenzo Scamozzi and Baldassare Longhena. The cathedral was not consecrated until 1777, after the town had been included into the Archbishopric of Udine. The bell tower of the cathedral, erected in 1776, was deliberately made short because enemies attacking the city should not be able to see the cathedral from outside the city walls. The niches in the fa√ßade contain statues representing the saints Justina of Padua, one of Padua's patron saints, and Mark, as well as a statue of Christ, the Redeemer. The fa√ßade itself is made of stone from Istria, and was restored in 2000.

Ducal Prussia was often counted as part of the Greater Poland; Inflanty (Livonia) as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ruthenian territories were split between Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy.

He composed instrumental, chamber, orchestral and choral works. While his music is not widely known today, his Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 8 and his Five Bagatelles, Op. 9, for piano are still performed. His works represent some of the most important 20th-century music to emerge from Northern Ireland. Biography Ferguson was born in Belfast and attended Rockport School in Holywood, County Down, where his musical talent was recognized, leading to several school prizes. The pianist Harold Samuel heard him in 1922 and encouraged his parents to allow him to travel to London to become his pupil. Following further studies at Westminster School, Ferguson entered the Royal College of Music in 1924 to study composition with R. O. Morris and Ralph Vaughan Williams. He also studied conducting with Malcolm Sargent and formed a friendship with fellow-student Gerald Finzi with whom he attended Richard Strauss's Alpine Symphony at the Royal Albert Hall. His early compositions such as his Octet of 1933 (scored for the same forces as Franz Schubert's octet) met with considerable success. During World War II, Ferguson helped Myra Hess run the popular, morale-boosting series of concerts at the National Gallery. From 1948 to 1963 he taught at the Royal Academy of Music, his students there including Richard Rodney Bennett and Cornelius Cardew. He regarded Bennett as having an astonishing natural talent, though lacking a personal musical style. His music has a haunting, searching quality, as if a deeply personal question is being asked, but never answered (Tait 2007, see below). In the song cycle Discovery, the surrealistic poetic language of Denton Welch (\\"What are you in the morning when you wake? A quacking duck, a quacking drake?\\") is the ideal spark for Ferguson to express such private questioning in his aphoristic, fleeting settings (Tait). Ferguson produced what (according to Tait) is probably one of the greatest British solo piano works of the twentieth century, the stormy and passionate Piano Sonata, Op. 8, inspired by the death of a friend. Of his two violin sonatas, the second emerged after a long silence just after World War II; the ferocious energy of its finale has a spirit of escape and liberation, a suppressed voice finally speaking (Tait) (Ferguson had not had the time to compose during the war due to his other commitments). His miniatures, such as the Four Short Pieces for clarinet and piano and the Three Sketches for flute and piano, have a crystalline intensity, as if hinting at much larger works (Tait) ‚Äì Anton Webern was a composer he admired, even if stylistically Ferguson's own work belongs to the sound world of twentieth century Romanticism. Ferguson was always highly self-critical as a composer: after writing the large choral work The Dream of the Rood in 1958-9, he received a commission to write a string quartet. It was during the composition of this that he felt he was merely repeating his previous work, so he destroyed the sketches and gave up composing, saying that in his relatively few works he had said all he wanted to say. For the next decades he concentrated on musicology. His editions of such repertoire as early keyboard music and the complete piano sonatas of Schubert are outstanding, with a meticulous attention to detail which makes them authoritative (Tait). In his later years he lived in a white-painted converted farmhouse in Barton Road in Cambridge, his quiet hospitality legendary (Tait). He wrote a cookbook in the 1990s, Entertaining Solo, which commemorates the remarkable welcome he gave to so many friends, as does the memoir mentioned below. In the same decade he also prepared an edition of letters between himself and the composer Gerald Finzi, which is an invaluable source of information on the professional lives of Ferguson and his circle. Late in his life, a friendship with the German singer Reiner Schneider- Waterberg led to his rediscovering a song written in 1958 as part of incidental music for a William Golding play, The Brass Butterfly, and subsequently rearranging it for counter-tenor and piano (originally harp) as \\"Love and Reason\\" (1958/1994), a moving postscript to a compositional output whose great characteristic is powerful emotions expressed through superb and strictly controlled craftsmanship.

Life Anna was a daughter of Prince Dmitry Borisovich of Rostov and a great-granddaughter of Prince Vasily of Rostov. From her earliest years, Anna was brought up strictly Christian. She was taught the virtues of humility and obedience. Her teacher was Saint Ignatius, Bishop of Rostov (died 1288), who was noted for strict selflessness and pacifism. Like all royal daughters of her time, Anna learned different kinds of needlework. When the princess grew up, Princess Xenia of Tver, second wife of Grand Prince Yaroslav of Tver sent ambassadors to Rostov with a request to marry Anna to her son Mikhail. The embassy was successful, and Anna became the wife of Prince Mikhail. Princess Anna's marriage to Prince Mikhail took place on 8 November 1294 in the Preobrazhensky cathedral of Tver. In celebration of this event, dwellers in the city of Kashin built the Saint Michael Church and the triumphal gates from the local Kremlin to the Tver road, naming the gates also \\"Mikhaylovsky.\\" In the Kashin Uspensky cathedral a special Feast was established and celebrated annually on 8 November. Anna and Mikhail had five children: # Feodora (died in infancy) # Prince Dmitry of Tver (1299‚Äì1326) # Prince Alexander of Tver (1301‚Äì1339) # Prince Konstantin of Tver (1306‚Äì1346) # Prince Vasily of Kashin (d. after 1368) In 1294, her father died, and in 1295 a terrible fire destroyed Tver. Soon after that, Anna and Mikhail's first-born daughter, Feodora, fell severely ill and died in infancy. In 1296, another fire destroyed their palace, and the prince and princess were barely rescued. In 1317, a war began between her husband and Prince Yury of Moscow. In 1318 the princess said goodbye to her husband forever, who was summoned to the Horde, where he was brutally tortured to death on 22 November 1318. Only in July of the following year did Anna hear about her husband's martyrdom. Learning that Mikhail's remains had been brought to Moscow, she sent an embassy there, and her husband's body was transferred into Tver and buried in Preobrazhensky cathedral. In 1325, her eldest son, Dimitry, was tortured in the Horde. In 1327, her second son, Alexander, broke the Tartar army, which devastated the duchy. In revenge Uzbeg Khan gathered a new army and destroyed Tver; Prince Alexander was forced to hide in Pskov. For ten years, Anna did not see her son, and in 1339 Prince Alexander and his son Feodor were killed by the Horde. After the death of Prince Mikhail, Anna carried out an old desire \\"in silence to work only for God.\\" She took vows in Sofia's monastery in Tver and adopted the name Evfrosiniya. In 1365 the youngest son of the princess, Vasiliy, her only child remaining alive by that time, entreated his mother to move to his principality. The Uspensky monastery was built in Kashin, and there the saint accepted the schema with the name of Anna. She died of old age on 2 October 1368, and was buried in the cathedral temple of the Blessed Virgin. Canonization Icon of Holy Anna of Kashin The name of the Princess Anna was forgotten for many centuries. It was during the 1611 siege of Kashin by Lithuanian troops that Anna appeared to Gerasim, Sexton of the Dormition Cathedral, and it is said that she prayed to the Saviour and Our Lady for the deliverance of her city from the foreigners. Her relics were reported to work miracles. The synod of the Russian Orthodox Church convened in 1649 and declared her relics worthy of a universal homage. The princess was glorified as a saint. Twenty-eight years later, Patriarch Joachim addressed the Moscow Synod with a suggestion to decanonize her because of the uncommon veneration and esteem for Anna among the Old Believers. It was traditionally thought the Old Believers chose Anna as their palladium because the princess was represented on icons as making the Sign of the Cross with two fingers, as the Old Believers practiced, rather than with three, as official church policy required after Patriarch Nikon in 1656. However, writings used by the Old Believers show that one of the reasons they venerated her so highly was that her incorrupt body, on display, showed her hand in the two-fingered Sign of the Cross favoured by the Old Believers, vindicating their stance. Despite numerous efforts of the Church authorities to \\"correct\\" the situation, her hand always went back to the same two-fingered position. In response, Patriarch Joachim removed the relics of Anna from public view. Grand Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Joachim collected, held in Moscow from January to February 1678 decanonization Anna of Kashin: forbade her to pray, and allowed only pray for her - by her serve memorial service.:ru:–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ–±–æ—Ä (1678) It was not until 12 June 1909 that the Russian Orthodox Church glorified Anna again and sanctioned a general celebration of her cult. That year a monastic community was dedicated to her in Grozny. A year later, a church was consecrated in her name in St Petersburg. References  Bibliography  * S.

The program was hosted by Jack Linkletter. It primarily featured pop-oriented folk music acts, including The Journeymen, The Limeliters, the Chad Mitchell Trio, The New Christy Minstrels, The Brothers Four, Ian & Sylvia, The Big 3, Hoyt Axton, Judy Collins, Johnny Cash, The Carter Family, Flatt & Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys, The Tarriers, Bud & Travis, and the Smothers Brothers. Although both popular and influential, the program is primarily remembered today for the controversy created when the producers blacklisted certain folk music acts, which then led to a boycott by others. History Hootenanny was created in 1962 by Dan Melnick, Vice President of ABC-TV, and the Ashley-Steiner Talent Agency.\\"Strum Along with 'Hootenanny'\\" by Cecil Smith, TV Channels, January 19, 1964 The pilot was conceived as a half-hour special. The agency and network hired producer-director Gil Cates to oversee the initial production. It was Cates‚Äô idea to tape the program at a college campus, and to liberally include the student audience on camera, singing and clapping along with the music. Cates staged the show as theater in the round, with the students seated on the floor or in bleachers, surrounding the performers.\\"Helmsman of the Pilot Ship\\", TV Guide, issue of July 25, 1964, pp.22-23 With Cates at the helm, the pilot was video taped in the fall of 1962 at Syracuse University in New York.\\"Hootenanny Goes on the Air\\" by John P. Shanley, New York Times, April 14, 1963, Section II, p.15 Fred Weintraub, owner of The Bitter End, a folk music club in New York‚Äôs Greenwich Village, served as talent coordinator (and would continue to do so throughout the series‚Äô run), ensuring that performers would not be limited to clients of the Ashley-Steiner agency. New York radio personality Jean Shepherd was the original emcee, and four folk acts appeared in the pilot: The Limeliters, Mike Settle, Jo Mapes and Clara Ward‚Äôs Gospel Singers.\\"Top Folk Singers Will Perform on Video\\" by Fred H. Russell, Bridgeport Post, November 10, 1962, p.7 Rather than showcase acts once per show, each performer/group would do a song, then yield the stage to another and return later in the program. Occasionally two otherwise unrelated acts would team up for a duet. The final result was so well-received by network executives that the idea of airing the pilot as a stand-alone special was jettisoned, and production on the series began. Producer Richard Lewine was put in charge and Garth Dietrick assumed the Director‚Äôs chair. The first thing Lewine did was to replace Shepherd with Jack Linkletter. (When the original pilot aired in June 1963, Shepherd's scenes had been removed and Linkletter was spliced in.\\"Folk Music Heritage Wide Claims 'Hootenanny' Host\\", Syracuse Post-Standard, November 16, 1963) As Shepherd had done, Linkletter would discreetly provide information about the performer(s) and/or the song(s) they would sing as each act took the stage. Linkletter described his role as \\"an interpreter. The people at home hear what I have to say, but not the ones at the performance. (The feeling is) that the Hootenanny would be going on whether we were there or not.\\"\\"Who gives a hoot?\\" by Aleene MacMinn, TV Channels, April 28, 1963 On February 26, 1963, their first two Hootenanny programs were taped at George Washington University in the District of Columbia.\\"GWU Students Hoot It Up for ‚ÄòHootenanny‚Äô\\", Variety, February 27, 1963 Series production and reaction Between February 26 and April 30, 12 Hootenanny shows were taped at six colleges. The production team would arrive at a campus on Monday to begin rehearsal and camera blocking. Taping of both half-hour programs would take place on Tuesday (later, when Hootenanny expanded to an hour, one program each would be taped on Tuesday and Wednesday). Students were permitted to attend the rehearsals, many of them volunteering to be runners for the various acts and production staff.\\"Hootenanny Sends Sound of Folk Music Through Halls of Ivy\\" by Paul Gardner, New York Times, November 17, 1963, Section II, p.17 The first Hootenanny to air had been taped at the University of Michigan in March, and starred The Limeliters, Bob Gibson, Bud & Travis and Bonnie Dobson. (Easily the best known folk group among those who appeared, The Limeliters would headline in seven of the first 13 episodes, literally appearing at least every other week.) Overall, critical reaction was favorable, although Variety's reviewer felt it \\"lacked the spark and spirit that is found in 'live' college and concert dates\\" and predicted the series would do little to increase the popularity of folk musicReview of Hootenanny, Variety, April 10, 1963 ‚Äì a prediction that would soon prove erroneous. Most critics agreed with the New York Times‚Äô Jack Gould, who labeled Hootenanny \\"the hit of the spring.\\" \\"TV: ‚ÄòHootenanny‚Äô Debut\\" by Jack Gould, New York Times, April 8, 1963, p.95 The Nielsen ratings justified ABC‚Äôs faith in the concept. The first program garnered a 26% share of the viewing audience; this increased to 32% for the second show. By the end of April, ABC announced that Hootenanny would return in the fall as a one-hour show, provided the ratings held up.\\"‚ÄôHootenanny‚Äô Looms As Hour ‚Äô63-‚Äô64 Entry; Ratings Start To Swing\\", Variety, April 24, 1963 Which they did - Hootenanny soon became the network‚Äôs second-most popular show, after Ben Casey, with a peak audience of 11 million viewers per week.\\"ABC‚Äôs TV Hootenanny Show\\", Hootenanny Songs and Stars, Winter 1964, pp. 10-11 By the time Hootenanny concluded its first 13 weeks, a craze had been born. A front-page Variety story noted that \\"the big demand for the folk performers in virtually all areas of show biz (records, concerts, college dates, TV, pix) is stimulating a new folk form that can appeal to a mass audience. Among writers now contributing to the new-styled folk song are Bob Dylan, Mike Settle, Tom Paxton, Shel Silverstein, Bob Gibson, Malvina Reynolds, Oscar Brand, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie.\\"\\"Folk Music‚Äôs Tin Pan Alley\\" by Mike Gross, Variety, July 3, 1963 MGM‚Äôs Sam Katzman produced Hootenanny Hoot, a motion picture featuring The Brothers Four, Johnny Cash, Judy Henske, Joe and Eddie, Cathie Taylor, The Gateway Trio and Sheb Wooley ‚Äì all of whom did or would appear on Hootenanny. Record labels from the independent Folkways and Elektra to the mainstream Columbia and RCA-Victor released folk music compilation albums with \\"Hootenanny\\" in the title. Magazines Robert Shelton's Hootenanny magazine Two bi-monthly magazines appeared on newsstands: Hootenanny, edited by Robert Shelton with Lynn Musgrave, and ABC-TV Hootenanny, edited by music critic Linda Solomon. Mainstream magazines such as Time and Look reported on the folk craze, with the latter calling Hootenanny the \\"final proof that folk music has gone big- time.\\"\\"Folk Singers and Their Fans,\\" Look, August 27, 1963 Despite its popular appeal - or perhaps because of it - the overall reaction to Hootenanny by serious folk music critics was one of scorn. In an article for Shelton's Hootenanny magazine, Nat Hentoff savaged the program, writing \\"Aside from the fact that a sizable proportion of each week's cast has been echt fake, the 'Hootenanny Show' aura has also diluted the work of many of its performers with some credentials as folk singers.\\" He also chided the students comprising the audience: \\"(Be) not deceived that the campus activists for social change are in the majority. If you want to see the moyen American college student, watch the TV 'Hootenanny' show.\\"\\"Requiem for Saturday Night Television\\" by Nat Hentoff, Hootenanny, Vol.1 No. 3, May 1964 Editor Shelton, however, eventually acknowledged that \\"some good performances did sneak through; some obscure musicians won recognition. The TV series probably led millions of its viewers toward quality song.\\"Shelton, Robert, No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan, 1986, published by Beech Tree Books division of William Morrow; page 169 Renewal and format changes When the series resumed in the fall of 1963, it had been expanded to a full hour with a slightly altered format. Although the program continued to primarily showcase folk music, other genres were added to the mix: jazz (represented by such performers as Herbie Mann, Pete Fountain, Stan Getz and Stan Rubin's Tigertown Five), country (artists such as Johnny Cash, Eddy Arnold, Flatt & Scruggs and Homer & Jethro) and gospel (The Staple Singers, Clara Ward, Bessie Griffin and Alex Bradford). The second season also added a spot for stand-up comedy; the best-known participants being Woody Allen, Bill Cosby (in his network TV debut), Jackie Vernon, Pat Harrington, Jr. and Stiller & Meara. Changes in the format continued as the season progressed. Commencing with episodes airing in January 1964, all the artists remained on stage throughout the show, seated behind whoever was performing; and Jack Linkletter no longer made all the introductions - many were handled by the artists themselves, one act introducing another. A permanent theme song was also introduced this season: Hootenanny Saturday Night, written by Lewine and Alfred Uhry. The theme was performed by the artists appearing that particular week; although the Chad Mitchell Trio were the first to sing it, the version performed by The Brothers Four at the University of Pittsburgh was released by Columbia Records as a single. The second season also saw the debut of Hootenanny's \\"home-grown\\" creation, The Serendipity Singers. \\"Discovered\\" by talent coordinator Fred Weintraub, the Serendipities were a nine-member folk chorale closely patterned after The New Christy Minstrels. The group appeared in eight of the 30 shows produced that season, and had a major hit in spring 1964 with \\"Don't Let the Rain Come Down (Crooked Little Man)\\". The group, with various member changes, continued for decades after Hootenanny's demise. Controversy First issue of Linda Solomon's ABC-TV Hootenanny magazine Even before it reached the airwaves, Hootenanny created controversy in the folk music world. In mid- March, word circulated that the producers would not invite folk singer Pete Seeger, nor Seeger‚Äôs former group The Weavers, to appear on the show. Both Seeger and the Weavers were alleged to have overly left-wing views; in Seeger‚Äôs case, he had been convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to discuss his political affiliations with HUAC in 1955 ‚Äì although the conviction had been overturned on appeal in May 1962. Variety broke the story in its March 20, 1963, issue, reporting that folksinger Joan Baez had refused to appear on the show because of the blacklisting.\\"Talent Boycott Threatened in Ban Of Seeger, Weavers on ‚ÄòHootenanny‚Äô\\", Variety, March 20, 1963 That same week, several folk artists gathered at The Village Gate in New York City to discuss forming an organized boycott, but opted instead to send telegrams of concern to ABC executives, producer Lewine and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\\"Six More Folkniks Nix ‚ÄòHootenanny‚Äô\\", Variety, March 27, 1963 Although Seeger and the Weavers were also banned from NBC and CBS variety shows, the Hootenanny issue rankled because Seeger and his long-time associate Woody Guthrie were the first to popularize the term ‚Äòhootenanny‚Äô as a gathering of folk musicians. Seeger encouraged his fellow artists not to boycott but to accept Hootenanny invitations, so as to promote the popularity of the folk genre. Nevertheless, by the end of March three other folk acts had joined Joan Baez in boycotting the show: Tom Paxton, Barbara Dane and The Greenbriar Boys, a bluegrass trio. Some weeks later, Guthrie disciple Ramblin' Jack Elliott announced he, too, was boycotting Hootenanny.\\"Jack Elliot Joins Ranks of ‚ÄòHoot‚Äô and Holler Boys In Ban on ABC-TV Show\\", Variety, April 24, 1963 Over the years, other arguably better-known folk performers have been associated with the Hootenanny boycott; these include Dylan (who mentioned the show in his song \\"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\\"), Peter, Paul & Mary, Phil Ochs and The Kingston Trio. However, the ones who specifically announced their participation in the boycott at the time were Joan Baez, Barbara Dane, Tom Paxton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott and The Greenbriar Boys. The Greenbriar Boys eventually appeared on the October 19, 1963, broadcast, backing Los Angeles folk and country singer Dian James. However, John Herald, the band's guitarist and lead vocalist, did not participate. Some artists who had performed on the show would refuse future Hootenanny appearances for creative, rather than political, reasons; these include Judy Collins\\"Why I Quit the ABC-TV Show\\" by Judy Collins and Robert Shelton, Hootenanny, Vol.1 No. 2, March 1964 and Theodore Bikel. With the expansion of Hootenanny to one hour weekly, effective with the broadcast of September 21, 1963, the producers made overtures to Pete Seeger. However, there was a caveat, spelled out in a letter from network executives: \\"ABC will consider Mr. Seeger‚Äôs use on the program only if he furnishes an affidavit as to his past and present affiliations, if any, with the Communist Party, and/or with the Communist front organizations. Upon so doing, the company will undertake to consider his statement in relation to all the objective data available to it, and will advise you promptly [if] it will approve the employment of Mr. Seeger.\\"\\"ABC Finally Puts Itself on Record Re ‚ÄòHootenanny‚Äô\\", Variety, September 11, 1963 Seeger, naturally, refused to provide anything that smacked of a loyalty oath, and his manager, Harold Leventhal, made the story public\\"Seeger Bars Oath for TV ‚ÄòHootenanny‚Äô\\", New York Times, September 6, 1963, p.59 \\\\- which only encouraged others to refuse appearances. Cancellation ABC tentatively renewed Hootenanny for a third season, but a major shift in popular music brought about a last-minute reversal. The 1964 British Invasion eclipsed the folk music craze among younger viewers, resulting in a decline in Hootenanny‚Äôs viewership to about seven million by the end of April 1964, prior to the start of reruns.\\"Two Paths of Folk Music,\\" Hootenanny, Vol.1 No. 3, May 1964 Not only viewers, but musicians, were affected by the Invasion; performers such as Gene Clark (The New Christy Minstrels), John Phillips (The Journeymen), Cass Elliot (The Big 3) and John Sebastian (The Even Dozen Jug Band) - all of whom had appeared on Hootenanny's second season - abandoned folk music to form very successful pop- rock groups including The Byrds (Clark), The Mamas & the Papas (Phillips and Elliott) and The Lovin' Spoonful (Sebastian). There were other factors that contributed to Hootenanny's demise, not least of which was repetition of both songs and artists. Eventually, it seemed that audiences were likely to see The Serendipity Singers, or The New Christy Minstrels, or The Brothers Four every time they watched; occasionally, they would see two of these three teams. Faced with both a dwindling talent pool and growing viewer indifference (it didn't help that more viewers were watching Jackie Gleason on CBS at the same hour), on June 8 ABC announced that Hootenanny would be cancelled. Another series with youth appeal, The Outer Limits, moved into the timeslot; to replace that program on Wednesday evenings, ABC hastily scheduled a new music series: Shindig!\\"Hootenanny Dropped: Monsters to Replace Folk Singers on TV.\\" Cynthia Lowry, Corpus Christy Times, June 9, 1964. The network erased its videotapes of the show many years ago, but kinescopes of several Hootenanny segments survive and were used to compile the Best of Hootenanny DVD set from Shout! Factory. Colleges and universities Hootenanny taped 43 programs at 22 different institutions of higher learning, mostly private colleges and universities. Eight land-grant universities hosted the show: Pennsylvania State University; Rutgers (1st season); University of Arizona; UCLA; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Florida; University of Tennessee; Purdue University (2nd Season). Two Ivy League schools were visited: Brown University (1st season) and Dartmouth College (2nd Season); the latter during its annual Winter Carnival. Hootenanny shows were also taped at two United States Service academies: The United States Naval Academy, Annapolis MD and the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY (2nd Season). At the request of the then-President of Miles Laboratories, one of the show‚Äôs sponsors and an alumnus, Hootenanny visited the small Salem College in Clarksburg, WV (2nd season).\\"The Alkalizer Goes to a Hootenanny\\", The Alkalizer, Jan-Feb 1964, employee newsletter of Miles Laboratories, Inc.

The park was opened on 7 December 2003, and features industrial artefacts from its previous use by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company. Public art which draws upon the park's industrial heritage are also featured throughout, as is a crop patch which reflects the site's farming days. Rocks Riverside Park is the largest riverfront park in Brisbane. It has 800 metres of riverfrontage and covers an area of 26 hectare. The park is nestled in amongst other industrial sites at 5 Counihan Road, Seventeen Mile Rocks in Brisbane, Australia. The project architect was Cenk Yuksel. The main builders were Naturform and Stewart Constructions. Features The park is broken into three major zones. There is the river flat, a formerly rich riparian environment, then market garden and industrial site; the bushland range, which forms the backdrop for the river flat area covered with dry eucalypt forest; and a major green link from the park to the suburbs to the south. 360¬∞ Panoramic view of Rocks Riverside Park Features include a water play area, a flying fox, shelters, lawns, bushland, gardens and electric barbecues. There are also adventure playgrounds, a climbing web, bikeways, a basketball court, a liberty swing for children with disabilities, an amphitheatre, a pavilion, and open spaces for lawn gatherings. Five areas of the park are available for bookings. Water mining The park features an underground, non-drinking water recycling project. Sewer grinding, ultraviolet disinfection and a reed bed treatment process were used. The treatment process has a low environmental impact, is cost-effective and low-maintenance. The system allows the park to be watered during drought when water restrictions would otherwise apply.  Rocks Community Garden  Rocks Community Garden is a community garden in Rocks Riverside Park, first established in June 2007. It is volunteer-managed and focused on the organic production of food crops. Community garden membership is open to anyone who supports organic gardening principles and accepts the rules and operating guidelines. The community garden has 34 individual allotments and 9 raised garden beds which plot holders rent on a yearly basis. There is also have a small orchard, which members assist in maintaining. History The Rocks Riverside Park area has had many different uses over its lifetime. Irish immigrants, Robert and Frances Henry bought the land and cleared the dense scrub and vine thickets from the site. Sugar Cane, Oats, Barley and Corn were grown on the site until the land was sold in the 1920s. From the late 1940s to the 1960s Tomatoes, Capsicum, Beet and Peanuts were grown by Frank Pettinato, a Sicilian immigrant. During this time Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL) set up their operations in the area, as the site was a good source of fresh water, gravel and sand. Dead coral was brought up the Brisbane River from Moreton Bay as this was found to be a good substitute for lime. In 1995, the Queensland Government decided not to renew QCL's licence to remove coral from Moreton Bay. The last shipment was received in 1997 and most of the coral used in 1998, resulting in the closure of the plant in 1999. Park development Brisbane City Council decided to redevelop the site in 1999. The council's vision for the site was to \\"create a significant, contemporary riverside park that showcases the innovative design and sustainable management for the enjoyment of all residents.\\" Hassell was commissioned to generate the initial master plan which was completed in 2000. However, due to a change in design direction, land acquisition and a refinement in the budget the master plan required major alterations. City Design ‚Äì landscape Architecture was commissioned for the redesign of park to ensure that the park was innovative and sustainable. City Design- Landscape Architecture and Hassel worked together to create the revised master plan. Signage by Dot Dash creates an identifiable look to the park, whilst complying with Brisbane City Council logo standards. Colours based on an architectural colour scheme provides cohesion throughout the parks built environment and with printed material. The general layouts of the signs are typically light green plates with cut-outs for major headings and white writing for long blocks of information. This plate is always attached to an abstract piece of galvanised steel which has lines of dots running at right angles punctured through it. Awards Rocks Riverside Park won the Playground and Recreational Association of Victoria's Innovation Award in 2003. Brisbane City Council also received a Year of the Built Environment Award from the Australian Institute of Project Management in 2003, recognising the park as \\"an outstanding example of the Council‚Äôs achievements in managing the construction and refurbishment of Brisbane‚Äôs built spaces and parklands.\\" The water mining project won a Water Saving Award from the Department of Infrastructure and Transport in 2006.

In 1970, she told The Washington Post, \\"I've been a feminist for 20 years, and I'm all for advancing women in public office.\\" Her top assistant was a lawyer named Elizabeth Hanford, whom she introduced to her future husband, Robert Dole. In office, Knauer promoted recycling and nutritional labeling, unit pricing of groceries, and other consumer-friendly features. She predicted that, because of domestic automakers' reluctance to install safety and environmental improvements, among other advances, foreign manufacturers would increase their share of the U.S. auto market. She also headed the Office of Consumer Affairs during the Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan administrations. Family Knauer married Wilhelm F. Knauer, a lawyer, in 1940. Wilhelm Knauer served as Pennsylvania Deputy Attorney General. He died in 1976. The Knauers had one son, Judge Wilhelm F. Knauer Jr. (died 1986), one daughter, Valerie Knauer Burden, and three granddaughters, Virginia Burden, Frances Burden, and Nancy J. Knauer. Virginia Knauer died October 16, 2011, of congestive heart failure, in Washington, D.C.

Susan Sontag, a longtime friend of the publication, referred to it as \\"simply my favorite little magazine.\\" In The Book Wars, James Atlas writes that Salmagundi is \\"perhaps the country's leading journal of intellectual opinion.\\" History and profile Salmagundi was founded by Robert Boyers in the fall of 1965, using money he earned as a youth, singing at his neighborhood Jewish temple, and at weddings and Bar Mitzvahs. Boyers drew inspiration for his quarterly from other \\"little magazines\\" of the era, such as Partisan Review, F.R. Leavis's Scrutiny, and T.S. Eliot's Criterion, among others. The title of the magazine was chosen as a reference to the 19th-century periodical of the same name, published by Washington Irving. In 1969, the magazine moved its headquarters to Skidmore College, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Boyers and his wife, Margarita \\"Peg\\" Boyers are both professors in Skidmore's English Department. The magazine celebrated its Fiftieth Anniversary in 2015 by publishing three large volumes, featuring \\"Best Of\\" selections from Salmagundi's first five decades.

The site is a Scheduled Monument in the care of English Heritage and is open to visitors. Built around 290 AD and known to the Romans as Anderitum, the fort appears to have been the base for a fleet called the Classis Anderidaensis. The reasons for its construction are unclear; long thought to have been part of a Roman defensive system to guard the British and Gallic coasts against Saxon pirates, it has more recently been suggested that Anderitum and the other Saxon Shore forts were built by a usurper in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to prevent Rome from reimposing its control over Britain. Anderitum fell into ruin following the end of the Roman occupation but was reoccupied in 1066 by the Normans, for whom it became a key strategic bulwark. A stone keep and fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible break in the early 13th century when it was slighted. It had been abandoned again by the late 16th century and remained a crumbling, partly overgrown ruin until it was acquired by the state in 1925. Pevensey Castle was reoccupied between 1940 and 1945, during the Second World War, when it was garrisoned by units from the Home Guard, the British and Canadian armies and the United States Army Air Corps. Machine-gun posts were built into the Roman and medieval walls to control the flat land around Pevensey and guard against the threat of a German invasion. They were left in place after the war and can still be seen today. Pevensey is one of many Norman castles built around the south of England. Location and dimensions 250px Pevensey Castle was constructed by the Romans on a spur of sand and clay that stands about above sea level. In Roman times this spur was a peninsula that projected into a tidal lagoon and marshes, making it a strong natural defensive position. A harbour is thought to have been situated near the south wall of the castle, sheltered by a long spit of shingle where the village of Pevensey Bay stands now. A small river, Pevensey Haven, runs along the north side of the peninsula and would originally have discharged into the lagoon, but is now largely silted up.Lynne, p. 6 Since Roman times, silting and land reclamation in the Pevensey Levels have pushed the coastline out by about , leaving the castle landlocked. The land between the castle and the sea is now a flat marshland drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated mostly to the east of the castle, at the end of the ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages.Foot, p. 512 An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now marshland and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.Ordnance Survey ‚Äì Explorer 123. Publication date 10/02/2012 The castle occupies an area of about . It has an oval plan on a north-east/south-west alignment, measuring by .Johnson (1989), pp. 157‚Äì160 Not only is it the largest of the nine Saxon Shore fortsFields, p. 9 but its walls and towers are the largest of any surviving Roman fort of the period. Its shape is unique among Saxon Shore forts and was presumably determined by the contours of the peninsula on which it stands.Goodall, pp. 12‚Äì13 Architecture Curtain wall and towers The Roman west curtain wall of Pevensey Castle View from the inner bailey showing the west side of the Roman wall The castle's curtain wall is built on a massive scale, with ramparts and projecting towers still standing up to high (and probably about high when built) and thick at the base.Pearson, p. 86 The north, east and west sections of the curtain wall have survived mostly intact, with the exception of one fallen segment of the north wall; the south wall, which would have adjoined sea or marsh, has almost entirely disappeared.Goodall, p. 29 It is faced with ironstone and sandstone, though most of the original facing stones have been robbed out over the centuries; the structure visible now consists mostly of the rubble and sandstone core, bound together with mortar. Bonding courses of tiles run horizontally through the wall.Goodall, p. 14 An impression of its original appearance can be gleaned from an area in the north wall which has been excavated down to the still-intact foundations, revealing how it was once faced on both sides with small blocks of stone.Goodall, p. 15 The wall originally had a stepped appearance with at least two levels of steps on the interior face, though there is no surviving indication of how the garrison reached the top. At the top of the wall the remains of medieval crenellations can still be seen, which probably replaced Roman originals. The D-shaped towers along the curtain wall are similar to those of several other Saxon Shore forts, although their placement is somewhat unusual.Goodall, p. 18 Because the fort was partly surrounded by marshes and water, which provided natural defences, the Romans economised by only building towers on the more vulnerable north-eastern and far western sectors. The towers were probably used to mount artillery weapons such as catapults and heavy crossbows.Goodall, p. 13 Ten towers still survive, though there may originally have been more before the loss of the south wall.Fields, p. 35 Gates Roman west gate of Pevensey Castle The Roman fort had two principal entrances, one on the east side and the other on the west, guarded by clusters of towers. The west gate covered the landward access via the causeway that linked Pevensey to the mainland. A ditch bisected the causeway, which led up to a rectangular gatehouse with a single arch around wide, with a D-shaped tower on each end from which archers could fire along the archway. The main entrance of the Saxon Shore fort at Portchester, built around the same period, had a very similar plan. Nothing now remains of the Roman gatehouse, which was replaced during medieval times, while only a few stones are left of the medieval gatehouse. The east gate, wide, still stands; although what is visible now is principally medieval and 19th century, the Roman original probably did not look much different. A postern gate was set into the north wall next to a section that has now collapsed. It was originally constructed in the form of a narrow curved passageway. Another postern gate may have been set into the collapsed south wall. These suggest that there may have been routes into the fort from across the marshes or access from a harbour, of which no trace remains. Interior The interior of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, to bring it up to the level of the projecting step on the back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks.Goodall, p. 14‚Äì15 The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.Lyne, p. 38 =Inner bailey= Aerial view of Pevensey Castle's inner bailey, showing remnants of a chapel and a well. The curtain wall and moat of the inner bailey The Normans divided the interior of the old Roman fort into two fortified enclosures, referred to as the inner and outer baileys. The inner bailey of the castle was, in effect, a castle within a castle, consisting of a walled fortification with a tower at each corner, surrounded by a moat and with a keep of unusual design at its eastern extremity, adjoining the old Roman curtain wall. The present stone fortifications of the inner bailey date mainly from the 13th and 14th centuries. They replaced the original wood and earth fortifications of the Norman inner bailey, which occupied a much larger area of the Roman fort's interior. Traces of the Norman bailey's ditch and earthen rampart, which stretched right across the interior of the fort, can still be seen today. The inner bailey protected the castle's most important domestic buildings, while the outer bailey was used for buildings of lesser importance such as a granary for the manor of Pevensey.Goodall, pp. 4‚Äì5 The inner bailey's moat ‚Äì which is fed by a springLyne, p. 10 ‚Äì was probably over wide when first dug. The moat protected a mid-13th century curtain wall, which is still largely intact, that divides the inner and outer baileys. A wooden bridge around long linked the inner and outer baileys, though the cost of maintaining it prompted its replacement in 1405 with a stone causeway and drawbridge pit that can still be seen today. The principal entrance to the inner bailey was through the early 13th century gatehouse at the end of the entrance bridge, which had two D-shaped towers flanking a vaulted entrance passage. The towers were built on three levels with arrow slits in each level and basements below, which have survived intact. One of the basements can be reached via a spiral staircase; the other can only be accessed through a hole in the tower's floor and may have been used as a prison cell or oubliette. The gatehouse towers were built with open backs, which were probably closed by a wooden wall.Goodall, pp. 6‚Äì7 Three other towers still stand on the east, north and south sides of the inner bailey's curtain wall. Built in the mid-13th century, they each had three floors which were accessed through separate entrances on each level. Lighting was provided by arrow-slits, and the upper room in each tower, which was the only one to have a fireplace, was probably used as a lodging area. A latrine was also provided. Only the north tower is known to have been completed; however, its vaulted basement was mostly destroyed around 1317 when the roof and floors of the tower collapsed into it. It is not clear whether the south and east towers were ever completed. An estimate written in 1317 reveals that the towers were thatched, lacking castellations and a proper lead roof, but it is not known whether the work itemised in the estimate was ever carried out. The interiors of the towers were substantially modified in 1940.Goodall, p. 11 Samuel and Nathaniel Buck's depiction of the ruined castle in 1737 The interior of the inner bailey is now a broad, grassy area dominated by the stump of the keep at its eastern edge, which survives only up to its first floor. Despite the massive nature of the ruins, they preserve little of the original design apart from its unique ground plan. It consisted of a rectangular block measuring about by internally with seven projecting towers, a design found in no other medieval castle. Nothing remains of the interior and the uniqueness of its design makes it difficult to reconstruct its internal layout. Surviving 14th century documents record that it contained a kitchen and a chapel, and had an iron door at its main entrance which was approached up a wooden stair.Goodall, pp. 7‚Äì9 Like most Norman keeps, the entrance was situated on the first floor; the ground floor lacks any openings and it appears to have been constructed as a solid mass of masonry filled with clay. The near-total destruction of everything above the first floor means that the keep's original height is unknown, but it may have stood to a height of about or so.Peers, p. 10 The keep underwent at least two redesigns in the first half of the 14th century, possibly prompted by damage inflicted in earlier sieges. One of the redesigns involved constructing an adjoining square tower which some have suggested could have been used to mount a catapult; large stone balls, used as catapult ammunition, can still be seen in the inner bailey today. The building was recorded to be dilapidated for much of the 14th century despite repeated repairs, and had fallen into ruin by the 16th century. It was subjected to systematic stone-robbing for centuries; as early as 1591, it was recorded that all the best stones had been \\"imbeselled and carried away\\" and that one family had removed no fewer than 677 cartloads of ashlar facing-stone from the keep's walls. A late 18th century engraving shows the remains of the building in a state of collapse and it had completely collapsed by the 1880s.Fulford & Rippon, p. 130 The ruins were largely buried under a great heap of earth and clay that had been deposited sometime in the late medieval or early modern periods, which was not removed until the 1920s. The reason for the construction of this mound over the ruined keep is unclear, but it may have been related to the brief Elizabethan use of the castle as a gun position. A number of other buildings once stood in the inner bailey, though only traces now remain. The interior of the curtain wall was lined with timber-framed domestic buildings such as the great hall, which appears to have been totally rebuilt by Edward I in 1301‚Äì02 and possibly on other occasions. The arrangement of these buildings is not known but remains of the fireplaces can still be seen built into the curtain wall. Due to the relatively small space available in the inner bailey, the buildings would have been very narrow.Goodall, p. 10 The stone foundations of a small chapel are also visible in the inner bailey. The chapel was first documented in the 13th century and was rebuilt in 1302, either on the existing stone foundations or in the outer bailey in a new location. The castle's water supply was provided by a well situated beside the chapel. It has never been fully dug out, but investigations have revealed that it is lined with stone to a depth of around and with wood beyond that.Goodall, p. 12 History Roman fort The nine British Saxon Shore forts in the Notitia Dignitatum. Pevensey Castle or Anderitum is the third one on the third row down. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Pevensey Castle was established as one of the nine Late Roman forts on the British side of the Saxon Shore (Latin: Litus Saxonicum). The fort is named as Anderitum, apparently meaning \\"great ford\\", in the Notitia Dignitatum, a list of Roman \\"dignities\\" (i.e. public offices) as of the 5th century. (An alternative spelling of Anderida or Anderita has also been proposed, but is disfavoured.)Wilson, p. 54‚Äì55 The fort was long thought to have been built in the mid-4th century but it has been dated to around 290, based on the dating of wooden piles which were found underpinning the Roman walls in an excavation carried out in 1994. Other Saxon Shore forts were built or reconstructed around this time as part of a systematic programme of improvements to the coastal defences of Roman Britain. The construction of the Saxon Shore forts has been linked to the raids that Saxon and Jute pirates (from what is now northern Germany and mainland Denmark) were mounting against communities along the North Sea and English Channel. An alternative explanation is that Anderitum was built to defend Roman Britain from Rome itself. Carausius, a Roman general who commanded the Classis Britannica (the Roman fleet based in the English Channel), revolted against Rome in 286 and declared himself emperor of Britain and northern Gaul. He was assassinated in 293 by his treasurer, Allectus, who was himself killed in 296 when the Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus invaded Britain to overthrow the usurper. Coins of both Carausius and Allectus have been discovered buried in the foundations of the fort's walls. A later coin of 330‚Äì335 was found under a tower in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a major repair or reconstruction around that time. The usurpers had inherited an existing system of coastal defence ‚Äì the earlier Saxon Shore forts ‚Äì and may have decided to augment it with the construction of Pevensey Castle and its close contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle).Fields, p. 43 Anderitum appears to have been a particularly important link in the Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted in coordination with naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through the Channel. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to control access to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland.Goodall, p. 19 It was linked by a road built in the late Roman period, probably at the same time as the fort. =Construction= It is not known how long it took for Anderitum to be constructed, but it has been estimated that it took around 160,000 man- days to complete, equivalent to 285 men spending two years building it or 115 men over five years. At least four gangs of builders appear to have worked on the surviving sections of walls; each gang was given a stretch of about at a time to build but executed the work in significantly different styles, for instance using differing numbers of tiled bonding-courses or ironstone facing in particular places. This may simply indicate varying levels of availability of construction materials at the time each segment was built, leading the gangs to use whatever supplies were available at that moment.Johnson (1976), p. 58 The amount of construction material required was very large, equating to about of stone and mortar. It is not known how it was transported to the site, but that volume of material would have needed some 600 boat loads or 49,000 wagon loads, requiring 250 wagons pulled by 1,500‚Äì2,000 oxen to move it from the quarries to Pevensey. Given the scale of the requirements for land transportation, it seems more likely that the raw materials were instead moved by sea, though even this would have been a significant operation; it has been estimated that 18 vessels would have been needed for a continuous supply operation carried out over a season of 280 days.Pearson, p. 94‚Äì5 The curtain wall was not all built at once but was constructed in segments, as can be seen from vertical breaks in the stonework which mark where sections met. The wall is built on top of complex foundations constructed from rubble and timber set into a ditch deep. Oak piles were driven into the trench and packed with flint and clay, above which a horizontal framework of oak beams was set with more flint and clay. The foundation was finally covered over with cement before the walls were built on top.Goodall, p. 16 Some of the timbers have survived, allowing archaeologists to date the fort through dendochronology.Goodall, p. 17 Other dating evidence was discredited in the 1970s. An excavation in 1906‚Äì08 found shattered tiles stamped HON AUG ANDRIA, which were used to attribute Pevensey Castle's construction to the reign of the early 5th-century Emperor Honorius. However, the use of thermoluminescence dating revealed that the tiles had been made around the time of the excavation. It is suspected that Charles Dawson, who has been blamed for the Piltdown Man hoax, was the author of the forged tiles.Johnson (1976), pp. 144‚Äì5 =Garrison= Anderitum is recorded in the Notitia Dignitatum as the base of the praepositus numeri Abulcorum ‚Äì an infantry unit or numerus of the limitanei or border forces. It also mentions army and naval units bearing the fort's name in connection with the Vicus Julius, in the Roman army in Gaul and stationed at Lutetia (modern Paris). This suggests that by the time the Notitia was written, the original garrison had been moved to Gaul and replaced with the numerus Abulcorum. The Abulci are mentioned in connection with the field army in Gaul and in the suppression of the rebellion of Magnentius in Pannonia Secunda in 351. It is not known whether their name is a geographical or functional one but their description by Zosimus suggests that they were an elite body of troops, who served both in the field army and, probably in the form of a single detachment, at Anderitum.Johnson (1976), p. 70 They may have been foederati, troops raised from allied barbarian tribes and put under the command of a Roman prefect, or perhaps even a single band of warriors with their own leader. Similar numeri were recorded in the Notitia Dignitata as being stationed in other Saxon Shore forts.Fields, p. 50 Abandonment and post-Roman use Unlike at many other Roman forts, no civilian settlement or vicus appears to have been established outside the walls of Pevensey Castle; this was probably because the fort was at the end of a peninsula with limited room for additional construction.Fields, p. 53 When the Roman army retreated from Britain in 410, civilians appear to have moved into the abandoned fort, perhaps for protection against Saxon raiders, and its name continued to be used well into the Saxon period. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in 477 a Saxon raid drove local people into the forest of Andreadsleag (which from another reference seems to have stretched over from the mouth of the River Lympne to Hampshire). Although the history of the fort at this time is unrecorded, archaeological evidence indicates that its inhabitants had wide- ranging trade links that enabled them to import wares from as far afield as Macedonia and Syria. They may have exported timber and iron from the Sussex Weald to pay for such costly goods.Lyne, p. 41 In 491, the Chronicle records that the Saxons Aelle and Cissa \\"besieged Andredadsceaster and slew all the inhabitants; there was not even one Briton left there.\\" It is uncertain whether habitation of the fort continued after this event,Goodall, pp. 18‚Äì19 which is now thought to have happened around 471 rather than the date recorded by the Chronicle (due to a dating error by Gildas, on whose work the Chronicle draws). The fort appears to have been resettled by about the middle of the 6th century by a Saxon community which left evidence of its occupation in the shape of pottery, glass and other items. By the late Anglo-Saxon period, Pevensey had become a well-established fishing port and producer of salt.Lyne, p. 1 Whereas the modern village of Pevensey is situated entirely outside the walls, the 11th century village appears to have been situated within the Roman walls.Lyne, p. 42 At the time of the Norman Conquest it had a population of 52 burgesses with a harbour and saltworks outside the walls.Rowley, p. 127 A civilian settlement within the castle walls evidently persisted for some considerable time after the Conquest, as a licence of 1250 refers to the Roman fortress as the \\"outer wall of the town\\".Peers, p. 5 Norman period and after William the Conqueror's army building a castle at Hestengaceastra ‚Äì possibly Pevensey Castle? Anderitum had fallen into ruin by the time of the Norman conquest of England but it still remained a formidable fortification in a very strategic location, offering a natural anchorage near one of the narrowest points of the English Channel. By this time the locality was known as Pevensey, meaning \\"River of [a man named] Pefen\\" (deriving from the Anglo- Saxon personal name Pefen plus e√£, \\"river\\", presumably a reference to the now largely silted-up Pevensey Haven).Mills, p. 367 When William the Conqueror launched his invasion of England by landing at Pevensey Bay on 28 September 1066, his army sheltered for the night in a temporary fortification situated within the old Roman fort. The Normans dug a ditch across the causeway linking the fort with the mainland and made repairs to the Roman walls to strengthen them. The army left for Hastings the following day, en route to the Battle of Hastings.Goodall, p. 20 The Bayeux Tapestry depicts WIlliam's army constructing a castle at \\"Hestengaceastra\\", a Latinised rendition of the Saxon placename Haestingaceaster. As placenames with the suffix - ceastre were almost always associated with Roman forts (compare Manchester, Lancaster, Doncaster etc.) and no Roman fort is known to have existed at the modern site of Hastings, it has been suggested that the name actually refers to Anderitum ‚Äì in which case the depiction in the Tapestry may show the construction of the temporary Norman castle within the Roman fortress walls.Rowley, p. 74 William's choice of Pevensey as a defensive location may not have been entirely due to practical military reasons. It also had political connotations, implying that the Normans were on a level with the Romans. He followed a similar pattern elsewhere in England, building the Tower of London alongside the still-extant Roman city wall and constructing Colchester Castle on top of the ruins of the Temple of Claudius.Hull, pp. 14‚Äì15 Following William's victory at Hastings, the county of Sussex came to be seen by the new regime as being of essential military value. It was both a frontier zone and an essential link between England and Normandy. The existing tenurial arrangements in the county were swept away and replaced by five subdivisions, or rapes, each of which was given to one of William's most important followers. Each rape was associated with a major castle, Pevensey being one of them.Huscroft, p. 242 In 1067 William left England for Normandy via Pevensey. He also appears to have used the site to distribute lands to his Norman followers, with Pevensey Castle and the surrounding Rape of Penvensey being gifted to his half-brother Robert, Count of Mortain. Section of the Roman east wall of Pevensey Castle showing Norman repairs (the herringbone-style stonework) William's temporary fortification within the Roman walls was expanded to create a permanent Norman castle at Pevensey, probably during Robert's tenure sometime in the 1070s. The Roman walls were further repaired and two enclosures or baileys were created, divided by a ditch and a palisade constructed from timber.Goodall, p. 21 Robert also founded a small borough outside the Roman walls which was recorded as having 110 burgesses and a mint by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086. This may have been the original site of the modern village of Pevensey, but it is equally possible that Robert's borough may have been the foundation site of the village of Westham to the west of the castle, whose layout has many similarities to that of other Norman new towns.Fulford & Rippon, p. 125Rowley, pp. 127‚Äì8 The Norman castle's defences were put to the test for the first time in the Rebellion of 1088, when Norman barons allied with Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy rebelled against the new king William Rufus. The barons, who were also supported by William the Conqueror's half-brothers Robert of Mortain and Bishop Odo of Bayeux, defended Pevensey Castle against an army led personally by William Rufus. Although the castle's defences were strong enough to resist assaults from land and sea, its defenders were forced to surrender when they ran out of food after six weeks. Robert was allowed to keep the castle but his son William, Count of Mortain was stripped of it, along with his other English estates, after rebelling against Henry I in the early 12th century.Goodall, p. 22 Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but continued to use it for his own purposes, as happened in 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing the rest of their possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release but as soon as he was freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved impervious to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.Davis, p. 95 Later medieval use The stump of the 13th century keep of Pevensey Castle Gilbert's disloyalty led to the Crown seizing the castle again and taking on the burden of repairing and maintaining it. The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into the development of the castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus earthworks and timber palisades. They were maintained in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that required them to repair and keep up sections of the palisades.Pounds, p. 204 Pevensey Castle appears to have acquired its first major new stone buildings in the 1190s. Their construction may be indicated by a series of substantial payments for works at the castle during the reign of Richard I. The keep and gatehouse may have been constructed under Richard, though mentions from 1130 of \\"the Tower of Pevensey\\" suggest that there may have been an earlier stone building on the site, or that the keep was constructed at this earlier date. Whenever it was built, it was probably destroyed by about 1216 when Richard's successor John fought off an invasion led by Prince Louis of France. The French invasion during the First Barons' War forced John to order the slighting of Pevensey Castle, as he did not have enough men to garrison it and could not afford it to fall into French hands. A subsequent rebuilding saw the timber palisades of the inner bailey replaced by stone walls and towers. Exactly when this happened is unclear, but it may have been under Peter of Savoy, the Earl of Richmond, who was granted the castle by Henry III in 1246. There is no record of the rebuilding but in 1254 Peter ended the feudal requirement to maintain the palisades and replaced it with cash payments.Goodall, p. 23 This probably reflected the replacement of the palisades with the stone walls and towers visible today. The castle faced a lengthy siege only a decade later during the Second Barons' War from the rebel baron Simon de Montfort, following Henry's defeat in the Battle of Lewes. Defeated members of the royalist army fled to Pevensey, pursued by de Montford's forces, but the garrison refused an invitation to surrender and endured over a year of besiegement. Their adversaries were unable to stop supplies reaching the castle despite digging a ditch to cut it off from the mainland; its garrison raided the surrounding countryside and sought to obtain fresh supplies of men and weapons by sea in December 1264. The costly and ineffective siege was eventually lifted in July 1265. It caused significant damage to the castle, with the Roman wall toppled on the south side. The parish churches at Pevensey and Westham also suffered damage, which the attackers may have caused in using them as siege castles (temporary fortresses and artillery platforms).Goodall, p. 24 Peter continued to control Pevensey Castle after de Montford's defeat and death at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265. It became Crown property after Peter's death, when Henry III's queen Eleanor of Provence acquired the castle. It remained with the Crown for another century under the control of several queens consort, including Edward II's wife Isabella and Edward III's wife Philippa, who were responsible for appointing the castle's Constables.Peers, p. 4 By this time, the silting of Pevensey Bay was evidently having an effect on the garrison's ability to resupply via the sea. Accounts from 1288 indicate that seaborne access was becoming increasingly difficult, causing problems in unloading goods.Creighton, p. 44 However, it continued to play a significant role in the defence of the south coast against French raids and was occupied through much of the 14th century by a garrison consisting of between twenty and thirty men. These usually comprised ten men-at-arms, twenty archers and a watchman, who were supplied with provisions and armour. The Duke of Lancaster, John of Gaunt, refused to garrison it in 1377 five years after he took possession of the castle, asserting that he was wealthy enough to rebuild it if a French attack destroyed it. His actions attracted public hostility which culminated during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 when a mob attacked the castle, burnt its court rolls and abused the steward.Goodall, p. 25 Catapult or trebuchet ammunition at Pevensey Castle The castle underwent repeated repair work during the 14th century, though poor maintenance and corruption appears to have caused its fabric to deteriorate rapidly. The main buildings of the inner bailey were totally reconstructed in 1301 but were reported to be in a ruinous condition only five years later. The castle's constable, Roger de Levelande, was accused of illicitly asset-stripping the castle by breaking up and selling the wooden bridge that connected it to the mainland. Some \\"wardens\\" were also accused of burning the timbers of a disused barn. It was estimated that the resulting damage and the ongoing structural deterioration to the curtain wall would cost over ¬£1,000 to repair. Around 1325, the keep was partly demolished and rebuilt. It is possible that by this time the Roman curtain wall was in such a poor state that it was no longer considered part of the castle defences. Various late 13th and early 14th century records describe how sections of the wall had fallen down or been destroyed in sieges. The collapse of the wall on the north-west side is thought to have occurred by no later than the middle of the 13th century, and this event may have made the outer bailey indefensible thereafter. Pevensey Castle was besieged again for the fourth and last time in its history in 1399. By this time it was controlled by Sir John Pelham, one of Gaunt's retainers, who had been appointed to the Constableship in 1394. Pelham supported Gaunt's son, Henry Bolingbroke ‚Äì the later Henry IV ‚Äì in his rebellion against Richard II. The king's forces besieged the castle, trapping Pelham and the garrison inside.Goodall, p. 26 In a letter sent to Bolingbroke, Pelham wrote: The siege failed, Bolingbroke was crowned and the new king granted the Castle and Honour of Pevensey to Pelham as a reward for his loyalty. The Lancastrian kings subsequently used the castle as a prison for high-ranking nobles. Its inmates included King James I of Scotland, who was captured while en route to France in 1405, and Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, who was held at Pevensey after becoming involved in a plot against Henry IV. On his death, Edward bestowed ¬£20 in his will to Thomas Playsted, apparently one of his jailers, \\"for the kindness he showed me when I was in ward at Pevensey.\\"Ward, p. 8 Henry IV's second wife Joan of Navarre was imprisoned by Joan's stepson Henry V on charges of plotting to kill him through witchcraft; she was held at Pevensey between December 1419 and March 1420 before being moved to Leeds Castle and eventually released in 1422. When the Tudor dynasty took over the castle was abandoned, and by 1573 it was recorded to be in ruins.Goodall, p. 27 Usage in the modern period Elizabethan cannon at Pevensey Castle, mounted on a replica carriage Second World War machine-gun post incorporated into Pevensey Castle's east wall Elizabeth I ordered the castle's remains to be \\"utterlye raysed\\", but her order was not enforced and it remained standing.Quinn, p. 61 In 1587, the castle was reoccupied ‚Äì though not rebuilt ‚Äì to serve as a gun position against the threat of a Spanish invasion. A U-shaped earth emplacement was built in the outer bailey, facing south over the collapsed section of the Roman wall. Two iron demi-culverin cannons were installed and were in place at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, although the Armada failed and they were never used in anger. One of the guns, marked with a Tudor rose and the initials E.R. (Elizabeth Regina), has been preserved and can be seen in the inner bailey of the castle mounted on a replica carriage. Although the cannon was recorded at the time as being only \\"of small value\\"Peers, p. 6 it is now one of only a few cast-iron cannons to have survived from the Elizabethan period.Lister, p. 66 It was almost certainly manufactured locally in the Sussex Weald. Pevensey Castle remained abandoned and crumbling from the end of the 16th century to the first quarter of the 20th. It was nearly demolished during the period of the English Commonwealth in the 17th century when Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentary Commissioners sold it for ¬£40 to a builder, John Warr of Westminster, who planned to quarry it for its stones. Very little work took place, however, and the Crown reacquired the castle in 1660.King, p. 328 It was restored to the possession of the Pelham family, until in 1730 the Duke of Newcastle resigned it to Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington. It was subsequently acquired by the House of Cavendish.Howard, p. 134 In 1925 its last private owner, the 9th Duke of Devonshire, gave the castle to the state as a historic monument and it underwent repairs and some reconstruction under the supervision of the Ministry of Works.Goodall, p. 28 It acquired a fresh military significance in 1940 when Pevensey's exposed shoreline and flat hinterland became a possible target area for a German invasion after the fall of France. It was reoccupied by the military for the first time in over 400 years, with British and Canadian troops garrisoning it from May 1940, and Americans later. The towers of the inner bailey were converted into troop accommodation by lining the walls with bricks and laying wooden floors. New perimeter defences were constructed; machine-gun posts were built into the walls, disguised to look like part of the original structure, and an anti-tank blockhouse was built in the entrance of the Roman west gate. The main and postern gates of the inner bailey were blocked by concrete and brick walls, and anti-tank cubes were installed along the areas where the Roman curtain wall had collapsed. The main concern was that an invader could have captured the castle and used its interior as a strongpoint. It was intended that the new defensive measures at the castle would make it \\"100% tank-proof\\" and that an enemy would not be able to approach within of it.Farebrother, p. 22 The United States Army Air Corps also used it as a radio direction centre from early 1944. In 1945 the castle was returned to civilian control. The blockhouse and obstructions were demolished but it was decided to leave the machine-gun posts in place to illustrate the most recent chapter in the castle's history. The castle is now managed by English Heritage and is open to the public. Excavations Pevensey Castle has been the subject of a number of excavations and archaeological investigations over the past 300 years. The first recorded excavation on the site took place in 1710, when the vicar of Pevensey sought to dig a channel from the castle's moat, within the outer bailey, to convey water to the village. The project necessitated digging under the Roman curtain wall. This revealed how the wall had been constructed, resting on a foundation of rubble-packed oak piles and beams which were described as exhibiting \\"no symptoms of decay, and even the leaves of some brushwood which had been thrown in were found equally well preserved.\\"Lower, p. 6 The Sussex Archaeological Society, now the oldest archaeological society in England, was founded within the castle's walls on 9 July 1846.Lower, p. 1 Six years later, two antiquarians, Mark Antony Lower and Charles Roach Smith, were granted permission by the Duke of Devonshire to carry out an excavation of the castle with the support of sponsors and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, which provided free transport.Lower, p. 12 The excavations concentrated on the Roman west gate and north postern, with some small trial trenches dug elsewhere on the site. They began in August 1852 and continued until November, unearthing several 4th century Roman coins, numerous stone catapult balls and the foundations of the chapel in the inner bailey.Lower, p. 18 The castle well was also discovered around the same time by the castle's custodian.Lower, p. 19 Further excavations were carried out by Louis Salzmann between 1906 and 1908, concentrating on the north-west sector of the Roman fort, the east gate and the north postern. Harry Sands undertook the clearing of debris around the medieval castle keep in 1906 and more extensive excavations in 1910. Further clearing work took place under the supervision of the Ministry of Works in 1926 following the acquisition of the castle by the state. In 1936 Frank Cottrill carried out an eight-month excavation in the area of the outer bailey. B. W. Pearce excavated outside the Roman west gate in 1938 and cleared the moat of debris the following year. The Second World War ended any further work, and it was not until 1964 that limited exploration by Stuart Rigold took place outside the south-east postern of the inner bailey. In 1993‚Äì95, a team from the University of Reading led by Professor Michael Fulford carried out a series of excavations in the area of the keep and on the Roman fortress's east side.

The group consists of 6 male members; Kazuki ≈åtake and Masakazu Mimura of Summers, Red Yoshida and Golgo Matsumoto of TIM, Ry≈ç Fukawa, and the leader of the group, the eminent Japanese comedian Teruyoshi Uchimura. History The origin of the group's name traces back to one of their first television appearances on the popular music show, Music Station in 2003. Having arrived to sing a song, but not having prepared any lyrics, a fellow guest--Morning Musume's Mari Yaguchi--commented on-air, \\"No plan, huh?\\", and the name stuck. Their first album was then named We are NO PLAN. In 2004, NO PLAN was selected to perform the title song to the new Crayon Shin-chan movie, and they also managed to land their first live appearance. Although they released another single, Oh! Summer, and a new album, SUMMER PLAN, in 2005, their main TV outlet Uchimura Produce was cancelled on September 26, 2005. Not long after the show was cancelled, NO PLAN released a third album, LAST PLAN, and though the members continue to appear as NO PLAN on many variety shows, and on the occasional Uchimura Produce special, the comedians generally appear alone or in their own kombi.

In it had a population of . History An Arab village named Kerkur had stood at this location by the time the Palestine Exploration Fund had compiled its first maps in 1878. In 1913, 15 square kilometers of land was purchased by the Hachsharat Hayishuv society from Arabs in Jenin and Haifa for 400,000 francs (a sum equivalent to 2 million US dollars).Pardes Hanna-Karkur, A General Real Estate Overview Two years later, the land was sold to a private investor, Yitzhak Shlezinger, the Odessa Committee and the First London Ahuza society. This land became the core of Karkur, Moshav Gan Hashomron and Kibbutz Ein Shemer. Until actual settlement began, the area was guarded by Hashomer, which planted eucalyptus trees to circumvent a Turkish law that allowed the Ottomans to expropriate lands if they were not cultivated for three years. The early settlements did not fare well. Shlezinger went bankrupt and sold his land to the Jewish National Fund. The London Ahuza society hoped to settle English Jews on the land, but succeeded only partially. Eventually the Jewish National Fund and the London Ahuza society joined forces to establish Karkur. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Karkur had a population of 38 inhabitants, consisting of 35 Jews and 3 Muslims. By 1931, Karkur has grown to 189 houses, with an overwhelming Muslim majority (282 Jews and 564 Muslims);https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas yet by 1945, all Muslims had left, and its population was recorded as 2380, all Jews.http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VillageStatistics1945orig.pdf Pardes Hanna (lit. \\"Hanna's orchard\\", also \\"Pardes Chana\\") was founded in 1929 by Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association and named after Hannah Rothschild, daughter of Nathan Mayer Rothschild. On 6 April 1948, the Irgun raided the British Army camp at Pardes Hanna, killing seven British soldiers and stealing a large quantity of weapons.The Scotsman: 17, 18 April. Yaakov Meridor was reported to have been in command of the Irgun attackers. Those dead included Lieut-Colonel G.L. Hildebrand, Royal Artillery After Israeli independence, Neve Efraim was founded by Jewish immigrants from Yemen and Neve Oved was established by the Labor movement. In addition, many Jews from Mumbai, India, including Jews from Bahrain who fled to Israel via Mumbai, settled there. In the 1950s, the villages Tel Shalom and Neve Efraim were merged with Pardes Hanna. Pardes Hanna and Karkur merged in 1969.

The land area is 22,596 dunams (~). Pardes-Hanna is governed by the largest local council in Israel by population size (among towns without municipal status). Education The oldest and largest school in Pardes Hanna-Karkur is the Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School. It was established in 1934 by the Association of Farmers and was the first agricultural school to include a full academic matriculation program as part of its curriculum. Pardes Hanna-Karkur has six non-religious elementary schools, including a Democratic school, and four religious elementary schools, as well as the Rimon Waldorf School. A religious high-school for boys, Midrashiat Noam, was once considered the flagship of religious-Zionist education. Its graduates include former ministers Yitzhak Peretz, Benny Elon and Ya'akov Ne'eman; journalists Haim Zisowitz, Yair Sheleg and Adam Baruch; and Labor Party Secretary-General Eitan Cabel.An educator's legacy A religious high school for girls, Elisheva, is also located in Pardes Hanna. Transportation Pardes Hanna-Karkur is served by the Caesarea-Pardes Hanna Railway Station and by buses run by Egged and Kavim.

It is most popular for water recreation and camping. However the park also contains historical resources related to the Dakota War of 1862, including an original log cabin and a monument to 15 white settlers killed there and at nearby Slaughter Slough on August 20, 1862. The park and lake were developed by the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Two districts of park structures built in the National Park Service rustic style are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Lake Shetek State Park occupies on the east shore of Lake Shetek in northeastern Murray County, outside the town of Currie. The park is about equidistant from both Tracy to the north and Slayton to the southwest, and southeast of the city of Marshall. Almost of shoreline on Lake Shetek lie within the park boundary, though inholdings with private homes comprise some of that distance. The park includes Loon Island, which is connected to the mainland by a causeway. Two smaller lakes, two fish rearing ponds, and two marshes are also within the park boundaries. The park lies on the Coteau des Prairies, a plateau at the juncture of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa. Southwest of the drainage basin of the Des Moines River there are no natural lakes for some distance. For this reason the state park attracts many visitors from neighboring parts of Iowa and South Dakota. Natural history Geology Lake Shetek and the surrounding landscape of wetlands and rolling hills are the result of glaciation. The lake and park lie on the Altamont Moraine, a terminal moraine marking the farthest extent of an ice lobe during the Wisconsin glaciation. This most-recent glaciation deposited a very thick blanket of till over the area. A well just outside the park was drilled through of till without reaching bedrock. Lake Shetek began forming as the climate started to warm 15,000 years ago. Water from the melting glaciers carved channels into the moraine. Where one channel‚Äînow occupied by Beaver Creek‚Äîintersected the channel now occupied by the Des Moines River, a buildup of sediment and slumping banks partially dammed the outflow, creating a large, shallow lake. Flora Prior to European cultivation, most of the future park was prairie. Settlers recorded that the only trees were on Lake Shetek's islands, which were protected from wildfires. They were not protected from the settlers, however, and were soon harvested. Ecological succession has converted the old fields mostly to northern hardwood forest composed of oak, hackberry, basswood, elm, and ash trees. Restoration ecology efforts are being made to return park grasslands to native prairie. The secondary forest on Loon Island was heavily impacted in the 1970s when Dutch elm disease decimated the American and red elms. The mossy trunks and stumps of dead elms still litter the island, providing shelter and nutrients to the ecosystem. Fauna Mammals found in the park include white-tailed deer, foxes, minks, beavers, fox squirrels, muskrats, groundhogs, and coyotes. The park's combination of lake, woods, and marshes at the head of the Des Moines River flyway attracts a wide variety of bird life. Waterfowl include ducks, herons, coots, grebes, and white pelicans, and many species breed in the area. Among the woodland birds are flycatchers, sparrows, thrushes, vireos, many species of warbler, and blue-gray gnatcatchers. Marsh birds include lesser yellowlegs, spotted sandpipers, Wilson's snipes, and upland sandpipers. The park's two major geographic features are both named after birds. \\"Shetek\\" is derived from the Ojibwe language word for pelican. Loon Island is a misnomer, however; the large diving birds seen by the pioneers were double-crested cormorants, not common loons. In the 1910s locals blamed the cormorants for depleting Lake Shetek's fish population and organized a hunt to extirpate them. Due to the hunt and ongoing human disturbance, the species is only seen on Lake Shetek during migration and no longer breeds there. None of the park's small lakes or marshes support a year-round fish population. Cultural history The earliest humans around Lake Shetek were likely following the bison that came there to drink. Archaeologists identify the first permanent inhabitants as members of the Great Oasis culture. Two burial mounds were identified in a 1973 archaeological survey. By the beginning of the historical period, the area was in the territory of the Dakota people. White explorers documented the area in the 1830s and 40s: George Catlin, Joseph Nicollet, Philander Prescott, and John C. Fr√©mont. The first settler arrived on the east shore of Lake Shetek in 1856. Lake Shetek Massacre The restored and relocated 1859 Koch Cabin By 1862 about half a dozen families had formed a small settlement along the eastern shore of Lake Shetek, totaling perhaps 40 adults and children. At least four cabins were located within the current park boundaries, at the time the very edge of the frontier. The growing Euro- American population, however, was making it increasingly difficult for the native Dakota people to pursue their traditional lifestyle. Resettlement on reservations, treaty violations by the United States, and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota. On August 20, 1862, two bands of Dakota led by Lean Grizzly Bear and White Lodge swept through the settlement, killing two men while letting the others flee. The settlers gathered at the southernmost cabin, where the leader of a third band, Old Pawn, offered them escape if they left behind their belongings for the other Dakota to loot. The whites headed east but the angry Dakota soon appeared and fired on the group. John Eastlick shot and killed Lean Grizzly Bear, and the settlers took cover in a slough. The Dakota fired into the slough over several hours, killing John Eastlick and others and wounding many more. Old Pawn promised safety to the women and children, but violence erupted again as they emerged from the slough and several were killed while others were taken captive. Ultimately 15 settlers from six families were killed. 21 settlers lived through the attack at the slough and made their way across the prairie to safety. Three women and eight or nine children were captured and taken west. That November the surviving eight captives were ransomed from White Lodge's band by a group of young pacifist Lakota and eventually reunited with their families. Two months after the attack a military burial detail interred the victims in a temporary mass grave near the slough. A year later the remains were reburied closer to the lake, where they still lie. White settlers largely abandoned the war zone for the next four decades. In 1905 and again in 1921 the Minnesota Legislature earmarked money for a monument on the site, but Murray County officials did not take action. Finally, with the backing of state senator Louis P. Johnson, a government- funded monument was erected over the gravesite. The granite pillar was dedicated on August 3, 1925. Since the monument was surrounded by private property, four years later Johnson initiated legislation that declared a state park around the site. In the following decades the original Koch family home was used as a vacation cabin on the grounds of the Tepeeotah Resort, before being donated to the county in 1960. It was moved into the state park in 1962 on the site of the Duley Cabin. For the centennial of the massacre that year, 1,500 people were in attendance. High winds knocked over some flagpoles, injuring an Eastlick descendant. A state park official deadpanned in a report to the director, \\"Eastlick blood was again spilled at Lake Shetek.\\" WPA development Lake Shetek State Park truly took form in the 1930s as part of a larger project on the lake. This was one of the more ambitious New Deal projects in Minnesota funded by the federal government to combat unemployment during the Great Depression. In addition to park amenities, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) planned to build six causeways across the lake, joining a series of islands with the east and west shores. The site was selected for recreational development due to the rarity of lakes in the area and to relieve heavy use of Camden State Park away. The state acquired adjacent to the massacre memorial, including Keeley and Loon Islands in Lake Shetek. A WPA camp was established on Keeley Island in the fall of 1934, housing 200 homeless or transient men. They constructed park amenities like the entrance road, campground, picnic area, beach, and sewage system. Using local wood and stone they built structures including a beachhouse, picnic shelter, and causeways, as well as a camp called the Zuya Group Center. Their own camp on Keeley Island was, unlike most WPA camps, designed to be permanent and function as a second group camp. However, when the WPA was disbanded with the onset of World War II the last causeway, between Keeley and Loon Islands, was incomplete. Inaccessible from the rest of the park, the property on Keeley Island was sold. The WPA camp is now used by Shetek Lutheran Ministries. Although the monument site was technically made a state park in 1929, the parks director felt reauthorization was needed for the new acreage under development. At his behest Lake Shetek was included in the ten state parks authorized by the Minnesota Legislature in 1937. In 1992 two districts of surviving WPA structures in Lake Shetek State Park were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. A district on the lakeshore comprises six contributing properties: the 1938 causeway to Loon Island, 1939 beachhouse, and (all built in 1940) the beachhouse steps, kitchen shelter, sanitation building, and drinking fountains. Two buildings at the Zuya Group Center were listed in a district: the 1940 mess hall and 1941 crafts & recreation building. The hillside beachhouse and curving double staircase are particularly noteworthy. Historian David R. Benson has called it \\"one of the most attractive designs in the park system.\\" Later history Since its development, Lake Shetek State Park has expanded with additional property and features. Around 1950 the state division of fisheries installed two fish- rearing ponds from which to stock local lakes. The fisheries division later turned the ponds over to direct park management. Food plots for deer were maintained for many years because the animals were otherwise leaving the park and eating crops on neighboring fields. The Minnesota Legislature authorized expansions several times in the 1960s, though many privately owned inholdings remain within the park's statutory boundaries. A park office and entrance station was built in 1965, then converted into the current interpretive center with the construction of a new office/entrance station in 1992. In 1996 a paved loop trail joined the park to Currie. Beginning in 2010 the state added a new campground with electric and water hookups for RVs and remodeled the existing campground. The lakeside Wolf Point Campground, renamed the Oak Woods Campground, was reduced from 78 sites to 42 to provide more privacy and reduce surface runoff into Lake Shetek. Recreation Swimming area and double staircase to the beachhouse Lake Shetek State Park is a gateway to water recreation on Lake Shetek. The park provides launch facilities for motorboats and canoes, and rents out non-motorized watercraft. Portage trails provide access to two smaller lakes within the park. A swimming area lies at the foot of the beachhouse. Game fish in Lake Shetek include walleye, northern pike, perch, bullhead, crappie, and channel catfish. In winter ice fishing for crappies is popular. The park contains 70 drive-in campsites spread across three separate campgrounds. All but six sites have electrical hookups. The Oak Woods Campground also offers four camper cabins, eight cart-in sites for tenters, flush toilets, and showers. Elsewhere in the park there is a group camp accommodating up to 30 people in tents and a one more cart-in site. The park boasts of hiking trails, including a interpretive trail across the causeway and around Loon Island. A paved loop‚Äîdesignated a section of the Casey Jones State Trail‚Äîruns between the park and Currie, accommodating joggers, bicyclists, and inline skaters. In winter are open to snowmobiles. A small visitor center houses interpretive displays. The restored Koch Cabin contains period-accurate furnishings and is open to visitors during business hours. The Eastlick Marsh on the east side of the park boasts an observation deck with a spotting scope to aid in birdwatching.

He has composed several pieces of abstract music, written radio plays and novels. You could consider him a modernist along the lines of Vladimir Mayakovsky. It was an honour for me to work with him and I think the blue tone matches the abstract music on the album perfectly. √Öke died in 2000. He is greatly missed.\\" Track listing Personnel At the Gates *Anders Bj√∂rler ‚àí guitar *Jonas Bj√∂rler ‚àí bass guitar *Adrian Erlandsson ‚àí drums *Alf Svensson ‚àí guitar *Tomas Lindberg ‚àí vocals Additional personnel *Matti K√§rki ‚àí vocals on \\"Ever-Opening Flower\\" *√Öke Hodell ‚àí artwork *Noel Summerville ‚àí mastering *Eric Gunewall ‚àí photography *Tomas Skogsberg ‚àí production *Fred Estby, Lars Linden, Tomas Skogsberg ‚àí recording References Category:At the Gates albums Category:1993 albums Category:Peaceville Records albums ","title":"With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness"},{"id":"4262178","text":"Jaakobah was one of the descendants of Simeon (I Chronicles 4:36).

Calderhead played for Queen of the South Wanderers, Notts County and Lincoln City. He also represented Scotland once, in 1889. He then became a manager, working for Lincoln City (1900‚Äì1907) and Chelsea (1907‚Äì1933). Playing career Calderhead was a central defender and played for various clubs, including Dumfries team Queen of the South Wanderers (not to be confused with Queen of the South, formed in 1919). Calderhead won a Scotland cap, in a 7‚Äì0 win against Ireland at Ibrox in the British Home Championship in March 1889. This attracted Notts County. With County he played in 2 FA Cup finals.David Calderhead in the QoS Club History\\"David Calderhead\\" full career profile on www.qosfc.com The Blackburn Rovers side of Thomas Mitchell were 3‚Äì1 winners in 1891.David Calderhead in the 1891 Blackburn Rovers v Notts County FA Cup final in the profile on Jackie Oakes Calderhead got his hands on the trophy in 1894 after a 4‚Äì1 victory over Bolton Wanderers. Management career He then moved into management, taking over at Lincoln City in 1900. In leading his side to a shock replayed win over Chelsea in the first round of 1906‚Äì07 FA Cup, he impressed the west London club's board enough for them to appoint him manager later that year. Norrie Fairgray made the same move in the same year to play for Calderhead at both clubs.David Calderhead and Chelsea in the profile on Willie ferguson Calderhead was Chelsea's first full-time secretary-manager and spent almost 26 years at the club, making him the club's longest-serving manager. In his time there, the team were relegated twice, in 1909‚Äì10 and subsequently re-promoted as Second Division runners-up. He took Chelsea to their first FA Cup final, in 1915, but in a match overshadowed by the First World War they were beaten by Sheffield United 0‚Äì3 at Old Trafford. The club later reached two more semi-finals under Calderhead and were on course for a domestic double in 1919‚Äì20 but ultimately finished 3rd in the First Division and were denied in the FA Cup by Aston Villa. A second relegation ensued in 1923‚Äì24 before the side of Willie Ferguson, Tommy Law and Andy Wilson endured a succession of near misses before securing promotion in 1929‚Äì30. Calderhead was notoriously shy of the media, earning the nickname \\"The Sphinx of Stamford Bridge\\". But he was not afraid to spend headline-making transfer fees on star strikers (especially fellow Scots), bringing the likes of Hughie Gallacher, Alex Jackson and Alec Cheyne to Stamford Bridge. Despite the glamour of the squad, trophies remained elusive. 1931‚Äì32 brought a further FA Cup semi final. Tommy Lang inspired Newcastle to a 2-goal lead and despite Gallacher pulling a goal back, Newcastle progressed to the final. Calderhead holds the record at Chelsea for managing games ‚Äì 966. He left the job in June 1933 to be replaced by Leslie Knighton. Calderhead died five years after leaving Chelsea in London at the age of 73. His son, also called David, played for Chelsea while Calderhead was manager and later managed Lincoln City.

It currently has 1400 students, with a 1:17.3 Teacher: Student ratio. Admissions The school has a Catholic ethos and caters for children from all over the city and further afield. The school is co-educational, and has students aged 11‚Äì18.  History  The sisters of Notre Dame set up the school in 1855 in central Sheffield, moving to a site on Cavendish Street in 1862. In 1919, the Sisters moved their living quarters from Cavendish Street to Oakbrook House, a Victorian mansion in Ranmoor built in 1860 for Mark Firth, a steel manufacturer who became Lord Mayor of Sheffield and Master Cutler. In 1935, another secondary school was built in the grounds of Oakbrook House; in 1948 the two schools amalgamated to form a girls' grammar school, Notre Dame High School for Girls, on two sites. The grammar school was converted in 1976 to a mixed comprehensive, still on two sites. The school finally consolidated onto the Oakbrook site in 1988 when the Cavendish site was closed and subsequently demolished. Oakbrook House, which was owned by famous Sheffield steel baron Mark Firth and part of the school since 1919, is now the school's Sixth Form block and has been a listed building since 1973. The main school building is a 1930s building with many architectural features including a main hall, known as the salle, with a high vaulted ceiling. As the school has expanded other buildings have been built that complement the architecture of the site making use of local sandstone or red pantiles depending where the building fits in. The Hallam City Learning Centre which is hosted on site has distinct modern architectural merit and receives a mention in the Pevsner guide to the architecture of Sheffield. The school became an academy in August 2012. Achievements OFSTED described the school as outstanding in every way in 2005 and 2008. School Specialism It has been a Specialist Technology College since 1995 and was awarded a second specialism in 2005 in Humanities and a third as a Leading Edge school supporting a partnership of other schools. The Leading Edge specialism also includes a sub-specialism on sharing good practice with others around issues of educating able, gifted and talented pupils. Awards ICT has been a prime focus of the school; winning the 2009 Becta Excellence ICT Award for the best whole school in Yorkshire and the Humber and other awards including a national award at the Specialist Schools and Academies Conference in 2005 and again in 2007 in recognition of this work. A new environmental learning centre website has been set up and an eco- classroom has been built by the on site Hallam CLC in the school woodland area which makes use of the latest technology to enhance learning and set an example for sustainable buildings as part of the approach to the sustainable schools strategy. Academic The GCSE (A*‚ÄìC) rate in 2009 was the strongest in school's history with the 80% barrier of the number of pupils gaining 5 good GCSE being broken for the first time. The figure including English and maths was well above average for Sheffield with 70% of 5th Year (Y11) pupils attaining these grades, compared with Sheffield's average of 39.9%. It was the second highest for Sheffield in the state sector, with Silverdale School in Sheffield being the highest. In 2007, there were 280 in the sixth form, 111 of whom took A-levels, with an average point score of 84.70, compared with the average of 79.9 in England overall. Houses The school has four houses: Picardy, Compi√®gne, St Julie, Cuvilly, all having roots in places associated with St Julie Billart, the founder of the Order of Notre Dame.NDHS: St Julie There are two school inter-house competitions, the sports day and the house cup, with the latter measuring academic ability and effort of house.

An Isle of Man Post Office employee with a sheet of stamps issued in 2015 to mark the 175th anniversary of the issue of the Penny Black. The Isle of Man Post Office (), which formerly used the trading name Isle of Man Post, operates postal collection, ancillary mail services, philatelic goods and delivery services and post office counter services on the Isle of Man. History The Isle of Man's postal service was originally operated by the United Kingdom's General Post Office, with a daily postal connection with the UK since 1879. In 1966 the UK Government commenced planning to convert the General Post Office into a public corporation, and as part of this process offered each of the Crown Dependencies the opportunity to assume control of the operations of the GPO on their territories. On 18 October 1968, Tynwald decided that they did not wish to take up the offer, but provision was made in the Post Office Act 1969 nonetheless. In the Channel Islands, the authorities did accept the offer, and postal activities of the GPO were transferred in October 1969 to form Jersey Post and Guernsey Post. The GPO had not provided any telecommunications services in the Channel Islands since the 1920s. In 1972, following negotiations by Tynwald with the GPO to leave the Island's telephone system, it was agreed that the Isle of Man would, after all, take over control of the insular postal administration. As a result, the Isle of Man Post Office Authority was formed and took over the postal assets and functions of the Post Office on 5 July 1973. The monies paid for the assets of the Post Office, ¬£148,624, were recouped within the first year from the surpluses generated by the Authority. It was reconstituted as a Statutory Board and renamed the 'Isle of Man Post Office' under the Post Office Act 1993. Telecommunications Telecommunications remained the responsibility of the British Post Office until 1981, when British Telecom was created. In 1987, telecommunications were transferred to the local company Manx Telecom, which was initially a wholly owned subsidiary of BT, but became a subsidiary of O2. Stamps Stamps marked with the name of the Isle of Man were first issued in 1971; the first issue was a variant of the 'Machin' design. Since 1973 only Manx stamps have been valid on the island, and Manx stamps are not valid for postage in the UK or elsewhere. Isle of Man stamps have since become popular with philatelists. Postal rates When sending mail to the Island from elsewhere, the Isle of Man is treated as though it were part of the United Kingdom, and mail from the UK continues to be charged at Royal Mail's UK inland rates. However, postcodes were not introduced in the Isle of Man until 1993, when the Island was postcoded as the IM postcode area as an extension of the United Kingdom postcode system.Written Answer [87341], House of Commons Hansard, London, 17 December 2002, column 739W. Mail sent from the Island to the UK is flown across the Irish Sea, and enters the first- class stream of the Royal Mail for next-day delivery. The Isle of Man Post Office is a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation. Post Offices Two delivery vehicles of the Isle of Man Post Office in the Post Office yard at Peel. The Isle of Man Post Office has Crown offices at Douglas and Ramsey. There are also post offices in the other principal towns of Peel and Castletown, as well as a number of sub post offices in smaller communities.

The facility was a banked short-track oval with a cement surface. The velodrome was located near the Winnipeg Arena and Winnipeg Stadium. Notable athletes to compete here include Jocelyn Lovell. The infield was large enough to accommodate a Canadian football-sized field, and indeed, the Velodrome was an important venue for high-school football in the city. It was planned as a facility that could relieve the larger Winnipeg Stadium from the duty of hosting amateur football, which was taking a serious toll on the grass field and making it unsuitable for professional play. Following the installation of artificial turf at Winnipeg Stadium in 1987, amateur teams resumed playing in the larger facility and football activity at the Velodrome declined sharply. Starting in 1994, the Velodrome was occasionally used as a practice facility by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League on days when the Winnipeg Goldeyes were using the Stadium. By the 1990s, the facility had become functionally obsolete for competitive cycling, and its use by cyclists had all but ceased. In light of the facility's deterioration, a decision was made to build a temporary velodrome for the 1999 Pan-American Games at the Red River Exhibition Park. The Winnipeg Velodrome was demolished in 1998 and the site is now occupied by retail stores. The temporary facility built to replace the Winnipeg Velodrome was itself disassembled and sold to a group in the Netherlands shortly after the 1999 Pan-American Games, leaving Manitoba without a velodrome facility.

Life and career Born in Naples, he was the son of Giuseppe Caccioppoli (1852‚Äì1947), a surgeon, and his second wife Sofia Bakunin (1870‚Äì1956), daughter of the Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin. After earning his diploma in 1921, he enrolled in the department of engineering, but in November, 1923 changed to mathematics. Immediately after earning his laurea, in 1925, he became the assistant of Mauro Picone, who in that year was called to the University of Naples, where he remained until 1932. Picone immediately discovered Caccioppoli's gifts and pointed him towards research in mathematical analysis. In the course of the next five years, Caccioppoli published about thirty works on topics developed in the complete autonomy provided by a ministerial award for mathematics in 1931, a competition he won at the age of 27 and the chair of algebraic analysis at the University of Padova. In 1934 he returned to Naples to accept the chair in group theory; later he took the chair of superior analysis, and from 1943 onwards, the chair in mathematical analysis. In 1931 he became a correspondent member of the Academy of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of Naples, becoming an ordinary member in 1938. In 1944 he became an ordinary member of the Accademia Pontaniana, and in 1947 a correspondent member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and a national member in 1958. He was also a correspondent member of the Paduan Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts. In the years from 1947 to 1957 he directed, together with Carlo Miranda, the journal Giornale di Matematiche, founded by Giuseppe Battaglini. In 1948 he became a member of the editing committee of Annali di Matematica, and starting in 1952 he was also a member of the editing committee of Ricerche di Matematica. In 1953 the Academia dei Lincei bestowed on him the national prize of physical, mathematical, and natural sciences. He was an excellent pianist, noted as well for his nonconformist temperament. He tried out the vagrant life, and was arrested for begging. In May 1938 he gave a speech against Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, when the latter was visiting Naples. Together with his companion Sara Mancuso, he had the French national anthem played by an orchestra, after which he began to speak against fascism and Nazism in the presence of OVRA agents. He was again arrested, but his aunt, Maria Bakunin, who at the time was a professor of chemistry at the University of Naples, succeeded in having him released by convincing the authorities that her nephew was non compos mentis. Thus Caccioppoli was interned, but he continued his studies in mathematics, and playing the piano. In his last years, the disappointments of politics and his wife's desertion, together perhaps with the weakening of his mathematical vein, pushed him into alcoholism. His growing instability had sharpened his \\"strangenesses\\", to the point that the news of his suicide on May 8, 1959 by a gunshot to the head did not surprise those who knew him. He died at his home in Palazzo Cellamare. Work His most important works, out of a total of around eighty publications, relate to functional analysis and the calculus of variations. Beginning in 1930 he dedicated himself to the study of differential equations, the first to use a topological-functional approach. Proceeding in this way, in 1931 he extended the Brouwer fixed point theorem, applying the results obtained both from ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. In 1932 he introduced the general concept of inversion of functional correspondence, showing that a transformation between two Banach spaces is invertible only if it is locally invertible and if the only convergent sequences are the compact ones. Between 1933 and 1938 he applied his results to elliptic equations, establishing the majorizing limits for their solutions, generalizing the two- dimensional case of Felix Bernstein. At the same time he studied analytic functions of several complex variables, that is, analytic functions whose domain belongs to the vector space , proving in 1933 the fundamental theorem on normal families of such functions: if a family is normal with respect to every complex variable, it is also normal with respect to the set of the variables. He also proved a logarithmic residue formula for functions of two complex variables in 1949. In 1935 Caccioppoli proved the analyticity of class solutions of elliptic equations with analytic coefficients. The year 1952 saw the publication of his masterwork on the area of a surface and measure theory, the article Measure and integration of dimensionally oriented sets (Misura e integrazione degli insiemi dimensionalmente orientati, Rendiconti dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, s. VIII, v.12). The article is mainly concerned with the theory of dimensionally oriented sets; that is, an interpretation of surfaces as oriented boundaries of sets in space. Also in this paper, the family of sets approximable by polygonal domains of finite perimeter, known today as Caccioppoli sets or sets of finite perimeter, was introduced and studied. His last works, produced between 1952 and 1953, deal with a class of pseudoanalytic functions, introduced by him to extend certain properties of analytic functions. Legacy In 1992 his tormented personality inspired the plot of a film directed by Mario Martone, The Death of a Neapolitan Mathematician (Morte di un matematico napoletano), in which he was portrayed by Carlo Cecchi. An asteroid, 9934 Caccioppoli, has been named after him. Selected publications * (Volume 1) AND (Volume 2).

Navalar's birth name was Nallur Arumuga Pillai. He was born in a Tamil literary family, and became one of the Jaffna Tamils notable for reviving, reforming and reasserting the Hindu Shaivism tradition during the colonial era. As an assistant working for Peter Percival ‚Äì a Methodist Christian missionary, he helped translate the King James Bible into the Tamil language. With his knowledge of Christian theological premises, Navalar became influential in creating a period of intense religious rivalry with Christian missionaries, defending Tamils and their historic religious culture in India and Sri Lanka, preventing large-scale conversions to Christianity. He was one of the first natives to use the modern printing press to preserve the Tamil literary tradition. He defended Hindu Shaivism, calling it samaya (Observance, Religion) of \\"True Being\\" (sat, soul), and he used the same techniques to counter Christianity that Christian missionaries used against Hinduism. As part of his religious revivalism, in a manner similar to Christian mission schools, he built schools that taught secular and Hindu religious subjects. He is credited with finding and publishing original palm leaf manuscripts. He also attempted to reform Hindu Shaivism and customary practices in Sri Lanka, such as by showing Shaiva Agamas (scriptures) prohibit animal sacrifice and violence of any form. Biography Navalar was born in 1822 as Nallur Arumuga Pillai to a Hindu family in Sri Lanka. His family belonged to the Vellalar caste, which constitutes about 50% of the Tamil Hindus on the island nation. The Vellalars were traditionally not a Dvija varna ‚Äì upper three classes of Brahmin, Kshtriya or Vaishya, and their traditional occupation was of the fourth varna (Shudra) related to farming., Quote: \\"Arumuga Navalar and Jnanaprakasha Muni belonged to the Karkatta Velala class (varna), a class that Dharmasastra classified for ritual purposes as Sudra\\" (p. 40). (For the legend on how Navalar's ancestor learnt Hindu texts and became accepted as learned in the Hindu community, and a part of Shaiva monastery tradition, see pp. 41‚Äì43) Historically, the Vellalars had been a part of the elites who owned lands, were literati, patrons of temples and monasteries. At the time of Navalar's birth, they were a part of the socio-political leadership in Jaffna peninsula, a strip of land (40 by 15 miles) separated from South India by the Palk Strait. Navalar grew up in a literati Tamil Shaiva family. Navalar's home was in the town of Nallur on the Jaffna peninsula. The principal town Jaffna and the peninsula (as well as the East of Sri Lanka) were predominantly Tamil Saiva in culture distinct from that of the Sinhalese Buddhists elsewhere. It was closely linked to the Saiva culture of South India. It was also home to the Jaffna Kingdom that had patronised this culture before it was defeated by the Portuguese colonials in 1621 CE. Nallur was also the capital of the defeated kingdom. Arumugam's father Kandharpillai was a Tamil poet and provided a foundation in Tamil literature to Arumuga Navalar. His mother Sivakami was known for her devotion to supreme Saiva deity Lord Siva. Arumugam studied the Indian classical language, Sanskrit as well as Tamil grammar. Arumugam studied English in a Christian mission run school as a day student. After his studies, he was asked to stay on at the Jaffna Central College to teach English and Tamil. The missionary school principal, Peter Percival employed him to assist in the translation of the King James Bible and other Christian literature into Tamil to further their missionary reach and objectives. Navalar immersed himself in the study of the Bible as well as the Vedas, Agamas and Puranas. When he started his studies, he wondered whether Shaiva Hinduism or Christianity was the right path. After his studies, he became convinced that the Shaiva religious tradition in the Vedas and Agamas was the right path, and that the Christian path wasn't. Arumugam Navalar felt that Hindu Saivites needed a clearer understanding of their own ancient literature and religion. He continued to help the Christian missionaries but resolved to challenge the theological ideas of these missionaries, as well as launch reforms and spread the original ideas of Shaivism. Navalar left his job under Peter Percival that he had with the Weslyan Mission, although Percival offered him a higher salary to stay on. He decided not to marry and relinquished his patrimony and did not get any money from his four employed brothers. From then on till the end of his life, he and his projects were supported by those who believed in his cause. Through his weekly sermons at Hindu temples, he also attempted to reform local Tamils of all practices that did not find sanction in the Hindu Vedas and Agamas. The lecture series and its circuit continued regularly for several years and produced a Saiva revival, helping informed piety grow among many Jaffna Saivas. This was a direct tactical response to confront what he called the \\"mockery\\" of the Hindus by Christian missionaries. During this period, he continued to assist Percival to complete the translation of the Bible, as well as his study of the primary texts of both Christianity and Hinduism. When there was a conflict as to Percival's version and another competing translation, Arumugam traveled to Madras to defend Percival's version. In 1848 he founded his own school and finally parted company with Percival. Navalar believed that the Christian missionaries should be viewed as a gift from Shiva to help awaken his community to discover their own dharma path (puram) from \\"which they had departed\\" and away from the path of the \\"barbaric Europeans\\" (purappuram), states Hudson. Background information Tamil people are natives in South India and in Sri Lanka. In the early centuries of the common era, Buddhists and Jains from northern and eastern regions of India influenced South India. The Tamil Hindu literati responded with their own literature, particularly with the bhakti saints, the Nayanars and Alvars. By the 12th century CE, the Tamils had an extensive network of temples, religious literature and pilgrimage sites dedicated to Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Of these, the Shaiva samayam (religious tradition) was most influential in the Jaffna region. They held the Vedas and Agamas to be the bedrock of their beliefs. Navalar was born and raised in this background. The 18th and 19th century Tamils in India and Sri Lanka found themselves in the midst of intrusive Christian missionary activity and their polemics against Hinduism. According to D. Dennis Hudson, Tamil Saivas opposed Christian missions from the earliest days, based on indirect literary evidence. Printing press was not available to the Hindus in colonial era South Asia, and the Shaiva community used their oral tradition and handwritten notes for anti-missionary literature. Once Hindus gained access to printing presses, they mass-produced religious literature to condemn Christian propaganda in Jaffna and Chennai (then Madras) in the same way that Christian missionaries had used mass-produced literature to attack Hinduism. Arumuga Navalar was one of the first Tamils who became adept at this information war, and to undertake as his life's career the intellectual and institutional response of Saivism to Christianity in Sri Lanka and India. The 19th century Protestant missionaries from England and America in Jaffna believed that Hindu Shaivism was \\"evil\\" and in the struggle God and the Devil, they began to use publications such as The Morning Star to reveal the \\"falsity\\" of Hindu Shaivism and highlight texts such as the Skanda Purana in their schools for children. This angered the Shaiva community, who began their own efforts to counter the methods of the Christians. Response to Protestant propaganda In September 1842 two hundred Hindu men gathered at a Siva temple monastery. The group decided to open up a school to study Vedas and Agamas. The group also decided to start a press with the help of resident Eurasian Burghers. Arumugam Navalar who was part of the organisation wrote about the meeting in The Morning Star in a sympathetic tone. While Arumugam Navalar was still working under Peter Percival and translating the Bible, he published a seminal letter in The Morning Star under a pseudonym in September 1841. It was a comparative study of Christianity and Hindu Saivism and targeted the weakness in the argument Christian missionaries had used against local Hindu Saiva practices. The missionaries had attacked the idol worship and temple rituals of the local Hindu Saivas as \\"devilish\\" and of \\"no value\\". Navalar, an avid reader of the Bible as he worked to translate it into Tamil, stated that Christianity and Jesus himself were rooted in the temple rituals of the ancient Israelites and that the reverence to the icons of Christianity such as the cross was akin to Shaiva's reverence for the icons of Hinduism such as the lingam. If Christians find their churches, rites and symbols as pedagogically useful, why shouldn't Shaiva Hindus have the same human rights and religious choices, argued Navalar. His letter admonished the missionaries for misrepresenting their own religion and concluded that in effect there was no difference between Christianity and Hindu Saivism as far as idol worship and temple rituals were concerned. Circuit preaching The popular Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil in Jaffna, destroyed in the late 15th century by the Portuguese and rebuilt in 1750 was targeted by Navalar as built not according to Agamic requirements Using the preaching methods popularised by the Methodist preachers, he became a circuit preacher. His first secession was on 31 December 1847 at Vaitheeswaran Temple in Vannarpannai. It was a weekly event known as Prasangams on every Friday evening. In these secession he read from sacred texts and then preached in a manner that lay people understood. He was helped by his friend Karttikeya Aiyar of Nallur and his students from his school. The sermon topics were mostly ethical, liturgical, and theological and included the evils of adultery, drunkenness, the value of non-killing, the conduct of women, the worship of the linga, the four initiations, the importance of giving alms, of protecting cows, and the unity of God. Emphasis on Agamas In his weekly sermons, he attacked Christians and criticized the benighted practices of local Hindus. He specifically reprimanded the trustees and priests of the Nallur Kandaswami Temple in his home town because they had built the temple not according to the Agamas a century ago as well as used priests who were not initiated in the Agamas. He also opposed their worship of Vel or the weapon representing the main deity as it did not have Agamic sanction. Reformed school system The school he founded was called Saivaprakasa Vidyasala or School of Lord Siva's splendor. The school did not follow the traditional Tamil teaching system, in which each student worked on his own pace and the teacher pupil ratio was extremely low. Although this system produced stellar experts in subject matter but took too much labour and was inefficient compared to the western system used by the Missionaries. He developed his teaching methods based on the exposure he had with the Missionaries. He developed the curriculum to be able to teach 20 students at a time and included secular subject matters and English. He also wrote the basic instruction materials for different grades in Saivism. Most of his teachers were friends and acquaintances who were volunteers. This school system was duplicated later in Chidambaram in India in 1865 and it still exits. But the school system he founded in Sri Lanka was replicated and over 100 primary and secondary schools were built based on his teaching methods. This school system produced numerous students who had clearer understanding of their religion, textual foundations, rituals and theology. Navalar title As an owner of a pioneering new school with the a need for original publications in Tamil prose to teach subjects for all grades, Arumugar Navalar felt a need for a printing press. He and his colleague Sadasiva Pillai went to Madras, India in 1849 to purchase a printing press. On the way they stopped at Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam in Tanjavur, India, an important Saiva monastery. He was asked by the head of the monastery to preach. After listening to his preaching and understanding his unusual mastery of the knowledge of Agamas, the head of the monastery conferred on him the title Navalar (learned). This honorary degree from a prestigious Saiva monastery enhanced his position amongst Saivas and he was known as the Navalar since then. Literary contributions Murugan with his two wives. Arumuka Navalar published the Tirumurukarrupatai, a devotional poem dedicated to Murugan. While in India he published two texts, one was an educational tool (teachers guide) C√ºd√£mani Nikantu, a sixteenth-century lexicon of simple verses and Soundarya Lahari, a Sanskrit poem in praise of the Primeval Mother Goddess Parvati, geared towards devotion. These were the first effort at editing and printing Tamil works for Hindu Saiva students and devotees. His press was set up in a building that was donated by a merchant of Vannarpannai. It was named the Vidyaanubalana yantra sala (Preservation of Knowledge Press). The initial publications included Bala Patam (Lessons for Children) in 1850 and 1851. They were graded readers, simple in style, similar in organisation to those used in the Protestant schools. This was followed up by a third volume in 1860 and 1865. It consisted of thirty-nine advanced essays in clear prose, discussing subjects such as God, Saul, The Worship of God, Crimes against the Lord, Grace, Killing, Eating meat, Drinking liquor, Stealing, Adultery, Lying, Envy, Anger, and Gambling. These editions were in use in 2007. Other notable texts published included The Prohibition of Killing, Manual of worship of Shiva temple and The Essence of the Saiva Religion. His first major literary publication appeared in 1851, the 272-page prose version of Sekkilar's Periya Puranam, a retelling of the 12th- century hagiography of the Nayanars or Saivite saints. In 1853 he published Nakkirar's Tirumurukarrupatai, with its own commentary. It was a devotional poem to Sri Murugan. This was followed by local missionaries attacking Sri Murugan as an \\"immoral deity\\" for marrying two women. As a response Navalar published Radiant Wisdom explaining how the chronicles embody differing levels of meaning and that numerous characters in the Christian Bible, like King David, who were being claimed as examples of good conduct by the missionaries, were being depicted as having multiple wives and sexual partners themselves. He also published literature of controversial nature, in a manner similar to how Christian missionaries were, in what Navalar called as \\"mocking\\" the Hindus. He along with Centinatha Aiyar, published examples of indecent language from the Bible and published it as Disgusting Things in the Bible (Bibiliya Kutsita). In 1852, he along with Ci. Vinayakamurtti Cettiyar of Nallur, printed the Kummi Song on Wisdom of Muttukumara Kavirajar. The local Christians called for the one-sided censorship of such criticism and to shut down these printing presses. The seminal work that was geared towards stemming the tide of conversions was printed in 1854. It was a training manual for the use of Saivas in their opposition to the missionaries, titled \\"Saiva dusana parihara\\" (The Abolition of the Abuse of Saivism). A Methodist missionary, who had worked in Jaffna, described the manual thirteen years after it had appeared as: This manual was widely used in Sri Lanka and India; it was reprinted at least twice in the 19th century, and eight times by 1956.  Legacy  Arumuka Navalar Memorial hall near Nallur Kandaswamy temple, Jaffna According to D. Dennis Hudson ‚Äì a World Religions scholar,Prof. D. Dennis Hudson (1939‚Äì2007) was a Professor of World Religions at the Department of Religion, Smith College at SUNY. Navalar's legacy began in Jaffna, but spread more broadly to Sri Lanka as well as Southern India. Navalar active efforts to set up two centres of reform made him influential in the Tamil community. He started two schools, two printing presses and campaigned against Christian missionary activity in colonial-era Jaffna and Madras Presidency. He produced approximately ninety-seven Tamil publications, twenty-three were his own creations, eleven were commentaries, and forty were his editions of those works of grammar, literature, liturgy, and theology that were not previously available in print. With this recovery, editing, and publishing of ancient works, Navalar laid the foundations for the recovery of lost Tamil classics that other Tamil scholars such as U. V. Swaminatha Iyer and C.W. Thamotharampillai continued. He was the first person to deploy the prose style in the Tamil language and according to Tamil scholar Kamil Zvelebil in style it bridged the medieval to the modern. Navalar established the world's first Hindu school adapted to the modern needs that succeeded and flourished. While the school he established in Chidamharam in 1865 has survived to this day, similar schools seem to have spread only to two nearby towns. In Sri Lanka, eventually more than one hundred and fifty primary and secondary schools emerged from his work. Many of the students of these schools were successful in defending the Hindu Saiva culture not only against Christian missionary activities but also against neo-Hindu sects. His reforms and contributions were added to by scholars such as V. Kalyanasundaram (1883‚Äì1953), and Maraimalai Adigal (1876‚Äì1950), who developed their own schools of theology within the Hindu Saiva heritage. Although it is difficult to quantify as to how many Hindus may have converted to Protestant Christianity without his intervention but according to Bishop Sabapathy Kulendran, the low rate of conversion compared to the initial promise was due to Navalar's activities. Arumuka Navalar who identified himself with an idealised past, worked within the traditions of Hindu Saiva culture and adhered to the Hindu Saiva doctrine. He was an unapologetic defender of Hindu Shaivism. Although he never cared much for his caste identity, as he considered all living beings as equal, his efforts led to the consolidation of traditional privileges of Hindu Saiva Vellala (farmers, landlords) and Karaiyar (warriors). Although Navalar did not show much interest in Tamil politics and kept his focus on defending the Hindu Shaiva faith in Sri Lanka and South India, his aggressive preaching of a Hindu Saiva cultural heritage contributed to the growth Tamil nationalism. The Tamil nationalist movement had an element that \\"Hindu Saiva Siddhanta preceded all others as the original Tamil religion\\", states Dennis Hudson. Navalar's insistence on the Agamas as the criteria of Hindu Saiva worship, moreover, gave momentum to the tendency among Tamils everywhere to attempt to subsume local deities under the Agamic pantheon and to abandon animal sacrifice altogether. Navalar and his followers have been accused by some such as Sivathamby of focusing on the religious literature \\"in their anxiety\\", and \\"openly keeping away\\" from the secular Tamil literature, as they opposed the Christian missionaries. According to David Shulman, however, Navalar was among the pioneers who first located and printed the predominantly non-religious Tamil Sangam literature in 1851 (Thirumurukaattuppadai, one of the Ten Idylls) and the earliest paper editions of a palm-leaf manuscript on the ancient Tamil grammar text, Tolkappiyam. According to Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì a Tamil literature scholar, Navalar was one of the key persons who identified, edited and published the secular and religious classical Tamil literature before 1879. He also inspired his fellow Tamils to publish Hindu texts and their translations. His critics state that Navalar was an example of a \\"hegemonic caste\\" and his hidden agenda was to promote his own caste. Arumuga Navalar found support from the Brahmins and his own literati caste of Vellalas in the Tamil community, according to Wilson, because he accepted and recognized their caste-based status. His supporters state that Navalar had no such hidden agenda, and his active efforts to reform attest to Navalar's commitment to end social vices such as alcoholism, violence against animals and others. According to Peter Schalk, Navalar has also been accused of despising the Vaishnava and Jaina community. Navalar's legacy has provoked negative reactions and criticism from the political left of South Asia. Navalar, states Schalk, was a theologian who used indirect \\"metonymic language\\" with \\"coded words\\" that metaphorically supported the traditional caste system privileges within the colonial era administration. His supporters, in contrast, interpret the same \\"coded words\\" differently and view him as an \\"organic intellectual\\" committed to religious growth through reforms and one committed to the human rights and freedom struggle of the Tamil people.

Services were operated jointly by the London and North Western Railway and Great Western Railway up until the 1923 Grouping, then by the GWR and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. After nationalisation in 1948, the station became part of the London Midland region of British Railways. The route through the station carried significant amounts of freight from the outset, from the docks at Birkenhead and later from the oil refineries and dock complex at Ellesmere Port as well as a local passenger service between Birkenhead Monks Ferry (from opening until March 1878)/ (from April 1878) or and Helsby, where passenger could access the other section of the joint line between Warrington Bank Quay and . This station was earmarked for closure, along with Stanlow and Thornton, Helsby and Ellesmere Port, under the proposals made by Dr. Beeching. This was never implemented, although services gradually began to reduce and the remaining through trains to/from Birkenhead Woodside ended in 1967 when the station there was closed.\\"Disused Stations - Birkenhead Woodside\\" Disused Stations; Retrieved 21 March 2014 Ince & Elton station Sign, Platform 2 Services originally operated regularly between Helsby and Hooton via Ellesmere Port, with some services running through to Rock Ferry prior to the electrification of the line between there and Hooton in 1985. Once electric trains began running to Hooton, the service was revamped to run between Chester and Helsby via Hooton (with a reversal there) every 30 minutes on weekdays & Saturdays. Convenient connections were available at Helsby for Warrington & Manchester and at Hooton for Liverpool. However, following the extension of the third rail southwards to Chester in 1993, the service east of Ellesmere Port was cut back substantially ‚Äì most trains ran as a shuttle to Ellesmere Port only, with only a two-hourly service beyond there. The pattern was then altered again when electrification of the Hooton to Ellesmere Port section was completed in 1994 ‚Äì from that point onwards, all services from Helsby terminated at Ellesmere Port but ran beyond Helsby to Warrington Bank Quay and Liverpool Lime Street (every two hours Mon-Sat), calling at all stations en route. The new service was poorly patronised though, and by 1996 it had been cut back to the current pattern of two pairs of services each way in the early morning and mid afternoon. Some station signs are outdated, displaying information about those former services to Chester and Hooton (see image of sign on Platform 2).

The likelihood of electrifying the line and incorporating into the Merseyrail network was low, as there are many dangerous substances and cables surrounding the trackside as the line passes through the Stanlow oil refinery. However, Merseytravel have shown interest in taking ownership of the Halton Curve south of Runcorn to incorporate into the Merseyrail network. This might entail the line being electrified and brought onto the Merseyrail network, giving access to Runcorn, Liverpool South Parkway for John Lennon Airport and maybe onto Liverpool Lime Street.

A normal service operates on most Bank Holidays. In the event of buses replacing trains, only one service in each direction runs, usually in the late afternoon. In British Rail terminology, this station's rail service(s) would be referred to as a 'Parliamentary train'. This means that the Train Operating Company only runs the minimum number of services required legally, and usually at the least busy times of day, in order to still comply with the law, but to keep operating costs down to an absolute minimum. It is cheaper to run this service than going through a lengthy legal process of applying for station closures. North Cheshire Rail User Group A rail user group, the North Cheshire Rail User Group, supports and actively campaigns for an improved service at this station and for this railway line. Public transport interchange  The station approach at Ince & Elton Station At the station exit, there are hourly bus services. The number X2, operated by Stagecoach Merseyside, operates towards Runcorn, or in the opposite direction, towards Ellesmere Port and onward towards Chester. Buses run until around 19:00 local time. These services only run Monday-Saturday. This means that Ince and Elton villages are not served by any public transport on Sundays. There is a free small car park located just outside the station. There is no CCTV or staff at this station. Freight Freightliner usually run a class 70 'heavy-haul' service to Ellesmere Port twice a day from/to Fiddlers Ferry on Monday to Fridays. On Saturdays there is one scheduled working. When the Shell oil refinery at Stanlow used the railways to transport freight, over fifteen trains per day used this line. Since then, the sidings and signal box have been removed, and freight is becoming increasingly rare on this line. No freight trains currently use the station, other than to pass through it.

Biography Stamm was born on a Sunday morning (to his parents, an indication God had a special work for him), 23 March 1878, a son of Hanz and Mary Stamm. The Stamms were devout Christians and members of the Evangelical Association Church in Alida,Few references are available online to the town of Alida. It was evacuated in the 1960s when its territory was submerged by a dam built to create Milford Lake Geary County, Kansas, which they had helped organize seven years before. Conversion and call At the age of ten, John became so disturbed by a sermon he heard one Sunday morning that he went to a hillside after church to pray. :\\"I prayed because I had a very keen sense of the need of the saving grace of God in Christ. Suddenly, as I was praying there came to me a sense of peace, release and trust...a new joy filled my life...I came into an assurance that I was a Christian...because I had come into personal saving relationship with God.\\" A few Sundays later, his Pastor remarked that he was growing old and would soon need to lay down his work. He asked, \\"Who will take my place?\\" And young John Stamm remembers thinking \\"I will!\\" At the age of eighteen he experienced another turning point in his young life. Sitting with several other teenage boys one night when the preacher gave the invitation to come to the altar, John turned to his friends and said, \\"If I go, will you go?\\" They assured him they would. So they filed down the center aisle to the altar. \\"That night I found Jesus Christ as my personal Savior,\\" Bishop Stamm later wrote. \\"It was an experience of great joy and meaning and still is today,\\" he wrote in 1955. \\"I made a complete turnabout in life. Instead of doubting God, I now loved Him...things of the spirit had new interest and challenge for me...the call of the Christian ministry came to me with clear and convincing urgency.\\" Education Stamm had completed less than five grades of public school when he turned twenty. Nevertheless, that fall he sold his horse and other possessions to obtain enough money for a train ticket to Naperville, Illinois, the home of The Evangelical Association's North Central College and Evangelical Theological Seminary (E.T.S.). He took sub-academy courses at the College, along with others who had also not finished high school. Twelve years later Stamm had completed his college degree and graduated from the seminary. In 1927, E.T.S. honored him with a Doctor of Divinity degree. He received a Doctor of Laws degree from Albright College in 1936, a Doctor of Humane Letters from North Central College in 1949, and a Doctor of Sacred Theology from Dickinson College in 1951. Ordained ministry In 1901 Stamm was appointed Pastor of the Glasgow, Missouri Evangelical Mission. \\"When I met the Class Leader at the railroad station, he greeted me rather formally, then said, 'I had better tell you right away, we do not want you.' He said they had requested the conference not to send an unmarried man to this mission.\\" While serving there Stamm became acquainted with Priscilla Marie Wahl. She taught in the Primary Department of the Sunday School and was elected Superintendent when only nineteen. On 19 March 1912 they were married during the time that Rev. Stamm was the Pastor of the Manhattan Evangelical Church. Shortly thereafter he was appointed to the Oak Park Village Church. Two nights before Christmas, 1918, Bishop Spreng informed Rev. Stamm by telephone that he had been elected to teach Systematic Theology at E.T.S. He remained at the seminary until elected Bishop. His theological scholarship was recognized in his service as a Consulting Editor for the publication of both the Revised Standard Version of the Bible and of The Interpreters Bible. Episcopal ministry His first assignment as Bishop of the Evangelical Church was Kansas City. During those first eight years, Stamm also served as the General Secretary of Evangelism for his denomination. After Kansas City, in 1934 he was assigned to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. There he also served until 1941 as President of The Evangelical School of Theology at Reading, Pennsylvania. Bishop Stamm gave statesman-like leadership to the Pennsylvania Council of Churches (1945‚Äì49) and to the Federal Council of Churches (1948‚Äì50), serving as President of each of those organizations. He was a member of the 1948 organizing Assembly of the World Council of Churches, serving on its Central Committee until 1954. Retirement When Bishop Stamm requested retirement at the 1950 General Conference of the Evangelical United Brethren Church, he said :\\"Through the goodness of God, I have been able to serve in the Cheristian ministry for more than fifty-one and a half years...From the hour when I yielded to God in response to the call to the Christian ministry to this very day, I have been under a commanding sense of stewardship which impelled me to make this ministry central in my thought and life: to give Christ the preeminence in all things, and to give myself wholly to this work...I can honestly say, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.\\" Bishop Stamm closed his farewell address by saying :\\"I am not tired of the Christian ministry...The years that lie ahead are in the hands of God...Officially I will stand on the sidelines, but I shall cheer for our leaders. I shall do more. I shall pray\\",John S. Stamm, \\"Request for Superannuated Relationship,\\" in Official Proceedings of the Thirty-Seventh General Conference of The Evangelical United Brethren Church (Dayton, Ohio: Otterbein Press, 1950), pp. 118‚Äì119.

RCA Dimensia speaker mounted on a baffle with no back A dipole speaker enclosure in its simplest form is constructed by mounting a loudspeaker driver on a flat panel. The panel may be folded to conserve space. The term dipole derives from the fact that the polar response consists of two lobes, with equal radiation forwards and backwards, and none perpendicular to the axis. By comparison a monopole response consists of one lobe. This can be useful in reducing the stimulation of resonant room modes at low frequencies. It also results in high frequencies being reflected from any rear wall, which can enhance the naturalness of the sound in typical listening rooms by creating more diffuse reverberation, though in theory it could detract from stereo localization. For this reason dipole speakers are often used as surround channel speakers, where a diffuse sound is desired to create ambience. A dipole speaker works by creating air movement (as sound pressure waves) directly from the front and back surfaces of the driver, rather than by impedance matching one or both outputs to the air. As a result, diaphragm motion is constrained primarily by the driver's restoring force (e.g., diaphragm suspension) and not by acoustic loading from an enclosure. This implies that cone motion will be larger at the same output level than in a more usual enclosure, and that power handling will be accordingly limited. Especially at lower frequencies, dipole drivers tend to be large and flat, and necessarily open at both front and back. Common examples include electrostatic or ribbon drivers, though a conventional cone driver mounted in an open baffle also works as a dipole loudspeaker. All of these variations are characterised by a \\"figure-of-eight\\" radiation pattern in which the loudness falls towards the sides of the enclosure where interference between front and back waves is maximized. Sometimes the enclosure is modified into an \\"H-frame\\" with the driver located on a wall dividing two open compartments. Such enclosures require some control over the radiated sound from the rear of the enclosure to achieve the desired response. This is usually done by mounting two drivers, one over the other, in a push-pull configuration. Some of the speaker cabinets referred to as dipolar arrange the two poles at an angle of about 90 degrees rather than 180 degrees, especially for wall-mounted rear speakers (e.g. Jamo C-80-SUR, Castle dipoles, and Theophanyhttp://www.theophanyloudspeakers.com/multi.php?cat=10 Theophany Surround Speakers S4). Advantages An advantage of dipoles is that the sound is concentrated in the listening area due to the figure-of-eight polar response. This means that for a given output loudness, locations falling within the \\"dead-zone\\" of the speaker do not perceive as loud a sound as they would with more traditional enclosures. Dipole speakers are said to be better for rear speakers in surround-sound systems,http://blog.stereotype.co.nz/2009/02/why-dipole-rear-speakers-are- better/ Why Dipole Rear Speakers are Better although this is disputed (or at least success depends on factors such as room acoustics, type of music, and so on). The THX standard specifies dipoles for the surround speakers in home theater, but that part of the spec is often ignored in practice. Disadvantages However, these enclosures are less efficient because, for the same driver, a dipole results in less sound pressure level than a closed or ported enclosure, and certainly far less than a properly designed horn. This means that the drivers mounted on a dipole enclosure must have large maximum excursions, large square areas, or both. One solution to these problems is to cross over to a closed or ported enclosure that handles the low frequencies. Another solution is to construct the dipole by means of a bipole with signal processing controlling the polar pattern. This enables switching between different polar patterns http://www.htguide.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-13636.html or varying the polar pattern and efficiency versus frequency and versus output level.

General information Lars is a true veteran of the music business having played in bands and later as a solo artist since the late 1970s. Lars's first instrument was the bass, and it was not until he was over 20 years old that he switched to the guitar. Initially influenced by the classic-hard rock of the late 60s and 70s like Jimi Hendrix, Richie Blackmore, Johnny Winter but also Al DiMeola, Lars later became one of the early developers of the neoclassical metal genre. Lars was discovered by Mike Varney (Guitar Player Magazine and Shrapnel Records ) in 1985. After playing and touring with various local hard rock bands Lars recorded and released the 4 track vinyl EP ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Go On Without Your Love‚Äù in 1987. Soon after this Lars signed to Black Dragon Records, a French indie label for which he recorded 3 albums Eternity (1988), No Surrender (1989) and the all instrumental Electric Voodoo (1991). Eternity and No Surrender were released in Japan by FEMS, while the instrumental Electric Voodoo was picked up by Leviathan Records in USA and released under the Title ‚ÄúThe Exciter‚Äù in 1992, and then in 1995 it was released in Asia by SKC. In 1992 Lars teamed up with Swedish singer Conny Lind who had been in Los Angeles working with Alex Masi and together with Drummer Tony Mattsson and Bass player Michael Ahlskog they formed the band 'Vision' and recorded 1992's album 'Lars Eric Mattsson's Vision' which went down very well specially in Japan where it was once again released by FEMS and in Europe by Roadrunner. The year after Vision recorded a follow up album, which was never released due to the label's coming bankruptcy and the band eventually split up. Around 1994 when Lars was found playing in cover bands doing blues classics and Hendrix covers Lars got in contact with another Swedish singer Bj√∂rn Lodin, who had released some albums with his own band Baltimoore. As the band split up Bj√∂rn joined forces with Lars And recorded 1995's album 'Astral Groove', which was blues based and quite different from Lars previous releases. However the band split up too soon and Lars was actually considering quitting music completely for a while. In 1996 Lars wanted to give 'Vision' a second chance and recorded the album 'Till the End of Time' which was his most laid back melodic- almost AOR - release ever. The album got very good reactions and was a living proof that melodic hard rock still had an audience. Singer Randolph Reymers made his debut as lead singer after having sung backing vocals on several albums before Vision. As VISION was taking a break from recording Lars went into in studio at the end of August 1997 with a bunch of new songs which definitely showed that hard work pays off. This new album was Lars finest hour thus far in 'Obsession' with his best guitar playing ever as well as some of his better compositions. Add to that singer Bj√∂rn Lodin who never sounded this good before! The reviews of 'Obsession' were excellent, Progression magazine of USA called the album 1998's best Guitar album and it was clear to everyone that Lars had taken a major step forward, but Lars felt it was just the beginning of a new era. In autumn 1999 Lars begun writing for another album and just to make things more interesting Lars invited some friends and well known musicians to guest on the project. These included: Patrick Rondat (Jean Michel Jarre) Rob Johnson (Magnitude 9), Erik Norlander (Lana Lane, Rocket Scientists) P√§r Lindh (P√§r Lindh Project) Esa Pietil√§ and more... The new 70+ minute long opus consists of 14 new compositions jam packed with Intense musical ideas influenced by classical music, classic hard rock, heavy metal, progressive rock/metal with many virtuoso performances from Lars and his guests. The album has soft melodic ballads and odd-meter riffing. In 2000 Lars put together a progressive band called 'Condition Red', the debut album features keyboard maestro Derek Sherinian (ex- Alice Cooper/Dream Theater) and Lars‚Äô friend Alex Masi (on additional guitars). Lars next project was to record a new Mattsson album, this time with ex-Balance of Power singer Lance King, and the result,'Power Games' was released in 2003 and received fantastic reviews all over the world. In 2003 Condition Red reformed to record and release their second album of progressive rock titled ‚ÄúII‚Äù, not too long after this Lars band from the 1990s made a short comeback in 2004 with a new album ‚ÄúOn the Edge‚Äù, however Lars major work in 2004 was the new super group 'Book Of Reflections' which include singer Andy Engberg (ex-Lion's Share/Section A etc...), Vitalij Kuprij etc...but Lars biggest challenge this far was the progressive metal concept album/metal opera 'War' which was released in 2005 and which features: Mark Boals (Yngwie Malmsteen), Vitalij Kuprij, Lance King, Rene Janssen(Ayreon), Benny Jansson (Tears of Anger/Beyond Twilight) etc... The same year also saw the first instrumental release in 10 years in the guise of the eclectic \\"Earthbound\\". Mattsson found a new vein of creativity and by 2006 had completed \\"Book Of Reflections II : Unfold The Future\\" with vocals by Martin LeMar (Tomorrow's Eve) and Bj√∂rn Jansson (Ride The Sky / Tears Of Anger), with additional guitar from Anand Mahangoe (Sphere Of Souls) and keyboards from Mistheria (solo, Bruce Dickinson, Angel Of Eden). 2008 saw Mattsson gearing up for the accessible symphonic and prog metal of 'Dream Child'. Joining Lars was new vocalist, the female Adrienn Antal whosevoice saw Mattsson step out on a new path with its potent new sound for 2008. 2009 saw the re-release of a newly recorded and remastered version of' 'No Surrender + Live which came with five bonus live tracks from the Mattsson archives. The album was warmly greeted by press worldwide. The rest of the year saw Lars write the follow up to 'Dream Child'. March 19, 2010 sees the release of 'Tango', the new album released under the Mattsson banner which again sees Adrienn Antal on vocals along with new addition of Status Minor vocalist Markku Kuikka. Lars spent countless hours putting together the intelligent and highly accomplished music which looks set to take the Mattsson name to a new fan base worldwide. Never one to sit still Lars then set about composing the music for his next album, the all instrumental 'Aurura Borealis' which is set for release on April 18, 2011. This new album pushes the boundaries of a guitar with an orchestra context by delivering a very original take on the more traditional format used by the likes of Uli Jon Roth etc. In 2012 Lars started working on his next album Epicentre, which was finished 12 months later and released in September 2013 as digital download only. This 18 track album sees Lars handling all the vocals as well while musically Lars seem to have gone for shorter more accessible songs while still incorporating some new influences. As Lars was celebrating 25 years since his two first albums were released in Japan 2014 saw Lars releasing a number of reissues and new compilations of previously unreleased material, such as both Condition Red albums in new versions, the two compilations Hot and Able 1983-85 and Let Me Rock You 1984-87 each containing 16 tracks from Lars early days. Also released under 2014 were a new version of the second Book of Reflections album Chapter II - Unfold the Future as well as new versions (all including bonus tracks) of \\"Earthbound\\" (October 24, 2014), \\"Eternity\\" (November 14,02014) and \\"No Surrender\\" (December 12, 2014). In September 2015 Lars released his first all- acoustic album Songs From a Different Room, an album that had been in the making since late 2008. The album's ten intimate tracks all feature vocals by Lars and some of his best guitar playing to date. Also released in 2015: Condition Red's Beatles cover \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as single. In 2016 Condition Red released its third album Illusion of Truth, a progressive concept album which saw Lars handling all guitars, bass and vocals, just like as on the Condition Red single released a year before. This year Lars also released a four-track EP \\"Never Coming Home\\", the title track was a remix of a 1989 \\"No Surrender\\" album out take paired with two live tracks \\"The Exciter\\" and \\"Eternity\\" as well as the previously unreleased 1989 version of the title track. On November 16 Lars returned with his first all-electric rock album in four years, Sand and Blood, and as it is thirty years after his debut EP Can't Go On Without Your Love, Lars decided to include a new recording of this classic (true to the original). The album also features a guest appearance by Adrienn Antal singing the album's last song, \\"Still Here Waiting\\".

It was designed by architect Robert C. Reamer, notable for his design of the Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone Park. It was part of the Fox Film Corporation Empire founded by studio mogul William Fox. The theater opened September 3, 1931 and showed films continuously until it closed September 21, 2000 after an engagement of the movie Gladiator starring Russell Crowe. History Opening The Fox Theater opened with seating for 2,350 patrons (1,450 on the ground floor and 900 in the balcony) on . The cost of construction was publicized as , and the Fox opened with a live production of Fanchon and Marco's About Town, followed by the film Merely Mary Ann one week later. Anita Page, Mitzi Green, George O'Brien, Victor McLaglen and El Brendel attended the opening performance gala. Interior decorations and appointments, designed by Anthony Heinsbergen, were singled out for praise in contemporary newspaper accounts. Multiplex and Decline In May 1961, The Fox Theater sold its organ to a Los Angeles-area collector, who disassembled it and had it shipped to California. The process of dismantling the organ took approximately one week. The Fox Theater subdivided its main screen and opened as a three-screen complex (with one main screen downstairs and two balcony screens upstairs) on . In 1989, the theater began showing second-run movies at per ticket. When Regal Cinemas built the new 12-screen megaplex at NorthTown Mall, it sold half of its eight Spokane theaters, including the Fox. The final movie, a screening of Gladiator, was shown on , and a small ceremony marked the sale of the theater to the Spokane Symphony. Restoration The adjacent Spokane Club sought to purchase and demolish the building to build a parking garage. Although the club had entered into negotiations with the then-owners, Regal Cinemas, the Club dropped its plans to purchase the theater when they learned the Spokane Symphony was interested in the site. The theater was saved when the Spokane Symphony purchased it for million in June 2000. Once the Symphony determined whether the renovations were feasible and the funds could be raised, it began an extensive fund raising campaign to raise the budget needed for restoration. Part of the funds were raised from state sources. Prominent architectural features were renamed in honor of significant donors. The restoration designer was NAC Architecture of Spokane. Restorers cleaned and painted, recreated lost architectural details and lighting fixtures. They also removed partitions installed in 1975 which converted the theatre into a multiplex. They reduced the original 2,300 seats to 1,700. The Wurlitzer 3-manual, 13-rank theatre organ installed when the building was constructed in 1931 was removed in 1961. The total cost of the renovations was $31 million and it was completed in November 2007. The theatre was renamed the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in honor of the father of a donor who contributed $3 million towards the renovations. It re-opened as the home of the Spokane Symphony on November 17, 2007, presided over by Washington Governor Christine Gregoire. The re-opening included a special celebration featuring a performance by Tony Bennett on November 19, 2007.  Notable performances  Notable performances at the theatre include: Katharine Hepburn, in As You Like It, as well as Marian Anderson, Bing Crosby, and Frank Sinatra.

Every episode is believed to be missing and only short clips survive. Format The format of the show in the tradition of classic children's television shows in the vein of Bozo the Clown: the show would begin with the same pre-recorded sequence and lead into a live studio audience of children chanting \\"Koopa! Koopa! Koopa!\\" at the beginning of the show. The audience of children were all given special hats shaped like Koopa heads and T-shirts with \\"Koopa's Troopas\\" printed on them (the children would actually get to keep the shirts, but the troopa helmets, as they called them, were claimed by the producers at the end of the taping and reused every show). The live-action Koopa would then act as emcee, introducing old, public domain animated cartoon shorts for the length of the show (none of the actual Mario cartoons that were produced were ever shown). King Koopa would end the show by giving a child gift certificates or NES products, particularly the Power Glove, which was a popular toy for the Christmas holiday season. King Koopa The show featured an actor in a King Koopa costume similar to one previously used in the Super Mario Bros.-themed Ice Capades show, only with a more detailed mask to make the actor more believable on television. The actor playing Koopa (originally Chris Latta, later Pat Pinney) performed the role with a gruff, gravel-voiced faux-malevolence that ultimately revealed a hesitantly nice personality. Unlike any previous appearance, Koopa was seen with a pet creature named Ratso that best resembled a mix of dog and weasel with the large ears of a bat. Ratso had his own special \\"theater\\" where kids could also claim prizes (in which he was played by a puppet). Koopa would be seen walking Ratso on a leash in the pre-recorded opening and closing credit sequences (where he was played by a dog in a costume). Awards By 1990, the program was nominated as the best youth program for the Los Angeles local Emmy Awards.Bernstein, Sharon. \\"Channel 2 Leads Pack in Emmy Nominations.\\" Los Angeles Times.

In the first stores, the only products sold were beer, snacks and cigars. The success of the stores was such that the project kept growing and OXXO built new locations rapidly, becoming an ubiquitous presence in Mexican cities and towns. The first official OXXO store was opened in 1978 in Monterrey. OXXO stores then spread to Chihuahua, Hermosillo and Nuevo Laredo. Throughout the eighties, OXXO gained fame in the cities where it was established. In 1998, the 1000th store was opened. On July 6, 2011, the opening of the 9000th store, in Oaxaca, was announced. With Mexico liberalizing its oil and gas market, OXXO has started to open gas stations as well. The first station opened in San Pedro Garza Garcia.

The philosophy behind Freeway is that an average user is able to design websites without having to deal with any code, using an interface very similar to that of Desktop publishing applications like QuarkXPress or Adobe InDesign. Advanced procedures (like connecting to a MySQL database using a scripting language like PHP) are done through plug-ins called \\"Actions\\". Several Actions can be downloaded for free on several websites, but there are also commercial 3rd Party Actions, like the \\"Auction Seller Suite\\" from FreewayActions.com, which allows the creation of eBay- friendly HTML within the Freeway design interface. Many useful Actions are bundled with Freeway, the latest set from Softpress being a suite of Actions that lets the user create a shopping cart through the popular Mals e-commerce system. Unlike most other WYSIWYG web design applications, Freeway produces syntactically valid HTML code and Cascading Style Sheets, making it usable in situations where valid HTML code is obligatory. For example, valid code is required by law on the majority of federal and state institutions' web sites in Germany. Versions of Freeway from 4.4 onwards also create HTML and CSS that correct many rendering problems with Internet Explorer 6 on Windows. On July 4, 2016, Softpress announced the end of development on Freeway and other software products via a post on the homepage stating, \\"The end of Softpress Systems Ltd. has come. It has become clear that our prospects, both in terms of current revenue and new product development, are insufficient to sustain the company as a viable entity going forward.\\" At the start of 2017 the author of Freeway announced the resumption of Softpress' business but, due to limited staff, without in-house tech support, referring to a thriving on-line user groups for support. It currently offers five products: Freeway, Freeway Express (a basic version of Freeway), Chroma (for selecting color palettes), Exhibio (photo gallery creation), and Fretspace (for creating chord diagrams). They also offer a range of Freeway templates under the name, Marketplace.
