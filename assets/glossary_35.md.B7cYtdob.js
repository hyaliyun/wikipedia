Description and history The historical type of broadsides, designed to be plastered onto walls, were ephemera, i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. They were one of the most common forms of printed material between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in Britain, Ireland and North America. They were often advertisements, but could also be used for news information or proclamations. Broadsides were a very popular medium for printing topical ballads starting in the 16th century. Broadside ballads were printed on thin sheets of paper and sold in the Victorian era London for a penny or half-penny. Broadsides were generally folded twice to make small pamphlets or chapbooks. Collections of songs in chapbooks were known as garlands. Broadside ballads lasted longer in Ireland, and although never produced in such huge numbers in North America, they were significant in the eighteenth century and provided an important medium of propaganda, on both sides, in the American War of Independence.M. Savelle, Seeds of liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind (Kessinger Publishing, 2005), p. 533. Broadsides were commonly sold at public executions in the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries. These were often produced by printers who specialised in them. They were typically illustrated by a crude picture of the crime, a portrait of the criminal, or a generic woodcut of a hanging taking place. There would be a written account of the crime and of the trial and often the criminal's confession of guilt. A doggerel verse warning others to not follow the executed person's example, to avoid their fate, was another common feature. By the mid-19th century, the advent of newspapers and inexpensive novels resulted in the demise of the street literature broadside. One classic example of a broadside used for proclamations is the Dunlap broadside, which was the first publication of the United States Declaration of Independence, printed on the night of July 4, 1776 by John Dunlap of Philadelphia in an estimated 200 copies.Illustration for Widmer, Ted, \\"Looking for Liberty\\", oped commentary article, The New York Times, July 4, 2008, accessed July 7, 2008 An example of a broadside used for news information is the first published account of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River, printed on December 30, 1776 by unknown.Library of Congress ‚Äì An American Time Capsule, \\"Congress received the following intelligence...\\" Retrieved 2011-07-06 Today, broadside printing is done by many smaller printers and publishers as a fine art variant, with poems often being available as broadsides, intended to be framed and hung on the wall. Broadsides pasted on walls are still used as a form of mass communication in Haredi Jewish communities, where they are known by the Yiddish term \\"pashkevil\\" (pasquil), even if they are not attacks or lampoons.

Function  CXCR-4 is an alpha-chemokine receptor specific for stromal-derived-factor-1 (SDF-1 also called CXCL12), a molecule endowed with potent chemotactic activity for lymphocytes. CXCR4 is one of several chemokine co-receptors that HIV can use to infect CD4+ T cells. HIV isolates that use CXCR4 are traditionally known as T-cell tropic isolates. Typically, these viruses are found late in infection. It is unclear as to whether the emergence of CXCR4-using HIV is a consequence or a cause of immunodeficiency. CXCR4 is upregulated during the implantation window in natural and hormone replacement therapy cycles in the endometrium, producing, in presence of a human blastocyst, a surface polarization of the CXCR4 receptors suggesting that this receptor is implicated in the adhesion phase of human implantation. CXCR4's ligand SDF-1 is known to be important in hematopoietic stem cell homing to the bone marrow and in hematopoietic stem cell quiescence. It has been also shown that CXCR4 signalling regulates the expression of CD20 on B cells. Until recently, SDF-1 and CXCR4 were believed to be a relatively monogamous ligand- receptor pair (other chemokines are promiscuous, tending to use several different chemokine receptors). Recent evidence demonstrates ubiquitin is also a natural ligand of CXCR4. Ubiquitin is a small (76-amino acid) protein highly conserved among eukaryotic cells. It is best known for its intracellular role in targeting ubiquitylated proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system. Evidence in numerous animal models suggests ubiquitin is anti-inflammatory immune modulator and endogenous opponent of proinflammatory damage associated molecular pattern molecules. It is speculated this interaction may be through CXCR4 mediated signalling pathways. MIF is an additional ligand of CXCR4 CXCR4 is present in newly generated neurons during embryogenesis and adult life where it plays a role in neuronal guidance. The levels of the receptor decrease as neurons mature. CXCR4 mutant mice have aberrant neuronal distribution. This has been implicated in disorders such as epilepsy.  Clinical significance  Drugs that block the CXCR4 receptor appear to be capable of \\"mobilizing\\" hematopoietic stem cells into the bloodstream as peripheral blood stem cells. Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization is very important in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (as a recent alternative to transplantation of surgically harvested bone marrow) and is currently performed using drugs such as G-CSF. G-CSF is a growth factor for neutrophils (a common type of white blood cells), and may act by increasing the activity of neutrophil-derived proteases such as neutrophil elastase in the bone marrow leading to proteolytic degradation of SDF-1. Plerixafor (AMD3100) is a drug, approved for routine clinical use, which directly blocks the CXCR4 receptor. It is a very efficient inducer of hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in animal and human studies. In a small human clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fucoidan ingestion (brown seaweed extract), 3g daily of 75% w/w oral fucoidan for 12 days increased the proportion of CD34+CXCR4+ from 45 to 90% and the serum SDF-1 levels, which could be useful in CD34+ cells homing/mobilization via SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. It has been associated with WHIM syndrome. WHIM like mutations in CXCR4 were recently identified in patients with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, a B-cell malignancy. The presence of CXCR4 WHIM mutations has been associated with clinical resistance to ibrutinib in patients with Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia. While CXCR4's expression is low or absent in many healthy tissues, it was demonstrated to be expressed in over 23 types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Expression of this receptor in cancer cells has been linked to metastasis to tissues containing a high concentration of CXCL12, such as lungs, liver and bone marrow. However, in breast cancer where SDF1/CXCL12 is also expressed by the cancer cells themselves along with CXCR4, CXCL12 expression is positively correlated with disease free (metastasis free) survival. CXCL12 (over-)expressing cancers might not sense the CXCL12 gradient released from the metastasis target tissues since the receptor, CXCR4, is saturated with the ligand produced in an autocrine manner. Another explanation of this observation is provided by a study that shows the ability of CXCL12 (and CCL2) producing tumors to entrain neutrophils that inhibit seeding of tumor cells in the lung.  Drug response  Chronic exposure to THC has been shown to increase T lymphocyte CXCR4 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in rhesus macaques. It has been shown that BCR signalling inhibitors also affect CXCR4 pathway and thus CD20 expression.  Interactions  CXCR4 has been shown to interact with USP14.

The company has been the subject of scandals related to founder Bryan Kocis, who engaged in sex with a minor in one instance, and hired an underage actor to perform in another. Kocis was murdered in 2007, and although Cobra Video's website is still active, there have been no new video releases since Kocis‚Äô death.  Legal issues  In 2002, police found a videotape in the home of Bryan Kocis (then 39) engaged in sexual activity with what proved to be a 15-year-old teenage boy. Kocis, then owner and producer of Cobra Video and owner of a local adult- video store, met the boy on the internet and transported him to Kocis' hometown. Kocis pled guilty to one count of sexual abuse of a child; he was charged with child pornography and transportation of a minor for sexual purposes. Kocis claimed as a defense that the teenage boy lied about his age. Pacific Sun Entertainment (Cobra's distributor) advised its retail sellers, in September 2005, to withhold from further distribution four of Cobra's most popular videos (Every Poolboy's Dream, Schoolboy Crush, Bareboned Twinks, and Casting Couch 4) when reports surfaced that a featured model, Brent Corrigan was, at the time of filming, under 18 years of age. Pacific Sun Entertainment further advised, via an industry-wide email, the removal from availability additional Cobra Video product titles (Campus Boys 1 and Campus Boys 2) without reason except that in the past such action stemmed from a problem with distribution of questionable product such as performer's age. The Kocis murder was motivated by a rival studio power play involving Corrigan.  Kocis death  On January 24, 2007, Bryan Kocis was found dead in his Dallas Township, Pennsylvania, home. According to the Luzerne County coroner investigating the death, Kocis was stabbed 28 times and his throat was cut before his body was left in his house, which was set on fire after he died. A folding-style knife was found in the house near Kocis' body. Officials used dental records to identify him, as his body was burned beyond recognition. In May 2007 Harlow Cuadra and Joseph Kerekes, both adult film actors/producers, were arrested and charged with his murder. Police took the pair into custody after discovering evidence on Kocis' computer hard drive, which survived the fire. Police theorized that the pair killed Kocis because they wanted to work with a particular actor who was under contract to him. Prosecutors believed that one of the suspects e-mailed Kocis, assuming the identity of an aspiring porn actor, and arranged to meet him on January 24, 2007. The e-mail's sender asked to meet Kocis alone. The pair appear on video surveillance buying a gun and a lock-blade folding knife at a local pawn shop. The knife is consistent with the one used to stab Kocis. Additionally, police have audio recordings of one of the suspects saying, \\"Actually seeing that fucker going down, it's actually sick, but it made me feel better inside. It almost felt like I got revenge and I know that sounds fucked up.\\" In a search of the pair's home, police also found video equipment they believe belonged to Kocis.Gay porn actors charged with killing executive in scheme to work with star; Simon, Mallory, CourtTV.com; 2007-07-17.

The novel is a semi-autobiographical story about a 14-year-old Hungarian Jew's experiences in the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps. The book is the first part of a trilogy, which continues in A kudarc (\\"Fiasco\\" ) and Kaddis a meg nem sz√ºletett gyermek√©rt (\\"Kaddish for an Unborn Child\\" ). Kert√©sz won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002, \\"for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history\\". The book was first translated into English by Christopher C. Wilson and Katharina M. Wilson in 1992 as Fateless ( and ), while in 2004 a second translation by Tim Wilkinson appeared () under the title Fatelessness. In the UK edition, Wilkinson's translation retained the title Fateless ().  Plot summary  The novel is about a young Hungarian boy, Gy√∂rgy \\"Gyuri\\" K√∂ves, living in Budapest. The book opens as Gy√∂rgy's father is being sent to a labor camp. Soon afterwards, Gy√∂rgy receives working papers and travels to work outside of the Jewish quarter. One day all of the Jews are pulled off of the buses leaving the Jewish quarter, and are sent to Auschwitz on a train without water. Arriving there, Gy√∂rgy lies about his age, unknowingly saving his own life, and tells us of camp life and the conditions he faces. Eventually he is sent to Buchenwald, and continues on describing his life in a concentration camp, before being finally sent to another camp in Zeitz. Gy√∂rgy falls ill and nears death, but remains alive and is eventually sent to a hospital facility in a concentration camp until the war ends. Returning to Budapest, he is confronted with those who were not sent to camps and had just recently begun to hear of the terrible injustice and suffering.  Analysis  A notable parallel can be drawn between Fatelessness and Franz Kafka's The Trial. Both novels portray the descent of an innocent protagonist into the madness of a system in which he is caught and Gy√∂rgy's rationalizations for the events that occur around him bear a resemblance to the eventual acceptance by The Trial protagonist Josef K. of his own fate.  Movie  A movie version, with screenplay by Imre Kert√©sz, was released in 2005, made in Hungary by director Lajos Koltai, with Marcell Nagy in the starring role.

Jews have lived in Philadelphia since the arrival of William Penn in 1682. Colonial History Jewish traders have operated in southeastern Pennsylvania since at least the 1650s. The first Jewish resident of the city on record was Jonas Aaron whose name appears in 1703 in the American Historical Register. Several Jewish families had immigrated to Philadelphia by 1734, as recorded by German traveler von Beck who listed them among the religious sects of the town. Nathan Levy purchased ground for Jewish burial in 1738, obtained the grant on September 25, 1740, and is cared for by Congregation Mikveh Israel. = In the War of Independence = Many Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Leading up to the conflict, several Jewish merchants and other citizens of Philadelphia signed the Non-Importation Resolutions. By doing so, they agreed \\"not to have any goods shipped from Great Britain until after the repeal of the Stamp Act.\\" This was officially adopted on October 25, 1765. The Jewish signers included Benjamin Levy, David Franks, Samson Levy, Hyman Levy Jr., Mathias Bush, Moses Mordecai, Michael Gratz, and Barnard Gratz. The last two were brothers who had left Upper Silesia in Germany about 1755 and settled in Philadelphia. In 1777, just after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the following Jews agreed to accept the colonial paper money sanctioned by the king in lieu of gold and silver: Solomon Aaron, Joseph Solomon Kohn, Solomon Marache, Moses Mordecai, Barnard Soliman, and David Franks. Of these, Moses Mordecai and David Franks had signed the Non-Importation Resolutions. During the conflict, David Franks was conspicuous for his loyalty to the British cause, being the English agent in charge of the prisoners; his daughter, Rebecca Franks, took part in the \\"Mischianza,\\" the famous f√™te given in honor of General Howe during the British occupancy of Philadelphia. The majority of the Jews of the city, however, supported the American cause. Col. David Salisbury Franks was aide- de-camp to General Benedict Arnold at Philadelphia in 1779; Solomon Bush was major of the Pennsylvania militia; Col. Isaac Franks served with distinction in the war, as did Philip Moses, Russell and Benjamin Nones. Haym Solomon made loans to individuals in Congress, which were never repaid; his services as a financial agent during the war were invaluable. Another creditor of the Continental Congress was Aaron Levy, and his loans, like nearly all the others, were never fully repaid. At the close of the war the Jewish population of Philadelphia amounted to almost 500. In 1801, Rebecca Gratz helped establish the Female Association for the Relief of Women and Children in Reduced Circumstances, which helped women whose families were suffering after the American Revolutionary War. Congregation Mikveh Israel Congregation Mikveh Israel, the first Jewish congregation in Philadelphia, had its beginnings about 1745 and is believed to have worshiped in a small house in Sterling Alley. In 1761, owing to the influx of Spanish and Portuguese Jews from England, the Netherlands and the West Indies, the question of building a synagogue was raised, but nothing was then accomplished in that direction. In 1773, when Bernard Gratz was parnas and Solomon Marache treasurer, a subscription was started \\"in order to support our holy worship and establish it on a more solid foundation.\\" The number of Jewish residents in Philadelphia was suddenly increased at the outbreak of the American Revolution by the influx of Jewish patriots from New York, which had been captured by the British (Sept., 1776). The congregation removed from the house in Sterling Alley and then occupied quarters in Cherry Alley, between Third and Fourth streets. The building in Cherry Alley, which had sufficed for the few families in the city, became inadequate, and steps were taken to secure a more commodious building. Gershom Mendes Seixas, who had fled from New York to Connecticut, was requested to act as the first rabbi of the reorganized congregation. The estimate for the new building was ¬£600, and the subscription being inadequate, Haym Salomon, the banker and financial agent of the Continental Congress, agreed to pay one-fourth the cost. A lot was purchased in Cherry street, near Third street, and a suitable building erected. The governor of Pennsylvania and his official family were invited to attend the dedication ceremonies, which were held on September 13, 1782. At this time the congregation had over 100 members;(see list in Rosenbach's \\"Jews of Philadelphia,\\" p. 22) its officers were Jonas Phillips (president), Michael Gratz, Solomon Marache, Solomon Myers Cohen, and Simon Nathan. On November 25, 1783, New York was evacuated by the British, and many of the members of the congregation returned to their former homes. The congregation also started Mikveh Israel Cemetery. It is estimated that in 1775, the city of Philadelphia had a population of approximately 35,000 of whom 300 were Jewish. Mikveh Israel counted among its members revolutionary patriots including Jonas Phillips, the Gratz family, and Haym Solomon who financed the war. When Washington was elected president of the United States the Congregation Mickv√© Israel, together with the congregations of New York, Charleston, and Richmond, sent a congratulatory address, to which Washington replied (1790). After Congregation Shearith Israel recalled the Rev. Gershom Mendez Seixas to New York, Congregation Mickv√© Israel elected the Rev. Jacob Raphael Cohen in his stead. The latter had officiated as Chazzan of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue in Montreal and had served in a like capacity in New York during the British occupation. He ministered to the Congregation Mickv√© Israel until his death in Sept., 1811. As a result of the departure of its members, in 1788 the congregation encountered financial difficulties. A subscription list was started to meet the existing debts, and among those who contributed to it were Benjamin Franklin and David Rittenhouse. From this time on the congregation was ceaseless in its religious and charitable activities, and when Isaac Leeser's incumbency began, in 1829, it was, perhaps, the best-known synagogue in the United States. In 1815 Emanuel Nunes Carvalho was elected minister and continued in that capacity until his death in 1817; he was succeeded in 1824 by Abraham Israel Keys. Mikveh Israel erected its first building in 1782 on Cherry Alley, as well as a parsonage, school, mikvah, and oven for Matza baking for Passover. A commemorative marker stands at that place. When the 1782 building became inadequate, the synagogue built a larger synagogue on the same designed by William Strickland, a leading architect. Prior to the Civil War (1861-1865) as the Jewish population grew and prospered, an elegant building was constructed on 7th Street, north of Arch designed by John McArthur Jr. (later, architect of City Hall of Philadelphia). Many Jews moved to the area between Broad and 16th Streets, north of Girard Avenue. A new building was constructed at Broad and York Streets in 1909, flanked by Gratz and Dropsie Colleges. Samuel Elkin and Henry G. Freeman Jr. donated $100,000; $40,500 for the site, $59,000 for the building in memory of Abraham and Eve Elkin. Gratz College, a private, coeducational Jewish college in Melrose Park, Pennsylvania and traces its origins to 1856 when banker, philanthropist and communal leader Hyman Gratz, and the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia (established in 1849 by Rebecca Gratz and Isaac Leeser) joined together to establish a trust to create a Hebrew teachers college. The amount of the endowment was nearly $200,000, worth $6.4 million in 2019. German Immigration and Reform Congregation Rodeph Shalom was founded in 1795, and is the first Ashkenazic congregation established in the Western Hemisphere. In the last decade of the 18th century, a small group of Orthodox Jews from Germany, the Netherlands and Poland formed a minyan to worship in a manner consistent with their shared religious background. At first, services were held in various locations in Olde Philadelphia. In 1866, the congregation built its first sanctuary. Frank Furness, considered the most talented and exciting Philadelphia architect of his time, designed a Moorish-style synagogue on Broad and Mt. Vernon Streets. The congregation soon outgrew its building and replaced it with the current structure, completed in 1928. Inspired by the great synagogue of Florence, Italy, Rodeph Shalom is one of the few synagogues in this country that retains the Byzantine-Moorish style. It was designed by the firm of Simon and Simon, which built the Fidelity Building on Broad Street. The sanctuary seats 1,640 people below star burst skylights. Its stained glass windows are one of the few remaining collections from the renowned D'Ascenzo Studio. The majestic bronze-and-enamel doors of the Torah ark grace the bimah. The D'Ascenzo Studio also designed the sanctuary's walls, ceiling, and dome, along with the carpet and ornamentation. The Broad Street Foyer houses the Leon J. and Julia S. Obermayer Collection of Jewish ritual art. More than 500 objects of Jewish ceremonial art from around the world dating back to the 18th century are on display. The Philadelphia Jewish Museum gallery, dedicated to Jacob Gutman, sponsors three to four exhibits of contemporary Jewish art each year, and is open for public viewing. Keneseth Israel's current building in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania The Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel was organized March 21, 1847. Its first Reader was B. H. Gotthelf, who held services in a hall at No. 528 N Second Street.Sabbath offers serenity in a fast paced world Triblocal.com The Reform movement, which had originated in Germany, soon extended itself to America, and L. Naumberg, Solomon Deutsch, and David Einhorn (1861‚Äì66) furthered its progress in this congregation. The first marked change in the character of the liturgy took place in 1856. Samuel Hirsch succeeded to the rabbinate in 1866; he introduced many changes in the service. In 1887 Joseph Krauskopf was elected rabbi; and contributed much to the success and standing of this congregation.‚ÄòMeaningful Life' course offered in Edwards, www.vaildaily.com It was during his incumbency that the Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel became the largest in Philadelphia. It had about 700 members in 1904. Its synagogue was situated on Broad Street, above Columbia Avenue from 1892 to 1957. In 1893 Joseph Leonard Levy was elected associate rabbi, but he resigned in 1902 to take up a rabbinical position in Pittsburg. The congregation supported a free public library and a reading-room prior to the opening of Philadelphia's Free Library. Senior Rabbis of Keneseth Israel since 1923 when Krauskopf died include William Fineshriber, Bertram W. Korn, Simeon Maslin and Lance J. Sussman. In 1876, in commemoration of the centennial of American Independence, the Order B'nai B'rith and Israelites of America erected in Fairmount Park a statue representing Religious Liberty. It was designed by Moses Ezekiel, and was the first public monument erected by Jews in the United States. In Philadelphia there were in 1904, not including lodges, over 160 Jewish organizations, of which over 50 are synagogues; the remainder consisting of hospitals, foster homes, Sunday-schools, benevolent associations, colleges, young men's Hebrew associations, social clubs, literary societies, etc. (A list of local organizations was published in the \\"American Jewish Year Book\\" for 5661 [1900-1].)  Eastern European Immigration (1881-1924)  In the early years of Eastern European Jewish mass immigration in the 1880s, a size- able Jewish quarter was established in a well-defined area of old Philadelphia, today known as Society Hill and Queen Village. In The Presbyterian, a weekly journal published in Philadelphia in 1889 for the Presbyterian community, the editor wrote: ‚ÄúIn Philadelphia we are likely to have a Jewish section, where emigrants from Eastern Europe will congregate. From Fifth Street to the Delaware River and south of Lombard Street these foreign Jews are crowding in, and being very poor, the Hebrew Charities are drawn upon heavily.‚ÄùThe Presbyterian, Vol. LIX, No. 9, March 2, 1889 (Presbyterian Historical Society). The Jewish press saw a more confined quarter, extending from Spruce Street in the north to Christian Street in the South and from 3rd Street to 6th Street east to west. This was at a time when sweatshops were moving south from Kensington to Northern Liberties and then south of Market Street to Bank and Strawberry Streets. At this time, German- Jewish wholesale clothiers, like Snellenberg's, had their businesses on N. 3rd Street between Market and Arch streets. Many of these buildings stand today.For a listing of the wholesale clothiers and sweatshops on Bank and Strawberry Streets, see Harry D. Boonin, The Jewish Quarter of Philadelphia (JWT of Philadelphia, Inc., 1999), Appendix B. The Society Hachnasath Orechim, or Wayfarers' Lodge, was organized November 16, 1890, and chartered April 29, 1891; it was one of the most active charitable associations in Philadelphia. The Hebrew Literature Society, founded in 1885, opened a new building at 310 Catherine street. The Home for Hebrew Orphans, The Jewish Sheltering Home for the Homeless and Aged, the Mount Sinai Hospital Association, the Pannonia Beneficial Association, and the Central Talmud Torah were all situated in the southern portion of the city. In addition, the newcomers have many social, political, and literary organizations. When immigrant steamers from Liverpool would arrive, trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad backed down onto the piers of the American Line to whisk away immigrants on their journeys to Chicago and places out west. A size-able number of Russian-Jewish immigrants stayed in Philadelphia and settled in the Jewish quarter. Many concentrated around the eastern end of South Street for three primary reasons: rent was inexpensive; housing was near the sweatshops; and the neighborhood was near the Emigrant Depot at the foot of Washington Avenue and the Delaware River. Prior to 1900, few Jews lived south of Washington Avenue. The Jewish Quarter of Philadelphia was bordered by Polish immigrants and Irish to the east, by African-Americans to the west and Italians to the southwest and, to the south, by Irish. Crossing well defined boundaries was dangerous for the immigrants. Curbside and pushcart markets were established; teams of horses flying over cobblestone streets made daily runs to the Dock Street wholesale market. Many Jewish immigrants opened businesses on Dock Street, that continue to operate to the present day including M. Levin & Co, Inc. Central to the new immigrant neighborhood was South Street, called ‚Äúthe great Street for Polish Jews and huckstering of every variety.‚Äù Some writers called it the Russian quarter because so many of the newcomers were from the Imperial Russian Empire.The Life of Michael Valentine Ball (1868-1945), Transcribed and Researched by Edward L. Ball (Warren, PA, June 2003), p. 167. (Privately printed). In 1887, the Public Ledger wrote: ‚ÄúOn South Street many ‚Äúneat‚Äù stores have been built and indications point to the further improvement of that old down-town avenue of retail trade.‚Äù Dock Street, the wholesale food market of its day, ‚Äúis not a handsome street; it is old, full of crude commercial bustle in the hours of the day, and after night fall or in the early hours of the night until the nocturnal preparations for the next day begin, it is almost wholly deserted.‚ÄùRudoph J. Walther, Happenings in Ye Olde Philadelphia (Walther Printing House, Philadelphia, 1925), p. 176, and Dock Street from the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, January 27, 1919, by Penn (William Perrine). The first Yiddish theatre was in the center of the quarter, located at the corner of 5th and Gaskill Streets. It was here that actors of the Yiddish theatre performed, Jacob Adler and Boris Thomashevsky.David B. Tierkel, History of the Yiddish Theatre in Philadelphia, unpublished Yiddish typescript, 1934, Yiddisher Visnshaftlikher Institute, YIVO, New York. In the 1890s, the S. 4th Street vegetable and meat market was started on the sidewalks; it eventually grew into the fabled S. 4th Street pushcart market, still remembered till this day. Markets were located along S. 2nd Street, the Washington Market along Bainbridge Street from 3rd to 5th Streets and in the 4th Street pushcart market. Sweatshops in the quarter numbered over one hundred. On the 300 block of Lombard Street alone there were five sweatshops. After 1900, Jews moved south across Washington Avenue and within just a few years they lived in great numbers south of Washington Avenue and east of Broad Street. Many Jews in the clothing trade prospered during the 1920s and moved to West Philadelphia and Strawberry Mansion. After Congress cut off immigration from Eastern Europe in 1924, the old Jewish quarter began to die out. Although its demise was slowed, first by the Depression and then by the effects of World War II, outward movement from the quarter accelerated after the war ended. Today, there are four synagogues operating in the original Jewish quarter. Two buildings originally built as synagogues‚ÄîCongregation B'nai Abraham, 527 Lombard Street (built in 1910 and still continuing to operate and maintain a congregation), and nearby B‚Äônai Rueben, 6th & Kater Streets (built in 1905 but used for commercial purposes since 1956, and converted residential in 2014) ‚Äîsurvive. B'Nai Abraham Historic Congregation B'Nai Abraham is located in the Society Hill section of Center City Philadelphia, and is supported by a lay led leadership board who act as stewards of the historic building. The congregation was established in 1874 as the \\"Russian Shul\\" following a wave of immigration to the Jewish Quarter of Philadelphia at the time, fleeing from Czar Alexander II. It moved into present space around the 1910s, making it historically significant as the oldest building in Philadelphia that was originally constructed as a synagogue and has been in continuous use as such. With the departure of much of the neighborhood's Jewish population in the mid-twentieth century, the congregation was no longer able to support a full-time rabbi and frequently lacked a minyan for Shabbat services. In the early 21st century, it became affiliated with the Chabad movement and is now one of its two Center City synagogues. Society Hill Synagogue, 418 Spruce Street, renovated and uses the historic building previously home to the Roumanian Shul from 1910 until the 1960s. Congregation Kesher Israel, 412 Lombard Street, acquired the former Universality Church building in 1889 and continues as an active Conservative synagogue. Post World War II In 1964, the Six Million Jewish Martyrs statue, the first public memorial in the United States in remembrance of the Holocaust, was unveiled at 16th Street and Benjamin Franklin Parkway. In 2018, The Horwitz-Wasserman Holocaust Memorial Plaza was unveiled at the same site. In 1976, Mikveh Israel moved to Independence Mall, close to its original site, together with the National Museum of American Jewish History. The building opened on July 4, 1976, the Nation's Bicentennial. In August 2010, the National Museum of American Jewish History moved to new building at 5th and Market Streets. The synagogue is now the sole inhabitant of the current building. The former exhibit space is now the Social Hall, decorated with paintings dating from the 1700s to the present from the Archives. There is also an exhibit in the lobby. (L-R) Rabbis Elya Svei, Aharon Leib Shteinman, Shmuel Kamenetzky =Haredi community= A Haredi community exists in Philadelphia as well.

Literary activity = Books = The earliest publication relating to the Jews published in Philadelphia was a sermon by Moses Mendelssohn delivered by his preceptor David Hirchel Frankel, and translated from the German. It was printed from the press of Andrew Stewart in 1763. The first Hebrew Bible that appeared in the United States was published in Philadelphia in 1814 by Thomas Dobson, the printer being William Fry. = Newspapers = The Occident and American Jewish Advocate was the first Jewish newspaper published in Philadelphia, founded Isaac Leeser in 1843. It was edited by him it until his death in 1868 and for one year thereafter by Mayer Sulzberger. The paper went defunct in 1869. Other now defunct newspapers include The Jewish Index (1872-1873) and The Jewish Record (1975-1886), published under the editorship of Alfred T. Jones. There were several daily papers published in Yiddish in the past, with the most notable being the Jewish Evening Post. The Jewish Exponent was first published on April 15, 1887 and currently serves as the city's sole Jewish newspaper. It is the second oldest Jewish newspaper published today in the United States. = Jewish Federation = Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia headquarters in Jewish Community Services Building From a period immediately after the Revolutionary war efforts have been made to collect money for the charitable organizations by appealing to the general public. Lotteries were held early in the 19th century; subscription lists were constantly being formed. A ball was given in 1843 in aid of three societies. In 1853 and in 1854 dinners were given in aid of the Hebrew Charitable Fund, at which many noted citizens were present. The year following, a ball was given instead of a dinner, and it proved such a success financially that it was thought expedient to continue this form of entertainment; the Hebrew Charity-Ball Association was formed in consequence of this determination, and annual balls were given with great success until 1901, when they were discontinued owing to the establishment of the Federation of Jewish Charities.www.nj.coml As of 2019, The Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia (JFGP) has its headquarters in the Jewish Community Services Building in Center City, Philadelphia.\\"Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia Offices\\" (Archive) Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia. Retrieved on January 19, 2014. \\"Jewish Community Services Building 2100 Arch Street Philadelphia, PA 19103 \\" = United Hebrew Charities = The United Hebrew Charities, a union of six institutions, was organized in 1869, with Simon W. Arnold as its first president. Max Herzberg is president. The combination of the principal charitable societies of Philadelphia was formed on March 17, 1901; Jacob Gimbel was its first president. The federation as originally formed embraced nine institutions‚Äîthe Jewish Hospital Association, Jewish Foster Home, Society of United Hebrew Charities, Hebrew Education Society, Orphans' Guardians, Jewish Maternity Association, Jewish Immigration Society, Young Women's Union, and Hebrew Sunday-School Society. Later, the National Farm School, the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives (at Denver), and the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle became beneficiaries. The income of the Federation (1903) was $123,039, with a membership of 1,916. In 1901, Lewis Elkin bequeathed $2,000,000 (today $) to the city of Philadelphia for the support of superannuated female school-teachers. This is the largest bequest for a charitable object yet made by a Jewish resident of the city. Simon Muhr among other benefactions left a bequest for general educational purposes. The Simon Muhr Work Training School, built in 1899, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. = Association of Jewish Immigrants = In 1882, the great exodus from Russia took place; thousands of Jews forced to emigrate took up their residence in Philadelphia; at the present time they constitute a majority of the Jewish population. A society for the protection of immigrants arriving from the Slavonic provinces was organized October 5, 1884, and called the \\"Association of Jewish Immigrants\\"; Louis E. Levy was president. In 1903, 5,310 Jewish immigrants arrived at the port of Philadelphia. In general, they quickly became prosperous; many had entered the learned professions, and they built synagogues and hospitals in the southern portion of the city, where most of them resided. They had many synagogues and ·∏•ebras, the most important being the Congregation B'nai Abraham, founded in 1882; Bernard Louis Levinthal was rabbi of this and the associated congregations in 1904. = Young Men's Hebrew Association = The Young Men's Hebrew Association, an outgrowth of a former institution‚Äîthe Hebrew Association‚Äîwas organized May 12, 1875, with Mayer Sulzberger as president.

Its building is situated in North Broad street. The Young Women's Union was originally a branch of the Hebrew Education Society, and was organized through the efforts of Mrs. Fanny Binswanger Hoffman on February 5, 1885; the object of the union is to educate the younger children of immigrant Jews. It maintained a kindergarten, day-nursery, sewing-school, etc. Mrs. Julia Friedberger Eschner was president. = Social Clubs = There are several Jewish social organizations.

The last comic published under the imprint featured a May 1988 cover date, although the Star Comics Magazine continued through December 1988. Some of the titles continued after that, being published directly by Marvel. Several of the original titles consciously emulated the house writing and visual style of then-recently defunct Harvey Comics titles such as Richie Rich. The imprint's signature titles were Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham and Heathcliff, its longest running title. The imprint was also known for its Star Wars titles, Droids and Ewoks (based on the animated television series). Artists working on the line include Warren Kremer and Howard Post.Care Bears at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Retrieved April 16, 2006. Archived from the original on April 13, 2012. Background For a number of years the industry had benefited from an \\"age stepladder\\" whereby comics readers could ascend naturally from children's titles by Gold Key Comics (Disney and Looney Tunes licensee) and Harvey, upward to the Archie Comics titles for preteens, and finally graduating to the Marvel and DC titles for teens and older readers or to independent comics. So when Gold Key and other children's comic publishers went out of business, both Marvel and DC began exploring ways to fill that missing step on the reading ladder. In 1983, Gold Key ended its licensed kids' lines. Previously Marvel Comics had never had a successful children's line, although prior to the existence of the Star imprint, they had released a few miniseries based on licensed toy and cartoon properties, such as Rom The Spaceknight, The Smurfs, and Starriors. Marvel launched in 1977 a Hanna-Barbera line including \\"Dynomutt\\". In a one shot, Marvel Tails No. 1, published in 1983 under the Marvel imprint, Spider-Ham debuted. By the early 1980s, Marvel Comics was in negotiations with Harvey Comics to assume publication of some of their characters. Harvey editor Sid Jacobson, along with the other Harvey staff, were interviewed by Mike Hobson, Marvel's group vice-president of publishing (de facto publisher). As part of the process, Jacobson created several new characters which were well received by Hobson and effectively sealed the deal. Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter appointed editor Tom DeFalco as Executive Editor to coordinate with the Harvey staff, who were hired by Marvel. On the day Marvel was set to take over the Harvey publications, Harvey Comics pulled out of the deal due to an internal disagreement among the Harvey brothers. Harvey would cease publishing their comics in 1982. With the loss of the Harvey characters, the Marvel staff reevaluated their publishing plan and decided that their new line of all-age comics would be published under a different imprint name. History Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham #1 one of the first titles published by the imprint. Star Comics was the name selected early on in the revamp of the publishing plan. The first comic published was the first issue of a three issue movie adaptation, The Muppets Take Manhattan, in July 1984 with a stand date of November 1984. After the Star line was launched, several of their existing, ongoing titles which were based on licensed toylines, such as G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and Transformers, remained under the Marvel banner. The regular line did not appear on the stands until five months later and were launched over a two- month period with three original and six licensed titles. Fraggle Rock, Heathcliff, Planet Terry and Strawberry Shortcake were released in the first month while The Ewoks, Get Along Gang, Muppet Babies, Royal Roy and Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham followed in the second month. Top Dog and Wally the Wizard were also early Star original comic titles. In late 1985 Harvey Comics sued Star Comics for copyright infringement, claiming that Royal Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich.\\"Harvey Sues Marvel Star Comics, Charges Copyright Infringement,\\" The Comics Journal #105 (Feb. 1986), pp. 23-24. Thus the title was canceled after six issues due to this similarity. Millie the Model that was started in her own title in 1945, during Marvel's Timely Comics era, and ran until 1973, had a Star Comics spin off (to add to its earlier spin offs) in Misty (the Model) mini-series. In Misty, Millie heads her own modeling agency. Marvel Productions' animated series were sourced for Star Comics titles including Defenders of the Earth and \\"Inhumanoids\\". The lines' two Star Wars titles crossed over in Droids #4 and Ewoks #10. Marvel eventually dissolved the Star imprint, but absorbed several Star titles under the main Marvel banner such as Silverhawks and continued to license new properties, such as Captain Planet. The Star original characters (Top Dog, Planet Terry, Royal Roy and Wally Wizard) later were used in a Marvel Comics series, 2009 X-Babies limited series as antagonists, then Planet Terry was in Drax starting in issue 6 in 2016.

It was created as a result of a directive from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in early October 1999 by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton, to develop an information operations campaign plan against transnational terrorism. According to statements by Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and those of four others, Able Danger had identified 2 of 3 al-Qaeda cells active in the 9/11 attacks; the 'Brooklyn cell' linked to \\"Blind Sheik\\" Omar Abdel-Rahman, including September 11 attacks leader Mohamed Atta, and three of the 9/11 plot's other 19 hijackers. In December 2006, a sixteen-month investigation by the US Senate Intelligence Committee concluded \\"Able Danger did not identify Mohamed Atta or any other 9/11 hijacker at any time prior to September 11, 2001\\", and dismissed other assertions that have fueled 9/11 conspiracy theories. The Senate Judiciary Committee first attempted to investigate the matter for the Senate in September, 2005. The Pentagon \\"ordered five key witnesses not to testify\\", according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter. \\"That looks to me as if it may be obstruction of the committee's activities\\", Specter, R-Pennsylvania, said at the start of his committee's hearing into the unit. Attorney Mark Zaid, representing Lt. Colonel Anthony Shaffer and the other four Able Danger employees at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2005, pointed out to the Committee that his clients had been forbidden by the Pentagon to testify to the Committee. He also discussed the Defense Intelligence Agency's decision to suspend Lt. Colonel Shaffer's security clearance shortly after it became known that he had provided information to the 9/11 Commission on Able Danger. \\"Based on years of experience I can say categorically that the basis for the revocation was questionable at best.\\" An investigation by the Defense Department Inspector General's office (IG) in September 2006 concluded that \\"the evidence did not support assertions that Able Danger identified the September 11, 2001, terrorists nearly a year before the attack, that Able Danger team members were prohibited from sharing information with law enforcement authorities, or that DoD officials acted against LTC Shaffer for his disclosures regarding Able Danger.\\" However, some of the people questioned by the IG claimed their statements to the IG were distorted by investigators in the final IG's report, and the report omitted essential information that they had provided. Lt. Col Tony Shaffer has claimed that the DOD retaliated against him for speaking out publicly about the IG report's distortions. The Senate panel of investigators said there was no evidence DoD lawyers stopped analysts from sharing findings with the FBI before the attacks. Analysts had created charts that included pictures of then-known Al Qaeda operatives, but none including Atta. A follow- up chart made after the attacks did show Atta. The Senate Committee said its findings were consistent with those of the DoD inspector general, released in September 2006. Overview The program used data mining techniques to associate open source information with classified information in an attempt to make connections among individual members of terrorist groups as part of its original \\"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\\". The objective of this particular project was to ascertain whether the data mining techniques and open source material were effective tools in determining terrorist activities, and if the resultant data could be used to create operational plans that could be executed in a timely fashion to interrupt, capture and/or destroy terrorists or their cells.An example of a chart produced as output by the project's data mining and visualization suite is called the 3.21.00 Chart. (DIAC Link Chart declassified 3.21.00, produced on March 21, 2000, and reproduced on author Peter Lance's website for his book Triple Cross Another barely readable sample chart was published by the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office on page 14 of the Able Danger Investigation Report.Patience Wait has reported that a follow-on project appears to have been funded and implemented by the Intelligence Community and was originally named Able Providence. Data Mining Offensive in the Works - Patience Wait - GCN Magazine, 10/10/2005 According to statements by Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and those of four others, Able Danger had identified 2 of 3 Al Qaeda cells active in the 9/11 attacks; the 'Brooklyn cell' linked to Blind Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, including September 11 attacks leader Mohamed Atta, and three of the 9/11 plot's other 19 hijackers, as possible members of an al Qaeda cell linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. This theory was heavily investigated and researched by Republican Representative Curt Weldon, vice chairman of the House Armed Services and House Homeland Security committees. However, Defense Intelligence Agency leadership had already ordered the hurried destruction of mined data, source databases, charts and resultant documents on entirely spurious legal grounds. DIA also prevented key personnel from testifying to both the Senate Judiciary and Senate Intelligence Committees, though after numerous denials did admit the program's existence. In December 2006, an investigation by the US Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that assertions could not be confirmed. It stated that they were unable to find supporting evidence regarding \\"one of the most disturbing claims about the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes.\\" This report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee copied, nearly verbatim, the United States Department of Defense Inspector General's September 2006 report on Able Danger. Assertion that Able Danger identified 9/11 hijackers The existence of Able Danger, and its purported early identification of the 9/11 terrorists, was first disclosed publicly on June 19, 2005, in an article by Keith Phucas, a reporter for The Times Herald, a Norristown, Pennsylvania, daily newspaper. Eight days later, on June 27, 2005, Representative Curt Weldon, vice chairman of the House Armed Services and House Homeland Security committees and the principal source for the Phucas article, gave a special orders speech on the House floor detailing Able Danger: > Mr. Speaker, I rise because information has come to my attention over the > past several months that is very disturbing. I have learned that, in fact, > one of our Federal agencies had, in fact, identified the major New York cell > of Mohamed Atta prior to 9/11; and I have learned, Mr. Speaker, that in > September 2000, that Federal agency actually was prepared to bring the FBI > in and prepared to work with the FBI to take down the cell that Mohamed Atta > was involved in in New York City, along with two of the other terrorists. I > have also learned, Mr. Speaker, that when that recommendation was discussed > within that Federal agency, the lawyers in the administration at that time > said, you cannot pursue contact with the FBI against that cell. Mohamed Atta > is in the U.S. on a green card, and we are fearful of the fallout from the > Waco incident. So we did not allow that Federal agency to proceed.United > States Congress. \\"\\" Congressional Record‚ÄîHouse. Washington, D.C.: GPO, 27 > June 2005. 109th Cong., 1st sess. HR H5244. Rep. Weldon later reiterated these concerns during news conferences on February 14, 2006. He believed that Able Danger identified Mohamed Atta 13 separate times prior to 9/11 and that the unit also identified a potential situation in Yemen two weeks prior to the October 12, 2000 attack on the USS Cole. The Pentagon released a statement in response, stating that they wished to address these issues during a congressional hearing before a House Armed Services subcommittee scheduled for Wednesday, February 15, 2006. =Able Danger and the 9/11 Commission= Curt Weldon's assertion that Able Danger identified the 9/11 hijackers was picked up by the national media in August 2005, after it was reported in the bimonthly Government Security News. In addition to asserting that Able Danger identified the 9/11 hijackers and was prevented from passing that information onto the FBI, Weldon also alleged the intelligence concerning Able Danger was provided to the 9/11 Commission and ignored.United States Congress. \\"\\" Congressional Record‚ÄîHouse. Washington, D.C.: GPO, 27 June 2005. 109th Cong., 1st sess. HR H5250. Retrieved on 2006-08-03. Two 9/11 Commission members, Timothy J. Roemer and John F. Lehman, both claimed not to have received any information on Able Danger. Following the GSN report, members of the 9/11 Commission began commenting on the information they had on Able Danger and Atta. Lee H. Hamilton, former Vice Chair of the 9/11 Commission, and Al Felzenberg, a former spokesman for the 9/11 Commission, both denied that the 9/11 Commission had any information on the identification of Mohamed Atta prior to the attacks. Hamilton told the media, \\"The Sept. 11 commission did not learn of any U.S. government knowledge prior to 9/11 of surveillance of Mohamed Atta or of his cell.... Had we learned of it obviously it would've been a major focus of our investigation.\\" On August 12, 2005, Hamilton and former 9/11 Commission chairman Thomas Kean issued a statement in response to media inquiries about the Commission's investigation of the Able Danger program. It stated the Commission had been aware of the Able Danger program, and requested and obtained information about it from the Department of Defense, but none of the information provided had indicated the program had identified Atta or other 9/11 hijackers. They further stated that a claim about Atta having been identified prior to the attacks had been made to the 9/11 Commission on July 12, 2004 (just days before the Commission's report was released), by a United States Navy officer employed at DOD, but that > The interviewee had no documentary evidence and said he had only seen the > document briefly some years earlier. He could not describe what information > had led to this supposed Atta identification. Nor could the interviewee > recall, when questioned, any details about how he thought a link to Atta > could have been made by this DOD program in 2000 or any time before 9/11. > The Department of Defense documents had mentioned nothing about Atta, nor > had anyone come forward between September 2001 and July 2004 with any > similar information. Weighing this with the information about Atta's actual > activities, the negligible information available about Atta to other U.S. > government agencies and the German government before 9/11, and the > interviewer's assessment of the interviewee's knowledge and credibility, the > Commission staff concluded that the officer's account was not sufficiently > reliable to warrant revision of the report or further investigation. Congressman Curt Weldon issued a response to the 9/11 Commission clarifying the mission of Able Danger, expressing concern over the statements made by various members of the 9/11 Commission, and promising to push forward until it is understood why the DoD was unable to pass the information uncovered by Able Danger to the FBI, and why the 9/11 Commission failed to follow up on the information they were given on Able Danger. > The 9/11 Commission has released multiple statements over the past week, > each of which has significantly changed ‚Äì from initially denying ever being > briefed to acknowledging being briefed on both operation ABLE DANGER and > Mohamed Atta. The information was omitted primarily because they found it to > be suspect despite having been briefed on it two times by two different > military officers on active duty. Additionally, the 9/11 Commission also > received documents from the Department of Defense on ABLE DANGER. Congressman Weldon reiterated these statements in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 21, 2005. =Able Danger data destroyed= In his book Countdown to Terror, Weldon asserted that an Able Danger chart produced in 1999 identifying 9/11 hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi had been presented to then-Deputy National Security Advisor Jim Steinberg. Weldon went on to claim that he had personally presented the chart to then-Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley in 2001, days after the 9/11 attacks. He later stated that he was no longer sure that Atta's name appeared on that document. Congressman Peter Hoekstra, who was then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, investigated the matter at Weldon's request, was reported to have cautioned against \\"hyperventilating\\" before the completion of a \\"thorough\\" probe. Pentagon officials said they were unaware that any Able Danger material named Atta. They declined to comment on the reports as they worked to clarify the matter. On August 14, 2005, Mike Kelly, a columnist for The (Bergen) Record (New Jersey), described a telephone interview, arranged by the staff of Rep. Curt Weldon, with a man who identified himself as a member of the Able Danger team, but asked that his name not be revealed. In the interview, the man claimed his team had identified Mohamed Atta and three other 9/11 hijackers as likely Al-Qaeda terrorists operating in the United States, but were prevented from passing this information on to the FBI by government lawyers. He also claimed he was ignored by the 9/11 Commission's staff when he approached them on two occasions to explain Able Danger's work. On September 15, 2005, Weldon asserted that he had identified an employee who had been ordered to destroy the 2.5 terabytes (TB) of data collected by Able Danger two years before the 9/11 attack. Weldon changes his story A Time magazine article dated August 14, 2005, reports that Weldon admitted he is no longer sure that Atta's name was on the chart he presented to Hadley and that he was unable to verify whether this was the case, having handed over his only copy, and that a reconstruction was used for post-9/11 presentations. Weldon gave a talk at the Heritage Foundation with a chart he described as the one handed over on May 23, 2002. However, a week later he referred reporters to a recently reconstructed version of the chart in his office where, among dozens of names and photos of terrorists from around the world, there was a color mug shot of Mohammad Atta, circled in black marker. Comments by members of the Able Danger team = Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer = After Weldon's assertions were disputed, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, a member of the Able Danger team, identified himself as Weldon's source. Shaffer claimed that he alerted the FBI in September 2000 about the information uncovered by the secret military unit \\"Able Danger\\", but he alleges three meetings he set up with bureau officials were blocked by military lawyers. Shaffer, who at the time worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, claims he communicated to members of the 9/11 Commission that Able Danger had identified two of the three cells responsible for 9/11 prior to the attacks, but the Commission did not include this information in their final report. Shaffer specifically states that in January 2000, Able Danger data-mining revealed the existence of a 'Brooklyn' Al-Qaeda cell connected to the \\"Blind Sheik\\" Omar Abdel-Rahman, as well as two other cells overseas. Shaffer & Philpott examined this chart of Al Qaeda suspected operatives, containing names & photos, and Philpott pointed out one particular sinister and \\"scary looking dude\\" -- Mohammed Atta. Shaffer's lawyer, Mark Zaid, has revealed that Shaffer had been placed on paid administrative leave for what he called \\"petty and frivolous\\" reasons and had his security clearance suspended in March 2004, following a dispute over travel mileage expenses and personal use of a work cell phone. Congressman Weldon asked for a new probe into the activities undertaken to silence Lt. Col. Shaffer from publicly commenting on Able Danger and Able Danger's identification of the 9/11 hijackers. Weldon called the activities \\"a deliberate campaign of character assassination.\\" Shaffer has also told the story of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) opposition to Able Danger, prior to 9/11, based on the view that Able Danger was encroaching on CIA turf. According to Shaffer, the CIA representative said, \\"I clearly understand. We're going after the leadership. You guys are going after the body. But, it doesn't matter. The bottom line is, CIA will never give you the best information from \\"Alex Base\\" or anywhere else. CIA will never provide that to you because if you were successful in your effort to target Al Qaeda, you will steal our thunder. Therefore, we will not support this.\\" =Navy Captain Scott Phillpott= Capt. Scott Phillpott confirmed Shaffer's claims. \\"I will not discuss this outside of my chain of command\\", Phillpott said in a statement to Fox News. \\"I have briefed the Department of the Army, the Special Operations Command and the office of (Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence) Dr. Cambone as well as the 9/11 Commission. My story has remained consistent. Atta was identified by Able Danger in January/February 2000\\", he was quoted as saying. =James D. Smith= Shaffer's claims were also confirmed by James D. Smith, a civilian contractor who worked on Able Danger. In an interview with Fox News, Smith reported that the project had involved analysis of data from a large number of public sources and 20 to 30 individuals. Smith stated that Atta's name had emerged during an examination of individuals known to have ties to Omar Abdel Rahman, a leading figure in the first World Trade Center bombing. =Major Erik Kleinsmith= Major Erik Kleinsmith, who was with the Army and chief of intelligence for LIWA until February 2001, testified that he was ordered to destroy Able Danger's information. \\"I deleted the data\\", he said. \\"There were two sets, classified and unclassified, and also an 'all sorts, which contained a blend of the two, \\"plus charts we'd produced.\\" Kleinsmith deleted the 2.5 terabytes of data in May and June, 2000, on orders of Tony Gentry, general counsel of the Army Intelligence and Security Command. =Other witnesses= The Defense Department announced its findings on September 1, 2005, after a three-week investigation into Able Danger. The statement announced the discovery of three other witnesses in addition to Shaffer and Phillpott who confirm Able Danger had produced a chart that \\"either mentioned Atta by name as an al-Qaeda operative [and/or] showed his photograph.\\" Four of the five witnesses remember the photo on the chart. The fifth remembers only Atta being cited by name. The Pentagon describes the witnesses as \\"credible\\" but stated that the document which allegedly mentioned Atta could not be found. The wall Former chief assistant U.S. attorney Andrew McCarthy and others have asserted that the Able Danger intelligence was suppressed as a result of a policy of forbidding the CIA and FBI to share intelligence known as \\"the wall.\\" During the 9/11 Commission hearings, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft testified the wall was strengthened under the Clinton administration by Jamie Gorelick to prohibit sharing of terrorist intelligence within the federal government. This assertion was disputed by former senator Slade Gorton (R-WA), a member of the 9-11 Commission, who said, \\"nothing Jamie Gorelick wrote had the slightest impact on the Department of Defense or its willingness or ability to share intelligence information with other intelligence agencies.\\" Gorton also asserted that \\"the wall\\" was a long-standing policy that had resulted from the Church Committee in the 1970s, and that the policy only prohibits transfer of certain information from prosecutors to the intelligence services and never prohibited information flowing in the opposite direction. Skepticism =Two Attas theory= Mickey Kaus of Slate.com, referring to Tom Maguire's \\"Two Attas\\" theory, speculates that \\"the 'Atta' fingered by Able Danger was really the first, 'Abu Nidal' Atta, and not the second, 9/11 'Al Qaeda' Atta\\", and that this may help explain this Able Danger issue. Snopes.com clarified a widely circulated email that claimed the two Attas were one and the same. Another variation of the Two Attas theory reported by Kaus notes that Omar Abdel Rahman also had an associate with the name Mohamed El-Amir (a name sometimes used by Atta) who was not the Mohamed Atta involved in the 9/11 hijacking. However, Shaffer clarified that. He told 9/11 Commission staffers Able Danger identified three of the individuals in the terrorist cells that conducted the 9/11 attacks, to include Atta - Shaffer did not mention the names of any other of the 9/11 hijackers in his disclosure to the 9/11 staff. A fourth 9/11 terrorist came from the second cell. Eric Umansky states the problem this way: \\"In fact, the two-Atta theory only leaves one major issue unexplained: What about the three other 9/11 hijackers that Able Danger purportedly fingered? The Department of Defense released a report addressing the issue of two possible individuals with the last name of Atta and explaining that it was basically a clerical error. > When we reviewed INS records, they appeared to reflect two entries by Atta > into the United States on January 10, 2001, which initially raised a > question as to whether Atta had entered twice on the same day or whether a > second person posing as Atta also entered on January 10, 2001. The NIIS > printout for the first entry reflects that Atta entered with an admission > period of January 10, 2001, to September 8, 2001 (admission number > 68653985708).

IG report is disputed by Lt. Col. Shaffer and other Able Danger team members, some of whom were never interviewed by the IG's office nor the 9/11 commission. Congressman Weldon also claims the report was a hurried, botched up investigation that was intended to close the books on the subject rather than report on the facts. For example this lead was never followed: \\"Normen Pentolino, operations manager at the Hollywood store, said two cashiers told FBI agents they might have recognized Atta, but weren't certain. Sources inside the store said Atta may have held a BJ's membership card for more than two years.\\" =Timing= Kevin Drum, writing for The Washington Monthly notes that reports of the precise date at which the information was allegedly passed to the FBI vary considerably. It is most unlikely that Able Danger would have identified a terrorist called \\"Mohamed Atta\\" before May 2000. > Since 9/11, of course, we have retrieved every scrap of information ever > known about Mohamed Atta, so we know what information would have been > available to the Able Danger data mining operation.

Congressional hearings Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter held a hearing on September 21, 2005, looking into the facts about Able Danger. However, Lt. Col. Shaffer and the other four members of Able Danger were ordered not to testify by the Department of Defense. Senator Specter decided to go forward with the hearings anyway. Senator Specter wondered if the Posse Comitatus Act may have been the reason Defense Department attorneys would not allow Able Danger to turn over information to the FBI. The Posse Comitatus Act prevents the military from being engaged in law enforcement activities, including gathering information on U.S. persons, despite the aliens were not specifically United States citizens. Speaking on behalf of Lt. Col. Shaffer, attorney Mark Zaid testified \\"Those within Able Danger were confident they weren't compiling information on US persons. They were potentially people connected to US persons.\\" Zaid also strongly asserted on behalf of his clients, > \\"Let me emphasize two specific items for clarification purposes because they > have been distorted and invited undue criticism from some. At no time did > Able Danger identify Mohamed Atta as being physically present in the United > States. No information obtained at the time would have led anyone to believe > criminal activity had taken place or that any specific terrorist activities > were being planned.

The copies that would have > been in the possession of the U.S. Army were apparently destroyed by March > 2001.

The question for this Committee is > to investigate how far that position extends and why.\\" Former Army Major Erik Kleinsmith, former head of the Pentagon's Land Warfare Analysis Department, testified at the hearing that he had been instructed to destroy data and documents related to Able Danger in May and June 2000. When asked whether the information could have prevented the attack on September 11 of 2001, he answered that he would not speculate to that, but that the information might have been useful. Subsequent investigations On February 14, 2006, Congressmen Curt Weldon charged that contrary to testimony, not all the data on Able Danger had been destroyed. Weldon claimed to be in contact with people in the government still able to do data-mining who got 13 hits on Mohamed Atta. Weldon also claimed that Able Danger information was found in Pentagon files as recently as two weeks prior to his statement and that a general was present when the files were taken from the cabinet. The next day, there was a joint committee meeting with the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional Threats and Capabilities and the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, to discuss the Able Danger program. On September 21, 2006, The Washington Post reported that a Defense Department investigation into Able Danger found that Able Danger did not identify Mohamed Atta or any other hijacker before the September 11 attacks, and that a widely discussed chart was \\"a sample document passed to the military as an example of how to organize large amounts of data\\", and was created after 9/11. =Inspector General's report= On September 18, 2006, the Office of the Deputy Inspector General for Investigations released a report stating that Shaffer was put on leave, that the crew responsible for removing any classified documents from his office to prevent his taking them home with him found that he did not have any of the Able Danger-related documents trusted to him he claimed he had, and that despite the fact that the Army cleared him of any wrongdoing in the allegations \\"DIA officials would have taken action to revoke LTC Shaffer's access and clearance regardless of his disclosures to the DIA IG, the 9/11 Commission staff members, Members of Congress, or the media. The Department of Defense investigation concluded: * The anti-terrorist program, Able Danger, did not identify Mohamed Atta or any other 9/11 terrorists before the 9/11 attack. * Able Danger members were not prohibited from sharing intelligence information with law enforcement authorities or other agencies that could have acted on that information. In fact, Able Danger produced no actionable intelligence information. * The destruction of Able Danger documentation at LIWA and Garland was appropriate and complied with applicable DoD regulations. * The Able Danger program was not terminated prematurely. It concluded after it had achieved its objective and its work products were used in follow-on intelligence gathering efforts at USSOCOM.\\" Alleged evidence of IG cover- up Five witnesses who had worked on Able Danger and had been questioned by the Defense Department's Inspector General later told investigative journalists that their statements to the IG were distorted by investigators in the final IG's report, or the report omitted essential information that they had provided. The alleged distortions of the IG report centered around excluding any evidence that Able Danger had identified and tracked Atta years before 9/11. The witnesses reported to the journalists that the IG investigators got increasingly hostile in an effort to intimidate the witnesses into changing their testimony to drop any assertion that they had identified and tracked Atta, and this suggests a cover-up by the IG of Able Danger's findings. Witnesses reported telling Philip Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, that Able Danger had identified Atta well before the 9/11 attacks, but Zelikow showed no interest in their testimony. Lt. Col Tony Shaffer also reported that the DOD has retaliated against him for speaking out publicly about the IG report's distortions. Movie The independent film Able Danger was released in 2008. The screenplay written by Paul Krik centers around a Brooklyn, New York coffee shop owner who receives a disk proving a tie between the CIA and the 9/11 attacks.Review by the Los Angeles Times October 31, 2008 Book Operation Dark Heart by Anthony A. Shaffer, released in September 2010, includes memories of his time reporting to the 9/11 commission about Able Danger's findings. The 10,000 copies of the books have not been released yet. The DOD's Defense Intelligence Agency reviewers identified more than 200 passages suspected of containing classified information.NYT September 10, 2010 \\"Specifically, the DIA wanted references to a meeting between Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, the book's author, and the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, Philip Zelikow, removed\\".Fox News September 10, 2010 DOD took the highly unusual step of purchasing all available copies of Shaffer's book at a cost of $47,000 and destroying them to deny the public the ability to read the book.

He played in the first-ever Test match, scoring England's first Test fifty. Life and career =Early cricket career= Jupp was born in Dorking, Surrey, and played his earliest cricket for the Wellesley House club in Twickenham.Brief profile of Henry Jupp by Don Ambrose at Cricket Archive Despite not having any experience of first-class cricket took his place in a strong Surrey eleven that was to beat the best of the rest of England in 1864 by nine wickets.Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A‚ÄìZ of Cricket Records; p. 53. With Thomas Humphrey, he formed Surrey's first strong opening partnership. Renowned for his defensive technique, Jupp was known as \\"Young Stonewaller\\" after the \\"Old Stonewaller\\" Will Mortlock,‚ÄúHenry Jupp‚Äù; in Australian Town and Country Journal; 1 June 1889; p. 41 and was sometimes criticised for not punishing bad ballsGrace, William Gilbert, ‚ÄúForty Years of Cricket‚Äù; in The Sydney Mail; 18 June 1890 but he had superb back play which was essential on the unrolled wickets which predominated in the early part of his career. Jupp also managed to develop a very strong cut and drive as time went by,‚ÄúThe Coming English Cricketers: The Professionals‚Äù; in Empire; 13 January 1874; p. 4 and was also a fine outfield who frequently served as a long stop and occasionally kept wicket when Pooley was absent. Although Surrey's champion 1860s team collapsed so badly that by 1871 Surrey had become so weak as to win none of thirteen county games, and their batting depth declined to the point of almost total dependence on Jupp, the erratic Humphrey brothers and Ted Pooley,Baily's Magazine of Sports & Pastimes, Volume 17 (1869) this did not affect Jupp's ability. Harry Jupp first scored 1,000 runs in 1866, in which year he hit 165 against Lancashire, and toured North America in 1868. He reached four figures every year from 1869 to 1874. In 1874 he achieved the feat of carrying his bat through both innings of a match against Yorkshire, a feat equalled in England only by Sep Kinneir, Cecil Wood, Vijay MerchantWebber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 109. Published 1951 by Playfair Books. and Jimmy Cook. The previous winter he had participated in the first English tour of Australia. Outside of cricket, Jupp was originally a bricklayer, and became a pub landlord in 1875. In that same year, his first wife died and he remarried a woman named Rose. In the 1875 season Jupp scored less than half as many runs as in 1874, and despite touring with James Lillywhite‚Äôs side in 1876-77 and playing in the matches that became known as the first two Test matches, his batting never again reached the heights of 1874. =The first Test= In the first-ever Test series that took place from March to April 1877 Harry Jupp was England's opening batsman. In the First Test England lost the toss and were made to field. After toiling in the field for a day and a half he became England's first Test batsman as he faced a first ball from Australian opening bowler John Hodges. Jupp went on to make only the second test fifty (Charles Bannerman of Australia had made 165 in the first innings) and finished on 63, the second-best individual score of the match. =Later life= In 1881, he was given a benefit match between the North and South at The Oval, but declined so badly that year that his best score in fourteen innings was 20 and he dropped out of the Surrey team after the August Bank Holiday. A benefit match was played every year at Dorking for him after this.North Otago Times, 27 March 1891, p. 3 After he retired as a player, Jupp was an umpire until 1888 and the professional to the Lymington Cricket Club in 1883.Paton, Graeme; ‚ÄúCricket club faces eviction amid fears over flying balls‚Äù; in The Telegraph, 20 November 2011 Jupp died in Bermondsey, London. He was buried at Nunhead, where his gravestone can be found in the undergrowth of the extreme SW corner of the cemetery.

Designed in 1947 and raced until 1954‚Äì55, it produced at 12,000 rpm, although test figures from Rolls-Royce suggested that the engine would be able to be run at up to 14,000rpm. The very complex engine was exceptionally powerful for the time, but it initially proved a disappointment, possessing poor reliability so that cars either did not start or failed to finish races. In the 1952 Formula One season, after BRM withdrew their V16 engined cars before a race in Turin while attempting to enlist Juan Manuel Fangio, leaving only Ferrari as the main contestants with no effective competition, the racing organisers abandoned the Formula One series and ran the remaining year's races as Formula Two. Development The engine was designed by a team consisting of Peter Berthon, Harry Mundy, Eric Richter, and Frank May. It was conceived as basically two 750cc V8 engines back-to-back with cam drives and gears in the centre of the engine. Components were manufactured by various British companies, including English Steel ‚Äì the crankshaft, Standard Motors ‚Äì machining of the main engine components, sump, etc., and David Brown ‚Äì the gears. Eventually there were around 350 companies that provided support to the project, including Rolls-Royce, which designed, manufactured and tested the two-stage centrifugal supercharger. The firm also developed the flame traps for the inlet manifold, used to prevent the highly compressed fuel/air mixture from exploding in a backfire. The traps were a first on a car engine, reflecting the supercharger's extremely limited use in automobiles, but had become a necessity on high-powered piston aero engines such as the Merlin and Griffon. Twin-pot carburettors were designed for the engine by SU. bonnet The chassis of the BRM Type 15 car designed for the engine was made by Rubery Owen. The gearbox was designed by Mundy based on the one from the German pre- war 1939 1.5 litre V8 Mercedes-Benz W165 car: part of BRM's ethos was to exploit German technology that had so recently been used against Britain during World War II. Cameron Earl had visited Germany to retrieve any relevant documents. Rear suspension of the new BRM was also derived from Mercedes-Benz, and trailing arm front suspension from Auto Union. Girling provided special three-leading-shoe drum brakes for the car and the springing and shock absorbers were Lockheed air-struts incorporating silicon oil/air pocket adjustable springing/damping on all four wheels. The body panels and styling of the car were designed by Walter Belgrove of Standard Motors. Design of the car and all engineering drawings had been completed by the Spring of 1947. In many cases parts were produced in the form of donations to the BRM team by the respective companies, which had the advantage of reducing BRM's spending. However, many parts were produced only when suppliers had spare capacity and so were delayed, and because the parts were donated BRM were unable to expedite delivery. Because of this, the engine itself was late. Some completed components did not arrive at BRM for assembly until May 1949, reducing time available for testing before the start of the first season's racing. The completed car was first run on the aerodrome at RAF Folkingham in December 1949, driven by Raymond Mays, who was suffering from a high fever at the time. The use of Folkingham was the British Government's sole contribution to the project. Races It had been intended to d√©but the car at the 1950 Formula One Grand Prix race at Silverstone, the first race of the new Formula One World Championship, but problems with the engine, such as cylinders cracking, buckling of connecting rods, and piston failures, led to the postponement of the race d√©but. BRM instead had to settle for displaying the car at Silverstone after the BRM mechanics had worked all the previous night to get the car ready. Mays drove the car for several laps. The demonstration was witnessed by Princess Elizabeth, later Elizabeth II, and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The car was first entered in a race at the August 1950 Daily Express non-Championship race at Silverstone. The one car that the team had been able to prepare was flown from Folkingham into Silverstone on the morning of the race. It had missed the practice sessions but, after three proving laps driven by Frenchman Raymond Sommer, was allowed to start from the back of the grid. When the flag dropped at the start of the race, the BRM, carrying the racing number 8, merely lurched forward and then stopped, engine screaming, with Sommer unable to get any drive. The car was pushed over to the side of the track and withdrawn. One or both inboard universal joints had failed.Nye, Doug (2003). BRM: Front Engined Cars, 1945‚Äì1960. Volume 1. Motor Racing Publications. . This was perceived as a particularly unfortunate event for the car and British Racing Motors as the Daily Express newspaper had produced a glossy brochure about the new car, and the failure of the BRM at the race is considered to have somewhat coloured people's perception of the car ever since. The next outing was a short sprint event at Goodwood in September of that year. Reg Parnell won two races, including the Goodwood Trophy, despite being unable to use all the car's power due to the poor weather and wet circuit. After the fiasco of Silverstone, the two wins demonstrated that the car could actually go and had tremendous speed and acceleration. Parnell said in a news interview after the races; \\"All we need now is a little longer time to develop it and then we hope to show the Continent what we really can do\\". In subsequent races Peter Walker drove a second car, and in July 1951 BRM was able to enter two cars for the 1951 British Grand Prix. During the race the two drivers suffered from extreme heat in the cockpit because the exhaust pipes were routed inside the bodywork. This problem had not been so troublesome in earlier, shorter, races. During one of two pit stops, Parnell and Walker had to wrap burn dressings around their legs to provide insulation from the heat, together with limiting the revs to 10,500rpm to reduce the cockpit temperature to a tolerable level. Despite this, and starting from the back of the field, Parnell finished 5th, with Walker 7th. Later the team went to Monza, intending to run two cars in the 1951 Italian Grand Prix to be driven by Parnell and Walker, after prospective driver Ken Richardson was vetoed by the RAC. However gearbox trouble in one car led to Berthon, anticipating a similar problem in the other, withdrawing both cars. Disappointed, Mays' team returned home, but one car was able to remain at Monza for further testing due to the generosity of the track's owners, who allowed the team to run the car on the circuit and use the circuit's facilities at no charge. The car was the first Grand Prix car to use disc brakes: Girling created a set of special brakes for the car which were tested in late 1951 while still at Monza. In 1952 Stirling Moss came to BRM to work on testing the car, with the possibility of racing it. He drove one of two BRMs in the 1952 Ulster Trophy but had problems with his car during the start. Both cars failed to finish and the race was won by Piero Taruffi driving a Ferrari. Later in 1952, BRM entered three cars in a race at Goodwood; the cars finished first, second and third. In the same year Alfa Romeo, one of the leading players in the sport, stated that they might not participate in further Grands Prix, leaving only two major teams, Ferrari and a temporarily uncompetitive Maserati. The race organisers of Formula One wondered who could take Alfa Romeo's place. Ferrari had built new cars for the 1952 season and BRM was then asked if it would be entering cars. BRM replied by preparing two cars for an April race at Valentino Park, Turin, one drum- braked car, and the other disc-braked, with Moss as one driver, and with Mays all the while attempting to enlist Fangio, who had until recently been driving for Alfa Romeo, as the other. This Mays succeeded in doing, but this meant missing the Turin race. Fangio came to Folkingham to test the car. At this point the BRM V16 was developing around 400‚Äì450 hp. As soon as he got in the car, Fangio seemed to take to the vehicle, driving the car with his usual √©lan. It was stated that all the drivers who had driven the car prior to Fangio had been in awe of it. Meanwhile, at the missed Turin race, Ferraris had finished in the first six places, prompting the race organisers to abandon BRM as their hope of providing any real competition for Ferrari in Formula One, and instead run the remaining season's races as Formula Two events. Thus, by not competing in the Turin race, BRM contributed to the downfall of the Formula for which the car had been built. In the middle of 1952 the cars were substantially rebuilt, including better cooling ‚Äì most notably a greatly enlarged radiator aperture in the nose, better ventilation, and repositioning of the exhaust pipe stubs. The car had been deliberately designed with a low seating position, but Fangio, asked what changes he would like on the car, replied that amongst other things he would like a little higher seat, as he liked to see where he was going. The car was modified to Fangio's request and he drove the car intermittently throughout 1953. He later said that it was the most formidable car he ever drove during his career. At this stage the engines were developing more than 500 hp, touching 600 hp, albeit with a very peaky power curve. This power curve had been forecast by Rolls-Royce who had recommended that inter-stage throttling of the supercharger be incorporated to provide a curve more suited to road use. Berthon considered the addition an unnecessary complication, and this, and the alternative variable-angle stators at the supercharger's inlet - both used initially on the two-stroke Crecy - which had been developed and tested by Rolls-Royce for the engine, were not proceeded with. After a particularly trying time with reliability problems during a 1952 race at Ulster, Fangio was asked if he would ever drive the BRM again. He replied; \\"I will. I consider it to be, basically, the best Formula One car ever made. All it needs is improvement in certain details. No car has ever given me such a thrill to drive, or a greater sense of absolute mastery. I will stand by it\\". Unfortunately for both Fangio and BRM, the following day, tired after an overnight drive from Folkingham across Europe to Monza for a race, he crashed while driving for Maserati, breaking his neck, and retired from racing to recover until early 1953. After Fangio's accident at Monza, Mays, looking around for a replacement driver, auditioned Mike Hawthorn, who drove the car at Folkingham but later complained: \\"It was no use ‚Äì every time I came to a corner and went below the 8,000rpm mark, the power went right off. Then, suddenly, as you reached the 8,000 mark the full power would come in and you had a job to hold the car straight. At 8,000rpm it really did motor, but the steering was nothing to write home about\\". Hawthorn went on to drive a Ferrari for Tony Vandervell instead. In the meantime, the car was raced by Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez and Ken Wharton, who was one of BRM's own test drivers.http://www.veloce.co.uk/shop/graphics/pdf/V4037.pdf At around this time the trust that managed BRM decided that they had gone as far as they could with the car and decided to put the assets up for sale. The best offer came from the Rubery Owen Group and Alfred Owen, who, despite the trying times with the car, had remained loyal to the project. In this period the team missed an opportunity to move the entire effort to the Midlands where, due to the prevalence of British motor companies, the team would have benefited from greater and more convenient technical and engineering support. Instead the team remained at The Maltings at Bourne. Also in 1953, the BRM had a moment of glory at Albi. Three cars were entered in a sprint race specifically for Formula One cars. Driven by a now-recovered Fangio, Gonz√°lez and Wharton, their main competitor was a works' Ferrari driven by Alberto Ascari. Fangio went on to win a heat race in spectacular fashion, although Wharton had a bad crash and did not finish. In addition, the BRMs had also suffered from tyre problems. Ascari later commented that with all the noise produced by the BRMs he had been almost unable to hear anything else while driving. This race is regarded as showing what Formula One could have been like had it been continued into 1953. During the race Fangio's car's V16 ran at a claimed 72 psi boost (4.9 ata) and 585 bhp (436 kW) at 11,800 rpm, the car reaching 186 mph (300 km/h). At around this time Tony Rudd, who had by then joined BRM after his previous period of secondment from Rolls-Royce, suggested that they build a lightweight, short-wheelbase, version of the car for this sort of race, and this subsequently became the Mark II or Type 30. Two were built; the first used components from the wreck of Wharton's car damaged at Albi. Rudd was thinking of chasing the Class F Record with the car, and asked his former employers what they thought the engine was capable of if tuned for all-out speed for only a few miles. Rudd stated that Rolls-Royce replied; \\"They said it would pull 800hp with all the goodies and 1,000hp with a sprint fuel\\". However, the attempt on the record was never made. Amongst the other drivers, the Type 15 Mark II/Type 30 was also driven by Ron Flockhart. The cars were raced in 1954 and 1955 while BRM worked on a car for the new Formula One specification of 2.5 litres un-supercharged. By this time the V16-powered cars were running quite reliably, but the demise of the Formula around which they had been based prevented the Mark II cars from making a greater impact. The cars last raced around the end of 1955. One of the later drivers was Peter Collins, who, Owen thought, was the only driver other than Fangio who showed the BRM Type 15/Type 30 to its best advantage.Ludvigsen, Karl (2008) [2006]. BRM V16. Veloce. The potential of the engine was illustrated in 1968 when Graham Hill drove the car in a demonstration in South Africa, the car being fitted with the original, larger, Rolls-Royce supercharger inlet. Hill revved the engine to 13,000rpm, at which point Rudd thought the engine would have been producing around 780 bhp. Fangio's opinion on the BRM Type 15/Type 30 was; \\"It was the most fantastic car I ever drove ‚Äì an incredible challenge in every way.\\" Results The engine was powerful and the car was fast. Reliability, at least early on, was not adequate: the engine suffered from water leaks into the cylinders, due to the use of a separate head/block assembly. (Most previous supercharged car engines used a combined unit). The V16 head-block union was unable to survive the high pressures involved, leading to warping and lifting of the head. * Number of Grands Prix 4 * Number of starts 2 * Number of finishes 2 * Number of finishes in points 1 After the fiasco of the Ulster Trophy in June 1952, where both BRM V16-powered Type 15's failed to finish, Stirling Moss wrote to Raymond Mays telling him that he did not want to drive the car in the state that it was in, given its lack of reliability. Conclusion Although reliability was a problem during the car's brief Formula One career, the car and engine went on to become quite reliable after the initial problems had been worked out. Unfortunately this did not occur until after the Formula the car had been designed for had been abandoned. The cars themselves contributed to the changing of the Formula due to Mays' withdrawal of the cars at Turin in 1952. By the time the reliability problems had been solved the car had nowhere to race in the Formula it was intended for. A total of four Type 15s were produced, one of which was written off by a collision during the Glover Trophy and salvaged for spares, while another car that crashed at Albi was used as the basis for one of the two P30s produced. One Type 15 is on display at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, the other is on display as part of the Donington Grand Prix Exhibition in its original light green paint scheme alongside a P30 and a cutaway V16 engine. The fourth surviving car, another P30, is in the ownership of Bernie Ecclestone, having previously been owned by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. The cars can sometimes be seen in action at the various historic racing events such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

They are related to the Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, and Thaumaleidae. Over 2,200 species of black flies have been formally named, of which 15 are extinct. They are divided into two subfamilies: Parasimuliinae contains only one genus and four species; Simuliinae contains all the rest. Over 1,800 of the species belong to the genus Simulium. Most black flies gain nourishment by feeding on the blood of mammals, including humans, although the males feed mainly on nectar. They are usually small, black or gray, with short legs, and antennae. They are a common nuisance for humans, and many U.S. states have programs to suppress the black fly population. They spread several diseases, including river blindness in Africa (Simulium damnosum and S. neavei) and the Americas (S. callidum and S. metallicum in Central America, S. ochraceum in Central and South America).  Ecology  Eggs are laid in running water, and the larvae attach themselves to rocks. Breeding success is highly sensitive to water pollution. The larvae use tiny hooks at the ends of their abdomens to hold on to the substrate, using silk holdfasts and threads to move or hold their place. They have foldable fans surrounding their mouths. The fans expand when feeding, catching passing debris (small organic particles, algae, and bacteria). The larva scrapes the fan's catch into its mouth every few seconds. Black flies depend on lotic habitats to bring food to them. They will pupate under water and then emerge in a bubble of air as flying adults. They are often preyed upon by trout during emergence. The larva of some South African species are known to be phoretic on mayfly nymphs. A female black fly Adult males feed on nectar, while females exhibit anautogeny and feed on blood before laying eggs. Some species in Africa can range as far as from aquatic breeding sites in search of their blood meals, while other species have more limited ranges. Different species prefer different host sources for their blood meals, which is sometimes reflected in the common name for the species. They feed in the daytime, preferably when wind speeds are low. Black flies may be either univoltine or multivoltine, depending on the species. The number of generations a particular pest species has each year tends to correlate with the intensity of human efforts to control those pests. Work conducted at Portsmouth University in 1986‚Äì1987 indicates Simulium spp. create highly acidic conditions within their midguts. This acidic environment provides conditions ideally suited to bacteria that metabolise cellulose. Insects cannot metabolise cellulose independently, but the presence of these bacteria allows cellulose to be metabolised into basic sugars. This provides nutrition to the black fly larvae, as well as the bacteria. This symbiotic relationship indicates a specific adaptation, as fresh-flowing streams could not provide sufficient nutrition to the growing larva in any other way.  Regional effects of black fly populations  * In the wetter parts of the northern latitudes of North America, including parts of Canada, New England, Minnesota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, black fly populations swell from late April to July, becoming a nuisance to humans engaging in common outdoor activities, such as gardening, boating, camping, and backpacking. They can also be a significant nuisance in mountainous areas. * Black flies are a scourge to livestock in Canada, causing weight loss in cattle and sometimes death.The Canadian Encyclopedia: Black Fly * Pennsylvania operates the largest single black fly control program in North America. The program is seen as beneficial to both the quality of life for residents and to the state's tourism industry. * The Blandford fly (Simulium posticatum) in England was once a public health problem in the area around Blandford Forum, Dorset, due to its large numbers and the painful lesions caused by its bite. It was eventually controlled by carefully targeted applications of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis. In 2010, a summer surge of insect bites blamed on the Blandford fly required many who had been bitten to be treated in a hospital. * The New Zealand \\"sandflies\\" are actually black flies of the species Austrosimulium australense and A. ungulatum. * In parts of Scotland, various species of black flies are a nuisance and bite humans, mainly between May and September. They are found mainly in mixed birch and juniper woodlands, and at lower levels in pine forests, moorlands, and pastures. Bites are most often found on the head, neck, and back. They also frequently land on legs and arms. * In Peninsular Malaysia 35 species of preimaginal black flies were discovered in a study in 2016, including Simulium digrammicum, which had been considered locally extinct. Dubawnt River, Nunavut.  Public health  Only four genera in the family Simuliidae, Simulium, Prosimulium, Austrosimulium, and Cnephia, contain species that feed on people, though other species prefer to feed on other mammals or on birds. Simulium, the type genus, is the most widespread and is a vector for several diseases, including river blindness. Mature adults can disperse tens or hundreds of miles from their breeding grounds in fresh flowing water, under their own power and assisted by prevailing winds, complicating control efforts. Swarming behavior can make outdoor activities unpleasant or intolerable, and can affect livestock production. During the 18th century, the \\"Golubatz fly\\" (Simulium colombaschense) was a notorious pest in central Europe. Even non-biting clouds of black flies, whether composed of males or of species that do not feed on humans or do not require a blood meal before egg laying, can form a nuisance by swarming into orifices. Bites are shallow and accomplished by first stretching the skin using teeth on the labrum and then abrading it with the maxillae and mandibles, cutting the skin and rupturing its fine capillaries. Feeding is facilitated by a powerful anticoagulant in the flies' saliva, which also partially numbs the site of the bite, reducing the host's awareness of being bitten and thereby extending the flies' feeding time. Biting flies feed during daylight hours only and tend to zero in on areas of thinner skin, such as the nape of the neck or ears and ankles. Itching and localized swelling and inflammation sometimes result from a bite. Swelling can be quite pronounced depending on the species and the individual's immune response, and irritation may persist for weeks. Intense feeding can cause \\"black fly fever\\", with headache, nausea, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and aching joints; these symptoms are probably a reaction to a compound from the flies' salivary glands. Less common severe allergic reactions may require hospitalization. Repellents provide some protection against biting flies. Products containing the active ingredient ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535), DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), or picaridin are most effective. Some beauty products have been found effective, and their use as insect repellents have been approved by EPA (e.g., Skin So Soft). However, given the limited effectiveness of repellents, protecting oneself against biting flies requires taking additional measures, such as avoiding areas inhabited by the flies, avoiding peak biting times, and wearing heavy-duty, light-colored clothing, including long-sleeve shirts, long pants and hats. When black flies are numerous and unavoidable, netting that covers the head, like the ‚Äúbee bonnets‚Äù used by beekeepers, can provide protection. = River blindness = Black flies are central to the transmission of the parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus which causes onchocerciasis, or \\"river blindness\\". It serves as the larval host for the nematode and acts as the vector by which the disease is spread. The parasite lives on human skin and is transmitted to the black fly during feeding.

First mention Pennsylvania, one of the original thirteen states of the American Union was named after William Penn's father, whose son received a grant of the territory from King Charles II in 1681. When Peter Stuyvesant, in 1655, conquered the Swedish colonies on the Delaware River, three Jews, Abraham de Lucena, Salvator Dandrade, and Jacob Coen, requested permission to trade along the Delaware River (November 29, 1655), claiming that under the act of February 15, 1655, they had received the consent of the directors of the West India Company to travel, reside, trade and enjoy the same privileges as other inhabitants. This petition was refused \\"for weighty reasons\\", but they were permitted to send two persons to the South River (subsequently named the Delaware) in order to terminate a trading expedition already entered upon. These were the first Jews of whom there is any record in Pennsylvania. On June 14, 1656, the directors of the West India Company wrote to Stuyvesant asking that the Jews be permitted to trade along the South River and \\"carry on their business as beforesaid\\". From this time on it is evident that the Jews traded with the Indians and Swedes in that territory. In 1657, Isaiah Mesa (also spelled \\"Masa\\" and \\"Mara\\"), \\"a Jew\\", is mentioned in the annals of Jacquet's administration as a participant in several lawsuits. In 1662, a community of Mennonites or Anabaptists proposed to settle at Horekill, in Delaware County, and in their articles of association they determined to exclude all \\"usurious Jews\\". When Sir Robert Carr, in 1664, assumed command of the Delaware in the name of the English crown, he received instructions from his government that \\"all people should enjoy the liberty of their conscience\\". Philadelphia In 1681, when William Penn gained possession of the land that bears his name, there must have been several Jewish settlers in the southeastern portion. The earliest Jewish resident of Philadelphia of whom there is any record was Jonas Aaron, who was living there in 1703. The most prominent member of the Jewish belief in the early history of the colony was Isaac Miranda. The date of his birth is not known; he died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1733. He took up his residence in the colony very early in the 18th century, and was one of the earliest Jewish settlers in Philadelphia and the first in Lancaster. In 1723, James Logan, secretary of the province, refers to him as an \\"apostate Jew or fashionable Christian proselyte,\\" who had gone into the interior of the colony to transact some official business. In 1727, Miranda was appointed \\"agent to receive and collect the perquisites and rights of Admiralty,\\" and on June 19, 1727, he was appointed \\"deputy judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty\\"‚Äîthe first judicial office held by a Jew in the provinces. He was a large holder of land, and his name is frequently mentioned in the archives of the colony. In 1730 (or 1720), the Indians of Lancaster made a complaint that he had acted unfairly toward them, but no action is recorded in the matter. Lancaster Jews came from the other colonies; some from New York, some even from Georgia, and took up their abode in the province. After Philadelphia, the next city in which they settled was Lancaster. The first Jewish resident was Isaac Miranda (see above), who owned property there before the town and county were organized in 1730. Ten years later, there were several Jewish families in the town; on February 3, 1747, there was recorded a deed to Isaac Nunus Ricus (Henriques) and Joseph Simon, conveying half an acre of land \\"in trust for the society of Jews settled in and about Lancaster\\", to be used as a place of burial. Henriques had come from Georgia in 1741. Joseph Simon was perhaps the best-known Jewish merchant in the county, while Dr. Isaac Cohen, one of the first residents of Lancaster, was the earliest Jewish physician in Pennsylvania. Scranton Scranton is the sixth-largest city in the state and the county seat of Lackawanna County. Jews settled there when the city was still called Harrison or Slocum's Hollow, the present name having been given to the city about 1850. The first Jew to hold public office was Joseph Rosenthal, who was Scranton's first, and for a long time its only, policeman. This was in 1860, when the population numbered but 8,500. The first Jewish congregation was organized in 1858, and was reconstituted in 1860 under the name \\"Anshe ·∏§esed.\\" In 1866, the synagogue on Linden street was built, it was the first building reared exclusively as a Jewish place of worship in Lackawanna County. This edifice, after having been twice rebuilt, was sold to the first Polish congregation in 1902, when the present temple, situated on Madison Avenue near Vine Street, was dedicated. E. K. Fisher was the first rabbi; and his successors were Rabbis-Cohn, Weil, Sohn, Eppstein, Freudenthal, L√∂wenberg, Feuerlicht, and Chapman; A. S. Anspacher was the Rabbi in 1905. The Rabbi as of 2010 was Rabbi Fine. As of 1906, there were about 5,000 Jews in Scranton in a total population of 105,000. They supported, in all, five congregations, and two Hebrew schools holding daily sessions. One of the latter, the Montefiore Hebrew School, had a well-equipped corps of teachers and an enrollment of about 200 male pupils. The other school which had higher attendance, possessed its own house in the South Side of the city, and was supported entirely by the large Hungarian community. For a while during the 1920s this community was headed by Rabbi Boruch Greenfeld, the author of the Sefer Ohel Boruch. The more important charitable organizations were: the Hebrew Ladies' Relief Society, the Ladies' Aid Society, the Deborah Verein, the South Side Relief Society, the Kitchen Garden School, and the Industrial Aid Society, a branch of the New York Removal Office. Reading A city in Berks County. A few Jewish immigrants settled here before 1847, when Reading became a city. In 1864, a cemetery plot was acquired in the southern part of the city, and in the same year Congregation Oheb Sholom was founded with about fifteen charter members, most of them South-Germans.Chabad House and Jewish Community Center offer path 'Toward a Meaningful Life', www.annarbor.com In 1884, a house of worship, located on Chestnut Street near Pearl Street, was bought from the Evangelical Church, and, after being rebuilt, it was dedicated July 31, 1885, by Isaac M. Wise. A rabbi and Sabbath-school teacher was engaged; and Reform service of a moderate type was instituted. In 1897 Rabbi Julius Frank, introduced the Union Prayer Book and full Reform service. In 1898 the congregation bought another cemetery at Shillington, three miles (5 km) from the city, the old one being vacated, and about sixty bodies were removed to the new burial-ground. Connected with the congregation are the Ladies' Hebrew Aid Society and the Ladies' Auxiliary.Chabad offers new course: ‚ÄòToward a Meaningful Life‚Äô, www.stljewishlight.com Reading's Conservative Jewish synagogue, Kesher Zion, was founded in 1929 from the merger of two other synagogues, and has been located across the street from City Park since 1950.http://www.kesherzion.org/ The Orthodox Jewish element, consisting entirely of Russian and Polish immigrants or their descendants, combined in 1887 and formed Congregation Shomrei Habrith. Their house of worship was located on North 8th street. A Hebrew School, that was situated on Moss street, is connected with this congregation.

Easton Easton, in Northampton County, was another town that contained pre- Revolutionary Jewish inhabitants. The first merchant in the town was Myer Hart de Shira (Texeira? See Hart), who is mentioned among the founders of Easton in 1750. He took the oath of allegiance to the colonial government in 1764, and became one of Easton's most wealthy citizens. Michael Hart (not related to Myer Hart) was an early resident. He was born in 1738 and became very rich, owning much property in the surrounding country. Michael Hart deeded to his son Jacob, on March 25, 1800, ground for a burial-place for the Jews. Although there were several families residing in Easton, a synagogue was not founded until 1839, when the Congregation Brit Sholom was established. It was chartered on November 25, 1842, and the Rev. Morris Kohn was its first rabbi. Aaronsburg Beginning as a post village situated in Haines Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, founded by Aaron Levy in 1786, and named for him. In June 1779, Levy bought off a Mr. Wetzel a tract in Centre County known as the Alexander Grant warranty. Upon this he laid out and planned the town of Aaronsburg, the town plan being recorded at Sunbury on October 4, 1786. A plot of ground known as Aaron's Square was reserved by the founder for public uses, and one of the streets was named Rachel's Way in honor of his wife. On November 16, 1789, Levy gave to the trustees of the Salem Evangelical Church a lot upon which to erect a church and schoolhouse. Aaronsburg is the first town in Pennsylvania (and probably in the United States) that was laid out by and named after a Jew. Schaefferstown Schaefferstown, now in Lebanon County, but originally in Lancaster County, is supposed to have contained Jewish inhabitants. According to tradition a synagogue existed there early in the 18th century, and a cemetery was established about 1732. The early German Pietists assumed many of the old Hebrew customs, and consequently were confounded with the Jews. Wilkes-Barre Willkes-Barre is the county-seat and principal city of Luzerne County. Evidence points to 1838 as the date of arrival of the first Jewish settlers, among whom Martin Long, a Bavarian, was the most prominent. Two years later, a society was organized for occasional worship, and until 1849 the incipient congregation held its services in various rooms. In August of that year it dedicated its first synagogue under the auspices of Moses Strasser, Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, and Samuel Isaacs of New York. In 1857 the community was incorporated as the Congregation B'nai B'rith. Its earlier pulpit history is practically the record of the service of Herman Rubin, reader and teacher from 1853 to 1882. His successors have been David Stern, Victor Rundbacken, Israel Joseph and Marcus Salzman. The rise of the younger generation gave a decided impetus to the growing tendency toward Reform, which resulted in the adoption of the Einhorn ritual. This yielded, in its turn, to the Union Prayer Book. B'nai B'rith, the largest congregation in the city, is the only Reform organization. Until 1871, B'nai B'rith was the only congregation in Wilkes-Barre, but in that year the first efforts were made to unite the Orthodox Jews. The organization, little more than a minyan, became the parent of the congregations B'nai Jacob and Holche Yosher, which were formed in 1881, although their synagogues were not built until 1886 and 1887, respectively. In 1902, a fourth synagogue was dedicated to the use of the youngest congregation, Oheb Zedek (Anshe Ungarn). The Jewish educational, philanthropic, and social activities of the city at the time were entrusted to the following institutions: the religious and Hebrew schools, the Synagogue Industrial School, branch lodges of the leading Jewish orders, the Young Men's Hebrew Association, the social and literary clubs, four aid societies, a free loan association, and the Executive Committee of Jewish Congregations. The latter organization, after 1901, aided the Industrial Removal Office, working to reduce the number of Jewish immigrants in New York City, thus lessening the attendant reaction of immigration restrictionists, and winning public opinion for continued immigration.Hasia R. Diner. The Jews of the United States, 1654 to 2000. p. 185-186. With this equipment, the community became an important center of Jewish activity in northeastern Pennsylvania, reaching out to Hazleton, Plymouth, Pittston and the smaller towns in the vicinity. As of 1905, the Jews of Wilkes-Barre numbered about 1,800, or about three percent of the total population. Other Early History Many Jews were connected with the sale and exploitation of land in Pennsylvania. In 1763, owing to the depredations of the Shawnee and Delaware Indians in Bedford County, twelve traders suffered a loss of ¬£80,000, among whom were David Franks, Levy Andrew Levy, and Joseph Simon. On July 5, 1773, the sale of southern Illinois took place. The Indian nations of the Illinois country conveyed their property to twenty-two residents of Pennsylvania, among whom were Moses Franks, Jacob Franks, Barnard Gratz, Michael Gratz, David Franks, Moses Franks, Jr., Joseph Simon and Levy Andrew Levy. This territory never became the property of those interested in its sale. The greatest speculator in land in the province was Aaron Levy, who in 1779 purchased land in Haines township, Center county, upon which he laid out the town of Aaronsburg (recorded October 4, 1786), the first town in the United States laid out and named after a Jew. Levy was interested with Robert Morris in the well-known speculation in lands in the western portion of the state which resulted so disastrously to the \\"financier of the Revolution\\" (see Levy, Aaron). It is estimated that there were not more than 800 Jews in Pennsylvania at the close of the War of Independence. The greater portion had taken up their residence after 1765, and many had arrived eleven years later, after New York had been occupied by the British. The Jews enjoyed all the rights of the other inhabitants, except that none could become a member of the General Assembly. There was nothing in the Constitution as established by the General Convention in 1776 that prevented a Jew from becoming a judicial, executive or military officer of the commonwealth. On December 23, 1783, Rabbi Gershom Mendes Seixas, Simon Nathan (\\"parnas\\"), Asher Myers, Barnard Gratz, and Haym Solomon, the \\"Mahamad\\" of the Congregation Mickv√© Israel, Philadelphia, petitioned the Council of Censors that there be removed from the Constitution the declaration requiring each member of the Assembly to affirm his belief in the divine inspiration of the New Testament. The law was subsequently changed, and all civil disabilities of the Jews were removed. Successive settlers The history of the Jews in Pennsylvania after 1825 is the history of their activities in the various cities in which they settled, and which are treated in the respective articles. Although Jews had taken an active interest in the development of the western portion of the state from a time preceding the Revolution, it was more in the way of speculation and investment; it was not until the first quarter of the 19th century that the Jews settled in Pittsburgh and the other western cities. Wilkes-Barre and Harrisburg had few Jewish inhabitants, and Aaronsburg, although founded by a Jew, had only a few Jewish residents. It was not until after the Spanish and Portuguese Jews had ceased to migrate in numbers to America that the western portion of the state was settled, and this was owing to the arrival of many Jews of German and Polish origin. Yet the early Jewish pioneers, those that had settled in Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Easton long before the Revolution, had come from Germany and Holland, while the first settlers of New York; Newport, Rhode Island; and Savannah, Georgia, had been mostly of Spanish descent. About 1825 there was a fresh exodus from Germany, and many Jews settled in Philadelphia and became important factors in the community, while others traveled westward and helped in the development of many towns. =Pittsburgh= Although Jews had been living in Pittsburgh ever since it was incorporated in 1804, it was not until 1830 that there was an actual Jewish community there, and this consisted of Jews of German origin. In 1846 the first congregation was organized and named \\"Etz-Chayim\\". It met in a small room in Third Street, over an engine-house; its first presiding officer was William Frank. The Congregation Rodef Sholem, one of the most important congregations in the state, was established in 1858. At present Pittsburgh (with Allegheny) contains the second-largest Jewish community in Pennsylvania. =Harrisburg= The first Jewish settlers in Harrisburg arrived from Germany in the early 1840s. The oldest congregation is Ohev Sholom, established in 1853 (present rabbi, Peter Kessler); Chisuk Emmunah and Beth-El were established after 1884. The city possesses also a benevolent society and two other societies. The present (1904) Jewish population of the city is 1,200 in a total of about 70,000 inhabitants. =Other areas= Other important towns containing many Jewish residents are: Wilkes-Barre, whose first synagogue, B'nai B'rith, was incorporated in 1848; Scranton, which has three synagogues, the earliest, the Anshe Chesed, having been incorporated January 7, 1862; Reading, which has two congregations, one of which, the Oheb Sholom, was founded May 1, 1864. In addition, the following towns contain enough Jewish families to support at least one synagogue: Allentown, Altoona, Beaver Falls, Braddock, Bradford, Butler, Carbondale, Chambersburg, Chester, Connellsville, Danville, DuBois, Dunmore, Duquesne, Erie, Greensburg, Hazleton, Homestead, Honesdale, Indiana, http://synagogues.find-near-me.info/in/indiana-paJohnstown, McKeesport, Newcastle, Oil City, Ph√¶nixville, Pottsville, Shamokin, Sharon, Shenandoah, South Bethlehem, South Sharon, Titusville, Uniontown, Washington, Williamsport, and York. Jews are settled with some sort of organization in at least fifty towns in the state. The expulsion of the Jews from Russia was the occasion of many settling in this state. They began to arrive in 1882, and at the present time they constitute the majority of the Jewish population. 1906 statistics In the state of Pennsylvania there were thirty-four cities and towns with one or more Jewish institutions. Of these, 31 have 92 regularly organized congregations, 2 hold holy-day services, and in 1 no communal religious life exists.Briefly In Religion There are 59 congregations with a membership of about 7,000 and an income of over $120,000; 8 congregations are affiliated with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; 38 have together 33 cemeteries, and there are 2 cemeteries independent of organized congregations; 29 congregations report schools with 2,433 pupils; 7 schools are affiliated with the Hebrew Sabbath-School Union of America. Free religious schools are conducted by 2 societies, 1 reporting an income of $3,187, with 2,721 pupils; there are 2 Hebrew Free Schools with an income of $5,660, and instructing 430 pupils.Chabad's JLI: Tools for Living Exclusive of the schools and classes for religious instruction, there were, chiefly in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Wilkesbarre, the following educational agencies: 1 manual-training school; 4 societies conducting industrial classes; 2 societies conducting evening classes; 2 kindergartens; 1 day-nursery; 2 alumni associations, furthering religious instruction; and 1 college for Hebrew studies. Three of these report an income of $21,316, and 3 others report 499 pupils. There are 41 charitable societies, 23 of which report an income of $219,324, of which $193,396 must be set to the credit of Philadelphia.JLI to Offer \\"Toward a Meaningful Life: A Soul-Searching Journey for Every Jew\\" Israeli consul general proves inspiring, educational in Swampscott talk The charitable societies include 3 orphan asylums, 1 hospital, 1 home for incurables, 1 maternity hospital, 1 \\"friendly inn\\" and home for the aged‚Äîall except 1 orphan asylum being in Philadelphia. There are 11 social clubs (5 with an income of $25,620), 4 associations for young men (2 with an income of $4,718), 1 loan-association, 14 mutual-benefit societies‚Äîall in Philadelphia. There are also 12 literary clubs (11 in Philadelphia) and 2 musical associations. In two cities there were branches of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle; in four, sections of the Council of Jewish Women; in five, 9 Zionist societies; and in seventeen, 60 lodges. The last-mentioned are distributed among the orders as follows: 25, Independent Order B'nai B'rith; 6, Independent OrderFree Sons of Israel; 17, Independent Order Sons of Benjamin; and 12, Order B'rith Abraham. The present population of Pennsylvania is 6,302,115, including more than 100,000 Jews.Medicine and Morals course in Brisbane See also * American Jews ** List of American Jews * History of the Jews in Colonial America * History of the Jews in the United States Bibliography * H.

Other regularly occurring characters include Mr and Mrs Thomas (Mog's owners) and their two children Nicky and Debbie. In each book Mog gets into a different conundrum with a new character or event. Unusually for a popular children's series, Mog dies in the final book, 2002's Goodbye, Mog. Kerr based her illustrations of the house in which the family live on her own family home in Barnes, London, and the two children were named after the middle names of her own son and daughter, Matthew and Tacy. The family name \\"Thomas\\" is from the first name of her husband, Nigel Kneale, upon whom the appearance of Mr Thomas was based. In November 2015, Mog returned as a CGI character for the Christmas advert for supermarket Sainsbury's. In Mog's Christmas Calamity Mog accidentally starts a fire in her home after having a bad dream, but is able to alert the fire brigade (as she had called 999 when scrabbling across a phone); she is hailed a hero for saving her owners, and (after her owners' neighbours pool their resources to undo the damage she had done, in reference to Sainsbury's \\"Christmas is for sharing\\" tagline) is later given an egg as a treat. Kerr herself appears in this advert as a neighbour of the Thomas family. A special plush Mog and book version of the story were sold exclusively through Sainsbury's, with all profits being donated to Save the Children's child literacy work.

She is better known as the second wife of the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, who married her in 1940. Life Vera de Bosset was born Vera Bosse, the daughter of Eduard Bosse (1854-1927)Die Nachkommen des Kantors, Schulmeisters und Hilfspredigers an der St. Petri-Gemeinde in St. Petersburg Sebastian Bosse (1697-1775), in: Baltische Ahnen- und Stammtafeln Sonderheft 12 (K√∂ln 1976), p. 10 and Hedwig von Ruckteschel (1866-1938).GHdBR (NF) Band II (2012) , p. 338 Both parents were Baltic German nobility.However, in Craft 2013, p. 154, Robert Craft describes Vera as being born \\"to a French father and Swedish mother, neither with any Russian blood.\\" She was sent to boarding school in Moscow, where she learned how to play piano. Vera allegedly changed her name to the French \\"Bosset\\" to hide her German ancestry. She was the only one of her family to do so. Stravinsky met Vera in 1921. She was a dancer and the wife of the painter and stage designer Serge Sudeikin. Stravinsky was then married to his cousin Yekaterina Nosenko and had four children. Stravinsky and Vera began an affair which led to her leaving her husband. From then until the death of Katerina from tuberculosis in March 1939, Stravinsky led a double life, spending most of his time with his wife and children and the rest with Vera. Yekaterina reportedly bore her husband's infidelity \\"with a mixture of magnanimity, bitterness, and compassion\\".Joseph, Charles M.. 2001. Stravinsky Inside Out.

It was the first game developed by Traveller's Tales. The game was developed on the Amiga, then converted to the Atari ST by Philipp Wyatt for W.J.S Design. A year later it was published for the Sega Genesis as Galahad by Electronic Arts.  Plot  Leander on the Amiga 500 The player assumes the role of the legendary knight Leander (changed in the Genesis port to Galahad, son of Lancelot) and rescue the princess Lucanna from the wizard Thanatos (Miragorn in the Genesis port, who kidnapped Lucanna in an attempt to get King Arthur to come to him).  Gameplay  Leander collects coins through three sprawling worlds, each composed of seven levels, with which he can purchase armour, potions and new swords in a shop which appears infrequently during the game. The ultimate aim of each level is to find a certain object named at the start of a level (with instructions where to find it). When Leander finds it, he must find a portal which will lead him on to the next level. If he does not find the object, he cannot enter the portal. Enemies encountered during the game range from dragons and elves to snakes and giant otters. At the end of each world, Leander faces a gargantuan boss, whom he must defeat to enter the next world. =Cameos from other games= In the final world, there is a secret Lemmings-styled area and the main character from The Killing Game Show appears as an enemy as well as a larger version of him. In the game Puggsy, originally made for the Sega Mega Drive, and also published by Psygnosis, an \\"extra-secret\\" level called \\"Lee and Errr\\", which can only be accessed by working out a math equation given during the credits after completing the story game, contains the following message written in large print in the background: \\"Leander is Galahad on the Megadrive\\". Reception The One gave the Amiga version of Leander an overall score of 93%, calling it \\"classy\\" and \\"graphically amazing\\", making note of \\"additional touches\\" such as detailed waves, waterfalls and rain. The One praises Leander's colourful graphics, 'smooth' scrolling, and gameplay, stating that \\"Leander has captured the console concept perfectly ... Control over Leander quickly becomes second nature, but is sophisticated enough to allow high jumping and ladder climbing.\\" Anti-Piracy A hole was punched into the disk, which should result in an error. If this punch isn't present, the game freezes and refuses to load. Should this check be removed, the game will load fine then, but with one catch. The player will be unable to get past Level 4 as one of the platforms needed to progress has its collision removed. Further levels have no terrain whatsoever, resulting in the player falling through the platforms. Not only this, but the damage the player deals is halved.

As a noted motorbike enthusiast, Boorman is widely known for a series of three long distance motorcycle rides with friend Ewan McGregor, documented in Long Way Round (2004, 31K km), Long Way Down (2007, 24K km), and Long Way Up (2020, 21K km). Early life and background Born in Wimbledon, London, Boorman spent much of his formative years in County Wicklow, Ireland. Boorman is the son of German costume designer Christel Kruse and film director John Boorman. Boorman attended three schools in Ireland: St Gerard's School (Bray, County Wicklow) and St Oliver Plunkett Primary School (Monkstown, County Dublin), both Roman Catholic schools, the latter a school dedicated to teaching children with dyslexia. He also attended the German-language medium school, St Kilians Deutsche Schule (Dublin). In England, he went on to attend Sibford School, a Quaker school near Banbury, Oxfordshire (from 1980‚Äì83), where he received extra lessons in a specialist department catering for pupils with dyslexia.Daily Mail Weekend Interview. 16 June 2012, pg 6 =Marriage= He and his wife Olivia have two daughters and live in London. Acting career At an early age, Boorman started appearing in films directed by his father. His first role was in Deliverance (1972). According to Adam Savage, Boorman appeared uncredited with Ridley Scott's son, Luke, in the film Alien (1979). Boorman played a young Mordred in Excalibur (1981) (joined by his older sister Katrine Boorman who played Ygraine, Mordred's grandmother), then in 1985 played a leading role in The Emerald Forest. In 1987 he had a non- speaking role as a young German Luftwaffe pilot parachuting into a small village in Hope and Glory (his sister Katrine also appeared in that film). His further acting appearances include The Serpent's Kiss (1997), on which he met Ewan McGregor, and The Bunker (2001). Theatre show In 2007, Boorman appeared on stage in Newcastle upon Tyne at the Tyne Theatre. The 'evening with' style show then went on a tour around the UK and Ireland in 2010. Around this time Boorman revealed he had testicular cancer. Caught early, he had a testicle removed and has since been a supporter of Movember. Boorman was given the all-clear, but continued telling audiences across the country about his ordeal, encouraging more men to be aware and get checked out early if there was any concern. In 2011, the Charley Boorman Live show toured the UK and Ireland again, following a similar format to the first tour but without support acts. Boorman also began promoting African Adventures, which are commercial 17-day BMW motorcycle trips across Africa. Taking 50 riders from Cape Town to Victoria Falls, Boorman used various technologies to help promote the trip, including a GPS satellite tracking device allowing people to follow the trip day by day. Charity work Boorman has supported the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) since 2004, carrying out a number of visits to UNICEF projects, which have been noted in his television programmes Long Way Round, Long Way Down and By Any Means. In 2009, Boorman was made president of Dyslexia Action; he is dyslexic. Boorman has been on many visits to Dyslexia Action's regional centres and was involved in the charity's appeal \\"It's ME!\\". He also supported its school initiative \\"P4L\\" (Partnership for Literacy). Boorman recently participated in a live web chat for the charity where he answered questions about his dyslexia and his various adventures. In 2009, Boorman went to Helmand Province, Afghanistan and visited troops. Kandahar and Bastion were the two key camps he visited, just before Christmas. In February 2014 and November 2016 Boorman presented Gold Duke of Edinburgh's Awards at St James's Palace, on behalf of The Duke of Edinburgh. Accident Boorman was involved in a serious accident whilst test riding a motorbike with journalists in Portugal in 2016. Boorman broke both legs after colliding with a wall whilst avoiding a car that pulled out in front of him. He then broke his hip riding a Vespa whilst still in recovery. After a period confined to a wheelchair, Boorman is back riding, but now walks with a limp as his left leg is 1cm shorter than his right after operations to repair the breaks. Presenting career =Long Way Round= In 2004, Ewan McGregor and Boorman decided to embark on an epic journey taking them from London to New York, which resulted in the hit television show Long Way Round, an international motorbike trip from London to New York City via Europe and Asia.Long Way Round official website This was recorded, then later made into a television series, book and DVD. The series was shown around the world and the DVD and book became best sellers. Critical responses were mixed, with one noting 'Boorman comes across as a copper-bottomed, ocean-going, 24-carat prick.' =Race to Dakar= Along with producer Russ Malkin (from Long Way Round) and a motorbike team, Boorman competed in the 2006 Dakar Rally in January 2006.

He performed his most well known research at the University of Brussels, studying corrosion. His biggest achievement is the derivation of potential-pH, better known as ‚ÄúPourbaix Diagrams‚Äù. Pourbaix Diagrams are thermodynamic charts constructed using the Nernst equation and visualize the relationship between possible phases of a system, bounded by lines representing the reactions that transport between them. They can be read much like a phase diagram. In 1963, Pourbaix produced \\"Atlas of Electrochemical Equilibria\\", which contains potential-pH diagrams for all elements known at the time. Pourbaix and his collaborators began preparing the work in the early 1950s. Early life He was born in Myshega (Aleksin District, Tula Governorate, Russia, ), where his father was a consultant on an engineering project. He studied in Brussels and graduated from the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in 1927. By 1938, he had devised the potential-pH diagrams. In 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, he presented to the Faculty his doctoral dissertation, accompanied by a thesis entitled \\"Thermodynamics of Dilute Aqueous Solutions. Graphical Representation of the Role of pH and Potential.\\" The war and some confusion among the jury on the sign of electrode potential impeded the completion of his graduation process. However, the thesis was presented to the Technical University Delft. During the fifties and early sixties, Marcel Pourbaix and his collaborators produced potential-pH diagrams for all the elements and published the \\"Atlas of Electrochemical Equilibria\\" in French in 1963 and in English in 1966. As early as in 1962, he introduced the concept of a protection potential against the propagation of localized corrosion, which he developed in 1963, in relation with the peculiar electrochemical conditions in occluded electrochemical cells. Pourbaix' doctoral thesis had a major influence on corrosion science. Ulick R. Evans found this work important and arranged for an English translation, published by Arnold (London) in 1949. In 1949, he was one of the founders of CITCE (Comite International de Thermodynamique et Cinetique Electrochimiques) together with 13 other electrochemists: C.Boute, J.Gillis, A. Julliard (Belgium), P. Delahay, P.Van Rysselberghe (USA), J.O'M.Bockris, T.P.Hoar (UK), G.Charlot, G.Valensi (France), R.Piontelli (Italy), G.Burgers (The Netherlands) and J.Heyrovsky (Czechoslovakia). CITCE was a major success. In 1971 the name was changed to International Society of Electrochemistry (ISE). The current membership is over 1100 with members from 59 countries. In 1951 he founded CEBELCOR, which became one of the world's first centres dedicated to the theoretical and experimental study of corrosion phenomena. In 1952 Pourbaix founded the Commission of Electrochemistry of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and that Commission clarified in 1953 the chaotic state of affairs then prevailing in the signs of electrode potentials. Career Pourbaix was an international collaborator in combating corrosion, visiting and lecturing widely during his career. He contributed actively to the creation of an International Corrosion Council (ICC) with the aim of encouraging research and international cooperation in corrosion science and engineering and friendship among scientists and engineers. In 1990, The National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) created a \\"Marcel Pourbaix Award Student Fellowship\\" and the ICC created in 1996 a \\"Marcel Pourbaix Award for International Cooperation.\\" Pourbaix worked on the \\"Atlas of Chemical and Electrochemical Equilibria in the Presence of a Gas Phase,\\" a work that cover an even wider field than the Atlas in aqueous solutions. Marcel Pourbaix was founder, honorary director and scientific adviser of CEBELCOR (Belgian Center for Corrosion Study), Professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, co-founder of CITCE, former chairman of the Commission of Electrochemistry of IUPAC (1952), of ICC (1969), member of the Advisory Committee of Electrochimica Acta (1959-1972) and of the Executive Board of Corrosion Science.http://corrosion- doctors.org/Biographies/PourbaixBio.htm References * Pourbaix, M., Atlas of electrochemical equilibria in aqueous solutions. 2d English ed. 1974, Houston, Tex.: National Association of Corrosion Engineers.

Biklen learned of work of Rosemary Crossley and developed the theory of facilitated communication in Melbourne, Australia and exported it to the United States. According to this theory, some individuals whose communication is hindered by developmental coordination disorder can communicate with the aid of a facilitator, who supports the patient's hand while he or she types words on a keyboard. However, studies have repeatedly found that the messages produced through facilitated communication are authored by the facilitator, rather than the disabled person. In all controlled studies where clients and facilitators are given different information (shown two different objects, for example) what is typed responds to what is seen by the facilitator, not the client. Biklen co-produced the 2004 film Autism Is a World, directed by Geraldine Wurzburg. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject, but its positive portrayal of facilitated communication was criticised by autism researchers. Gina Green of San Diego State University stated that making a film without \\"even a hint, much less a disclosure\\" of the evidence against facilitated communication \\"is appalling\\". Biklen also produced the film My Classic Life as an Artist: A Portrait of Larry Bissonnette at Syracuse University. Biklen has worked at Syracuse University since 1969 and founded the university's Facilitated Communication Institute in 1992. Following Burton Blatt as Dean, Biklen has been university leadership with the Center on Human Policy since its inception. In August 2005, Biklen became Dean of the School of Education. The appointment was criticised by the Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health and by some members of the special education research community. Biklen was also a founding member of the International Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps, which has organized special educators across the United States.

The bank is a subsidiary of the Canadian multinational investment bank and financial services company Bank of Montreal, commonly known as \\"BMO\\" (pronounced ), which owns BMO Harris Bank through the holding company BMO Financial Corporation (formerly Bankmont Financial Corporation, then Harris Financial Corporation). History BMO Harris Bank footprint Harris Trust Building in Chicago Norman Wait Harris (c. 1911), founder of N.W. Harris & Co., later Harris Trust & Savings Bank In 1882, Norman Wait Harris established N.W. Harris & Co., a Chicago-based municipal bond broker and the forerunner of Harris Bank. Harris Trust and Savings Bank was established 1907. It merged with Chicago National Bank in 1960 and was restructured as Harris Bank, N.A. in 1972. Bank of Montreal (later known as BMO Financial Group) acquired Harris in 1984. The bank grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions beginning with the First National Bank of Barrington in 1985, State Bank of St. Charles and First National Bank of Batavia in 1988 and Libertyville Federal Savings Bank and Loan and Frankfort Bancshares in 1990. Harris Bankcorp and Suburban Bancorp combined under the Harris name in 1994 and two years later, the company acquired 54 Chicago area branches from Household Bank. In 1999, the direct brokerage firm Burke, Christensen & Lewis merged with Harris Investors Direct to form Harris InvestorLine. The company's further acquisitions include Freeman Welwood in 2000; Village Bank of Naples, and Century Bank (Arizona) and First National Bank of Joliet in 2001; Northwestern Trust and Investors Advisory Company (Seattle) in 2002. Also in 2002, InvestorLine combined with CSFBdirect to form Harrisdirect and Harris acquired online client accounts of Morgan Stanley Individual Investor Group and myCFO. The following year, it purchased Sullivan, Bruyette Speros & Blayney Incorporated, followed by Lakeland Community Bank in Round Lake, Trust and Savings Bank in 2005. The bank encourages pronouncing it as \\"B-MO\\" (/ÀàbiÀêmo ä/). BMO continued its acquisitions in 2007 with First National Bank & Trust, (Kokomo, Indiana) followed by Ozaukee Bank, (Cedarburg, Wisconsin) and Merchant and Manufacturers Bankcorp Inc., (New Berlin, Wisconsin) in 2008 and Amcore Bank N.A. (Rockford, Illinois) on April 23, 2010. On December 17, 2010, Bank of Montreal agreed to purchase Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley Corporation in an all-stock transaction valued at about US$4.1 billion. Marshall & Ilsley and Harris Bankcorp were both rebranded as BMO Harris. The company restructured as BMO Bankcorp July 5, 2011. In December 2015, the company completed its acquisition of General Electric Capital Corp.'s transportation finance business.

BMO Harris Bank is one of the largest banks in the Midwest with over 600 branches and approximately 1,300 ATMs in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Arizona, Florida and California. It is the second-largest Chicago-area bank based on market share, behind JPMorgan Chase, and the second largest US subsidiary of a Canadian bank after TD Bank, N.A. (owned by the Toronto-Dominion Bank). BMO Harris Bank, N.A. is the issuer of the Diners Club cards in United States. Headquarters BMO Harris is headquartered in a complex of three buildings in Chicago's Loop neighborhood. The original 21-story building was constructed in 1910 at 119 West Monroe Street. The entrance to the building is flanked by two bas-relief sculptures of lions, which inspired various iterations of the bank's logo until 2011, along with the bank's mascot character, Hubert the Lion. In 1960, a 23-story structure was added to the east with the address of 111 West Monroe. In 1974, a second 38-story tower was added to the west with the address of 115 South LaSalle Street. Both additions were designed by the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and are in the modern style. The bank uses the address of the 1960 building. In December 2018, the bank announced it would move its headquarters to 14 floors of a 50-story office tower adjacent to Chicago Union Station. The bank expects the new BMO Tower to be ready in 2022. Additionally, notable BMO Harris buildings are located in Milwaukee (BMO Harris Financial Center), at 770 North Water Street, and Indianapolis (BMO Plaza). In 2017, the bank began construction of a 25-story BMO Tower at North Water and East Wells, adjacent to its current Milwaukee headquarters. The bank expects to occupy of the building beginning in December 2019. In August 2017, the BMO Harris sold the 20-story structure it currently occupies to real estate firm Irgens who plans to remodel and lease it.

Early life Breese was born in Chicago to David and Ruth (Gunton) Breese. He was the youngest of four children, having three older sisters including, Betty, and twin sisters, Mary and Margaret (\\"Marge\\"). He also had a foster brother, Bob Gaudio, whom Breese's parents took in as a child. Breese attended Lane Technical High School, an all-boys school with 8,000 students. As a youth, he had been fascinated by airplanes and flying. During World War II, Breese entered Pre- Flight Training at Lane Tech, in the hope of serving his country. When he was in high school, all of Breese's sisters were involved in a, \\"Hi-C Club,\\" a Christian youth organization. One week, when Breese was 16 years old, the Hi-C meeting was held at his house. Though Breese had no interest in religious pursuits, he heard a woman clearly present a Gospel message while teaching on the Holy Bible's, Book of Romans. A couple weeks later, he decided to believe the message and was converted to belief in Jesus Christ. =Further schooling= Breese completed his undergraduate studies at Judson University, in Elgin, Illinois, and then went on to Northern Baptist Seminary, in Lombard, Illinois. Eventually, he earned his \\"multiengine rating.\\" In the years that followed, he flew himself to speaking engagements all across the country. Ministry In addition to pulpit preaching, Breese also recorded many messages for broadcast. His family tells stories of him sitting up late at night, making radio programs on a simple recorder with a blanket over his head, because of the outside noises. At that time, he didn‚Äôt have a recording studio. In addition to his prolific writing, Breese was also a poet. His sister, Betty, has told of how in his early years his mother would have a young Dave Breese recite poetry. This contributed to his abilities as a public speaker and writer. Family life Breese married Carol Flaming, whom he met at a meeting in Winona Lake, Indiana. They had two daughters, Lynn and Noelle. Just as his parents had a foster son named Bob, Breese and his wife provided a home for a young Laotian boy, Lomae, who is considered part of the extended Breese family today. Accomplishments Dave Breese Breese was: * A formative force in the early years of Youth For Christ, serving 13 years. * Influential in the establishment of the AWANA Youth Association. * A speaker on Back to the Bible Broadcast‚Äôs, \\"Pause For Good News,\\" for 13 years. * A member of the Board of the National Religious Broadcasters and the National Association of Evangelicals. * Founder of the \\"Christian Destiny\\" ministry, in 1963. * President and Bible teacher on, \\"The King Is Coming\\" telecast * Radio Broadcaster on, \\"Dave Breese Reports,\\" and, \\"Dave Breese Reporting.\\" * Consultant and friend to presidents, statesmen and religious leaders. * Author of many books and booklets. By the 1980s, Breese had gained national prominence via his radio broadcasts \\"Dave Breese Reports\\" and \\"Dave Breese Reporting!\\" His network of over a hundred stations covered much of the United States. In the mid-'80s, Breese accepted the call to become speaker on \\"The King is Coming\\" telecast and later assumed the presidency of the telecast‚Äôs parent organization, \\"World Prophetic Ministry.\\" His outreach via television spanned the globe, reaching across all of America and into 57 nations of the world. Major publication In 1990, Breese published Seven Men Who Rule the World from the Grave (). The seven men he highlighted are: * Charles Darwin, who systematized and advanced the principle that evolution was behind the origin of species. * Karl Marx, who developed and advocated the notion of modern Communism. * Julius Wellhausen, who initiated \\"higher criticism\\" and \\"modernism.\\" * John Dewey, who argued for an educational system focused on problem solving and the growth of the child in all aspects of his being. * Sigmund Freud, who promoted the view that the sexual instinct is the driving force behind all human action. * John Maynard Keynes, who advocated the policies for reducing unemployment and expanding the economy that today find their expression in deficit spending and governmental activism. * S√∏ren Kierkegaard, who stressed the obligation each person has to make conscious, responsible choices among alternatives, a major tenet of existentialism. Final days Just after the year 2000 rang in, Breese suffered a stroke. He had rarely turned down an invitation to preach. In an average year, he would travel over 100,000 miles to speak at churches, Bible conferences, colleges, universities, evangelistic meetings and debates. The busy schedule had taken its toll. After his stroke, he continued to write. Breese died May 3, 2002.

This technique uses edge coherence to speed calculations in the algorithm. However, QI really only works well when bodies are larger solids, non- interpenetrating, and not transparent. A technique like this falls apart when applied to soft organic tissue as found in the human body, because there is not always a clear delineation of structures. Also, when images become too cluttered and intertwined, the contribution of this algorithm is marginal. Arthur Appel of the graphics group at IBM Watson Research coined the term quantitative invisibility and used it in several of his papers.

It won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the 1999 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, and was later made into an Oscar-winning 2002 film of the same name starring Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Plot introduction Portrait of Virginia Woolf (January 25, 1882 ‚Äì March 28, 1941), British author and feminist. The book concerns three generations of women affected by the classic novel Mrs. Dalloway. In Richmond, 1923, author Virginia Woolf is writing Mrs. Dalloway and struggling with her own mental illness. In 1949 Los Angeles, Mrs. Brown, wife of a World War II veteran, who is reading Mrs. Dalloway, plans her husband's birthday party. In 1999 New York City, Clarissa Vaughan plans a party to celebrate a major literary award received by her good friend and former lover, the poet Richard, who is dying of an AIDS-related illness. The situations of all three characters mirror situations experienced by Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway in Mrs. Dalloway, with Clarissa Vaughan being a very literal modern-day version of Woolf's character. Like Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa Vaughan goes on a journey to buy flowers while reflecting on the minutiae of the day around her and later prepares to throw a party. Clarissa Dalloway and Clarissa Vaughan also both reflect on their histories and past loves in relation to their current lives, which they both perceive as trivial. A number of other characters in Clarissa Vaughan's story also parallel characters in Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. Cunningham's novel also mirrors Mrs. Dalloway's stream-of- consciousness narrative style (a style pioneered by Woolf and James Joyce) in which the flowing thoughts and perceptions of protagonists are depicted as they would occur in real life, unfiltered, flitting from one thing to another, and often rather unpredictable. In terms of time, this means characters interact not only with the present, but also memories; this contextualizes personal history and backstory, which otherwise might appear quite trivial‚Äîbuying flowers, baking a cake and such things. Cunningham's novel also uses the device in Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway of placing the action of the novel within the space of one day. In Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway it is one day in the life of the central character Clarissa Dalloway. In Cunningham's book it is one day in the life of each of the three central characters; Clarissa Vaughan, Laura Brown and Virginia Woolf herself. Through this prism, Cunningham attempts, as did Woolf, to show the beauty and profundity of every day--even the most ordinary--in every person's life and conversely how a person's whole life can be examined through the prism of one single day. Michael Cunningham took the novel's title, The Hours, from the original working title that Virginia Woolf used for Mrs. Dalloway. Plot summary Note: This Summary does not contain the whole book, nor end at the ending. The stream-of- consciousness style being so prominent in this work, a summary of the plot based on physical action does not give a thorough understanding of the content of the work. In the novel, action occurring in the physical world (i.e.: characters doing things, such as talking, walking etc.) is far outweighed by material existing in the thought and memory of the protagonists. Some discretion must be made in a plot summary as to which of these thoughts and memories warrant detailing. =Prologue= In 1941, Virginia Woolf commits suicide by drowning herself in the Ouse, a river in Sussex, England. Even as she is drowning, Virginia marvels at everyday sights and sounds. Leonard Woolf, her husband, finds her suicide note, and Virginia's dead body floats downstream where life, in the form of a mother and child going for a walk, goes on as if Virginia is still taking in all the sights and sounds. *I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. :-- from Virginia Woolf's suicide note to Leonard Woolf. p7, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Dalloway= The novel jumps to New York City at the end of the 20th century where Clarissa Vaughan (Cunningham's modern Mrs. Dalloway), announcing she will buy the flowers for a party she's hosting later in the day, paraphrases the opening sentence of Woolf's novel. She leaves her partner Sally cleaning their apartment and heads outside into a June morning. Walking to the flower shop, Clarissa enjoys the everyday hustle and bustle of the city. The sights and sounds she encounters serve as jumping-off points for her thoughts about life, her loves and her past. The beautiful day reminds her of a happy memory, a holiday she had as a young woman with two friends, Richard and Louis. In fact, the flowers are for a party Clarissa is hosting at her apartment that night for Richard (now a renowned poet dying of AIDS) as he has just won the Carrouthers, an esteemed poetry prize awarded for a life's work. Clarissa bumps into Walter, an acquaintance who writes gay pulp fiction romances. Clarissa invites him to the party although she knows Richard abhors Walter's shallow interests in \\"fame and fashions, the latest restaurant\\". Clarissa herself appreciates Walter's \\"greedy innocence.\\"Cunningham, Michael, 'The Hours,' Fourth Estate: Great Britain, 1999 paperback edition, p18. Clarissa continues on her way reflecting on her past, sometimes difficult relationship with Richard which she compares to her more stable but unspectacular relationship with her partner of eighteen years, Sally. She finally arrives at the flower shop. *What a thrill, what a shock, to be alive on a morning in June, prosperous, almost scandalously privileged, with a simple errand to run. :-- Clarissa reflecting on the day as she walks to the flower shop. p10, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *Why doesn't she feel more somber about Richard's perversely simultaneous good fortune (\\"an anguished, prophetic voice in American letters\\") and his decline (\\"You have no T-cells at all, none that we can detect\\")? What is wrong with her? She loves Richard, she thinks of him constantly, but she perhaps loves the day slightly more. :-- Clarissa thinking about Richard. p11, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *The woman's head quickly withdraws, the door to the trailer closes again, but she leaves behind her an unmistakable sense of watchful remonstrance, as if an angel had briefly touched the surface of the world with one sandaled foot, asked if there was any trouble and, being told all was well, had resumed her place in the ether with skeptical gravity, having reminded the children of earth that they are just barely trusted to manage their own business, and that further carelessness will not go unremarked. :-- Clarissa spotting a movie star sticking her head outside her trailer door in response to a film crew's noisiness. p27, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Woolf= The novel then jumps to 1923 with Virginia Woolf waking one morning with the possible first line of a new novel. She carefully navigates her way through the morning, so as not to lose her inspiration. When she picks up her pen, she writes: Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. =Mrs. Brown= The novel jumps to 1949 Los Angeles with Laura Brown reading the first line of Virginia's Woolf's novel 'Mrs. Dalloway.' (\\"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.\\") Laura Brown is pregnant with her second child and is reading in bed. She does not want to get up despite it being her husband Dan's birthday. She is finding it hard playing the role of wife to Dan, and mother to her son Richie, despite her appreciation for them. She would much rather read her book. She eventually forces herself to go downstairs where she decides to make a cake for Dan's birthday which Richie will help her make. *He makes her think sometimes of a mouse singing amorous ballads under the window of a giantess. :-- Laura reflecting on her son's transparent love for her. p44, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *...the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June. :-- Laura remembering a quote from Woolf's 'Mrs. Dalloway.' p48, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Dalloway= The novel returns to Clarissa Vaughan who, having left the flower shop with an armload of flowers, decides to stop by Richard's apartment. On her way to Richard's she pauses at the site of a film shoot, hoping to catch a glimpse of a movie star. Eventually she leaves, having not seen the star, embarrassed at her own trivial impulses. Clarissa enters the neighbourhood she and Richard frequented as young adults. It is revealed Richard and Clarissa once had a failed experimental romantic relationship together despite it being obvious Richard's \\"deepest longings\\" were for Louis with whom he was already in a relationship. Clarissa still wonders what her life might have been if they had tried to stay together. Clarissa enters Richard's apartment building, which she finds squalid. She seems to associate Richard's apartment building with sense of decay and death. She enters Richard's apartment. Richard welcomes Clarissa, calling her \\"Mrs. D\\" a reference to 'Mrs. Dalloway'. He calls her this because of the shared first name (Clarissa Vaughan, Clarissa Dalloway) but also because of a sense of shared destiny. As Richard's closest friend, Clarissa has taken on the role of a caregiver through Richard's illness. Richard is struggling with what appears to Clarissa to be mental illness, brought about by his AIDS, and discusses hearing voices with Clarissa. While Clarissa still enjoys everyday life, it seems Richard's illness has sapped his energy for life and the cleanliness of his apartment is subsequently suffering. As Clarissa fusses about, paying attention to the details of Richard's life that he has neglected, Richard seems resigned. He does not seem to be looking forward to the party Clarissa is organising for him nearly as much as Clarissa is. Finally, Clarissa leaves promising to return in the afternoon to help him prepare for the party. =Mrs. Woolf= Meanwhile, two hours have passed since Virginia began writing the start of 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Reflecting on the uncertainty of the artistic process, she decides she has written enough for the day and is worried that if she continues her fragile mental state will become unbalanced; the onset of which she describes as her \\"headache.\\" Virginia goes to the printing room (her husband Leonard has set up a printing press, the renowned Hogarth Press which first published Sigmund Freud in English and poet T. S. Eliot) where Leonard and an assistant, Ralph are at work. She senses from Ralph's demeanour the \\"impossibly demanding\\" Leonard has just scolded him for some inefficiency. Virginia announces she is going for a walk and will then pitch in with the work. *She might see it while walking with Leonard in the square, a scintillating silver-white mass floating over the cobblestones, randomly spiked, fluid but whole, like a jellyfish. \\"What's that?\\" Leonard would ask. \\"It's my headache,\\" she'd answer. \\"Please ignore it.\\" :--Virginia reflecting on the detached nature of her mental illness. p70, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *She decides, with misgivings, that she is finished for today. Always, there are these doubts. Should she try another hour? Is she being judicious, or slothful? Judicious, she tells herself, and almost believes it. :--Virginia. p72, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *The truth, she thinks, sits calmly and plumply, dressed in matronly gray, between these two men. :-Virginia reflecting on whose attitude towards work, the carefree Ralph's, or the \\"brilliant and indefatigable\\" Leonard's, has resulted in the two men's conflict. p73, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Brown= In parallel imagery to Virginia Woolf's, Laura Brown also goes about an act of creation: making Dan's birthday cake. Richie is helping her, and Laura passes through emotions of intense love for, and annoyance with, Richie. Laura wants desperately to desire nothing more than the life she has as a wife and mother, to be making a cake, and sees both the cake-making and her present lot in life as her art, just as writing is Virginia Woolf's art: *She will not lose hope. She will not mourn her lost possibilities, her unexplored talents (what if she has no talents, after all?). She will remain devoted to her son, her husband, her home and duties, all her gifts. She will want this second child. :-Laura's thoughts, the final sentences of the chapter, p. 79, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition =Mrs. Woolf= Virginia Woolf is taking her walk while thinking of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway to have had one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented a time when she was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs. Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond. As Virginia returns home she feels, as did Laura Brown in the previous chapter, as if she is impersonating herself, as if the person she is presenting herself to be requires artifice. She puts on this 'act' to convince herself and others that she is 'sane' and so Leonard will agree with the idea of moving back to London. Virginia understands that there is \\"true art\\" in the requirement for women such as herself to act as they do. Feeling in control of her 'act' she goes to speak to the cook, Nelly, about lunch. However, Nelly, with her petty grievances and implicit demands that the daily life of running the house which is Virginia's domain, be observed, overwhelms Virginia. Nelly appears to have a matronly competence whilst Virginia does not seem to have a house-wifey bone in her body. Virginia decides to give her character, Clarissa Dalloway, the great skill with servants that she herself does not possess. *She is the author; Leonard, Nelly, Ralph, and the others are the readers. This particular novel concerns a serene, intelligent woman of painfully susceptible sensibilities who once was ill but has now recovered; who is preparing for the season in London... :--Virginia Woolf preparing to 'act' as Virginia Woolf. p83, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *Men may congratulate themselves for writing truly and passionately about the movements of nations; they may consider war and the search for God to be great literature's only subjects; but if men's standing in the world could be toppled by an ill-advised choice of hat, English literature would be dramatically changed. :--p83-4, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *The trick will be to render intact the magnitude of Clarissa's miniature but very real desperation; to fully convince the reader that, for her, domestic defeats are every bit as devastating as are lost battles to a general. :--Virginia considering how she will write 'Mrs.Dalloway. p84, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *\\"I've got the cress soup,\\" Nelly says. \\"And the pie. And then I thought just some of them yellow pears for pudding, unless you'd like something fancier.\\" Here it is, then: the challenge thrown down. Unless you'd like something fancier. So the subjugated Amazon stands on the riverbank wrapped in the fur of animals she has killed and skinned; so she drops a pear before the queen's gold slippers and says, \\"Here is what I've brought. Unless you'd like something fancier.\\" :--p85, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *...in offering pears she reminds Virginia that she, Nelly, is powerful; that she knows secrets; that queens who care more about solving puzzles in their chambers than they do about the welfare of their people must take whatever they get. :--p85, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Dalloway= Having walked back home from Richard's, Clarissa Vaughan enters her apartment. Her partner Sally, a TV producer, is on her way out the door to a lunch meeting with a film star. Suddenly, left alone, Clarissa feels unmoored. She feels as if her home and its comforts are trivial in light of the impending death of her closest friend Richard; compared to a time when she felt most alive and had everything to hope for. Her apartment is just as much a \\"realm of the dead\\" as Richard's. Like the other characters in Cunningham's novel she questions the value of her present life and whether it isn't a negation via triviality of the life she could lead. Then the feeling moves on. Clarissa is disappointed but relieved to find her life is her own and that she wants no other. She holds onto the prospect of preparing Richard's party as affirmation and begins arrangements. As Clarissa prepares for the party she thinks of the famous actor Sally is lunching with, a B-movie action star who recently came out as gay. This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is \\"only a wife\\" (p94). Clarissa tries to be grateful for the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when \\"it seemed anything could happen, anything at all\\" (p95). She thinks of kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, \\"full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself.\\" \\"Or then again maybe not,\\" Clarissa thinks. She realizes that maybe there is nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. \\"It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other.\\" *It is revealed to her that all her sorrow and loneliness, the whole creaking scaffold of it, stems simply from pretending to live in this apartment among these objects... :--Clarissa considering the possibility of escaping her present life. p92, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *I am trivial, endlessly trivial, she thinks. p94, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *Venture too far for love, she tells herself, and you renounce citizenship in the country you've made for yourself. You end up just sailing from port to port. p97, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years later, to realize that it was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk, the anticipation of dinner and a book...What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other. p98, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Brown= Laura's cake is complete but she is not happy. It is less than she had hoped it would be. She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy for the rest of the day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness \\"depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him\\". She tries to tell herself this is a good thing and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone into the pocket of her coat and walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‚Äòdesperate housewife‚Äô is interrupted by a tap on the back door. It is Kitty, Laura's neighbour. Laura is panicked and excited. She wants to see Kitty but she is unprepared, looking too much, she believes, like \\"the woman of sorrows\\". Kitty is invited in. She fits effortlessly and confidently into this post-war world of domestication, she seems to have it all. She notices Laura's amateur efforts at making a cake, just what Laura was dreading. Laura recognises her inability to fit into this domestic world, but also her inability not to care ‚Äì she is trapped between two worlds. She also recognises, however, that Kitty does not have the perfect world her confidence implies. For example, Kitty has remained barren despite her desire to have children. On the other hand, the one thing Laura seems to be excelling at in the domestic sphere is producing progeny. As the two women sip coffee Kitty admits she has to go to hospital for a few days and wants Laura to feed her pet dog. She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of what it would be like to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and the two women kiss each other on the lips. It is Kitty who pulls away and Laura is assailed by a panic. She feels she will be perceived as the predator in this astounding development, and indeed \\"Laura and Kitty agree, silently, that this is true.\\" She also realizes her son, Richie, has been watching everything. However Kitty is already on her way out the door, her momentary lapse of character wiped from memory. Nothing is mentioned of the kiss, she brushes off Laura's continued overtures of help politely, and leaves. Laura's world has been jolted. It is too much. It is like a Virginia Woolf novel, too full. Attempting to return to the world she knows, she attends to her son and, without hesitation, dumps her freshly made cake in the bin. She will make another cake, a better one. *Why, she wonders, does it seem that she could give him anything, anything at all, and receive essentially the same response. What does he desire nothing, really, beyond what he's already got?...This, she reminds herself, is a virtue. :--Laura ruminates on Dan's relentless contentedness. p100, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *Her cake is a failure, but she is loved anyway. She is loved, she thinks, in more or less the way the gifts will be appreciated: because they've been given with good intentions, because they exist, because they are part of a world in which one wants what one gets\\". p100-101, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *Why did she marry him? She married him out of love. She married him out of guilt; out of fear of being alone; out of patriotism. :--Laura reflects on the complex reasons she married Dan. p106, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *The question has been silently asked and silently answered, it seems. They are both afflicted and blessed, full of shared secrets, striving every moment. They are both impersonating someone. They are weary and beleaguered; they have taken on such enormous work. :--Laura and Kitty embrace in the kitchen. p110, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Woolf= As Virginia helps Leonard and Ralph with the printing press, a servant announces Virginia's sister has arrived. Vanessa, Virginia's sister, is one-and-a-half hours early. Leonard refuses to stop working, so Virginia attends to Vanessa alone. At this time, the viewer realizes her mental problems create a fear for the maids. Virginia and Vanessa go out into the garden where Vanessa's children found a dying bird. Vanessa, mirroring the character of Kitty in the Mrs. Brown vignettes, has an effortless competence with life's details, be it servants or children; this highlights Virginia's own awkwardness with her lot in life. Virginia believes, as she watches Vanessa's children, that the real accomplishment in life is not her \\"experiments in narrative\\" but the producing of children, which Vanessa achieved. Virginia is out of place in such a society. The bird the children found has died, and the children, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is aware that she and the little girl are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably laughing at the females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide. *Virginia looks with unanticipated pleasure at this modest circlet of thorns and flowers; this wild deathbed. She would like to lie down on it herself. :--A bird's funeral suddenly becomes the occasion for Virginia to ponder her own deathwish. p119, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. *Virginia lingers another moment beside the dead bird in its circle of roses. It could be a kind of hat. It could be the missing link between millinery and death. :--Virginia humorously seeing both the everyday and the profundity in life's events. p121, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. =Mrs. Dalloway= As Clarissa prepares for Richard's party, determined to give him the perfect tribute despite its probable triviality, she is visited by none other than Richard's old partner Louis. The visit mirrors those of Kitty and Vanessa in the other story vignettes. Clarissa is thrown off-kilter by the visit, as Laura had been by Kitty and Virginia had been by Vanessa.

Major themes =LGBT issues= The Hours concerns three generations of questionably lesbian or bisexual women. Virginia Woolf was known to have affairs with women; Laura Brown kisses Kitty in her kitchen, and Clarissa Vaughan is in a relationship with Sally, and was previously Richard's lover. Peripheral characters also exhibit a variety of sexual orientations. To some extent the novel examines the freedom with which successive generations have been able to express their sexuality, to the public and even to themselves. As such, a definable sexuality for the characters of Virginia Woolf and Laura Brown is hard to ascertain. It could be argued, as does the author Michael Cunningham himself on the DVD commentary of the film version of 'The Hours', that were such characters born at later times in different circumstances they would come out as lesbians. For Virginia and Laura it would have been extremely difficult to \\"come out.\\" Such a position would have meant extreme consequences in societies where homosexuality was in many cases illegal, treated with extreme medical 'therapies', and shunned by society. This can be understood to provide much of the undercurrent of anguish for the characters, particularly in Laura Brown's case. Without this understanding, Laura could be conceived as ungrateful or a drama queen (as indeed many readers regarded Virginia Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway when Mrs.Dalloway was first published). =Mental illness= Cunningham's novel suggests, to some extent, that perceived mental illness can be a legitimate expression of perspective. The idea that sanity is a matter of perspective can be seen in Virginia Woolf's censoring of her true self because this will appear as insanity to others, even to herself; Cunningham's modern- day readership is able to understand Virginia's state of mind as other than 'insane': \\"She has learned over the years that sanity involves a certain measure of impersonation, not simply for the benefit of husband and servants but for the sake, first and foremost, of one's own convictions.\\"‚ÄîVirginia Woolf. p83, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition. Suicide is also a major theme in each story in the novel. =Patterns of three= Apart from the novel's three female protagonists, and the three symbiotic storylines that they appear in, there are other examples in the novel where Cunningham patterns his story on groups of three. Most conspicuous of all is the threeway relationship that once existed between Clarissa, Richard and Louis when they were three students on holiday together. In the 'Mrs. Woolf' storyline there is another grouping of three (biographically factual) in Vanessa's three children, Quentin, Julian, and Angelica, who come with their mother to visit Virginia. Then there is the nuclear family of three we find in Laura Brown, her husband Dan, and their son Richie. Michael Cunningham has admitted to his preoccupation with the number three in a televised interview with Charlie Rose.Charlie Rose, A conversation with author Michael Cunningham (8/17/2005) Its occurrence is prominent in the structures and character relationships of two further novels by Cunningham, Specimen Days and A Home at the End of the World. Trivia *On her way to Richard's apartment, Clarissa Vaughan thinks she sees Meryl Streep. Meryl Streep ended up playing Clarissa Vaughan in Stephen Daldry's movie adaptation of The Hours. In the book, Clarissa Vaughan considers it might also have been Vanessa Redgrave that she saw. (Redgrave plays the part of Clarissa Dalloway in the 1997 film version of Mrs Dalloway.) *As Streep comments in The Hours DVD commentary, it was Redgrave's late daughter, Natasha Richardson, who first sent her a copy of the novel. Richardson apparently felt that Streep might enjoy reading about her fictional self in the novel. *Mrs. Brown is a character in Virginia Woolf's essay, \\"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\\". *Two anachronisms are presented by Cunningham in his book. The first is on page 30 (1998 edition) where he writes of Virginia Woolf, \\"She rises from her bed and goes into the bathroom.\\" Hogarth House was built in 1720 and in 1923, it did not have a bathroom, only an outhouse. The second is on p. 43 where Mrs. Brown in 1949 sees \\"beside the roses stand cereal box and milk carton...\\" Although Lucerne Dairy did have milk cartons in 1938, they did not come into common use until the 1960s. These are both corrected in the film; Woolf is depicted using a ewer and basin to wash in the morning, and the Browns have milk in a bottle. *Cunningham writes that Ralph Partridge husband of Dora Carrington is working at the Hogarth Press in 1923, however, it was \\"just before Christmas, [Ralph Partridge] split with the Hogarth Press\\".\\"Carrington-A Life\\", Gretchen Holbrook Gerzine, 1989, p.198. He did train Marjorie Joad in January and February 1923 as his replacement, but Cunningham writes as if he is working there still permanently. Cunningham writes on p. 72 (1998 edition), \\"already Marjorie has been hired...to do the jobs Ralph considers beneath him.\\" However, Ralph had already quit.

Definition  The formalization of computability theory by Kleene led to a particular universal partial computable function Œ®(e, x) defined using the T predicate. This function is universal in the sense that it is partial computable, and for any partial computable function f there is an e such that, for all x, f(x) = Œ®(e,x), where the equality means that either both sides are undefined or both are defined and are equal. It is common to write œàe(x) for Œ®(e,x); thus the sequence œà0, œà1, ... is an enumeration of all partial computable functions. Such enumerations are formally called computable numberings of the partial computable functions. An arbitrary numbering Œ∑ of partial functions is defined to be an admissible numbering if: * The function H(e,x) = Œ∑e(x) is a partial computable function. * There is a total computable function f such that, for all e, Œ∑e = œàf(e). * There is a total computable function g such that, for all e, œàe = Œ∑g(e). Here, the first bullet requires the numbering to be computable; the second requires that any index for the numbering Œ∑ can be converted effectively to an index to the numbering œà; and the third requires that any index for the numbering œà can be effectively converted to an index for the numbering Œ∑.  Rogers' equivalence theorem  Hartley Rogers, Jr. showed that a numbering Œ∑ of the partial computable functions is admissible if and only if there is a total computable bijection p such that, for all Œ∑e = œàp(e) (Soare 1987:25).

The most frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in the 1970s and 1980s, Brenner \\"was a pioneer of observational comedy.\\" His friend, comedian Richard Lewis, described Brenner as \\"the king of hip, observational comedy.\\" Early life Brenner was born to Jewish parents in 1936Happy birthday Brenner! Howard Stern and raised in South and West Philadelphia. His father, Louis, was a vaudeville comedian, singer and dancer, performing under the stage name of Lou Murphy, who gave up his career and a film contract to please Brenner's grandfather, a rabbi, who objected to his working on the Sabbath. Once David became successful, he regularly sent his parents on cruises, and both of Brenner's parents would eventually die at advanced ages while on cruises aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, approximately two years apart. After high school, Brenner spent two years in the U.S. Army, serving in the 101st Airborne and as a cryptographer of the 595th Signal Corps in B√∂blingen, Germany. After being discharged, he attended Temple University, where he majored in mass communication and graduated with honors. Career Brenner was a writer, director or producer of 115 television documentaries and headed the documentary units of Westinghouse Broadcasting and Metromedia, winning nearly 30 awards including an Emmy, before moving to comedy. His first paid gig was at The Improv in June 1969, and following that he frequently performed at clubs in Greenwich Village. Brenner was ranked No. 53 on Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time. At one point, he had appeared more often on major TV talk shows than any other entertainer.The Book of Lists #2 p. 203. He also wrote five books, and starred in four HBO Specials. = Books = Brenner released the comedy album Excuse Me, Are You Reading That Paper? on MCA Records in 1983 (The title arose from a gag wherein a fellow passenger on a subway asked Brenner if he was reading a newspaper on which he was sitting. Brenner stood up, turned the page, sat down and said, \\"Well, yes I am.\\") Brenner also penned five books including Soft Pretzels With Mustard (1983), Revenge is the Best Exercise (1984), Nobody Ever Sees You Eat Tuna Fish (1986), If God Wanted Us to Travel... (1990), and I Think There's a Terrorist in My Soup: How to Survive Personal and World Problems with Laughter‚ÄîSeriously (2003) which was also released as two audiobooks. = Television = After making his national television debut in 1971, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, he became the show's most frequent guest, with 158 appearances. He guest-hosted for Johnny Carson 75 times between 1975 and 1984, placing him fifth on the list of Carson's most frequent guest hosts. Brenner was the star of the 1976 TV series Snip (alternative title: Flip), which was inspired by the film Shampoo and set in a hair dressing salon. The situation comedy was cancelled by NBC before it aired due to its inclusion in the supporting cast what would have been one of the first gay characters in an American situation comedy. In 1986, King World Entertainment gave Brenner his own 30-minute syndicated late- night talk show, Nightlife, in an attempt to compete with Carson, but it was cancelled after one season. The show premiered September 8, 1986, on 102 stations and was touted as \\"alternative\\". Filmed in Manhattan and featuring a casually dressed Brenner, it was unique among the late night talk genre for not having a monologue. It gave some comedians, such as Bobby Slayton, their national television premieres. In addition to the Tonight Show, Brenner also appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The David Frost Show, The Mike Douglas Show, Late Night with David Letterman and the Late Show With David Letterman, Real Time With Bill Maher and The Daily Show and was a frequent guest on The Howard Stern Show. In later years he appeared on both MSNBC and Fox News Channel shows commenting on current events. = Film = He portrayed a charity ball auctioneer in the 1989 romantic comedy Worth Winning (with Mark Harmon, Madeleine Stowe, and Lesley Ann Warren, who was also Brenner's co-star on Snip). = Radio = From 1994 to 1996, Brenner hosted a talk-radio program, taking over the timeslot of the long-running Larry King Show on the Mutual Broadcasting System. He had earlier hosted a syndicated weekly radio show, David Brenner Live, for three months in 1985. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia named Brenner their Person of the Year in 1984 and inducted him into their Hall of Fame in 2003. Personal life Brenner had three children‚ÄîCole, Slade and Wyatt.David Brenner: Back with a Vengeance!, 2000, HBO. He and the mother of Cole, his first son, fought a custody battle for several years. Brenner finally won child custody in 1992. Because family courts would have regarded him as an absentee father if he were away from home more than 50 nights a year, Brenner substantially reduced the number of appearances in his stand-up comedy work, including performances on the Tonight Show, in order to secure and maintain custody of his son. Brenner married Elizabeth Slater of New York, the mother of his sons Slade and Wyatt, in the closing minutes of his David Brenner: Back with a Vengeance! HBO Special recorded in Las Vegas, on February 19, 2000. They divorced a little over a year later and also then fought two custody battles, both of which Brenner won. Brenner was engaged to Tai Babilonia in 2005, but they never married. For a while in the 2000s, Brenner lived in Las Vegas. Death Brenner died on March 15, 2014, at age 78 from pancreatic cancer at his Manhattan home.

In the 11th and 12th Centuries the Valser valley was extensively used by the local Romansh. Vals is first mentioned in mid 12th Century as in Valle. About 1290 they were 4 to 7 farm houses with flocks of sheep. In the 13th Century, the Walser were driven from the canton of Wallis in south-west Switzerland into the Valser valley. The expansion of the Walliser German speaking Walser stopped in 1457 when they were forbidden from marrying or buying land from the Romansh speaking locals. They were able to settle at the end of the valley because that was the only place that wasn't claimed. The Walser also brought with them the Valliser style of house, which uses more wood than stone and has triangular roofs. =St. Martin= The village was settled around the 14th Century by Walser immigrants. Initially it was a held in fief for the Bishop of Chur by the von Tersnaus and von Mont families. In 1457 the German-speaking population was forbidden from purchasing land or marrying in the neighboring village of Tersnaus. The village church (consecrated 1345) was initially under the parish church of St. Vinzenz in Pleif (in Vella municipality), but in 1528 came under the authority of Tersnaus. After 1776, St. Martin's village church had a German-speaking Prebend though in 1868 it fell back under the authority of Tersnaus. By 1671 the farm houses of St. Martin's were a neighborhood in Tersnaus, and in 1878 the municipality separated from Tersnaus to become politically independent. The municipality remained firmly rural, and in 1972-73 became the last municipality in Switzerland to be connected to the electric grid.

He modeled it on Big Ben in London.The foundation stone was laid on 1 March 1869 and construction was completed in November 1878. The total cost of construction came to ‚Çπ550,000, a large amount of money for the time period. A portion of the total cost of construction was donated by Premchand Roychand, a prosperous broker who founded the Bombay Stock Exchange on the condition that the tower be named after his mother Rajabai. Premchand Roychand's mother was blind and as a staunch follower of Jain religion, she was supposed to consume her dinner before evening. Legend says that the evening bell of the tower helped her to know the time without anyone's help. The tower was closed to the public after it became a frequent spot for those attempting to commit suicide. Structure The tower was built in a fusion of Venetian and Gothic styles. It is built out of the locally available buff coloured Kurla stone.

He played college football at Michigan, where he was a two-time consensus All-American, and was drafted by the Miami Dolphins first overall in the 2008 NFL Draft. He also played for the St. Louis Rams, Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings. In high school, Long was the first player in his high school's history to earn all-state \\"Dream Team\\" (all-class state team) honors in football from the Detroit News. He was a two-time first-team All-Metro League player in both basketball and football, where he was honored both on offense and defense. In baseball, he was a two-time second-team All-Metro League selection. In both basketball and football, he led his team to regular and post season success that had not been seen in many years. At the University of Michigan, he redshirted for a year and then became a starter at offensive tackle for the football team in the third game of his redshirt freshman season. He earned second-team All-Big Ten Conference recognition and Rivals.com Freshman All-American recognition. In 2006 and 2007, he earned Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year and first-team All-Big Ten recognition. In 2006, he was an Outland and Lombardi Award watch lists selection and in 2007 he was a finalist for both awards. He was a consensus first-team All-American in 2006 and 2007. After being drafted by Miami, he became an immediate starter and started every game that the team played. At the conclusion of his rookie season, he was selected to numerous All-Rookie teams and was a substitute Pro Bowl selection. Long followed up on a successful rookie season by earning Pro Bowl roster spots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Early years Long was born in Lapeer, Michigan, the son of John and Denise Long. He attended Lapeer East High School, where he was the first player in his high school's history to earn all-state \\"Dream Team\\" (all-class state team) honors in football. In baseball, he played first base. He played basketball, baseball and football in high school. Long was a 2001 Flint, Michigan All-Metro League lineman on both sides of the ball as a defensive end and offensive lineman. And in Lapeer East's final game of the 2001 season, Long rushed for three touchdowns. As a junior that football season, he was listed at , . In Long's first start as a varsity basketball player on December 4, 2001, he led all scorers although he only scored one first half point. That season, he helped lead Lapeer East to an unbeaten 14‚Äì0 Metro League record (17‚Äì3) overall as they prepared for the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) tournament. It was the first unbeaten Metro League season by any team since 1989 and Lapeer East's first unbeaten season since 1980. Long was an All-Metro league first team selection, but his team lost in the 2002 Class A district semifinal on the road. By the end of the basketball season, he was listed at , . As a junior, he was a second-team All-Metro League baseball selection as an infielder. By the end of his junior year, he had already set the school home run record in baseball and was the fifth-ranked high school football prospect in the state of Michigan (future Michigan teammate and co-captain LaMarr Woodley was number one). After his junior year of high school, he attended the University of Michigan football camp, which ran from June 16‚Äì21. At the conclusion of the camp, Michigan Wolverines football head coach Lloyd Carr offered him a scholarship as an offensive tackle. Long, who was a lifelong Michigan Wolverines fan, responded with a verbal commitment. At the time, Long weighed and Michigan hoped he would bulk up to by the time he arrived. Long had made official visits to Michigan, Michigan State, Notre Dame, Ohio State and Purdue. In his 2002 senior season, Long helped lead Lapeer East to their first season opener win since 1995 and their first state playoff appearance since 1993. That season, the football team set a school record by posting a nine-game winning streak, which started after an October 6, 2001 loss the prior year. The team achieved its first state playoff win in its 27-year history that season. The team's 9‚Äì2 record was the best in school history, and Long was again chosen as an All-Metro League selection on both offense and defense. That season, he became the first Lapeer East player selected to the All-state Dream Team in 2002. Although he was All-State as a lineman, Long often lined up at fullback and accumulated four career touchdowns. He finished the season as the number two football prospect in the state behind Woodley according to the Detroit News. Long led the basketball team to a second consecutive undefeated Metro League championship season, which was the first repeat league champion since 1996 and Lapeer East's first repeat championship since 1982. Long was again first-team All-Metro League, and he was selected as an honorable mention 2003 Associated Press Class A All-State basketball player. Long was again a second- team All-Metro League selection as a first baseman. Following his senior season, Long was selected to play in the 23rd annual Michigan High School All- Star Football Game on July 26 at Michigan State University. College career 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team huddle with No. 86 Mario Manningham, No. 7 Chad Henne, No. 16 Adrian Arrington, No. 72 Rueben Riley, No. 54 Mark Bihl, No. 77 Long Long accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, where he played for head coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football team from 2003 to 2007. As a freshman, Long was on the 2003 Michigan Wolverines football team roster, but Tony Pape and Adam Stenavich were the starting offensive tackles. He was redshirted for the year as he bulked up to . Long traveled with the team to the 2004 Rose Bowl, but did not play in the game. On June 16, 2004, following his freshman year, he was hospitalized in an intensive-care unit for smoke inhalation injuries when a house rented by nine Michigan Wolverine players caught fire. Long, sleeping in his bedroom on the second floor of the house, awoke to the sound of fire alarms. He attempted to exit his room through the door, but was forced back by smoke. Long then knocked out the screen of a window and jumped out of the building. Covered in soot, Long had escaped the fire, landing two stories below on a roommate's parked car. Later at the hospital, Long underwent procedures that required tubes be put down his throat to suction black phlegm from his lungs. The tubes also performed Long's breathing while he lay unconscious for the first few days. He was released from the University of Michigan Medical Center and was able to spend Father's Day (June 20) back in Lapeer. As a sophomore member of the 2004 Michigan Wolverines football team, Long competed with senior Dave Schoonover and juniors Mike Kolodzieg, Rueben Riley, and Mike Barishaj for the starting position vacated by the graduated Pape. Long impressed the coaches by playing through a turf toe injury. The battle came down to him and Kolodzieg. Long made his Michigan debut on September 4, 2004, in a 43‚Äì10 victory over Miami University. He made the travel squad, but he did not play against Notre Dame in the Michigan ‚Äì Notre Dame rivalry game the following week at Notre Dame Stadium. Kolodzieg started the first two games, but Michigan averaged only 85.5 yards rushing, which ranked 94th nationally among 117 Division I teams. Long became a starter in the third game on September 18 against the San Diego State Aztecs football team. Over the course of the season, he started eight games and Kolodzieg started 4 at right offensive tackle. Kolodzieg also started one game at left tackle. A week after Long was moved into the starting lineup, David Baas was moved from left offensive guard‚Äîwhere he had been a 2003 second team All- American‚Äîto center so that Leo Henige, Jr. could enter the starting lineup. After the move, Baas was the co-Rimington Trophy winner that season. The team finished the season as the 2004 Big Ten Conference Co-Champions and were awarded the Big Ten Conference's Bowl Championship Series Bowl game bid. By the time Michigan was preparing for the 2005 Rose Bowl, the team was averaging 156.18 rushing yards per game, which ranked 56th in the nation. Long earned a second team All-Big Ten Conference recognition from the coaches, while linemates guard Matt Lentz, tackle Adam Stenavich and tight end Tim Massaquoi were first-team selections. Baas was Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year. Long also received honorable mention All-Big Ten recognition from the media. Long and teammates Chad Henne and Mike Hart were named to Rivals.com's 2004 Freshman All-America first team. Long had post-season shoulder surgery and missed 2005 spring practice. In fact, because of the large number of injured players, the team canceled the culminating spring practice intrasquad scrimmage game and instead held an open practice in which players participated in drills. In August 2005, Long suffered an ankle injury and was sidelined as the 2005 Michigan Wolverines football team's season began. The injury had been caused in training camp when he was zone blocking alongside center Mark Bihl, who got tangled up with nose tackle Gabe Watson. The two fell against the outside of Long's leg and rolled over it. The injury required surgery. Long did not return to the lineup until October 22 on the third possession against the Iowa Hawkeyes. He was the lead blocker on the game-winning overtime touchdown. He started the game the subsequent week against the Northwestern Wildcats. Two weeks later, following a bye week, Long got injured during the first half against the Indiana Hoosiers, and his foot was put in a protective boot. The second foot injury was expected to end his season. He appeared in the subsequent rivalry game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, and during the first play, he opposed Bobby Carpenter and Carpenter got a broken leg. After the game, Long appeared to need immediate surgery, which would have caused him to miss the 2005 Alamo Bowl. By the time of the game on December 28, though, he was ready to play. As the team prepared for 2006 spring practice, the left- handed Long was moved from right tackle to left tackle where he would be protecting the blindside of right-handed quarterbacks. 2007 co-captain, Long participated in opening coin tosses along with Mike Hart, Shawn Crable and Brandent Englemon. Long entered the season for the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team listed on numerous preseason conference and national teams as well as watchlists for awards such as the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Trophy. He was on the preseason Outland Trophy watch list along with Levi Brown, Joe Thomas, Justin Blalock, and Herbert Taylor. Long was considered the heart of the Michigan offense, and his teammates voted the redshirt junior to be a co- captain along with senior Woodley. Before the season started, Carr replaced offensive coordinator Terry Malone with Mike DeBord who had previously been offensive coordinator from 1997‚Äì1999. Following the 7‚Äì5 2005 season which was the worst Michigan season since 1984's 6‚Äì6-year, there was pressure on Carr to turn things around and he sought a lighter, faster and better conditioned team. During the offseason, Long reduced his weight from to to improve his agility, speed and conditioning. Under the new coordinator and with fitter athletes, the offensive scheme was shifted to concentrate on the zone blocking system. The system was similar to the one used by the Denver Broncos when they won back-to-back Super Bowls and by the Atlanta Falcons to help Warrick Dunn achieve a career-high in rushing yards while the team led the NFL in rushing yards in consecutive seasons. By mid-November, Michigan had flourished under the new system with an 11‚Äì0 record, and some of the credit for the success was attributed to Long, the team captain and offensive leader. Long was recognized as a first-team All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media and was selected as the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year. Long was also part of a Michigan record-setting three American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-America Team selections along with Woodley and Leon Hall. Long was a consensus (meaning at least half of the recognized lists, which are AP, AFCA, FWAA, TSN, and the WCFF selected him) 2006 College Football All-America Team first-team selection by Associated Press (AP), AFCA, Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Walter Camp Football Foundation, Sports Illustrated, Pro Football Weekly, ESPN, CBS Sports, Rivals.com, Scout.com. He was a second-team All-American selection by the College Football News. Long was the first offensive lineman who was a Michigan high school graduate selected to the first-team by the FWAA since Paul Seymour was selected to the 1972 College Football All-America Team. Long was believed to be a likely mid to high first round selection if he had chosen to declare himself eligible for the 2007 NFL Draft, but he chose to use his last year of collegiate eligibility and stay for a fifth year. His decision to stay was what convinced Hart to stay in college. Michigan opposed the 2006 USC Trojans football team in the 2007 Rose Bowl and the offensive line that had surrendered 18 quarterback sacks in the first 12 games, allowed 6 in the 32‚Äì18 loss to finish the season 11‚Äì2. Long became a member of senior honorary society Order of Angell. Ohio State Long was a co-captain of the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team, and he again began the season on the Outland Trophy and Rotary Lombardi Award watch lists. He was elected to serve as tri-captain along with Hart and Shawn Crable. Entering the season, the team was picked by the Big Ten media members to win the conference. The season was eagerly anticipated with returning seniors Long, Hart and Chad Henne in key roles, but the season quickly began to fall apart when the team lost to the two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers in the opening game. The loss put Long in a position of having to defend his coach and teammates to ESPN and the nation. In the second game, the team suffered its worst defeat since 1968 and its first consecutive home losses to start the season since 1959. This presented a leadership challenge to Long as team captain. As Michigan won its next eight games, Long was described in the press as the team's most valuable player and an offensive lineman who should be considered for the Heisman Trophy since he was likely to be the first overall pick in the NFL draft. In early November, Long was named one of four finalists (along with Glenn Dorsey, Chris Long, James Laurinaitis) for the Lombardi award that Woodley had won the year before. He was named as an Outland Trophy finalist along with Dorsey and Anthony Collins. When the win streak ended the week before his final Michigan‚ÄìOhio State game, he accepted the blame on behalf of the offensive line although the teams offensive stars were injured. At the conclusion of the Big Ten Conference schedule, he was selected again as first-team All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media and as the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year. Long, Michael Crabtree and Darren McFadden were the only unanimous offensive 2007 College Football All-America Team selections by AP, AFCA, FWAA, Walter Camp, Sporting News, Sports Illustrated, Pro Football Weekly, ESPN, CBS Sports, College Football News, Rivals.com, and Scout.com. In coach Carr's final game before retirement and Long's final game as a Wolverine, the team won the 2008 Capital One Bowl against the Florida Gators in a game that included an attempted Jake Long tackle eligible screen pass. Long declined an invitation to participate in the 2008 Senior Bowl. From February 21‚Äì24, 2008, Long attended the NFL Combine, where he excelled. Professional career Long with the Dolphins in 2009. =2008 NFL Draft= Regarded as the top offensive tackle available in the 2008 NFL Draft, Long drew comparisons to Ryan Tucker. His 37 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press tied Vernon Gholston for the highest total at the 2008 NFL Combine. In addition to being one of eight offensive tackles drafted in the first round that year, Long was only the third offensive tackle ever to be taken with the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, after Hall of Famer Orlando Pace (1997, a 5-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 2000s) and Hall of Famer Ron Yary (1968, an 8-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 1970s). The Dolphins drafted Long's college teammate, quarterback Chad Henne, in the second round of the draft with the 57th overall pick. =Miami Dolphins= More than two weeks before the 2008 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins, who owned the right to make the first selection in the draft determined that they wanted to negotiate with Long to be their pick and met with Tom Condon, Long's sports agent. On April 22, 2008, in advance of the April 26 and 27 draft, Long agreed to a five-year, $57.75 million deal with the Miami Dolphins. The deal included $30 million in guaranteed money and made Long the first overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. This made him, as of that date, the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history. At Dolphins minicamp on May 2, Long was assigned number 79 and he thought he would have to negotiate with Drew Mormino for the number 77 that he had worn since high school. However, after he failed his physical exam, Mormino was released from the team, and before training camp Long was assigned number 77. Dolphins in 2012 Long's ascension with the Dolphins was part of an effort to overhaul the offensive line that had allowed 42 sacks and produced the 29th-rated of 32 offenses the previous season. The Dolphins hired new coach Tony Sparano and employed Bill Parcells as Executive Vice President in charge of football operations. Long was immediately slated to play left tackle. He was the only rookie expected to be a starter for the 2008 Miami Dolphins. According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, at the end of training camp, Long was one of three rookies listed as first-string on the depth chart. Long was nominated for Rookie of the Week in the tenth week of the 2008 season, but lost out to Broncos WR Eddie Royal. Other players who were nominated for rookie of the week that same week were Matt Ryan, Benjarvus Green-Ellis, and Joe Flacco. At the end of the season, Long was selected to nine All-rookie teams by Pro Football Writers Association, Draft.com, Draftsinders.com, Draftseason.com, Sports Network, Fannation, Sporting News, Scout.com and Ourlads Scouting Service. On January 20, 2009, Long was selected to the 2009 Pro Bowl, replacing Jason Peters for the AFC's squad. Long gave up just 2.5 sacks his rookie season, compared to the 11.5 allowed by Peters in 2008. In 2009, Long yielded only 4 sacks and was ranked the second best offensive tackle. He was selected as a starter for the 2010 Pro Bowl. He was not selected to the first team All-Pro losing out to Ryan Clady, who gave up 8 sacks, and Joe Thomas, who is ranked the best offensive tackle in the NFL. Long was selected to the second team All-Pro and was named a starter for the AFC Pro Bowl. Long joins Richmond Webb as the only Dolphins offensive tackles to be named starters in the Pro Bowl and is the first Dolphins offensive lineman to be named to back-to-back Pro Bowls since Webb played in seven straight from 1990 to 1996. Long did not participate in the game due to injury and was replaced on the Pro Bowl roster by D'Brickashaw Ferguson. The following season Long was named as a starter for the 2011 Pro Bowl, while Ferguson was named as a reserve. During the 2011 NFL season, Long's 61 games started streak snapped when he suffered a back ailment. Subsequently, he was placed on injured reserve with a torn right biceps for the final week of the season. The roster move came one day after he was selected to the 2012 Pro Bowl. He was named as a Pro Bowl starter for the third consecutive season. He missed the Pro Bowl for the 2011 season. However, he was named the Dolphins' Ed Block Courage Award recipient. In addition, he was listed as the 59th player on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012. =St. Louis Rams= Long with the St. Louis Rams in 2013 During the 2013 NFL offseason, Long became a free agent. He received two contract offers: an extension from the Miami Dolphins, and a contract from the Rams. On March 17, 2013, Long signed a four-year, $36 million contract with the Rams. At the October 6, 2013, contest against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Rams gave the first 15,000 fans to arrive at the game free Jake Long figurines. On December 22, 2013, Long sustained a torn ACL against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and he missed the last game of the season. On October 26, 2014, Long sustained another torn ACL against the Kansas City Chiefs and he missed the rest of the season. He was released along with center Scott Wells on the eve of free agency on March 9, 2015. Long was coming off of back-to-back seasons with torn ACLs and was about to cost the Rams $10 million against the salary cap. =Atlanta Falcons= On September 15, 2015, Long signed a one-year, $1,568,750 contract with the Atlanta Falcons. He played 11 snaps for the Falcons in the 2015 season. =Baltimore Ravens= On July 26, 2016, Long agreed on a 1-year deal with the Baltimore Ravens. Due to concerns over his surgically repaired knee, the Ravens requested that Long sign an injury waiver. Long declined the request and never signed the contract, making him a free agent. =Minnesota Vikings= On October 11, 2016, Long was signed by the Vikings. He suffered a torn achilles against the Redskins in Week 10 and was placed on injured reserve on November 15, 2016. =Retirement= On April 24, 2017, Long announced his retirement from the NFL. Personal life After surviving the fire during his second year of college, Long got a tattoo of Saint Joseph on his right bicep. His aunt had placed a card of the saint under his pillow while he was in the hospital in intensive care. He also has a tattoo of the family name on his other arm. Long has two brothers: John and Joseph (\\"Joe\\"). Joe Long attended Wayne State University. Jake Long married his college sweetheart, Jacqueline Laurian, on March 10, 2012.

Prezan led the Romanian Armed Forces in the Battle of Bucharest (November‚ÄìDecember 1916), and as those forces retreated into the northeastern part of Romania (Moldavia). In July and August 1917, Prezan, who was by then Chief of the General Staff (and assisted by the then- Lieutenant-Colonel Ion Antonescu) successfully stopped the German invasion led by Field Marshal August von Mackensen. He continued serving in this position until 1920. Documents found in military archives have brought to light Prezan's role in creating the Romanian National State. In October 1916, Prezan was rewarded with the Order of Michael the Brave, Third Class for deeds of merit, courage, and devotion. In July 1917, when he commanded the General Army Quarters, Prezan was honoured with the Order of Michael the Brave, Second Class. During the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War (November 1918‚ÄìMarch 1920), Prezan led the Romanian Armed Forces in the battles of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania.

Scientific American. v. 7, no. 38, p. 298 (June 5, 1852) about Dorchester pot. Note the tongue-in-cheek reference to \\"Tubal Cain\\", who was said to be the first blacksmith (Genesis 4:19-24) The Dorchester Pot was a metal vase-like object that was recovered in two pieces after an explosion used to break up rock at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1852. According to text reprinted from the Boston Transcript, a local paper, in the June 5, 1852 Scientific American, the two pieces were found, loose among debris thrown out by the explosion. Apparently, it was inferred from the locations of the two pieces of this pot among the explosion debris that this pot had been blasted from solid puddingstone (conglomerate), which is part of the Roxbury Conglomerate, from about 10 feet below the surface of Meeting House Hill. The story has been used by creationists and fringe theorists as evidence that conventional models of geology or the length of the human presence on earth are wrong. Mainstream commentators identify it as a Victorian era candlestick or pipe holder. Geological context The Roxbury Conglomerate, from which this pot is alleged to have come, has been dated as having accumulated between 570 and 593 million years ago and during the Ediacaran Period.Thompson, M.D., A.M.

Metamorphism has significantly altered the Roxbury Conglomerate to sub-greenschist facies and created within it a well-developed and closely spaced slaty cleavage that is oriented approximately perpendicular to bedding. Tectonism has also flattened, stretched, indented, and fractured the pebbles and associated matrix of the Roxbury Conglomerate to the point that it often has the appearance of flow structure.Mansfield, G.

The body of this object was said to resemble zinc alloyed with silver in color. Its description said that \\"On the sides there are six figures of a flower, or bouquet, beautifully inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part of the vessel a vine, or wreath, inlaid also with silver.\\" The primary source of information about this object, provides neither any picture of nor age estimate for the Dorchester Pot. Fringe theories The Dorchester Pot is often discussed as an out-of- place artifact by various popular books and articles about unsolved mysteries, alternative science, and different types of creationism. As part of a short description, an image purporting to be of the Dorchester Pot appears on page 46 of the 1985 Reader's Digest Association book Mysteries of the Unexplained.Marshall, W., M. Dvais, V.

It takes its name from the House of Guelph, of which the Hanoverians were a branch. Since Hanover and the United Kingdom shared a monarch until 1837, the order was frequently bestowed upon British subjects. History Until 1837 the order was frequently awarded to officers in the British Navy and Army, although it was still classed as a foreign order, with British members of the order not entitled to style themselves as \\"Sir\\" unless they were also created Knights Bachelor, as many were. Examples of KCH's created Knight Batchelor. The British link ended in 1837 when Hanover's royal union with Great Britain ended, with Ernest Augustus becoming King of Hanover and Queen Victoria ascending the British throne. When Hanover was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866, the order continued as a house order to be awarded by the Royal House of Hanover. Today, its current Sovereign is the Hanoverian head of the house, Ernst August, Prince of Hanover. Classes The insignia was based on the white horse on Hanover's arms. The Order includes two divisions, Civil and Military, the latter indicated by crossed swords on both the badge and star. It originally had three classes, but with several reorganisations since 1841, as house order today it has four classes and an additional Cross of Merit. In descending order of seniority the classes are: =1815‚Äì1841= * Knight Grand Cross (GCH). Received a collar chain and badge, a star worn on the left breast, and a badge worn from sash over the right shoulder. * Knight Commander (KCH). A neck badge worn from a ribbon, with a breast star, smaller than that for the GCH. * Knight (KH). Wore the badge on the left breast. Versions in both gold and silver were awarded. Holders of the respective degrees of the order in Britain were entitled to be post-nominally addressed with the initials, which stand for Knight Grand Cross of Hanover, Knight Commander of Hanover and Knight of Hanover. The initial GCG was also used, and was cited in the original statutes of the order. Gold and silver medals were attached to the order, for award to those not eligible for the order itself, including non commissioned officers and royal servants. =After 1841= *Grand Cross *Commander 1st Class *Commander 2nd Class *Knight *Cross of Merit The Order =Officers= The Order has six officers: the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar, the King of Arms, the Genealogist, and the Secretary.

Head founded the ski (and later tennis racquet) making firm Head in 1950. Later he became chairman of Prince Manufacturing Inc. The U.S. patents for the laminate skis and oversized tennis racket are in the name of Howard Head. Ski equipment  A Head Ski Company alpine ski, 2006 model. In 1947, Howard Head was an aircraft engineer for Glenn L. Martin Company in Baltimore, and went skiing for the first time. Head was frustrated with the quality of the clumsy and heavy wooden skis, which made skiing very difficult for beginners. He decided to develop a lighter and more efficient ski that could make skiing much easier for everyone. He left his job and devoted all his time and energy to developing the skis and supported himself with earnings from poker. The skis developed by Head were based on the structural principles that he had learned during his experience as an aircraft engineer. In a warehouse he rented from Albert Gunther Inc in an alley off of Biddle Street in downtown Baltimore, he used a technique known as metal sandwich construction. The first skis he made consisted of two light layers of aluminum bonded to sidewalls of thin plywood, with a center filling of honeycomb plastic. Although these skis were very light, they all broke quite quickly during trials. Head did not give up on his idea, and was encouraged by several professional skiers, including 1939 World Champion Emile Allais and ski instructors Clif Taylor and Neil Robinson, who assured Head that he would love to use his skis if they did not break. Throughout that winter Head would make a ski pair and send it out to Robinson, who returned it to Head after it broke. Head figured out the flaws of his design, came up with modifications, sent the new ski pair to Robinson, and the process repeated. By the end of the winter of 1947, Head came up with skis that were as strong as wooden skis but were half the weight. In order to make his skis more efficient, Head made several other changes, like substituting plywood for honeycomb plastic, covering the bottom of the ski with polyethylene to avoid the problem of icy bottoms and adopting continuous steel edges to harden the edges of the ski. The new improved skis were almost as heavy as the conventional wooden skis, but were stronger and easier to control. Head skis helped to popularize alpine skiing in the U.S.; the innovative equipment made turning significantly easier. In 1950, Head founded the Head Ski Company, which became very successful. Within a couple of years it was the major supplier of alpine skis in the U.S. and influenced ski design worldwide. The company later diversified into tennis and other racquet sports; its most notable product was the innovative Arthur Ashe racquet, constructed of aluminum honeycomb. Howard Head sold the company to AMF in 1969 and retired. After a number of takeovers and acquisitions, HEAD, N.V. is currently based in Kennelbach, Austria (operational) and Amsterdam, Netherlands (corporate offices).  Tennis racquet  After retiring, Head decided to take tennis lessons and for this purpose he got himself a tennis ball machine, which was manufactured by Prince Manufacturing Inc. Although Howard was not very good at tennis, he figured out that the equipment for the game needed a lot of improvement or he was going to need a lot more practice. To begin with he became the majority shareholder and chairman of the board of Prince. While Head considerably improved the design of the ball machine, he still did not get any better at the game. He figured it out that it was because of the small sweet-spot of the tennis racquet. In order to make the game of tennis easier, Head came up with the design of oversized racquet. He filed and obtained a patent that covered tennis racquets with size 95‚Äì135 square inches. He also pioneered the development of the graphite racquet, which eventually became the industry standard, replacing wooden racquets. Although Prince was the first company to patent oversize racquets, the Bentley Fortissimo preceded the patent by two years, causing Germany to invalidate it. Weed also introduced an oversize racquet in 1975, before the first Prince oversize, the aluminum Prince Classic, was introduced.

As a boy, his passions were singing and athletics (football, baseball, swimming and tennis). After high school graduation, he moved to New York to pursue a musical career and was hired as a chorus member in Irving Berlin‚Äôs Music Box Revue. He occasionally sang the primary tenor role when headliner John Steele was unable to appear and then was given a major role with the Music Box Review Road Company. During the mid-1920s, he furthered his career in Europe, studying voice and giving concerts in France, Germany and Italy. While living in Paris, Bullock became fascinated with the work of the Impressionists and post-Impressionists.

He bought his first camera and began taking pictures. =Return to the United States= During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, Bullock stopped his European travels and settled in West Virginia to manage his first wife's family business interests. He stopped singing professionally, completed some pre-law courses at the state university, and continued to take photographs as a hobby. In 1938, he moved his family back to Los Angeles and enrolled in law school at the University of Southern California where his mother Georgia Bullock (California's first woman jurist)National Association of Women Lawyers website had studied law. Completely dissatisfied after a few weeks, he left USC and became a student of photography at the nearby Art Center School. From 1938 to 1940, Bullock became deeply involved in exploring alternative processes such as solarization and bas relief. After graduation from Art Center, his experimental work was exhibited in one of L.A. County Museum's early solo photographic exhibitions.Complete list of Bullock exhibitions 1940-2010 on official website During the early 40s, he worked as a commercial photographer and then enlisted in the Army. Released from the military to photograph for the aircraft industry, he was first employed at Lockheed and then headed the photographic department of Connors-Joyce until the end of the war. Remarried, and with a new daughter, Bullock traveled throughout California from 1945 to 1946, producing and selling postcard pictures while co-owning a commercial photographic business in Santa Maria. He also worked on developing a way to control the line effect of solarization for which he later was awarded two patents. In 1946, he settled with his family in Monterey, where he had obtained the photographic concession at the Fort Ord military base. He left the concession in 1959, but continued commercial free-lance work until 1968. =Bullock and Weston= A major turning point in Bullock's life as a creative photographer occurred in 1948, when he met Edward Weston. Inspired by the power and beauty of Weston's prints, he began to explore \\"straight photography\\" for himself. Throughout the decade of the 1950s, he devoted himself to developing his own vision, establishing deep, direct connections with nature. A lifelong learner, he also read widely in the areas of physics, general semantics, philosophy, psychology, eastern religion and art. Studying the work of such people as Albert Einstein, Korzybski, Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, LaoTzu and Klee, he kept evolving his own dynamic system of principles and concepts that both reflected and nurtured his creative journey.Published and unpublished writings of Wynn Bullock, compiled by his daughter Barbara Bullock-Wilson =The Family of Man= In the mid-1950s, Bullock's artistry came into the public spotlight when Edward Steichen chose two of his photographs to include in the 1955 The Family of Man exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. MOMA Archive page for the Family of Man exhibit At the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC, his photograph \\"Let There Be Light,\\" was voted the most popular of the show. The second, \\"Child in Forest,\\" became one of the exhibition's most memorable images. By the end of that decade, his work was being featured in many exhibitions and publications worldwide. =Color Light Abstractions= During the early 60s, Bullock departed from black-and-white imagery and produced a major body of work that he referred to as \\"Color Light Abstractions\\".Monograph: Color Light Abstractions; pub. 2010; For him, these photographs represented an in-depth exploration of light, manifesting his belief that light is a great force at the heart of all being, \\"perhaps,\\" as he said, \\"the most profound truth in the universe.\\" Although he was tremendously excited about this work, it proved to be ahead of its time in terms of available resources to reproduce it, and it remained largely unknown for almost 50 years. In 2008, the family estate started making high-resolution scans of his original 35 mm Kodachrome slides, producing archivally stable prints, and exhibiting and publishing the imagery.Britt Salvesen video on Wynn Bullock Color Light Abstractions, at official website =Philosophical explorations late in life= In the mid-1960s, frustrated by the limitations of color printing technology, Bullock returned to making black-and-white photographs, continuing to expand his vision to create innovative images that reflected his philosophical nature. Differentiating what he termed \\"reality\\", the visible and the known, from \\"existence\\", the underlying truth of things, he was ceaseless in his attempts to expand his own faculties of perception and understanding so he could come ever closer in his experiences to the essence of things. Finding the means to more fully evoke that essence was also a key part of his quest.Wynn Bullock: The Enchanted Landscape; pub. 1999; Although he included several different alternative processes (extremely long time exposures, multiple images, up-side-down and negative printing) in his repertoire of techniques, each was always used in the service of symbolizing new ways of relating to and knowing the world. He wrote, :\\"Searching is everything ‚Äì going beyond what you know. And the test of the search is really in the things themselves, the things you seek to understand. What is important is not what you think about them, but how they enlarge you.\\" In the early 70s, Bullock started on a new leg of his creative journey, one that he found completely absorbing and deeply satisfying but which was cut short by incurable cancer. Many of his photographs from that period reveal light emanating from within the heart of things, life glowing and pulsing with energy and vitality. Other photographs are of natural forms that depict or suggest universal human qualities, humanity \\"deeply embedded in\\" and re-united with nature. Throughout his career, Bullock was an active lecturer, workshop leader and teacher, giving of himself to fellow seekers. As a master photographer, Bullock was one of five artists whose archives established the University of Arizona‚Äôs Center for Creative Photography.History of the Center For Creative Photography on the University of Arizona Website His work may also be found in the permanent collections of over 90 major institutions throughout the world as well as in numerous publications. Background =Family= Bullock married Mary Elizabeth McCarty in 1925; the marriage ended in divorce, in 1941. They had two children: Mary Wynne (Mimi) (1930 ) and George (1935‚Äì1942). He married Edna Jeanette Earle in 1943 and they had two daughters: Barbara Ann (1945 ) and Lynne Marie (1953 ). Mimi, Edna, Barbara and Lynne each appear in images made during the 1950s. A year after Bullock died in 1975, Edna took up photography and enjoyed a twenty-year career as an artist before she died in 1997. Barbara formed collaborative relationships with both her parents during their lifetimes and has written extensivelyComplete Wynn Bullock Bibliographies, on official website on their work. =Education= Bullock took courses at Columbia University, 1925, and University of West Virginia, mid-1930s; attended and graduated from Art Center School in Los Angeles, 1938-1940. He was a lifelong student of philosophy, physics, general semantics, psychology, theology, spirituality and art. =Influences= Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings stimulated Bullock‚Äôs initial interest in the visual arts. The photographs of Man Ray and L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy influenced his early experimental work as did Art Center School professor, Edward Kaminski. Although Bullock enjoyed close associations with Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Ansel Adams, Ruth Bernhard and other prominent west coast photographers, he said, :\\"Theoretical scientists who probe the secrets of the universe and philosophers who seek answers to existence, as well as painters such as Paul Klee who find the thoughts of men of science compatible with art, influence me far more than most photographers.\\" =Noteworthy accomplishments= Bullock obtained patents in the U.S., Canada, and Great Britain for a \\"Photographic Process for Producing Line Image\\" in the late 1940s. He was granted a second U.S. patent on the \\"Methods and Means for Matching Opposing Densities in Photographic Film\\" in the early 1950s. In 1957, he was honored with a medal from the Salon of International Photography and, throughout the 1960s, he received several awards from various professional photographic organizations. In 1968, Bullock became a trustee and chairman of the exhibition committee during the formative years of Friends of Photography in Carmel, California.Center for Photographic Art, Carmel Along with Ansel Adams, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind and Frederick Sommer, he became part of the founding group of photographers whose archives established the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in 1975. Bullock taught advanced photography courses at the Institute of Design in Chicago during Aaron Siskind's sabbatical and at San Francisco State College at the invitation of John Gutmann. He was a guest instructor for the Ansel Adams Yosemite Workshops. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, he lectured widely, led photographic workshops, and participated in many seminars and symposia on various topics and issues in photography. Quotes by Bullock *I didn't want to tell the tree or weed what it was. I wanted it to tell me something and through me express its meaning in nature. *Light to me is perhaps the most profound truth in the universe. My thinking has been deeply affected by the belief everything is some form of radiant energy. *I love the medium of photography, for with its unique realism it gives me the power to go beyond conventional ways of seeing and understanding and say, \\"This is real, too.\\" *I feel all things as dynamic events, being, changing, and interacting with each other in space and time even as I photograph them. *As sounds in a musical composition can be used not to express physical objects but ideas, emotions, harmonies, rhythmic orders and most any expression of the human mind and spirit, so light can be used visually to express the mind and spirit. *Light used in its own right, as in light pictures, gives to photography the wonderful plasticity that paint gives to painting without loss of the unmatched reality of straight photography. *What you see is real - but only on the particular level to which you've developed your sense of seeing. You can expand your reality by developing new ways of perceiving. *Mysteries lie all around us, even in the most familiar things, waiting only to be perceived.

The daily market with the statue of Giordano Bruno in the background. A close- up of the statue of Giordano Bruno. Campo de' Fiori in the 1740s, etching by Giuseppe Vasi. Campo de' Fiori (, literally \\"field of flowers\\") is a rectangular square south of Piazza Navona in Rome, Italy, at the border between rione Parione and rione Regola. It is diagonally southeast of the Palazzo della Cancelleria and one block northeast of the Palazzo Farnese. Campo de' Fiori, translated literally from Italian, means \\"field of flowers\\". The name dates to the Middle Ages when the area was a meadow. History In Ancient Rome, the area was unused space between Pompey's Theatre and the flood-prone Tiber. Though the Orsini established themselves on the south flank of the space in the 13th century, until the 15th century, the square remained undeveloped. The first church in the immediate vicinity was built during the pontificate of Boniface IX (1389-1404), Santa Brigida a Campo de' Fiori; with the building-up of the rione, the church has now come to face that part of the former square that is now Piazza Farnese. In 1456, under Pope Callixtus III, Ludovico Cardinal Trevisani paved the area as part of a large project to improve rione Parione. This renewal was both the result and cause of several important buildings being built in the surroundings; in particular, the Orsini palace on Campo de' Fiori was rebuilt. The Renaissance Palazzo della Cancelleria can be seen in Vasi's etching, rising majestically beyond the far right corner of the square. Campo de' Fiori has never been architecturally formalized. The square has always remained a focus for commercial and street culture: the surrounding streets are named for trades--Via dei Balestrari (crossbow-makers), Via dei Baullari (coffer-makers), Via dei Cappellari (hat- makers), Via dei Chiavari (key-makers) and Via dei Giubbonari (tailors). With new access streets installed by Sixtus IV-- Via Florea and Via Pellegrino-- the square became a part of the Via papale (\\"Pope's road\\"), the street linking Basilica of St. John Lateran and the Vatican and traversed by the Pope after his election during the so-called \\"Cavalcata del possesso\\", when he reached the Lateran from the Vatican to take possession of the city. This urban development brought wealth to the area: A flourishing horse market took place twice a week (Monday and Saturday) and many inns, hotels and shops came to be situated in Campo de' Fiori. The most famous of them, the Taverna della Vacca (\\"cow's Inn\\") still stands at the southwest corner of the square, at the begin of Via de' Cappellari. It belonged to Vannozza dei Cattanei, the most famous lover of Alexander VI Borgia, whose family seal is still on display on the house facade. Executions used to be held publicly in Campo de' Fiori. Here, on 17 February 1600, the philosopher Giordano Bruno was burnt alive for heresy, and all of his works were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by the Holy Office. In 1889, Ettore Ferrari dedicated a monument to him on the exact spot of his death: He stands defiantly facing the Vatican and was regarded in the first days of a reunited Italy as a martyr to freedom of thought. The inscription on the base reads: A BRUNO - IL SECOLO DA LUI DIVINATO - QUI DOVE IL ROGO ARSE (\\"To Bruno - the century predicted by him - here where the fire burned\\"). The body of theologian and scientist Marco Antonio de Dominis was also burned in this square in 1624. In addition to people, the Holy Office burned the Talmud in Campo de' Fiori; the book burning took place on September 9, 1553, the first day of the Jewish new year holiday, Rosh Hashanah. A plaque commemorating this incident was affixed to the marketplace street in Campo de' Fiori in 2011 (the idea of memorializing this event was inspired by the monument to Giordano Bruno). The plaque quotes a Talmudic description of the martyrdom of Rabbi Hananiah ben Teradion, who was burned alive wrapped in a Torah scroll; it also quotes \\"Sha'ali Serufah ba-Esh\\", a lamentation poem by Meir of Rothenburg written after seeing wagon-loads of Talmudic manuscripts burned in Paris in 1242. The demolition of a block of housing in 1858 enlarged Campo de' Fiori, and since 1869, a daily vegetable and fish market that was previously held in Piazza Navona has been held there. The ancient cattle fountain known as la Terrina (the \\"soupbowl\\") was resited in 1889 and replaced with a copy that now is used to keep cut flowers fresh. Its inscription: FA DEL BEN E LASSA DIRE (\\"Do good and let them talk\\") suits the gossipy nature of the marketplace. In the afternoons, local games of football give way to set- ups for outdoor caf√©s. At night, Campo de' Fiori is a meeting place for tourists and young people coming from the whole city. In the years after 2000, it became one of the most dangerous nighttime places of the city due to assaults and affrays by drunk tourists and soccer supporters.

Life and works Born in Vienna in 1897, to Czech Jewish parents, Perl√®s struggled as a writer in Paris during his early 30s, where he worked for a while for the Paris office of the Chicago Tribune. In 1933, American writer Henry Miller - not yet known - took an apartment with Perl√®s in Clichy. Miller wrote of this experience in his book Quiet Days in Clichy (1956, orig. written 1940), in which the character \\"Carl\\" is based on Perl√®s. Other Miller works about Perl√®s in Paris include his early What Are You Going To Do About Alf?, and a letter to Perl√®s in Aller Retour New York. By 1936, Perl√®s was part of a vibrant Parisian literary scene that included Miller, Lawrence Durrell, and Ana√Øs Nin, as well as Antonin Artaud, Michael Fraenkel, Hans Reichel and others. Ana√Øs Nin writes that she first met Alfred Perl√®s in April, 1932.Diaries, Volume I, 1931 - 1934, 1966, p. 62. Miller and Durrell often referred to Perl√®s as \\"Joe\\" or \\"Joey\\". Some of these writers were featured in a magazine called The Booster, which Perl√®s co-published in 1936, along with Miller, Durrell, and Nin. In 1939, with the start of World War II the group broke apart, as Miller moved on to Greece and Perl√®s fled to England (where he applied for, and was granted, British citizenship). A few years later, Perl√®s wrote a piece about this pre-War circle in Henry Miller at Villa Seurat (featured in The Happy Rock anthology, 1945, and republished by the Village Press as a chapbook in 1973). Perl√®s and Miller maintained a lifelong friendship. Miller visited Perl√®s in the UK and Perl√®s visited Miller in Big Sur, California, where he wrote My Friend Henry Miller (written in 1954/55). Miller wrote a tribute to Perl√®s in the memoir Joey. Later in life, he lived with his Scottish wife Ann, in a borrowed house in Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus but they were forced to leave at the time of the Turkish invasion in 1974 moving to England, where they lived in a modest house on a redbrick housing estate in the town of Wells from where they made regular visits to the Cotswolds to meet the poet and writer P.J.

The Egtved Girl (c. 1390-1370 BC) was a Nordic Bronze Age girl whose well- preserved remains were discovered outside Egtved, Denmark in 1921. Aged 16-18 at death, she was slim, tall, had short, blond hair and well-trimmed nails.Hair fashion of the Bronze age National Museum of Denmark. Retrieved 17.11.2011. Her burial has been dated by dendrochronology to 1370 BC. She was discovered together with cremated remains of a child in a barrow approximately wide and high. Only the girl's hair, brain, teeth, nails and a little of her skin remain preserved. Burial The barrow was excavated in 1921, and a coffin was found in an east-west alignment. It was sealed and transported to the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, where it was opened, revealing the Egtved Girl. In the coffin, the girl was wrapped in an ox hide. She wore a loose bodice with sleeves reaching the elbow. She had a bare waist and wore a short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets, and a woollen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. At her feet were the cremated remains of a child aged 5 to 6. By her head there was a small birch bark box that contained an awl, bronze pins, and a hair net. Before the coffin was closed she was covered with a blanket and an ox hide. Flowering yarrow (indicating a summer burial) and a bucket of beer made of wheat, honey, bog-myrtle and cowberries were placed atop. Her distinctive outfit, which caused a sensation when it was unearthed in the 1920s, is the best preserved example of a style now known to be common in northern Europe during the Bronze Age. The good preservation of the Egtved Girl is due to the acidic bog conditions of the soil, which is a common condition of this locale.  Reconstruction  The outfit was reconstructed for the National Museum of Denmark by the Lejre Experimental Centre and is on display there. A reconstructed set of clothes, as well as details of the excavation, are on display in the Egtved Girl's museum at the excavation site.  Origin and life  Initial work by Frei et al in 2015, since contradicted, examined chemical isotopes of strontium from the Egtved Girl's teeth, fingernails, hair & clothing, and based on these, proposed that she had likely come from the Black Forest region of Germany, but married and moved to Denmark, subsequently traveling back and forth between the two areas. However, Thomsen and Andreasen demonstrated in 2019 that the strontium isotopic data obtained from the area surrounding the grave and used by Frei et al for comparison against the remains had been contaminated by additional strontium contained in the agricultural lime used in modern farming in the Egtved area. When Thomsen and Andreasen analyzed samples locally from places uncontaminated by modern farming, they found that the range of strontium isotopic values in the surrounding natural environment matched those in the girl. Thus, it is most plausible that she originated from and spent her entire life in the Egtved area, and did not come far abroad, as proposed by Frei et al. Thomsen and Andreasen's results show that the girl did live about half the year in one area ‚Äì likely the river valley in Egtved ‚Äì and the other half of the year in another place ‚Äì likely the local plateau, perhaps in the practice of transhumance farming and seasonal pastoral movement within a small area. In a 2019 article based on strontium isotope analysis, Sophie Bergerbrant suggests an origin of Sweden or Norway for the Egtved Girl. Gallery Image:Egtved Girl.gifReplica of the Egtved Girl's outfit.

He was provisional governor of the Dakota Territory, and both the cities of Wilmot and Brookings as well as the county of Brookings, South Dakota are named for him.http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/bronstein-brookover.htmlWilmot Brookings Early life Brookings was born on October 23, 1830, in Woolwich, Maine to Abner and Susannah Bayley Brookings. (The 1860 Dakota Territory census lists his birthplace, possibly incorrectly, as North Carolina). Brookings attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, graduating in 1855. He married Clara Carney of Dresden, Maine and went on to teach at Litchfield, North Anson, and Wiscasset before being admitted to the bar in May 1857. Dakota Territory Brookings moved to Sioux Falls, Minnesota Territory on August 27, 1857, where he helped pioneers organize a county government (Minnehaha County). The county appointed him district attorney. In February 1858, Brookings rode a horse from Sioux Falls to the Yankton area during a blizzard. His horse slipped and fell into Split Rock Creek in the freezing weather. Brookings made it safely to Yankton, but his wet legs had suffered such severe frostbite they both needed to be amputated. He spent the rest of his life using a pair of squeaky, wooden legs that caused him discomfort and sometimes made walking difficult. =Provisional governor= When Minnesota was admitted to the union in 1858, Sioux Falls became part of the newly forming Dakota Territory. Though Dakota Territory did not officially form until 1861, an interim provisional government formed in January 1859 and elected Brookings to the upper house of the interim territorial legislature. That legislative body later appointed Brookings Governor of Dakota Territory. However, the federal government refused to acknowledge either the provisional government or its territorial governor (his term lasted until March 2, 1861) as official. When the region finally did became an organized territory in 1861, Brookings was elected to the Territory Council for two years and later served three straight terms as a representative from Yankton County. In 1864 he served as territory speaker of the house and was appointed superintendent of the U.S. Military Wagon Road from Minnesota to Montana in 1865. =Later political career= After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, territory Republicans opposing Lincoln's Democratic successor Andrew Johnson nominated Brookings as their congressional delegate, on an anti-Johnson platform. Brookings lost to fellow Republican Walter A. Burleigh. Brookings served on the Territorial Council from 1867 to 1869, including a stint as council president in 1868. He also served as district attorney for Yankton County from 1867-68. In 1869 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Dakota Territory. Brookings served in this capacity through 1873. Between 1883 and 1885 he worked as a member of South Dakota's constitutional convention. On July 3, 1871 Brookings County was formally organized and named after him. The city of Brookings, South Dakota was also named for him, though he only ever visited the town twice. In 1871 Brookings helped organize the Dakota Southern Railroad, and spent the next ten years serving as an executive for the railroads that would eventually become part of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Brookings was among the first to ride a locomotive into Dakota Territory when the first Dakota Southern train entered the region on October 1, 1872. =Later life and death= In January 1885, Brookings bought and became editor of the Sioux Falls Leader newspaper (which later merged with the Sioux Falls Argus and became known as the Argus Leader).http://archive.argusleader.com/article/99999999/CUSTOMER06/60517008/Argus- Leader-History Brookings also served as president of the Minnehaha Trust Company, Director of the Sioux Falls National Bank, National Realty Company, and Safe Deposit Company. Brookings died riding a streetcar in Boston, Massachusetts on June 13, 1905 while on a return trip from visiting his hometown in Woolwich, Maine. He is buried in Yankton, South Dakota.

Abdi-Heba's name can be translated as \\"servant of Hebat\\", a Hurrian goddess. Whether Abdi-Heba was himself of Hurrian descent is unknown, as is the relationship between the general populace of pre-Israelite Jerusalem (called, several centuries later, Jebusites in the Bible) and the Hurrians. Egyptian documents have him deny he was a mayor (·∏´azƒÅnu) and assert he is a soldier (we'w), the implication being he was the son of a local chief sent to Egypt to receive military training there.Donald B. Redford, Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times, Princeton University Press, 1992 p.270. EA 161, letter by Aziru, leader of Amurru, (stating his case to pharaoh), (note paragraph divisions). Also unknown is whether he was part of a dynasty that governed Jerusalem or whether he was put on the throne by the Egyptians. Abdi-Heba himself notes that he holds his position not through his parental lineage but by the grace of Pharaoh, but this might be flattery rather than an accurate representation of the situation. At this time the area he administered from his garrison may have had a population of fifteen hundred people and Jerusalem would have been a 'small highlands stronghold' in the fourteenth century BC with no fortifications or large buildings.Finkelstein, Israel and Silberman, Neil AsherThe Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, 2001, The Free Press, New York City, p. 239 Correspondence with Egypt During Abdi-Heba's reign the region was under attack from marauding bands of Habiru.EA 179. Scholars refer to the Amarna letters by a number system prefixed with \\"EA\\" for \\"El Amarna\\". Abdi-Heba made frequent pleas to the Pharaoh of Egypt (probably Amenhotep III), for an armyEA 179-183. or, at least, an officer to command.EA 182 Abdi-Heba also made other requests for military aid in fighting off his enemies, both Canaanite warlords and bands of Apiru: As a result, conspiracy charges are made against Abdi Heba, who defended himself strenuously in his correspondence with Pharaoh.EA 179. In later years Abdi-Heba appears to have reconciled with the Apiru, or at least certain bands of them, and hired mercenaries from among their ranks. Indeed, though he earlier complained about the depredations of Labaya, Shuwardata, king of the Canaanite town of Keilah as well as other places in the Judean highlands, refers to him as a \\"new Labaya\\": Abdi-Heba's ultimate fate is unknown.

Professional wrestling career =Da Hit Squad= Lopez attended Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) shows as a fan and enrolled in the JAPW training school when it opened in the late 1990s. After training for several months, Lopez began attending Homicide's training school, The Doghouse, in New York City. When his training was completed in 1999, Lopez adopted the name \\"Mafia\\" and formed a tag team with another Doghouse graduate who he resembled, Monsta Mack. Mafia and Mack, collectively known as Da Hit Squad, began wrestling on the northeastern independent circuit. They won the JAPW Tag Team Championship in 1999 and in Jersey Championship Wrestling's Tag Team Championship in 2000. In 2001, the duo won titles in World Xtreme Wrestling and USA Pro Wrestling. At one stage they held a total of six titles between them. After Mack injured his leg, he was unable to defend his half of the JAPW Tag Team Championship in a scheduled match on January 25, 2003 against the Dirty Rotten Scoundrelz. Lopez unsuccessfully defended the title in a handicap match. =Jersey All Pro Wrestling (1999‚Äì2005)= Lopez won the JAPW Heavyweight Championship on February 22, 2003 in Woodbridge, New Jersey, defeating his trainer, Homicide. Inspired by his victory, Lopez left the partnership with Mack, who he defeated in a match for USA Pro Wrestling on March 8. Following a successful title defense against Slyk Wagner Brown, Lopez announced he was renaming himself \\"Dan Maff\\" and formed a stable with the Dirty Rotten Scoundrelz known as \\"La Familia\\". Lopez's title reign came to an end on August 1, 2003, when he was defeated by Al Snow, a WWE employee brought into JAPW as an outside challenger. He won the title for a second time on December 13, 2003, defeating Jerry Lawler in Secaucus, New Jersey. On February 28, 2004, Lopez defended the JAPW Heavyweight Championship against his former partner, Monsta Mack. Lopez retained the title and embraced Mack after the match in a show of respect and camaraderie. The Dirty Rotten Scoundrelz were disgusted by the show of sportsmanship and attacked Lopez as he tried to leave the ring. Mack returned to the ring, but, instead of helping his former partner, assisted the Soundrelz with their assault on Lopez. Mack then formed a new version of La Familia with the Soundrelz and enlisted a number of heels to try to take the title away from Lopez. Lopez fought off a number of challengers, including ECW alumnus Mike Awesome. He also engaged in a lengthy feud for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship with the number one contender, Jay Lethal. =Ring of Honor (2002‚Äì2005)= Lopez (as \\"Mafia\\") and Mack appeared on The Era of Honor Begins, the inaugural Ring of Honor (ROH) event, on February 23, 2002, attacking the Christopher Street Connection (CSC). They feuded with the CSC for several weeks before beginning a series of hardcore matches with The Carnage Crew, H.C. Loc and DeVito. In 2003, Da Hit Squad formed a loose alliance with Homicide. Lopez betrayed Mack on April 12, 2003, at Epic Encounter. Later that evening, Lopez went to the ring immediately after a match between Homicide and Christopher Daniels and indicated that he had joined forces with Daniels and his stable, \\"The Prophecy\\". Lopez was renamed \\"Dan Maff\\" and designated \\"the assassin of The Prophecy\\". Lopez's singles career in ROH began on May 31 at Do Or Die, where he defeated B.J. Whitmer with the assistance of Allison Danger, the valet of The Prophecy. Following his victory, Lopez was confronted by two of Homicide's former students, Julius Smokes and Low Ki, who accused him of \\"forgetting his roots\\". On June 14 at Night of the Grudges, The Prophecy (Lopez, Daniels and Donovan Morgan) defeated rival faction The Group, with Lopez pinning ROH World Champion Samoa Joe. This led to a title match at WrestleRave '03 on June 28, where Joe defeated Lopez to retain. Lopez and the rest of The Prophecy continued to feud with Homicide and his supporters, leading to a match between Lopez and Low-Ki at Bitter Friends, Stiffer Enemies on August 16. The match was halted when Lopez was legitimately knocked unconscious following a poorly timed, stiff kick from Low-Ki. In late 2003, Lopez competed in the annual Field of Honor event, but was eliminated by B.J. Whitmer. Whitmer joined The Prophecy on December 22 at Final Battle 2003, and confessed that he had been behind a career-ending attack on Lucy, the valet of CM Punk, earlier that year. This infuriated Lopez, who had been disgusted by the brutal attack and had sworn on his father's grave to Punk that The Prophecy had nothing to do with the attack. Lopez called Whitmer a \\"scumbag\\" but was admonished by Daniels, who claimed that the attack was part of his plan to destroy ROH. Lopez and Whitmer began teaming together in 2004 after Daniels left ROH, and, along with Allison Danger, continued their feud with CM Punk and the Second City Saints. They defeated the Saints in a match for the ROH Tag Team Championships on May 15, 2004 in Lexington, MA at Round Robin Challenge III, but lost the title to the Briscoe Brothers that same evening. On June 12, 2004, at World Title Classic, Lopez and Whitmer defeated three other teams in a 35-minute-long Ultimate Endurance Match. After the match, Lopez convinced Whitmer to discard both the Prophecy name and the managerial services of Allison Danger, claiming that they no longer needed a leader or a manager and could now win matches on their own merits. Danger was furious and placed a bounty on the heads of Lopez and Whitmer. They spent several months feuding with teams sent after them by Danger, including Slash Venom and Chicano and The Carnage Crew. On December 26 at Final Battle 2004 they defeated the Carnage Crew in a \\"Fight Without Honor\\" and shook hands with their opponents after the match. Whitmer and Lopez captured the ROH Tag Team Championship for a second time at the third ROH anniversary show on February 19, 2005 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, defeating the Havana Pitbulls. =Retirement= In March 2005, Homicide issued a number of statements accusing Lopez of \\"betraying\\" him and announcing that he would not work for any company which hired Lopez in the future. As a result, Lopez retired from professional wrestling. The titles, which he held at the time, were vacated although he kept both of the physical belts themselves. JAPW openly acknowledged the situation between Lopez and Homicide. =Return to the independent circuit (2005‚Äìpresent)= Lopez broke his retirement on October 8, 2005, unsuccessfully challenging El Chicano for the IWA Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship in Levittown. In February 2009, Lopez arrived at American Championship Entertainment (ACE) in Union City, New Jersey after multiple cryptic videos and comments on the ACE message board, in the ring, face to face, Lopez was challenging the current champion for the belt during the next show \\"Destined For Greatness\\". On March 21, 2009, Lopez defeated Hollywood Joe Hardway for the Heavyweight Championship. Lopez was a surprise guest at Jersey All Pro Wrestling's June 28 event in Jersey City, New Jersey. Maff made his return after the World Heavyweight Title bout between Heavyweight Champion Kenny Omega and New Jersey State Champion, The Grim Reefer. Lopez and Homicide did appear at the same show at the Elks Lodge in Queens on July 12, 2010. On June 27, 2009, Lopez defeated Jay Lethal to win the JAPW Heavyweight Title for the third time. Lopez also worked for other independent promotions. On March 19, 2010, Lopez defeated Rob Fury, El Shoes and Xavier at the ICW return show \\"Reborn\\" at the Elks Lodge in Queens, New York. he also wrestled for Pro Wrestling Syndicate (PWS). On May 13, 2011, New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), with help from JAPW, held their first ever shows in the United States as part of the Invasion Tour 2011. During the event, held in Rahway, New Jersey, Maff made his debut for the Japanese promotion, losing to Toru Yano via low blow in the first round of a tournament to determine the first IWGP Intercontinental Champion. At the following day's event in New York City, Maff teamed with Jushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated CHAOS (Shinsuke Nakamura, Gedo and Jado). On the final day of the tour in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Maff teamed with Satoshi Kojima in a match, where they were defeated by the IWGP Tag Team Champions, Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson). On August 19, 2011, Maff became Impact Championship Wrestling's Heavyweight Champion after winning one-day tournament. He defeated Azrieal in the first round, Devon Moore in semifinal and Danny Demanto in final. On August 15, 2014, Maff made a surprise appearance for House of Glory Wrestling in Queens, New York. He was a last minute replacement for Jay Lethal and took the loss against Anthony Gangone. In June 2015, Maff became Pro Wrestling Syndicate Champion by defeating Mario Bokara and Fallah Bahh in a Tri Force Match. Since 2016, Maff has been a mainstay at Pat Buck's WrestlePro. On November 18, 2016, Maff became WrestlePro's first Silver Champion. =Return to Ring of Honor (2019‚Äìpresent)= In November 2019, Maff made his return to Ring of Honor, facing PCO in a match.

On 1 January 1984, the municipalities Numansdorp and Klaaswaal were merged into one municipality called Cromstrijen. Cromstrijen was merged into the new municipality Hoeksche Waard in January 2019.Wet samenvoeging gemeenten Binnenmaas, Cromstrijen, Korendijk, Oud-Beijerland en Strijen, 11 July 2018, accessed at overheid.nl  History  Numansdorp was founded in 1642. The village was built in the Numanspolder. It took a while till the embankment of this polder was started. The reason for the delay was a disagreement between the Lords of Cromstrijen and the owners of Zuid- Beijerland. When the founding of the village had finally taken place, it still didn't have an official name, even though the locals called it Buitensluis. In a meeting it was decided to call the village Village of Cromstrijen (Dorp van Cromstrijen). But Dijkgraaf Vos, the chairman of the meeting, believed the village should me named after the first Ambachtsheer, Gerard Numan. The first buildings of the village were built around the drainage sluice at the Numanspolderdijk (now called Molendijk) and from there the town spread along the Binnenhaven. The main street, Voorstraat, was expanded with several crossing streets. In 1647, at the end of one of those crossing streets called the Kerkstraat, a church was built. right At the change of 19th century, more buildings were built along the East side of the Voorstraat and several streets crossing it. The drainage sluice was till 1662 made of wood, its successor was made of stone. In 1912 the sluice was replaced by a diesel-run pumping station and in 1942 by one that ran on electricity. There is a sluice door in the sea dike of the Torensteepolder. It originated from before 1970, when the Haringvliet and Volkerak were still open and there were still tides in the Hollands Diep. The Molendijk had a sluice to the Binnenhaven called Buitensluis. From there the water runs to Klaaswaal. The Middelsluissedijk 1625 had one to the polder Groot-Cromstrijen, also known as Middelsluis (also a village), and the Boomdijk had one for the polder Klein-Cromstrijen called the Oude sluis. = Fort Buitensluis = In 1793 an earthen fort was built next to the harbour of Numansdorp. The purpose of this fort was to keep an eye on the shipping between the Volkerak and Hollands Diep. In the same year, France attacked the Austrian Netherlands. Thanks to the Battle of Neerwinden the Austrian Netherlands remain in Austrian hands. In 1795 the Batavian Republic starts. In 1862, the second cabinet of Thorbecke, ordered to reinforce the fort. From 1874 on, the fort became a part of the Defence line of the Hollands Diep and the Volkerak. In 1915 the fort was reinforced for a second time, this time with reinforced concrete. = Second World War = At 12 May 1940 the soldiers of the fort receive the command to go to Westmaas where they have to secure the Barendrechtse brug (Bridge of Barendrecht). At May 13 of the same year the soldiers leave the artillery and move on to Brielle and next to The Hague. Frits Philips flees from Eindhoven at 14 May 1940 and was bombed near Numansdorp. Unharmed he managed to reach The Hague. In September 1944 the Germans moved the people of Numansdorp, because they wanted to flood the area as a defence against the Allies. In May 1945 they were allowed back in the village. = North Sea flood of 1953 = In the night of 31 January and morning of 1 February 1953 large parts of Zeeland, the islands of South Holland and some parts of North Brabant were flooded, due to a combination of high tide and a strong northwestern storm which caused many dikes to break. A result of the flood was the death of 56 inhabitants of the area, which made the Numansdorp the village with the highest number on the Hoeksche Waard. The majority of them, 54, lived in the agricultural area Ambachtsheerlijkheid Cromstrijen not far from the village. The last 3 bodies were found in June that year. Apart from the loss of human lives, about 500 horses, cows, pigs and many poultry were lost. 136 farms and homes were completely ruined, about 850 homes had water damage and more than 2,800 persons were evacuated. Because the fields had been flooded with salt water for 14 days, they couldn't be properly used for the rest of the year.

The resort is also in close proximity to the cities of Lynchburg, Waynesboro, and Charlottesville, and within a three-hour drive of Washington, D.C. It opened in 1975 and is currently owned by EPR Properties and managed by Pacific Group Resorts, Inc. Unlike other ski resorts, Wintergreen is a \\"Mountain Top\\" resort in which all of the amenities are built on the peaks and ridges, rather than at the traditional base.  History  Top of the Highlands in January 2006, Wintergreen Resort = Development = In 1969, a tract of land known as The Big Survey, located in the heart of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains and home to a wide variety of forestry, timberland, and wildlife, was purchased by a group of investors. Within a few years, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes of Boston purchased The Big Survey, and the planning of Wintergreen began. The Sea Pines Company soon joined the group to plan and market the area and a new community. By 1975, the grounds sported a large ski area, consisting of eight slopes and three chairlifts, which opened with much fanfare and Virginia Governor Mills E. Godwin in attendance. The resort's first restaurant, The Copper Mine, was open to the public only during the winter months. The original welcoming center, the Wintergreen Country Store, was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. In later years, additional ski runs were added in cleared areas to the west and east of the original development and village. = Growth = The following year, however, Melba Investors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bankers Trust Co. of New York acquired Wintergreen from Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, and Lewis F. Payne, Jr. founded Wintergreen Development, Inc. to operate the resort and serve as the developer and managing agent. Within a year, the resort could beckon summer vacationers and residents with the completion of the new Ellis Maples-designed Devils Knob golf course (June 1977) and the opening of the mountain tennis center (June 1978). In January 1978, Wintergreen hosted its first Winter Special Olympics. There was also an ongoing plant transplantation project, which began to save native plant species, and use them in the resort's landscaping. Soon after, The Mountain Inn and Conference Center was completed (December 1980), allowing the resort, now owned and managed by Wintergreen Partners, Inc. (WPI), to host conferences and meetings, expand its target markets, and allow guests to stay in slope-side accommodation. = Present = In 2012, Wintergreen was bought for $16.5 million by James C. Justice II, the owner of The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia. Following the acquisition, Justice began several construction projects valued at a total of $12 million, including restaurant upgrades, a multimillion-dollar water tank and new snow guns to facilitate the resort's 100% snow making coverage, as well as improvements to existing recreational facilities. Three years later, in February 2015, the property was sold yet again, this time to EPR Properties of Missouri. This time, however, financial details were not disclosed to the public. As part of the sale, Wintergreen was renamed \\"Wintergreen Pacific Llc.\\" (though continued to do business as Wintergreen Resort), and would be operated by Pacific Group Resorts, Inc.

Temperatures on average fall about 4 ¬∞F for every thousand feet of elevation making Wintergreen's summit typically 10-15 degrees colder than the valley towns. This allows for ample winter snowmaking and increased natural snowfall. However, due to its location well east of the highest ridge of the Appalachians, it receives only about 35 inches a year of natural snow versus some 175 inches in prime spots to the west. Despite lack of heavy, consistent snowfall, Wintergreen is much closer and more convenient to the major population centers on the east coast, such as Washington, D.C. and Richmond.

As a bandleader and accompanist, he explored various styles including swing and cool jazz. Music career Rowles was born in Spokane, Washington and attended Gonzaga University in that city. After moving to Los Angeles, he joined Lester Young's group in 1942. He also worked with Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Les Brown, Tommy Dorsey, Tony Bennett, and as a studio musician. =With female singers= Rowles was praised as an accompanist by female singers. He recorded Sarah Vaughan with the Jimmy Rowles Quintet with Sarah Vaughan and accompanied Carmen McRae on her 1972 live album The Great American Songbook. McRae described Rowles as \\"the guy every girl singer in her right mind would like to work with\\". In the 1950s and 1960s, he frequently played behind Billie Holiday and Peggy Lee. In the 1980s he succeeded Paul Smith as Ella Fitzgerald's accompanist. He first performed with Fitzgerald at the Mocambo nightclub in Hollywood in late 1956. He appeared on several recording sessions with her in the 1960s before joining her for nearly three years in 1981. Rowles appeared on Fitzgerald's final collaboration with Nelson Riddle, The Best Is Yet to Come in 1982. His song \\"Baby, Don't You Quit Now\\", written with Johnny Mercer, was recorded on her final album All That Jazz, released in 1989. In 1983, Rowles worked with Diana Krall in Los Angeles, shortly after she moved from the Berklee College of Music in Boston. He developed her playing abilities and encouraged her to add singing to her repertoire. In 1994, he accompanied jazz singer Jeri Brown on A Timeless Place, the only album containing only his own compositions. =Compositions= Rowles's best known composition is \\"The Peacocks\\", which was recorded on the 1975 album of the same name with Stan Getz. Gary Foster recorded it on his albums Make Your Own Fun and Perfect Circularity. Norma Winstone covered the song with lyrics, accompanied by Rowles, on her album Well Kept Secret. Guitarist John McLaughlin recorded a version on his album The Promise. Esperanza Spalding covered the song on her album Junjo. Jazz pianist Bill Evans recorded a definitive version of \\"The Peacocks\\" on the posthumously released album You Must Believe in Spring (1981). Rowles's piano work was featured prominently on the DePatie-Freleng Enterprises cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (1969‚Äì1971). Rowles died of cardiac arrest in Burbank, California, at the age of 77. His daughter, Stacy (September 11, 1955 - October 30, 2009), was an accomplished jazz trumpeter, singer, and flugelhornist.

Stranded and broke, he meets Jake and Grace McKenna, a father and daughter who are also a married couple. They separately approach Bobby to kill the other for money. Desperate and in fear, Bobby approaches Jake about killing Grace. He becomes attracted to Grace and agrees to kill Jake, then he and Grace can be together and use Jake's money for a new start somewhere else. With Grace's help, Bobby kills Jake, and they leave together with $200,000. As they make their way out of Superior, the Sheriff, with whom Grace has been having an affair, stops them. Grace shoots and kills the sheriff. As they dump the bodies, Grace pushes Bobby over the cliff, severely injuring him. Grace suddenly realizes that Bobby has the car keys. Grace makes her way down the steep incline where she and Bobby fight, and in his weakened, injured state, Bobby kills Grace.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1¬Ω stars out of four, deeming it a \\"repetitive, pointless exercise in genre filmmaking‚Äîthe kind of film where you distract yourself by making a list of the sources\\". James Berardinelli rated the film three stars out of four, stating \\"for those who enjoy movies on the edge, U-Turn offers just the trajectory you might expect.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that it \\"demonstrates a filmmaker in complete command of his craft and with little control over his impulses\\". U Turn currently holds a 61% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews with the consensus: \\"U-Turn is a lurid, stylish lark that boasts striking moments but lacks the focus and weight of Oliver Stone's best work.\\" The film was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Director (which went to Kevin Costner for The Postman) and Worst Supporting Actor (Jon Voight, also for Most Wanted; ultimately, he \\"lost\\" to Dennis Rodman for Double Team).

Roy D'Andrade grew up in Metuchen, New Jersey,Obituary: Roy Goodwin D'Andrade. New York Times. 12 Dec 2016 https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=roy-goodwin- dandrade&pid;=183059426 D'Andrade matriculated at Rutgers University but left to fulfill his military service. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Connecticut. He then studied in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard, from which he received his PhD in Social Anthropology. He taught at Stanford University from 1962-1969. He then moved to the University of California, San Diego, where he was professor of Anthropology until 2003 and served as department chair for three separate terms. He also taught in the Anthropology department at the University of Connecticut. He died of complications of cancer on October 20, 2016. His research interests ranged widely, including African-American family structure, personality, color perception, and mathematical models for reconstructing mitochondrial lineages. A unifying theme in much of his work, however, is the problem of identifying and describing cultural models (also known as folk models, or the often implicit, culturally shared ways that people assume the world works); in recent years he was particularly concerned with conceptualizing cultural through schema theory.Gardner, Howard. (1985). The Mind‚Äôs New Science: a history of the cognitive revolution. New York, NY: Basic Books. Pp: 256-257. One problem that D'Andrade addressed was the challenge of conceptualizing how people reason in their culturally situated worlds. In one set of studies, individuals may do very poorly on abstract tests of formal logic or mathematics, but are quite capable of reasoning accurately and quickly about real-world situations with which they are familiar, and which under formal logic are ostensibly the same task. As Gardner summarizes the work of D'Andrade and his colleagues: \\"we can better understand the logical reasoning of humans not by imputing to them any formal logical calculus but by attending to two factors. The first has to do with content: the greater the familiarity and the richer the relevant schemata which are available, the more readily can one solve a problem. The second attribute has to do with form: one succeeds on problems to the extent that one can construct mental models that represent the relevant information in an appropriate fashion and these those mental models flexibly.\\"Gardner, Howard. (1985). The Mind‚Äôs New Science: a history of the cognitive revolution. New York, NY: Basic Books. Pp: 369-370. Within American anthropology in the 1990s, D'Andrade was known for expressing reservations about mixing moral and scientific aims:Bernard, Allen (2000) History and Theory in Anthropology. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp: 12-14. \\"our moral models about the anthropologist's responsibilities should be kept separate from our models about the world...Otherwise the result will be very bad science and very confused morality.\\" Goleman, Daniel (March 19, 1996) \\"Anthropology Group Takes Activist Stand to Protect Cultures\\".

For 25 years Jerry Douglas reigned in fictional Genoa City as patriarch John Abbott on the daytime television serial The Young and the Restless. In 2006, his character was killed off. However, he has made special appearances since then. Early life Douglas was born Gerald Rubenstein in Chelsea, Massachusetts to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Raised in Chelsea, Massachusetts, he attended Brandeis University in pursuit of an economics degree. Eight months into law school in Boston, he gave up the books and began auditioning for acting roles. However, his lack of training frustrated him, and he eventually moved to California. There he met his first wife, Arlene Martel, who had a young son by the name of Adam Palmer. Douglas went on to have two children with Ms. Martel, Avra Douglas and Jod Douglas (AKA Jod Kaftan). =Personal life= Settling in the San Fernando Valley, Douglas sold insurance by day and took acting classes at night. Although he still struggled, he received encouragement after appearing in the play John Brown's Body. For several years, Douglas appeared on such TV shows as Mission: Impossible and The Feather and Father Gang, often portraying villains. At the same time, Martel decided to move herself and their two children, Avra and Jod, to Carmel. They eventually divorced. He remarried, to Kymberly Bankier, whom he met at a Muscular Dystrophy Association event. They have been married since April 6, 1985, and have a son, Hunter. Later years In March 2006, after 25 years on the show, Douglas departed The Young and The Restless in a storyline-dictated exit revolving around his character's involvement in the Tom Fisher murder case. Douglas claims that former headwriter of The Young and The Restless Lynn Marie Latham killed his character off because she could not understand why a man would run a cosmetics company. He continued to recur on the show for the next few months and was put back on contract with the show in June to play his now-deceased character's ghost. He left the show for good on August 18, but continues to make appearances once in a while. In March 2008 he began appearing as a new character Alistair Wallingford, a drunken hack actor involved in a gaslighting plot, but was written out a few months later. In 2007, Douglas released a CD, The Best Is Yet to Come, a collection of jazz standards, and has performed around the United States and Canada.

Linz and Mae Whitman as their children. The title comes from the 1963 song \\"One Fine Day\\" by The Chiffons, which is heard in the film. Michelle Pfeiffer served as an executive producer on the film, which was made in association with her company Via Rosa Productions. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song (\\"For the First Time\\"). Plot Melanie Parker is an architect and divorced mother to her son, Sammy. Her day gets off to a bad start when she is late to drop him off at school, due to the forgetfulness of fellow divorced father Jack Taylor, a New York Daily News reporter whose daughter, Maggie, is thrust into his care that morning by his ex-wife who leaves to go on her honeymoon with her new husband. The children arrive just a moment too late to go on a school field trip (a Circle Line boat cruise). Their parents are forced to accept that, on top of hectically busy schedules, they must work together that day to supervise each other's child. In their confusion of sharing a taxi, they accidentally switch cell phones, causing each of them, all morning, to receive calls intended for the other one, which they then have to relay to the right person. Melanie must make an architectural design presentation to an important client. Jack has to find a source for a scoop on the New York mayor's mob connections. Sammy causes havoc at Melanie's office with toy cars, causing her to trip and break her scale model display. In frustration, she takes him to a day care center (which is having a \\"Superhero Day\\"), where she coincidentally comes across Jack trying to convince Maggie to stay and behave herself. They create impromptu costumes for the children, using his imagination and her resourcefulness. She takes her model to a shop to get it quickly repaired. Having left for a meeting, she panics when she receives a phone call from Sammy about another child having a psychedelic drug. She phones Jack in desperation and asks him to pick up the children. He agrees, on the condition that she take over their care at 3:15 while he chases down a potential news source. While in Melanie's care, Maggie goes missing from a store, and wanders some distance down a crowded midtown sidewalk. Melanie breaks down in despair at the police station, files a missing child report, and then goes to a mayoral press conference to find Jack. He is notified by the police that Maggie has been found, and makes it to the press conference just barely in time to confront the mayor with his scoop about corruption. He had earlier tracked down its source, just as she was leaving a beauty salon in a limousine. Although they have been antagonistic, Melanie and Jack work together to get the children, by taxi, to a soccer game. She insists that she will have time first to do her presentation to the new clients, despite him protesting that it will make them late for the game. She begins her pitch over drinks at the 21 Club lounge, but upon seeing Sammy in high spirits, she realizes that she cares more about him than her job. Bravely insisting that she must leave immediately to be with him, she fully expects to be fired, yet the clients are impressed. At the game, Melanie meets her ex- husband, Eddie, who is a musician and who admits that he lied to Sammy about taking him fishing in the summer and that he will be going on tour as a drummer with Bruce Springsteen instead. That evening, Jack wants a reason to visit Melanie's apartment, so he takes Maggie to buy goldfish to replace the ones that were eaten earlier in the day by a cat. At Melanie's apartment, the children watch TV while she and Jack share a first kiss. She goes to the bathroom to freshen up; when she returns, an exhausted Jack is asleep on the sofa. She joins him and they fall asleep together, with the children happily observing. Cast * Michelle Pfeiffer as Melanie Parker * George Clooney as Jack Taylor * Alex D.

She does everything in this movie that a much better movie would have required from her, but the screenplay lets her down... Pfeiffer looks, acts and sounds wonderful throughout all of this, and George Clooney is perfectly serviceable as a romantic lead, sort of a Mel Gibson lite. I liked them.

After a slow start, he became, along with Alfred Shaw the greatest slow bowler of the 1870s. He played in the first Test match and remains the oldest player to make their debut in Test cricket. Early career Southerton began his cricketing life during the 1850s as a batsman for Sussex. In 1861, Southerton was engaged at Southampton and resided at the Antelope Ground until 1867.Antelope Ground, Southampton, England, CricInfo. Retrieved 9 March 2009. During this period Southerton, operating in a period before regulations prevented anyone playing for more than one county in the same season, played for both Sussex and Hampshire. It was not until 1865 that Southerton developed the slow bowling for which he was to gain belated fame and set many records. At a time when bowling was mainly fast round-arm, Southerton‚Äôs slower speed with its deceptive flight and sharp break was a challenge for batsmen that they did not adapt to easily. Southerton had much more than spin and flight, however. He was able to vary his pace and pitch very well, often deceiving batsmen by bowling a ball outside the off stumpGrace, William Gilbert (21 June 1890) Forty Years of Cricket, The Sydney Mail. which turned on the under-prepared pitches of his time viciously into the right-handed batsmen. Southerton typically would then bowl a faster, straighter ball as a contrast, and was exceptionally strong at knowing which ball would be most difficult for each individual batsman. Like Lancashire‚Äôs Alec Watson, who was often called \\"the Southerton of the North\\", the fairness of Southerton‚Äôs delivery was sometimes called into question. Upon leaving Southampton, Southerton played for Surrey as well as Sussex and Hampshire, and with more cricket to play because of Surrey‚Äôs longer programme,Wynne-Thomas, Peter (1983) The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records, p.53.

Two years later Southerton became the first bowler to reach 200 wickets in a first-class season, and played in as many as twenty- seven of only forty-nine first-class matches played during the year.First Class Bowling in Each Season During this period it was said that Southerton was the one bowler able to defeat or even contain the brilliant batting of W. G. Grace.Rae, Simon (1998) W.G. Grace: A Life, pp.94, 106.

Phreatophytes are plants that are supplied with surface water and often have their roots constantly in touch with moisture. A phreatophyte is one that absorbs its water from a constant source on the ground. They can usually be found along streams where there is a steady flow of surface or groundwater in areas where the water table is near the surface. Phreatophytes live in areas with standing or running water, in arid areas and along the riverbeds and areas, apparently dry, where the water table is very shallow and near the surface. These plants have very deep roots that are able to reach the water table. Phreatophytes are not only characteristic of arid or desert zones, but also of wetlands, floodplains, depressions that hold water and estuaries. In the wetlands, ecological classification does not provide a special classification, since in this case, most of the plants in the regions of high rainfall can deepen their roots to the top of the capillary fringe immediately above the water table, and function well as a phreatophyte. In this case they receive the label of mesophytic. Phreatophytic artificial extensions, manmade, are used as a method to purify greywater. Biological value They are plants of great ecological value, fast growing pioneers and highly resistant to disease. They make excellent fodder for livestock and provide nesting areas and shelter for fauna. They are used as fuel, cheap construction material, and basketry. Many of the plants grow in degraded waters, salty or saline, that are useless for agriculture. Phreatophyte plants help to purify these waters and their roots fix heavy metals with a bacterial filter. For example, it is estimated that the total annual groundwater phreatophytes consumed in the western U.S. alone is about 30,000 hm3 Phreatophytes are indicators of potable groundwater. Phreatophytes can be differentiated into plant communities by the length of their root, as they extend more or less deeply into the aquifer. Meinzer Studies. O.E. (1927) and Robinson, T.W. (1958) on vascular plants in the arid western U.S., set up certain general types of indicator species, according to level of minimum depth of the water table at which water was at the maximum suction RO. Some phreatophytes have a low tolerance for salt, indicating freshwater. This can be a valuable guide to the location of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semiarid areas. Examples of phreatophytes include Welwitschia and mesquite: Prosopis glandulosa. The alfalfa, or Medicago sativa, is a widespread phreatophyte plant of great economic value. Trees like the ash, the alder, the willow and the poplar are also useful in this regard. These trees generally grow in freshwater aquifers where the water table depth is not more than ten meters. These species are found in riparian ecosystems and areas characterized by shallow groundwater, such as bottomlands. They are also present in water limited environments; for example, oaks in the Mediterranean climate regions.

Users are charged a rate based on how much waste they present for collection to the municipality or local authority. A variety of models exist depending on the region and municipality. Waste can be measured by weight or size, or by unit counts, identified using different types of bags, tags, containers or even RFID. Services for waste diversion, like recycling and composting, are often provided free of charge where pay-as-you-throw systems are implemented.Batllevell, Marta and Kenneth Hanf. ‚ÄúThe fairness of PAYT systems: Some guidelines for decision-makers.‚Äù Waste Management 28 (2008): 2793-2800. There are three main types of pay-as-you-throw programmes: \\\\- Full- unit pricing: users pay for all the garbage they want collected in advance by purchasing a tag, custom bag, or selected size container. \\\\- Partial-unit pricing: the local authority or municipality decides on a maximum number of bags or containers of garbage, with collection paid for by taxes. Additional bags or containers are available for purchase should the user exceed the permitted amount \\\\- Variable-rate pricing: users can choose to rent a container of varying sizes (some programs offer up to five), with the price corresponding to the amount of waste generated.Kelleher, Maria, et al. ‚ÄúTaking out the Trash: How to Allocate the Costs Fairly.‚Äù C.D. Howe Institute Commentary 213 (2005): 1-22. Rationale The two most traditional approaches to disposing of municipal solid waste are a flat-rate system or municipal taxes. All users pay the same flat rate or tax regardless of how much waste they present for pickup.Bilitewski, Bernd. ‚ÄúPay-as-you-throw ‚Äì A tool for urban waste management.‚Äù Editorial. Waste Management 28 (2008): 2759. Under the flat-rate system there is no incentive to reduce waste produced.Reichenbach, Jan. ‚ÄúStatus and prospects of pay-as-you-throw in Europe ‚Äì A review of pilot research and implementation studies.‚Äù Waste Management 28 (2008): 2809-2814. PAYT is based on two guiding principles of environmental policy: the polluter pays principle and the shared responsibility concept. The rationale for PAYT can be divided into three broad categories: =Economic= Under a PAYT scheme, some or all of the costs of waste management can be removed from property tax bills, providing more independence in the management and financial of residential waste system. Waste management services are then treated just like other utilities such as electricity or water that are charged by unit of consumption. =Environmental= The PAYT programs are an effective tool in increasing waste separation, recycling, and waste minimization. The result is significant energy savings from transportation, increases in material recovery from recycling, and reduction in pollution from landfills and incinerators. Therefore, it reduces the load of landfills. Additionally, PAYT programs also indirectly encourage producers to develop more efficient designs and environmentally friendly product life cycles. =Social= Waste collections costs are distributed more fairly among the population, and in proportion to the amount of waste each user generates. Free riders are no longer able to have their behavior subsidized, and PAYT is said to promote community sustainability. Lower-income families tend to produce less waste and thus pay lower waste collection fees. Diversion effects and risks Charging for waste can also sometimes result in illegal dumping (fly- tipping) or the waste being passed to unlicensed or illegal disposal methods. In practice, increased litter, open burning, and illegal dumping have not been observed by most pay-as-you-throw communities, especially when combined with easier recycling and composting.http://www.scdhec.gov/library/OR-0608.pdfhttp://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/recycle/reduce/pay- as-you-throw-basics-for-municipalities.html Municipalities in Massachusetts have typically observed a reduction in trash larger than the increase in recycling, but this is believed to be due to people formerly bringing in trash from other communities (where presumably there is no free pickup) to the homes of friends and relatives.http://radioboston.wbur.org/2011/04/12/mass- recycling-program Political opposition When there is a change to any established municipal service, public resistance is common. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recommends making PAYT programs revenue-neutral by reducing taxes at the same time as introducing trash fees so residents don't see the latter as a new cost. Implementation Urban communities usually offer curbside collection while rural communities provide drop-off collection service. Both the European Union and the US Environmental Protection Agency have published handbooks for introducing PAYT.Sakai, S., et al. ‚ÄúUnit-charging programs for municipal solid waste in Japan.‚Äù Waste Management 28 (2008): 2815-2825. =North America= PAYT programs operated in California, Michigan, New York and Washington as early as the 1970s, although The City of San Francisco ‚Äúhad practiced a kind of PAYT scheme since 1932.‚Äù By 2000, 6,000 communities in the U.S. (20%) and 200 in Canada had implemented user fees for waste management. In 2002 North Americans disposed of 24 million tonnes of waste, with residential sources accounting for 9.5 million tonnes. PAYT programs resulted in residential waste declining from 9 - 38% and increased recycling from 6 ‚Äì 40%. =Europe= Austria was the first country to implement individual waste charging in 1945, but PAYT did not catch on until the 1980s when efficient and secure systems became available to account for usage of disposal services electronically. The first city in Europe to implement an electronic identification and billing system for waste charges was Dresden, Germany, in 2004. The first experience in Spain was in 2003.Puig Ventosa, I. \\"Charging systems and PAYT experiences for waste management in Spain\\". Waste Management 2008, 28, 2767‚Äì2771 Since 1991, the European Waste Policy has required that ‚Äúpart of the costs not covered by revenues from material reuse must be recovered on the polluter-pays principle.‚Äù Versions of PAYT are present in municipalities all over Europe. =Asia= After being introduced in the 1970s, 954 municipalities (30%) in Japan have implemented PAYT programs. The city of Taipei currently runs a scheme where households and companies purchase specially printed blue bin bags, and place waste in it. The municipal waste management department collects only rubbish placed within these special bags. Called the \\"Per Bag Trash Collection Fee\\", this scheme encourages usage of recyclable packaging, as those do not need a special bag and are disposed free of charge. As a result, Taipei's waste volume is down 35.08%, and recycling has increased 2.6-fold from 1999.What I Picked Up About Trash in Taipei - washingtonpost.com PAYT is also implemented in Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Republic of China(Taiwan).Hong, Seonghoon. ‚ÄúThe Effects of unit pricing system upon household solid waste management: The Korean Experience.‚Äù The Journal of Environmental Management 57 1999): 1-10. PAYT pricing has also been recently introduced in parts of Bangalore through the wastepicker cooperative Hasiru Dala, founded by Nalini Shekar.

The Fedoseevtsy movement was born amidst the Old Believers (mostly peasants and posad people) in Northwest Russia. It was founded by an ex-deacon Feodosy Vasilyev (1661-1711). The Fedoseevtsy were displeased with a certain group within the Bespopovtsy, namely Pomortsy, who had been diverging from the strict principles of the Old Believers and adopted a custom of praying for the tsar (–º–æ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–∞ —Ü–∞—Ä—è). Initially, the Fedoseevtsy were irreconcilable towards the serfdom in Russia and observed strict asceticism, negating the institution of marriage. In the late 18th century, the Fedoseevtsy centered on a group led by Ilya Kovylin (1731-1809) with their all-Russian \\"headquarters\\" at the Preobrazhenskoye cemetery in Moscow. With the development of social inequality among the Fedoseevtsy, their doctrine gradually began to lose its elements of social protest. In 1848, they adopted the custom of praying for the Tsar. In the second half of the 19th century, a group of the so-called \\"newlyweds\\" (–Ω–æ–≤–æ–∂—ë–Ω—ã) detached itself from the Fedoseevtsy movement, acknowledging the institution of marriage.

This organic compound is a conjugated 10 pi electron cyclic system and according to Huckel's rule it should display aromaticity. It is not aromatic, however, because various types of ring strain destabilize an all-planar geometry. The all-cis isomer (1), a fully convex decagon, would have bond angles of 144¬∞, which creates large amounts of angle strain relative to the ideal 120¬∞ for sp2 atomic hybridization. Instead, the all-cis isomer can adopt a planar boat-like conformation (2) to relieve the angle strain. This is still unstable because of the relative higher strain in boat shaped compared to the next planar trans, cis, trans, cis, cis isomer (3). Yet even this isomer is also unstable, suffering from steric repulsion between the two internal hydrogen atoms. The nonplanar trans, cis, cis, cis, cis isomer (4) is the most stable of all the possible isomers. [10]annulenes The [10]annulene compound can be obtained by photolysis of cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene as a mixture of isomers. Because of their lack in stability even at low temperatures the reaction products revert to the original dihydronaphthalene. Aromaticity can be induced in compounds having a [10]annulene-type core by fixation of the planar geometries. There exist two methods to bring it about. One way is to replace two hydrogen atoms by a methylene bridge (--) gives the planar bicyclic 1,6-methano[10]annulene (5). This compound is aromatic as indicated by from lack in bond length alternation seen in its X-ray structure and evidence of telltale diamagnetic ring current in its NMR spectrum. synthetic route to 1,6-methanonapthalene A classical organic synthesis of this compound starts from a Birch reduction of naphthalene to tetrahydronaphthalene (or isotetralin), is followed by carbene addition of dichlorocarbene (prepared in- situ from chloroform and the potassium salt of tert-butanol) followed by a second organic reduction that removes the chloride substituents and is concluded by the organic oxidation by 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). Another way to restore planarity, and therefore aromaticity, in [10]annulene rings is incorporation of a methine bridge to a tricyclic[10]annulene core structure (6). When deprotonated to form the anion this type of compound is even more stabilized. The central carbanion makes the molecule even more planar and the number of resonance structures that can be drawn is extended to 7 included two resonance forms with a complete benzene ring. By computational chemistry it is demonstrated that the tricyclic[10]annulene derivative with an annulated benzene ring and a full set of cyano substituents (7) is one of the most acidic compounds known with a computed pKa in DMSO of ‚àí30.4 (compared to for instance ‚àí20 for magic acid). Azulene is also a 10 œÄ-electron system in which aromaticity is maintained by direct transannular bonding to form a fused 7‚Äì5 bicyclic molecule.

It was founded by journalist Richard Boston, with funding from Monty Python member Terry Jones. The magazine was intended to have a more light-hearted tone than the other countryside and ecology magazines of the time. The founders' working title for the magazine (shortened when it began actual publication) was The Questing Vole, a quotation from the fictitious nature column written by William Boot, the protagonist of Evelyn Waugh's novel Scoop (1938) ‚Äì \\"Feather-footed through the plashy fens passes the questing vole\\". The magazine contributed to raising awareness of serious Green politics at a time when many people's view of the issue was coloured by the BBC sitcom The Good Life.

In June 1980, the managing editor of Vole was Charles Alverson. Issue numbering and format The numbering of the issues was somewhat irregular. From September 1977 to August 1978 issues were numbered 1 to 12 (though number 8 was misnumbered as 7, subscription copies being manually corrected). The next issue, published in October 1978, began a new volume: it was numbered Vol. 2 No. 1, and this numbering continued to Vol. 2 No. 11, dated October 1979 (but actually published in September). Volume 3 began with No. 1, dated October 1979, and continued to Vol. 3 No. 10, dated July 1980. At this point the format changed to a tabloid size for the remaining three issues of the volume, No. 11, October 1980, to No. 13, December 1980. Volume 4, nos. 1‚Äì8, retained the tabloid format, and ran from January 1981 to September 1981. Voles ISSN was 140-4571.

In his reminiscences to James Pycroft in 1836, Beldham said that, when he was eighteen years old in the 1784 season, he had played for Farnham against Hambledon and scored 43 runs.Underdown, p. 157. He was watched by George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea who was cricket's most influential patron at the time and, the following spring, Winchilsea visited Beldham at the farm where he worked and arranged with his employer for him to have time off in order to play cricket. Beldham was invited to play for Hampshire in June 1785 against All-England at White Conduit Fields, the start of his career in top-class cricket. Although his last recorded first-class match was in 1821 (aged 55), there is strong anecdotal evidence that he continued to play - in his Oxford Memories, Pycroft stated \\"Beldham's was a green old age. Even when between sixty and seventy [1826‚Äì1836] he was barred in county matches\\".James Pycroft (1886) Oxford Memories. Vol. II, Richard Bentley & Sons. p. 126. =Gentlemen v. Players= Beldham had the unusual record of playing for both the Gentlemen and the Players in the first two Gentlemen v Players matches in 1806. He and William Lambert played as given men for the Gentlemen in the first match and Beldham returned to the Players team for the second match. Beldham made further appearances in the fixture after it was resurrected in 1819. He played for the Players in 1819, 1820 and 1821. Style and technique Although he was remembered primarily as a fine attacking batsman, Beldham was an all- rounder who took many wickets by operating as a change bowler. When he was interviewed by James Pycroft, Beldham claimed that he, William Fennex and Harry Walker had revolutionised batting by introducing the cut (Walker) and forward play (Beldham and Fennex).Harry Altham (1962) A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin. p. 46. This is contradicted by John Nyren who says that the earlier Hambledon batsman Tom Sueter was noted for his cut shot and probably invented forward play, being the first player known to leave his crease and play the drive.Nyren, p. 60. In The Cricketers of My Time, Nyren eulogised Beldham's batting prowess: \\"...(he was) safer than the Bank\\"; \\"...he would get at the balls and hit them away in gallant style. But when he could cut them at the point of his bat, he was in all his glory; and, upon my life, their speed was as the speed of thought\\"; \\"...one of the most beautiful sights that can be imagined, and which would have delighted an artist, was to see him make himself up to hit a ball. It was the beau ideal of grace, animation, and concentrated energy\\".Nyren, pp. 90‚Äì91. Arthur Haygarth, writing in 1862, was of the opinion that Beldham was \\"an excellent judge of a short run, had a good knowledge of the game and was a very fine field\\".Arthur Haygarth (1862) Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744‚Äì1826), Lillywhite, p. 72. His bowling delivery was \\"high and well, pace moderate, yet bordering on the fast and getting up quick\\". Personality Beldham was described by Nyren, who knew him personally, as \\"a close-set, active man, standing about five feet eight inches and a half\\". He was called \\"Silver Billy\\" because of his light- coloured hair and fair complexion. During a period of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: \\"You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this once, I could say I never was bought in my life ; and this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the disappointed betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ\\".James Pycroft (1886) Oxford Memories. Vol. II, Richard Bentley & Sons. p. 125. Family and personal life Beldham retired to Tilford, where he was initially the landlord for some years of a public house, The Barley Mow, and spent his last 41 years there. The census returns of 1841, 1851 and 1861 refer to him as, variously, a \\"bat maker\\" and an \\"old cricketer\\". In his seventies, he was interviewed by James Pycroft, author of The Cricket Field.James Pycroft (1854) The Cricket Field, Longman One of the common misconceptions concerning Beldham is that he fathered anything up to thirty six children by two wives. While he did marry twice, he was in reality far less prolific: by his first wife Ann Smith (1765‚Äì1800) he had one daughter whilst with his second wife, another Ann (1779‚Äì1869) he had eight children between 1804 and 1819. Beldham died in 1862 and is buried, althong with his second wife, in the local churchyard in unmarked graves which are thought to be in the north-west corner. Beldham's cottage still sits by the side of the pub, albeit with the later addition of an upper floor.Collyer, p. 17. Beldham's sister Hannah (1786‚Äì1842) married another leading cricketer of the day, John Wells. As late as 1861, forty years after his last important game and while he was still living, a wall of The Cricketers pub in Wrecclesham still bore the legend \\"Rendezvous of those Famous Cricketers Beldham & Wells\\" (another version has the sign as \\"Good Beer as drunk by those Famous Men Beldham & Wells\\"). Legacy The July 1862 edition of London Society magazine reported that \\"Old Beldham died last winter (February) near Farnham, aged ninety-six. Not long before, the old man was invited to Lord's, and received with all honours in the pavilion: he was also advertised as expected at the Oval, to increase the attraction of a match between the old players and the young\\".London Society magazine, July 1862 edition, p.240. In 1997, in an article in The Times, former Wisden editor John Woodcock named Beldham in his 100 Greatest Cricketers of All Time. Simon Wilde rated him as the best batsman in the world for the period 1787 to 1805.Simon Wilde (1998) Number One: The World's Best Batsmen and Bowlers, Gollancz. . p. 26 He is the earliest cricketer for whom a photograph exists.The Cricketer, Spring Annual 1962, p. 67.

Saint-Pierre is the more populated of the two communes (municipalities) making up Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Geography The commune of Saint-Pierre is made up of the island of Saint-Pierre proper and several nearby smaller islands, such as L'√éle-aux-Marins. Although containing nearly 90% of the inhabitants of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the commune of Saint-Pierre is considerably smaller than the commune of Miquelon-Langlade, which lies to its northwest on Miquelon Island. The main settlement and communal seat is situated on the north side of a harbour called Barachois, which faces the Atlantic Ocean, on the Saint- Pierre Island's east coast. The mouth of the harbour is guarded by a small chain of islands. History Jacques Cartier claimed the islands for France in 1536, after they were discovered by the Portuguese in 1520. At the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the islands were turned over to Britain, only to be given back to France in 1816. St. Pierre was an outpost used by Al Capone to transport alcohol from Canada to the United States during Prohibition. Until 1945, there existed a third commune in Saint Pierre and Miquelon: L'√éle- aux-Marins. The commune of L'√éle-aux-Marins was annexed by the commune of Saint-Pierre in 1945. Demographics The legal population of Saint-Pierre in 2017 was 5,406, many of whom are of Basque, Breton, Norman or Acadian descent. All inhabitants in the commune (municipality) live on the island of Saint- Pierre proper. Government The commune is led by a mayor and a council. Saint-Pierre under snow. Saint-Pierre on a cloudy day. Landmarks Close to the centre of the harbour's edge lie the Post office and Custom House (staffed by Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes), behind which is General Charles de Gaulle Square, the town's centre. Other prominent landmarks in Saint-Pierre include the cathedral, to the north of the square, rebuilt in the early twentieth century after a major fire, and the Pointe aux Canons Lighthouse, at the mouth of the harbour. Further north, close to the town's former hospital, is the Fronton Zazpiak Bat - an arena for the traditional Basque sport of pelota.

He lived in Sheffield for the majority of his life, taking roles at both Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United. He started his football league career with Lincoln City in 1946, but made only two appearances for them before joining Sheffield Wednesday the following year. In his time at Hillsborough he was a prolific goalscorer for Wednesday. Between 1950 and 1953 he scored 62 goals in 61 league games for the Owls, along with one goal from his two FA Cup appearances. His career was cut short when an infected leg had to be amputated following a serious fracture in his last match for the club. Early life Derek Dooley was born on 13 December 1929 in Pitsmoor, Sheffield. At the time Wednesday were in the process of successfully defending their Division 1 title. Both his mother and father were factory workers. Work commitments had prevented his father from having a trial with Bradford City. He went to Owler Lane School where they played football 2 hours a week. He was put in the senior team at the age of 13. After leaving school at the age of 14 he took a job at a hearing-aid factory and played football for a Sheffield YMCA. 'Pop' Bennett, the manager of the YMCA, wanted to play him at centre-half but Dooley insisted that he would play at centre- forward or not at all. The manager relented and he was played up front where he became a prolific scorer. A year later he was given an opportunity with Lincoln City. Playing career He was signed for Lincoln as an amateur and still played for the local YMCA. He played for the reserves side for two seasons becoming their top scorer. Towards the end of the 1946‚Äì47 season he played two matches for the first team side scoring a goal on each occasion. Lincoln decided to offer him a part-time contract but he declined as he wanted to help Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association to the final of Northern Counties Championship. It was at the final that he was spotted by Sheffield Wednesday scout Tommy Walker. A meeting with Eric Taylor, the Wednesday manager, was organised and as his contract with Lincoln had lapsed he was signed immediately. In four years he scored 55 goals in 38 appearances in Wednesday's third team (playing in the Yorkshire League) side and 37 goals in 49 for their reserve side, who played in the Central League. This included 8 goals in a single match. He was given his first chance at first team football in March 1950 against Preston North End. It was the first of two games in the 1949‚Äì50 season but he failed impress in either. A poor 1950‚Äì51 season led to the Owls being relegated to Division 2 on goal difference. Wednesday's poor form continued the following season winning just three of the first nine matches. Dooley earned a recall for the next match against Barnsley. He took full advantage of the chance scoring two goals to help Wednesday to a 2‚Äì1 victory. This was followed by three matches where he only added a solitary goal but at the beginning of November he found a goal scoring touch that would make him Sheffield Wednesday most prolific scorer of all time. His goal scoring run started with him scoring 22 goals in 9 matches. He went on to score a total of 46 goals in his first season, surpassing the 25-year-old record of 37 goals that was held by Jimmy Trotter. The tally remains a club record to the present day. The season finished with the Owls being promoted back to Division 1 as champions. After a slow start to the 1952‚Äì53 season Dooley eventually achieved a respectable 16 goals in 24 games but his career was abruptly ended on 14 February 1953, when he collided with the Preston goalkeeper George Thompson at Deepdale and broke his leg. An x-ray revealed that he sustained a double fracture. As he was preparing to leave hospital the following Monday a nurse noticed that there was no reaction in his toes when touched. When the Orthopedic cast was removed it was found that a small scratch on the back of his leg had become infected. Gangrene had set in and it was decided to amputate his leg. It was rumoured at the time that a chemical from the white touchline marking had got into his injury. Career after playing After the injury a testimonial was played between a Sheffield XI and a team of internationals. It was attended by 55,000 supporters and raised ¬£7,500. Another ¬£2,700 was donated by local newspapers and ¬£15,000 by a shilling fund held in the city. During the years immediately following the injury he took a job with a firm owned by one of the club directors. He also worked with the Wednesday junior team. He was put in charge of the club's development fund when it was launched in 1962. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London's Kings Cross station. Dooley became Sheffield Wednesday manager in January 1971 with the team in the lower half of the Second Division and having just exited the FA Cup. There were 16 games left in the season. Under Dooley's charge they won 3 matches collecting 11 points leaving them in 15th place at the end of the season. This was followed by another stuttering season that saw them finish just a place higher. The 1972‚Äì73 season would prove to be Dooley's most successful in his short managerial career. Wednesday led the Second Division for a period near the beginning of the season eventually finishing 10th. The highlight of the season was beating First Division Crystal Palace. The next season started badly. The team was badly hit by a virus that affected a total of 16 players between early September and November. The board was radically changed in early December when the chairman and vice-chairman both resigned. Despite a slight improvement in form the new board decided to sack Derek Dooley on 24 December 1973. The decision left him bitter about his treatment and it would be almost twenty years before he would set foot in Hillsborough Stadium again. After being sacked by Wednesday he took a job in public relations at a Leeds firm. He was then offered the position of Commercial Manager at the Owls' bitter rivals Sheffield United. He went on to have a variety of roles including the role of managing director before taking on the job of chairman of United's Football Club board. He also co-founded the \\"Senior Blades Club\\", with the late George McCabe.\\"Senior Blades Club\\" , co- founder with George McCabe: SUFC official website. Retrieved on 26 March 2008. Later life After declining several previous offers he finally accepted an invitation to watch the Sheffield derby at Hillsborough in 1992. There he was given a standing ovation by both sets of fans. He was also made a freeman of the City of Sheffield in 1993. In 2003, he was awarded an MBE in the New Years Honours List. and later the same year an honorary doctorate degree from Sheffield Hallam University. He retired as a Blades chief executive in 1996 but 3 years later he returned to the fold as chairman of the club. At the time United were ¬£4 million in debt and languishing near the bottom of the second tier of English football. Under his chairmanship the club enjoyed a resurgence that saw them return to the Premiership after an absence of 12 years. In April 2006 with the club still celebrating promotion, Dooley announced his resignation of the chairmanship to take up the role of Vice-President. Death Dooley died at home on 5 March 2008. Both Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United opened their own books of condolence the following day. United announced on 6 March 2008 that they will be naming their new youth academy after their former chairman. The following day the Blades announced that they would also be commissioning a statue of Dooley, which would be placed to the rear of the South Stand at Bramall Lane. There was a minute's silence prior to Wednesday's home game against QPR and Barnsley's FA Cup quarter-final tie against Chelsea on 8 March. Dooley's funeral took place on 14 March 2008 at Sheffield Cathedral. The cathedral was surrounded by thousands of fans from Sheffield's two major clubs who listened to the service on loudspeakers. Inside, the service was attended by Sir Bobby Charlton, Dickie Bird and former United managers Neil Warnock and Dave Bassett, both of whom read eulogies. Following the service a police motorbike outrider led the funeral cort√®ge to a private service at a city crematorium. Permanent tributes In 2008, the Council decided to rename part of the ring road as Derek Dooley Way,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7518759.stm BBC News on Derek Dooley Way announcement a move supported by his widow, Sylvia. In 2010, a statue of Dooley was erected at the Bramall Lane home of Sheffield United, to commemorate his service to the club.

He is best known as the lead singer for the 1990s re-incarnation of the Misfits from 1995 to 2000, leaving briefly in 1998. Graves grew up in Dumont, New Jersey.\\"'70s punk band fits pieces back together.\\", The Star-Ledger, May 6, 1996, p.43. \\"Graves of Dumont\\" He has also released several albums as a solo artist. Life and career =Misfits= Graves was recording a demo with his band the Mopes in Lodi, New Jersey, when their engineer, Bob Alecca, mentioned that the Misfits were reforming and holding auditions for a new singer. Graves bought the Collection I and Walk Among Us albums to familiarize himself with the band and became an official member about a year after trying out. In September 2008 Graves confirmed that he would return to The Misfits if asked. \\"Jerry and I do not have a dysfunctional working relationship. Him and I both know and I know he knows that I am on board. It is a phone call away. I won't step back into what I walked away from, but the problem isn't with Jerry and I. The problem is with Doyle and with Chud.\\" On December 26, 2009 Graves appeared on stage with Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein and Dr. Chud's band Gorgeous Frankenstein at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville NJ who was opening for Danzig. While on stage the band (along with Graves on vocals) played four late 1990s-era Misfits songs: Helena, Lost in Space, Scarecrow Man, and Shining, but they were cut short from playing Dig Up Her Bones due to time. Graves' singing can be found on American Psycho, Famous Monsters, backup vocals on the 1999 single \\"Monster Mash\\" and \\"Cuts from the Crypt\\". He also wrote original songs for the band, including \\"Dig Up Her Bones\\", \\"American Psycho\\", \\"Scream!\\", \\"Saturday Night\\", \\"This Island Earth\\", \\"Fiend without a Face\\", \\"Shining\\", \\"The Haunting\\",\\"Devil Doll\\", \\"Witch Hunt\\", and \\"Fiend Club\\". =Lost Boys= During a break in touring in 2000, Graves and Dr. CHUD formed a band called The Lost Boys. They played two shows before the Misfits regrouped to embark on another tour, which was their last tour with this line-up. The first Lost Boys show consisted of Graves on an acoustic guitar and vocals while Dr. CHUD played drums. They played Misfits songs they had written while in the band as well as songs which later came to be songs used for the band Graves which Graves wrote. The second show was the same music played as the first show, only this time the lineup consisted of Graves on vocals and electric guitar (he used Doyle's old Ibanez Iceman which has been used to record such Misfits albums as \\"Walk Among Us\\" and \\"Earth A.D./Wolfsblood\\" and was given to Graves as a gift upon joining the Misfits back in 1995), Dr. CHUD on drums and J~Sin Trioxin on bass. Later on as an encore set, JV Bastard took the stage and joined the band to play guitar as Graves sang. The four played \\"classic\\" Misfits songs from the 1977 to 1983 era of the band. =Graves= After Graves and Dr. Chud's split with the Misfits on October 25, 2000, they formed the band Graves which made one album called Web of Dharma. Before the band finished writing songs, recording, touring and even solidifying a lineup, Graves rejoined the Misfits, but only as a guest vocalist for a month during the M25 kickoff tour. He would perform Misfits songs written during the time of his tenure with the band to raise money for his new project, Graves. During a two-day break on their Web of Dharma 2 Tour, the band recorded what was to be new material for a second album in Ripsnorter Studios, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The studio is owned by members of the Minneapolis Horror Rock band, Ripsnorter, who offered the band free studio time. The recordings were never finished due to disagreements between the mixing of the songs and have never officially been released. After two successful US tours and the verge of a breakout record contract, Graves dissolved due to differences between Graves and Chud, after only releasing one album. =Gotham Road= Graves then formed Gotham Rd shortly after with Loki, JV Bastard and Paul Lifeless. Under the assumed name of Graves they recorded a five-song demo of redone Graves songs, three which were released on Web of Dharma and two other songs which had been written and demoed with the original Graves lineup, but not officially released. Around this time is also when Graves announced via his website that he would begin producing other bands albums on his off time. One such band is Stressbomb from Connecticut who recorded their first album \\"Self Medicate\\" with Graves as producer and his drummer Quincy as engineer during January 2006. After a few months of the band practicing, they decided to change the band's name to Gotham Rd. They released one album before going on hiatus so Graves could join the U.S. Marines. His last show ever was to be on December 31, 2004. They went on two successful tours. 2003's Seasons of the Witch tour, and 2004's Mourning Lights tour. Before their Mourning Lights tour, the band entered a studio to record three new songs they had written after their first tour. Out of the three songs only one, the song on \\"My Way\\", had been mixed. The only way it was available for listening was by requesting it on Seton Hall University's WSOU, Pirate Radio. Before going on indefinite hiatus they'd play one off shows in New Jersey when home from the Punk Rock is Dead, Graves solo tour. Their second to last show to date was held at the now defunct Connections in Clifton, New Jersey, in March 2005. The band announced \\"The Nightmare Rides Are Back\\" all over the net and played a one-time-only reunion show in Belmar, New Jersey, at the Goodwill Fire Hall with Cryptovyrus, The Zombie Mafia, Morbid Visions and Johnny B. Morbid. They played a mix of material from Graves' solo works, Graves re-records, and Gotham Road, as well as some Misfits songs written by Graves. In 2008 and 2009 the band contributed some songs to the German compilation-CDs Get acquainted Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. =Solo projects and beyond= 2005-2008 Right before his leave for the Marines, Graves was approached by Horror High Records to do a solo album. He eventually recorded his debut solo record Punk Rock is Dead in 2005. The entire album was written and recorded with friend and bandmate in Gotham Road, Paul Lifeless on drums in only one month. After being honorably discharged due to a back injury, Graves went to embark on a tour in support of the album with Loki, JV Bastard and Matt Johnson. In March 2006, Graves began a tour in support of Damien Echols and the West Memphis Three. Matt Johnson was replaced with Quincy Smash, who has played bass guitar for one of Graves' bands, The Mopes, before the Misfits. To coincide with the 2006 Halloween/Almost Home 2 tour, Graves' second solo effort titled Return to Earth was released on Halloween day of 2006. Graves has written an album entitled Illusions with Echols. The album consists of 15 songs and has been released October 31, 2007. The lyrics are written by Echols and Graves, and feature J~Sin Trioxin and Quincy Smash. A year later, in October 2008, Graves released Illusions Live/Viretta Park, a combination live album and demo EP. It was recorded on 24 April 2008, at Club Bourbon in New Port Richie, Florida, and 8 and 9 July 2008, at Bucharest, Romania. Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg Graves began touring as the singer for Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, which features the namesake drummer and at one stage members of the band Antiproduct, although the band now features a rotating line up. The band covers vintage Ramones songs live, and in 2010 recorded a cover of a Graves original song called \\"When We Were Angels\\", Originally featured on Illusions. In March 2011, Blitzkrieg also released another song written by Graves entitled, \\"If and When.\\" 2012-Present In March 2012 Graves met Mark Allen Stuart, CEO of Hydraulic Entertainment. After several meetings discussing potential projects Stuart and Graves decided to create their first CD \\"Vagabond\\". On September 28, 2012, Michale began a pledge through Kickstarter to release a new album titled Vagabond, which eventually was released on 6 February 2013. With Vagabond Graves showed a completely different side of his songwriting, as the album genre ranges between Folk, Rock and Country. The release marked the beginning of the highly productive and successful partnership between Graves and Hydraulic Entertainment. On 27 August 2013, the album Vagabond Acoustic has been released, containing 8 acoustically performed songs from Vagabond with a short description of each song. Later in 2012 a second Kickstarter release was announced, Lost Skeleton Returns, which Graves referred to as a return to horror punk, and stated would feature 10 re-recorded classics as well as four new songs. Lost Skeleton Returns was released on June 20, 2013. Motionless In White vocalist Chris Motionless provided guest vocals on the track \\"Forbidden Planet\\". The album was supported by nationwide touring with Graves performing as his infamous \\"Skele-Crow\\" character for the first time in nearly a decade. Following the release of Lost Skeleton Returns, an instrumental version of the album was issued and made available to fans online. An extremely limited number of copies of this edition were made. An acoustic album called Supernatural was released on 7 February 2014, and features acoustically performed songs of Lost Skeleton Returns. On 3 June 2014, Graves released a new album titled Wanderer, a musical follow-up to Vagabond, which was successfully funded through his Kickstarter project. An acoustic version of the record called \\"Wanderer Acoustic\\" was released on 3 February 2015, following the tradition of Vagabond Acoustic and Supernatural. Later in 2015 a CD titled The Hydraulic Entertainment Demo's Volume 1 with demo recordings of songs from Vagabond, Lost Skeleton Returns, Vagabond Acoustic and Supernatural has been released. In January 2016 the full band album When Worlds Collide has been released as the follow-up to Graves' album Lost Skeleton Returns. The album contained 11 new songs and combined Punk, Horror Punk and Monster Rock in Graves' typical manner. The record also included the sequel to the classic fan-favorite \\"Crying on Saturday Night\\", which is called \\"Dying on Sunday Morning\\". In Summer 2016 Graves recorded and released the album Bedlam, which is the acoustic counterpart to \\"When Worlds Collide\\". A new take on \\"Dying on Sunday Morning\\" has been added with the song \\"Feels Like I'm Dying\\". In the spirit of \\"Lost Skeleton Returns Instrumental\\" Graves released \\"When Worlds Collide Instrumental\\" later that year. Graves and Hydraulic Entertainment also made the demos of \\"When Worlds Collide\\" available for the fans and released a limited CD with early versions of the songs. So far Graves has produced and worked on 14 music projects/albums with Hydraulic Entertainment. Other projects / guest vocals Along with the month long writing/recording session of \\"Punk Rock is Dead\\", Graves also laid down vocal tracks for the band \\"Summer's End\\"'s debut self-titled release. He wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals for the song \\"Headwound.\\" Graves wrote and sang on the album \\"The All-Star Sessions\\" made by all the bands which reside on the Roadrunner record label before his departure into the Marines. His vocals can be found on the track he penned with Trivium's guitarist/singer Matt Heafy, \\"I Don't Wanna Be (A Superhero)\\". Graves appeared as a guest vocalist on the song \\"Zombie Romance\\" in Snow White's Poison Bite's album \\"Snow White's Poison Bite: Featuring Dr. Gruesome And The Gruesome Gory Horror Show\\", released on April 16, 2013. In October 2014, Graves and the Russian punk band \\"Night Of Samhain\\" released a double-album on the Hydraulic Entertainment label. The first disc contains the entire album with English vocals, translated and sung by Graves. The second disc contains the original album by \\"Night of Samhain\\", sung in Russian by the band's lead singer Michael Shaforostov. The concept for the 2 CD album was created by Hydraulic Entertainment CEO Mark Allen Stuart and the project was nominated for an Independent Music Award - Album of the Year. In 2015 the second double-album \\"Revenge of the Zombies\\" was released, featuring acoustic renditions of songs from \\"Zombies Unite\\". The first 8 tracks are English versions performed by Michale Graves, while the second 8 tracks are Russian versions performed by \\"Night of Samhain\\". On 28 August 2015, Graves started another Kickstarter campaign for \\"Nightmares\\", featuring a collection of classic horror stories read by himself. The project was successfully funded and released in late 2015. On 27 August 2016, the Swedish punk band \\"Zombiesuckers\\" released their album \\"From Ashes\\", including the single \\"Endless Sleep\\" featuring lead vocals by Graves.  Political views  Graves joined the conservative punk website in the early 2000s. In 2004, he was interviewed on his conservative positions on a piece for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He became a libertarian in 2013. In 2020, Graves endorsed the far right group Proud Boys in an Instagram post. The post was later deleted.

It is based upon the 1831 novel Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) by the French novelist Victor Hugo. The music was composed by Riccardo Cocciante (also known as Richard Cocciante) and the lyrics are by Luc Plamondon. Since its debut, it has been professionally played in Belgium, Canada, China, France, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States, and has been translated into eight languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Korean, Flemish, Polish, and Kazakh). A shorter version in English was performed in 2000 in Las Vegas, Nevada (United States) and a full-length London production, also in English, ran for seventeen months. Several songs from the show, such as \\"Vivre\\", \\"Belle\\" and \\"Le temps des cath√©drales\\", have been released as singles with a huge success in French speaking countries. Notre-Dame de Paris, according to the Guinness Book of Records, had the most successful first year of any musical ever. The score has been recorded at least seven times to date (2007): the original French concept album, which featured Israeli singer Achinoam Nini (aka Noa) as Esmeralda was followed by a live, complete recording of the original Paris cast. A complete recording of the score in Italian was made, along with a single disc of highlights in Spanish from the Barcelona production. The original London cast album featured several of the original Paris stars, but only preserved a fraction of the score in English. Synopsis =Act I= The story is set in Paris in the year 1482. The poet Gringoire, who throughout the story acts not only as a participant but also as a sort of commentator, enters to set the scene for the story; he relates how Man has written his history in the building of the cathedrals (\\"Le temps des cath√©drales\\"). The homeless and refugees, led by Clopin, swarm before the entrance to the Cathedral of Notre Dame begging for help and sanctuary (\\"Les sans-papiers\\"). Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, orders Phoebus, the Captain of the Royal Archers, to have his men disperse the crowd (\\"Intervention de Frollo\\"). As his men are driving off the refugees, Phoebus catches sight of the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda (in later productions, the scene changes to have him see her while she is dancing before Notre Dame) and is entranced by her. Esmeralda tells him about herself, her life as a gypsy, and her dreams (\\"Boh√©mienne\\"). Instead of arresting her, Phoebus leaves her alone. Clopin, who has watched over Esmeralda since she was eight years old after the death of her parents, tells her that she is no longer a child and that she has reached the age where she will discover love (\\"Esmeralda tu sais\\"). He warns her to be extremely careful, since not all men are to be trusted. In the next number, the audience is introduced to the nobly-born and beautiful Fleur-de-Lys, to whom Phoebus is engaged to be married. Fleur-de-Lys's love for Phoebus is childish and irrational, like that of Juliet for Romeo (\\"Ces diamants-l√†\\"). Now begins the wild and coloured Feast of Fools, presided over by Gringoire (\\"La f√™te des fous\\"), the climax of which is the choosing of the King of Fools from among the group of people who can make the ugliest face; the King will be crowned by Esmeralda. Hiding in the shadows is a monstrous figure who is dragged out into the light; it is the bell-ringer of Notre Dame, the hunchbacked and facially deformed Quasimodo. By unanimous decision, Quasimodo is chosen and crowned as the King of Fools, but he knows that for all the power he has this one day nothing can make a woman such as Esmeralda care for him (\\"Le pape des fous\\"). Frollo breaks up the festivities and orders Quasimodo to kidnap Esmeralda and bring her to him that night so that she can be imprisoned as a sorceress and a violator of public decency (\\"La sorci√®re\\"). Quasimodo, who is devoted to Frollo for raising and educating him after he had been abandoned as a baby (\\"L'enfant trouv√©\\"), says he will obey. Night falls on Paris with its dark and hidden secrets commented on by Gringoire (\\"Les portes de paris\\"). Quasimodo stalks Esmeralda through the dark streets and is about to seize her when Phoebus and his guards arrive and arrest Quasimodo. Phoebus introduces himself to Esmeralda. He makes a date for a rendezvous with her the next night at the Cabaret du Val d'Amour. Phoebus and his men take Quasimodo away and Esmeralda darts off into the darkness (\\"Tentative d'enl√®vement\\"). At the Court of the Miracles, the haven for all of the outcasts of Paris, Clopin presides over a wild revel, remarking that all are truly equal here no matter their race, religion, skin color or criminal background (\\"La cour des miracles\\"). Gringoire, who has wandered in accidentally, is seized and Clopin tells him that he will be hanged for his trespassing ‚Äì unless one of the women will agree to marry him. Esmeralda who has arrived during this, agrees to marry Gringoire (in name only) and Clopin, as King of the Outcasts, unites them and they join in the wild revelry. Later, when Gringoire and Esmeralda are left alone (\\"Le mot Phoebus\\") he introduces himself to her as \\"the Prince of the Streets of Paris\\" and assures her that while he is not a \\"ladies' man\\" (\\"un homme a femmes\\"), he would be glad if she would be his Muse and inspiration. Since Gringoire is educated, Esmeralda asks him what the word \\"Phoebus\\" means; he tells her that in Latin it means \\"the sun\\" or \\"sun god\\". Esmeralda muses on the word as it romantically relates to the man Phoebus (\\"Beau comme le soleil\\"); she is joined on stage by Fleur-de-Lys, who also muses on Phoebus (although she seems to be more apprehensive about him), but both believe that Phoebus will love them forever. Phoebus himself is under no apprehensions about what kind of man he is ‚Äì he wants both women, one as a wife and one as a temporary mistress (\\"D√©chir√©\\"). The next day, Frollo summons Gringoire to Notre Dame and questions him about Esmeralda, forbidding him to touch her. Gringoire changes the conversation by asking about a strange inscription in Greek on the wall of the Gallerie des Rois in Notre Dame, the word \\"Anark√©\\". Frollo tells him that \\"Anark√©\\" means \\"Fate\\" in Greek. They watch as Quasimodo is dragged on stage bound on The Great Wheel as sentence for his attempted kidnapping of Esmeralda (\\"Anarkia\\"). Quasimodo endures his punishment, but cries out for water (\\"A boire\\"), a plea that is ignored by everyone. Suddenly Esmeralda appears and gives him a drink of water from her cup, an act of kindness that deeply touches the poor hunchback. He is then released from the Wheel, and he, Frollo and Phoebus sing about their different feelings for Esmeralda (\\"Belle\\"): Quasimodo about his growing feelings of tenderness for her, Frollo about his growing fascination for her, and Phoebus (watched jealously by Fleur-de-Lys) about his wish for an affair with her before he marries Fleur-de-Lys. Quasimodo leads Esmeralda into Notre Dame and tells her how the cathedral has been his home and sanctuary, and now it can be hers whenever she needs one (\\"Ma maison c'est ta maison\\"). In spite of her initial fear of this strange, deformed man, Esmeralda is touched by his gentleness and finds herself warming towards Quasimodo. Left alone, Esmeralda, who has never prayed before, prays to the Virgin Mary (\\"Ave Maria pa√Øen\\"), while Quasimodo thinks of her (\\"Si tu pouvais voir en moi\\"). Frollo, secretly spying on Esmeralda, realizes that his lust for her will destroy him, but knows that he cannot resist nor does he want to (\\"Tu vas me d√©truire\\"). That night, Phoebus is on his way to the Cabaret du Val d‚ÄôAmour for his rendezvous with Esmeralda when he realizes he is being stalked by a shadowy figure. The figure (Frollo in disguise) warns him to go no further (\\"L'ombre\\"), but Phoebus refuses to heed the threat and continues on his way. At Val d‚ÄôAmour, Gringoire (who seems to be a regular customer) remarks how everyone, no matter the race, creed or color, comes here for a good time of one kind or another ... for a very low price (\\"Le Val d‚ÄôAmour\\"). Phoebus arrives (he seems to be a regular customer here too) and meets Esmeralda in a private room (\\"La volupt√©\\"). They embrace and are about to make love when Frollo rushes in and stabs Phoebus with Esmeralda's knife (which she had placed on the floor earlier). Esmeralda collapses over Phoebus‚Äô body, Frollo makes his escape and Gringoire, Clopin, Frollo, Quasimodo and the Chorus comment on the terrible power of Fate (\\"Fatalit√©\\"). =Act II= Frollo and Gringoire discuss the events and scientific discoveries taking place and how some of them (such as Johannes Gutenberg‚Äôs printing press and Martin Luther‚Äôs doctrines) are changing the world forever (\\"Florence\\"). Gringoire notices how silent the cathedral is and Frollo tells him that Quasimodo has not rung the bells for three days. Up in the bell tower, Quasimodo recounts how the cathedral bells are his only friends and loves (\\"Les cloches\\"), especially the three \\"Maries\\": \\"Little Marie\\" which is rung for children's funerals, \\"Big Marie\\" which is rung when ships set sail and \\"Great Marie\\" which is rung for weddings. His greatest hope is that they will ring for Esm√©ralda to hear that he loves her. Frollo asks Gringoire where his \\"wife\\" is (\\"Ou est Elle?\\"); Gringoire says he does not know and answers obliquely (but he tells Clopin, who has been searching for Esmeralda, that she has been imprisoned in the prison of La Sainte and that she will be hanged if Clopin doesn't save her). In her cell, Esmeralda compares herself to a caged bird and calls to Quasimodo to save her, while back at Notre Dame Quasimodo wonders about Esmeralda's disappearance three days earlier and fears for her safety (\\"Les oiseaux qu'on met en cage\\"). Clopin and a group of outcasts are arrested and thrown into the La Sainte prison (\\"Condamnes\\") as Esmeralda is put on trial for the attempted murder of Phoebus and sorcery with Frollo as presiding judge (\\"Le proc√®s\\" / \\"La torture\\"); when she refuses to confess, she is subjected to a foot-crushing torture until she cries out \\"I confess!\\" Frollo sentences her to death by hanging, but Esmeralda still professes her love for Phoebus and Frollo is left to suffer from the emotional torment of his unrequited passion (\\"√ätre pr√™tre et aimer une femme\\"). Esmeralda calls Phoebus to save her (‚ÄúPhoebus‚Äù) Elsewhere, a recovered Phoebus is confronted by Fleur-de-Lys, but he claims as an excuse that he was bewitched by Esmeralda's \\"sorcery\\" (\\"Je reviens vers toi\\"). Fleur-de-Lys tells him that he will still have her heart and love if he will swear to have Esmeralda executed (\\"La monture\\"). At five o'clock in the morning of the execution, Frollo visits Esm√©ralda's cell and to her horror confesses to her that he knifed Phoebus out of love for her (\\"Visite de Frollo a Esmeralda\\" / \\"Un matin tu dansais\\") and offers her a choice: death on the gallows or life by giving him love. When Esmeralda rejects his advances, he tries to rape her, but Quasimodo (who has secretly followed him) frees Clopin and the other prisoners. Clopin attacks Frollo, knocking him unconscious, and releases Esm√©ralda and they flee the prison to Notre Dame for sanctuary (\\"Liberes\\"). Gringoire sings to the moon (\\"Lune\\") in which he describes Quasimodo's pain and suffering because of his love for Esm√©ralda. Quasimodo leaves Esmeralda asleep in a safe place in Notre Dame (\\"Je te laisse un sifflet\\"), but bitterly reflects that while he will love her forever, his ugliness will ensure that she will never love him (\\"Dieu que le monde est injuste\\"). Alone, Esmeralda hopes that she will survive for the man she loves and sings about how Love has the power to change the world even should she die (\\"Vivre\\"). With Clopin and his people occupying Notre Dame, Frollo orders Phoebus and his men to break sanctuary and attack the cathedral to drive them out (\\"L‚ÄôAttaque de Notre Dame\\"). Clopin and his people resist bravely but are no match for the armed soldiers, and in the first attack Clopin is fatally wounded. Dying, he begs Esmeralda to take his place as leader. The final battle has Esmeralda and her people facing off against Phoebus and his soldiers, but the result is a foregone conclusion ‚Äì Esmeralda is captured and the outcasts defeated. Phoebus coldbloodedly hands Esmeralda over to be executed, orders the outcasts driven out of Paris (\\"D√©port√©s\\") and leaves with Fleur-de-Lys. Quasimodo, searching Notre Dame for Esmeralda, finds Frollo standing at the top of one of the towers and begs him to help Esmeralda (\\"Mon maitre, mon sauveur\\"). Frollo, finally driven insane, shows him the sight of Esmeralda being hanged and to Quasimodo's horror announces that he is responsible. As he laughs wildly, the enraged Quasimodo seizes him and hurls him down the stairs of the tower to his death. As the executioners are cutting down Esmeralda's body from the gibbet, Quasimodo appears and demands that they give him her body (\\"Donnez-la moi\\"). Driving them away, he kneels beside her body and mourns her, promising to stay with her and that even in death they will not be parted (\\"Danse, mon Esmeralda\\"). After the curtain call, Gringoire leads the cast in a reprise of \\"Le temps des cath√©drales\\".

The orchestra and chorus were prerecorded; the principals wore very obvious boom microphones. Critical response in Great Britain Critical reception in Great Britain was mixed, with praise for the music and choreography, and general disdain for the English translation of the lyrics and the show's overall direction. For example, The Times praised the \\"doleful energy\\" of Garou's Quasimodo and the \\"occasional imaginative production touches: huge bells with writhing, upside-down humans for clappers\\" but concludes \\"Another Les Mis this isn't.\\" The Daily Mail called it \\"concert with dance, lighting effects and a lot of French singers throwing their hair around in a collective display of gravelly-voiced pique.\\" According to the Oxford Encyclopedia of Popular Music, the producer of the London show Michael White fought back this criticism: \\"This is not a musical but a rock show with a strong storyline. I think it is difficult for dramatic critics who have to understand everything from Shakespeare to Harold Pinter to understand that.\\" Eventually, despite initially poor reviews, Notre-Dame de Paris \\"became the most successful of the Gallic-themed shows to open in the West End during 2000\\". Production history The original production of ‚ÄúNotre-Dame de Paris‚Äù made musicals fashionable again in France and, since its inception, has spawned a number of other notable productions. As part of the publicity prior to the Paris opening three songs were released as singles: \\"Vivre\\", \\"Le temps des cath√©drales\\", and \\"Belle\\". \\"Belle\\" became a huge hit, and was named Song of the Year in France, and nominated for Song of the Century. Since its debut, the show has been professionally played in Belgium, Canada, China, France, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, Ukraine and United States, and has been translated into seven languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Korean, Flemish, and Polish). A shorter version in English was performed in 2000 in Las Vegas, Nevada (United States) and a full-length London production, also in English, ran for seventeen months. Several songs from the show, such as \\"Vivre\\", \\"Belle\\" and \\"Le temps des cath√©drales\\", have been released as singles with a huge success in French speaking countries. An English version of \\"Vivre\\" (Live for the One I Love) was released by both Celine Dion and Australian chanteuse Tina Arena, and appears on the original London cast recording, even though Dion did not participate in the musical. In 2010-2014 several concert versions of the musical which reunited the original cast were presented in Kiev, Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Paris and Beirut.Notre Dame de Paris Concert ‚Äì Beirut.com In February 2016 it was announced that a revival of the original musical Notre Dame de Paris is scheduled to open in November 2016 in the Palais des Congr√®s in Paris, followed by a tour in France.¬´Notre Dame de Paris¬ª revient au Palais des Congr√®s 18 ans apr√®s Notre-Dame de Paris, according to the Guinness Book of Records, had the most successful first year of any musical ever.

This conjugate Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLewis superacid system was developed in the 1960s by the George Olah lab at Case Western Reserve University, and has been used to stabilize carbocations and hypercoordinated carbonium ions in liquid media. Magic acid and other superacids are also used to catalyze isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons, and have been shown to protonate even weak bases, including methane, xenon, halogens, and molecular hydrogen. History The term \\"superacid\\" was first used in 1927 when James Bryant Conant found that perchloric acid could protonate ketones and aldehydes to form salts in nonaqueous solution. The term itself was coined by R. J. Gillespie later, after Conant combined sulfuric acid with fluorosulfuric acid, and found the solution to be several million times more acidic than sulfuric acid alone. The magic acid system was developed in the 1960s by George Olah, and was to be used to study stable carbocations. Gillespie also used the acid system to generate electron-deficient inorganic cations. The name originated after a Christmas party in 1966, when a member of the Olah lab placed a paraffin candle into the acid, and found that it dissolved quite rapidly. Examination of the solution with 1H-NMR showed a tert-butyl cation, suggesting that the paraffin chain that forms the wax had been cleaved, then isomerized into the relatively stable tertiary carbocation. The name appeared in a paper published by the Olah lab. Properties =Structure= Although a 1:1 molar ratio of HSO3F and SbF5 best generates carbonium ions, the effects of the system at other molar ratios have also been documented. When the ratio SbF5:HSO3F is less than 0.2, the following two equilibria, determined by 19F NMR spectroscopy, are the most prominent in solution: :Magic acid structure (In both of these structures, the sulfur has tetrahedral coordination, not planar. The double bonds between sulfur and oxygen are more properly represented as single bonds, with formal negative charges on the oxygen atoms and a formal plus two charge on the sulfur. The antimony atoms will also have a formal charge of minus one.) In the above figure, Equilibrium I accounts for 80% of the NMR data, while Equilibrium II accounts for about 20%. As the ratio of the two compounds increases from 0.4‚Äì1.4, new NMR signals appear and increase in intensity with increasing concentrations of SbF5. The resolution of the signals decreases as well, because of the increasing viscosity of the liquid system. =Strength= All proton-producing acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid are considered superacids, and are characterized by low values of the Hammett acidity function. For instance, sulfuric acid, H2SO4, has a Hammett acidity function, H0, of ‚àí12, perchloric acid, HClO4, has a Hammett acidity function, of ‚àí13, and that of the 1:1 magic acid system, HSO3F¬∑SbF5, is ‚àí23. Fluoroantimonic acid, the strongest known superacid, is believed to reach extrapolated H0 values down to ‚àí28. Uses =Observations of stable carbocations= Magic acid has low nucleophilicity, allowing for increased stability of carbocations in solution. The \\"classical\\" trivalent carbocation can be observed in the acid medium, and has been found to be planar and sp2-hybridized. Because the carbon is surrounded by only six valence electrons, it is highly electron deficient and electrophilic. It is easily described by Lewis dot structures because it contains only two-electron, two- carbon bonds. Many tertiary cycloalkyl cations can also be formed in superacidic solutions. One such example is the 1-methyl-1-cyclopentyl cation, which is formed from both the cyclopentane and cyclohexane precursor. In the case of the cyclohexane, the cyclopentyl cation is formed from isomerization of the secondary carbocation to the tertiary, more stable carbocation. Cyclopropylcarbenium ions, alkenyl cations, and arenium cations have also been observed. :File:Cyclopentyl_cation.png As use of the Magic acid system became more widespread, however, higher-coordinate carbocations were observed. Penta- coordinate carbocations, also described as nonclassical ions, cannot be depicted using only two-electron, two-center bonds, and require, instead, two- electron, three (or more) center bonding. In these ions, two electrons are delocalized over more than two atoms, rendering these bond centers so electron deficient that they enable saturated alkanes to participate in electrophilic reactions. The discovery of hypercoordinated carbocations fueled the nonclassical ion controversy of the 1950s and 60s. Due to the slow timescale of 1H-NMR, the rapidly equilibrating positive charges on hydrogen atoms would likely go undetected. However, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and 13C NMR have been used to investigate bridged carbocation systems. One controversial cation, the norbornyl cation, has been observed in several media, Magic acid among them. :File:Norbornyl cation.gif The bridging methylene carbon atom is pentacoordinated, with three two-electron, two-center bonds, and one two-electron, three-center bond with its remaining sp3 orbital. Quantum mechanical calculations have also shown that the classical model is not an energy minimum. =Reactions with alkanes= Magic acid is capable of protonating alkanes. For instance, methane reacts to form the ion at 140 ¬∞C and atmospheric pressure, though some hydrocarbon ions of greater molecular weights are also formed as byproducts. Hydrogen gas is another reaction byproduct. In the presence of FSO3D rather than FSO3H, methane has been shown to interchange hydrogen atoms for deuterium atoms, and HD is released rather than H2. This is evidence to suggest that in these reactions, methane is indeed a base, and can accept a proton from the acid medium to form . This ion is then deprotonated, explaining the hydrogen exchange, or loses a hydrogen molecule to form ‚Äì the carbonium ion. This species is quite reactive, and can yield several new carbocations, shown below. : Larger alkanes, such as ethane, are also reactive in magic acid, and both exchange hydrogen atoms and condense to form larger carbocations, such as protonated neopentane. This ion is then cloven at higher temperatures, and reacts to release hydrogen gas and forms the t-amyl cation at lower temperatures. : It is on this note that George Olah suggests we no longer take as synonymous the names \\"alkane\\" and \\"paraffin.\\" The word \\"paraffin\\" is derived from the Latin \\"parum affinis\\", meaning \\"lacking in affinity.\\" He says, \\"It is, however, with some nostalgia that we make this recommendation, as ‚Äòinert gases‚Äô at least maintained their ‚Äònobility‚Äô as their chemical reactivity became apparent, but referring to ‚Äònoble hydrocarbons‚Äô would seem to be inappropriate.\\" =Catalysis with hydroperoxides= Magic acid catalyzes cleavage-rearrangement reactions of tertiary hydroperoxides and tertiary alcohols. The nature of the experiments used to determine the mechanism, namely the fact that they took place in superacid medium, allowed observation of the carbocation intermediates formed. It was determined that the mechanism depends on the amount of magic acid used. Near molar equivalency, only O‚ÄìO cleavage is observed, but with increasing excess of magic acid, C‚ÄìO cleavage competes with O‚ÄìO cleavage. The excess acid likely deactivates the hydrogen peroxide formed in C‚ÄìO heterolysis. : Magic acid also catalyzes electrophilic hydroxylation of aromatic compounds with hydrogen peroxide, resulting in high-yield preparation of monohydroxylated products. Phenols exist as completely protonated species in superacid solutions, and when produced in the reaction, are then deactivated toward further electrophilic attack. Protonated hydrogen peroxide is the active hydroxylating agent. =Catalysis with ozone= Oxygenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by a magic acid‚ÄìSO2ClF solution in the presence of ozone. The mechanism is similar to that of protolysis of alkanes, with an electrophilic insertion into the single œÉ bonds of the alkane. The hydrocarbon‚Äìozone complex transition state has the form of a penta-coordinated ion. : Alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes are oxygenated by electrophilic insertion as well. Safety As with all strong acids, and especially superacids, proper personal protective equipment should be used. In addition to the obligatory gloves and goggles, the use of a faceshield and full-face respirator are also recommended. Predictably, magic acid is highly toxic upon ingestion and inhalation, causes severe skin and eye burns, and is toxic to aquatic life.

Its name is Dutch for northern public garden. History In 1874 the Vestingswet was passed. This law allowed cities to expand outside of the city walls and fortifications. Since the fortifications were no longer in use, they were transformed into a public park. The earth ramparts were incorporated in the park architecture and the moats were turned into ponds. The architecture is of an English garden style, characterized by meandering paths and serpentine ponds, inspired by wild nature. The shape of the park still reflects the former purpose of the area: the long but narrow park curves around the old city. The park includes an Art Nouveau bandstand and a small restaurant. Until the mid-90s the Noorderplantsoen was split up by a busy road, but a referendum in 1994 decided - with a narrow majority - to close this road for motorized traffic. Events Every year a number of events take place in the Noorderplantsoen, of which the Noorderzon Theater Festival is well known. This cultural event takes place at the end of August and is visited by over 125,000 visitors. Many theater, dance and music groups from The Netherlands and abroad perform during this 11-day festival.

The mall is currently anchored only by Macy's. There are three recently closed anchor spots all in 2019, one formerly occupied and still owned by JCPenney, another by Lord & Taylor, and the last by Sears. History =1970s= Lakeforest Mall first opened September 12, 1978. At that time, the mall's anchor stores were JCPenney, Sears, Woodward & Lothrop, and Hecht's. The mall was one of the first in the United States to feature an indoor ice skating rink on the lower level, in the \\"H section\\". The rink has since been superseded first by a multi-theater movie complex, then by a food court, which now occupies the place. =1990s= In 1995, the Woodward & Lothrop at the mall closed and was replaced by Lord & Taylor. Lakeforest was host to a Friendly's and a Long John Silver's during the 1990s; they have since closed down. =2000s= Originally developed, owned and operated by Taubman Centers, the Simon Property Group owned and managed the mall from 2007, when it purchased former owner and manager Mills Corporation. The company defaulted on its mortgage in 2011 and the mall was put up for sale after. =2010s= In 2012, the mall took in $14,680,000 in net income. In 2013, Five Mile Capital Partners hired real estate developer Hines to \\"map out a long-term plan for Lakeforest\\". The children's play area and nearby fountain were removed and tiled over that year. In 2016, the mall took in $6,180,000 in net income. On August 22, 2017, Gaithersburg's Lakeforest Mall was sold at auction for $19.1 million, a fraction of the $100 million price tag from 2012.

He was a member of the Catholic Constitutional party and sat in the Belgian Chamber of Deputies as member for Eeklo. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the cabinet of Jules Joseph d'Anethan as minister of the interior. However his official career was short. The cabinet appointed as governor of Limburg one Decker, who had been entangled in the financial speculations of Langand-Dumonceau by which the whole clerical party had been discredited, and which provoked riots. The cabinet was forced to resign, and thereafter Kervyn de Lettenhove devoted himself entirely to literature and history. He had already become known as the author of a book on Jean Froissart (Brussels, 1855), which was crowned by the French Academy. He was also a correspondent of foreign scientific societies, and pre√´minent in his own country as an investigator of the national antiquities. He made translations of some of Milton's shorter poems (1839) and edited the Lettres et n√©gociations de Philippe de Commines (1867). He edited a series of chronicles: Chroniques relatives √† l'histoire de la Belgique sous la domination des ducs de Bourgogne (Brussels, 1870‚Äì1873), R√©lations politiques des Pays Bas et de l'Angleterre sous le regne de Philippe II (Brussels, 1882‚Äì1892), and L'Oeuvre de Georges Chastellain (Brussels, 1863‚Äì1866). He wrote a history of Les Hugenots et les Gueux (Bruges, 1883‚Äì1885) in the spirit of a violent Roman Catholic partisan, but with much industry and learning.

It is situated on the border between Forest Park and Fairfield, at the junction of Interstate 275 and Winton Road (Exit 39). The mall, built in phases between 1988 and 1989 as Forest Fair Mall, has become noted for its troubled history; despite being the second-biggest mall in the state and bringing many new retailers to the market, it lost three anchor stores (B. Altman and Company, Bonwit Teller, and Sakowitz) and its original owner LJ Hooker to bankruptcy less than a year after opening. The mall underwent renovations throughout the mid 1990s, attracting new stores such as Kohl's, Burlington Coat Factory, and Bass Pro Shops. Mills Corporation renamed the property to Cincinnati Mills in 2002 and renovated the mall once more. Following the sale of Mills's portfolio to Simon Property Group, the mall was sold several times afterward, while continuing to lose many of its key tenants. After having been renamed to Cincinnati Mall and again to Forest Fair Village in the 2010s, the property has dwindled to fewer than five tenants as of 2017, and plans of redevelopment have largely been stalled. Kohl's and Bass Pro Shops are among the few remaining stores. History Initially, the site at the northeast corner of the Interstate 275 beltway's interchange with Winton Road was to consist solely of Bigg's, a local hypermarket chain. Australian retail developer LJ Hooker acquired the property from original developer Amega in 1986 and chose to make Bigg's an anchor store to a large enclosed shopping mall, which would be named Forest Fair Mall. According to these plans, the mall would consist of of retail space, with 70 percent of the building in Forest Park and 30 percent in Fairfield. By July 1987, mall developers had also stated that two other department stores had committed to the project: Higbee's and Bonwit Teller. Overall, Forest Fair Mall would be the second-biggest mall in the state of Ohio at the time of construction, behind only the now defunct Randall Park Mall in North Randall, a suburb of Cleveland. Also in 1987, Hooker bought controlling interest in both Bonwit Teller and three other department stores: B. Altman and Company, Parisian, and Sakowitz. B. Altman was confirmed as a tenant in November 1987 and Parisian in March 1988, while negotiations with Sakowitz began in October 1988. =19881990: Opening and early years= The first phase of the mall, featuring Bigg's and approximately 20 other stores, opened on July 11, 1988. A month prior to this, Higbee's withdrew from the project after being purchased by a joint venture of Dillard's and Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. As a result, B. Altman was relocated from its originally planned store to the space vacated by Higbee's, thus leaving a vacant anchor store and causing delays in opening the rest of the mall. Immediately after the Bigg's wing of the mall opened, Elder- Beerman was confirmed for the vacated anchor left behind by B. Altman's relocation. As a result, the rest of the mall's opening was delayed to October 1988, and again to March 1, 1989. About one-third of the mall tenants were open by this day, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman, Parisian, and the food court. By mid-year, Elder-Beerman and Sakowitz had also opened. Other tenants included an Australian restaurant called Wallaby Bob's, a 1950s-styled cafe, Oshman's Sporting Goods, and an eight-screen movie theater called Super Saver. Many of the tenants were unique at the time: Wallaby Bob's was \\"the first brewery-restaurant in the nation that operates in a suburban shopping mall\\", while another tenant, Koala Klubhouse, was the first licensed day care to be located in an American shopping mall. Another major tenant present at opening day was a entertainment complex called Time Out, featuring a carousel and miniature golf course. A 1989 article in The Cincinnati Enquirer described the mall as \\"entering uncharted waters\\" due to Sakowitz, B. Altman, Parisian, and Bonwit Teller all being not only new to the Cincinnati market, but also due to the higher-priced merchandise available at those stores, in comparison to the area's more blue collar demographics. LJ Hooker filed for bankruptcy soon after the mall opened, due to debt accrued by the company's expansion in the United States. The company put Forest Fair up for sale in June 1989, with an asking price of $200 million. At this point, only 65 percent of the inline mall space was occupied, and the mall was described as \\"struggling\\" due to the large number of vacancies, primarily in the B. Altman wing. The proximity to both Northgate Mall and Tri-County Mall was also cited as a factor in the mall's struggles, particularly due to the latter undergoing an expansion not long after Forest Fair opened. Despite the mall's troubles, the owners of Parisian noted that the store's sales were strong enough for the company to consider expansion in the Cincinnati market. As part of LJ Hooker's bankruptcy filing, the company offered all four of the department stores it had acquired for sale. Parisian was sold back to its previous ownership, while the other three department stores were ordered to undergo liquidation. The other six B. Altman stores began liquidation in November 1989, although the Forest Fair store was kept open at the time, due to concerns by LJ Hooker's lawyers that closing the store would lower the mall's value. Liquidation sales began in August 1990 at Forest Fair's locations of all three department stores. All of the other Sakowitz stores were also liquidated at this point, along with all but two locations of Bonwit Teller. These locations, both in Upstate New York, were sold to The Pyramid Companies. In October 1990, the mall was sold to a partnership called FFM Limited, headed by a group of banks which had loaned to LJ Hooker most of the $250 million in construction costs. =1990s: The Shops at Forest Fair and redevelopment= In 1992, the owners announced a new concept for the mall, known as The Shops at Forest Fair. Under this concept, each wing would focus on a different theme of shopping. The southwestern wing anchored by Parisian and Elder-Beerman became \\"The Fashions at Forest Fair\\", featuring apparel and traditional department stores; the northwestern wing, formerly home to B. Altman, became \\"The Lifestyles at Forest Fair\\", with stores focused on home decor, entertainment, and sporting goods; the eastern wing anchored by Bigg's became \\"The Markets at Forest Fair\\", which featured tenants centered on \\"value, services, and convenience\\"; and the former Bonwit Teller and center court became \\"The Festival at Forest Fair\\", focused on entertainment and new restaurants. Also, Lexington, Kentucky-based clothing store Dawahares opened its first Ohio store in the vacated Sakowitz space, while Subway and Hot Dog on a Stick joined the food court. By June 1993, further new tenants had opened, including a Sam Goody/Suncoast Motion Picture Company music and video superstore in the Lifestyle wing and a CompUSA electronics store in the Markets wing. At the time, each of the other wings was about 90 percent leased except for the Lifestyle wing, which was only 25 percent leased. Due to the increased traffic brought on by the new stores, many new retail developments were constructed at the I-275 interchange, while the increase in businesses also boosted tax revenues in Forest Park. Although a home furnishings store called HOME had been proposed for the former B. Altman store as part of the 1992 renovations, the space ultimately remained vacant until late 1994, when Kohl's opened there, as the first of three stores opened that year upon the chain's entry into the Cincinnati market. The mall was put up for sale again in 1995, with FFM noting that the partnership did not intend to maintain ownership for over five years. Although Phillips Edison & Company had placed a bid for the property, that company was outbid by Miami, Florida-based Gator Investments, whose purchase of the property was brokered in January 1996. In 1996, Meijer opened across the street from the left side of the mall. Several anchor stores in the mall changed under Gator's ownership: Dawahares closed in late 1996 due to poor sales, Berean Christian Stores signed a 10-year lease for a Christian bookstore at the mall in late 1997, while Parisian closed in June 1998 and Guitar Center replaced CompUSA in August 1998 after that store moved to a larger location across from Tri-County Mall. A gym called Moore's Fitness also opened during this timespan. alt=A two-story, carpeted concourse in a largely abandoned shopping mall. Present is a sign reading \\"Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World\\". In late 1999 and early 2000, Gator Investments began a second renovation plan which attracted several new tenants. Under these plans, they worked with Glimcher Realty Trust as leasing agent. The mall underwent a myriad of changes soon afterward, including three anchor stores that all opened in October 2000: Bass Pro Shops opened in the former Parisian, Burlington Coat Factory replaced the former \\"Festival\\" wing, and Stein Mart entered Ohio with a temporary outlet store in the space previously occupied by Dawahares. Also joining the mall between 2000 and 2001 were Media Play, Off 5th (an outlet division of Saks Fifth Avenue), and the first Steve & Barry's sports clothing store in Ohio. These stores were part of a reconceptualization of the mall as \\"a value retail center with new-to-the- market merchants\\". Furthering this reconceptualization was the addition of new entertainment venues, including a nightclub called Metropolis, a new Showcase Cinemas theater complex with stadium seating, and a new children's playplace called Wonderpark. =200207: Cincinnati Mills= alt=A two-story concourse of a largely abandoned shopping mall, as seen from the upper level. Present is a sign reading \\"Neighborhood A, Neighborhood C, Food Court\\". Mills Corporation bought the mall from Gator Investments in September 2002 and announced that the mall would undergo further redevelopment, along with a name change to Cincinnati Mills. As part of the redevelopment, Mills forced many small independent businesses out of the property. Renovations began in January, which included new paint, floors, and signage throughout, along with differently-themed decor for each wing of the mall, typical of properties developed by Mills at the time. Elder-Beerman announced the closure of its store in 2003, as the chain wanted to focus on smaller stores in markets with lower populations. After a $70 million renovation project, the mall reopened officially as Cincinnati Mills in August 2004. As part of Mills' development, Babies \\"R\\" Us replaced Stein Mart, and Johnny's Toys had opened in the upper level of the former Elder-Beerman, while the older Super Saver theater was sold to the local theater chain Danbarry and renamed the Dollar Saver. Inline tenants at this point were focused mainly on discount stores and amenities suitable for families, as was typical of other properties developed by Mills. By January 2005, the mall had a 90 percent occupancy. Despite these renovations, the mall's tenancy began to slump again in 2006. This included the loss of Media Play, which went out of business entirely, and Johnny's Toys, which was closed so that Steve & Barry's could create a larger store using all of the former Elder-Beerman store. In addition, the president of Bigg's reported that their store in the mall had constantly struggled in sales due to it being located at the back of the property. Also contributing to the decline were continued competition with Northgate and Tri-County malls, along with a newer outdoor mall called Bridgewater Falls in nearby Hamilton; lower- class demographics surrounding the mall; shopper unfamiliarity with the specialty tenants within; bankruptcy filings of key tenants; and complications from an accounting scandal in which the Mills corporation was involved. Simon Property Group acquired the Mills portfolio in 2007. =2008present: Cincinnati Mall, Forest Fair Village= Shot of the desolate center court of Forest Fair Village Mall. Bigg's closed in June 2008, shortly after both Berean Christian Stores and Wonderpark closed. North Star Realty acquired the mall from Simon in January 2009. North Star proposed to begin converting portions of the mall to office space, call centers, or other non-retail uses, also renaming the property to Cincinnati Mall in March 2009. Under North Star's ownership, Steve & Barry's vacated due to the chain going out of business, while Off 5th, Guess, Lane Bryant, and Dress Barn relocated to a newly built outlet mall in Monroe. Despite the loss of these stores and other inline tenants such as MasterCuts and GNC, Totes Isotoner operated a temporary warehouse store in a vacated retail slot near the food court. In addition, the property owners had fallen delinquent on property taxes. Cincinnati Holding Company purchased the mall in 2010, right as Showcase Cinemas closed.Nautical- themed food court, May 2018. In 2011, three local businessmen announced plans to open ice rinks in the vacated Bigg's. By this point, Guitar Center had also closed, and a studio was proposed for its space, while a hotel was slated for the former Elder-Beerman/Steve & Barry's space. Bass Pro Shops announced plans to relocate to West Chester Township in 2013. By this point, the mall was once again renamed, to Forest Fair Village. In addition, a new arcade and gymnasium had opened. Also, Burlington Coat Factory moved out of the mall in 2013, and Danbarry Dollar Saver closed in 2014. The proposed relocation of Bass Pro Shops, combined with the continued delinquent taxes, created delays in any further attempts at redevelopment. Further redevelopment plans through association with Prudential Commercial Real Estate fell through in 2014 when that company's listing agreement expired. By 2017, only Kohl's, Bass Pro Shops, an arcade, and a children's entertainment complex remained in operation. A brokerage team put the mall up for sale in 2017. In mid-2017, a Christian media company had expressed interest in using part of the mall property for a studio.. On August 28, 2020, Kohl's announced that the location would relocate by March of 2021 which will leave Bass Pro Shops as the only anchor left.

Sillery was one of multiple self-governing municipalities amalgamated into a vastly expanded Quebec City, that went into legal effect on January 1, 2002, as part of the province-wide 2000‚Äì06 municipal reorganization in Quebec. Located alongside in what pre-merger was the southwestern border of Quebec City, Sillery is a constituent district () of the borough () of Sainte- Foy‚ÄìSillery‚ÄìCap-Rouge. The territorially expanded City of Quebec consists of six boroughs. Four heritage sites are located within Quebec City, one of which is situated in Sillery. The neighborhood of Sillery contains the Sillery Heritage Site, which was recognized as heritage district by the provincial government on 5 February 1964. On , the federal government's Parks Canada included Sillery's historic district on its Canadian Register of Historic Places. In 2013, Quebec City changed the name of the historic district to Sillery Heritage Site (), as part of its preparation for the provincial government's transfer of responsibility for the district's management to it. The City of Quebec has 27 neighborhood councils () spread across its territorial jurisdiction. Sillery has city representation and citizen participation through le conseil de quartier de Sillery. The council has public meetings, at Sillery's community centre, which on average are scheduled once a month. Sillery elects a total of 10 board members in staggered terms of office holding.  History  Sillery was named for No√´l Br√ªlart de Sillery (1577‚Äì1640), Knight of Malta. A wealthy and successful French diplomat, he renounced worldly goods and became a Catholic priest. He provided the funds for the establishment in of a settlement for First Nations converts to Catholicism. The community was Canada's first Indian reserve, established at a cove where the Algonquin fished for eels. Originally named in honour of Saint Joseph, the settlement became the home of up to 40 Algonquin Christian families, who lived there most of the year, excluding the hunting season. Missionaries to New France, such as Jacques Gravier, studied with the indigenous residents of Sillery to learn their languages before going to more distant settlements. By the early 18th century, he had compiled a nearly 600‚Äìpage dictionary of Kaskaskia Illinois‚ÄìFrench. Many of the community's natives fell victim to epidemics of new infectious diseases, to which they had no natural immunity. The settlement was largely depopulated by the late 1680s. Renamed Sillery in honour of its financier, the town later became important as a port for the lumber industry. The city of Sillery's motto was non multa sed multum, the Latin proverb of \\"not many things, but much,\\" a fit descriptor for the small enclave. From the land at the water's edge, including Anse-au- Foulon, site of the disembarkation of General Wolfe's successful army in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the community spread up to the top of the heights overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. In 1760, during the French and Indian War, the Battle of Sainte-Foy was fought near Sillery, as part of a French attempt to re-capture Quebec City, which had been taken by the British the previous year. Sillery houses Bois-de-Coulonge Park, once the viceregal residence of Quebec. A villa known as Spencer Wood was built in 1854 by the government of the Province of Canada, and was purchased by the Quebec Government in 1870 to serve as the residence of Quebec's Lieutenant-Governors until 1966, when a major fire destroyed the main residence. Originally an estate () named in honour of the assassinated United Kingdom Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, in 1815, by his nephew, Michael Henry Perceval, it was renamed Bois-de-Coulonge in 1950. Commanding the bluffs just west of the city of Qu√©bec, in modern times Sillery was known principally for its quiet tree- lined streets, historic churches such as Saint-Michel de Sillery Church, views of the river, and several very old schools run by a variety of religious institutes. Its coat of arms consisted of a red shield with a white Maltese cross in the upper right hand corner and a three-masted ship in the lower left.  Profile  Commercial Maguire Street (avenue Maguire) On January 1, 2002, as part of a legislated amalgamation of cities across Quebec, Sillery ceased to exist as an independent municipality. Its territory became a part of the Sainte-Foy‚ÄîSillery‚ÄîCap-Rouge Borough of Qu√©bec. Of the former municipalities that now comprise Qu√©bec, Sillery was relatively linguistically diverse. In 2006, % of its population had at least English for mother tongue, and % for languages other than French or English, while for the census metropolitan area of Quebec City, it was respectively % and %. Sillery is also known as one of the most affluent area of Quebec City, as residential properties sold on average for in 2017, and where live a number of professors of nearby Laval University. Nonetheless, there is still a pocket of modest and small apartment buildings. According to the statistics agency of Quebec, in 2001 the average income of Sillery households was , and 58% of them earned more than per year (in both case the highest figure in the Capitale-Nationale region.) In 2012, the personal average income was , still the highest in the Quebec City region.  2006 Census data  The city of Sillery was dissolved in 2002, but Statistics Canada still provided information up to the Census of 2006: *Population: (-% change since 2001) *Number of private dwellings: *Average household size : persons *Median household income (for 2005): *Percentage of Canadian citizens: % *Percentage of visible minority: 5% *Population over 15 years of age without a certificate, diploma or degree: % *Area: km¬≤ *Density: persons per km¬≤  2016 Sociodemographic and economic profile  In January 2019, the City of Qu√©bec published a longitudinal sociodemographic () and economic profile of Sillery, utilizing Statistics Canada's census data for the years 1996, 2006, and 2016. *Population: (-% change since 1996) *Number of private dwellings: *Average household size : persons *Median household income (for 2015): *Percentage of Canadian citizens: % *Population over 15 years of age without a certificate, diploma or degree: % Gallery See also * Bois-de-Coulonge Park ‚Äî former location of Government House * Saint-Michel de Sillery Church * Sillery Heritage Site * Mount Hermon Cemetery External links  * * References Category:1637 establishments in the French colonial empire Category:French mission settlements in North America Category:Neighbourhoods in Quebec City Category:First Nations history Category:Former municipalities in Quebec Category:Populated places disestablished in 2002 ","title":"Sillery, Quebec City"},{"id":"2423757","text":"John Sigsbee Rees Shad (1923-1994), served as chairman of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission between 1981 and 1987.

The airport is home to the Rajiv Gandhi Aviation Academy (RGAA), the Telangana State Aviation Academy and the Begumpet Air Force Station of the Indian Air Force. Begumpet used to be the only international airport of Hyderabad until the opening of Rajiv Gandhi International Airport on 23 March 2008, which ceased all civil operations. Final and last flight to take off was a Singapore Airlines flight at 23:40 on 22 March 2008.  History  Tata Airlines started as an air mail service from Karachi to Madras via Hyderabad Deccan A Jet Airways civilian aircraft parked at the airport Begumpet Airport was established in 1930 by Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, and Berar with the formation of Hyderabad Aero Club. Initially, it was used by the Nizam of the Hyderabad state as a domestic and international airport for the Nizam's Deccan Airways, one of the premier and the earliest airline in British India. The terminal building was created in 1937.Begumpet Airport History A new terminal building came up on the south side in 1972 and later became the main airport. The older terminal hitherto was referred to as \\"Old Airport\\" at Begumpet. The new terminal building consisted of two check-in terminals; Rajiv Gandhi International and NTR National with a common arrival module. At the time of its closure, Begumpet was the 6th busiest airport in India. It had 13 parking bays in operation around the terminal block and five \\"night parking bays\\" on the northern side next to the old block, sufficient to handle the A320 and Boeing 737. The airport had limited night landing facilities and only 30% of Andhra Pradesh's international traffic flowed through the airport due to the lack of direct flights. Begumpet Airport's capacity had reportedly been exceeded in both domestic and international areas due to the rate of growth in passenger traffic, estimated at 45% p.a., the highest among Indian airports. The airport handled 20 000 passengers daily with about 300 aircraft movements of 16 international and 10 domestic airlines. US President Bill Clinton's Air Force One landed and took off from Begumpet during his visit to Hyderabad in early 2000.

This biennial event, organised by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in collaboration with FICCI, was first held 15‚Äì18 October 2008. The second edition, India Aviation 2010, was organised from 37 March 2010. The partner country in the second edition was France, and the focus country for the event was the USA. The event was bigger in magnitude to its predecessor. More than 200 exhibitors participated and the exhibition covered a gross area of . 40 aircraft participated, including the Antonov An-148 which was on display for first time in India. More than 500 conference delegates and more than 5000 Business visitors attended the event. Parallel events of International Conference on Civil Aviation and CEOs Forum were also organized. The third edition, India Aviation 2012, was organised in Hyderabad from 1418 March 2012.  General aviation and training  After the closure of Begumpet Airport for commercial flights, it is being used for aviation and flight training purposes by Telangana Aviation Academy, Asia Pacific Flight Training Academy Ltd., and Rajiv Gandhi Aviation Academy.

A norm of reaction is a graph that shows the relationship between genes and environmental factors when phenotypic differences are continuous. They can help illustrate GxE interactions. When the norm of reaction is not parallel, as shown in the figure below, there is a gene by environment interaction. This indicates that each genotype responds to environmental variation in a different way. Environmental variation can be physical, chemical, biological, behavior patterns or life events. This norm of reaction shows lines that are not parallel indicating a gene by environment interaction. Each genotype is responding to environmental variation in a different way. Gene‚Äìenvironment interactions are studied to gain a better understanding of various phenomena. In genetic epidemiology, gene‚Äìenvironment interactions are useful for understanding some diseases. Sometimes, sensitivity to environmental risk factors for a disease are inherited rather than the disease itself being inherited. Individuals with different genotypes are affected differently by exposure to the same environmental factors, and thus gene‚Äìenvironment interactions can result in different disease phenotypes. For example, sunlight exposure has a stronger influence on skin cancer risk in fair-skinned humans than in individuals with darker skin. These interactions are of particular interest to genetic epidemiologists for predicting disease rates and methods of prevention with respect to public health. The term is also used amongst developmental psychobiologists to better understand individual and evolutionary development. Nature versus nurture debates assume that variation in a trait is primarily due to either genetic differences or environmental differences. However, the current scientific opinion holds that neither genetic differences nor environmental differences are solely responsible for producing phenotypic variation, and that virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental differences.Ridley, M. (2003) Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, & What Makes Us Human. Harper Collins. Rutter, Michael. (2006) Genes and Behavior: Nature‚ÄìNurture Interplay Explained Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers Statistical analysis of the genetic and environmental differences contributing to the phenotype would have to be used to confirm these as gene‚Äìenvironment interactions. In developmental genetics, a causal interaction is enough to confirm gene‚Äìenvironment interactions.  History of the definition  The history of defining gene‚Äìenvironment interaction dates back to the 1930s and remains a topic of debate today. The first instance of debate occurred between Ronald Fisher and Lancelot Hogben. Fisher sought to eliminate interaction from statistical studies as it was a phenomenon that could be removed using a variation in scale. Hogben believed that the interaction should be investigated instead of eliminated as it provided information on the causation of certain elements of development. A similar argument faced multiple scientists in the 1970s. Arthur Jensen published the study ‚ÄúHow much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement?‚Äù, which amongst much criticism also faced contention by scientists Richard Lewontin and David Layzer. Lewontin and Layzer argued that in order to conclude causal mechanisms, the gene‚Äìenvironment interaction could not be ignored in the context of the study while Jensen defended that interaction was purely a statistical phenomenon and not related to development. Around the same time, Kenneth J. Rothman supported the use of a statistical definition for interaction while researchers Kupper and Hogan believed the definition and existence of interaction was dependent on the model being used. The most recent criticisms were spurred by Moffitt and Caspi's studies on 5-HTTLPR and stress and its influence on depression. In contrast to previous debates, Moffitt and Caspi were now using the statistical analysis to prove that interaction existed and could be used to uncover the mechanisms of a vulnerability trait. Contention came from Zammit, Owen and Lewis who reiterated the concerns of Fisher in that the statistical effect was not related to the developmental process and would not be replicable with a difference of scale.  Definitions  There are two different conceptions of gene‚Äìenvironment interaction today. Tabery has labeled them biometric and developmental interaction, while SesardicSesardic, N. (2005). Making sense of heritability. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 48. uses the terms statistical and commonsense interaction. The biometric (or statistical) conception has its origins in research programs that seek to measure the relative proportions of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation within populations. Biometric gene‚Äìenvironment interaction has particular currency in population genetics and behavioral genetics. Any interaction results in the breakdown of the additivity of the main effects of heredity and environment, but whether such interaction is present in particular settings is an empirical question. Biometric interaction is relevant in the context of research on individual differences rather than in the context of the development of a particular organism. Developmental gene‚Äìenvironment interaction is a concept more commonly used by developmental geneticists and developmental psychobiologists. Developmental interaction is not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical interaction is present or not, developmental interaction is in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.  Epidemiological models of GxE  In epidemiology, the following models can be used to group the different interactions between gene and environment. Model A describes a genotype that increases the level of expression of a risk factor but does not cause the disease itself. For example, the PKU gene results in higher levels of phenylalanine than normal which in turn causes mental retardation. The risk factor in Model B in contrast has a direct effect on disease susceptibility which is amplified by the genetic susceptibility. Model C depicts the inverse, where the genetic susceptibility directly effects disease while the risk factor amplifies this effect. In each independent situation, the factor directly effecting the disease can cause disease by itself. Model D differs as neither factor in this situation can effect disease risk, however, when both genetic susceptibility and risk factor are present the risk is increased. For example, the G6PD deficiency gene when combined with fava bean consumption results in hemolytic anemia. This disease does not arise in individuals that eat fava beans and lack G6PD deficiency nor in G6PD-deficient people who do not eat fava beans. Lastly, Model E depicts a scenario where the environmental risk factor and genetic susceptibility can individually both influence disease risk. When combined, however, the effect on disease risk differs. The models are limited by the fact that the variables are binary and so do not consider polygenic or continuous scale variable scenarios.  Methods of analysis  = Traditional genetic designs =  Adoption studies  Adoption studies have been used to investigate how similar individuals that have been adopted are to their biological parents with whom they did not share the same environment with. Additionally, adopted individuals are compared to their adoptive family due to the difference in genes but shared environment. For example, an adoption study showed that Swedish men with disadvantaged adoptive environments and a genetic predisposition were more likely to abuse alcohol.  Twin studies  Using monozygotic twins, the effects of different environments on identical genotypes could be observed. Later studies leverage biometrical modelling techniques to include the comparisons of dizygotic twins to ultimately determine the different levels of gene expression in different environments.  Family studies  Family-based research focuses on the comparison of low-risk controls to high risk children to determine the environmental effect on subjects with different levels of genetic risk. For example, a Danish study on high-risk children with schizophrenic mothers depicted that children without a stable caregiver were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. = Molecular analyses =  Interaction with single genes  The often used method to detect gene‚Äìenvironment interactions is by studying the effect a single gene variation (candidate gene) has with respect to a particular environment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) are compared with single binary exposure factors to determine any effects. Candidate studies such as these require strong biological hypotheses which are currently difficult to select given the little understanding of biological mechanisms that lead to higher risk. These studies are also often difficult to replicate commonly due to small sample sizes which typically results in disputed results. The polygenic nature of complex phenotypes suggests single candidate studies could be ineffective in determining the various smaller scale effects from the large number of influencing gene variants.  Interaction with multiple genes  Since the same environmental factor could interact with multiple genes, a polygenic approach can be taken to analyze GxE interactions. A polygenic score is generated using the alleles associated with a trait and their respective weights based on effect and examined in combination with environmental exposure. Though this method of research is still early, it is consistent with psychiatric disorders. As a result of the overlap of endophenotypes amongst disorders this suggests that the outcomes of gene‚Äìenvironment interactions are applicable across various diagnoses.  Genome-wide association studies and genome wide interaction studies  A genome wide interaction scan (GEWIS) approach examines the interaction between the environment and a large number of independent SNP's. An effective approach to this all-encompassing study occurs in two-steps where the genome is first filtered using gene-level tests and pathway based gene set analyses. The second step uses the SNP's with G‚ÄìE association and tests for interaction. The differential susceptibility hypothesis has been reaffirmed through genome wide approaches.  Controversies  = Lack of replication = A particular concern with gene‚Äìenvironment interaction studies is the lack of reproducibility. Specifically complex traits studies have come under scrutiny for producing results that cannot be replicated. For example, studies of the 5-HTTLPR gene and stress resulting in modified risk of depression have had conflicting results. A possible explanation behind the inconsistent results is the heavy use of multiple testing. Studies are suggested to produce inaccurate results due to the investigation of multiple phenotypes and environmental factors in individual experiments. = Additive vs multiplicative model = There are two different models for the scale of measurement that helps determine if gene‚Äìenvironment interaction exists in a statistical context. There is disagreement on which scale should be used. Under these analyses, if the combined variables fit either model then there is no interaction. The combined effects must either be greater for synergistic or less than for an antagonistic outcome. The additive model measures risk differences while the multiplicative model uses ratios to measure effects. The additive model has been suggested to be a better fit for predicting disease risk in a population while a multiplicative model is more appropriate for disease etiology. Epigenetics is an example of an underlying mechanism of gene‚Äìenvironment effects, however, it does not conclude whether environment effects are additive, multiplicative or interactive.  Gene \\"√ó\\" environment \\"√ó\\" environment interactions  New studies have also revealed the interactive effect of multiple environment factors. For example, a child with a poor quality environment would be more sensitive to a poor environment as an adult which ultimately led to higher psychological distress scores. This depicts a three way interaction Gene x Environment x Environment. The same study suggests taking a life course approach to determining genetic sensitivity to environmental influences within the scope of mental illnesses. Medical significance Doctors are interested in knowing whether disease can be prevented by reducing exposure to environmental risks. Some people carry genetic factors that confer susceptibility or resistance to a certain disorder in a particular environment. The interaction between the genetic factors and environmental stimulus is what results in the disease phenotype. There may be significant public health benefits in using gene by environment interactions to prevent or cure disease. An individual's response to a drug can result from various gene by environment interactions. Therefore, the clinical importance of pharmacogenetics and gene by environment interactions comes from the possibility that genomic, along with environmental information, will allow more accurate predictions of an individual's drug response. This would allow doctors to more precisely select a certain drug and dosage to achieve therapeutic response in a patient while minimizing side effects and adverse drug reactions. This information could also help to prevent the health care costs associated with adverse drug reactions and inconveniently prescribing drugs to patients who likely won't respond to them. In a similar manner, an individual can respond to other environmental stimuli, factors or challenges differently according to specific genetic differences or alleles. These other factors include the diet and specific nutrients within the diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use, sleep (bed time, duration), and any of a number of exposures (or exposome), including toxins, pollutants, sunlight (latitude north‚Äìsouth of the equator), among any number of others. The diet, for example, is modifiable and has significant impact on a host of cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the clinic, typically assessed risks of these conditions include blood lipids (triglyceride, and HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), glycemic traits (plasma glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, beta cell function as HOMA-BC), obesity anthropometrics (BMI/obesity, adiposity, body weight, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio), vascular measures (diastolic and systolic blood pressure), and biomarkers of inflammation. Gene‚Äìenvironment interactions can modulate the adverse effects of an allele that confers increased risk of disease, or can exacerbate the genotype‚Äìphenotype relationship and increase risk, in a manner often referred to as nutrigenetics. A catalog of genetic variants that associate with these and related cardiometabolic phenotypes and modified by common environmental factors is available. Conversely, a disease study using breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis shows that including GxE interactions in a risk prediction model does not improve risk identification.  Examples  Mean bristle number by ¬∞C # In Drosophila: A classic example of gene‚Äìenvironment interaction was performed on Drosophila by Gupta and Lewontin in 1981. In their experiment they demonstrated that the mean bristle number on Drosophila could vary with changing temperatures. As seen in the graph to the right, different genotypes reacted differently to the changing environment. Each line represents a given genotype, and the slope of the line reflects the changing phenotype (bristle number) with changing temperature. Some individuals had an increase in bristle number with increasing temperature while others had a sharp decrease in bristle number with increasing temperature. This showed that the norms of reaction were not parallel for these flies, proving that gene‚Äìenvironment interactions exist. # In plants: One very interesting approach about genotype by environment interaction strategies is its use in the selection of sugarcane cultivars adapted to different environments. In this article, they analyzed twenty sugarcane genotypes grown in eight different locations over two crop cycles to identify mega-environments related to higher cane yield, measured in tons of cane per hectare (TCH) and percentage of sucrose (Pol% cane) using biplot multivariate GEI models. The authors then created a novel strategy to study both yield variables in a two-way coupled strategy even though the results showed a mean negative correlation. Through coinertia analysis, it was possible to determine the best-fitted genotypes for both yield variables in all environments. The use of these novel strategies like coinertia in GEI, proved to be a great complement analysis to AMMI and GGE, especially when the yield improvement implies multiple yield variables. Seven genetically distinct yarrow plants were collected and three cuttings taken from each plant. One cutting of each genotype was planted at low, medium, and high elevations, respectively. When the plants matured, no one genotype grew best at all altitudes, and at each altitude the seven genotypes fared differently. For example, one genotype grew the tallest at the medium elevation but attained only middling height at the other two elevations. The best growers at low and high elevation grew poorly at medium elevation. The medium altitude produced the worst overall results, but still yielded one tall and two medium-tall samples. Altitude had an effect on each genotype, but not to the same degree nor in the same way. A sorghum bi-parental population was repeatedly grown in seven diverse geographic locations across years. A group of genotypes requires similar growing degree-day (GDD) to flower across all environments, while another group of genotypes need less GDD in certain environments, but higher GDD in different environments to flower. The complex flowering time patterns is attributed to the interaction of major flowering time genes (Ma1, Ma6, FT, ELF3) and an explicit environmental factor, photothermal time (PTT) capturing the interaction between temperature and photoperiod. # Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a human genetic condition caused by mutations to a gene coding for a particular liver enzyme. In the absence of this enzyme, an amino acid known as phenylalanine does not get converted into the next amino acid in a biochemical pathway, and therefore too much phenylalanine passes into the blood and other tissues. This disturbs brain development leading to mental retardation and other problems. PKU affects approximately 1 out of every 15,000 infants in the U.S. However, most affected infants do not grow up impaired because of a standard screening program used in the U.S. and other industrialized societies. Newborns found to have high levels of phenylalanine in their blood can be put on a special, phenylalanine-free diet. If they are put on this diet right away and stay on it, these children avoid the severe effects of PKU. This example shows that a change in environment (lowering Phenylalanine consumption) can affect the phenotype of a particular trait, demonstrating a gene‚Äìenvironment interaction. # A single nucleotide polymorphism rs1800566 in NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) alters the risk of asthma and general lung injury upon interaction with NOx pollutants, in individuals with this mutation. # A functional polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene promoter can moderate the association between early life trauma and increased risk for violence and antisocial behavior. Low MAOA activity is a significant risk factor for aggressive and antisocial behavior in adults who report victimization as children. Persons who were abused as children but have a genotype conferring high levels of MAOA expression are less likely to develop symptoms of antisocial behavior. These findings must be interpreted with caution, however, because gene association studies on complex traits are notorious for being very difficult to confirm. #In Drosophila eggs: Egg Development Time by TemperatureContrary to the aforementioned examples, length of egg development in Drosophila as a function of temperature demonstrates the lack of gene‚Äìenvironment interactions. The attached graph shows parallel reaction norms for a variety of individual Drosophila flies, showing that there is not a gene‚Äìenvironment interaction present between the two variables. In other words, each genotype responds similarly to the changing environment producing similar phenotypes. For all individual genotypes, average egg development time decreases with increasing temperature. The environment is influencing each of the genotypes in the same predictable manner.

Distribution Barnyard grass commonly occurs throughout tropical Asia and Africa in fields and along roadsides, ditches, along railway lines, and in disturbed areas such as gravel pits and dumps. It also invades riverbanks and the shores of lakes and ponds. It occurs in all agricultural regions. This species is considered an invasive species in North America where it occurs throughout the continental United States. It is also found in southern Canada from British Columbia east to Newfoundland.http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Echinochloa+crusgalli Map showing distribution It was first spotted in the Great Lakes region in 1843. Ecology Ranging from Boreal Moist to Wet through Tropical Very Dry to Moist forest life zones. Adapted to nearly all types of wet places, this grass is often a common weed in paddy fields, roadsides, cultivated areas, and fallow fields. It grows on variety of wet sites such as ditches, low areas in fertile croplands and wet wastes, often growing in water. Succeeds in cool regions, but better adapted to areas where average annual temperature is 14‚Äì16 ¬∞C. Not restricted by soil pH. Usage A warm-season grass used as cattle fodder and is sometimes cultivated for this purpose. It is also suited for silage, but not for hay. It is fed green to animals and provides fodder throughout the year; hay made from this plant can be kept up to 6 years. This grass is also used for reclamation of saline and alkaline areas, especially in Egypt. This grass is readily eaten by wild animals: rabbits, deer, waterfowls, etc. The grain of some varieties is eaten by humans in times of scarcity and sometimes used for adulterating fennel.http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Echinochloa_crusgalli.html. The roots are boiled to cure indigestion in the Philippines. The young shoots are eaten as a vegetable. The plant extract is used in diseases of the spleen. Young shoots are eaten as a vegetable in Java. Reported to be preventative and tonic, barnyard grass is a folk remedy in India for carbuncles, haemorrhages, sores, spleen trouble, cancer and wounds. In the Hisar district of the Indian state of Haryana the seeds of this grass are commonly eaten with cultivated rice grains to make rice pudding or khir on Hindu fast days. Barnyard grass was one of the five most cultivated crops during Joseon Dynasty in Korea. Rural Development Administration of South Korean government discovered barnyard grass effectively lowers blood sugar and cholesterol when consumed, according to Yonhap.

From the 1880 New York edition. The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses is an 18th- or 19th-century magical text allegedly written by Moses, and passed down as hidden (or lost) books of the Hebrew Bible. Self-described as \\"the wonderful arts of the old Hebrews, taken from the Mosaic books of the Kabbalah and the Talmud,\\" it is actually a grimoire, or text of magical incantations and seals, that purports to instruct the reader in the spells used to create some of the miracles portrayed in the Bible as well as to grant other forms of good fortune and good health. The work contains reputed Talmudic magic names, words, and ideograms, some written in Hebrew and some with letters from the Latin alphabet. It contains \\"Seals\\" or magical drawings accompanied by instructions intended to help the user perform various tasks, from controlling weather or people to contacting the dead or Biblical religious figures. Copies have been traced to 18th-century German pamphlets, but an 1849 printing, aided by the appearance of the popular press in the 19th century, spread the text through Germany and Northern Europe to German Americans and eventually helped popularize the texts among African Americans in the United States, the Caribbean, and Anglophone West Africa. It influenced European Occult Spiritualism as well as African American hoodoo folk magic, and magical- spiritual practices in the Caribbean, and West Africa.Owen Davies. Owen Davies's top 10 grimoires. The Guardian. 8 April 2009. An older magical text, a fourth-century Greek papyrus entitled Eighth Book of Moses otherwise unrelated to the Sixth and Seventh Books, was found in Thebes in the 19th century and published as part of the Greek Magical Papyri. History No first version of this work has been established, but early versions began to appear as inexpensive pamphlets in Germany in the 18th century. Elements of the \\"Seventh Book\\", such as ‚ÄúThe Seven Semiphoras of Adam‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Seven Semiphoras of Moses‚Äù appear to have come from the seventh book of the earlier European copies of the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh.Don Karr. The Study of Solomonic Magic in English, (2009). The work came to wide prominence when published as volume 6 of Das Kloster in 1849 in Stuttgart by antiquarian Johann Scheible. Historian Owen Davies traces copies of the work from the 18th century in Germany. After circulating there, the work was popularized in the United States first in the communities of the Pennsylvania Dutch. =Anglo-Germanic American rural folk magic= In the early 19th-century European or European- American grimoires were popular among immigrants and in rural communities where the folk traditions of Europe, intertwined with European religious mysticism, survived. One of the earliest American grimoires is John George Hohman's Pow-Wows; or, Long Lost Friend, a collection of magical spells originally published in 1820 for Pennsylvania Dutch spiritualists known as \\"hexmeisters\\".Hohman, John George. 1820. Pow-wow's: or, Long Lost Friend. 1971 reprint edition. Pomeroy: Health Research Books. While versions of The Sixth and Seventh Books were likely passed around German immigrant communities from the late 18th century, the 1849 Leipzig copy was followed by a New York printing, in German, in 1865, and an English translation in 1880. The growth of inexpensive paperback publication in the 19th century, like those of Chicago occult publisher L. W. de Laurence, helped the work gain popularity outside German communities.

One story in this work was collected in 1962. Richard M. Dorson. Buying the Wind: Regional Folklore in the United States. University of Chicago Press, (1972) =African American folk magic and spirituality= The boom in inexpensive publishing, and the interest in Spiritualism helped the work gain popularity in the African American population of the United States, and from there, the Anglophone parts of the Caribbean. From 1936 through 1972, the folklorist Harry Middleton Hyatt interviewed 1,600 African American Christian root doctors and home practitioners of hoodoo, and many of them made reference to using this book and other seal-bearing grimoires of the era, such as the Key of Solomon. When Hyatt asked his informants where such books were purchased, he was told that they could be had by mail order from hoodoo suppliers in Chicago, Memphis, or Baltimore.Hyatt, Harry Middleton. Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork. [Five Vols.] Memoirs of the Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation, 1970-1978. In the West Indies, the book became one of the central texts of Jamaican obeah and was counted among the founding works of the \\"Zion Revivalist\\" Christian movement and the Rastafari movement of the early 20th century. The influential Jamaican musical group Toots and the Maytals, for instance, released in 1963 the song \\"Six And Seven Books Of Moses\\": its lyrics list the accepted books of the Old Testament, ending in \\"...the Sixth and the Seventh books, they wrote them all.\\"Maytals.net:lyrics.

Accessed 2009-04-08. =Folk magic and spirituality in Anglophone West Africa= In early 20th-century British West Africa and Liberia, The Sixth and Seventh Books was adopted widely. It served as a source for \\"Christian Magic\\", both by West African spiritualist Christian cults and \\"assimilated\\" Africans. In colonial Gold Coast and Nigeria, it was seen as a \\"western\\" form of magic that might be used by educated Africans seeking access to Britain or its power, much like Masonic ritual or Rosicrucianism. The Nigerian press in the 1920s regularly featured advertisements for copies of The Sixth and Seventh Books and other Christian occult books.Elizabeth Allo Isichei. A history of Christianity in Africa: from antiquity to the present. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, (1995) p. 295. It was also influential in Christian occult movements in Anglophone West Africa. and West African religious movements which blended Christianity and traditional magic made use of the work. Josiah Olunowo Ositelu's seals and mystical written incantations, used in the Nigerian Church of the Lord (Aladura) were likely derived from the Sixth and Seventh Books. =Elsewhere= Versions of this work circulated throughout Scandinavia and Central Europe. In Sweden and Finland these books are compiled and published under the titles Den Svarta Bibeln and Musta Raamattu, respectively, meaning \\"The Black Bible\\". Contents The printed texts of The Sixth and Seven Books of Moses (from 1849) combine two purportedly lost short Biblical texts with several contemporary essays and half a dozen purported writings of those who kept this knowledge and practiced its use through history, dated from Biblical times to the 17th Century. These works attempt to paint a portrait of secret knowledge which Moses was given by God, and then handed down father to son until King Solomon, when it was handed to Priests, and finally, Talmudic scholars. In Christian circles, the text appealed to the same authority as did Biblical apocrypha: Biblical texts outside the current Biblical canon. Containing numerous allegedly magical spells used to summon spirits to do the will of the conjurer, the books are attributed to works in which Moses sets forth the magic which enabled him to defeat the magicians of Egypt, part the Red Sea, and perform the acts attributed to him in the Old Testament.Brian M. Britt. Rewriting Moses: the narrative eclipse of the text.Continuum International Publishing Group, (2004) Although these are allegedly Kabbalistic in nature, there is very little or no influence of Kabbala within the pages. Most texts are reputed to be Hebrew, passed to the editors through European Talmudic scholars or Christian Medieval ecclesiastics who were privy to secret Biblical texts. Some of the texts are allegedly translated from a text written by Canaanite magicians and keepers of the Samaritan Pentateuch in the \\"Cuthan-Samaritan language\\", a language considered extinct since the 12th century. No complete manuscripts older than Scheible's 1849 printing are extant, and the claimed origin must be regarded pseudepigraphic and spurious. It is rather of a school of European Medieval and Enlightenment grimoires, such as The Key of Solomon, The Red Dragon, Petit Albert and others. Elements appear directly reprinted from Three Books of Occult Philosophy by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1531) and an 18th-century German translation by Gottfried Selig of the Hebrew Sepher Schimmush Tehillim (the magical uses of the Psalms).Joseph H. Peterson. The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses: Online digital edition (2005‚Äì2006) esotericarchives.com. Accessed 2009-04-08. The vast majority of the printed works of 1849, a New York German printing of 1865, and the first English public printing of 1880 are additions to the reputed biblical books. In the 1880 edition, for instance, \\"the Sixth Book of Moses\\" and \\"the Seventh Book of Moses\\" run only from page 6 to 28, making up 23 of the 190 pages. The vast majority of the work is appendices, restatements of similar seals and incantations, reputedly from those Kabala teachers to whom this knowledge was passed. Finally, there are sections including lists of the powers associated with each of the Hebrew \\"Names of God\\", the powers and use of reciting each of the Psalms and each Hebrew letter.See the 1880 English translation of the Johann Scheible version, originally from the Harry Houdini Collection at the Library of Congress available as: \\"The sixth and seventh books of Moses:. Accessed 2009-04-08. =Introduction= Scheible also inserted an introduction, \\"The Magic of the Israelites\\", taken from Joseph Ennemoser's 1844 Geschichte der Magie. The introduction to the 1880 New York edition explains the genesis of the books: =The Sixth Book of Moses= The Sixth Book includes an introduction along with seven chapters, known as \\"The Mystery of the First Seal\\" through \\"The Mystery of the Seventh Seal\\". The included pictures of the \\"seals\\" consist of various stylized symbols surrounded pseudo-Hebrew and pseudo-Latin phrases and letters. Each \\"Seal\\" or \\"Table\\" (in the Seventh Book) is paired with an incantation (reputedly Hebrew) and a very brief description of its powers. =The Seventh Book of Moses= The seventh book is much the same: taking the events of the Biblical narrative of Moses' life (and other Biblical and unknown stories) and gives a reputed pairing of an incantation and a drawn magical object, here called \\"Tables\\". There are twelve tables, each said to control powers associated with certain Angels, elements, or astronomical symbols: #The First Table of the Spirits of the Air; #The Second Table of the Spirits of Fire; #The Third Table of the Spirits of Water; #The Fourth Table of the Spirits of the Earth; #The Fifth Table of Saturn; #The Sixth Table of Jupiter; #The Seventh Table of Mars; #The Eighth Table of the Sun; #The Ninth Table of Venus; #The a)Tenth Table of Mercury; #The Eleventh Table of the Spirits; #The Twelfth Table of the Schemhamforasch; =The remainder of Volume I= In the New York Edition this is followed by \\"The Magic of the Israelites\\", used in the 1849 version as the introduction. =Volume II= The second volume of the work collects a series of works claimed to be \\"in the tradition of\\" the original two books. In the New York edition, this begins with \\"Formulas of the Magical Kabala of the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses\\", which again demonstrates seals and incantations, these said to be the Magic used by Moses himself at various points in the Biblical stories, such as how to turn his staff into a snake or conjure the pillar of fire. They include other incantations, such as the one labeled \\"These words are terrible, and will assemble devils or spirits, or they will cause the dead to appear.\\" This is followed by works of only a dozen or so pages, all giving similar \\"Seals\\" and incantations (often with identical titles, such as \\"the Breastplate of Moses\\") These include \\"Extract From The True Clavicula Of Solomon And Of The Girdle Of Aaron\\" (a version of the Key of Solomon grimoire), the \\"Biblia Arcana Magica Alexander, According To The Tradition Of The Sixth And Seventh Books Of Moses, Besides Magical Laws\\", and the \\"Citation of the Seven Great Princes in The Tradition Of The Sixth And Seventh Books Of Moses\\" which contains similar seals and incantations with more or less Biblical connotations. =Names and psalms= These are followed by a long section reputing to explain the powers associated with each of the Hebrew \\"Names of God\\", other seals which are to be used with these incantations, the Schemhamphoras of King Solomon (The Semiphoras and Schemhamphorash a 1686 occult book attributed to King Solomon printed by Andreas Luppius), and the powers and use of reciting each of the Psalms and each Hebrew letter. For example: =Astrology, cures, and amulets= Finally there are sections \\"ASTROLOGICAL INFLUENCE UPON MAN AND MAGICAL CURES OF THE OLD HEBREWS. From Dr. Gideon Brechee's work: The Transcendental, Magic and Magical Healing Art in the Talmud. Vienna: 1850\\". This is a likely bowdlerizing of Gideon Brecher's Das Transcendetale, Magie, und Magische Heilertarten im Talmud (Vienna Klopf und Eurich, 1850).

An exemplary edition of the whole Miscellanea Antarctica was published by San Marcos University (Peru) in 1951, supplanting previous partial editions.

As the name implies, it is designed to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a tension device to a plate or by using a special dynamic compression plate. However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the tension device and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft. When plates are used, atrophy of the bone beneath the plate may predispose the bone to fracture. After removal of plates, fractures may occur through the screw holes. Sliding screw plate The sliding screw plate (dynamic compression screw, dynamic hip screw) may be used to treat intertrochanteric fractures as well as other injuries. This device consists of a lag screw and a side plate with a barrel. The sliding screw telescopes and provides fixation while allowing impaction to occur at the fracture during healing and weight bearing. Among the complications of sliding screw plate fixation are \\"cutting out\\" of the nail, penetration of the screw into the joint, bending or breaking of the nail, and disengagement of the screw from the barrel and even protrusion of the screw into the vertebrae.

It is now part of the Borough of L'√éle- Bizard‚ÄìSainte-Genevi√®ve in the City of Montreal, created on January 1, 2002. The municipality, a small village populated by traditional Quebec-style dwellings and colonial mansions, is located on the north-west shore of the Island of Montreal along Gouin Boulevard, overlooking the Rivi√®re des Prairies and across from √éle Bizard located to the north. It is surrounded by the former municipality of Pierrefonds to the west, south and east. The C√©gep G√©rald-Godin and the √âglise Sainte-Genevi√®ve, built in 1844 and designed by renowned Quebec architect Thomas Baillarg√©, are located here. History Ch√¢teau Pierrefonds built by Joseph-Adolphe Chauret in 1902. Rebuilt in February 1993 after it burned down. Renovations in 2013 added extensions keeping the same style. = Catholic Parish = The signing of the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701 allowed the French habitants to colonize the western part of the Island of Montreal. In 1720 a road was built, and the Sulpicians mapped out the area. In 1739 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec approved the establishment of a canonical parish dedicated to Saint Genevi√®ve. The following year a chapel was completed. The first church was built in 1751. Antoine Faucon, father of Saint-Sulpice, participated in the construction of the village's first church. The present building dates from the years 1843 to 1847. = Civil Parish = The establishment of the civil parish of Sainte- Genevi√®ve, which was named after the church, occurred in 1845. On June 9, 1859, it was recognized as the Municipality of the Village of Sainte- Genevi√®ve. In 1893, it was connected to √éle Bizard across the Rivi√®re des Prairies by one of the Jacques Bizard Bridges, which replaced a ferry. = Division Into Municipalities = When the Paroisse de Ste Genevieve was established, Sainte-Genevi√®ve included the territory of the city of Roxboro and Pierrefonds. The formerly separate municipalities were merged into the city of Montreal on January 1, 2002 following municipal mergers organized by the provincial government at the time. Sainte-Genevi√®ve's territory also included the city of Dollard-des-Ormeaux, which also was briefly part of Montreal Urban Community, from 2002 until its demerger on January 1, 2006. Several successive divisions reduced the size of the town of Sainte-Genevi√®ve significantly. In 1904, Sainte-Genevi√®ve-de-Pierrefonds became independent from Sainte-Genevi√®ve, Roxboro in 1914, followed in 1924 by Dollard-des- Ormeaux. At the heart of the conflict that led to the separation of Sainte- Genevi√®ve was the famous lawyer Joseph-Adolphe Chauret, who in 1902 built a stately home reminiscent of homes in Pierrefonds, France, in the Department of Oise. He called his thatched house the \\"Ch√¢teau Pierrefonds.\\" In 1935, the two villages of Sainte-Genevi√®ve and Sainte-Genevi√®ve-de-Pierrefonds were merged and became once again the village of Sainte-Genevi√®ve. The name of Pierrefonds then disappeared until its reappearance in 1958, the founding date of the former city of Pierrefonds. In 1959, the Village of Sainte-Genevi√®ve was recognized as Ville Sainte-Genevi√®ve. = Amalgamation Into City of Montreal = On January 1, 2002 Ville Sainte-Genevi√®ve was merged into the City of Montreal borough of \\"L'√éle-Bizard‚ÄìSainte-Genevi√®ve\\".

The entire canal is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Opened in 1907, the canal was soon abandoned because of railroad competition. It was resurrected in the late 20th century as a recreational waterway. Its former name was the Illinois and Mississippi Canal. The main canal length is , and its feeder canal is long. The state park spans five counties (Rock Island, Bureau, Henry, Lee and Whiteside) and is long. History The Hennepin Canal was first conceived in 1834 as a connection between the Illinois and Mississippi River, but financial problems in the state delayed many public works projects. Pressure for transportation that was cheaper than rail convinced Congress to authorize preliminary surveys on the project in 1871. Construction began in 1892 and the first boat went through in 1907, reducing the distance by barge from Chicago to Rock Island by . While the canal was under construction, however, the Corps of Engineers undertook a widening of the locks on both the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. The new locks on those rivers were twenty and forty feet wider than the canal locks, making them obsolete before their initial use. In the 1930s the Hennepin Canal was used primarily for recreational traffic. The Hennepin Canal was open to boat traffic until 1951 at no cost. Ice made from the canal's frozen waters was sold during the winters to help pay the canal's maintenance costs. The Hennepin was the first American canal built of concrete without stone cut facings. Although the Hennepin enjoyed only limited success as a waterway, engineering innovations used in its construction were a bonus to the construction industry. The canal was used as a training ground for engineers who later worked on the Panama Canal. Both the Hennepin and Panama Canals used concrete lock chambers and both used a feeder canal from a man made lake to water the canals because both needed water to flow uphill. There are 33 locks on the canal. All are now visible, but the first one, on the Illinois River, had been under water from the 1930s until recent times. Lock #1 is only accessible on foot during the winter months; thick vegetation, the lack of a maintained towpath, and nearby private property prevent access during the summer. Fourteen of the locks had Marshall gates, which are unique to the Hennepin, and were raised and lowered on a horizontal axis. Five of the locks have been restored to working condition, although they are not used. One of these is a Marshall Gate lock. All of the gates from the remaining locks have been replaced with concrete walls, creating a series of waterfalls. The Hennepin originally had nine aqueducts - concrete troughs which carried the canal and its traffic across larger rivers and streams. Six of the aqueducts remain while the other three were replaced by pipes that carry the flow under the creek or river which the canal crossed. Geography The Hennepin Canal follows a natural low area between Hennepin and Rock Island. This is actually the ancient channel of the Mississippi River, which at one time flowed from Rock Island to Hennepin, and then south through what is now the Illinois River channel. The Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi River near Rock Island, diverting the Mississippi into its modern channel. History of the canal Sketch of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the proposed Hennepin Canal, showing their relations to the Illinois River, Mississippi River, and Lake Michigan, 1883, in the collection of the National Archives and Records Administration Hennepin Canal after construction The steamer Marion with Rambler in tow at Aqueduct number 4, 1908 Lock 31 Lock 24 The Hennepin Canal was built in order to lower freight prices. Local and government supporters struggled to get it built. The idea to build the canal arose in 1834 (Sage 1). It would allow the shipping of heavy and bulky freight where the railroad could not. The proposed canal would join the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers creating a quick route from Chicago to the Mississippi River. To build the canal would mean that local citizens would have to gain the support of their state and other beneficial government officials (Yeater 2). The canal reduced the distance from the Illinois River to the Mississippi by . Interest in the canal increased during the Civil War, when relations between the Union and the UK were deteriorating to the point where war was possible. If this happened, the St. Lawrence River and Welland Canal would be closed to U.S. ships, and people from the Great Lakes area could not compete in eastern markets. Because war did not occur, many of those who initially supported the project soon lost interest (Yeater 2). The state of Illinois would not allow the canal to be constructed out of its funds; therefore, during the remainder of the 1860s, several legislatures, most notably those from Iowa, Illinois, and New York, endeavored to establish the canal with government backing. Ulysses S. Grant, a resident of Illinois, was elected president in 1868. Because of this, the federal government began responding to the pressure from Illinois; however, the first federal survey was not made until two years later, in 1870. The survey was conducted under the authority of Colonel Wilson of the United States Corps of Engineers and done by Graham P. Low, Civil Engineer and surveyor. Low's plan was for the canal to be wide and in depth, with locks at the cost of $12,500,000. The United States Senate appointed a committee to study the value of Low's proposal. In 1881, four hundred representatives of commercial, city, and farmers associations from seven states met in Davenport, Iowa, to start a similar group called the Hennepin Canal Commission. It was created to negotiate with Chicago groups to stress the national importance of the canal. The committee concluded that a canal would regulate railroad freight rates (Yeater 3). Another survey had been made in 1882-83. The surveyor, Major W. H. H. Benyard of the U.S. Corps of Engineers, recommended one of the three proposed routes be selected. The route names were as follows: The Marais d‚ÄôOsier, Watertown, and Rock Island (Yeater 3). The eastern half of all three routes was the same; the canal would begin at the Illinois River about above Hennepin. The significant difference among the three lies at the western half, where the canal would end. In 1886, the United States Congress appointed a Board of Engineers to scrutinize the routes and investigate the effects the canal would have on national commerce. The board reported that benefits would exceed costs, and they suggested that the Marais d‚ÄôOsier route be selected. The report was accepted by the Secretary of War and the Chief Engineers; however, the route was later rejected because of commercial reasons and the greater military significance that the Rock Island route had to offer (Yeater 3). Fulton and Albany claimed that their cities were an ideal place for the canal, but Rock Island had a larger population and flourishing river port, so it was more convincing to construct at that location (Bastian 138). Although a survey had been made, from 1886 to 1889 Congress had considered plans but no construction had been started; however, in the year 1890, Congress provided $500,000 to start the first five miles (Bastian 3). Although the canal planning was complete, there still were problems. The planning of the feeder canal still remained. Only one thing was certain; the feeder would tap the water at the Rock River. The river's water would then flow into the main canal. But where should the feeder be constructed (Yeater 4)? The initial suggestion was to place the feeder at Dixon. The citizens of Rock Falls and neighboring Sterling were informed that the War Department would make a decision of the length, cost, and route. As a result, area people began to raise funds (Bastian 138). As these actions were taking place, C.C. Johnson, minority leader of legislature, and C. L. Sheldon went to Washington, D.C., to discuss the matter with Honorable Redfield Potter, Secretary of War. When they returned, a survey was made that showed that the tapping of the river at Rock Falls would be eleven miles (18 km) shorter and cheaper than tapping at Dixon would be; government officials checked figures, and the decision was made to build at Rock Falls (Hennepin Canal Feeder). The Hennepin Canal construction project began on September 19, 1890. When construction started, the estimated cost of the project was $6,925,900 (Yeater 5). Now that the planning had been approved, construction must be started; however, unlike many American canals, the Hennepin Canal was constructed after railroads came into being. Consequently, eight bridges had to be built. In addition to the railroad bridges, sixty-seven highway bridges had to be constructed too, thus creating delays (Bastian 138). The commanding engineer asked the Secretary of War to use concrete for the locks. This request was strange because all locks in that time period were made from cut stone. On May 11, 1891, regardless of what locks were made of in the past, the Secretary of War granted permission to use concrete. Because concrete cost fifty percent less than cut stone masonry, a five-foot width increase would be added to plans (Yeater 5). After the setbacks, the canal construction continued promptly; however, it did not continue uninterrupted. Workers discovered three miles (5 km) of peat bog; therefore, the bed of the canal was lined with clay to prevent water loss. In 1894, the construction on the eastern half began. This section was the most difficult because the canal ascends from the sea level, thus requiring 21 locks to regulate the water. There were 32 locks on the mainline (Yeater 5). All locks measure and were capable of passing barges long. The average barge was twice that size and drew too much water for the six-foot-deep canal (‚ÄúBuilder Tells Early Days of Hennepin Canal‚Äù 2). On the feeder canal, there was only one lock, called the guard lock, which was constructed to protect the canal from high river water. All thirty-three locks were manually operated (Yeater 5). On December 6, 1906, the Sterling Hydraulic Company agreed on the original plan to construct the dam at the foot of Tenth Avenue, Rock Falls (Hennepin Canal Feeder). By 1907, the dam was the only major project left on the canal. The stone excavated from Mile One of the feeder was used to build the dam (Bastian 138). To enclose the construction site, the coffer dam was built (The Hennepin Canal). Twenty-five locks were assembled and riveted. When the dam was finished, it was long (Bastian 140). The dam made the water rise above normal level. This led to the covering of of land. Water backed up all the way to Dixon. Many small islands remain submerged. After the completion of the canal in 1907, the feeder canal runs almost due south for . The main canal runs 75 miles (Hennepin Canal Feeder). One of the greatest crowds ever to gather in Rock Falls happened on October 24, 1907. A two and a half mile street parade in the morning was followed in the afternoon by a parade of boats from Rock Falls, Sterling, and Dixon (Hennepin Canal Feeder). When the canal was finished on October 21, 1907, the Corps of Engineers could not wait until spring for the first boat to pass down the canal. The first steamer to use the canal was the SS Marion, carrying government officials. This was the first boat to travel the entire length of the canal. The boat left on November 8 and returned on the November 15th. The canal was not completely filled, so each section's water had to be moved with the locks for the boat to pass. The boat had to be equipped with iron guards to break the formed ice. When it reached Lock 28, it had to push the lock open. When the boat reached the last five miles (8 km) of her journey, there was still a problem with the amount of water. There was too much water, and it could not pass under the Rock Island Bridge. As a result, the first people the sailors found were asked to come aboard to make the ship sink slightly (Yeater 6). Guests at the opening ceremony included Governor Charles S. Deneen, former Minnesota Governor Samuel R. Van Sant, who was born at Rock Island, and Congressman Frank Orren Lowden. Miss Grace Wheeler, the daughter of the chief engineer, opened the gates for the first time (Hennepin Canal Feeder). The early years were difficult because 1930 marked the beginning of the Great Depression. The Depression affected local businessmen and residents. In that year, overall tonnage on the canal decreased by 40 percent, and only 18,142 tons were transported (Yeater 9). A telephone system was built by the Corps of Engineers so that a lockman could be advised in advance when a boat was coming through the locks. There were 750-pound poles spanning across of the canal. Some of these poles remain standing today (Yeater 10). The canal was not only a route to transport coal, salt, grain, gravel, iron, steel, and many other crops and minerals, but it was a place for recreation as well. Family and friends would participate in picnics, swimming, and most noteworthy, fishing. Fish caught in the Hennepin Canal still hold Illinois records. Swimming was also popular, so popular, in fact, that the local YMCAs held swimming classes in the canal (Yeater 11). The Corps of Engineers employed fifty men full-time, year-round to operate and maintain the canal. The Corps divided the canal into sections. Each section had a lockman and/or a patrolman. Some of their tasks included patrolling banks, repairing breaks, operating the locks, servicing phone systems, etc. The lockmen and patrolmen were provided houses, barns, warehouses, sheds, and workshops. All of the houses had concrete walks and many other concrete things. The houses were never wired with electricity and did not have indoor plumbing. Every lockman and patrolman had a house but one. He did, however, have a houseboat (Yeater 11). Although the canal was not as successful as planned, some good came from it. In 1920, Ray Mechling and Fred Wolf of Rock Falls began a barge line. The canal required smaller barges so the two bought a steam boat and began erecting barges. They bought gravel and transported it to people who were interested in buying some. Besides gravel, they shipped steel and coal for the International Harvester Company (Yeater 12). Traffic on the canal was never heavy, and critics complained that it was obsolete when it was constructed and that it was too small and only fit for the early days of canaling. One local man stated, ‚ÄúIt was a source of frustration and ultimately a failure‚Äù.Bastian 142 Many have said if the canal had been constructed in the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s or even the 1860s, as it was originally suggested, the canal would have had greater economic potential. The canal was intended to connect the Upper Mississippi River Valley with the Atlantic Ocean; however, it did not (Yeater 12). However, the canal did give farmers relief from railroad prices (Builder Tells Early Days of Canal). In 1948, there was no reported traffic (Bastian 142). From the frustration came anger. This anger was, as many people would say, coming from the bad deterioration that the canal was suffering. It would cost $12,000,000 to make the canal bigger and deeper and make the locks larger (Yeater 12). Consequently, on April 7, 1948, the Corps of Engineers issued a ‚Äúnavigation notice‚Äù that put the canal on a limited service basis. All the chaos led to the suspension of all lock operations and non-essential maintenance in 1951 (Yeater 12). Legislators in Washington, D.C. and in Springfield were getting innumerable letters and petitions from Illinois citizens and conservationists. These groups organized campaigns with ‚ÄúSave the Canal‚Äù as their theme. The legislators of Illinois began to plan to take over the canal for recreation use. On August 1, 1970, full ownership was given to the state of Illinois to use the waterway as a place for recreations under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation. Bud Stigall stated that in 1970, it would cost 22 million dollars to get the canal in shape. Today the canal is used for recreational purposes. A trail along the canal allows people to walk, jog, or bike down the canal, and has been recently paved its entire length. During the winter months, the trail is heavily used for snowmobiling. Fishing is also popular; however, swimming is prohibited. From its inception in 1834 to its closure in 1951, the canal served as both a waterway and a place for recreation.

The primary focus is on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), the most important gases which caused acid rain; and particulates which cause visible air pollution, illness and premature deaths. SO2 can be removed by flue-gas desulfurization and NO2 by selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Particulates can be removed with electrostatic precipitators. Although perhaps less efficient, wet scrubbers can remove both gases and particulates. Reducing fly ash reduces emissions of radioactive materials. Mercury emissions can be reduced up to 95%. However capturing carbon dioxide emissions from coal is generally not economically viable. Regulations Since the 1970s, various policy and regulatory measures have driven coal pollution mitigation. In the US, the Clean Air Act was the primary driving force in reducing particulate emissions and acid rain from coal combustion. As regulations have increased the demand for coal pollution mitigation technologies, costs have fallen and performance has improved. The widespread deployment of pollution-control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide, NOx and dust emissions is just one example that brought cleaner air to many countries. The desire to tackle rising CO2 emissions to address climate change later introduced Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Within the United States, Carbon Capture and Storage technologies, also sometimes referred to as carbon capture and sequestration, are mainly being developed in response to regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äîmost notably the Clean Air Act‚Äîand in anticipation of legislation that seeks to mitigate climate change. Loan guarantees and tax incentives have a long history of use in Australia, EU countries, and the US to encourage the introduction of coal pollution mitigation and other technologies to reduce environmental impact. Environmental impact of coal =Greenhouse gases= Combustion of coal‚Äîwhich is mostly carbon‚Äîproduces carbon dioxide as a product of combustion. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a significant contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). Burning 1 ton of coal produces 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide. Carbon sequestration technology has yet to be tested on a large scale and may not be safe or successful. Sequestered CO2 may eventually leak up through the ground, may lead to unexpected geological instability or may cause contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies. As a quarter of world energy consumption in 2019 was from coal, reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the Paris Agreement will require modifications to how coal is used. =Measurement of pollution and availability of pollution data= In some countries, such as the EU, smokestack measurements from individual power plants must be published. Whereas in some countries, such as Turkey, they are only reported to the government not the public. However, since the late 2010s satellite measurements of some pollutants have been available. =Combustion By-products= By-products of coal combustion are compounds which are released into the atmosphere as a result of burning coal. Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals. When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e. particulate matter or PM) and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO2). Since air is mostly nitrogen, combustion of coal often leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are primary causes of acid rain. For many years‚Äîbefore greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat‚Äîit was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal. These by- products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations. It is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process. For example, various techniques are used in a coal preparation plant to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal prior to burning. During combustion, fluidized bed combustion is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an electrostatic precipitator and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with flue-gas desulfurization. Trace amounts of radionuclides are more difficult to remove. Coal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal mercury: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the US and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by- products do not pose a threat to public health. A study in 2013 found that mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia. Potential financial impact Whether carbon capture and storage technology is adopted worldwide will \\"...depend less on science than on economics. Cleaning coal is very expensive.\\" =Cost of converting a single coal-fired power plant= Conversion of a conventional coal-fired power plant is done by injecting the into ammonium carbonate after which it is then transported and deposited underground (preferably in soil beneath the sea). This injection process however is by far the most expensive. Besides the cost of the equipment and the ammonium carbonate, the coal-fired power plant also needs to use 30% of its generated heat to do the injection (parasitic load). A test-setup has been done in the American Electric Power Mountaineer coal-burning power plant. One solution to reduce this thermal loss/parasitic load is to burn the pulverised load with pure oxygen instead of air. =Cost implications for new coal-fired power plants= Newly built coal- fired power plants can be made to immediately use gasification of the coal prior to combustion. This makes it much easier to separate off the from the exhaust fumes, making the process cheaper. This gasification process is done in new coal-burning power plants such as the coal-burning power plant at Tianjin, called \\"GreenGen\\". =Costs for China= costs of retrofitting CCS are unclear and the economics depends partly on how the Chinese national carbon trading scheme progresses. =Costs for India= some argue that \\"with the right policy initiatives and market design\\" gasification with CCS would be cost effective for some coal plants. Politics =Australia= In Australia, carbon capture and storage was often referred to by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as a possible way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (The previous Prime Minister John Howard had stated that nuclear power was a better alternative, as CCS technology may not prove to be economically feasible.) =Canada= In 2014 SaskPower a provincial-owned electric utility finished renovations on Boundary Dam's boiler number 3 making it the world's first post-combustion carbon capture storage facility. The renovation project ended up costing a little over $1.2 billion and can scrub out CO2 and toxins from up to 90 percent of the flue gas that it emits. =China= Since 2006, China releases more than any other country. Researchers in China are focusing on increasing efficiency of burning coal so they can get more power out of less coal. It is estimated that new high efficiency power plants could reduce CO2 emission by 7% because they won't have to burn as much coal to get the same amount of power. =India= =Japan= Following the catastrophic failure of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant in Japan that resulted from the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent widespread public opposition against nuclear power, high energy, lower emission (HELE) coal power plants were increasingly favored by the Shinz≈ç Abe-led government to recoup lost energy capacity from the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan and to replace aging coal and oil-fired power plants, while meeting 2030 emission targets of the Paris Agreement. 45 HELE power plants have been planned, purportedly to employ integrated gasification fuel cell cycle, a further development of integrated gasification combined cycle. Japan had adopted prior pilot projects on IGCC coal power plants in the early-1990s and late-2000s. =United States= In the United States, \\"clean coal\\" was mentioned by former President George W. Bush on several occasions, including his 2007 State of the Union Address. Bush's position was that carbon capture and storage technologies should be encouraged as one means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. During the US Presidential campaign for 2008, both candidates John McCain and Barack Obama expressed interest in the development of CCS technologies as part of an overall comprehensive energy plan. The development of pollution mitigation technologies could also create export business for the United States or any other country working on it. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, signed in 2009 by President Obama, allocated $3.4 billion for advanced carbon capture and storage technologies, including demonstration projects. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that \\"we should strive to have new electricity generation come from other sources, such as clean coal and renewables\\", and former Energy Secretary Dr. Steven Chu has said that \\"It is absolutely worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage\\", noting that even if the U.S. and Europe turned their backs on coal, developing nations like India and China would likely not. During the first 2012 United States presidential election debate, Mitt Romney expressed his support for clean coal, and claimed that current federal policies were hampering the coal industry. Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management The Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management is part of the United States Department of Energy. It sponsors research into \\"clean coal\\" technology. https://www.energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/office-clean-coal- and-carbon-management Criticism of the approach Environmentalists such as Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program, believes that the term \\"clean coal\\" is misleading: \\"There is no such thing as clean coal and there never will be. It's an oxymoron.\\" The Sierra Club's Coal Campaign has launched a site refuting the clean coal statements and advertising of the coal industry. Complaints focus on the environmental impacts of coal extraction, high costs to sequester carbon, and uncertainty of how to manage end result pollutants and radionuclides. In reference to sequestration of carbon, concerns exist about whether geologic storage of CO2 in reservoirs, aquifers, etc., is indefinite/permanent. The palaeontologist and influential environmental activist Tim Flannery made the assertion that the concept of clean coal might not be viable for all geographical locations. Critics also believe that the continuing construction of coal-powered plants (whether or not they use carbon sequestration techniques) encourages unsustainable mining practices for coal, which can strip away mountains, hillsides, and natural areas. They also point out that there can be a large amount of energy required and pollution emitted in transporting the coal to the power plants. The Reality Coalition, a US non-profit climate organization composed of the Alliance for Climate Protection, the Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the League of Conservation Voters, ran a series of television commercials in 2008 and 2009. The commercials were highly critical of attempts to mitigate coal's pollution, stating that without capturing CO2 emissions and storing it safely that it cannot be called \\"clean coal\\". Greenpeace is a major opponent of the concept, because they view emissions and wastes as not being avoided but instead transferred from one waste stream to another. According to Greenpeace USA's Executive Director Phil Radford speaking in 2012, \\"even the industry figures it will take 10 or 20 years to arrive, and we need solutions sooner than that. We need to scale up renewable energy; 'clean coal' is a distraction from that.\\" Clean coal The term Clean Coal in modern society often refers to the carbon capture and storage process. The term has been used by advertisers, lobbyists, and politicians such as Donald Trump. =Prior terminology= The industry term \\"clean coal\\" is increasingly used in reference to carbon capture and storage, an advanced theoretical process that would eliminate or significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based plants and permanently sequester them. More generally, the term has been found in modern usage to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation, and use. U.S. Senate Bill 911 in April, 1987, defined clean coal technology as follows: > \\"The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or > existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions > of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of > coal in the generation of electricity.\\" Before being adopted in this fashion, historically \\"clean coal\\" was used to refer to clean-burning coal with low levels of impurities, though this term faded after rates of domestic coal usage dropped. The term appeared in a speech to mine workers in 1918, in context indicating coal that was \\"free of dirt and impurities.\\" In the early 20th century, prior to World War II, clean coal (also called \\"smokeless coal\\") generally referred to anthracite and high- grade bituminous coal, used for cooking and home heating.\\"Smokeless Coal,\\" WVa-USA.com, accessed May 2008. Clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed in attempts to lessen the negative environmental impact of coal energy generation and to mitigate worldwide climate change. When coal is used as a fuel source, the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury, and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used. These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal, gasification (see also IGCC), improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals (brown coals) to improve the calorific value, and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity. Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery, potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage, and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter. In its original usage, the term \\"Clean Coal\\" was used to refer to technologies that were designed to reduce emission of pollutants associated with burning coal, such as washing coal at the mine. This step removes some of the sulfur and other contaminants, including rocks and soil. This makes coal cleaner and cheaper to transport. More recently, the definition of clean coal has been expanded to include carbon capture and storage. Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx, the most important gases in causation of acid rain, and particulates which cause visible air pollution and have deleterious effects on human health. Technology Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept: *Pre- combustion capture ‚Äì This involves gasification of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, which may be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2-rich gas mixture, from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered, This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations. *Post- combustion capture ‚Äì This refers to capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes. *Oxy-fuel combustion ‚Äì Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low- cost CO2 capture. The Kemper County IGCC Project, a proposed 582 MW coal gasification-based power plant, was expected to use pre-combustion capture of CO2 to capture 65% of the CO2 the plant produces, which would have been utilized and geologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations. However, after many delays and a cost runup to $7.5 billion (triple the initial budget), the coal gasification project was abandoned and as of late 2017, Kemper is under construction as a cheaper natural gas power plant. The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields. An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO2 so that it may be stored or sequestered An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon- capture technology is Swedish company Vattenfall‚Äôs Schwarze Pumpe power station located in Spremberg, Germany, built by German firm Siemens, which went on-line in September 2008. The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/25-can-clean-coal-actually- work/?searchterm=clean%20coal \\"Can Clean Coal Actually Work?\\" article in Feb. 2009 issue, p. 18, Retrieved 2009-05-11 Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. Callide Power Station has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology. Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.[leads nowhere previously cited - http://ww25.thermoenergy.com/Zm9yY2VTUg] Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater low-rank coals. Low-rank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent. Demonstration projects in the United States In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology & Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation. The National Energy Technology Laboratory has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round: *Round 1 CCPI Projects ** Advanced Multi-Product Coal Utilization By-Product Processing Plant ** Demonstration of Integrated Optimization Software at the Baldwin Energy Complex ** Gilberton Coal-to-Clean Fuels and Power Co-Production Project ** Increasing Power Plant Efficiency: Lignite Fuel Enhancement ** TOXECON Retrofit for Mercury and Multi-Pollutant Control on Three 90-MW Coal-Fired Boilers ** Western Greenbrier Co-Production Demonstration Project ** Commercial Demonstration of the Airborne Process ** Integration of Advanced Emission Controls to Produce Next-Generation Circulating Fluid Bed Coal Generating Unit *Round 2 CCPI Projects ** Airborne Process Commercial Scale Demonstration Program ** Demonstration of a Coal-Based Transport Gasifier ** Mercury Species and Multi- Pollutant Control Project ** Mesaba Energy Project *Round 3 CCPI Projects ** American Electric Power Project ** Antelope Valley Station Post-Combustion CO2 Project ** Hydrogen Energy California Project ** NRG Energy Project ** Southern Company Carbon Capture Kemper Project (switching to natural gas) ** Summit Texas Clean Energy Project These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program. According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy. Clean coal and the environment According to United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a major contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal- fired generation (see World energy resources and consumption), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol will require modifications to how coal is utilized. Coal, which is primarily used for the generation of electricity, is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the US. The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation. The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of \\"traditional\\" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development. There is still concern about clean coal technology being perceived as more environmentally friendly than it is, and the term \\"Clean Coal\\" has been used as an example of \\"greenwashing\\". According to the Sierra Club, \\"Despite the industry's hype, there's no such thing as 'clean coal.' But new technologies and policies can help reduce coal plants' deadly emissions.\\" Conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries. Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of water sources such as oceans and aquifers used for drinking water supplies. The Great Plains Synfuels plant supports the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. A drawback of the carbon sequestration process is that it is expensive compared to traditional processes.

The long-string instrument is a musical instrument in which the string is of such a length that the fundamental transverse wave is below what a person can hear as a tone (¬±20 Hz). If the tension and the length result in sounds with such a frequency, the tone becomes a beating frequency that ranges from a short reverb (approx 5‚Äì10 meters) to longer echo sounds (longer than 10 meters). Besides the beating frequency, the string also gives higher pitched natural overtones. Since the length is that long, this has an effect on the attack tone. The attack tone shoots through the string in a longitudinal wave and generates the typical science-fiction laser-gun sound as heard in Star Wars. The sound is also similar to that occurring in upper electricity cables for trains (which are ready made long-string instruments in a way). History A long string instrument was one of the techniques by which Mersenne tested Galileo's hypothesis, now known under Mersenne's name, by making string vibration speed visible and countable.Bertoloni Meli, Domenico (2006). Thinking with Objects: The Transformation of Mechanics in the Seventeenth Century, p.115. Johns Hopkins University. . For example if a string 0.33 meters long, of given mass and tension, produces A440, a string with identical mass and tension but eight times as long, 2.64 meters, produces 55 hertz. One example of a long-string instrument was invented by the American composer Ellen Fullman. It is tuned in just intonationEllen Fullman Biography , ellenfullman.com and played by walking along the length of its approximately 100 -long strings and rubbing them with rosined hands and producing longitudinal vibrations. A C-clamp is used on each string for putting tension on the strings, much like a guitar capo, and a resonator is placed on the end the musician faces. This long- string instrument's range is centered on the octave of middle C and extends above and below this by an octave. The strings of the bass octave extend the instrument's full 90 feet. Fullman is not the only person who has built long- string instruments. Alvin Lucier employed a monochord of up to 25 meters in his piece Music on a Long Thin Wire (1977).Album notes for Music on a Long Thin Wire, Lovely Music/Lovely.com. In 1981 Terry Fox also recorded two musical pieces called Berlin Attic Wire, Beating with a long string instrument.Terry Fox on Ubuweb.

Book cover Whether printed on the dust jacket of a hardcover book, or on the cover of a paperback, book cover art has had books written on the subject. Numerous artists have become noted for their book cover art, including Richard M. Powers and Chip Kidd. In one of the most recognizable book covers in American literature, two sad female eyes (and bright red lips) adrift in the deep blue of a night sky, hover ominously above a skyline that glows like a carnival. Evocative of sorrow and excess, the haunting image has become so inextricably linked to The Great Gatsby that it still adorns the cover of F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs masterpiece 88 years after its debut. The iconic cover art was created by Spanish artist Francis Cugat. With the release of a big Hollywood movie, however, some printings of the book have abandoned the classic cover in favor of one that ties in more closely with the film. 2013 film A book cover is usually made up of images (illustrations, photographs, or a combination of both) and text. It usually includes the book title and author and can also include (but not always) a book tagline or quote. The book cover design is usually designed by a graphic designer or book designer, working in-house at a publisher or freelance. Once the front cover art has been approved, they will then continue to design the layout of the spine (including the book title, author name and publisher imprint logo) and the back cover (usually including a book blurb and sometimes the barcode and publisher logo). Books can be designed as a set of series or as an individual design. Very commonly the same book will be designed with a different cover in different countries to suit the specific audience. For example, a cover designed for Australia may have a completely different design in the UK and again in the USA. Magazine cover Magazine cover artists include Art Spiegelman, who modernized the look of The New Yorker magazine, and his predecessor Rea Irvin, who created the Eustace Tilly iconic character for the magazine. Tabloid cover Today the word tabloid is used as a somewhat derogatory descriptor of a style of journalism, rather than its original intent as an indicator of half-broadsheet size. This tends to cloud the fact that the great tabloids were skilfully produced amalgams of intriguing human interest stories told with punchy brevity, a clarity drawn from the choice of simple but effective words and often with a healthy dose of wit.Day, Mark.

Angel was born in Chelsea, London, England.Cooper, Sean \\"Dave Angel Biography\\", AllMusic, retrieved 15 June 2011 He is the son of a London- based jazz musician, and the elder brother of rapper Monie Love. He had an unorthodox musical education; his father influenced him deeply, as did his friends and his environment, including the radio. He listened not only to Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, but also to soul music and funk. Even though he was playing instruments at 14 years old, including percussion, his musical development was not easy or straightforward. Career His musical career started when he borrowed an old electronic keyboard from a friend and, using a double tape deck, assembled a bassline and drum track, over which he laid \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" by Eurythmics. He called the result his Nightmare mix, and borrowed money from a friend to press 500 copies. When BMG, and thus the Eurythmics, learnt of this, Annie Lennox wanted to prevent the sale of what was in effect an unlicensed version of their song; however, her partner Dave Stewart liked the mix, and persuaded her to allow Angel to go ahead. The track, involving elements of jazz, Detroit techno, and breakbeat hardcore, was successful, reaching number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. Not long afterwards, Angel received many invitations, and gained much respect from European artists, becoming part of the Phaze One team together with the drum & bass DJs Fabio and Grooverider (who used to play styles from house to hardcore at that time). The doors were also opened for his career as a producer. Despite the quality of his productions, however, such as the EPs \\"The Family\\" by Apollo and \\"Royal Techno\\" by Rotation Records, he was unable to make much impression in England. Through his label, Rotation Records, he gave opportunities to many of the current producers, including many of other nationalities, such as Paul Hazel, Cisco Ferreira, Vince Watson, Samuel L. Session, Steve Rachmad, and Sharpside. He released tracks for labels such as Black Market, Love, Rotation, and specially the Belgian R&S; Records. 1995 saw the release through Studio !K7 of his CD \\"X-Mix-4 ‚Äì Beyond The Heavens\\", which included songs from all over the world such as Chez Damier's \\"Help Myself\\", F2's \\"Dominica\\" and his remix for Sun Electric's \\"Entrance.\\" The second half of the 1990s brought Angel closer to funk than jazz when he released tracks from the LP Globetrotting, such as \\"Tokyo Stealth Fighter\\", \\"This is Disco\\", and \\"Funk Music\\". Over the years that followed, he gained a central position on the international scene, making appearances at the biggest events and festivals; he plays all over the world, and has become an important figure in international techno. Angel is the father of UK rapper Fabien Darcy.

Along a traditional pathway for Native Americans, European settlers, and British troops during colonial times, in the early 20th century, the small valley that became known as Breezewood was a popular stopping place for automobile travelers on the Lincoln Highway, beginning in 1913. Greyhound Lines opened a Post House facility in the town in 1935; it closed in 2004. In 1940, Breezewood was designated exit 6 on the just-opened Pennsylvania Turnpike. In the 1960s, Breezewood became the junction of the Turnpike and the new Interstate 70. Later renumbered exit 12, it is now exit 161 on the Turnpike following a change to mileage-based exit numbering. Breezewood has been labeled a \\"tourist trap\\" and choke point because traffic between I-70 and the Turnpike is routed along surface streets lined with gas stations, hotels, restaurants, and traffic lights, rather than directly via a freeway-to-freeway junction. This segment of I-70 is one of the few parts of the Interstate Highway System which is not a controlled-access highway.  History  The community which became known as Breezewood has a long history of serving cross-country travelers. = Early history = Before the Europeans arrived, an old trail of the Native Americans crossed through there. Later, in colonial times before the American Revolutionary War (1776‚Äì1781) and the Conestoga wagons of the westbound settlers, a wagon road passed through. A British military trail was built in 1758 by General John Forbes from Chambersburg to Pittsburgh during the French and Indian War. It was later known as the Pittsburgh Road and the Conestoga Road. Through the tiny valley was built the Chambersburg-Bedford Turnpike, a private toll road which came later. = South Pennsylvania Railroad = Late in the 19th century, leaders of the New York Central Railroad (NYC) dreamed of building an east-west railroad across southern Pennsylvania through the Breezewood area to compete with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Over $10 million was spent and 26 lives lost when work on William H. Vanderbilt's planned South Pennsylvania Railroad project was halted in 1886. Control shifted to financier J.P. Morgan and PRR interests. The potentially competing South Pennsylvania Railroad was promptly abandoned and never completed, although much grading and tunneling work had been done. = Developing the community = A community called Rays Hill (or Nycumtown) was located just east of present-day Breezewood where a man named John Nycum had a small store. In 1836, he succeeded in establishing the Rays Hill Post Office and he served as the first Postmaster. The Rays Hill Post Office was the smallest in the country, at six feet by eight feet. On the western edge of Breezewood (or known as White Hall in the early 1800s), stands the Federal style mansion known as the Maple Lawn Inn (originally called Martin's Tavern), which opened around 1789. The 22-room building boasts 11 fireplaces, patriotic/masonic medallions, and was used as a stage coach stop and underground railroad safehouse, with a foundation several feet thick, and walls 3 to 4 bricks thick. It has been nominated to the National Register of Historic Places. With the advent of the automobile, by the early 20th century, the area in a small valley between Rays Hill and the Maple Lawn Inn had become known locally as Breezewood. The name was applied to a repair garage built in 1937. = 1913: Lincoln Highway, U.S. Route 30 = On July 1, 1913, American automotive pioneer Carl G. Fisher and other automobile enthusiasts and industry officials announced plans for the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental paved roadway in the United States to be created specifically for motorists. Former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas A. Edison, both friends of Fisher, sent checks, as well as then-current President Woodrow Wilson, who has been noted as the first U.S. President to make frequent use of an automobile for what was described as stress-relief relaxation rides. In 1919, around the end of World War I, the U.S. Army undertook its first Transcontinental Motor Convoy. It followed the Lincoln Highway from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to San Francisco, California, passing through Breezewood. The trip demonstrated the potential military importance of such a roadway, as well as the need for consistency in both improvements and maintenance. One of the young Army officers was Dwight David Eisenhower, then a Lt. Colonel. The convoy was memorable enough for him to include a chapter on the trip entitled \\"Through Darkest America With Truck and Tank,\\" in At Ease: Stories I Tell to Friends (Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1967). During World War II, then-General Eisenhower was also deeply impressed with the German autobahn roadway network. Those experiences combined to convince him the need to support construction of the Interstate Highway System when he became President of the United States in 1953. The portion of the Lincoln Highway from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh received the transcontinental U.S. Route 30 designation, which it still bears. = 1940: Pennsylvania Turnpike = When the Pennsylvania Turnpike was built in the 1930s, the tiny eastern Bedford County locality made sure it would be served by the new highway. Breezewood is at the original exit 6 of the Turnpike, which opened on October 1, 1940. The new turnpike used much of the earlier South Pennsylvania Railroad project for its right-of-way, grading, and tunnels. Breezewood, with a faded sign proclaiming it the \\"Town of Motels\\" and the \\"Traveler's Oasis\\", boomed after the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened, with one gas station and the first traveler's stop, the Gateway Motel and Restaurant. Gateway remains open today as a truck stop affiliated with T/A,TravelCenters of America LLC  The one stop for all your travel needs. . Tatravelcenters.com. Retrieved on July 23, 2013. competing with other gas stations, hotels, restaurants, and a Flying J franchise. = 1960s: Connecting the Turnpike with the new I-70 = Over 25 years later, when Interstate 70 was built through Pennsylvania, it was co- signed with the Pennsylvania Turnpike for 86 miles, between Breezewood and New Stanton. The I-70 section of the Turnpike included tunnels under the eastern continental divide of the Allegheny Mountains and Laurel Hill, crossing some of Pennsylvania's most rugged terrain. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was later abandoned. About the same time as I-70 was built, in the early and mid-1960s, a major group of improvements was made to the original turnpike. These included roadway capacity improvement along the portion shared with I-70 at the two major mountains, where traffic had been reduced to two lanes in tunnels, and a realignment of the Breezewood exit and the turnpike to the east from there.  Unusual I-70 alignment  I-70/I-76 Interchange I-70 uses a surface road (part of US 30) with at-grade intersections to connect the freeway heading south to Hancock, Maryland, with the ramp to I-76, which through this section is the Pennsylvania Turnpike toll road. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the peculiar arrangement at Breezewood resulted because at the time I-70's toll-free segment was built, the state did not qualify for federal funds under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 to build a direct interchange, unless it agreed to cease collecting tolls on the Turnpike once the construction bonds were retired‚Äîa direct interchange would have meant that a westbound driver on I-70 could not choose between the toll route and a free alternative, but would be forced to enter the Turnpike. However, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission was not willing to build the interchange with its own funds, due to the expected decrease in revenue once Interstate 80 was completed through the state. Accordingly, the state chose to build the unusual Breezewood arrangement in lieu of a direct interchange, thus qualifying for federal funds because this arrangement gave drivers the option of continuing on the untolled US 30. Although laws have been relaxed since then, local businesses, including many traveler services like fast food restaurants, gas stations and motels, have lobbied to keep the gap and not directly connect I-70 to the Turnpike, fearing a loss of business. In order for a bypass to be considered, Breezewood's own Bedford County must propose it, which is \\"just not an issue that really appears on the radar for us,\\" said Donald Schwartz, the Bedford County planning director. The short stretch of I-70 through Breezewood is one of only two locations in the U.S. where there are traffic lights on a two-digit Interstate Highway (the other being Interstate 78 in Jersey City, New Jersey, at the west portal to the Holland Tunnel). Former Pennsylvania State Senate President Pro Tempore Robert Jubelirer was not in favor of building a direct interchange between the two interstates. Despite this abnormality, this is not the only area where the Turnpike has had an indirect interchange with an Interstate highway due to this funding glitch, although it is the only one where an Interstate highway has had to run onto a surface street. Interstate 79 in Cranberry Township; Interstate 81 near Carlisle; and Interstate 95 in Bristol Township have had, for decades, no direct connection to the mainline Turnpike, with I-79 relying on U.S. Route 19 to get onto the Turnpike and vice versa, while I-81 has had to rely on U.S. Route 11 for Turnpike access and vice versa, and I-95 had no access to the Turnpike at all. (Interstate 99, which relies on U.S. Route 220 for Turnpike access near Bedford, was only commissioned in 1998.) While direct access between I-79 and the Turnpike became possible in 2003 and another project to connect I-95 with the Turnpike opened in 2018, the indirect access in Carlisle remains. = 2000s: Pike 2 Bike = The Pennsylvania Turnpike sold most of a 13-mile (21 km) abandoned stretch to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy (SAC) for $1 in 2001. The property is managed by Friends of the Pike 2 Bike, a coalition converting the stretch from Breezewood eastward into a bike trail. There are two tunnels located on Pike 2 Bike's trail. The Rays Hill Tunnel, and the Sideling Hill Tunnel. Both tunnels were left abandoned after that stretch of the turnpike closed.  Tourist services and amenities  Approximately 2.6 million vehicles exited the turnpike through Breezewood in 1995. By 2003, that figure had increased to 3.4 million. During high traffic periods, the arrangement can result in extended traffic jams on all three highways. There are a number of gasoline and diesel fuel choices, including several equipped to handle trucks and buses. Within the several- block area, a wide variety of family-style restaurants and fast-food outlets are available. Breezewood continues to meet its claim of \\"Town of Motels\\"; through the years, it has offered many hundreds of hotel and motel rooms. According to a 1990 article in The New York Times, Breezewood offered \\"no less than 10 motels, 14 fast-food restaurants and 7 fuel and service stations, including two sprawling truck stops.\\" Approximately 1,000 people are employed in Breezewood's commercial district. Business Week stated in 1991 that Breezewood is \\"perhaps the purest example yet devised of the great American tourist trap...the Las Vegas of roadside strips, a blaze of neon in the middle of nowhere, a polyp on the nation's interstate highway system.\\"  Community  The Breezewood community is not incorporated under Pennsylvania law and is treated as a portion of East Providence Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Commerce in Breezewood is about 75 percent of East Providence Township's tax base. Although it is not being tracked by the Census Bureau, the settlement has been assigned the ZIP code of 15533. There are few residences in the immediate area of Breezewood.

It stars Chuck Norris as a sheriff who must stop a mentally ill man (Brian Libby) who goes on a rampage after being granted near-indestructibility in a medical experiment. It grossed $10.5 million on release. Plot In a small Texas town, John Kirby, a mentally ill man, kills two members of the family with whom he was staying. Sheriff Daniel \\"Dan\\" Stevens and his deputy Charlie, respond and eventually arrest John, but he breaks out of the handcuffs, overpowers the other officers and grabs a shot gun, forcing the officers to open fire and shoot John. Severely injured and near death, John is transported to an institute where his psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas \\"Tom\\" Halman, works along with Dr. Phillip Spires and Dr. Paul Vaughn, two doctors and geneticists. To save John, Phillip proposes treating him with a formula created by himself and Paul to enhance cellular strength and regeneration. Tom objects to its use due to John's psychosis, and Phillip pretends to agree but later administers the formula anyway once Tom leaves. Revived and rendered nearly mute but virtually invulnerable, John escapes from the institute and tracks Tom to his home, having overheard Tom telling Phillip to allow John to die earlier. Meanwhile, Dan invites Tom's sister Alison, whom is he romancing, on a trip. John breaks into Tom's home and the two fight. Despite shooting John several times and pushing him down a flight of stairs, Tom is killed. Tom's wife Nancy finds her husband's body and is killed by John as well. Alison arrives to pick up her gear for the trip and discovers her brother and sister-in-law's corpses, but John flees as Dan and Charlie arrive with the police. Dan and Charlie take Alison to the institute, unaware that John has also returned there to get Phillip and Paul to treat his wounds. Realizing that the situation is out of control, Phillip leaves to examine samples while Paul attempts to kill John by injecting him with acid. John survives and kills Paul after a brief struggle by stabbing him with the syringe. After finding Paul's body, Phillip returns to his office, where he briefly speaks to John about the success of their experiment. John initially seems to understand Phillip but ultimately snaps his neck. With Dan at the county coroner's office, Charlie and Alison discover John killing another of the institute workers; Charlie attempts to arrest him but is mortally wounded when John breaks his back. Dan returns just in time to discover Charlie dying and protects Alison from John. Dan shoots John and knocks him out of a window, but John revives and nearly kills Dan. John hangs on to Dan's car as Dan and Allison try to escape and climbs into its back window, forcing them to jump out. The car crashes and explodes, lighting John on fire. This injures him, but he jumps into a nearby lake and quickly recovers. With Alison watching, Dan and John engage in hand-to-hand combat. Both men score blows, but Dan overwhelms John by roundhouse kicking him several times before throwing him into a nearby well, seemingly killing him. With John's carnage at an end, Dan and Alison leave. However, deep in the well, John suddenly bursts from the water, having survived.

He was offered the film by executive producer Paul Lewis, although he says Tony Under \\"was really the mover and shaker who was essential to the whole thing.\\" He says \\"The reason Chuck Norris wanted to do the picture ‚Äì and I think it was the reason we all wanted to do the picture ‚Äì is because it was a major studio picture.\\" Miller said the film was written with Chuck Norris in mind. \\"You don‚Äôt hire Chuck Norris not to do karate. It wasn‚Äôt like it was an old John Wayne script that they ended up giving to Chuck. He does his thing. I think the idea was to try and broaden the audience in that it wasn‚Äôt a karate movie. In my mind, it was a Frankenstein movie. It was like Frankenstein meets Chuck.\\" Miller said the film was not inspired by slasher movies. \\"I‚Äôm not a fan of those. When I read it, I thought that it was Frankenstein. That‚Äôs what I was heading towards. We‚Äôll have the mad scientists bringing this guy back to life. Chuck will have to try to apprehend him.\\" Miller said Brian Libby was a stunt man who was a friend of Aaron Norris. \\"He reminded me of Lee Marvin. He came in and I thought, Okay, this guy can play Frankenstein‚Äôs creature. He was a real cooperative kind of guy. He never balked about anything. I put him in a silver suit, and put him through a lot. A lot of other actors would have thought that was beneath them, but he wasn‚Äôt like that.\\" Miller said Stephen Furst's character was like Andy Devine. The story that Furst's character tells Norris about the dog came from Furst. Filming began on July 30, 1981 in Dallas. It took 30 days. Director Michael Miller called the film \\"kung fu meets Frankenstein.\\"OFF STAGE: To Tony with love Chicago Tribune 5 July 1981: d3. Miller says Norris was most comfortable fighting. The actor improvised a love scene with Toni Kalem, \\"and that was a big deal for him,\\" said Miller. \\"I said, ‚ÄúJust talk and have fun,‚Äù I told him. He did, and it‚Äôs a nice little scene.\\" Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by Columbia Pictures in April 1982. It grossed $10,490,791 at the box office. Miller said he hoped to make sequels. \\"At the end, the guy is still not dead. But that never happened. I would have liked that. You can see that this guy is not a slasher. He kills people the way Frankenstein‚Äôs creature kills people. He throws them and bang.\\" Miller says the reason was \\"I don‚Äôt think this was one of Chuck‚Äôs favorite pictures. He went to the screening, and I think that was the last time I ever saw him. He seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn‚Äôt sure it was going to work. It was outside of the formulas he‚Äôd been doing. I think he was too much of a gentleman to ever say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù I just don‚Äôt think this was in his wheelhouse. He didn‚Äôt do any more slasher type pictures.\\" The film was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 2001.

On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Variety wrote that the film \\"seems as if it were made with a demographics sampler entitled '10 Sleazy Ways To Cash In On The Exploitation Market.' The only trouble is the filmmakers have employed all ten techniques in one picture.

It was sited at the festival's highest point looking out over the Fowlea Valley, next to the OS trigonometry marker-stone. The site is now completely enclosed by woodland. 45-metre long suspension bridge of hardwood, spanning the Rocky Valley and joining the paths along the Woodland Ridge, 2005. The Festival placed great emphasis on sculpture. Some works still remain on the site as of 2005, such as this sculpture, \\"Windborne (The Phoenix)\\" by Keir Smith. The view from the middle of the suspension bridge, looking out over the eastern edge of the retained garden parkland. Beyond, the new out-of-town retail park merges into Stoke-on-Trent's city-centre. The Stoke-on-Trent National Garden Festival was the second of Britain's national garden festivals. It was held in the city from 1 May to 26 October 1986, and was opened by the Queen. Preparation of the site involved the reclamation of land formerly occupied by the Shelton Bar steelworks (1830‚Äì1978), about two miles north-west of the city centre, between Hanley and Burslem. British Steel's adjacent Shelton Bar steel rolling mill remained in use, finally closing in 2000. Reclaiming the site One of the leading political forces behind the festival idea was Councillor Cyril Finney (Conservative, the son of a miner), who also pushed through the vital dual carriageway linking the A500 road with the festival site. The site reclamation cost ¬£5 million, and the festival itself cost ¬£18 million. The reclaimers of the festival site had to contend with highly contaminated and mine shafted land, and there is still debate among environmental professionals about how such a high-quality clean-up was accomplished in such a short time. A community employment scheme ran alongside the work. Around 300,000 trees were planted by small teams, some groups comprising ex-steelworkers. Not knowing how trees should be planted, they were planted in what seemed at the time like disarray. It later transpired that this ad hoc method of planting resulted in a planted woodland that very closely matched natural-growth woodland, with trees of different types and ages growing alongside each other. Railway on site A lengthy gauge railway was built around the grounds with five stations. All the equipment was supplied by the firm of Severn Lamb. The railway had five stations located around the site with an engine shed, which was repurposed from a disused British Steel shed left over before the site was reclaimed, located at the north end of the site. The four identical locomotives were all powered by Perkins 4236 diesel engines with Linde hydraulic transmission driving the four wheels. A standard gauge track was laid at the main entrance and duties fell to Robert Heath No 6, 0-4-0 steam locomotive which originally was built in 1885 and now resides at the Foxfield Railway, Blythe Bridge, Staffordshire. Upon closure the entire railway was sold to the Bygones Village museum in Fleggburgh, Norfolk. Two of the locos, some of the track and most of the carriages were resold to a safari park in Spain. The remaining two locos plus four carriages were retained for use at Fleggburgh. The locos received new steam-outline bodywork and the carriages were rebuilt with full doors and windows. Commemorative memorabilia A set of commemorative stamps were issued nationally by the Post Office. An extremely rare Dungeons and Dragons module, \\"Up the Garden Path\\", was based on the festival site; only about thirty copies are known to have survived. RPG adventurers travelled to the garden on a salamander-driven steam train run by gnomes. Festival Park: the site today The main site was completed in 1995, and is now known as Festival Park. It has been, for the most part, sympathetically treated by St. Modwen Properties who took on its management and development. Much of the parkland, pools and trails have been retained as public open space, and are maturing very well. Some of the gardens, such as the Moorlands Heather Rock Garden and The Rocky Valley, survive with their planting scheme relatively intact. Although most wooden structures have been left to return to nature, Festival Park is actively maintained by groundsmen. Some sculpture and a large Welsh slate water feature still remains, as does the full-size stone circle. The huge wooden suspension bridge across a wooded ravine remains and can still be used. The complex network of paths is maze- like, there is no signage, and it is very easy to get lost. the suspension bridge is closed off for repairs. It is currently being used by local wildlife photographers to capture photos of the Jay ‚Äì a brightly coloured member of the crow family. The birds can be seen most days in winter - don't forget to take peanuts or acorns to feed them. There is now a large 'out-of-town' retail park on the eastern side of the site ‚Äì on what was the festival's car-park and public market area ‚Äì that now merges into the lower reaches of the city centre. There is a large marina for narrowboats. Along the main road on the western edge of the site is the large Water World indoor swimming complex, a ski-slope, a ten-screen Odeon cinema, a ten-pin bowling alley, and a toboggan run. Festival Park's large four-star Moat House hotel incorporates Etruria Hall, former home of Josiah Wedgwood and Thomas Wedgwood. Next to Etruria Hall is the North Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce HQ. Numerous similar low-rise offices nestle in the parkland and around the pools of Festival Park. Groundwork UK created a ¬£1 million cycle-path along the bordering Trent and Mersey Canal in 1998, which is now part of the National Cycle Network. At the northern tip of the site, the large complex of festival greenhouses was retained after the festival closed. For decades these operated as the city council's plant nursery for the entire city. They have since been closed and the site is earmarked for a small geothermal power station ‚Äì the feasibility of which is currently being tested via seismic tests and other investigations. After the festival The Sentinel newspaper offices were also built on the far west of the site, and their large printing plant then served most newspapers in northern England. However, Sentinel Newspapers moved out of the site in 2012 and the site passed to online betting firm Bet365, who have built a major new purpose-built HQ there. At April 2011 the far western part of the site ‚Äì including the former steel rolling mill that closed in 2000 ‚Äì was proposed as an enterprise zone by the local enterprise partnership, but the bid failed as it did not conform to government guidelines. The city council tried again a few years later, and the enterprise zone was confirmed. Plans are now under- way for the implementation of the enterprise zone from 2017 onwards, with a focus to be on firms involved in innovative materials science and high-value design in ceramics. As of May 2017 the West Midlands Ambulance Service has an ambulance hub based at Forge Lane, the hub operates 24/7 providing emergency ambulance cover for all of North Staffordshire. The site was selected for its close proximity to the city centre and close road links to the A500. References Further reading * Morley, Joan.

Horapollo Horapollo is mentioned by the Suda (œâ 159) as one of the last leaders of Egyptian priesthood at a school in Menouthis, near Alexandria, during the reign of Zeno (AD 474-491). According to the Suda, Horapollo had to flee because he was accused of plotting a revolt against the Christians, and his temple to Isis and Osiris was destroyed. Horapollo was later captured and after torture converted to Christianity. Another, earlier, Horapollo alluded to by the Suda was a grammarian from Phanebytis, under Theodosius II (AD 408-450). To this Horapollo the Hieroglyphica was attributed by most 16th-century editors, although there were more occult opinions, identifying Horapollo with Horus himself, or with a pharaoh. Horapollo wrote commentaries on Sophocles, Alcaeus of Mytilene and Homer, and a work () on places consecrated to the gods. Photius (cod. 279), who calls him a dramatist as well as a grammarian, ascribes to him a history of the foundation and antiquities of Alexandria (unless this is by an Egyptian of the same name, who lived in the reign of Zeno, 474‚Äì491). Hieroglyphica The text of the Hieroglyphica consists of two books, containing a total of 189 explanations of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The books profess to be a translation from an Egyptian original into Greek by a certain Philippus, of whom nothing is known. The inferior Greek of the translation, and the character of the additions in the second book point to its being of late date; some have even assigned it to the 15th century. The text was discovered in 1419 on the island of Andros, and was taken to Florence by Cristoforo Buondelmonti (it is today kept at the Biblioteca Laurenziana, Plut. 69,27). By the end of the 15th century, the text became immensely popular among humanists and was translated into Latin by Giorgio Valla (in ms. Vat. lat. 3898). The first printed edition of the text appeared in 1505 (published by Manuzio), and was translated into Latin in 1517 by Filippo Fasanini, initiating a long sequence of editions and translations. From the 18th century, the book's authenticity was called into question, but modern Egyptology regards at least the first book as based on real knowledge of hieroglyphs, although confused, and with baroque symbolism and theological speculation, and the book may well originate with the latest remnants of Egyptian priesthood of the 5th century.Eco U., (1993) La Ricerca della Lingua Perfetta nella Cultura Europea (The Search for the Perfect Language, Fontana Press (1997), ), chapter 7: The Perfect language of Images Though a very large proportion of the statements seem absurd and cannot be accounted for by anything known in the latest and most fanciful usage, there is ample evidence in both books, in individual cases, that the tradition of the values of the hieroglyphic signs was not yet extinct in the days of their author. This approach of symbolic speculation about hieroglyphs (many of which were originally simple syllabic signs) was popular during Hellenism, whence the early Humanists, down to Athanasius Kircher, inherited the preconception of the hieroglyphs as a magical, symbolic, ideographic script. In 1556, the Italian humanist Pierio Valeriano Bolzani published a vast Hieroglyphica at Michael Isengrin's printing press in Basle, which was originally planned as an exegesis of Horapollo's. It was dedicated to Cosimo I de' Medici. The second part of book II treats animal symbolism and allegory, essentially derived from Aristotle, Aelian, Pliny and Artemidorus, and are probably an addition by the Greek translator.

The plot concerns a fictional 1970s rock band named \\"Strange Fruit\\", who, after being split up for two decades, are persuaded to get back together to perform at a reunion of the same concert venue where they played their last gig. The film focuses on the personal lives of the band members and those closest to them, and their individual experiences with approaching middle-age and the success that eluded them. It was nominated for two Golden Globes in 1999.  Plot  The band Strange Fruit performs at the 1977 Wisbech Rock Festival. Hughie Case tells how, due to the pursuit of \\"fame, fortune and fornication\\" ‚Äì and the drug overdose of their original singer, Keith Lovell ‚Äì this is their last performance. After various issues, the band prematurely ends their performance, frustrated over competing egos and members' lack of self-control. Twenty years later, a stranger who turns out to be the Festival's founder's son recognises keyboardist Tony Costello and convinces him to reunite the band for an anniversary show. Tony tracks down Karen Knowles, their original runaround-girl. Reluctant, she is inspired to return after finding memorabilia. She insists on being the manager, and Tony agrees. Gradually, Karen and Tony track down other members: bassist Les Wickes, now a family man and roofer; drummer David \\"Beano\\" Baggot, working at a nursery and on the run from the taxman; and lead singer Ray Simms who, after years of drug and alcohol abuse, is now sober. Though claiming to be working on a solo album, Simms has not released anything in ten years. The band meets up at the Red Lion pub. Everyone expects Brian Lovell, the band's lead guitarist, to be there. Karen says she could not find him but learned he donated his royalties to charity; everyone assumes he died. Their roadie, Hughie, turns up during their first rehearsal to resume his original role. Ray insists on playing guitar but is convinced to sing. They find a replacement for Brian in young Luke Shand, a talented guitarist who remains unaware of the band's tensions. Following a warm up European tour, Karen negotiates for the rights to their catalogue. Their initial performances are poorly received. Les, Beano, and Hughie hold little hope for the band, believing the dead Keith and missing Brian to be the main talent. Tony propositions Karen, but she resists, remaining attached to Brian. At a gig, Ray's over-the-top ideas backfire, and Les and Ray walk off. Following a confrontation with Les, Ray has a nervous breakdown, exacerbated by turning 50. Ray leaves the gig, buys drugs, and falls into a canal. Karen's daughter rescues him, and Ray's wife blames Karen for his troubles. Following an angry reaction from locals over volume levels, the band escape to their bus and flee. Les and Ray make up, and Ray says he \\"received a positive message\\" from Brian's ghost. The bus breaks down, and Karen confronts the band about their lack of confidence. When the band meet a girl wearing a Strange Fruit tour T-shirt that belonged to her father, they take it as a positive omen. The next few shows go well; the band becomes more optimistic. Following a record deal, the band records a new song written and sung by Les, which Ray had never previously allowed. However, after watching a recorded drunken TV interview in which Les and Beano imply that the band was better with Keith and Brian, Ray breaks down again and quits. As the band members return to their former lives, Karen and Claire visit Keith's grave to pay their respects. They find a note that quotes \\"The Flame Still Burns\\", a tribute to Keith written by Brian. Hughie is then confronted by Karen, and reluctantly admits he knows Brian is alive. Karen and Tony find Brian in a psychiatric hospital. He explains he gave up his material possessions to sever himself from his previous life. When he agrees to rejoin the band, the others follow. However, at a pre-show press conference, hostile questions cause Brian to walk out. Everyone but Luke follows, and Luke chastises the journalists. Visibly shaken, Brian decides to back out of the show but gives his blessing. Beano nearly misses the set when a stalker-groupie demands sex. The band starts their set with the same song with which they opened up the last Wisbech Festival. Though Ray's confidence is shaken, Tony saves him by playing \\"The Flame Still Burns\\". Brian is pleased to hear the band playing the song, which helps him finally overcome his demons, and joins the band onstage to play an inspiring guitar solo, much to everyone's surprise and delight.

Rolling Stones Peter Travers praised Brian Gibson's direction for crafting a \\"solid blend of humor and heart\\", the performances from the main cast (highlighting Nighy's portrayal of Ray), and the musical contributions from Mick Jones and Chris Difford for capturing '70s rock bombast, calling it a \\"prime piece of entertainment.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the movie a B+ rating, saying \\"The ensemble acting is fun, generous, and gentle, and the music [‚Ä¶] is as good as Strange Fruit ought to be, with classically grandiose '70s poetic sentiments. When the band hits its reunion climax, Still Crazy encourages frankly emotional tears. And why not: There‚Äôs nothing more comforting than the sight of grizzled old guys rocking on while the rest of us buy a ticket to feel young.\\" Marc Savlov from The Austin Chronicle gave initial praise to the film's \\"wicked comic energy\\" found early on, but felt it devolves into \\"a deadly dull mishmash\\" it never gets out of, saying \\"The problem with Still Crazy isn't that it's overly earnest (which it is) or that it's too easy to make fun of (minimum effort required), it's that cast and crew alike seem primed for comedy in the film's first half, and then abruptly depart those Nigel Tufnel-ed plains in favor of some serious soul-searching halfway in.\\" Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club found the film \\"overly dramatic and often dull\\" compared to This Is Spinal Tap and The Rutles, saying that if you look past its \\"cheap charm\\" you have a mishandled topic about middle-aged former rockers who lack sympathy for viewers to care about. =Accolades= In 1999, Still Crazy received two nominations at the 56th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy and Best Original Song for \\"The Flame Still Burns\\" by Chris Difford, Marti Frederiksen and Mick Jones, but lost both awards to Shakespeare in Love and \\"The Prayer\\" from Quest for Camelot respectively.

Demonstration of the clone tool to alter an image  Applications  A typical use for the tool is in ' ‚Äì more colloquially, \\"airbrushing\\" or \\"photoshopping\\" out an unwanted part of the image. If a part of an image is removed simply by cutting it out, then a hole is left in the background. The Clone tool can fill in this hole convincingly with a copy of the existing background from elsewhere in the image. A common use for this tool is to retouch skin, particularly in portraits, to remove blemishes and make skin tones more even. Cloning can also be used to remove other unwanted elements, such as telephone wires, an unwanted bird in the sky, and the like. A more automated method of object removal uses texture synthesis to fill in gaps. Of these, patch-based texture synthesis or \\"image quilting\\" is essentially an automated application of the clone tool, choosing the optimal source area so as to patch over with a minimal seam. In some cases, the undesired object is mixed with the remainder of the image, and a simple circular brush, even with feathering, would not work. For these cases, some programs allow an object to be selected by color/outline so other areas are not affected. Other programs allow edge/color sensitive brushes to deal with such objects.

His discoveries and studies of hominid fossils in Java and his studies of other important fossils of south-eastern Asia firmly established his reputation as one of the leading figures of 20th Century paleo- anthropology. Biography Von Koenigswald was born in Berlin in a period of intense interest and rapid growth in the study of evolution. He began his fossil vertebrate collection when he was fifteen with the acquisition of a rhinoceros molar during an excursion to Mauer, Germany. He subsequently studied geology and paleontology at Berlin, T√ºbingen, Cologne and Munich. =Java= Von Koenigswald's teacher Ferdinand Broili had good contacts with the Dutch geologists Karl Martin and Reinout Willem van Bemmelen. Through these contacts Von Koenigswald could join the Geological Survey of Java as paleontologist in late 1930. Financed in part through the Carnegie Foundation, he began a systematic survey of the country. Von Koenigswald made his most significant finds in this area of Asia between January 1931 and 1941. At age 33, he announced the discovery of a juvenile calvarium from Mojokerto and assigned it to Pithecanthropus erectus. This identification was criticized by the respected paleontologist Eug√®ne Dubois, but von Koenigswald did not change his identification. Between 1937 and 1941, a number of important hominid specimens emerged from Java. One of von Koenigswald's assistants brought him a piece of a Pithecanthropus skull in 1937. Unfortunately, an offer to pay for additional fossils by the piece led to specimens being broken into splinters by native helpers. One skull cap, the first Sangiran calvarium, was an exact duplicate of Dubois' Pithecanthropus calvarium. Other well-known fossils include the Sangiran B mandible, Sangiran 4 including the well-known maxilla with the diastema, and the 1939 and 1941 jaws assigned by von Koenigswald to Meganthropus paleojavanicus. His work on the fossils of Central Java, particularly from Sangiran, led him to claim that the mammalian remains of the area could be assigned to all three levels of the Pleistocene. All Javanese hominid fossils recovered emerged from three major sets of beds: :* Pucangan formation, Jetis beds dated to the Early Pleistocene, :* the Kabuh formation, Trinil beds dated to the Middle Pleistocene, and :* the Ngandong beds dated to the Upper Pleistocene. Von Koenigswald pointed out that these and other fossil discoveries since 1917 contradicted the 19th century idea that humans had an ancestor with a modern brain and ape jaw, and actually suggested the opposite relationship. The Java fossils are currently housed in the Senckenberg Museum with the financial support of the Werner Reimers Foundation of Bad Homburg. In 1937, von Koenigswald hosted paleontologist Franz Weidenreich's visit to Java to examine recent discovery sites. Also in 1937, von Koenigswald became a Dutch citizen. In 1938 von Koenigswald and Weidenreich together announced the discovery of a new skull of Pithecanthropus (P. robustus). Early in 1939, von Koenigswald took several Javanese hominin specimens to Weidenreich in Peking, China. Comparing the Sangiran and Choukoutien hominids led the two scientists to conclude that the specimens were closely allied. They decided to abandon the genus Sinanthropus, combining all the specimens into the earlier-named genus Pithecanthropus. Later, Pithecanthropus was incorporated into the genus Homo as Homo erectus. =World War II= World War II brought difficulty and danger to von Koenigswald in Java. He managed to hide his fossils from the invading Japanese, and although he, being a Dutch citizen, was interned in a prisoner-of-war camp, only one fossil skull was confiscated by the Japanese soldiers. It was presented to Emperor Hirohito but was recovered after the war. During the war years, Weidenreich's description of Sinanthropus was published. In a borrowed office at the American Museum of Natural History, Weidenreich added to their earlier work and reviewed the fossil record of human evolution, merging Sinanthropus and Pithecanthropus into a new taxon, Homo erectus, with various geographic sub-species. He published descriptions and assigned scientific names to some of von Koenigswald's discoveries, as he and others presumed that von Koenigswald was dead at the hands of the Japanese. After the war, von Koenigswald worked with Weidenreich at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City for eighteen months. =Netherlands= For the next twenty years, von Koenigswald filled a Chair of Palaeontology created for him at the Rijksuniversiteit at Utrecht, Netherlands. During his academic career, he visited sites in North and South Africa (1951‚Äì52), the Philippines, Thailand and Borneo (1957), and Pakistan (1966‚Äì67). In Pakistan, von Koenigswald and his students found specimens which included a palate assigned to a new species of the hominoid genus Sivapithecus and teeth considered to belong to Ramapithecus. In 1950 he became member, and in 1968 foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. von Koenigswald studied the relationships between African, Asian and European hominoid fossils attributed to Ramapithecus or its close allies such as Graecopithecus of Greece and Kenyapithecus of Fort Ternan, Kenya. It was his opinion that the Indian form was a hominid and the African form a pongid. This later led him to strongly press the claim of India as the original home of the Hominidae. After retiring from the Chair at Utrecht, the Werner-Reimers Foundation provided him with facilities at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. He, with the support of J. L. Franzen, directed this paleontological research center for the remaining fourteen years of his life. von Koenigswald died at his home in Bad Homburg near Frankfurt-am-Main in West Germany on July 10, 1982.

Tyson has noted that he composed the song in about 20 minutes in his then manager Albert Grossman's New York apartment in 1961. A significant composition of the early 1960s folk revival, the song is a melancholy reflection on a failing romantic relationship. The singer expresses a desire for a possible reunion in a new place in the future (\\"You could meet me if I sent you down the fare\\") but acknowledges the likelihood that the relationship is over (\\"But our good times are all gone/And I'm bound for moving on ...\\"). The song has a clear Canadian context and subtext, including an explicit mention of the province Alberta as well as references to long, cold winters. In 2005, CBC Radio One listeners chose this song as the greatest Canadian song of all time on the program 50 Tracks: The Canadian Version. http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/ian-sylvia/, Ian and Sylvia It is considered the unofficial anthem of Alberta. Ian and Sylvia and original history Ian & Sylvia's second Vanguard LP titled Four Strong Winds (stereo: VSD-2149; monaural: VRS-9133), released July 1963, entered the Billboard Top LPs at number 150 the week of September 28, 1963. The song was a hit in Canada, making the top ten of the single charts there in October 1963. In the United States, the song did not have the same initial chart success. Ian and Sylvia's single version (released on Vanguard 35021) entered the Cashbox magazine \\"Looking Ahead\\" chart in September 1963. It was then recorded by The Brothers Four in a version that \\"bubbled under\\" the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1963. Subsequently, it was released by Ian and Sylvia on an album of the same name released in the U.S. in April 1964.Ian and Sylvia Re-Releases and Discography It was released in a country arrangement by Bobby Bare in 1964 and became a number three hit on the U.S. country singles chart in early 1965. It also become a big hit in Norway in 1966 in a Norwegian version: \\"Mot ukjent sted\\" by The Vanguards and a big hit in Sweden in 1967 in a Swedish version, \\"Mot ok√§nt land\\", recorded by Hep Stars. Other versions The song has been recorded by many artists, including: Hank Snow, The Seekers, Judy Collins, the Chad Mitchell Trio, The Browns, Bob Dylan, Marianne Faithfull, The Searchers, Bruce & Terry, John Denver, The Kingston Trio, Trini Lopez, Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, Chad and Jeremy, The Wolfe Tones, Blue Rodeo, Joan Baez, Vanity Fare, Glenn Yarborough, Harry Belafonte, Tony Rice, Johnny Cash, The Carter Family, Hep Stars, Sarah McLachlan, David Wiffen, Schooner Fare, The Pilgrims, and David Houston. Neil Young recorded the song for his 1978 album Comes a Time, with harmony vocals from Nicolette Larson, and on The Band's The Last Waltz. It has received significant airplay over album oriented rock and classic rock radio stations and has become part of Young's concert repertoire, including featured performances during Young's yearly appearances at Farm Aid benefit concerts. Swedish artist Ulf Lundell recorded a translated cover called \\"Fyra vindar\\", for his 1985 album Den vassa eggen, which did not make the cut but was later included in a remastered edition in 1998. Another version of Swedish translation, \\"Mot ok√§nt land\\", appears on the 2016 album Vid Grinden by Georga. Norwegian band The Vanguards released it as \\"Mot ukjent sted\\" in 1965. Canadian legacy The song is performed on the last night of the Edmonton Folk Music Festival each year. Tyson and Gordon Lightfoot performed the song at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Ian and Sylvia sang the song together at the 50th anniversary of the Mariposa Folk Festival on July 11, 2010, in Orillia, Ontario. On April 5, 2013, a recording of the song by Ian Tyson was played during the funeral of former Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, as the honour guard brought his urn into the Jack Singer Concert Hall. The song is also referenced in A Prayer for Owen Meany, the 1989 novel by John Irving that deals with Americans living near or across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The narrator remembers how the main character, Owen, loved to hear that song as sung by the character of Hester.https://books.google.ca/books?id=pcCpqpWPKrkC&pg;=PA471&lpg;=PA471&dq;=four+strong+winds+A+Prayer+for+Owen+Meany+hester&source;=bl&ots;=sNcut62Z6-&sig;=ACfU3U3FTEFfk0kAQ9MjR7N7b4vjLOiGIg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwi84rDo0r7jAhVTCc0KHQ1DCYMQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=four%20strong%20winds%20A%20Prayer%20for%20Owen%20Meany%20hester&f;=false, A Prayer for Owen Meany References External links * \\"Four Strong Winds\\" at The Canadian Encyclopedia * Category:1961 songs Category:Bob Dylan songs Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:Trini Lopez songs Category:Hank Snow songs Category:Judy Collins songs Category:The Searchers (band) songs Category:Neil Young songs Category:Bobby Bare songs Category:Culture of Alberta Category:1963 singles Category:Songs written by Ian Tyson Category:Canadian folk songs Category:Songs about Canada Category:Works about human migration ","title":"Four Strong Winds"},{"id":"2423994","text":"Ladislaus I (also spelled Vladislav I or W≈Çadys≈Çaw I) may refer to: *Ladislaus I of Hungary (1040‚Äì1095), King of Hungary *W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman (c. 1040‚Äì1102), Duke of Poland *W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile (1105‚Äì1159), Duke of Silesia, sometimes known as Ladislaus I the Exile *Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia (-1174), who reigned as King Vladislaus I of Bohemia *Vladislav I of Serbia, King of Serbia (1234-1243) *Ladislaus I of Opole (1246‚Äì1281), Duke of Opole *Wladislaus I of Oswiecim (c. 1314 ‚Äì c. 1321), Duke of O≈õwiƒôcim *W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high (1261‚Äì1333), King of Poland (also known as Ladislaus the Short, or W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek) *Vladislav I of Wallachia (died 1377), Prince of Wallachia (also known as Vlaicu-VodƒÉ) *Ladislaus I of Naples (1377‚Äì1411), King of Naples  See also  * Ladislaus (disambiguation) * Ladislaus I of Poland (disambiguation) ","title":"Ladislaus I"},{"id":"2424001","text":"Haven High Academy (formerly Haven High Technology College and Haven High School) is a secondary school with academy status located on Marian Road in the north of Boston, Lincolnshire, England.

History The \\"Royal\\" in the title comes from the Royal Charters that were granted in 1667, by King Charles II of England, and in 1692, by King William III and Queen Mary II of England. It was known as the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland until 1890 when, under charter of Queen Victoria, it adopted the present title. The College was founded in 1654 by John Stearne, a professor and registrar of Trinity College, Dublin, for the purpose of regulating the practice of medicine in Ireland. Originally, it was called \\"The Fraternity of Physicians of Trinity Hall\\", as its first home was in a building called Trinity Hall, given to the Physicians by Trinity College. The Royal Charter of 1692 made the Physicians independent of Trinity College but meant that they had to leave Trinity Hall. They then had no permanent home until the opening of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital in 1812, when the College established its headquarters in some rooms in the hospital.Heritage Center, The Royal College of Physicians of IrelandDun's Library at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland In 1860, the College purchased the premises of the Kildare Street Club in Kildare Street. The building was destroyed in a fire in November 1860 and subsequently rebuilt by the College to its own design. It opened in 1864 and has remained the College's home ever since. The College Library dates its foundation to 1713 when Sir Patrick Dun bequeathed his personal, large library to the College. The Library has been known as \\"Dun's Library\\" ever since. The Dun's Library forms part of the College's Heritage Centre, with the archive, heritage items and genealogical research collections. The Heritage Centre holds one of the most important and extensive collections of printed, manuscript material and items relating to the history of medicine and medical education in Ireland. Presidents Among the famous past presidents of the College were William Fetherstone Montgomery, Sir Patrick Dun (1681‚Äì93), Henry Marsh (1841), Robert James Graves (1843), William Stokes (1849), and Sir Dominic Corrigan (1859‚Äì1863). James Little (1837‚Äì1916), who was president from 1886 to 1888, had worked as a ship's surgeon early in his career. He survived the shipwreck of the SS Ava in 1858, which is recorded in his diary, now held in the college's archives.

The wing helps maintain, repair and fly the same aircraft as its active-duty counterparts. Members of the 512th work side- by-side with members of the 436th Airlift Wing in fulfilling the mission, maintaining and flying the Lockheed C-5M Galaxy and Boeing C-17 Globemaster III working together to form the \\"Dover Team\\". As one of only two reserve associate units flying the Galaxy, the 512 AW has a unique role in the Air Force. The first C-5 all-reserve aircrew flew out of Dover in November 1973. Mission Recruit, train, equip and retain a qualified force to augment major commands with people and units to support strategic aircraft during peace and war. Units The 512th Airlift Wing consists of the following major units: ; 512th Operations Group *709th Airlift Squadron ‚Äì C-5M Super Galaxy *326th Airlift Squadron ‚Äì C-17A Globemaster III * 512th Maintenance Group * 512th Mission Support Group * 512th Aerospace Medicine Squadron History =Activation and mobilization for the Korean War= The wing was first organized at Reading Municipal Airport on 2 September 1949 as the 512th Troop Carrier Wing, when it absorbed the personnel and equipment of the 319th Bombardment Wing, which was inactivated. A few months later, in April 1950, reserve operations at Reading ended when the wing transferred to New Castle County Airport, Delaware. The wing was manned at 25% of normal strength but was authorized four flying squadrons rather than the three of active duty units.Cantwell, p. 74 In March of the following year the wing, along with all reserve combat units, was mobilized for the first time for the Korean War. Its personnel were assigned to other units as fillers,Cantwell, p. 97 as were its aircraft,Cantwell, p. 137 and the wing was inactivated two weeks later. =Troop carrier operations= In June 1952, the 512th Troop Carrier Wing was again activated in the reserve at New Castle County Airport, replacing the 916th Reserve Training Wing and taking over the 916th's personnel. The reserve mobilization for the Korean War, however, had left the Reserve without aircraft, and the unit did not receive aircraft until July 1952.Cantwell, p. 139 512th aircrews flew Curtiss C-46 Commandos throughout the periods of reserve and active status. In the summer of 1956, the wing participated in Operation Sixteen Ton during its two weeks of active duty training. Sixteen Ton was performed entirely by reserve troop carrier units and moved United States Coast Guard equipment From Floyd Bennett Naval Air Station to Isla Grande Airport in Puerto Rico and San Salvador in the Bahamas. After the success of this operation, the squadron/group/wing began to use inactive duty training periods for Operation Swift Lift, transporting high priority cargo for the air force and Operation Ready Swap, transporting aircraft engines, between Air Materiel Command's depots.Cantwell, pp. 149‚Äì150 Cuts in the budget in 1957 led to a reduction in the number of reserve squadrons from 55 to 45.Cantwell, pp. 168‚Äì169 In November, the wing's 328th Troop Carrier Squadron moved on paper to Paine Air Force Base, Washington, where it assumed the facilities that the 65th Troop Carrier Squadron had vacated there.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 20, 247‚Äì248 The 328th Squadron's stay on the West Coast was brief, for it replaced the 64th Troop Carrier Squadron at Niagara Falls Municipal Airport the following March.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 20, 245 The moves of the 328th Squadron were not only due to budget cuts, they were part of a reserve program called the Detached Squadron Concept. The Air Force believed that the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning. In time, the detached squadron program proved successful in attracting additional participantsCantwell, p. 156 Also in 1957, the wing converted to Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars. After that transition, the wing transferred to Willow Grove Air Reserve Station, Pennsylvania in July 1958. In April 1959, the 512th Troop Carrier Group inactivated as the wing reorganized under the Dual Deputy system, and the wing's three troop carrier squadrons were reassigned directly to the wing. =Activation of groups under the wing= Although the dispersal of flying units was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization, which included the 512th Wing, occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the units being released on 22 November 1962. The formation of troop carrier groups was delayed until February 1963 for wings that had been mobilized.Cantwell, pp. 189‚Äì191 912th and 913th Troop Carrier Groups at Willow Grove and the 914th Troop Carrier Group at Niagara Falls were assigned to the wing on 11 February. The 512th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium was redesignated the 512th Troop Carrier Wing, Heavy in January 1965. That same month the wing was transferred without personnel or equipment to Carswell Air Force Base, Texas. Aircrews conducted training and airlift operations in Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs. While stationed at Carswell, two more name changes occurred: 1 December 1965, the Wing was redesignated the 512th Air Transport Wing, Heavy and on 1 January 1966, was redesignated the 512th Military Airlift Wing. On 29 June 1971, the Wing was inactivated for a second time. On 29 January 1973 the wing was redesignated the 512th Military Airlift Wing (Associate) and activated in the Reserve on 1 July 1973 at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware flying the Lockheed C-5A Galaxy aircraft. Upon activation at Dover, the 512th absorbed the personnel of the 912th Military Airlift Group (Associate) stationed at Dover. The 912th Military Airlift Group (Associate) previously assigned to the 514th Military Airlift Wing, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, for administrative support, but stationed at Willow Grove moved from Willow Grove to Dover in September 1968. Equipped with Lockheed C-141 Starlifter aircraft, the 912th became the third associate group in the Air Force Reserve to fly the C-141. The wing was redesignated the 512th Airlift Wing on 1 October 1994. simulate first response treatment of a Delaware Civil Air Patrol cadet during a training exercise 2 November 2014, at Dover Air Force Base. Many missions have been flown by the citizen airman of the 512th Airlift Wing. Over 1,300 members of the 512th were recalled to active duty during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Fliers, Maintenance Specialists, Aerial Porters, Medical Personnel, and Security Police were deployed around the world as well as stateside for more than a year. In 2007, the wing began a new era in airlift when the 326th Airlift Squadron began flying the McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III aircraft when it received their first C-17 on 31 May 2007.

Louis XV was so well pleased that he allowed him to pass the examinations for the licentiate without the required delays, a privilege, however, which de la Molette did not use. Later on, he became Vicar-General of the diocese of Vienne, France.

The work, written in 1132 or soon after, is one of the first autobiographical works in medieval Western Europe, written in the form of a letter (and, as such, is clearly influenced by Augustine of Hippo's Confessions). The letter is an extensive and honest self-analysis of Abelard up to the age of about fifty- four, and provides readers with knowledge of his views of women, learning, monastic life, Church and State combined, and the social milieu of the time. It should be particularly noted that the work was written at a time when Western Europe had only recently surfaced into the world of philosophy. Abelard emphasizes how persecuted he feels by his peers throughout the work. He quotes saints, apostles, and at one point, compares his struggles in likeness to those of Christ.

Geography The Wolds comprise a series of low hills and steep valleys underlain by calcareous (chalk and limestone) and sandstone rock, laid down in the Cretaceous period. The characteristic open valleys of the Wolds were created during the last glacial period through the action of glaciation and meltwater. The chalk that underlies the Chalk Wolds Landscape Character Type extends from the Yorkshire Wolds to the south coast of England, in East Sussex and in Dorset. Geologically, the Lincolnshire Wolds is a continuation of the Yorkshire Wolds which runs through the East Riding of Yorkshire; the point at which the ranges of hill crosses the Humber is known as the Humber Gap.

It also hosts a six-week summer festival of modern dance performances, currently held at Duke University and the Durham Performing Arts Center in Durham, North Carolina. Several site-specific performances have also taken place outdoors at Duke Gardens and the NC Art Museum in Raleigh, NC.  History  In 1934 the Bennington Festival was established as a summer program at Bennington College where modern dance pioneers Hanya Holm, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman came together to teach dance technique and perform new works. For one year, in 1939, Bennington moved the program to Mills College in Oakland, California, but it was back in Vermont by 1940. It ceased to exist after the summer of 1942. In 1948, a program based on the Bennington model was established at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut and called the New York University ‚Äì Connecticut College School of Dance / American Dance Festival. In 1969, newly appointed director Charles Reinhart shortened the name to, simply, the American Dance Festival. After 30 years at the Connecticut College campus, the festival moved, in 1978, to the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Since its founding in 1934, The American Dance Festival has been the home to over six hundred and forty premieres, more than three hundred and forty commissions, and over fifty reconstructions by artists such as Martha Graham, Jos√© Lim√≥n, Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Alvin Ailey, Twyla Tharp, Pilobolus, Meredith Monk, Martha Clarke, and many more. Charles Reinhert was the director of the American Dance Festival from 1969-2011. In January 2012 Jodee Nimerichter was appointed director after having been a co-director with Charles from 2007-2011, and Associate Director from 2003-2007.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/arts/dance/american-dance- festival-charles-reinhart-tribute-review.html Modern dance choreographers and companies who have given performances or taught there include Jos√© Lim√≥n, Pearl Lang, Bella Lewitzky, Sophie Maslow, Alwin Nikolais, Merce Cunningham, Ruth Currier, Erick Hawkins, Paul Taylor, Alvin Ailey, Twyla Tharp, Betty Jones, Paul Draper, William Bales, Eiko & Koma, Justin Tornow, Se√°n Curran, Wang Ramirez, Maguy Marin, Pilobolus and Anne Teresa De KeersmaekerRIOULT DANCE NY, Lines Ballet Company, Shen Wei Dance Arts, LMNO3, Heidi Latsky Dance, Bill T.

The largest theater in the Carolinas, the Durham Performing Arts Center, was built partly as a showcase for the festival. In 2016, the American Dance Festival with support from the Doris Duke/SHS Foundations Award for New Dances, commissioned Pascal Rioult's Cassandra's Curse with music by Richard Danielpour. ADF has given scholarships and awards out to accomplished dance figures. The Scholarship is entitled the Samuel H. Scripps/American Dance Festival Award and is $50,000 given to one distinguished choreographer per year. These recipients include Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Ohad Naharin, Pina Bausch, Twyla Tharp, Jose Limon, and others. ADF also awards distinguished dance teachers. This award is entitled the Balasaraswati/Joy Anne Dewey Beinecke Endowed Chair for Distinguished Teaching. Recipients of this award include Gerri Houlihan, Gus Solomons Jr., Donna Faye Burchield, Jacylnn Villamil, Irene Dowd and others. The American Dance Festival also offers internships during their summer session for both Arts Administration and Production. Interns are able to take one dance class per day and then the remainder of their day is filled with working in the ADF offices for those interested in Arts Administration, or learning the tools and skills of stage hand work and spending 40+ in the theater by being on the crew for every professional company throughout the festival. Both internships include a full tuition scholarship to the Six Week school. Applicants must apply for these internships, and selection is very competitive. The American Dance Festival also offers classes year round in the Samuel H. Scripps Studio. The Studios offer classes for all ages and levels throughout the calendar year. During the summer session, the studio is used throughout the Six Week School in addition to spaces provided from Duke University. In addition to the summer sessions and year-round programs based in Durham, NC, ADF also hosts a Winter Intensive in both New York City and Pasadena, CA.

Early years Tobey was born in 1917 in Oakland, California. Following his graduation from high school in 1935, Kenneth entered the University of California, Berkeley with intentions to pursue a career in law until he began to dabble in acting at the school's theater. His stage experience there led to a drama scholarship, a year-and-a-half of study at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse, where his classmates included fellow actors Gregory Peck, Eli Wallach, and Tony Randall. \\"Kenneth Tobey Probably Has Reddest Hair in the World\\". Retrieved May 24, 2017. During World War II, Tobey joined the United States Army Air Forces, serving in the Pacific as a rear gunner aboard a B-25 bomber. Throughout the 1940s, with the exception of his time in military service, Tobey acted on Broadway and in summer stock. After appearing in a 1943 film short, The Man of the Ferry, he made his Hollywood film debut in the 1947 Hopalong Cassidy western Dangerous Venture. He then went on to appear in scores of features and on numerous television series. In the 1949 film Twelve O' Clock High, he is the negligent airbase sentry who is dressed down by General Frank Savage (played by Gregory Peck). That same year Tobey performed in a brief comedy bit in another film, I Was a Male War Bride. His performance in that minor part caught the attention of director Howard Hawks, who promised to use the thirty-two-year-old actor in something more substantial. The Thing from Another World In 1951, Tobey was cast in Howard Hawks' production The Thing from Another World. In this classic sci-fi film he portrays Captain Patrick Hendry, a United States Air Force pilot, who at the North Pole leads a scientific outpost's dogged defense against an alien portrayed by James Arness, later the star of the television series Gunsmoke. Tobey's performance in Hawks' film garnered the actor other parts in science fiction movies in the 1950s, usually reprising his role as a military officer, such as in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and It Came from Beneath the Sea (1956). Television Tobey appeared in the 1952 episode \\"Counterfeit Plates\\" on the CBS series Biff Baker, U.S.A., an espionage drama starring Alan Hale, Jr. He was cast too in the 1954-1955 CBS legal drama The Public Defender, starring Reed Hadley. He guest-starred in three episodes of NBC's western anthology series Frontier. His Frontier roles were as Wade Trippe in \\"In Nebraska\\" (1955) and then as Gabe Sharp in \\"Out from Texas\\" and \\"The Hostage\\" (1956). In 1955, he also portrayed legendary frontiersman Jim Bowie on ABC's Davy Crockett, a Walt Disney production, with Fess Parker in the title role. After Bowie's death in the series at the Battle of the Alamo, Tobey played a second character, Jocko, in the two final episodes of Davy Crockett. Tobey then, in 1957, appeared in the syndicated religion anthology series Crossroads in the role of Mr. Alston in the episode \\"Call for Help\\" and as Jim Callahan in \\"Bandit Chief\\" in the syndicated western series The Sheriff of Cochise. Later that same year, Tobey starred in the television series The Whirlybirds, a successful CBS and then-syndicated adventure produced by Desilu Studios. In it he played the co-owner of a helicopter charter service, along with fellow actor Craig Hill. The Whirlybirds was a major hit in the United States and abroad, with 111 episodes filmed through 1960. It remained in syndication worldwide for many years. In 1958, Tobey also appeared as John Wallach in the episode \\"$50 for a Dead Man\\" in Jeff Richards's NBC western series Jefferson Drum. In 1960, he guest-starred in the episode \\"West of Boston\\" of another NBC western series, Overland Trail, starring William Bendix and Doug McClure. Also in 1960, he appeared as Colonel Lake on Death Valley Days and on ABC's western The Rebel, starring Nick Adams. Tobey made three guest appearances on Perry Mason, twice in 1960 and once in 1962 as Jack Alvin, a deputy district attorney. On the long-running western series Gunsmoke, he portrayed a cruel, knife-wielding buffalo hunter in the 1960 episode titled \\"The Worm\\".\\"Popular Videos-Gunsmoke\\", episode S06E08 [\\"The Worm\\"], originally broadcast October 29, 1960. Full episode available for viewing on YouTube, a subsidiary of Amazon, Seattle, Washington. Retrieved January 31, 2019. Tobey in 1962 also guest-starred on another Western series, Lawman, playing the character Duncan Clooney, an engineer who seeks to move a shipment of nitroglycerin through Laramie, Wyoming. When the town is evacuated to allow passage of the explosives, two of Clooney's employees decide they will take advantage of the situation to rob the bank. Tobey guest-starred as well in Jack Lord's 1962-1963 ABC adventure series about a rodeo circuit rider, Stoney Burke. In 1967 he performed on the series Lassie, in the episode \\"Lure of the Wild\\", playing a retired forest ranger who tames a local coyote. He also appeared as a slave owner named Taggart in \\"The Wolf Man\\", a 1967 episode of Daniel Boone, starring Fess Parker.\\"The Wolf Man\\", Daniel Boone episode S03E18, originally broadcast January 26, 1967. Full episode available for viewing on YouTube. Retrieved May 23, 2017. A few of the many other series in which Tobey later performed include Adam-12 (1969), Gibbsville (1976), MV Klickitat (1978), Emergency! (1975), and Night Court (1985). Tobey also appeared in Barnaby Jones; episode titled, \\"Fantasy of Fear\\" (02/25/1975). He became a semi- regular on the NBC series I Spy as the field boss of agents Robinson and Scott. Christian Nyby, director of The Thing From Another World, often directed those episodes. Tobey also portrayed a ship's captain on the Rockford Files, in an episode titled \\"There's One in Every Port\\". Other films In 1957, Tobey portrayed a sheriff in The Vampire (a film that some sources today often confuse with the 1935 production Mark of the Vampire). That year he also appeared in a more prestigious film, serving as a featured supporting character with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, the co-stars of John Ford's The Wings of Eagles.Wings of Eagles , American Film Institute (AFI) catalog; production details, cast and crew, and plot summary. Retrieved May 26, 2017. In that film, Tobey‚Äîwith his naturally red hair on display in vibrant Metrocolor‚Äîportrays a highly competitive United States Army Air Service officer. In one memorable scene he has the distinction of shoving a piece of gooey cake into the face of John Wayne, whose character is a rival United States Navy aviation officer. Not surprisingly, a room-wrecking brawl ensues. Tobey's work over the next several decades was increasingly involved in television productions. He did, though, continue to perform in a range of feature films, such as Stark Fear, Marlowe, Billy Jack, Walking Tall, The Howling, the war movie MacArthur (in which he portrays Admiral \\"Bill\\"[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Vol. V, Pg. 183f] Halsey), Airplane!, Gremlins, Big Top Pee-wee, and Gremlins 2: The New Batch.\\"Kenneth Tobey\\", AFI catalog, filmography. Retrieved May 26, 2017. Broadway Although Tobey had a busy acting career in films and on television, he also periodically returned to the stage. In 1964 he began a long run on Broadway opposite Sammy Davis, Jr., in the musical version of Clifford Odets' play Golden Boy. Some of his other Broadway credits are As You Like It, Sunny River, Janie, Sons and Soldiers, A New Life, Suds in Your Eye, The Cherry Orchard, and Truckline Cafe. Later years As his long career drew to a close, Tobey still received acting jobs from people who had grown up watching his performances in sci-fi films of the 1950s, particularly Joe Dante, who included the veteran actor in his stock company of reliable players. Two appearances on the sitcom Night Court came the same way, through fans of his work. Along with other character actors who had been in 1950s sci-fi and horror films (John Agar, Robert O. Cornthwaite, Gloria Talbott, etc.), Tobey starred in a spoof originally titled Attack Of The B Movie Monster. In 2005, Anthem Pictures released the completed feature version of this spoof on DVD under the new title The Naked Monster. Tobey's scenes in that release were actually shot in 1985, so The Naked Monster is technically his final film credit, being released three years after his death. He had, however, continued to act throughout most of the 1990s. One of those notable roles is his performance in the 1994 Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Shadowplay\\" as Rurigan, an alien who recreates his dead friends as holograms. Among other examples of Tobey's final decade of work are his two appearances as Judge Kent Watson on the series L.A. Law. In 2002, Tobey died of natural causes at age 85 in Rancho Mirage, California.

On June 29, 1892https://www.clarin.com/policiales/masacre-necochea-origen-huellas- digitales_0_HJ2vRGa8.html, 27-year-old Rojas murdered her two children in Necochea, Buenos Aires Province, in Argentina. Her six-year-old son, Ponciano Carballo Rojas, and his four-year-old sister Teresa were found brutally murdered in their home. Francisca tried to simulate an attack by cutting her own throat and then blaming the murders on her neighbor Pedro Ram√≥n Vel√°zquez. The report of the murder did not reach La Plata (the provincial capital) until July 8. Police Inspector Alvarez, of the Central Police, was sent to Necochea to assist local police with the investigation. When he arrived, he found police had no leads. Rojas denied having anything to do with the children's deaths. Vel√°zquez also explicitly denied killing the children. Alvarez quickly determined that Vel√°zquez had an alibi, having been out with several friends at the time of the murders. Alvarez also learned that Rojas' other boyfriend had been overheard saying he would marry her \\"except for those two brats\\". Alvarez examined the scene even though it was several days old. After some time, he discovered a brown mark on a bedroom door, which (after careful exam) he determined to be a bloody fingerprint. Remembering the training he received from Juan Vucetich, Alvarez removed the section of the door with the impression and returned to La Plata with the evidence. Alvarez then requested Rojas be fingerprinted. Once completed, he compared the impression on the door to that of Rojas and individualized it to her. When confronted with this evidence, Rojas broke down and confessed to the murders. She was subsequently convicted. When Alvarez returned to La Plata with the fingerprint evidence, Vucetich's faith in fingerprints was proven. The case laid the groundwork in proving the superiority of fingerprints for personal identification purposes as compared to anthropometry. As a result of the Rojas murders, Argentina became the first country in the world to abolish anthropometry and file its criminal records based solely on fingerprint classification. His resulting classification system is still used in many South American countries today.

It runs a meet that consists of about 70 racing days from early May to mid-September, generally holding scheduled races Thursday through Sunday, with racing added on several holidays throughout the meet. The track itself features a oval dirt track and a turf course. Outside seating is available along with several indoor seating options. The track runs multiple food stands and bars throughout the building and simulcast betting is also offered. Canterbury Park has hosted the Claiming Crown of horse racing for all but four years since its inception in 1999. The inaugural Mystic Lake Derby, offering the largest purse at the track since 1991, was run on July 28, 2012. The race was won by the 3-year-old Hammers Terror in a time of 1:37.18 over the one mile turf event. The park also includes a card club. A two-week series of poker tournaments, Fall Poker Classic, is held each fall at Canterbury Park. History Canterbury Park at night Canterbury Downs was founded by Walter Brooks Fields, Jr., and other investors. According to David Miller of the Daily Racing Form, \\"Fields, along with his nephew Brooks Hauser, formed Minnesota Racetrack Inc. after a constitutional amendment allowing parimutuel wagering on horse racing was approved by Minnesota voters in 1982. Naming Santa Anita as its primary partner, Minnesota Racetrack Inc. was awarded the state's first racetrack license by the Minnesota Racing Commission and the facility in Shakopee held its first race on June 26, 1985. The introduction of the state's lottery and the widespread growth of casino gaming at Native American-hosted facilities in the area saw Canterbury Downs business repeatedly fall below revenue projections, and the track was sold in 1990 to Ladbroke Racing PLC.\\" In 1990, Canterbury was bought by Ladbroke Racing Corporation and was renamed New Canterbury Downs. In December 1992, it closed its doors after a disastrous live racing season that saw an enormous drop in attendance. In late 1993, Canterbury was bought by Irwin L. Jacobs, who quickly sold it to Curtis and Randy Sampson. Shortly after the sale, the Sampsons worked to revitalize Canterbury, so that it reopened its doors to simulcasting, and it quickly removed itself from debt. In late 1994, Canterbury carried through on a promise to return live horse racing to Minnesota. In January 1995, Canterbury Downs officially changed its name to Canterbury Park. In 1999 the legislature authorized a card room with poker tables at Canterbury Park. This had the effect of allowing poker tables at the state's Indian tribe casinos as well. Due to the 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown, Canterbury was forced to close. Ramsey County District Judge Kathleen Gearin rejected a court case by the owners of Canterbury to reopen it. Canterbury Park reopened on July 20, 2011 when the government shutdown ended. In June 2012 Canterbury Park and the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, owners and operators of Mystic Lake Casino, announced a 10-year cooperative marketing and purse enhancement agreement that will add $75 million to horsemen purses over the life of the agreement. Not only does Canterbury Park host thoroughbred and quarter horse races, due to creative marketing, they host Corgi Dog Races, Wiener Dog Races, and the annual Running of the Bulldogs. Current staff members include KFAN Radio Personality and Vikings Announcer, Paul Allen, and FOX Sports North Commentator, Kevin Gorg. In 2019, Canterbury Park was the site of the Twin Cities Summer Jam.

It is also a platform for social exchange, and is potentially linked to other books and other discussions. wikipedia can be considered a networked book. Characteristics The networked book has four primary characteristics: *The Networked Book is an Open Book *The Networked Book is Structurally Granular or Disaggregated *The Networked Book is Social *The Networked Book is Processed =Open book= The networked book maintains an open structure during all or part of its creation. For example, Lawrence Lessig's, Code: Version 2.0 used a wiki to open the editing process for the second edition of Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, in order to \\"draw upon the creativity and knowledge of the community. This is an online, collaborative book update; a first of its kind. Once the project nears completion, Professor Lessig will take the contents of this wiki and ready it for publication.\\" In other words, at some point the book was declared finished, and closed to further input and adjustment by the community. Another example of an open book structure is the popular wikipedia. This online wiki encyclopedia is entirely and indefinitely open. Another example of a networked book is Turbulence.org's 2009 commissioned anthology, Networked: a (networked book) about (networked art). The website explores writing, art, and culture in networked society, and explores the subject on multiple levels. In addition to the thematic matter, the initial commissioned authors were invited to submit chapters using a blog or wiki format. While seven of the authors chose the blog format (with the CommentPress plugin), artist/theorist Patrick Lichty created a wiki-formatted chapter, \\"Art in the Age of Dataflow\\", which discusses literary theories of spatial narrative from its inception in the 1940s to the age of big data. Like Lawrence Lessig's text, Dataflow was intended as a propositional text from which the online community expand on the original chapter. The chapter as it existed in 2012 was captured and included in Lichty's Institute for Networked Culture book, \\"Variant Analyses, Interrogations of New Media Art and Culture\\". =Structurally granular or disaggregated= The networked book manifests a certain \\"disarticulation of the body of text\\" and \\"disaggregated/reaggregated\\" structure as described by Raffaele Simone in his essay, The Body of the Text. \\"Disarticulation of the body of the text occurs when the text generated by an author is not perceived as closed to external interventions, an entity to which the author can have access only to read (or, to use an information science image, in the manner of ROM, that is \\"read only\\"), but as an open entity to which one has access‚Äîfor purposes of both reading and writing. When the text is disarticulated it is perceived as an entity which can be disaggregated (broken apart), manipulated, and reaggregated (reassembled) without damaging the text per se or the author.\\" The networked book is a form that helps us reconstruct and understand the prolific and increasingly granular world of information that surrounds us. Moreover, the networked book sets up formats that are often designed to update continually, incorporating new information and reconfiguring the book to accommodate new content and present it coherently. Jonathan Harris' 10 x 10 builds its content from RSS feeds. The piece selects the most frequently used words from the major news networks to assemble an hourly \\"portrait\\" of our world. This visualization tool represents a type of structure that we will soon see in networked books. The human editor/programmer creates the search and visualization function and the machine then collects, edits, and presents text and images according to criteria built into the program. This type of \\"book\\" format depends on granular content that can be \\"manipulated and reaggregated\\" by a tool. =Social= Social software environments create spaces for communal authorship. They allow raw, unedited content to be collectively assembled within the nascent form of the electronic book itself, facilitating a gestational space for content to evolve from spontaneous discussion into an edited \\"book\\" according to the activity of the social network. LiveJournal is a useful model for socially networked books.See also McKenzie Wark's GAM3R 7H30RY 1.1, an open book experiment produced by the Institute for the Future of the Book. The multiple-author forum creates a different kind of thinking environment. Individual points of view are mediated by multiple voices. This may allow for a more democratic approach to issues and a multifaceted rendering of topics not possible in the single-author print model. =Processed= The future book will be a networked book or a \\"processed book\\" as Joseph Esposito calls it. To process a book, he says, is more than simply building links to it; processing also includes a modification of the act of creation, which tends to encourage the absorption of the book into a network of applications, including but not restricted to commentary. This \\"processing\\" creates iterations of the book: critiques, revisions and trajectories that accumulate around the original draft. The iterations of wikipedia are a good example of this principle. The networked book, as a process-based knowledge machine incorporates the thinking process of multiple authors. Processing the networked book It is useful, in this case, to compare the processing of a networked book to the standard editorial procedures found in print culture. Both print books and networked books originate from an idea conceived by a senior editor or an author. However, the participatory framework of a networked book is articulated by a designer, and executed by a programmer, before the content is written or assembled, thus creating an open book structure. Paper-based books are turned over to the designer, production artist and printer after the content is finished, resulting in a closed book structure. The networked book is assembled, in whole or in part, by a community of authors according to the thesis imagined by the editor/author and within the space created by the designer and programmer. The community of contributors acts as both author and reader, which is drastically different from the single-author print model wherein, reader is audience rather than co-creator. In a networked book, content is generated and revised by the community and the various iterations of the text are often saved and can be returned to and discussed. In a paper-based book, content is generally constructed by a single author and is revised under the supervision of an editor. The readers have no part in this process and the revisions are only examined and debated in special cases, and then usually by scholars or authors, not by the general readership. After the content has been generated by the community within the framework of the network book's thesis and architecture, the reader/editor implements strategies for marking out meaningful pathways through the material using search engines and visualization applications.

These are pairs of single Unicode code points that are canonically equivalent. The reason for this are compatibility issues with legacy systems. Unless two characters are canonically equivalent, they are not \\"duplicate\\" in the narrow sense. There is, however, room for disagreement on whether two Unicode characters really encode the same grapheme in cases such as the \\"micro sign\\" ¬µ vs. the Greek Œº. This should be clearly distinguished from Unicode characters that are rendered as identical glyphs or near-identical glyphs (homoglyphs), either because they are historically cognate (such as Greek Œó vs. Latin H) or because of coincidental similarity (such as Greek Œ° vs. Latin P, or Greek Œó vs. Cyrillic –ù, or the following homoglyphs quadruplet: astronomical symbol for \\"Sun\\" ‚òâ, \\"circled dot operator\\" ‚äô, the Gothic letter êçà, the IPA symbol for a bilabial click ). Duplicate vs. derived character Unicode aims at encoding graphemes, not individual \\"meanings\\" (\\"semantics\\") of graphemes, and not glyphs. It is a matter of case-by-case judgement whether such characters should receive separate encoding when used in technical contexts, e.g. Greek letters used as mathematical symbols: thus, the choice to have a \\"micro- sign\\" ¬µ separate from Greek Œº, but not a \\"Mega sign\\" separate from Latin M was a pragmatic decision by Unicode consortium for historical reasons (compatibility with Latin-1 which included a micro sign). Technically ¬µ and Œº are not duplicate characters in that the consortium viewed these symbols as distinct characters (while it regarded M for \\"Mega\\" and Latin M as one and the same character). Note that merely having different \\"meanings\\" is not sufficient grounds to split a grapheme into several characters: Thus, the acute accent may represent word accent in Welsh or Swedish, it may express vowel quality in French, and it may express vowel length in Hungarian, Icelandic or Irish. Since all these languages are written in the same script, namely Latin script, the acute accent in its various meanings is considered one and the same combining diacritic character (U+0301), as well as the accented letter √© is the same character in French and Hungarian. There is a separate \\"combining diacritic acute tone mark\\" at U+0341 for the romanization of tone languages, one important difference between the two being that in a language like French, the acute accent can replace the dot over the lowercase i, whereas in a language like Vietnamese, the acute tone mark is added above the dot. Diacritic signs for alphabets considered independent may be encoded separately, such as the acute (\\"tonos\\") for the Greek alphabet at U+0384, and for the Armenian alphabet at U+055B. Some Cyrillic-based alphabets (such as Russian) also use the acute accent, but there is no \\"Cyrillic acute\\" encoded separately and U+301 should be used for Cyrillic as well as Latin (see Cyrillic characters in Unicode). The point that the same grapheme can have many \\"meanings\\" is even more obvious considering e.g. the letter U, which has entirely different phonemic referents in the various languages that use it in their orthographies (English etc., French , German , etc., not to mention various uses of U as a symbol). Compatibility issues =CJK fullwidth forms= In traditional Chinese character encodings, characters usually took either a single byte (known as halfwidth) or two bytes (known as fullwidth). Characters that took a single byte were generally displayed at half the width of those that took two bytes. Some characters such as the Latin alphabet were available in both halfwidth and fullwidth versions. As the halfwidth versions were more commonly used, they were generally the ones mapped to the standard code points for those characters. Therefore a separate section was needed for the fullwidth forms to preserve the distinction. Letterlike symbols In some cases, specific graphemes have acquired a specialized symbolic or technical meaning separate from their original function. A prominent example is the Greek letter œÄ which is widely recognized as the symbol for the mathematical constant of a circle's circumference divided by its diameter even by people not literate in Greek. Several variants of the entire Greek and Latin alphabets specifically for use as mathematical symbols are encoded in the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols range. This range disambiguates characters that would usually be considered font variants but are encoded separately because of widespread use of font variants (e.g. L vs. \\"script L\\" vs. \\"blackletter L\\" vs. \\"boldface blackletter L\\" ) as distinctive mathematical symbols. It is intended for use only in mathematical or technical notation, not use in non-technical text.Draft Unicode Technical Report #25 =Greek= Many Greek letters are used as technical symbols. All of the Greek letters are encoded in the Greek section of Unicode but many are encoded a second time under the name of the technical symbol they represent. The \\"micro sign\\" (U+00B5, ¬µ) is obviously inherited from ISO 8859-1, but the origin of the others is less clear. Other Greek glyph variants encoded as separate characters include the lunate sigma œπ œ≤ contrasting with Œ£ œÉ, final sigma œÇ (strictly speaking a contextual glyph variant) contrasting with œÉ, The Qoppa numeral symbol œû œü contrasting with archaic œò œô. Greek letters assigned separate \\"symbol\\" codepoints include the Letterlike Symbols œê, œµ, œë, œñ, œ±, œí, and œï (contrasting with Œ≤, Œµ, Œ∏, œÄ, œÅ, Œ•, œÜ); the Ohm symbol Œ© (contrasting with Œ©); and the mathematical operators for the product ‚àè and sum ‚àë (contrasting with Œ† and Œ£). =Roman numerals= Unicode has a number of characters specifically designated as Roman numerals, as part of the Number Forms range from U+2160 to U+2183. For example, Roman 1988 (MCMLXXXVIII) could alternatively be written as ‚ÖØ‚Ö≠‚ÖØ‚Ö¨‚Ö©‚Ö©‚Ö©‚Öß. This range includes both upper- and lowercase numerals, as well as pre-combined glyphs for numbers up to 12 (‚Ö´ for XII), mainly intended for clock faces. The pre-combined glyphs should only be used to represent the individual numbers where the use of individual glyphs is not wanted, and not to replace compounded numbers. For example, one can combine ‚Ö© with ‚Ö† to mean Roman numeral eleven (‚Ö©‚Ö†), so U+216A (‚Ö™) is canonically equivalent to ‚Ö©‚Ö†. Such characters are also referred to as composite compatibility characters or decomposable compatibility characters. Such characters would not normally have been included within the Unicode standard except for compatibility with other existing encodings (see Unicode compatibility characters). The goal was to accommodate simple translation from existing encodings into Unicode. This makes translations in the opposite direction complicated because multiple Unicode characters may map to a single character in another encoding. Without the compatibility concerns the only characters necessary would be: ‚Ö†, ‚Ö§, ‚Ö©, ‚Ö¨, ‚Ö≠, ‚ÖÆ, ‚ÖØ, ‚Ö∞, ‚Ö¥, ‚Öπ, ‚Öº, ‚ÖΩ, ‚Öæ, ‚Öø, ‚ÜÄ, ‚ÜÅ, ‚ÜÇ, ‚Üá, ‚Üà, and ‚ÜÉ; all other Roman numerals can be composed from these.

It is an important biochemical metabolite in plants and microorganisms. Its name comes from the Japanese flower shikimi (, the Japanese star anise, Illicium anisatum), from which it was first isolated in 1885 by Johan Fredrik Eykman. The elucidation of its structure was made nearly 50 years later.  Properties  It appears in the list of Group 3 carcinogens of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Group 3 means that the agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. Nevertheless, it is recommended to roast tree fern fronds, a specialty called fiddlehead (furled fronds of a young tree fern in the order Cyatheales, harvested for use as a vegetable). These fronds are edible, but must be roasted first to remove shikimic acid. Shikimic acid is also the glycoside part of some hydrolysable tannins. The acid is highly soluble in water and insoluble in nonpolar solvents, and this is why shikimic acid is active only against Gram-positive bacteria, due to outer cell membrane impermeability of Gram-negatives.  Biosynthesis  Phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate react to form 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP), in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme DAHP synthase. DAHP is then transformed to 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ), in a reaction catalyzed by DHQ synthase. Although this reaction requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a cofactor, the enzymic mechanism regenerates it, resulting in the net use of no NAD. :Biosynthesis of 3-dehydroquinate from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate DHQ is dehydrated to 3-dehydroshikimic acid by the enzyme 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, which is reduced to shikimic acid by the enzyme shikimate dehydrogenase, which uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor. :Biosynthesis of shikimic acid from 3-dehydroquinate  Shikimate pathway  =Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids= The shikimate pathway is a seven-step metabolic route used by bacteria, fungi, algae, parasites, and plants for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan). This pathway is not found in animals; therefore, phenylalanine and tryptophan represent essential amino acids that must be obtained from the animal's diet (animals can synthesise tyrosine from phenylalanine, and therefore is not an essential amino acid except for individuals unable to hydroxylate phenylalanine to tyrosine). The seven enzymes involved in the shikimate pathway are DAHP synthase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, shikimate dehydrogenase, shikimate kinase, EPSP synthase, and chorismate synthase. The pathway starts with two substrates, phosphoenol pyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate and ends with chorismate, a substrate for the three aromatic amino acids. The fifth enzyme involved is the shikimate kinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of shikimate to form shikimate 3-phosphate (shown in the figure below). Shikimate 3-phosphate is then coupled with phosphoenol pyruvate to give 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate via the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase. :450px Then 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate is transformed into chorismate by a chorismate synthase. :450px Prephenic acid is then synthesized by a Claisen rearrangement of chorismate by chorismate mutase. :350px Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and Œ±-ketoglutarate. :450px = Starting point in the biosynthesis of some phenolics = Phenylalanine and tyrosine are the precursors used in the phenylpropanoids biosynthesis. The phenylpropanoids are then used to produce the flavonoids, coumarins, tannins and lignin. The first enzyme involved is phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) that converts L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia.  Gallic acid biosynthesis  Gallic acid is formed from 3-dehydroshikimate by the action of the enzyme shikimate dehydrogenase to produce 3,5-didehydroshikimate. This latter compound spontaneously rearranges to gallic acid. = Other compounds = Shikimic acid is a precursor for: * indole, indole derivatives and aromatic amino acid tryptophan and tryptophan derivatives such as the psychedelic compound dimethyltryptamine * many alkaloids and other aromatic metabolites  Mycosporine-like amino acids  Mycosporine-like amino acids are small secondary metabolites produced by organisms that live in environments with high volumes of sunlight, usually marine environments.  Uses  In the pharmaceutical industry, shikimic acid from the Chinese star anise (Illicium verum) is used as a base material for production of oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Although shikimic acid is present in most autotrophic organisms, it is a biosynthetic intermediate and in general found in very low concentrations. The low isolation yield of shikimic acid from the Chinese star anise is blamed for the 2005 shortage of oseltamivir. Shikimic acid can also be extracted from the seeds of the sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) fruit, which is abundant in North America, in yields of around 1.5%. For example, 4 kg of sweetgum seeds is needed for fourteen packages of Tamiflu. By comparison, star anise has been reported to yield 3% to 7% shikimic acid. Biosynthetic pathways in E. coli have recently been enhanced to allow the organism to accumulate enough material to be used commercially. A 2010 study released by the University of Maine showed that shikimic acid can also be readily harvested from the needles of several species of pine tree. Protecting groups are more commonly used in small-scale laboratory work and initial development than in industrial production processes because their use adds additional steps and material costs to the process. However, the availability of a cheap chiral building block can overcome these additional costs, for example, shikimic acid for oseltamivir. Aminoshikimic acid is also an alternative to shikimic acid as a starting material for the synthesis of oseltamivir.  Target for drugs  Shikimate can be used to synthesise (6S)-6-fluoroshikimic acid, an antibiotic which inhibits the aromatic biosynthetic pathway. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, kills plants by interfering with the shikimate pathway in plants. More specifically, glyphosate inhibits the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). \\"Roundup Ready\\" genetically modified crops overcome that inhibition.

Garside and Gray, who had earned a reputation for their abrasive songwriting with Daisy Chainsaw, incorporated elements of blues rock and other genres with Queenadreena, in addition to their predominant noise rock influences. The band released four studio albums between 2000 and 2008, beginning with the critically acclaimed Taxidermy (2000). The band signed with Rough Trade Records for their second release, Drink Me (2002), before being dropped by the label, after which they signed with the independent label One Little Indian. The band also released a live album, Live at the ICA, which was recorded at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In 2010, the group disbanded and Garside pursued other solo projects, namely Ruby Throat. History =Formation, Taxidermy: 1999‚Äì2001= Queenadreena formed in 1999 after guitarist Crispin Gray came in contact with KatieJane Garside, with whom he had collaborated with in 1989 when they formed the band Daisy Chainsaw. Garside left Daisy Chainsaw after completing two years with the band, and went into seclusion in the Lake District, where she lived in the historic Rigg Beck, a retreat for artists and bohemians. Returning to London in 1998, Garside moved to Belsize Park, where Gray had also been living, and the two reconnected to form the group. They were joined by drummer Billy Freedom and bassist Orson Wajih and released their first album, Taxidermy, in early 2000, on the Blanco y Negro Records imprint. Some of the material featured on the album, namely the track \\"X-ing Off the Days,\\" was written solely by Gray in the years following the breakup of Daisy Chainsaw. NME gave the album a positive review, writing: \\"While carrying on Daisy Chainsaw's predilection for rock as infantile nightmare, here the scope is much wider than a one-track take on banshee pop. There are some obvious precedents, notably Bj√∂rk and PJ Harvey, but much more than either of those two reference points, this debut album is frequently akin to eavesdropping on psychotherapy.\\" To support the record, the band toured nationally supporting Nine Inch Nails, as well as performances at the 2000 Reading and Leeds Festivals. After its release, the band's name was changed slightly, from \\"Queen Adreena\\" to \\"QueenAdreena\\", and subsequent releases reflect this. During this time, the band released a split single, featuring a cover of Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene,\\" and \\"Pretty Polly.\\" =Label shifts: 2002‚Äì06= Garside performing with Queenadreena, Dublin, 2006 Billy Freedom was replaced in 2002 by drummer Pete Howard, formerly of The Clash. The band signed with Rough Trade for their second album, 2002's Drink Me. The record spawned the single \\"Pretty Like Drugs,\\" which garnered the band attention from rock press. The album was well received by such publications as Drowned in Sound, who gave it a 7/10 rating, writing: \\"KatieJane Garside is the kind of woman who makes ordinarily rational grown guys go weak at the knees. \\"Pretty Like Drugs\\" will show you why. As her cutesy lost girl Tori Amos/Bj√∂rk-isms erupt into fearsome hollers that would have piss dribbling down Courtney Love‚Äôs surgically enhanced thighs, it‚Äôll all make sense.\\" The French publication Les inrockuptibles described the record as \\"Gothic, dark, and threatening.\\" Rough Trade dropped the group shortly after the release of Drink Me, and Wajih left the band while they embarked on a tour supporting Garbage. Janie Jarvis, formerly of Radiator, joined the band as a temporary bassist for their tour, before former Daisy Chainsaw bassist Richard Adams joined the group. Adams shortly after left the band, and they appeared at the Castle Donington Download Festival in 2003. The band signed with One Little Indian Records in 2004, and released The Butcher and the Butterfly with KatieJane's sister Melanie Garside on bass, who left soon after and was replaced by Paul Jackson (not to be confused with the fusion bassist of the same name). On March 22, 2005, the band recorded a live album at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. The album was released in September as Live at the ICA. =Djin and dissolution: 2007‚Äì10= In 2007, Queenadreena independently released Ride a Cock Horse, an album composed of early demos. Further line-up changes saw Nomi Leonard becoming the new bass player and, in the latter half of 2008, Pete Howard being replaced on drums by Stephen Gilchrist. On October 8, 2008, Queenadreena released their fourth studio album, Djin, initially only in Japan through Imperial Records. The album eventually saw a release in the United Kingdom September 2009, but was not actively promoted by the band which, by then, was effectively on hiatus. Incorporating influences of blues rock more heavily than the band's early releases did, Allmusic called the record \\"[Queenadreena's] masterpiece, balancing all their characteristically mercurial elements on the solid basis of the mastery of an accomplished band, which was left by the media to grow at its own pace.\\" In 2011, Crispin Gray stated, \\"I wouldn't rule out some kind of reunion gigs in the future. I don't think there will be another record from Queenadreena though, I would be very surprised myself. I haven't heard from Katie in well over a year and I don‚Äôt know where she is.\\" In a 2020 interview on Conan Neutron‚Äôs Protonic Reversal Garside, who released an album under the name Liar, Flower, expressed extreme skepticism about working with Gray in the future or further Queenadreena material including her contributions.

The most important system this year was Hurricane Ava, which was the most intense Pacific hurricane known at the time. Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to, or made landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico. The most serious of these was Hurricane Irah, which downed power and communication lines in parts of the Baja California Peninsula; the other landfalling storms caused rain and some flooding. No tropical cyclone this season caused any deaths. This season had a quick start but a slow end. Overall activity was below average, with twelve named systems in total. Of these, five were tropical storms, seven were hurricanes, of which three were major (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Just one storm formed in August, one of the least active Augusts ever in the east Pacific. The season officially started May 15, 1973, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1973, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1973. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean, often off the coast of Mexico. As is usual in the northern hemisphere, most traveled generally westward or northwestward, and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:60 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1973 till:01/11/1973 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1973 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0-62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(119-153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:02/06/1973 till:12/06/1973 color:C5 text:\\"Ava (C5) from:22/06/1973 till:23/06/1973 color:TS text:\\"Bernice (TS)\\" from:26/06/1973 till:29/06/1973 color:TS text:\\"Claudia (TS)\\" from:18/07/1973 till:03/08/1973 color:C4 text:\\"Doreen (C4)\\" from:21/07/1973 till:28/07/1973 color:C4 text:\\"Emily (C4)\\" from:25/07/1973 till:30/07/1973 color:C1 text:\\"Florence (C1)\\" from:30/07/1973 till:05/08/1973 color:TS text:\\"Glenda (TS)\\" barset:break from:31/08/1973 till:01/09/1973 color:TS text:\\"Heather (TS)\\" from:22/09/1973 till:26/09/1973 color:C2 text:\\"Irah (C2)\\" from:23/09/1973 till:27/09/1973 color:TS text:\\"Jennifer (TS)\\" from:29/09/1973 till:09/10/1973 color:C2 text:\\"Katherine (C2)\\" from:05/10/1973 till:09/10/1973 color:C1 text:\\"Lillian (C1)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1973 till:01/07/1973 text:June from:01/07/1973 till:01/08/1973 text:July from:01/08/1973 till:01/09/1973 text:August from:01/09/1973 till:01/10/1973 text:September from:01/10/1973 till:01/11/1973 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" The season began with the formation of the pre-Ava tropical depression on June 2 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Lillian on October 9. The season lasted a total of 129 days. No named storms formed in May, three in June, four in July, one in August, three in September, one in October, and none in November. Another six tropical depressions formed during the year, but data on them is unavailable. All of these tropical cyclones formed in the eastern north Pacific tropical cyclone basin, which encompasses the Pacific Ocean north of the equator east of 140¬∞W. None formed in the central north Pacific, which is the remainder of the Pacific Ocean east of the international dateline. Of the tropical cyclones that formed this year, were twelve tropical storms and seven were hurricanes. Of those hurricanes, three of them were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir- Simpson Scale. These totals are all below the long-term averages of thirteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. At the time, this season's total of twelve named tropical cyclones was exactly average, although at the time the climatology in this basin was weak because satellite coverage was spotty before 1966. This season, all advisories and tropical cyclone data were released and collected by two agencies, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City, California, and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, Hawaii,. Retrieved 2009-05-20. both of which were coextensive with the National Weather Service Forecast Offices in their respective cities. The EPHC covered the area between the coast of North America and 140¬∞W, and the CPHC the remainder of the area. Systems =Hurricane Ava= A tropical depression formed on June 2. It steadily strengthened and headed in a generally westerly direction. It moved slowly and became Hurricane Ava on June 4. Two days later, it became a major hurricane and it sped up. On June 7, it became a Category 5 hurricane. It then started weakening and slowed down until it dissipated on June 12. No deaths or damages were attributed to Hurricane Ava. Ava's minimum central pressure was 915 millibars, and its maximum sustained winds reached . This made Ava the most intense recorded east Pacific hurricane at the time. Ava reached Category 5 intensity on June 7, the earliest date in an east Pacific season that a hurricane has done so. It was also the second known Category 5 storm in the east Pacific; (behind Patsy in 1959). Ava is the strongest June storm, the fifth most intense east Pacific hurricane, and was the only June Category 5 on record until 2010. Ava was also flown into by hurricane hunter aircraft in what was the first penetration of a Pacific hurricane by NOAA aircraft. During these flights, radars and other devices were tested, and wind speed, pressure, and wave heights were measured. This is the reason why Hurricane Ava's pressure is measured instead of estimated. Ava was also photographed from Skylab because it was visible during one of the missions. At that time, it was coincidentally on the surface of the Earth directly underneath the space station. All in all, these made Hurricane Ava one of the best-observed Pacific hurricanes at the time. =Tropical Storm Bernice= A nearly stationary disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone spent three days organizing and finally developed into a tropical depression on June 22. The cyclone started heading northwest. After intensifying into a tropical storm, Bernice made landfall on June 23 at a location roughly southwest of Zihuatanejo. It dissipated later that day. Bernice exposed two ships to gales, but otherwise neither deaths nor significant impact was reported. At its peak, Tropical Storm Bernice had winds of . =Tropical Storm Claudia= A tropical depression formed June 26 from a westward-moving area of disturbed weather. The next day, it developed gale- force winds and was named Claudia. Claudia headed northwesterly and then northwards and made landfall on June 28 approximately east of Acapulco. It dissipated inland the next day. No deaths or casualties were reported due to this tropical cyclone. =Hurricane Doreen= On July 18, a tropical storm formed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and was named Doreen. It steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on July 19. Doreen briefly reached Category 4 strength on July 21 with a relatively high central pressure of . It then weakened steadily as its path carried it on a direct path to the Big Island of Hawaii. Doreen weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on July 25. A frontal system stuck between two high-pressure areas weakened as the two areas merged, creating a larger high pressure area that turned Doreen to the southwest on July 27. The hurricane then turned back to the northwest and strengthened back into a hurricane. It became a major hurricane again before weakening. Doreen dissipated August 3. Its remnant vortex continued westward until it dissipated under a trough near the dateline. Doreen's sudden change of track and restrengthening was unusual. From formation to dissipation, Doreen lasted 16.25 days and traveled a distance of . This tied Hurricane Celeste's record for longest-lasting Pacific hurricane. Doreen was also the longest-lasting July tropical cyclone. Hurricane Fico broke both of these records in the 1978 season. Doreen remains the eighth-longest lasting Pacific tropical cyclone, tied with two other storms. Several ships encountered Doreen. The most serious incident involved a Greek ship called Cornelia which lost its rudder in waves, but managed to escape and continue on its way to Panama. On the afternoon of July 29, swells and waves were seen from Kapoho. Otherwise, no damages or deaths were blamed on this tropical cyclone. =Hurricane Emily= A depression formed July 21 from squalls in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and headed west-northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm. Emily continued moving nearly parallel to the coast before turning to the west while steadily intensifying. Emily eventually reached Category 4 intensity on July 22. Emily then weakened as it turned to the northwest. It dissipated on July 28. Emily's wind field was large enough to bring gales areas east of the hurricane from July 22 to 24. This tropical cyclone caused no deaths or damage. Emily had a pressure of 972 mbar, which is unusually high for a hurricane of Category 4 strength. =Hurricane Florence= On July 25, a depression formed off the coast of Guatemala. The storm made a close approach to the Mexican coast as a depression, but did not make landfall. Just after that, it strengthened into a tropical storm. Florence headed west and then west-northwest. It became a hurricane on July 29. It began weakening thereafter. Florence dissipated on July 30. No damages or deaths were reported. =Tropical Storm Glenda= A depression that had formed on July 30 from a tropical disturbance quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Glenda. It took a path similar to both Florence and Emily, but further from the shore. Glenda dissipated August 5. At the time it still had winds of , down from its peak of . No deaths, damage, or other impact was reported. =Tropical Storm Heather= The only storm to form in August this year formed on August 31 from an area of circulation in the ITCZ over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It became a tropical depression on August 30. After moving northwest for a bit, it became a tropical storm and headed almost due north towards Mexico. Heather dissipated September 1, just before making landfall. Tropical Storm Heather caused no deaths or damage to any location in the coastal area of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. =Hurricane Irah= A depression formed September 22. It became a tropical storm on September 23 and a hurricane on September 24. Irah took a northwesterly path and reached Category 2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and then dropped back down to a 1 as it recurved. It made landfall on Baja California and entered the Gulf of California as a tropical storm, making landfall again in northwestern Mexico approximately northwest of Los Mochis. Irah's first landfall was the strongest of the season. The hurricane dissipated on September 27 while heading east-northeast over mainland Mexico. Irah blew over some power and communication lines during its passage over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Heavy rain fell over parts of Mexico, with the highest total being at Sierra de la Laguna. One person was injured and at least ten houses were destroyed in Cabo San Lucas. No one was killed. There was some concern that the hurricane could disrupt splashdown procedures for astronauts at the end of Skylab 3; however, the return to Earth was not seriously affected. =Tropical Storm Jennifer= On September 23, another depression formed. It took a northeasterly path, rotating around the southern periphery of Hurricane Irah as part of a Fujiwara interaction. It strengthened into a tropical storm late on September 24. The peak windspeed of this tropical cyclone was . Jennifer then weakened to a depression and turned to the north- northeast. Jennifer brushed the Islas Mar√≠as. The cyclone made landfall near just southeast of Mazatl√°n and dissipated September 27. Tropical Depression Jennifer caused rain over several parts of Mexico. The highest total was at Navarette/San Blas. No one was killed and no damage was reported. =Hurricane Katherine= Katherine became a tropical storm on September 29, just six hours after forming. It headed out to sea. On October 1, it became a hurricane category 5 . It peaked in windspeed the next day. After weakening to storm strength, it crossed 140¬∞W and entered the central Pacific. Katherine continued its slightly south of westward track. It dropped to a depression on October 9, and dissipated shortly after that due to the influence of a cold trough =Hurricane Lillian= A depression that formed October 5 reached storm strength the same day. It generally paralleled the coast of Mexico far offshore. Lillian reached minimal hurricane strength on October 7 and peaked the next day. The hurricane began to weaken immediately thereafter and dissipated on October 9. Through its life, Lillian at first traveled generally west-northwestward, and then westward. Lillian never threatened land, causing no known impact. Storm names These names were used for storms that formed in the eastern Pacific during this season. It is the same list used in the 1969 season. Storms were named Katherine and Lillian for the first time this year. No names were retired, so this list was used again in the 1977 season. Names that weren't assigned are colored gray. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  * Ava * Berenice * Claudia * Doreen * Emily * Florence * Glenda  * Heather * Irah * Jennifer * Katherine * Lillian * *    * } The Central Pacific used names and numbers from the Western Pacific's typhoon list. No systems formed in the area, and thus no names were required. Season effects This is a table of all of the storms in the 1973 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their durations, peak intensities, names, landfall(s), damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or a low.

He was a French statesman, son of Louis Charles Machault d'Arnouville, lieutenant of police. In 1721, he was counsel to the Parlement of Paris, in 1728 he was ma√Ætre des requ√™tes, and ten years later was made president of the Great Council; although he had opposed the court in the Unigenitus dispute, he was appointed intendant of Hainaut in 1743. From this position, through the influence at court of his old friend the marquis d'Argenson, he was called to succeed Philibert Orry as controller-general of the finances in December 1745. On taking office, he found that in the four years of the War of the Austrian Succession the economies of Cardinal Fleury had been exhausted, and he was forced to develop the system of borrowing which was bringing French finances to the verge of bankruptcy. In 1749, he attempted a reform in the levying of direct taxes, which, if carried out, would have done much to prevent the later Revolutionary movement. He proposed to abolish the old tax of a tenth or tithe (in French d√Æme), which was evaded by the clergy and most of the nobility, and substituted a tax of one-twentieth (in French \\"vingti√®me\\") that would have been levied on all. The inclusion of the church made this bill popular with the larger public, in addition to the philosophes, the Jansenists, and the Gallicans. However, there were loud remonstrances from bishops (particularly Christophe de Beaumont, the Archbishop of Paris) and the devout party at Louis XV's court. The clergy stood by their historical privileges, and the outcry of the nobility was virulent, and the proposal was rejected. Despite this, Machault managed to retain his office until July 1754, when he exchanged the controllership for the Naval Ministry. Foreseeing the disastrous results of the alliance with Austria, he was drawn to oppose more decidedly the schemes of Madame de Pompadour, whose personal ill-will he had gained. On 1 February 1757 Louis XV acquiesced in her demand for his removal. Machault retired to his estate at Arnouville until the Revolution broke out in 1789, when, after a period of hiding, he was apprehended in 1794 at Rouen and brought to Paris as a suspect. He was imprisoned in the Prison des Madelonnettes, where he died after a few weeks at the age of ninety-three. Family His eldest son, Louis Charles de Machault d'Arnouville (1737‚Äì1820), was bishop of Amiens from 1774 until the Revolution. He was one of the most uncompromising conservatives at the Estates-General of 1789, where he voted consistently against every reform. He emigrated in 1791, which provoked the arrest of the members of his family still in France in 1793, when his father and his brothers Charles and Armand were arrested as parents and relatives of an √©migr√©. Upon his return to France in 1802, he resigned his bishopric in order not to be an obstacle to Concordat of 1801, and he retired to the ancestral ch√¢teau of Arnouville, where he died in 1820.

The Barrens operates in a similar manner to Adirondack Park, with public lands managed by a mix of federal, state, county and local public land managers intermixed with private inholdings. It is Long Island's largest natural area and its last remaining wilderness. The region contains a remnant of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion, whose forests might once have covered a quarter million acres (1,000 km¬≤) on Long Island. The Central Pine Barrens overlays and recharges a portion of a federally designated sole source aquifer for Long Island's drinking water. All of Long Island's drinking water comes from ground water wells; none of the island's water comes from reservoirs. Almost all of the Peconic River and Carmans River (two of Long Island's four biggest rivers) as well as much of their watersheds are in the Barrens. History In the 1970s the State of New York began acquiring large parcels to create a greenbelt. The federal government at Brookhaven National Laboratory transferred in 1971 and RCA transferred around Rocky Point in 1978 (for a cost of $1). In 1984 the Pine Barrens Review Commission was created to review development in the region. In 1986 the Suffolk County Open Space Program financed by a 0.25% sales tax was to result in 28 new Suffolk County Parks in the region totalling Despite the efforts development pressure continued and in 1989 the Long Island Pine Barrens Society filed a multibillion-dollar suit against Suffolk County, and the towns of Brookhaven, Riverhead and Southampton. The Society eventually lost its suit in the New York's highest court‚Äîthe New York Court of Appeals‚Äîafter winning in earlier courts. In 1993 the New York State Legislature approved the Long Island Pine Barrens Protection Act to protect the region through the development and implementation of a comprehensive land use plan. The act also created the Central Pine Barrens Joint Planning & Policy Commission to oversee the plan, and divided the area into two regions: *A core area where no development is permitted at all. The area was expanded to in 1998 with the addition of Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge. Seventy- five percent of the land in the core area is to be acquired. A provision of the law allows private ownership in the core area provided there is a transfer of development rights arrangement where the owner can build elsewhere by transferring ownership of the core lands to a government entity. *A Compatible Growth Area of where limited, environmentally compatible development is allowed. The initial towns were Brookhaven, Riverhead, and Southampton. In 1998 East Hampton set aside a small portion of land for the Barrens and it was expanded to in 2007.County Executive Steve Levy, Supervisor Bill McGintee and Members of The Ross School Hail Preservation of 71 Acres - co.suffolk.ny.us Wildfires =Sunrise Wildfire of 1995= DEC sign commemorating the fire In late August-early September 1995, a series of major brush fires swept through the pine barrens region. The first major fire incident occurred in Rocky Point, but was extinguished within days of its outbreak. A larger, more catastrophic fire erupted in the Westhampton area just shortly after the Rocky Point blaze was brought to an end. The fire, aided by high winds and dry conditions, quickly spread, threatening area homes and businesses. The fire was nicknamed the \\"Sunrise Wildfire\\", as it engulfed both sides of Sunrise Highway, the major highway connecting the Hamptons region with the rest of Long Island. The fires closed down the highway and stopped railroad service, effectively cutting the Hamptons off from the rest of the island for days as firefighters from all over Long Island, the FDNY and Connecticut worked around the clock to battle the blaze. By early September, the Sunrise Wildfire was extinguished, but the results of that fire, in addition to the Rocky Point fire, were disastrous: Approximately had burned, numerous homes and small businesses suffered damage, and 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes. The fire, which erupted during the peak of the Hamptons' tourist season, resulted in a considerable economic blow for the region. However, the human toll was very light, a few firefighters suffered injuries, and nobody was killed in the event. As of 2007, the region has mostly recovered from the damage it sustained, although some vegetation still bears the scars of the fire. Pine Barren ecosystems are highly adapted to fire and generally require periodic fires to maintain their unique vegetation and wildlife. =Brookhaven Blaze of 2012= On April 9, 2012, several brushfires joined together to ignite over of woodland around Manorville, Ridge and Brookhaven. By the end of the day, the fires were intense enough to cause a closure of parts of the Long Island Expressway. Parts of Riverhead were placed under mandatory evacuation. Brush fire burned of pine lands. About 600 firefighters from about 109 departments battled the fire with 30 brush trucks, 20 tankers, and 100 engines. Airdrops of water were made by a New York State Police helicopter.

Such a rocket stage contains two large, airtight propellant tanks; it was realized that the larger tank could be retrofit into the living quarters of a space station, while the smaller one could be used for the storage of waste. A large rocket stage would reach a low Earth orbit and undergo later modification. This would make for a cost- effective reuse of hardware that would otherwise have no further purpose, but the in-orbit modification of the rocket stage could prove difficult and expensive. , no wet-workshop space station has been built or flown. A wet workshop is contrasted with a \\"dry workshop\\", where the empty upper stage is internally outfitted on the ground before launch with a human habitat and other equipment. It is not filled with propellant; instead the stage is launched into orbit by a sufficiently powerful rocket. The Apollo Applications Program of the 1960s studied using the Saturn V second stage S-II, and later planned to use the Saturn IB second stage S-IVB as a wet workshop, but cancellation of some Apollo program lunar landing missions made a two-stage Saturn V available to launch the station known as Skylab as an S-IVB dry workshop. Apollo-derived concepts Von Braun's sketch of a Space Station based on conversion of a Saturn V stage, 1964. Wernher von Braun proposed a wet workshop concept for launch on the Saturn V. His design modified the S-II second stage of the Saturn V stack to allow it to be used as living space once reaching orbit. Since the S-IC lower stage of the Saturn V cannot reach orbit on its own, the S-II would have to fire, and then vent out any remaining propellant once it reached orbit. To allow this, the floors of the station would be made of an open grid which allowed the propellant to pass through easily to the piping at the bottom of the tanks. The structure also presented convenient hand and footholds. Since the entire propellant load would be needed to reach orbit, additional life support equipment could not be stored inside the S-II during launch. von Braun's design placed all of this ancillary equipment in a large cylindrical carrier, which would be carried on top of the S-II stage in place of the S-IVB normally placed there. After reaching orbit and venting, a large access hatch in the top of the S-II's hydrogen tank would be opened. The cylindrical cargo module would then be inserted hydraulically into the tank through this opening, sealed, and then the tank would be repressurized to form a large living space. Power would be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S-II. During the 1960s, as the Apollo mission transitioned from development to launch, a number of groups inside NASA were studying the post-Apollo era. Many ideas for continuing use of the existing Saturn hardware were proposed, and some of these were collected under the name \\"Apollo X\\", which became the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). By the time AAP started to receive funding, the Saturn V lines were planned to shut down after producing just enough Saturn Vs for the Moon missions alone. However, during the same period of time, on-orbit testing of the Apollo systems was proceeding much better than expected, and a number of proposed shake-down missions were no longer required. This left a small number of Saturn IB launchers available for use. The Saturn IB stack consisted of two stages, the booster and an S-IVB stage on top, both of which needed to be fired in order to reach orbit. An S-IVB stage could be modified in a fashion similar to von Braun's original proposals, making a smaller but perfectly usable station. In this case, the equipment would be carried on top of the S-IVB in the location normally reserved for the Lunar Module, but the lack of a large access port meant it would have to remain there instead of being inserted into the tank. Considerable design work along these lines was carried out. When the later Apollo missions were canceled (18 through 20), a supply of Saturn Vs became available. By this time, so much work had been done on the S-IV-derived system that they decided to continue along those lines instead. The Saturn V delivered enough impulse in its first two stages to place the complete, ground-built station in orbit, and the design was flown as the Skylab \\"dry workshop\\". Another project involving the Apollo-derived wet workshop was the proposed Manned Venus Flyby. Shuttle-derived concepts Several similar conversions of the Space Shuttle's external tank (ET) were also studied. During launch the ET accelerated to about 98% of orbital speed before being dropped and deliberately spun in order to increase its drag. A number of proposals suggested keeping the ET attached to the Shuttle all the way into orbit, bleeding off any remaining propellant through the Space Shuttle Main Engines, which would have been \\"left open\\". One such test had been scheduled, but was canceled after the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster dramatically changed safety rules. The ET would have provided a huge working space, and one major problem with various wet workshop designs is what to do with all of it. The oxygen tank, the smaller of the two tanks inside the ET, was itself much larger than the entire Space Station Freedom. Additionally, getting access to the interior was possible though \\"manholes\\" used for inspection during construction, but it was not clear if realistic amounts of building materials could have been inserted into the tank after reaching orbit. Nevertheless, the problem was studied repeatedly. A similar concept, the \\"Aft Cargo Carrier\\", was studied by Martin Marietta in 1984. This consisted of a large cylindrical cargo container bolted onto the bottom of the ET, which offered the same volume as the Space Shuttle orbiter's cargo bay, but would be able to carry wider, bulkier loads. The same basic layout was also used as the basis for a short-duration station design. Although not a wet workshop in the conventional sense, the station piggybacks on the propellant tank and is therefore related to some degree. Space Launch System-derived concepts NASA contractor Brand Griffin has proposed to the Marshall Space Flight Center's Advanced Concepts Office the building of a station from a spent Space Launch System hydrogen fuel tank, to be placed at the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrangian point and named Skylab II in honor of the original Skylab.  Commercial space station application  NanoRacks, after finalizing its contract with NASA, and after winning NextSTEPs Phase II award, is now developing its concept Independence-1 (since renamed from Ixion), which would turn spent rocket tanks into a habitable living area.

W. Griffith. It is about the escapades of Lady Helen working as a domestic in a boarding house. In 2004, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for the National Film Registry.Lady Helen's Escapade at silentera.com  Plot  Lady Helen (Florence Lawrence) is a wealthy yet immensely bored woman who lives in a luxurious home with her three servants. In seek of adventure, she answers a help wanted in the newspaper and goes slumming as a domestic servant in a boarding house. She makes ludicrous efforts to cook, serve food, and clean, how ever the men living in the boarding house are enamored with her beauty and charm enough to overlook her incompetence. Among the boarders is a tall handsome violinist (David Miles), whose kindness and musical talent stand out among the crass manners of the other men. Helen and the violinist's romance inspires jealousy among the other maid, who conspire to get rid of Helen by framing her for the theft of the musician's violin. Although the violinist believes Helen is innocent, she is still fired and sent away. Helen soon reveals her true identity and reunites with the musician. After their reunion, Helen secures the violinist a position as a director at a conservatory.

Cumpson as Dinner Guest *Arthur V. Johnson as Dinner Guest *Vivian Prescott as Dinner Guest *Dorothy Bernard as Dinner Guest  Production  As was the case with most of the films Griffith made during this period, most of the film's props and costumes were recycled from other productions. Lawrence, the film's star, creatively utilized the recycled costumes to stand out and support her character, and some writers credit her work in Lady Helen's Escapade as the first to use of costume design. The film has a large cast that often appeared in the same scene‚Äîas many as nine performers appeared simultaneously in a single shot‚Äîso Griffith could not use close-ups to convey meaning and emotion. To compensate for this, the actors had to exaggerate their movements and gesticulations. As a result, much of the acting in the film resembles traditional stage performance rather than the more subtle performances associated with film.

The name of the game is a play on the title of the BBC television show One Man and His Dog. The object of the game is to use a doglike droid to collect Ramboids, the male form of alien sheep. The player must move these Ramboids into teleporters to win the game.  Gameplay  Before the game begins, the player is given the option of inputting a password in order to resume a game they were playing earlier, otherwise starting at the beginning. There are passwords for each of the twenty different ramboid-filled caverns, and as the player progresses through each cavern, the computer releases the corresponding password. At the start of a game, the screen is split up into several different windows. Largest and centrally placed is the main window that looks into a cavern, displaying a view of the droid placed centrally amongst the scenery. The first task is to guide the droid to the start position. Ramboids are dim. They move very predictably, and always reverse their direction of movement if their way is blocked. They are also delicate creatures that only live for about twenty minutes. The player is working against the clock all the time. Should the player fail to get at least four ramboids in the teleport in the right order within the time, play is returned to the first screen.  Music  The music of the C64 version was composed by Rob Hubbard. C64 enthusiasts and former owners frequently list Hubbard's composition as being one of the finest to feature in any game released for that machine. Hubbard himself states, that he took big inspriation of Jean-Michel Jarres album Magnetic Fields for this song. The Atari 8-bit and Amstrad versions had a different theme, which was shorter. Reception Zzap!64's reviewers thought that, although the game had basic graphics, it was enjoyable to play, with the bonus of a good soundtrack. It was given an overall rating of 81%.

According to Cheyne and Black, the name originally meant \\"·π¢ede·∏≥ is lord\\", but this would likely have been read later as meaning \\"lord of righteousness\\".W. Robertson Smith and George F. Moore (1899), \\"Adoni-zedec\\" in Cheyne and Black, eds. Encyclopaedia Biblica. Adonizedek led a coalition of five of the neighboring Amorite rulers (Hoham, king of Hebron; Piram, king of Jarmuth; Japhia, king of Lachish; and Debir, king of Eglon) in resisting the invasion, but the allies were defeated at Gibeon, and suffered at Beth-horon, not only from their pursuers, but also from a great hail storm. The five allied kings took refuge in a cave at Makkedah and were imprisoned there until after the battle, when Joshua commanded that they be brought before him; whereupon they were brought out, humiliated, and put to death. According to the Midrash, the name Adoni-zedek is translated as \\"Master of Zedek\\"‚Äîthat is, \\"of Jerusalem\\", the city of righteousness.Genesis Rabbah xliii. 6. For an English translation, see However, it appears that the Midrash has confused terms here. While the Hebrew word Zedek (tsedeq) can mean right/righteousness, it is not the meaning of Jerusalem. Adoni-zedek is Hebrew for Lord of Righteousness, or The Lord is Righteous, though the etymology of any name or title does not necessarily define the character of the person who bears it. The word Jerusalem (Yeru-shalayim in Hebrew) does not mean city of righteousness, but rather place/foundation of peace. Genesis 14:18-20 records that, some 600 years prior to Adoni-zedek, there was another ruler of Jerusalem named Melchi-zedek. \\"And Melchizedek King of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the Priest of the Most High God. And he blessed him (Abram), and said, 'Blessed Be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of Heaven and Earth; and blessed be the Most High God which has delivered your enemies into your hand.' And he gave him tithes of all.\\" It may be possible that Zedek is a dynastic name/title for the rulers of Jerusalem at that time; the Epistle to the Hebrews 5:6-7:22 by Apostle Paul, who himself claimed to be of the strictest Jewish Orthodox sect of the Pharisees, affirmed both the existence of Melchi-zedek and that Adoni-zedek could not be his biological descendant: \\"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way - for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. And no man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also Messiah glorified not Himself to be made an high priest, but (He was made High Priest by) He that said unto Him, 'Thou Art My Son, today have I begotten Thee!' As He saith, also, in another place, \\"Thou art a Priest FOREVER after the Order of Melchizedek,\\" who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death and was heard in that He feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered; and, being made perfect, He became the Author of Eternal Salvation unto all them that obey Him Called of God and High Priest After the Order of Melchizedek.\\" \\"For when God made promise to Abraham, because God could swear by no greater, He swear by Himself, saying, 'Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.' And so, after he (Abraham) had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show onto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us - which Hope we have as an Anchor of the Soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the Veil, into which the Forerunner is entered for us, that is, Yehoshuah (Jesus), made an High Priest Forever After the Order of Melchizedek.\\" \\"For this Melchizedek King of Salem Priest of the Most High God - who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all - first being, by interpretation, 'King of Righteousness', and after that, also, 'King of Salem' which is 'King of Peace', without father, without mother, without dissent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, abided the priest continually. Now, consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who received the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their Brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham. But he (Melchizedek) whose descent is not counted from them (the Levites) received tides of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises. And without all contradiction the lesser is blessed of the better. And here men that died receive tithes, but there (back then) he received them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes (to Melchizedek through) Abraham - for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him! If, therefore, perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people receive the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the Order of Melchizedek and not be called after the Order of Aaron? For, the priesthood being changed, there is made, of necessity, a change also of the law! For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar - for it is evident that our Lord (Jesus) sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. And it is yet far more evident, for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandant, but after the power of an endless life - for He testifieth: Thou art a Priest FOREVER After the order of Melchizedek! For there is verily a disannulling of the Commandment going before, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better Hope did, by the which we draw nigh unto God. And in as much as not without an oath he was made priest (for those priests were made without an oath), but this (instance) with an oath by Him that said unto Him, 'The Lord swear and will not repent, Thou art a Priest Forever After the Order of Melchizedek.' By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better Testament!\\" Identification with Abdi-Heba M. G.

Dr Linda Sissons is the current Acting Chief Executive. History UCOL was founded in 1907 and was known as the Palmerston North Technical School. In 1971 it became the Palmerston North Technical Institute and in 1983 the Manawatu Polytechnic. At the time it specialised in trade apprenticeship courses, and in hobby, art, and craft classes, along with a range of night school programmes in business studies for working adults. As successive governments placed emphasis on vocational education, the Polytechnic broadened the courses offered, but retained a focus on core vocational programmes. It now delivers Foundation and Certificate programmes, Diplomas, Degrees and Post-Graduate options in a range of subjects as well as community based programmes. In 1987 the Manawatu Polytechnic opened a small campus in Levin and the 1996 approval by government of a $22 million capital injection, enabled the rebuilding and consolidation of the Palmerston North campus onto a central city site. In late 1998 the Manawatu Polytechnic changed its name to the Universal College of Learning (UCOL). UCOL expanded in January 2001 with the incorporation of the Masterton Regional Polytechnic and the integration of the Wanganui Regional Community Polytechnic on 1 April 2002. On 1 April 2020, UCOL was subsumed into New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology alongside the 15 other Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs).

A related concept, Nusach (), refers to the traditional order and form of the prayers. Etymology The Hebrew root N-H-G () means primarily \\"to drive\\" or, by extension, \\"to conduct (oneself)\\". The actual word minhag appears twice in the Hebrew Bible, both times in the same verse, and translated as \\"driving\\": Homiletically, one could argue that the use of the word minhag in Jewish law reflects its Biblical Hebrew origins as \\"the (manner of) driving (a chariot)\\". Whereas Halakha (law), from the word for walking- path, means the path or road set for the journey, minhag (custom), from the word for driving, means the manner people have developed themselves to travel down that path more quickly. The present use of minhag for custom may have been influenced by the Arabic minhaj, though in current Islamic usage this term is used for the intellectual methodology of a scholar or school of thought (cf. Hebrew derech) rather than for the customs of a local or ethnic community. Minhag and Jewish law In addition to the 613 commandments, observant Jews consider halakha, Jewish law as derived from the Talmud, binding upon all Jews. In addition to these, there have always been customs. Some customs were universally adopted (e.g. wearing a head covering), or almost universally (e.g. monogamy). Others are observed by major segments of Jewry but not by others (e.g. not eating kitniyot on Passover). Other customs are bound to certain localities or groups that originated in certain localities. These minhagim exist in various forms: * Ancient minhagim go back to the time of the Talmud and earlier. Today they are generally regarded as universally binding. The oldest recorded minhag is that of 'beating the Aravot' (Willow Branches) on Hoshanah Rabbah, and dates back to the era of the Prophets. * Later minhagim are followed by specific groups. ** Jews whose ancestors continued to live in the Middle East and Africa until the establishment of the State of Israel, regardless of where they live now, tend to follow a variety of customs, such as Mizrahi-Sephardi or Temani. Jews whose ancestors lived in Central Europe in the Middle Ages (regardless of where they live now) tend to follow Ashkenazic customs, while those whose families originated in the Iberian peninsula generally follow Sephardic customs. (The Talmud gives detailed rules for people who visit or move to a locale where the custom differs from their own.) Hasidim tend to follow their own minhagim. ** Within these broad categories there are also sub-groups by origin (e.g. Lithuanian or Polish or German customs), by location (e.g. \\"minhag Yerushalayim\\") or by branch (e.g. Skverrer Hasidim follow different customs than Chabad Hasidim). ** Families and even individuals may adhere to specific minhagim not followed by others. =Discussion in rabbinic literature= Various sources in rabbinic literature stress the importance of a long-held tradition, culminating in the statement \\"the minhag of our fathers is [equivalent to] Torah\\".e.g. Tosafot to Menahot 20b s.v. nifsal Custom can thus determine halachic practice in cases of disagreement among rabbinic authorities. In numerous instances, Rabbi Moses Isserles warns that one should not abolish long-held customs. (Isserles' gloss on the Shulchan Aruch was, in fact, written so as to delineate Ashkenazi minhagim alongside Sephardi practices in the same code of law.) Despite the above, a minhag does not override clear biblical or talmudic enactments, and one may not transgress the latter for the sake of the former. In fact, any minhag that intrinsically involves an element of halakha violation is considered null and void.See Piskei Riaz, Pesachim 4:1:7 The Talmud rules that a valid minhag accepted by previous generations of a family or community is binding upon all later generations.Pesachim 50 The Rosh states that the Talmud's ruling fundamentally applies to practices undertaken by learned individuals; innovations by the unlearned need only be followed publicly.Makom Shenahagu, 3 Other halakhic authorities hold that the Talmud's ruling applies to all valid practices initiated by either learned or unlearned individuals.For discussion of this point see Bach and Beit Yosef to Yoreh Deah 214; Shach, ibid., 214:7 In most cases, personal acceptance of a new minhag is tantamount to vowing performance of that minhag. Consequently, abandonment of such a minhag typically requires hatarat nedarim or sh'eilat chakham, halakhic procedures for absolving oneself from oaths. This was often necessary when, for example, an Ashkenazi Jew moved to the Ottoman Empire and wished to join the local Sephardi community. =Changing minhagim= Jewish law provides for a number of mechanisms to change or remove a custom when it is held to be mistaken or illogical.See Tosafot on Talmud Pesachim 51a; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Issurei Biah; Be'er Heitev, Orach Chaim 182, Orach Chaim 653, Orach Chaim 551:4 Orthodox rabbi and historian of Jewish law Menachem Elon writes: :Custom, because of its spontaneous and undirected nature, sometimes calls for a measure of supervision and control. At times a custom may be founded on error, or develop unreasonably or illogically in a certain direction, or may even be in conflict with substantive and fundamental principles of Jewish law in a manner leaving no room for its integration into the system. From time to time the halakhic scholars exercised such control in order to contain or discredit entirely a particular custom.The Principles of Jewish Law, single volume English edition =Present day= The acute displacement brought about by World War II and the Holocaust, and the large-scale immigration to the United States, various European countries, and especially the State of Israel, have led to a \\"liberal mixing\\" of various minhagim, and arguably the falling into disuse of certain customs. In addition, the baal teshuva movement has created a large group who have no clear tradition from their parents. In response to these phenomena, certain scholars have focused on the minhagim, and attempts have been made to revive minhagim that have fallen into disuse. Nusach Nusach (properly n√≥sach) primarily means \\"text\\" or \\"version\\", the correct wording of a religious text. Thus, the nusach tefillah is the text of the prayers, either generally or as used by a particular community. In common use nusach has come to signify the entire liturgical tradition of the community, including the musical rendition. It is narrower than minhag, which can refer to custom in any field, not necessarily that of communal prayer. Both nusach and minhag can thus be used for liturgic rite or liturgic tradition though sometimes a nusach appears to be a subdivision of a minhag or vice versa; see different Jewish rites and popular siddurim under Siddur. In general one must pray according to one's \\"nusach of origin\\" unless one has formally joined a different community and accepted its minhag. (Perisha rules that if one abandons a nusach that has been accepted universally by the wider Jewish community, his prayer is disqualified and must be repeated using the accepted nusach: Arba'ah Turim, Orach Chayim, 120 ad loc). The main segments of traditional Judaism, as differentiated by nusach (broadly and narrowly), are these: * Nusach Ashkenaz: the general Ashkenazi rite of non-Chasidim. Can be subdivided into: ** Minhag Ashkenaz (German rite) ** Minhag Polin/Lita (Polish/Lithuanian/Prague rite) * Nusach Sefard or Nusach Ari (Ashkenazi Chasidic rite, heavily influenced by the teachings of Sephardi Kabbalists) * Minhag Sefaradi: in general refers to the various Sephardi liturgies, but also to obligation/permissibility of Kabbalistic elements within the rite. Versions of this are: ** The Spanish and Portuguese Jewish Rite ** Nusach Morocco (Moroccan rite: there are differences between the Spanish-Moroccan and the Arab-Moroccan customs) ** Nusach HaChida (The Chida's rite, named after Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai: often used by North African Jews) ** Nusach Livorno (Sephardic rite from nineteenth-century editions printed in Italy, often used by North African Jews) * Minhag Edot HaMizrach: often used to mean the Baghdadi rite, is more or less influenced by the Sephardi minhag * Nosach Teiman, can be subdivided into: ** Nosach Baladi, closely resembling the original Yemenite rite, but with later additions *** The form used by Dor Daim, who attempt to safeguard the oldest Baladi tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance, is the version originally used by all Yemenite Jews near the time of Maimonides. ** Nosach Shami, adopted from Sephardic siddurim. Rabbi Shalom ben Aharon HaKohen Iraqi would go to a different synagogue each Shabbath with printed Sephardic siddurim, requesting that they pray in the Sephardic rite and forcing it upon them if necessaryRabbi Yosef Qafih, Passover Aggadta (Hebrew), p. 11 * Nusach Eretz Yisrael; has not survived in any community, though an attempt to revive it has been made by Rabbi David Bar-Hayim of Machon Shilo; however it is thought to have had some influence on: ** Minhag Italiani and Minhag Ben√® Rom√¨, see Italian Jews ** Minhag Romania, the rite of the Romaniotes, that is, the original Greek Jewish community as distinct from the Sephardim References External links and resources ; References * Custom, jewishencyclopedia.com * A Historical Map of Jewish Liturgical Influence and Variation * The Rules of Halacha, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan * Minhag: A Custom with the Status of Law, jewfaq.org * Customs (Minhagim), nishmat.net ; Resources * Rabbinic literature ** Sages of Ashkenaz Database - Online collection of minhag seforim ** Minhagei Maharil, Rabbi Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin (Maharil), 1556. ** \\"Sefer HaMinhagim\\" (Hebrew Fulltext, PDF) Rabbi Isaac Tyrnau, 1566. ** \\"Ta'amei HaMinhagim\\", Rabbi A.

The clade originated on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia. Its last common ancestor is supposed to have diversified ca. 76 to 91 million years ago. Classification and phylogeny Laurasiatheria was discovered on the basis of the similar gene sequences shared by the mammals belonging to it; no anatomical features have yet been found that unite the group. The Laurasiatheria clade is based on DNA sequence analyses and retrotransposon presence/absence data. The name comes from the theory that these mammals evolved on the supercontinent of Laurasia, after it split from Gondwana when Pangaea broke up. It is a sister group to Euarchontoglires (or Supraprimates) with which it forms the clade Boreoeutheria. Laurasiatheria includes the following extant taxa: * Eulipotyphla, having subsumed: ** Erinaceomorpha: hedgehogs and gymnures (see Erinaceidae) ** the remaining families of Soricomorpha: moles, shrews, solenodons (cosmopolitan distribution) * Chiroptera: bats (cosmopolitan) * Perissodactyla: odd-toed ungulates including horses, tapirs and rhinoceroses * Artiodactyla: even-toed ungulates including camels, pigs, ruminants (giraffes, deer, antelopes, cattle, sheep, goats, etc.), hippopotamuses and cetaceans ** Cetacea: whales, dolphins, and porpoises * Ferae (unranked) containing the orders: ** Pholidota: pangolins ('scaly anteaters') (Africa, South Asia) ** Carnivora: cats, dogs, bears, seals, and others (cosmopolitan) Uncertainty still exists regarding the phylogenetic tree for extant laurasiatherians, primarily due to disagreement about the placement of Chiroptera and Perissodactyla. Based on morphological grounds, Chiroptera had long been classified in the superorder Archonta (e.g. along with treeshrews and the gliding colugos) until genetic research instead showed their kinship with the other laurasiatherians. The studies conflicted in terms of the exact placement of Chiroptera, however, with it being linked most closely to groups such as Eulipotyphla, Ferae or with Perissodactyla and Ferae in the Pegasoferae proposal. A 2011 study found that \\"trees reconstructed [...] for the 1,608-gene data set fully support [...] a basal position for Eulipotyphla and a more apical position for Chiroptera\\" (see cladogram below) and concluded that \\"Pegasoferae [...] does not appear to be a natural group.\\" A 2012 study supports the previous conclusions using a large genomic dataset, and places Eulipotyphla as a basal order and Chiroptera as sister to Cetartiodactyla, with maximal support for all nodes of their phylogenetic tree. The exact position of Perissodactyla remains less certain, with some studies linking it with Ferae into a proposed clade Zooamata while others unite it with Cetartiodactyla into Euungulata, a clade of 'true ungulates', yet some authors found better (but not full) support for the latter, while others found Perissodactyla to be sister to Carnivora. Two 2013 studies retrieve that chiropterans, carnivores, and euungulates form a clade, therefore involving that Eulipotyphla might be the sister group to all other Laurasiatheria taxa. Laurasiatheria is also posited to include several extinct orders and superorders. At least some of these are considered wastebasket taxa, historically lumping together several lineages based on superficial attributes and assumed relations to modern mammals. In some cases, these orders have turned out to either be paraphyletic assemblages, or to be composed of mammals now understood not to be laurasiatheres at all. * Meridiungulata (Collagen sequences found in Macrauchenia and Toxodon indicate what are now understood to be the sister taxon to perissodactyls) * Condylarthra (paraphyletic in relation to true ungulates, possibly polyphyletic since some forms may be afrotheres or even non-placental eutherians) * Dinocerata (natural clade closely related to perissodactyls and meridiungulates)Burger, Benjamin J., The systematic position of the saber- toothed and horned giants of the Eocene: the Uintatheres (order Dinocerata), Utah State University Uintah Basin Campus, Vernal, Utah, 2015 * Mesonychia (natural clade, though several members, such as Andrewsarchus, are now thought to belong in other groups) * Creodonta (potentially polyphyletic)  See also  * Gondwanatheria  References  = Further reading =    External links * Category:Mammal taxonomy Category:Mammal superorders ","title":"Laurasiatheria"},{"id":"2424347","text":"Jewish history of Pittsburgh, the second largest city in the state of Pennsylvania, United States, and the chief city of Western Pennsylvania. As of 2002, Jewish households represented 3.8% of Allegheny County households. In 2012, Pittsburgh's Jewish community celebrated its 100th year of federated giving through the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. The city's Jewish federation is one of the oldest in the country, marking the deep historical roots of Jews in Pittsburgh. Founding Former synagogue on Miller Street near downtown Pittsburgh, August 2007. There are no reliable records of the beginnings of the Pittsburgh Jewish community, but it has been ascertained that between 1838 and 1844 a small number of Jews, mostly from Baden, Bavaria, and W√ºrttemberg, settled in and around Pittsburgh. These communities continued to expand from 1847 until 1852. Though the first official Jewish service was held in the autumn of 1844, Jews in Pittsburgh did not officially organize until 1847, when several men worshiped in a room on Penn street and Walnut (now 13th) street, having engaged the Rev. Mannheimer as cantor. After this meeting, the men also formed a Bes Almon Society and purchased a cemetery at Troy Hill. This newly formed organization lacked homogeneity due to the varying religious views of its members, and divisions and reunions took place from time to time until about 1853, when a united congregation was formed under the name Rodef Shalom. In 1864 a small group of congregants dissatisfied with the movement toward Reform practices at Rodef Shalom formed a breakaway Orthodox congregation, Etz Chayyim (Tree of Life), and purchased a cemetery at Sharpsburg. By 1886, Etz Chayyim, now called Tree of Life Congregation, had affiliated itself with the Conservative movement. In the broader American Jewish community, Pittsburgh is also famous for the 1885 \\"Pittsburgh Platform\\" which articulated bold and radical new ideas from the Reform movement on approaching theology and the modern world. At the turn of the century, two or three synagogues were established in or on the fringe of the area which is now called the Lower Hill District. One old building near Elm Street (called \\"The Old Jewish Church\\" by some people) was demolished and replaced. A group called Beth Hamedrash Hagodol-Beth Jacob Congregation meets in the new synagogue. At least one old building has survived on nearby Miller Street in the area once known colloquially as \\"Jews Hill\\", although it has since been converted into a church. Philanthropic associations Pittsburgh is notable in American Jewish history on account of the conference (see Jew. Encyc. iv. 215, s.v. Conferences, Rabbinical) held there in 1885, and is also well known as a generous supporter of all national Jewish movements, notably the Hebrew Union College and the Denver Hospital. Among the more prominent local philanthropic and charitable institutions may be mentioned the following: *J. M. Gusky Orphanage and Home, with the Bertha Rauh Cohen Annex. The Home was founded in 1890 by Esther Gusky, in memory of her husband, Jacob Mark Gusky. The Annex was the gift in 1889 of Aaron Cohen in memory of his wife, Bertha Rauh Cohen, the only daughter of Rosalia Rauh and the late Solomon Rauh. The Home has 62 inmates, an annual income of about $10,000, and an endowment fund of $67,000. *The United Hebrew Relief Association, a union of the Hebrew Benevolent Society and the Hebrew Ladies' Aid Society. It dispenses $10,000 yearly, and has a sinking-fund of $29,000. *The Columbian Council School, a social settlement. It conducts a large number of classes, public lectures, a library, public baths, a gymnasium, etc. The bath-house was the gift of Alexander Peacock. The disbursements are about $6,000 annually. *The Ladies' Hospital Aid secures and pays for hospital attention for the sick poor. It has an annual income of about $8,000, and is at present endeavoring to erect a Jewish hospital. *The Young Ladies' Sewing Society, which dispenses clothing to the poor; income about $2,000 annually. The Concordia Club fosters Jewish social life in Pittsburgh. The Council of Jewish Women is represented by the Columbian Council. The Y.M.H.A. has been reorganized, and gives promise of great activity. The Independent Order of B'nai B'rith has five lodges; and the Independent Order of the Free Sons of Israel, the Sons of Benjamin, Sons of Israel, and Sons of Abraham have two each. There were two weekly papers, one in English. \\"The Jewish Criterion\\" published from 1895-1962, of which Rabbi Levy and Charles H. Joseph were the editors, and one in Yiddish, the \\"Volksfreund\\" published from 1922-1924. Prominent Jews Some Jewish people of Pittsburgh are prominent in the professions and in commerce. Donors to non- sectarian charities include J. D. Bernd and Isaac Kaufmann, the latter of whom in 1895 gave the Emma Kaufmann Free Clinic to the medical department of the University of Pittsburgh. Among those who have held positions in public life are Emanuel Wertheimer, select councilman and member of the state house of representatives; Morris Einstein, select councilman (15 years); Josiah Cohen, judge of the Orphans' Court; E. E. Mayer, city physician; L. S. Levin, assistant city attorney. Isaac W. Frank is president of the National Founders' Association, and A. Leo Weil is a member of the executive committee of the Voters' Civic League. Since 1882 there has been a steady increase in the number of Jewish people in Pittsburgh, the new settlers coming mostly from eastern Europe. Russian, Romanian, and Hungarian Jewish people came in large numbers, and began to display an appreciable interest in public affairs. They had six synagogues in 1906 (whose rabbis include Aaron M. Ashinsky and M. S. Sivitz), many ·∏•ebras, and a number of small religious societies. The Pittsburgh Jewry strongly sympathized with the Zionistic movement, having a large number of Zionistic societies. The number of Jewish inhabitants in 1906 is estimated at between 15,000 and 25,000, in a total population of about 322,000. Squirrel Hill Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood is considered to be the city's primary Jewish hub. Nearly half of the population of Squirrel Hill is Jewish. Squirrel Hill has had a large Jewish population since the 1920s, when Jewish people began to move to the neighborhood in large numbers from Oakland and Hill District neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. According to a 2002 study by the United Jewish Federation, 33% of the Pittsburgh Jewish population lived in Squirrel Hill and another 14% in the surrounding area. Squirrel Hill currently contains three Jewish day schools, catering to the Lubavich, Orthodox, and Conservative movements. There are over twenty synagogues. This Jewish community also offers four restaurants, a Jewish community center, and an annual festival.

The program was notable for its combination of a true WYSIWYG interface, powerful long-document processing features, and a well regarded outliner. It was also noted for its high resource demands, bugs, and its very late release. In spite of these problems, FullWrite developed a faithful following and some amount of commercial success. Douglas Adams used FullWrite as his primary word processor for some time. Douglas Hofstadter published several of his books directly from FullWrite, notably Le Ton beau de Marot. The product changed hands in the aftermath of Ashton-Tate's early 1990s business failure, and most of its problems were addressed in a major upgrade in 1995. By this point Microsoft Word dominated the Mac word processor market and the improved FullWrite never became particularly widely used. Since 1998, the product has been available as freeware. History =Genesis= FullWrite started life at a small company, Ann Arbor Softworks, publishers of the earlier FullPaint. Among a myriad of programs that were more or less direct clones of MacPaint, FullPaint was one of the first that really differentiated itself and was successful in the market. The company opened a sales office and changed their official address to Newbury Park, California, although most of the company, notably development, remained in Ann Arbor, MI. Looking for a new product while FullPaint was maturing, the team eventually decided on a word processor. At the time, the Mac word processor market was dominated by MacWrite, released free with the Macintosh when it first launched. MacWrite introduced a semi- WYSIWYG GUI to word processor users, and many of its conventions remain as standards today - selecting text with a drag of the mouse and then cutting it, for instance. Although MacWrite was a credible system for short documents, it lacked any of the features needed for long-document preparation, and had significant performance problems when creating documents more than a few pages long. The DOS word processor market was dominated by programs like WordStar and WordPerfect. These programs offered considerable power, including features for footnotes, table of contents and similar, but typically wrapped in a difficult to use and non-WYSIWYG editor. In spite of these problems, these applications were the only way to edit very large documents, and their difficult learning curve was addressed largely though consulting services - the term \\"word processor\\" was also a job description at that time. Another input into the eventual FullWrite product was the recent introduction of outliner products. These products were intended to help workers, and writers in particular, keep their work organized by introducing a top-down workflow. Instead of starting a document at the top and working their way to the bottom, outliners suggested the user first jot down their ideas in outline form, and then expand the outlines over time, in any order. If major changes had to be made, editing the outline itself could accomplish those changes in the document. There was serious consideration given to the idea that outliners might be ushering in a new way of writing. At the time, outliners were typically stand-alone products with limited integration with other applications, but there was clearly a desire for these systems to be integrated directly into the products they supported. =Design= FullWrite addressed each of these concepts and problems. To start with, FullWrite replaced MacWrite's GUI with one that was a true WYSIWYG display, optionally allowing the entire page to be displayed exactly as it would on the printer. Unlike other programs with similar features implemented as a \\"preview\\" mode, in FullWrite the document remained fully editable in this view. FullWrite also included a number of advanced layout features, such as user-adjustable kerning and automatic hyphenation. Text could be marked for inclusion in footnotes/endnotes, the table of contents or an index, all of which were automatically maintained. FullWrite also featured change bars, allowing users to track changes to the documents. Most of these features have since appeared on other high-end products, but at the time FullWrite was considerably more advanced than any competing products on the Mac, matching or beating the feature set of the high-end DOS products. One of the primary \\"selling features\\" of their new word processor was its well-integrated outliner. Unlike competing designs, FullWrite's solution supported not only one document outline, but any number of them, allowing the document to be arranged in several different ways. Additionally, the outlines were not separate from the document, but parts of it, and could be displayed or hidden as the user wished. In contrast, a more traditional outliner, like the one in Microsoft Word, uses portions of the document itself as the outliner's data, often header text. This forces the outline to have a 1-to-1 relationship between the document text and its logical organization. FullWrite's system was more flexible than competing solutions, and it continues to appear in discussions about outliners to this day. FullWrite also included the ability to attach notes to any object in the document, whether that be paragraphs, images or outliner items. Users could attach notes to the outline headers, to remind themselves what to put into that section when they came back to it later. The program also included a basic graphics editor, allowing users to add simple drawings to their documents without leaving the application. Its ability to wrap text around graphics was also notable; it did not simply move the text to the outline of the image container, it examined the image for the \\"drawn area\\" and could use that as the margin, tightly wrapping the image. The only notable outright missing feature was that the program did not include a built-in table editor. =Development= This powerful feature set came at a price: time-to- market. Development started in April 1986 and pre-release advertising was launched in December announcing that it would be released in January 1987 at a price around $300.Rory O'Connor, \\"Ann Arbor Softworks to Unveil Mac-Based Word Processor\\", InfoWorld, 24 November 1986, pg. 5 It was first shown to the public at MacWorld Expo in January 1987 with the promise that it would be released later that year. The date continued to be pushed further back. In March, Computer Reseller News reported it was being readied for April, but by August MacWEEK reported it to be \\"a month away\\" and a November issue claimed that the documentation was complete but the program was not. By this point the product had become something of a joke in the Mac world, winning numerous (unofficial) vaporware awards.\\"Vaporware: Study Guide\\", North Carolina State University Microsoft released Word 3.0 in 1987, and Ann Arbor responded by taking out a two-page advertisement headlined DON'T BUY IT, stating that FullWrite was \\"a superior word processor, at a better price ... at your store within 60 days\\".\\"Beware of Vaporware\\", Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, Volume 8 Number 1 (Fall 1994) This too turned out to be rather optimistic. Just prior to the January 1988 MacWorld Expo, where the company planned to ship the product, Ann Arbor was purchased by Ashton-Tate, with whom discussions had been underway for some time. The acquisition was kept a secret. At the Expo, instead of shipping, the company gave away 10,000 copies of the current beta version to drum up some buzz. This version contained an easter egg which would convert selected text into pig Latin if the user held down the right keys. The demo version of FullWrite completely filled a floppy disk, and FullWrite would crash if it did not have disk space available. Therefore, when potential customers launched the program directly off of the floppy (which was full), the program would crash. Ashton-Tate made tens of thousands of these demo disks, and was converting less than 0.1% of them to sales. =Shipping= FullWrite 2.0.6 with a sample document open. The images shows the full-page display that was a hallmark of the program. The document has two floating text blocks, one containing the automatically updated table of contents, the other simple \\"call out\\" text. After minor edits to change the copyright notices and packaging, the program finally shipped as version 1.1 on 27 April 1988,Ed Esber, \\"Ashton-Tate Ships FullWrite Professional, State-of- the-Art Macintosh Word Processing Software\\" , Ashton-Tate press release, 27 April 1988 at a suggested retail price of $395.Assadi 1989, pg. S1 Reviews of FullWrite were generally positive, and it reviewed well on feature comparisons.An InfoWorld review of high-end applications from August 1988 rated it higher than Microsoft Word and the Mac version of Word Perfect. See \\"Word Processors\\", InfoWorld, 8 August 1988, pp. S13-S26 They also generally noted a number of bugs and generally slow performance. One reviewer found that a fast typist could outtype the editor on even a reasonably fast machine like the SE/30. Many reviews also found the interface confusing and difficult to learn, a problem that was not helped by the fact that the \\"Learning\\" manual was just a rearranged version of the reference manual. A more serious problem was that the program needed 1 MB of RAM to work at all, and 2 MB and a hard drive to work comfortably.Harriett and Richard Johnson, \\"Mac's hot fudge sundae: FullWrite Professional\\", Computers in Libraries, February 1989 This was at a time when most new Macs shipped with 1 MB and used floppies for storage, and when users were starting to take advantage of the multitasking features offered by System 6's MultiFinder, using up a portion of that RAM. To make matters worse, Ashton-Tate downplayed the amount of memory required rather than admitting how much was really needed. This may have been the Achilles' heel of the product, seriously limiting its marketplace and resulting in frustrated users. Nevertheless, the product managed to gather a loyal, if small, following. For those users with machines capable of running it, it delivered on its promise of power with a Mac interface. It was perhaps the first program on the Mac that could be used to write large documents and books, something the excellent outliner helped with enormously. =Follow-up releases= The program managed to provide most word-processing features, but it was in need of additional cleanup and attention to performance and memory footprint. Ashton-Tate, however, never addressed these issues. Three minor versions were released in 1989 and 1990: 1.5, and 1.5s.\\"Ashton-Tate announces FullWrite Professional version 1.5 at MacWorld Exposition\\", PR Newswire, 7 August 1990 These fixed many bugs and some minor features, and 1.5s added a rarely used ability to add sound notes to documents (thus the \\"s\\" version). They also bundled an external product known as Tycho TableMaker to address that hole, but it was not well integrated, as one might expect from an external program. Microsoft Word released a major upgrade in 1988, 4.0, and Ashton-Tate never responded. After 1990 the product was at a standstill. During this time Ashton-Tate's cash cow, dBASE, was performing poorly in the market. dBASE IV for IBM PC compatibles was released the same year as FullWrite and customers were abandoning it for the various dBASE clones like FoxPro and Clipper. By 1990 Ashton-Tate was in serious financial trouble, and was eventually purchased by Borland in 1991. Work was underway on a cross- platform version of FullWrite, but Borland's purchase effectively ended all Mac development. In response, Ann Arbor Softworks (which still existed to serve customers of its other products) sued Borland, complaining that Ashton- Tate had failed to market the program successfully. The suit was dismissed, and analysts noted that had it gone forward, Borland and other large companies would be open to copy-cat suits from any disgruntled former developer.Jeff Ubois, \\"Ann Arbor suit against Ashton-Tate dismissed\\", MacWEEK, 17 February 1992 =Continued development= In late 1993 Borland sold off the product to Akimbo Systems, a small company started by Roy Leban, one of FullWrite's original developers. Akimbo immediately patched it to work on System 7, the latest Macintosh operating system at the time, and they released it as 1.7. A greatly updated FullWrite 2.0 (dropping \\"Professional\\") followed early in 1995,Carol Holzberg, \\"FullWrite Professional 2.0: full-featured and flexible\\", Computer Shopper News, 1 April 1995 adding a number of new features including AppleScripting, importers/exporters based on Claris's XTND, a built-in table editor, an extensive and powerful plug-in architecture (including a pig Latin plug-in), and support for the \\"EGO Protocol\\" which used AppleEvents to allow in-place editing of graphics. The most important \\"upgrade\\" was a major effort concentrating on performance and memory footprint, which was reduced by about 500 kb, allowing it to run somewhat smoothly in only 700 kb.Dan Littman, \\"The svelt FullWrite unveiled\\", MacWorld, October 1994 Reviews were very positive; now the main concerns were the odd menu layout that made some commands difficult to find, and the lack of a cascading style system.Tonya Engst, \\"FullWrite Upgrade\\", TidBits, 25 July 1994 The new version was fairly well received, but by this time, Microsoft Word's stranglehold on the Mac market was complete. Akimbo re-used the layout engine to produce a new HTML-editing tool known as Globetrotter Web Publisher, designed to allow people who did not know HTML to publish complete web sites, but it gained only a scant following. After several years of small sales, Akimbo decided to release FullWrite 2.0.6 as freeware in 1998 when the company shut down. Globetrotter was not similarly released because of its use of the GIF patent, for which Unisys insisted royalties be paid, even on free copies. =Opening legacy documents= Fullwrite only ran on macOS 7-9, and no version was ever written for Mac OS X. This left users with potentially hundreds or thousands of documents that can only be opened on an archaic operating system. Currently, LibreOffice is the only modern word processor that opens Fullwrite files on a modern Mac.

The first was on the night of 78 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941. 200 Luftwaffe bombers attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on London, this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during the Blitz. The third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 45 May 1941; 150 were killed. Incendiary bombs predominated in this raid. The fourth and final Belfast raid took place on the following night, 56 May. In total over 1,300 houses were demolished, some 5,000 badly damaged, nearly 30,000 slightly damaged while 20,000 required \\"first aid repairs\\".Barton, Brian, The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years (2015) p. 397. Background As the UK was preparing for the conflict, the factories and shipyards of Belfast were gearing up. Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the Luftwaffe. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK. Under the leadership of √âamon de Valera it had declared its neutrality during the Second World War. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with Axis nations: the German Legation in Dublin remained open throughout the war. =Government= The Government of Northern Ireland lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. James Craig, Lord Craigavon, had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. Richard Dawson Bates was the Home Affairs Minister. Sir Basil Brooke, the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need. John Clarke MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \\"Hiram Plan\\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible. It was MacDermott who sent a telegram to de Valera seeking assistance. There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations: * John Edmond Warnock, the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the government on 25 May 1940. He said, \\"I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction\\" and \\"the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic.\\" * Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gordon, Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. Chief Whip), resigned on 13 June 1940,http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html explaining to the Commons that the government was \\"quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face.\\" Craigavon died on 24 November 1940. He was succeeded by John Miller Andrews, then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He was replaced by 54-year-old Sir Basil Brooke on 1 May. =Manufacturing facilities= * Harland and Wolff was one of the largest shipbuilding yards in the world. It had constructed many ships for the White Star Line like and and for the Royal Navy, including aircraft carriers such as and ; the cruisers, and as well as 131 other naval vessels. Up to 35,000 people were employed. * During the war years, Belfast shipyards built or converted over 3,000 navy vessels, repaired more than 22,000 others and launched over half a million tons of merchant shipping ‚Äì over 140 merchantmen. * Short Brothers manufactured aircraft. They are best known for the Sunderland flying boat and the Stirling long-range heavy bomber. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 Handley Page Hereford bombers. * James Mackie & Sons were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of Bofors anti-aircraft shells. * Harland's Engineering works built tanks. They designed the Churchill. * Aero linen for covering aircraft, such as the Hawker Hurricane, and military glider frames, was manufactured by a number of Belfast flax spinning mills, such as The York Street Flax Spinning Co.; Brookfield Spinning Co.; Wm. Ewart's Rosebank Weaving Co.; and the Linen Thread Co. * Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, ordnance pieces, aircraft parts and ammunition. War materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Britain, some under the protection of the neutral Irish tricolour. The M.V. Munster, for example, operated by the Belfast Steamship Company, plied between Belfast and Liverpool under the tricolour, until she hit a mine and was sunk outside Liverpool. =Preparation= Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940. HMSO image Government preparation There was little preparation for the conflict with Germany. However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \\"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \\"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours' \\". His reply was: \\"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and Empire to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the Ulster people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\\" Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \\"a very definite German objective\\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.Barton, Brian, The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years 2015, p. 41-2. Air-raid shelters Belfast, the city with the highest population density per area in the UK at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \\"Belfast Blitz\\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were Anderson shelters, constructed of sheets of corrugated galvanised iron covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. No searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some barrage balloons positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti- aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and 16 heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational. Children Few children had been successfully evacuated. The \\"Hiram Plan\\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit. German preparation From papers recovered after the war, we know of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets: * Harland and Wolff * Die Tankstelle Conns Water * Short and Harland aircraft factory * The power station of Belfast * Rank & Co mill * Belfast waterworks * Victoria Barracks John Miller Andrews Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940‚Äì43. HMSO image =Earlier raids= There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the River Clyde in Glasgow or the cities of the northwest of England. On 24 March 1941, John MacDermott, Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \\"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There [is] ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\\" MacDermott would be proved right. The first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six Heinkel He 111 bombers, from Kampfgruppe 26, flying at , dropped incendiaries, high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. 13 died, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a factory floor for manufacturing the fuselages of Short Stirling bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over Downpatrick. The Luftwaffe crews returned to their base in Northern France and reported that Belfast's defences were, \\"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences. Easter Tuesday Blitz William Joyce (known as \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \\"Easter eggs for Belfast\\". Junkers Ju-88 On Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a football match at Windsor Park noticed a lone Luftwaffe Junkers Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead. That evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern France and the Netherlands and headed for Belfast. There were Heinkel He 111s, Junkers Ju 88s and Dorniers. At 10:40 pm the air raid sirens sounded. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including HMS Ark Royal were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting. Public buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, York Road railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the Antrim Road; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt). Streets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed. There was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the anti-aircraft batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5am. 55,000 houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the Blitz.Wills, (2007). That Neutral Island, page 213. A stray bomber attacked Derry, killing 15. Another attacked Bangor, killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary \\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\\". Since 1:45am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the railway telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35am, asking the Irish Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera for assistance. Human cost Over 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. 50,000 houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. 11 churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other primary sources, such as:- Jimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the V1 and V2 blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz; Emma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the Great War), who kept a diary; and Major Se√°n O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of Queen's University, Belfast, has written most on this topic. =Instructions= There were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes. Major O'Sullivan reported that \\"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\\" That night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant Shankill area, took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic Falls Road. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air- raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing. =Mortuary= The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. 255 corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.Barton, (1995). Northern Ireland in the Second World War, page 46. Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the Milltown and Belfast City Cemeteries. =Nurse Emma Duffin= Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in World War I, contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw: Major Se√°n O'Sullivan Major Se√°n O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \\"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \\"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\\" In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the Mater Hospital at 2 pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, (Theodore Thomson Flynn, an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor Errol Flynn), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \\"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\\" O'Sullivan reported: \\"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead ‚Äì heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\\". His report concluded with: \\"a second Belfast would be too horrible to contemplate\\". =Refugees= 220,000 people fled from the city. Many \\"arrived in Fermanagh having nothing with them only night shirts\\". 10,000 \\"officially\\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of Dromara saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In Newtownards, Bangor, Larne, Carrickfergus, Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. Major O'Sullivan reported on a: Moya Woodside noted in her diary: \\"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions. Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.\\" Dawson Bates informed the Cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas. Barton, (1995). Northern Ireland in the Second World War, page 49. =Newspaper reaction= The Irish Times editorial on 17 April: Aftermath =Southern reaction= By 6am, within two hours of the request for assistance, 71 firemen with 13 fire tenders from Dundalk, Drogheda, Dublin, and D√∫n Laoghaire were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived. Taoiseach √âamon de Valera formally protested to Berlin. He followed up with his \\"they are our people\\" speech, made in Castlebar, County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the Dundalk Democrat dated Saturday 26 April 1941): Frank Aiken, the Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. He gave an interview saying: \\"the people of Belfast are Irish people too\\". =German response= Initial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A Luftwaffe pilot gave this description \\"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever Churchill is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as Coventry, Birmingham, Bristol or Glasgow.\\" William Joyce \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\" announced that \\"The F√ºhrer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from Joseph Goebbels were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that Adolf Hitler, in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and Irish American politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. Eduard Hempel, the German Minister to Ireland, visited the Irish Ministry for External Affairs to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \\"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\\" He stated that \\"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\\". =Recriminations= The government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. Tommy Henderson, an Independent Unionist MP in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \\"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\\" A map showing the location of Belfast Lough US journalist Ben Robertson reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British. One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years, Brian Barton wrote: \\"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \\"too far north\\" to use radio guidance. Other writers, such as Tony Gray in The Lost Years state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of Belfast Lough, would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the IRA in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \\"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\\", \\"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the IRA Army Council to support Germany. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. However on 20 October 1941 the Garda S√≠och√°na captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and RAF Sydenham, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon p397Report by the Garda S√≠och√°na 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722 =Firemen return south= After three days, sometime after 6pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in Banbridge; others were entertained in the Ancient Order of Hibernians hall in Newry. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War, an invitation was received by the Dublin Fire Brigade for any survivors of that time to attend a function at Hillsborough Castle and meet Prince Charles. Only four were known still to be alive. One, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. =Second major raid= Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid There was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 45 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1am, Luftwaffe bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \\"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\\"Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941, Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011) were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'. Casualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45pm while the Luftwaffe attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.

He is one of the most prominent advocates of legal positivism and is well known for his conception of perfectionist liberalism. Raz spent most of his career as a professor of philosophy of law at the University of Oxford associated with Balliol College, and is now a part-time professor of law at Columbia University Law School and a part-time professor at King's College London. He received the prestigious Tang Prize for rule of law in 2018. Life and career Born in Mandatory Palestine in 1939, Joseph Raz graduated in 1963 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a Magister Juris (summa cum laude). Later, with funds provided by the Hebrew University, Raz pursued a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford under the supervision of H. L. A. Hart. Raz had met Hart earlier at a conference in Israel, impressing him by pointing out a flaw in his reasoning that had previously eluded him; Hart encouraged him to go to Oxford for further study. Raz studied at Balliol College and completed his DPhil in 1967. He then returned to Israel to teach at the Hebrew University as a lecturer in the Faculty of Law and Department of Philosophy. In 1971, he was tenured and promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 1972, he returned to Balliol as a Fellow and Tutor in Law, becoming a Professor of Philosophy of Law, Oxford University, from 1985 to 2006, and then a Research Professor from 2006 to 2009. Since 2002 he has also been a Professor in the Law School at Columbia University. Raz, now retired from Oxford, is currently also a research professor of law at King's College London. Philosophical work A pupil of H. L. A. Hart, Raz has been important in continuing the development of legal positivism both before and since Hart's death. Raz was also co-editor of a second edition of Hart's The Concept of Law with a postscript including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work. Raz's first book, The Concept of a Legal System, was based on his doctoral thesis. A later book, The Morality of Freedom won two prizes: the 1987 W.J.M. Mackenzie Book Prize from the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, awarded to the best book in political science each calendar year; and the 1988 Elaine and David Spitz Book Prize from the Conference for the Study of Political Thought, New York, awarded annually for the best book in liberal and/or democratic theory that had been published two years earlier. The book develops a conception of perfectionist liberalism. Raz has argued for a distinctive understanding of legal commands as exclusionary reasons for action and for the \\"service conception\\" of authority, according to which those subject to an authority \\"can benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their existence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very same issues which the authority is there to settle.\\" This, in turn, supports Raz's argument for legal positivism, in particular \\"the sources thesis\\", \\"the idea that an adequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only on social facts, and not on moral arguments.\\" Raz is acknowledged by his contemporaries as being one of the most important living legal philosophers. He has authored and edited eleven books to date, namely The Concept of a Legal System (1970), Practical Reason and Norms (1975), The Authority of Law (1979), The Morality of Freedom (1986), Authority (1990), Ethics in the Public Domain (1994), Engaging Reason (1999), Value, Respect and Attachment (2001), The Practice of Value (2003), Between Authority and Interpretation (2009), and From Normativity to Responsibility (2011). His most recent work deals less with legal theory and more with political philosophy and practical reasoning. In moral theory, Raz defends value pluralism and the idea that various values are incommensurable. Raz's work has been cited by the Supreme Court of Canada in such cases as Imperial Tobacco v. British Columbia and Sauv√© v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer). Several of Raz's students have become important legal and moral philosophers, including two current Professors in Jurisprudence at Oxford, Leslie Green and Timothy Endicott, and the former professor of Jurisprudence John Gardner.

The film was a starring vehicle for actress Marion Davies and actor William Haines and included notable cameo appearances by many of the film personalities of the day, including stars Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart and John Gilbert, and writer Elinor Glyn. Vidor also appears in a cameo as himself, as does Davies (to a decidedly unimpressed reaction by herself in character as Peggy Pepper). The film is a lighthearted look at Hollywood at the end of the silent film era (it was released the year after breakthrough talking picture The Jazz Singer), and is considered Davies' best role. Show People features no audible dialog but was released with a Movietone soundtrack with a synchronized musical score and sound effects. The film was re-released in the 1980s, with a new orchestral score by Carl Davis. In 2003, Show People was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". It is currently available on DVD on-demand as part of the Warner Archive collection. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. Plot Young Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) wants to be in motion pictures, so her father (Dell Henderson) drives her across the country from their home in Georgia to Hollywood. After some initial disillusionment, she meets Billy Boone (William Haines) in a studio commissary; he tells her to show up at his set if she wants work. Peggy goes, gets sprayed with seltzer water at her first entrance, and is at first shocked and dismayed to find she is doing slapstick comedy in low-budget \\"Comet\\" productions, but she decides to \\"take it on the chin\\" and, with Billy's loving support, becomes a success. Soon enough, Peggy is signed to a contract by the prestigious \\"High Art\\" studio and, as \\"Patricia Pepoire\\", becomes a real movie star. She has fulfilled her dream of playing serious, dramatic roles, but she cuts off contact with Billy and the old comedy troupe, and soon becomes so conceited that her boring performances begin to drive away her public. On the day of her marriage to her co-star, phony-count Andre Telfair (Paul Ralli), Billy bursts in and, by means of another spritz of seltzer in her face, as well as a custard pie in Andre's, brings her to her senses, rescuing her career and their mutual happiness.

The main character of Peggy Pepper, who becomes the self-important dramatic star, Patricia Pepoire, was based on the careers of silent divas Gloria Swanson and Mae Murray. When asked, Davies supposedly told Murray the character was based on Swanson. Davies also told Swanson the character was based on Murray, but Swanson did not care since she had no inclination to ever see the film. As such, the film is a comic romp for Davies. Lucille Ball frequently cited Davies as a major comedic influence, and Ball's facial techniques and comic behaviors evident in I Love Lucy are apparent in Davies' performance in this film. The character of Andre Paul Ralli was seen at the time as being a satire of John Gilbert.Contemporary \\"Variety\\" review The film has a remarkable number of cameo appearances from some of the top stars of the day, including Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Norma Talmadge, Leatrice Joy, Lew Cody, Eleanor Boardman, and others. Many agreed to appear out of friendship with Davies, Hearst, and director Vidor, and the positive publicity value of cooperating with Hearst and MGM also played a factor. Both Marion Davies and King Vidor also made cameo appearances as themselves.Lorusso, Edward (2017) The Silent Films of Marion Davies, CreateSpace, p. 159. In one of the film's most famous sequences, the script originally called for Davies to get hit in the face with a pie after being tricked appearing in a slapstick comedy movie. William Randolph Hearst objected to this, fearing for Marion Davies' dignity, and as a compromise the scene was changed (without Hearst's knowledge) to have Davies get hit in the face with spray from a seltzer bottle.\\"Show People\\" at TCM Vidor had wanted James Murray for the role of Billy Boone, but he was unavailable. Davies jumped at the chance to cast close friend William Haines in the role and even agreed to Haines' receiving billing above the title with her. This was the only silent film in which Davies shared star billing. Once again, the reviews raved about Davies' comedic touch, and the film was a huge hit at the box office.Lorusso, Edward (2017) The Silent Films of Marion Davies, CreateSpace, pp. 159-162. The closing scene on the set of a war movie may be a nod to King Vidor's The Big Parade, a smash hit made in 1925, but more closely resembles another Davies film: Marianne.

Its western terminus is at Route 25 in Clarkton, Dunklin County, and the route travels eastward to nearby towns of Gideon and Portageville, where it intersects U.S. Route 61 (US 61) and Interstate 55 (I-55). The road then continues through rural New Madrid County and ends at a boat ramp near the Mississippi River. The route was designated in 1956 to replace two supplemental routes that extended from Clarkton to Portageville. The route was fully paved in the same year, and an interchange was built at I-55 by 1967. Route description In 2015, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 1,888 vehicles traveling on Route 162 west of Route 153, and as few as 252 vehicles traveling east of Route M. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. The route is located in Dunklin and New Madrid counties. The route starts at a T-intersection with Route 25 on the western edge of Clarkton. It travels on the northern side of the city, and leaves city limits and Dunklin County past Shelton Drive. The road enters New Madrid County and travels through a small section of farmland before entering the city of Gideon. In the northern side of the city, the route meets Route 153 at a T-intersection, and it travels southward concurrently with Route 153. At Fourth Street, Route 162 travels eastward, ending the concurrency. The route passes by the entrance of the Gideon Memorial Airport, before leaving the city at County Road 279 (CRD 279). At CRD 268, the road begins to travel southeastward until it reaches CRD 272, crossing several streams along the way. Route B becomes concurrent with Route 162, crossing a river and intersecting two county roads before continuing southwards. The route crosses the Little River past CRD 357. At McCrate Avenue, Route 162 enters Portageville. The road travels across the northern part of the city, intersecting city streets and Route F. After crossing over the River Subdivision railroad, the road meets US 61 at a T-intersection and becomes concurrent. Both US 61 and Route 162 travel southwestward until the road reaches Main Street. At this point, US 61 and Route 162 travel eastward and crosses over the Portage Bayou, while Route T begins travelling southward. Just outside of Portageville, the road meets I-55 at a diamond interchange, and US 61 continues its concurrency with I-55. Route 162 continues eastward through rural New Madrid County. East of CRD 427, the road intersects the termini of Routes KK and TT. At Route M, Route 162 begins travelling southwestwards toward the Mississippi River. CRD 439 is the last intersection before the road ends at a boat ramp near the river. History Around 1932, Routes C and K were designated along gravel roads in the Missouri Bootheel. Route C connected from Route 25 in Clarkton to Gideon, while Route K was from Portageville to near the Mississippi River. Route K was extended southeastward one year later, intersecting the newly designated Route M. Route C was extended east of Gideon in 1935, and its section from Clarkton to Gideon was paved one year later. The section of Route C east of Gideon was paved by 1949, and the route was extended eastward by 1953. Route K was also paved during that time. By 1954, Route C was extended along a gravel road to Portageville, connecting with US 61 and Route K. In 1956, Route 162 was designated, replacing Routes C and K. The remaining gravel section and was paved that year. An interchange at I-55 was being built during 1967, and it was completed later that year. The project was part of the I-55 extension from New Madrid to Portageville, with a total cost of $6,375,556 in 1966.

He was the founder of Julius Poole & Gibson Pty Ltd and Automatic Totalisators Ltd, and invented the world's first automatic totalisator. Early years George Alfred Julius was born in a small house in Bethel Street, Norwich, England, (demolished in the 1930s to make way for the new City Hall). At that time his father, Churchill Julius (1847‚Äì1938), was a curate at St. Giles in Norwich. In 1873 the family moved firstly to the parishes of South Brent (now known as Brent Knoll) and thereafter to Shapwick and Ashcott in Somerset. Later, Churchill Julius became vicar of Holy Trinity, Islington, London; he subsequently accepted the appointment as Archdeacon of Ballarat, Australia and it was to here that the family travelled on the sailing ship \\"South Australian\\" in 1884. From an early age, George's mechanical inclination was obvious to his parents and he often helped his father to fix clocks, one of which survives (now decommissioned) in the tower at St. Michael's, Brent Knoll, although George would have been too young to have assisted with this particular repair! The family moved to New Zealand when Churchill Julius was nominated to the Diocese of Christchurch in 1889; he was consecrated (first) Bishop of Christchurch in 1890, and made Anglican Primate and (first) Archbishop of New Zealand in 1922. In 1890, George Julius enrolled in a BSc (Mechanical Engineering) degree course at Canterbury College. Because of the contemporary boom in railway construction, he specialised in railway engineering and was the first such engineering student to graduate from this university, at the same time as Ernest Rutherford, graduating through the University of New Zealand. Early career and the totalisator Julius's professional career began in 1896. He travelled to Western Australia to accept an appointment as assistant engineer on the staff of the Locomotive Department, Western Australian Government Railways. He worked for the Department for eleven years and was promoted to chief draughtsman and then engineer in charge of tests. While working for the Government Railways, George Julius conducted a series of tests on timber and wrote two learned papers on Western Australian hardwoods. This research led to a job offer from Allen Taylor & Co Ltd, a timber company in Sydney, as part- time engineer. Julius accepted this offer in 1907. In whatever spare time he had, George Julius worked on the design for an automatic totalisator. Helped by two of his sons, he built a prototype. However, the automatic totalisator was not originally conceived as a betting machine, but as a mechanical vote- counting machine. When the government rejected the voting machine concept, George Julius adapted it as a racecourse totalisator. The first installation of the totalisator was at Ellerslie Racecourse, Auckland, New Zealand in 1913, which was entirely manual in operation, and the second at Gloucester Park Racetrack in Western Australia, electrically driven. The patent was lodged on 21 December 1914. Subsequent orders kept the firm of Julius, Poole & Gibson solvent throughout the Great Depression, with the first UK installation in 1928, for greyhound racing and in 1932 the first American installation at Hialeah Park, Florida. Career progression One of the great contributions made by George Julius to the advancement of Australian technology resulted from his appointment, in 1926, as chairman to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). This later became the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), modelled on the UK's DSIR. He lobbied for development of primary production and solution to issues in such areas as food storage and food preservation. Later, he turned his attention to issues in secondary production such as aeronautics and electronics. During World War II, he served on the Central Inventions Board, the Australian Council for Aeronautics (as chairman) and the Army Inventions Directorate. George Julius was knighted in 1929.It's an Honour. itsanhonour.gov.au He remained active as a committee representative until his death on 28 June 1946. Family and legacy In 1898, he married Eva O'Connor, daughter of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, and they had three sons. The eldest, Awdry Francis Julius (born 1900), was later to become a partner in his father's firm. Another, George Yelverton Julius, was known as \\"Gentleman George\\". However, he brought his good upbringing into a life of crime. In 1953 he went to jail for eight years for burglary.Margot Hilton and Graeme Blundell (1996) Whiteley: An Unauthorised Life, MacMillan, , p. 34 He was the father of Wendy Whiteley, wife of the Australian painter Brett Whiteley, and his granddaughter was Arkie Whiteley. A third son died during a flight around Australia in a single-seater aeroplane. A road in the grounds of the CSIRO headquarters in Canberra is named in his honour.

It previewed new and upcoming lines and figures each month, as well as providing a price guide for toy lines, both new and old. ToyFare was also known for its satirical humor. Publication history The magazine began publication in 1997, initially borrowing many features which first appeared in its sister magazine, Wizard. It maintained a steady monthly schedule, reaching its 100th issue in December 2005. ToyFare featured alternative covers, first with issue #20, and subsequently was used with almost every issue after #57. Along with its sister publication, Wizard, ToyFare ceased publication on January 24, 2011.Melrose, Kevin (January 24, 2011). \\"Breaking: Wizard and ToyFare magazines fold\\". Comic Book Resources. The final issue published was #163. =Twisted ToyFare Theatre= The most popular feature in ToyFare was Twisted ToyFare Theatre (TTT), a humorous comic strip done by photographing toys on sets built by the magazine‚Äôs staff (this technique was likewise used for covers for much of the magazine's earlier run). The strips predominantly featured action figures produced by the Mego Corporation, toys popular in the 1970s, during the childhoods of much of the magazine‚Äôs staff. Most of the regular figures/characters featured in the strip were Marvel Comics characters, such as Spider-Man (popularly known as \\"Mego Spidey\\")Thomas, Jr., Dr. Ronald C. \\"Playing with Themselves: Robot Chicken and 'Twisted Toyfare Theatre,'\\" The New York Review of Science Fiction (Oct. 2010), pp. 17-19. and the Incredible Hulk. Twisted ToyFare Theatres popularity was such that Wizard Entertainment released several trade paperback collections of the strips. = The Monthly Rag = The magazine added \\"The Monthly Rag\\", a feature similar to supermarket tabloids, presenting parody articles using various toy and pop culture references. (An example would be an article reporting on the intelligent design debate on the planet Cybertron, home of the robotic Transformers). Originally, this feature's main articles were humorous exaggerations of actual toy-related stories (such as news of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series' release on DVD, reported as \\"Shocking He-Man Footage Made Public!\\"), and a sidebar column would appear somewhere within the \\"Monthly Rag\\" section with short summaries of the real news behind the exaggerated articles. Regular features * Monthly horoscopes with ridiculous or nonsensical predictions, supposedly written by Cobra Command hypnotist/interregator Crystal Ball (billed as \\"psychic to the famous toys\\"). * An advice column headed by a fictional character who, because of a specific situation or certain quirks in their personality, gives advice that ranges from useless to extremist to outright non-sequiturs. An example would be \\"Ask Anakin Skywalker, Burning in Lava\\" (a reference to the character's horrific fate at the end of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith); all of Skywalker's responses were non-sequiturs, primarily cries of pain and lamentations about his fall from grace. * A classified section featuring ads supposedly placed by various fictional celebrities, such as movie or TV characters and superheroes. * The \\"Page Sixteen Girl\\", a photo on said page of a \\"sexually appealing\\" female action figure, a parody of the Page Three Girl, a feature originating in the Rupert Murdoch-owned United Kingdom tabloid The Sun. * Parodies of comic strips, primarily drawn by Ryan Dunlavey, usually placing toy or other pop culture characters in the roles of an established comic strip, such as \\"Cringerfield\\", which placed the feline character Cringer from the Masters of the Universe mythos into a setting similar to that of the comic strip character Garfield (with He-Man in the role of Jon Arbuckle). Exclusive offers ToyFare featured mail-away offers for exclusive merchandise. At first it largely offered Toy Biz figures that had been repainted or slightly modified into other characters, though the magazine later went on to offer exclusive figures that ran the industry gamut, including figures from Jakks Pacific, Minimates, and HeroClix. Connection to Robot Chicken Several former ToyFare staffers, such as Doug Goldstein, Tom Root, and Matthew Senreich, went on to help create the Adult Swim program Robot Chicken with actor Seth Green, whose humor is in the same vein as Twisted ToyFare Theatre.

For this reason, electrovacuums are sometimes called (source-free) Einstein-Maxwell solutions. Mathematical definition In general relativity, the geometric setting for physical phenomena is a Lorentzian manifold, which is physically interpreted as a curved spacetime, and which is mathematically specified by defining a metric tensor \\\\, g_{ab} (or by defining a frame field). The Riemann curvature tensor \\\\, R_{abcd} of this manifold and associated quantities such as the Einstein tensor G^{ab}, are mathematically well-defined. In general relativity, they can be interpreted as geometric manifestations (curvature and forces) of the gravitational field. We also need to specify an electromagnetic field by defining an electromagnetic field tensor F_{ab} on our Lorentzian manifold. These two tensors are required to satisfy two following conditions # The electromagnetic field tensor must satisfy the source-free curved spacetime Maxwell field equations \\\\, F_{ab;c} + F_{bc;a} + F_{ca;b} = 0 and {F^{jb}}_{;j} = 0 # The Einstein tensor must match the electromagnetic stress- energy tensor, G^{ab}= 2 \\\\, \\\\left( F^{a}{}_{j}F^{bj}-\\\\frac{1}{4}g^{ab} \\\\, F^{mn} \\\\, F_{mn} \\\\right ). The first Maxwell equation is satisfied automatically if we define the field tensor in terms of an electromagnetic potential vector \\\\vec{A}. In terms of the dual covector (or potential one- form) and the electromagnetic two-form, we can do this by setting F = dA. Then we need only ensure that the divergences vanish (i.e. that the second Maxwell equation is satisfied for a source-free field) and that the electromagnetic stress-energy matches the Einstein tensor. Invariants As in flat spacetime, the electromagnetic field tensor is antisymmetric, with only two algebraically independent scalar invariants, : I = \\\\star ( F \\\\wedge \\\\star F ) = F_{ab} \\\\, F^{ab} = -2 \\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\ \\\\vec{E} \\\\^2 - \\\\\\\\vec{B} \\\\^2 \\\\right) : J = \\\\star (F \\\\wedge F) = F_{ab} \\\\, {\\\\star F}^{ab} = -4 \\\\, \\\\vec{E} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{B} Here, the star is the Hodge star. Using these, we can classify the possible electromagnetic fields as follows: # If I < 0 but J = 0, we have an electrostatic field, which means that some observers will measure a static electric field, and no magnetic field. # If I > 0 but J = 0, we have an magnetostatic field, which means that some observers will measure a static magnetic field, and no electric field. # If I = J = 0, the electromagnetic field is said to be null, and we have a null electrovacuum. Null electrovacuums are associated with electromagnetic radiation. An electromagnetic field which is not null is called non-null, and then we have a non-null electrovacuum. Einstein tensor The components of a tensor computed with respect to a frame field rather than the coordinate basis are often called physical components, because these are the components which can (in principle) be measured by an observer. In the case of an electrovacuum solution, an adapted frame : \\\\vec{e}_0, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_1, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_2, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_3 can always be found in which the Einstein tensor has a particularly simple appearance. Here, the first vector is understood to be a timelike unit vector field; this is everywhere tangent to the world lines of the corresponding family of adapted observers, whose motion is \\"aligned\\" with the electromagnetic field. The last three are spacelike unit vector fields. For a non-null electrovacuum, an adapted frame can be found in which the Einstein tensor takes the form : G^{\\\\hat{a}\\\\hat{b}} = 8 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon \\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} 1&0&0&00&1&0&00&0&1&00&0&0&-1\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] where \\\\epsilon is the energy density of the electromagnetic field, as measured by any adapted observer. From this expression, it is easy to see that the isotropy group of our non-null electrovacuum is generated by boosts in the \\\\vec{e}_3 direction and rotations about the \\\\vec{e}_3 axis. In other words, the isotropy group of any non-null electrovacuum is a two-dimensional abelian Lie group isomorphic to SO(1,1) x SO(2). For a null electrovacuum, an adapted frame can be found in which the Einstein tensor takes the form : G^{\\\\hat{a}\\\\hat{b}} = 8 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon \\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} 1&0&0&\\\\pm 1 0&0&0&00&0&0&0 \\\\pm 1 &0&0&1\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] From this it is easy to see that the isotropy group of our null electrovacuum includes rotations about the \\\\vec{e}_3 axis; two further generators are the two parabolic Lorentz transformations aligned with the \\\\vec{e}_3 direction given in the article on the Lorentz group. In other words, the isotropy group of any null electrovacuum is a three-dimensional Lie group isomorphic to E(2), the isometry group of the euclidean plane. The fact that these results are exactly the same in curved spacetimes as for electrodynamics in flat Minkowski spacetime is one expression of the equivalence principle. Eigenvalues The characteristic polynomial of the Einstein tensor of a non-null electrovacuum must have the form : \\\\chi(\\\\lambda) = \\\\left( \\\\lambda + 8 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon \\\\right)^2 \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\lambda - 8 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon \\\\right)^2 Using Newton's identities, this condition can be re-expressed in terms of the traces of the powers of the Einstein tensor as : t_1 = t_3 = 0, \\\\; t_4 = t_2^2/4 where : t_1 = {G^a}_a, \\\\; t_2 = {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_a, \\\\; t_3 = {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_c \\\\, {G^c}_a, \\\\; t_4 = {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_c \\\\, {G^c}_d \\\\, {G^d}_a This necessary criterion can be useful for checking that a putative non-null electrovacuum solution is plausible, and is sometimes useful for finding non-null electrovacuum solutions. The characteristic polynomial of a null electrovacuum vanishes identically, even if the energy density is nonzero. This possibility is a tensor analogue of the well known that a null vector always has vanishing length, even if it is not the zero vector. Thus, every null electrovacuum has one quadruple eigenvalue, namely zero. Rainich conditions In 1925, George Yuri Rainich presented purely mathematical conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for a Lorentzian manifold to admit an interpretation in general relativity as a non-null electrovacuum. These comprise three algebraic conditions and one differential condition. The conditions are sometimes useful for checking that a putative non-null electrovacuum really is what it claims, or even for finding such solutions. Analogous necessary and sufficient conditions for a null electrovacuum have been found by Charles Torre. Test fields Sometimes one can assume that the field energy of any electromagnetic field is so small that its gravitational effects can be neglected. Then, to obtain an approximate electrovacuum solution, we need only solve the Maxwell equations on a given vacuum solution. In this case, the electromagnetic field is often called a test field, in analogy with the term test particle (denoting a small object whose mass is too small to contribute appreciably to the ambient gravitational field). Here, it is useful to know that any Killing vectors which may be present will (in the case of a vacuum solution) automatically satisfy the curved spacetime Maxwell equations. Note that this procedure amounts to assuming that the electromagnetic field, but not the gravitational field, is \\"weak\\". Sometimes we can go even further; if the gravitational field is also considered \\"weak\\", we can independently solve the linearised Einstein field equations and the (flat spacetime) Maxwell equations on a Minkowksi vacuum background. Then the (weak) metric tensor gives the approximate geometry; the Minkowski background is unobservable by physical means, but mathematically much simpler to work with, whenever we can get away with such a sleight-of-hand. Examples Noteworthy individual non-null electrovacuum solutions include: *Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m electrovacuum (which describes the geometry around a charged spherical mass), *Kerr‚ÄìNewman electrovacuum (which describes the geometry around a charged, rotating object), *Melvin electrovacuum (a model of a cylindrically symmetric magnetostatic field), *Garfinkle‚ÄìMelvin electrovacuum (like the preceding, but including a gravitational wave traveling along the axis of symmetry), *Bertotti‚ÄìRobinson electrovacuum: this is a simple spacetime having a remarkable product structure; it arises from a kind of \\"blow up\\" of the horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m electrovacuum, *Witten electrovacuums (discovered by Louis Witten, father of Edward Witten). Noteworthy individual null electrovacuum solutions include: *the monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave, an exact solution which is the general relativitistic anague of the plane waves in classical electromagnetism, *Bell‚ÄìSzekeres electrovacuum (a colliding plane wave model). Some well known families of electrovacuums are: *Weyl‚ÄìMaxwell electrovacuums: this is the family of all static axisymmetric electrovacuum solutions; it includes the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m electrovacuum, *Ernst‚ÄìMaxwell electrovacuums: this is the family of all stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum solutions; it includes the Kerr-Newman electrovacuum, *Beck‚ÄìMaxwell electrovacuums: all nonrotating cylindrically symmetric electrovacuum solutions, *Ehlers‚ÄìMaxwell electrovacuums: all stationary cylindrically symmetric electrovacuum solutions, *Szekeres electrovacuums: all pairs of colliding plane waves, where each wave may contain both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation; these solutions are null electrovacuums outside the interaction zone, but generally non-null electrovacuums inside the interaction zone, due to the non-linear interaction of the two waves after they collide. Many pp-wave spacetimes admit an electromagnetic field tensor turning them into exact null electrovacuum solutions.

Plot The Intellivision game catalog features the exciting caption, \\"Spin. Blast. And drop into hyperspace to avoid a killer asteroid shower. Power on. Attack computer engaged. Fire a quick burst at the alien antagonists. Got 'em!\\"Intellivision game catalog, Mattel Inc. (1982).intellivisionlives.com The actual package gives a more specific description: \\"You're in command of a battery of laser guns. You have unlimited ammo and a lot of targets! You can roll up big scores by hitting a spectactular barrage of falling rocks, bombs, guided missiles and attacking UFOs...\\" Gameplay A laser cannon defends the Earth from a meteor shower. Astrosmash resembles a cross between Space Invaders and Asteroids. The player controls a laser cannon that can scroll left or right along a flat plane in order to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, large or small spinning bombs, and guided missiles, as well as a UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels. Low hills and stars are seen in the background. There are four types of targets, each of which may move at a range of speeds. As the game advances, the range of speeds for each type of target increases.Astrosmash Cartridge Instructions, Mattel Inc. (1981). #The bulk of the targets are meteors, which come in two sizes and various colors. Both sizes fall vertically when entering the screen. Large meteors may be destroyed with a direct hit, or may split into two smaller meteors, which fall diagonally in opposite directions. Small meteors are destroyed with a single hit. #The player must also shoot spinning bombs, or spinners, which are white, come in two sizes, and spin while falling vertically. Each spinner emits a loud whistling sound, which gradually lowers in pitch as it approaches the ground. #Guided missiles appear occasionally as white dots making a pulsing sound, and may fall diagonally toward the player's initial location, or track the laser cannon as it moves left and right. If a missile reaches the ground, it may disappear, or it may continue to track left or right, and can only be avoided by entering hyperspace. The missile may change directions several times before disappearing. #UFOs cross the screen occasionally, beginning at level 4, firing non-guided salvos aimed at the player's laser cannon. The player loses a laser cannon each time it is hit by a falling meteor, a guided missile, a non-guided salvo, or by shrapnel from a nearby explosion, and any time a spinner reaches the ground, even if it does not strike the gun. Each target hit increases the player's score; it decreases by half as much each time a meteor reaches the ground, or a laser cannon is destroyed. An extra gun is awarded each time the player's peak score increases by 1,000 points. The game has six levels, each of which features increased speed and scoring. Each level is represented by a differently-colored background. Level 1, up to 999 points, is black; level 2, from 1,000 to 4,999 points, is blue; level 3, from 5,000 to 19,999 points, is purple; level 4, from 20,000 to 49,999 points, is turquoise; level 5, from 50,000 to 99,999 points, is gray; and level 6, above 100,000 points, is black again. Speed continues to increase along with the player's peak score, at 200,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 points. The player has the option of firing single shots by pressing the fire buttons, or switching to automatic fire at a rate of three shots per second. The hyperspace option moves the gun to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point. The game can also be paused at any time. Development Astrosmash cartridge inserted and the overlay on the left controller Astrosmash was conceived when a game called Meteor!, an Asteroids clone, did not fill up the ROM space of an entire cartridge. The extra space was used to create a variation of the game called Avalanche! The Meteor! game was cancelled at the last minute, due to concerns that it was too similar to Asteroids.Brett Weiss, Classic Home Video Games, 1972‚Äì1984: A Complete Reference Guide, McFarland (2007). Programmer John Sohl programmed a \\"branch\\" around the opening-screen menu, leading directly to the Avalanche! variation, retitled Astrosmash. The games were compatible, since they were designed together, and used the same sprites and sound effects. In rare instances, if the console's reset button is pressed rapidly, an error can occur, resulting in the game starting in the original Meteor! format. Mattel released the game for the Atari 2600. Renamed Astroblast, it has faster play than the Intellivision original. Reception Astrosmash was reviewed in 1982 by Video magazine where it was described as \\"an obvious attempt to provide Intellivision-ites with a solitaire arcade-style target game\\". The pacing of the early stages in the game was described as \\"dull and plodding\\", although later in the game the pace becomes much more challenging. The color-coding of stages corresponding with difficulty level and player score was described as \\"not a bad idea\\", but reviewers noted that \\"the greyish blue used for the 1000-to-4999-point range is especially odious\\" and described this hue as \\"assaulting the optic nerves\\". Despite the lackluster review, the game was ultimately recommended as \\"probably worth a try\\" for Intellivision users seeking a new experience because the Intellivision \\"traditionally lacks arcade programs\\", and eight months later in Videos 1982 Guide to Electronic Games, Astrosmash was described as \\"probably the most popular action game produced by Mattel for play on the Intellivision\\".

History The line was a success and provided a major portion of Mauritania's GDP; as a result the line was nationalised in 1974. Following Mauritania's annexation of southern Western Sahara in 1976, the line came under constant attack by Polisario militia, effectively putting the line out of use and thereby crippling Mauritania's economy. This played a major role in prompting the army to overthrow Mauritanian president Moktar Ould Daddah in 1978, followed by a withdrawal from Western Sahara the following year. With the line now secure, repairs were conducted and trains starting using it once again in the early 1980s. This railway is unusual for its usage of the Soviet type coupler SA-3, which is quite rare in non ex-Soviet countries. Traffic Mauritania Railway train at the station in Nouadhibou Trains on the railway are up to in length, making them among the longest and heaviest in the world. They consist of 3 or 4 diesel-electric EMD locomotives, 200 to 210 cars each carrying up to 84 tons of iron ore, and 2-3 service cars. The total traffic averages 16.6 million tons per year. Passengers are also occasionally transported by train; these services are managed by an SNIM subsidiary, the soci√©t√© d'Assainissement, de Travaux, de Transport et de Maintenance (abb. ATTM).http://www.attm.mr/index.php/entreprise/presentation Passenger cars are sometimes attached to freight trains, but more often passengers simply ride atop the ore hopper cars freely. Passengers include locals, merchants, and rarely some tourists. Conditions for these passengers are incredibly harsh with daytime temperatures exceeding 40¬∞C and death from falls being common.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiRD3GcjmKk&t;=521s In January 2019, the railway resumed tourism after a ten year hiatus; part of the track ran through a forbidden tourist area. One of the stops on the tourist route is an iron mine. The tourist route is typically operated by a locomotive carrying two passenger carriages.  Locomotives  In October 2010, SNIM ordered six EMD SD-70ACS locomotives, with special modifications for operating in high temperatures.  Glencore Xstrata  In 2014, the mining company Glencore paid $1 billion for 18 years of access to SNIM's rail and port infrastructure, which would be connected to branch lines to new iron mines at Askaf and Guelb El Aouj. The deal would have saved the company the cost of constructing their own tracks and facilities. http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11332401.htm However, Glencore backed out of the project just one year later after the price of iron ore tumbled nearly 40%.

He was the originator of the use of twisted rubber to power model aircraft, and his 1871 model airplane, which he called the Planophore, was the first aerodynamically stable flying model. He went on to design a full-sized aircraft with many advanced features, but was unable to get any support for the project, and eventually committed suicide in 1880, aged 30. Top to bottom: 1870 helicopter 1871 'Planophore 1873 ornithopter Biography P√©naud was born in Paris into a naval family, his father Charles P√©naud being an admiral in the French Navy. Because of a hip disease he walked with the aid of crutches and so was unable to attend the Naval School. At 20, he began studying aviation and joined the newly founded Soci√©t√© A√©ronautique de France. He became vice-president of the Society in 1876 and participated in the publication of the journal L'A√©ronaute. In 1870 P√©naud made the first of a series of successful model helicopters. The principle of this was not new, having been demonstrated to the French Academy of Sciences in 1784 by M. Launoy, a naturalist, and M. Bienvenu,http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Chanute/library/Prog_Screws_Mar1892.html and was known by Sir George Cayley, but it was the first use of twisted rubber to power a flying model. During the early years of the development of heavier- than-air flight, many experimenters were to use this method of propulsion for experimental models, including Lawrence Hargrave and A.V. Roe. =Planophore= The next year he built the Planophore, which was to be a major influence on early aircraft design. In addition to the use of a twisted rubber motor driving a pusher propeller, this machine introduced two important principles to practical aeronautics: the wings were curved upwards at the tips, in effect having dihedral, and the rear-mounted horizontal stabiliser was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings. Both of these design features gave the planophore a degree of automatic stability.Gibbs-Smith 2003 p.56 The principle of dihedral had been worked out by Sir George Cayley, although at the time P√©naud was not aware of Cayley's work. The principle of a difference in the angle of incidence between the main lifting surface and the stabiliser was worked out for the first time by P√©naud. The Planophore was successfully flown at the Tuileries Gardens in Paris in front of members of the Soci√©t√© A√©ronautique on 18 August 1871, flying a distance of and staying in the air for 11 seconds. The Planophore was 51 cm (20 in) long with a wingspan of 46 cm (18 in) and a wing area of 0.05 m¬≤ (0.53 ft2) with a two- bladed propeller 20 cm (8 in) in diameter. It weighed 16 g (0.56 oz), of which the rubber accounted for 5 g (0.17 oz).Octave Chanute, Progress in Flying Machines =Later work= The following year he produced a rubber-driven ornithopter. Both the helicopter and the ornithopter enjoyed some success as toys. In 1873 he started collaborating with an engineer named Paul Gauchot, and produced two designs for full-sized aircraft, the first in 1874 and the second in 1876. The 1876 aircraft was drawn in detail for the purpose of patenting the ideas it incorporated, and had many remarkably advanced features, including electrically operated elevators, a fully enclosed cabin for the pilot, a retractable undercarriage, and the use of a pair of propellers rotating in opposite directions to eliminate the torque reaction caused by a single propeller. He also participated in lighter than air experimentation, and produced a number of ingenious devices, including a differential barometer to show the rate of ascent or descent. Alphonse P√©naud was unable to obtain any financial backing for his ambitious design and committed suicide on 22 October 1880, aged 30. Influence *P√©naud's experiments were comprehensively described by Octave Chanute in his book Progress in Flying Machines. * A helicopter of the P√©naud type was given to the Wright Brothers by their father in 1878. The Wright brothers would later mention it as an early inspiration for their interest in flight. *P√©naud is one of the unsuccessful aviation pioneers mentioned in the Marc Blitzstein composition The Airborne Symphony.

Nilson was born and grew up in a peasant region in Sk√•ne, the southernmost province of Sweden. He became a construction worker in 1906, by which time he had already become a class conscious young socialist. Amalthea bombing In the summer of 1908 the workers in the docks of Malm√∂ went on strike for better conditions. The police and military were called in to keep order, and the employers took in British workers to do the job. This was considered highly provocative by the striking Swedish workers. The British workers were temporarily living on a ship called Amalthea. On the night between 11 and 12 July, three young unemployed workers, including Anton Nilson, put a bomb outside Amalthea, without considering the danger to the workers sleeping aboard. The bomb exploded, killing one and wounding 23 of the British workers, who were sleeping on the deck rather than in their cabins. The name of the Englishman killed by the explosion was Walter Close. Neither Close's family nor the injured British workers received a penny in compensation nor an apology. Anton Nilson was sentenced to death. His two accomplices Algot Rosberg and Alfred Stern were sentenced to penal labour for life. Amalthea after the attack Before his execution, Anton Nilson was pardoned and, like the others, given forced labour for life. His execution would have been the first since 1900 and, apart from that of Alfred Ander, no more capital sentences were executed until abolition in 1921. The first reactions in Sweden to the bomb attack on the Amalthea were those of horror and disgust followed by condemnation, including from the wider workers' movement. However, after a while public opinion sided with Anton Nilson, Algot Rosberg and Alfred Stern, and a massive campaign was launched to have them freed. Thousands of international meetings were held in their support, including some 600 meetings amongst workers in the United States, organised by the Industrial Workers of the World and with Joe Hill as a leading participant. A petition containing some 130,000 names was handed to the government and Supreme Court of Sweden, asking for the release of the three young men. An attempt to free Anton Nilson by force from the prison in H√§rn√∂sand took place on May Day 1917, when 10,000 workers marched to the jailhouse. Guards with machine guns were stationed on the walls and the military was called in. The prison guards were ordered to shoot Anton Nilson if necessary rather than letting him escape. Eventually the masses demonstrating outside the prison gave up and walked away. Finally, in October 1917, Anton Nilson and his two compatriots received a full pardon. It was the first decision made by Nils Ed√©n's appointed coalition government of Liberals and Social Democrats, which under the following two years would institute democracy and women's suffrage in Sweden. In the Russian Revolution The grave of Anton Nilson and his wife decorated on the 100th anniversary of the Amalthea bombing As Anton Nilson was released from jail, the Bolshevik Revolution had just started in Russia. Without hesitation, and nowhere else to go, Nilson went to visit Russia in company with the Swedish communist leader Ture Nerman. Anton Nilson decided to join the Red Army, fighting as a pilot in the civil war. Nilson helped organize the air defense of Moscow, later taking command of the air force on the Baltic Front. For his services his comrades elected him to receive an award from Leon Trotsky. At the rise of Stalinism, Anton Nilson decided to return to Sweden in 1926. He would always consider Stalin as a traitor to the revolution, saying: \\"Stalin took the state police, which had been formed against the counter-revolution, and turned it against socialists....\\"Nilson, A. Memoirs of a Revolutionary ‚Äì The rise of Stalinism ‚Äì Militant 674 ‚Äì 4 November 1983 p6 and an adherent to the fascist model of a police state. His departure from the Soviet Union may well have saved him from the Great Purges during the 1930s. When Nikita Khrushchev took over the leadership of the Soviet Union after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, Anton Nilson considered it a positive development. For the rest of his life, Nilson toured Sweden agitating for Swedish Communist rule. He also became revered as one of the Swedish Labour Movement's heroes, and his portrait is still today to be found at the headquarters of Landsorganisationen. His 100th birthday, during which Anton Nilson himself held a speech lasting for several hours, was celebrated by several Social Democratic members of the Swedish Cabinet. Anton Nilson lived to be 101 years old, surviving his death sentence by over 80 years - a record for adult offenders - and dying only months short of the fall of the Berlin wall. Of the Soviet Old Bolsheviks, he outlived all but Lazar Kaganovich, his junior by several years. Although Nilson expressed \\"regret\\" at his trial that he had killed and injured, he is not recorded as ever having apologised to the injured, or to the family of the dead English strikebreaker.

This point in time called the closing is when the title to the property is conveyed (transferred) to the buyer. Closing costs are incurred by either the buyer or the seller. Examples of typical closing costs *Attorney (Lawyer) Fees, paid by either or both parties, for the preparation and recording of official documents. The principals and/or lender may each be represented by their own attorney. Typically required by institutional/commercial lenders to ensure documents are prepared correctly. *Title Service Cost(s), paid by either party according to the contract but by default seller may pay the majority, for title search, title insurance, and possibly other title services. In some cases the attorney may do the title search or the title service and attorney fees may be combined. Required by institutional/commercial lenders and often by the real estate contract. *Recording Cost, paid by either party, charged by a governmental entity for entering an official record of the change of ownership of the property. Required by the government for recording the deed. *Document or Transaction Stamps or Taxes, paid by either or both parties depending on location (area of jurisdiction), charged by a governmental entity as an excise tax upon the transaction. Required by law. *Survey Fee for a survey of the lot or land and all structures on it, paid by either party, to confirm lot size and dimensions and check for encroachments. Required by institutional/commercial lenders. *Brokerage Commission, paid by the seller to a Real Estate Broker, to compensate the Broker(s) involved in the sale for their services in marketing the property, finding a buyer, and assisting in the negotiations. Brokerage commissions are usually computed as a percentage of the sale price, and are established in a listing agreement between the seller and the listing broker. The listing broker may offer Buyer Agents a portion of their commission as an incentive to find buyers for the property. Payment is required if real estate brokerage service was used. This is often one of the largest closing costs. *Mortgage Application Fees, paid by the buyer to the lender, to cover the costs of processing their loan application. In some cases, the buyer would pay the lender the application directly and prior to closing, while in other cases the fee is part of the buyer's closing costs payable at closing. *Points, paid by the buyer to the lender but may be reimbursed by the seller. Points are a form of pre-paid interest, charged by the lender as an alternative to charging a higher rate of interest on the mortgage loan. One point equals one percent of the loan principal, and usually reduces the interest rate by 1/8% (0.125). *Appraisal Fees, usually paid by the buyer (although occasionally by the seller through negotiation), charged by a licensed professional Appraiser. Many lenders will require that an appraisal be performed as a condition of the mortgage loan. The purpose of this appraisal is to verify that the sale price of the property (upon which the underwriting of the loan is based) is equal to or less than the fair market value of the property. *Inspection Fees, usually paid by the buyer (although occasionally by the seller), charged by licensed home, pest, or other inspectors. Some lenders require inspections (such as termite inspection) to verify that the property is in good condition, which is necessary to assure that the property will retain the necessary collateral value to secure the mortgage loan. During a typical transaction in the United States, inspection fees are paid at time of service and not closing, however. *Home Warranties, paid by either the buyer or the seller. Warranties are available on resale homes insuring major household systems against repair or replacement for the buyer's initial year of ownership. Sellers will sometimes offer these warranties as a marketing strategy to give buyers \\"peace of mind\\", or buyers can elect to purchase them just prior to closing. *Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), paid by the buyer but may be reimbursed by the seller. Lenders will typically require that a mortgaged property be insured if the Down payment is less than 20 percent, and will usually require that the first full year's mortgage insurance premium (MIP) be paid in advance by the buyer. If the buyer has not already paid the insurance company directly, this would become another closing cost payable at closing. The buyer can request cancellation of PMI once their equity reaches 20 percent of the market value, and the lenders are required to automatically cancel the PMI once the equity reaches 22 percent by federal laws. *Pre-paid Homeowner's Property Insurance, paid by the buyer in advance to protect the home against fire, earthquake, flood (normally a separate policy from other hazard insurance), theft, and other casualties. The lender will require this coverage. Flood insurance may or may not be required, depending on the location. *Pro-rata property taxes, paid by the seller, the buyer, or both. Most (but not all) jurisdictions assess taxes on real property, which are usually payable at a specified date annually. Since all but a tiny fraction of real estate transactions close on a date other than this one specified annual date, most transactions must include an adjustment to assure that both the seller and the buyer end up paying their share of the annual property tax, proportionate to the percentage of the year that each has ownership of the property. Usually required by institutional/commercial lenders and by the real estate contract. *Pro-rata Homeowner Association Dues, paid by the seller, buyer, or both. If the property is covered by a Homeowner Association (HOA), the HOA will normally be funded by dues assessed against each property owner. Again, since the ownership of the seller and buyer are each fractional in the year of the transaction, there must be an adjustment made so that each owner pays their proportional share. Often required by institutional/commercial lenders and by the real estate contract. *Pro-rata Interest, paid by the buyer but may be reimbursed by the seller. The monthly mortgage payment is calculated and payable on a specified day each month. If the closing does not actually fall on that specified date (which is usually the case), then an adjustment must be made to calculate the interest on the loan for the number of extra days until the first payment is due. Other items in addition to the above may be common in some jurisdictions, and some transactions may include unusual or unique items as closing costs. In the United States, federal law requires that all residential transactions financed by a mortgage have all closing costs documented in detail upon the standard HUD-1 form. This information must be provided to the principals but does not have to be sent to the government. Instead a Declaration or Statement by Buyer and/or Seller is often required to be provided to the government office recording the deed. Form 1099-S may be required to be sent to the United States Internal Revenue Service, but Federal law does not allow a charge for this.

It has been designated as a National Nature Reserve. The name Gordano comes from Old English and is descriptive of the triangular shape of the whole valley from Clevedon to Portishead, being the ablative singular of the Latinised form of Gorden meaning muddy valley. The valley runs roughly north-east to south-west, between Carboniferous limestone ridges extending along the coastline between Clevedon and Portishead, and another ridge extending between Clevedon and Easton in Gordano. The area includes the villages of Clapton in Gordano, Weston in Gordano, Easton in Gordano, Walton in Gordano, Portbury and Sheepway. The M5 motorway runs along the south side of the valley, splitting briefly into two levels - the south-west-bound level running above the north- east-bound carriageway. The Gordano motorway service station is at the eastern end of the valley, near the Royal Portbury Dock and the Avonmouth Bridge. There is no river Gordano - much of the valley is reclaimed land barely above sea level, and it is drained by ditches (known in the area as \\"rhynes\\"). The rhynes previously managed by the now amalgamated Gordano Valley Internal Drainage Board are now the responsibility of the North Somerset Internal Drainage Board.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1910‚Äì14, and again from 1915-22. He was a Liberal, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. McPherson was born in Forest, Ontario, the son of Dougald McPherson, and was educated in the neighbouring area. He began work as an apprentice with the Forest Free Press in 1893. He moved to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba in 1896 and worked as a printer and later foreman there, in Neepawa and in Fort William, Ontario. From 1889 to 1901, he was manager and editor for the Weekly Manitoba Liberal in Portage la Prairie. In 1901, McPherson bought that paper and then, in 1903, the Daily Graphic, merging the two. In 1905, he established the Fort William Herald with R.G. McCuish. He became editor of the Winnipeg Western Editor in 1911. He served as president of the Western Canada Press Association in 1906-07, and was secretary of the Lakeside Liberal Association from 1902 to 1910. He also became secretary of the Portage St. Andrew Society in 1909. He served as lieutenant and captain in the 12th Manitoba Dragoons from 1904 to 1908, and later as Major of the 18th Mounted Rifles from 1908 until 1913, when he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. McPherson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1910 provincial election, defeating Conservative incumbent Edwin D. Lynch by 68 votes in the Lakeside constituency. Manitoba was governed by Rodmond Roblin's Conservative Party in this period, and McPherson served as an opposition member for the next four years. In the 1914 election, he lost to Conservative candidate John J. Garland by ten votes. Early in 1915, the Roblin government was forced to resign from office amid a corruption scandal. The Liberals won a landslide majority in the 1915 provincial election. McPherson was returned for the Lakeside constituency, defeating Garland by 163 votes. He did not serve in the legislature at its convening, however, having been previously called to active service in World War I. McPherson travelled with the first Canadian contingent to England at the start of the war, but was called home again to take second command of the 32nd Battalion. Promoted to the officer class at Shornecliffe, he was the first Canadian officer to tour the western front before Canadian soldiers were sent into the area. He served in France for twenty months as second-in-command of the 28th Battalion. He received command of the 31st Alberta Battalion in 1917, and led this battalion at the Battle of Passchendale. McPherson was twice decorated for his war service. He returned to Manitoba after the war to take his seat in the legislature, and served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government. The Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1920 provincial election. McPherson was re-elected in Lakeside, defeating Conservative E. Herbert Muir by 23 votes. On January 20, 1921, he was appointed to Norris's cabinet as Minister of Public Works. During this period of Canadian history, newly appointed ministers were required to resign their seats and seek the renewed consent of their electorate to assume office. The resulting by-elections were often formalities, as many ministers were unopposed following their appointments. McPherson, however, was forced to contest another challenge from Muir, who was now campaigning as a Farmer's candidate. McPherson won by 156 votes, and continued to serve in cabinet. In the 1922 provincial election, McPherson left the Lakeside constituency to challenge Conservative party leader Fawcett Taylor in Portage la Prairie. Taylor won the challenge in a close contest, defeating McPherson by 129 votes. The Liberals were defeated provincially by the United Farmers of Manitoba, and McPherson resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Norris ministry on August 8, 1922. Last years/death He moved to Vancouver, British Columbia in April 1946. McPherson died there in 1970.

A tetrameric protein is a protein with a quaternary structure of four subunits (tetrameric). Homotetramers have four identical subunits (such as glutathione S-transferase), and heterotetramers are complexes of different subunits. A tetramer can be assembled as dimer of dimers with two homodimer subunits (such as sorbitol dehydrogenase), or two heterodimer subunits (such as hemoglobin). Subunit interactions in tetramers The interactions between subunits forming a tetramer is primarily determined by non covalent interaction. Hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions are the primary sources for this binding process between subunits. For homotetrameric proteins such as Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), the structure is believed to have evolved going from a monomeric to a dimeric and finally a tetrameric structure in evolution. The binding process in SDH and many other tetrameric enzymes can be described by the gain in free energy which can be determined from the rate of association and dissociation. The following image shows the assembly of the four subunits (A,B,C and D) in SDH. Hydrogen bonds between subunits Hydrogen bonding networks between subunits has been shown to be important for the stability of the tetrameric quaternary protein structure. For example, a study of SDH which used diverse methods such as protein sequence alignments, structural comparisons, energy calculations, gel filtration experiments and enzyme kinetics experiments, could reveal an important hydrogen bonding network which stabilizes the tetrameric quaternary structure in mammalian SDH. Tetramers in immunology In immunology, MHC tetramers can be used in tetramer assays, to quantify numbers of antigen- specific T cells (especially CD8+ T cells). MHC tetramers are based on recombinant class I molecules that, through the action of bacterial BirA, have been biotinylated. These molecules are folded with the peptide of interest and Œ≤2M and tetramerized by a fluorescently labeled streptavidin. (Streptavidin binds to four biotins per molecule.) This tetramer reagent will specifically label T cells that express T cell receptors that are specific for a given peptide-MHC complex. For example, a Kb/FAPGNYPAL tetramer will specifically bind to Sendai virus specific cytotoxic T cell in a C57BL/6 mouse. Antigen specific responses can be measured as CD8+, tetramer+ T cells as a fraction of all CD8+ lymphocytes. The reason for using a tetramer, as opposed to a single labeled MHC class I molecule is that the tetrahedral tetramers can bind to three TCRs at once, allowing specific binding in spite of the low (10-6 molar) affinity of the typical class I-peptide-TCR interaction. MHC class II tetramers can also be made although these are more difficult to work with practically. Homotetramers and heterotetramers A homotetrameric complex, beta-glucuronidase (a glycosidase). Each subunit has the same amino acid sequence. The heterotetrameric molecule haemoglobin, made up of four subunits of two different types (coloured red and blue.) A homotetramer is a protein complex made up of four identical subunits which are associated but not covalently bound. Conversely, a heterotetramer is a 4-subunit complex where one or more subunits differ. Examples of homotetramers include: *enzymes like beta-glucuronidase (pictured) *export factors such as SecB from Escherichia coli *magnesium ion transporters such as CorA. *lectins such as Concanavalin A *IMPDH and IMPDH2 Examples of heterotetramers include haemoglobin (pictured), the NMDA receptor, some aquaporins, some AMPA receptors, as well as some enzymes. =Purification of heterotetramers= Ion-exchange chromatography is useful for isolating specific heterotetrameric protein assemblies, allowing purification of specific complexes according to both the number and the position of charged peptide tags. Nickel affinity chromatography may also be employed for heterotetramer purification. =Intragenic complementation= Multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene often can form an aggregate referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. When a mixed multimer displays increased functionality relative to the unmixed multimers, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation. In humans, argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is a homotetrameric enzyme that can undergo intragenic complementation. An ASL disorder in humans can arise from mutations in the ASL gene, particularly mutations that affect the active site of the tetrameric enzyme. ASL disorder is associated with considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity which is considered to reflect the extensive intragenic complementation occurring among different individual patients.

History and antiquities The natural site was used for a promontory fort ('cliff castle') in the Iron Age and the narrow neck of land was further excavated on the landward side with a central causeway, still visible. The eastern part retains traces of round house platforms, though damaged by wartime construction.Cornovia, Ancient sites of Cornwall & Scilly, 400BC - 100 AD, Craig Weatherill, 2009, Halsgrove The headland has a prominent chapel, dedicated to St Michael, as are many early Christian headland sites in the region, accessible by a steep footpath. The chapel was first licensed for Mass in 1397 and is on the site of a much earlier and ancient, Celtic, hermitage. It remains as an intact shell and was originally lime-washed so that it stood out on the headland. Ordwulf, who was the owner of vast estates in the West Country and was the uncle of King Ethelred the Unready, gave Rame to Tavistock Abbey (which Ordwulf had founded) in 981, meaning the parish was technically in Devon until the modern period. Rame Head in modern times Around the head, Dartmoor ponies are kept to graze. This area is also frequented by deer, sheep and cattle which can often be viewed from the sea. Due to its exceptionally high and panoramic vantage point, there is a volunteer National Coastwatch Institution lookout on the top of the headland (next to the car park). Rame Head is a part of Mount Edgcumbe House and Country Park which is jointly owned and run by Cornwall Council and Plymouth City Council. The headland is prominent to sailors and fishermen leaving Plymouth through Plymouth Sound. It is often the last piece of land they see leaving England, and the first they see when returning home; Rame Head thus appears in the sea shanty \\"Spanish Ladies\\".

The team's previous promotion was 40 years before that. Their stadium, the all-seater Balƒ±kesir Atat√ºrk Stadium, has a capacity of 13,732.  Tourism  Balƒ±kesir have coastlines both Sea of Marmara and Aegen Sea. Edremit, Burhaniye, G√∂me√ß and Ayvalƒ±k are the districts which are popular for their beaches, located in the Aegean coast of the Balƒ±kesir; Marmara Island, Erdek, G√∂nen and Bandƒ±rma are the districts that are located in the Marmara coast of Balƒ±kesir. √ñren, Ak√ßay and Altƒ±noluk are also among the holiday towns which attract vacationers interested in a holiday with scenery and historical, archaeological sites. The Ku≈ü Cenneti National Park near Lake Manyas is an ornithological site where 266 different species of birds flourish ‚Äì every year over three million birds fly through there. 13 km southeast of Bandƒ±rma in Karacabey, horse farms breed magnificent specimens of this majestic animal. Once known as ancient Erteka, Erdek is just 14km northwest of Bandƒ±rma. = Thermal tourism = Balƒ±kesir and its districts, besides the wealth of thermal resources, have healing waters with high quality of physical and chemical compositions. Many spas with health-promoting features surround the city, including Pamuk√ßu and Ilƒ±ca. The center of the city also contains the historical Turkish \\"Pasha Hamami\\" bath, which is still in use. Some of these thermal resources located in; Pamuk√ßu, Kiraz, Edremit-G√ºre, Edremit-Bostancƒ±, Edremit-Derman, G√∂nen, G√∂nen-Ek≈üidere, Manyas-Kƒ±zƒ±k K√∂y, Susurluk-Kepekler, Balya-Daƒü, Bigadi√ß-Hisark√∂y, Sƒ±ndƒ±rgƒ±- Hisaralan, Sƒ±ndƒ±rgƒ±-Emendere and Dursunbey-A≈üaƒüƒ±musalar Village. Transportation and accommodation Balikesir Terminal A bus in Balƒ±kesir Balƒ±kesir is a city that has shores on the Aegean and Marmara Seas. It is easy to reach from Ankara, ƒ∞stanbul, Bursa and ƒ∞zmir by motorway or railway. There are regular coaches from ƒ∞stanbul, Ankara and ƒ∞zmir. Balƒ±kesir has many small coastal towns. To make transportation comfortable, railway transport is done between Ankara-Balƒ±kesir and ƒ∞zmir-Balikesir at specific hours. Balƒ±kesir is joined to Bursa and ƒ∞zmir by a quality motorway. Also, there is the K√∂rfez Airport. On account of the K√∂rfez Airport, Balƒ±kesir Coach Terminal is out of the city so that there is servicing by the municipality to the city centre. On the other hand, the Railway Station is at Republica Square. Directly, from Ankara to Balƒ±kesir, there are three flights per week. In Balƒ±kesir city, there are ten hotels with one five-star hotel. A campus bus in Balƒ±kesir. University students use these buses.  Climate  Balƒ±kesir has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) under both the K√∂ppen and Trewartha classification. Winters are cool and wet with frequent frosts and occasional snowfall, and summers are hot and dry. The continental climate is effective as it moves from west to east and north to south. Therefore, winters are cold and snowy in the inner parts. On the Marmara coast, the effect of the Black Sea climate is seen. Therefore, the summers are warm here. Because of Turkey's geographical conditions, one can not speak about a general overall climate. In Istanbul and around the sea of Marmara (Marmara region) the climate is moderate (winter 4¬∞C and summer 27¬∞¬∞C); in winter the temperature can drop below zero. In Western Anatolia (Aegean region) there is a mild Mediterranean climate with average temperatures of 9¬∞C in winter and 29¬∞C in summer.

They digitise reel-to-reel field tapes, have a mass data store and use international standards for metadata description. Paradisec is part of the worldwide community of language archives (Delaman and the Open Language Archives Community). Paradisec's main motivation is to ensure that unique recordings of small languages are themselves preserved for the future, and that researchers consider the future accessibility to their materials from other researchers, community members, or anyone who has an interest in such materials. Vanishing Voices As the number of small languages in the world is reduced by many factors (urbanization, colonial policies, the speakers' desire to learn languages which give access to resources), the tapes which may be their only record become increasingly more valuable. Too many of these recordings are held in poor conditions and are not described in a public catalog. PARADISEC provides the infrastructure to deposit and locate these recordings. Archive The collection currently contains roughly 7,800 hours of archived audio materials representing more than 1,100 languages from around 100 countries. This is supplemented by significant numbers of images, videos and text objects. Altogether, the archive contains some 33.5 terabytes of data in more than 163,021 individual files (correct at September 2017). The database of archived materials can be freely searched via the Open Languages Archives Community. Direct access to archived recordings requires registration and sometimes needs permission as specified by the depositor. File Types For the secure archival of audio files complete with metadata headers, PARADISEC uses the Quadriga system, developed by Cube-Tec, which conforms to the BWF specifications of the European Broadcast Union (EBU). BWF files are archived with a digitally sealed 'header' comprising metadata exported from the Paradisec catalog. This sealed header also acts as a security device and prevents the archived BWF from any unauthorised edits, thus preserving the audio signal for posterity. It is also standard practice to produce smaller, more easily transported mp3 copies of each BWF, for the purpose of access. These too, are archived with the master BWF copies. Digitisation A large part of the project is the digitisation of valuable analogue recordings of languages and cultures from the Pacific region that will otherwise deteriorate and become unreadable. Researchers whose materials are represented in these collections include Arthur Capell, Stephen Wurm, Clemens Voorhoeve and Terry Crowley. These recordings may be stored on a variety of formats, but are mainly cassette tapes and reel-to-reel tapes. Analogue recordings are digitised at the highest possible fidelity to ensure high-quality digital files result. The current international archive standard for PCM audio files is 24-bit resolution and a sample rate of 96 kHz. PARADISEC employs a standard of 24-bit resolution and 96 kHz sample rate to ensure highest practicable fidelity digital copies are produced. Affiliations Paradisec is funded by a consortium of four Australian universities, including the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne and the Australian National University, as well as the Australian Research Council and Grangenet. Paradisec's main office and primary ingestion stations are located at the University of Sydney in the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and a secondary office, comprising further ingestion stations, is situated at the University of Melbourne. The archive is currently headed by Linda Barwick and Nicholas Thieberger.

Background The parents of several children with autism brought an action against the British Columbia government for failing to fund Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA/IBI), a form of therapy for children with autism. Both at trial and in the British Columbia Court of Appeal the Court found that the children's equality rights (under section 15) were violated.  Ruling  The Court unanimously decided that the refusal to fund the ABA/IBI treatment did not violate the children's section 15 equality rights. McLachlin, writing for the Court, reiterated that the question here is whether the petitioners were denied a benefit in a discriminatory manner (see Law test). However, here, she claimed, the benefit of \\"funding for all medically required treatment\\" is not guaranteed by law, as it is neither promised in the Canada Health Act nor any provincial health legislation. Rather, the Health Act only guarantees funding for core services of which ABA/IBI for autism is not one. The Court further rejected the possibility that autistics were adversely discriminated against by the underinclusiveness of the legislation. Non-core medical services, McLachlin stated, are by their very nature underinclusive and cannot be considered discriminatory. For a claim to succeed the petitioner must establish a comparator group from which differential treatment must be shown. In this case, the Court identified the comparator group as a person who is not suffering from a mental disability who wants funding for an emergent or experimental treatment. As the petitioners were unable to show that other seekers of experimental treatments are guaranteed funding, the Court rejected the claim on this basis as well.

He was born Roger Waagner in North Dakota. He was an escaped fugitive during the spring, summer and fall of 2001 and was the FBI's 467th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list for carjackings, firearms violations, and bank robbery on September 21, 2001. He was placed on the United States Marshals Service Top 15 Fugitives list for sending more than 280 letters that claimed to contain anthrax, which he mailed to Planned Parenthood with return addresses of the Marshals Service and the Secret Service beginning in October 2001. He is currently in prison. Prior crimes Waagner had previously been sentenced to 4‚Äì10 years for attempted robbery in 1992. Years later as a convicted felon released from prison, early in September 1999, he was pulled over by the Pennsylvania State Police, but fled into the woods and evaded capture, leaving behind a stolen car that contained firearms, explosives, false identity papers, and a list of abortion clinics. Later in September 1999, while on a self-described \\"Mission from God\\", he took his wife and their nine children on a cross-country road trip headed west in a stolen Winnebago, planning to murder various abortion doctors, beginning with one in Seattle, Washington. However, after crossing into Illinois his vehicle broke down, and Waagner was arrested when Illinois State Police stopped to investigate. Waagner was convicted on charges of interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle and for being a convicted felon in possession of firearms. While he was awaiting sentencing and facing a term of 15 years to life, Waagner escaped from DeWitt County Jail in Clinton, Illinois, on February 22, 2001. Escaped fugitive crime trail As an escaped fugitive felon from Clinton Illinois, Waagner made his way back east to Pennsylvania, where three months later he became wanted for the bank robbery of a First Union in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in May 2001. His fugitive trail then led southwest, where he was next identified as having abandoned a vehicle in Memphis, Tennessee, following a hit and run accident. Authorities recovered law enforcement-type equipment, anti-abortion literature, and weapons from the car. He next became wanted for carjackings across the state line in Tunica, and Robinsonville, Mississippi, and firearms violations in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 7, 2001. Later that month, the FBI placed him on the list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Anthrax hoax Waagner then became most infamous for a hoax in November 2001, in which he sent envelopes containing a white powder to more than 500 abortion providers. The envelopes also contained a note, which said, \\"You have been exposed to anthrax. We are going to kill all of you. From the Army of God, Virginia Dare Chapter.\\" The threat was considered serious, as it arrived shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks on America, as well as the then-recent delivery of genuine anthrax letters to various governmental officials. A United States Marshals Service Top 15 Fugitive since March 6, 2001, Waagner also became a FBI Ten Most Wanted fugitive because of the more than 280 letters that threatened to contain anthrax, which he mailed to Planned Parenthood, with return addresses of the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Secret Service beginning in October 2001. In the wave of mailed letters, Waagner was accused of stalkings and threats to kill 42 low-level abortion clinic employees up through November 23, 2001. On November 29, 2001, the FBI took the unusual step of releasing a press release of new information about Waagner seeking the public's assistance, while also pointing out that Waagner's letters were not associated with the recent letters that had been sent to the offices of Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy which actually did contain anthrax. The white powder in Waagner's letters initially tested positive for anthrax, due to the addition of a powdered insecticide known to trigger false positive results. Capture and conviction He was captured on December 5, 2002, after a clerk at a Kinko's copy shop in Springdale, Ohio, identified him from a photograph on a wanted poster circulated by members of the United States Marshals Service. Waagner had been known to patronize Kinko's stores in the past, and for this reason the Marshals sent a copy to every store in the chain. When arrested, he was preparing to fax a bomb threat to a mass list of clinics. In addition to his earlier 15 years to life sentence in Illinois, he was convicted April 18, 2002, in Cincinnati, Ohio's U.S District Court on separate firearms and car theft charges. For the anthrax letter spree, he received a 53-count indictment, and on December 3, 2003, he was convicted on 51 of the 53 counts, including charges of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, threatening the use of weapons of mass destruction, and mailing threatening communications. He was sentenced to 19 years in a federal prison. Prison Waagner is currently serving in FCI Cumberland, a medium security federal correctional institution in Cumberland Maryland with a projected release date of February 3, 2045.

Ligamentous laxity is a cause of chronic body pain characterized by loose ligaments. When this condition affects joints in the entire body, it is called generalized joint hypermobility, which occurs in about ten percent of the population, and may be genetic. Loose ligaments can appear in a variety of ways and levels of severity. It also does not always affect the entire body. One could have loose ligaments of the feet, but not of the arms. Someone with ligamentous laxity, by definition, has loose ligaments. Unlike other, more pervasive diseases, the diagnosis does not require the presence of loose tendons, muscles or blood vessels, hyperlax skin or other connective tissue problems. In heritable connective tissue disorders associated with joint hyper-mobility (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome types I‚ÄìIII, VII, and XI), the joint laxity usually is apparent before adulthood. However, age of onset and extent of joint laxity are variable in Marfan syndrome, and joint laxity may be confined to the hands alone, as in Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome type I. In addition, ligamentous laxity may appear in conjunction with physical co- ordination conditions such as Dyspraxia. Presentation While ligamentous laxity may be genetic and affect an individual from a very early age, it can also be the result of an injury. Injuries, especially those involving the joints, invariably damage ligaments either by stretching them abnormally or even tearing them. Loose or lax ligaments in turn are not capable of supporting joints as effectively as healthy ones, making the affected individual prone to further injury as well as compensation for the weakness using other parts of the body. Afflicted individuals may improve over time and lose some of their juvenile hyperlaxity as they age. Individuals over age 40 often have recurrent joint problems and almost always have chronic pain. Back patients with ligamentous laxity in the area of the spine may also experience osteoarthritis and disc degeneration. In the case of extreme laxity, or hypermobility, affected individuals often have a decreased ability to sense joint position, which can contribute to joint damage. The resulting poor limb positions can lead to the acceleration of degenerative joint conditions. Many hypermobility patients have osteoarthritis, disorders involving nerve compression, chondromalacia patellae, excessive anterior mandibular movement, mitral valve prolapse, uterine prolapse and varicose veins. =Symptoms= Arthralgia, or symptoms such as frequent sprained ankles, shoulder dislocations, knee effusions and back problems are common among individuals with ligamentous laxity. Afflicted individuals are also prone to bone dislocation, and those with a sedentary job often report back pain. In addition, people may experience referred pain, that is, pain in an area of the body away from the injured or otherwise affected site. Individuals with extremely lax, or hypermobile joints, can be identified by their ability to bend their elbows, knees or hips past a position of neutrality. They may also be able to easily touch their hands flat to the floor while bending forward from the waist. The ability to touch the thumb to the forearm is also common. Referred pain is created by ligamentous laxity around a joint, but is felt at some distance from the injury. (Pain will not only occur at the site of the injury and loose ligaments, but may also be referred to other parts of the body.) These painful points that refer pain elsewhere are called trigger points, and will be dealt with later. Abnormal joint movement also creates many ‚Äúprotective actions‚Äù by adjacent tissues. Muscles will contract in spasm in an attempt to pull the joint back to the correct location or stabilize it to protect it from further damage. When this occurs in the back, orthopedic surgeons will often try to reduce vertebral instability by fusing the vertebrae with bone and/or metal fixation. =Feet= Those who have loose ligaments in the legs and feet may appear to have flat feet. While their feet have an arch when not supporting weight, when stood upon, the arch will flatten. This is because the loose ligaments cannot support the arch in the way that they should. This can make walking and standing painful and tiring. Pain will usually occur in the feet and lower legs, but can also spread to the back due to abnormal standing and walking habits. Wearing shoes that have good arch support can help minimize the discomfort. The underlying problem, however, is not solved by wearing shoes with arch supports, or worsened by wearing shoes without arch support. There is currently no cure for the condition. In addition, people with ligamentous laxity often have clumsy or deliberate gaits, owing to the body having to overcompensate for the greater amount of energy required to offset the weakened ligaments. The feet may be spread apart at a wide angle, and the knees may flex backwards slightly after each stride. Those who have this disease may experience sprained ankles more frequently than other people. Cause In most people, ligaments (which are the tissues that connect bones to each other) are naturally tight in such a way that the joints are restricted to 'normal' ranges of motion. This creates normal joint stability. If muscular control does not compensate for ligamentous laxity, joint instability may result. The trait is almost certainly hereditary, and is usually something the affected person would just be aware of, rather than a serious medical condition. However, if there is widespread laxity of other connective tissue, then this may be a sign of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Ligamentous laxity may also result from injury, such as from a vehicle accident. It can result from whiplash and be overlooked for years by doctors who are not looking for it, despite the chronic pain that accompanies the resultant spinal instability. Ligamentous laxity will show up on an upright magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the only kind of MRI that will show soft tissue damage. It can be seen in standing stress radiographs in flexion, extension, and neutral views as well, and also digital motion X-ray, or DMX. An advantage to having lax ligaments and joints is the ability to withstand pain from hyperextension; however, this is also a disadvantage as a lack of perceived pain can prevent a person from removing the ligament from insult, leading to ligament damage. People with hypermobile joints (or \\"double-jointed\\" people), almost by definition, have lax ligaments.

Best known for his successful tag teams, Brunzell performed for various wrestling promotions during his 21-year career. Early life The son of a navy pilot, Brunzell lived in Memphis for a time as a child. Brunzell attended high school in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, where he participated in multiple sports including American football, scholastic wrestling, and athletics. He was a state champion in the high jump while in high school. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he continued to play football and high jump. During college, he had a tryout with the Washington Redskins as a tight end. He then returned to college to finish his degree. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1972‚Äì1985)= Following his unsuccessful tryout with the Redskins, Brunzell was approached by former college football teammate Greg Gagne, who convinced him to train as a professional wrestler. He trained with Gagne's father Verne, alongside wrestlers including Ric Flair, Ken Patera, and The Iron Sheik. He began wrestling in various territories in the early 1970s, most notably in the NWA Central States promotion. There, he teamed with Mike George to win the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship on October 25, 1973. Following this, he returned to Minnesota and joined Gagne's promotion, the American Wrestling Association (AWA). He formed a tag team with Greg Gagne known as The High Flyers. The duo won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on July 7, 1977, by defeating Blackjack Lanza and Bobby Duncum. They held the championship for more than a year, until September 23, 1978, when they were stripped of the championship as Brunzell had suffered an injury. In 1979, Brunzell transferred to the Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW) promotion, where he twice won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. He returned to the AWA in 1981, and on June 14, The High Flyers regained the championship by defeating The East-West Connection (Jesse Ventura and Adrian Adonis). In the mid-1980s, Brunzell wrestled in Montreal for International Wrestling. =World Wrestling Federation (1985‚Äì1993)=  Killer Bees (1985-1988)  Brunzell signed to wrestle with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as they continued their national expansion. He was paired with another WWF newcomer, Brian Blair (though, Blair had already wrestled in the WWF before) as The Killer Bees. The Killer Bees were faces, but were original as the first faces to wear masks and switch places behind the referee's back. Brunzell and Blair had moderate success in the WWF. They feuded with such teams as The Hart Foundation as well as the Funks, Jimmy Jack Funk and Hoss Funk, whom they faced in front of over 74,000 fans at The Big Event. Their stay was also highlighted with a match against Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik as part of WrestleMania III, and a win at the inaugural Survivor Series on Thanksgiving Day 1987. The Killer Bees teamed together until they were separated off-screen by the management team. Their final match came against The Young Stallions on August 28, 1988.  Singles competition (1988-1993)  Following the breakup of Killer Bees, Brunzell was immediately programmed into a house show series with the newly arrived Curt Hennig that began in September, and began working mainly as a jobber. Brunzell was winless against Mr Perfect, including a singles match that aired on Prime Time Wrestling on October 4, 1988. On September 24, Brunzell gained his first victory in a nascent singles career when he defeated Danny Davis in Lexington, KY. The following month Brunzell was shifted to house show matches against another newly arrived wrestler in the WWF, Terry Taylor. Again, Brunzell was winless in competition against Taylor, as well as King Haku. Brunzell was still known for one of the best dropkicks in the WWF, and in a losing match against Randy Savage, the Macho Man got a bloody mouth after getting hit by one. On the November 5, 1988 edition of Prime Time Wrestling Jim Brunzell was announced as a participant in the Survivor Series, replacing Don Muraco. His former partner B. Brian Blair was also placed on the show, replacing The Junkyard Dog. Despite this seeming boost, Brunzell continued to struggle on television. He was defeated again by Curt Hennig on Prime Time Wrestling, as well as by King Haku. At the 1988 Survivor Series Brunzell was pinned by Bad News Brown; however, his team did come out victorious. After this Brunzell took a sabbatical from the company. In 1989 Brunzell would only wrestle twice in the WWF, defeating \\"Iron\\" Mike Sharpe in June and losing to Bad News Brown in November. The following year he made a full-time return and defeated Frenchy Martin on his first match back on February 18, 1990 in Chicago, IL. Brunzell however was now an opening level wrestler, albeit one with strong name recognition. He entered into an unsuccessful house show series with Rick Martel in April, while making his return to television on the May 14 edition of Prime Time Wrestling in a match against Curt Hennig. As he entered the summer he would appear on television against Dino Bravo and The Orient Express. On the July 16, 1990 edition of Prime Time he finally gained his first televised victory since the breakup of the Killer Bees when he pinned Black Bart. All traces of his former Killer Bees gimmick were now gone, and Brunzell would wear tie-dye trunks, adopted the \\"Crank It Up\\" theme song that had been used by The Young Stallions and was still being used by Jim Powers. It was with Powers that Brunzell would team with on August 9, 1990 on Prime Time Wrestling against Power and Glory (Powers's only televised match against his former partner). This month was also Brunzell's most successful since 1988, as he scored victories against Buddy Rose, Steve Lombardi, and Bob Bradley. He continued to fare well against opening level competition throughout the fall and winter. Brunzell's appearances became much more limited in 1991 as he wrestled only seventeen dates, all winless efforts against upper level competition like Irwin R. Schyster, The Warlord, and The Barbarian. However in 1992 he became a regular again and made his first television appearance in over a year when he appeared in a battle royal that aired on Prime Time Wrestling on April 20. Brunzell began tag-teaming consistently again for the first time in almost four years when he replaced the departed Jim Neidhart and teamed with Owen Hart. Hart and Brunzell were victorious in multiple encounters against The Beverly Brothers in March. Brunzell also received a non-title match against WWF World Champion Ric Flair on the March to WrestleMania show. The teaming with Owen was short-lived, and Brunzell returned to singles competition as spring commenced. Brunzell was victorious in two dark match tryouts for Rochester Roadblock in April, and appeared in a 40 man battle royal that aired on Prime Time Wrestling in June 1992. That month Brunzell began teaming with Jim Powers once more, losing to The Beverly Brothers and The Nasty Boys, and defeating Duane Gill and Barry Hardy. Later that summer he returned once more to singles competition, facing Paul Diamond, Skinner, and Steve Lombardi. On October 5, 1992 edition of Prime Time Wrestling Brunzell faced Terry Taylor in the latter's return to the WWF. On the January 3, 1993 edition of Prime Time Wrestling Brunzell received a shot against Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. A day later he wrestled on the international version of WWF Superstars and scored his first televised victory of the year when he pinned Bill Irwin. In February 1993 he was programmed into a house show series against The Predator (Horace Hogan) and was again victorious in every encounter. However despite hoping to work for the WWF as a producer/booker for the WWF, he wrestled his final WWF match in April 1993, episode of Monday Night Raw where he was defeated by newcomer Damien Demento. =Independent circuit= Brunzell left WWF in 1993 and competed on the independent circuit, primarily in the Chicago area. He also wrestled for Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) in 1991. While there, he reunited with B. Brian Blair under the name Masked Confusion, winning the tag team title twice. After the UWF closed, Brunzell returned to the independent circuit and continued to wrestle until the mid-1990s, but still making sporadic appearances in the late-1990s and early 2000s. On May 23, 1993, Brunzell wrestled at World Championship Wrestling's inaugural Slamboree pay-per-view in a six-man tag match alongside fellow \\"legends\\" Wahoo McDaniel and Blackjack Mulligan against Dick Murdoch, Don Muraco, and \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka. In 1994, he appeared in the American Wrestling Federation as a guest referee in a bout for the AWF Heavyweight Championship, in which Tito Santana beat Bob Orton Jr. to win the title. Brunzell wrestled his final professional wrestling match in 1999 on the \\"Wrestle America 2000\\" event held on Crystal, Minnesota against The Hater in a winning effort for Brunzell. Personal life Since retiring from wrestling, Brunzell works in sales. Brunzell is involved in his local church and does charity work for children with diabetes. In July 2016, Brunzell was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. As of November 2017, Blair and Brunzell work many Comic-Cons and Independent Autograph Sessions. A Comic Book Series called the \\"Killer Bees\\" has been released.

Awards were presented in the areas of sci-fi, fantasy and horror films, television series and video games. Some of the awards were voted on by the viewers choice and the others by SPACE employees. The awards were known for their use of humor, often with skits built around both the presenting and the receiving of awards. Rather than hosting a formal ceremony, SPACE instead took the awards to the winners, often visiting them on the set of their latest production, or in some other setting. Richard Dean Anderson of Stargate SG-1 was noted for his comedic acceptance speeches (one of which during the 2nd Spacey Awards ran so long it was run in installments throughout the broadcast). Anderson was not nominated for the 4th annual awards as he was no longer a cast member of Stargate. Instead, he presented an award to the actor who replaced him on Stargate via an extended art film parody of My Dinner with Andre. The Spacey Awards were produced by Michelle Dudas and Simon Evans. The awards were hosted by Natasha Eloi and Jonathan Llyr, with Kim Poirier becoming co-host with the 2005 awards. She appeared at the first Spacey Awards too. A special The Best of the Spaceys, hosted by Eloi, Llyr and Poirier, showing clips from past awards aired on May 18, 2007.

The Court decided that distribution of casino profits to a select group of aboriginals is not discriminatory. The leading case on section 15(2) is now R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41.  Background  In a deal made in the early 1990s, the Ontario government gave control of reserve-based gaming activities to several First Nations bands. By 1996 the government enacted the First Nations Fund which restricting the distribution of the profits from the on-reserve casinos to First Nation bands registered under the Indian Act. The petitioners were a group of non-registered First Nations bands who were status Indians. The claimed that they were discriminated against by the government under section 15(1) of the Charter. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled against the First Nations bands. The Court ruled that an exception under section 15(2) could be made for any discrimination claims as the purpose of the law was to improve the social and economic conditions of the registered bands.  Opinion of the Court  The unanimous Court decisions was given by Iacobucci J. in which he ruled that the claimants failed to establish that the purpose of the First Nations Fund was based on a stereotype. There was a clearly established ameliorative purpose to the fund that did not coincide with the claimants' needs and circumstances. Iacobucci further examined the purpose of section 15(2). He described it as \\"confirmatory and supplementary\\" to section 15 jurisprudence. That is, the section must not be applied separately from section 15(1); rather, it should be used as a guide when analysing claims under section 15(1). Nevertheless, he left open the possibility of different applications of section 15(2) for future cases.

It was released as a single CD, a 7\\" vinyl (the limited edition 7\\" comes with a golden glitter clear vinyl and an accompanying picture sleeve), and as a cassette. B-sides \\"Goldfinger\\" was released with three b-sides. The first B-side, \\"I Need Somebody\\", has a \\"big band\\" feel, and was written by Mark Hamilton while he was in hospital. \\"I Need Somebody\\" features on Ash's first B-sides collection, \\"Cosmic Debris\\". The second B-side, \\"Sneaker\\", was originally titled \\"Easter Island\\" and was co-written by Mark Hamilton & Barry Peak of Backwater while Mark and Rick were involved in a side-project band called Sneaker. Sneaker (the band) featured Rick McMurray on guitar, Mark Hamilton on bass, Barry Peak on guitar and vocals, and Shaun Robinson on drums. \\"Easter Island\\" was only released on a compilation of Irish bands called Laugh Hard At The Absurdly Evil, and unlike Ash's version of the song, is slower and has clear vocals. Shortly after, Ash took \\"Easter Island\\" and recorded it, giving it the title \\"Sneaker.\\" Ultimately, it is a fast-paced grunge song with roaring guitars and distorted vocals. It also appears on \\"Cosmic Debris\\". It was played live occasionally during Ash's Trailer & 1977 tours.

The song has continually been responded to well over the years, as to many the song represents the heady-days of Brit-pop-Era Britain.

Hamzy also received attention for her claim that she was propositioned by Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas. Claims Hamzy claims to have given oral sex to various members of the many bands that have traveled through Little Rock. Her alleged groupie escapades were detailed in a Cosmopolitan profile in 1974, and in 1992 she wrote a tell-all article for Penthouse. She is mentioned in Grand Funk Railroad's song \\"We're an American Band\\" (\\"Last night in Little Rock, put me in a haze / Sweet, sweet Connie, doin' her act / She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.\\") Hamzy published a memoir in 1995 under the title Rock Groupie: The Intimate Adventures of \\"Sweet Connie\\" from Little Rock. In 1991, Hamzy was briefly in the news because of her claim that in 1984 she had been approached by an Arkansas state trooper on behalf of Bill Clinton. She claimed that she and Clinton had looked for \\"a place where they could have some privacy for an assignation, but couldn't find one.\\" George Stephanopoulos later recounted that Clinton told him a different story of his meeting with Hamzy. According to Clinton, Hamzy had approached him in a hotel lobby, flipped down her bikini top, and asked him, \\"What do you think of these?\\" Stephanopoulos secured affidavits from three people who had been accompanying Clinton and confirmed Clinton's recollection. When asked about Hamzy by reporters, Stephanopoulos responded by denying the story off the record and offering to provide the affidavits, also off the record. Although CNN Headline News reported Hamzy's allegations once, neither CNN nor other mainstream news organizations pursued the story further.

He is best known, however, for being a participant in a fatal duel with Major Thomas Biddle. Pettis County, Missouri, is named in his honor. Early life Spencer Pettis was born in Culpeper County, Virginia, to parents John and Martha (Reynolds) Pettis in 1802. His father was a veteran of the American Revolution, serving with the 1st Regiment, Virginia Line at the Battle of Guilford Court House and elsewhere. Spencer Pettis' exact date of birth and much about his childhood is unknown. Genealogy records indicate he did have at least two sisters, one of whom, Sally, was the mother of American Civil War naval officer Thornton A. Jenkins. Spencer Pettis received at least enough education to study for the law and become a practicing attorney. Pettis moved west in 1821, settling in central Missouri's Boonslick region, opening a law practice in the Howard County seat of Fayette, Missouri. Politics Despite his youth - he did not meet the minimum age of 24 required by the Missouri Constitution - Spencer Pettis was elected to the Missouri General Assembly in 1824 by an overwhelming margin. He would serve less than one full term in the legislature however. In July 1826 Missouri Governor John Miller appointed Pettis the Missouri Secretary of State. It was while in that position he became a friend and protege' of U.S. Senator Thomas Hart Benton and an ardent Jacksonian Democrat.Demuth, I. MacDonald, The History of Pettis County, Missouri (1882), pp. 208-210. Through these new connections Pettis won election in 1828 as Missouri's sole member of the U.S. House of Representatives. At the time most of Missouri's population was centered along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Pettis, seeking every vote possible, had a large number of handbills printed promoting his campaign and distributed them far and wide across the most remote areas of the state. During his brief time in Congress Pettis cast several votes of some historical interest. Among them were \\"aye\\" on a bill to continue work on the Cumberland Road and a resolution urging the U.S. President negotiate with other nations for the abolition of the African slave trade. Pettis would be reelected to a second term in Congress in 1830, but by then the die had been cast in a conflict that would rock Missouri politics and take Pettis' life.Hyde, William and Conard, Howard Louis,Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis Vol. 4, Southern History Co., 1899 An affair of honor What transpired on August 26, 1831, had its roots many months earlier. Missouri's Jacksonian Democrats, led by Senator Thomas Hart Benton, engaged in a number of debates during the 1830 Congressional election season that saw many fiery speeches on issues of banking, currency stability, and western land use. During one of those speeches, Congressman Pettis harshly criticized Nicholas Biddle, President of the Second Bank of the United States. U.S. Army Major Thomas Biddle, a resident of the St. Louis area and brother of Nicholas Biddle, took offense at the remarks. A war of words soon ensued in the St. Louis press in the form of letters to the editor. In one such letter, Biddle called Pettis \\"a dish of skimmed milk\\", to which Pettis responded by questioning Biddle's manhood. Pettis was reelected to U.S. Congress in November 1830, but the feud between the two refused to die. Things escalated dramatically on July 9, 1831, when Thomas Biddle heard that an ill Pettis was resting in a St. Louis hotel. Biddle attacked Pettis in his room, beating him severely with a cowhide whip until other hotel guests intervened. Fearing that he might be attacked again during his recovery, Congressman Pettis had Major Biddle arrested on a peace warrant. At the court proceedings, Pettis attempted to draw a pistol, with the intention of shooting Biddle, but was restrained by friends. At this, Biddle stated that he would promptly accept any challenge that the Congressman cared to issue. After sufficient time to recover from the beating, on August 21, 1831, Congressman Pettis challenged Biddle to a duel, which was promptly accepted. As the challenged party, Biddle was allowed to choose the weapons and distance. Being nearsighted, Major Biddle chose pistols at the unusually close distance of five feet. This meant that each man would take at most one or two steps before turning to fire, with their pistols perhaps even overlapping, depending on arm length. In short, it was suicidal and seen as a ploy by some observers and later historians to make Pettis back down and thus lose the affair of honor without bloodshed. At five p.m. on August 27, 1831, Biddle and Pettis, along with their seconds, Major Benjamin O'Fallon and Captain Martin Thomas respectively, met on Bloody Island, a small sandbar located in the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the Illinois shore. Dueling was illegal in both states, but authorities tended to turn a blind eye to this neutral ground. As large crowds watched from the St. Louis riverfront, Biddle and Pettis obeyed the commands to step, turn, and fire. When the smoke cleared, both men had fallen with mortal wounds. Before being carried off the island, both men were overheard to forgive each other for the altercation. Congressman Spencer Pettis died the next day, while Major Biddle lingered on until August 29. Both men were buried with full honors, eulogized for choosing death before dishonor. The funerals for both men were said to be the largest ever held in St. Louis in the 19th century. Spencer Pettis never married and had no children. William Henry Ashley was elected to finish Pettis's term in the House of Representatives.

Christiansted National Historic Site commemorates urban colonial development of the Virgin Islands. It features 18th and 19th century structures in the heart of Christiansted, the capital of the former Danish West Indies on St. Croix Island. The site consists of six historic structures: Fort Christiansv√¶rn (constructed from 1738 to 1749), the Danish West India and Guinea Company Warehouse (1749), the Church of Our Lord Sabaoth Steeple Building (1753), Customs House (built 1840-1842), the Scale House (1856), and Government House (1747). The Danish West India and Guinea Company held slave auctions within the walled compound of their warehouse until 1803, when the slave trade was outlawed.  History  Beginning in May 1735, Christiansted was developed using a grid system. The Building Code of 1747 dictated street widths, setbacks, zoning, and building material. Masonry structures were the norm by the 1760s, and neoclassical architecture characterized the colonial government buildings. The fort was constructed in 1738 on the remains of an earlier French fortification destroyed by a hurricane. The fort protected commerce from piracy and privateers, plus the local citizens from slave revolts. The first Danish governors were also housed here. The British occupied the colony from 1801 to 1803 and from 1807 to 1815. The fort housed the police headquarters, court offices, courthouse and archives starting in 1878. The soldiers were replaced by 60 gendarmes in 1906 and remained until Transfer Day in 1917. The fort also served as the colony jail. A notable inmate was the mother of Alexander Hamilton, Rachel Faucette. She was wed to her first husband, Johann Michael Lavien, in 1745 at age sixteen. In 1750, she refused to live with Lavien any longer, an offense for which her husband had her jailed under Danish law. She spent several months in a 10 by 13 foot cell with one small window. Soon after being released, she fled to the British West Indies, where she met Hamilton's father. The site was first established on March 4, 1952, as the Virgin Islands National Historic Site, through the initiative of concerned local citizens. Its purpose was to preserve the historic structures and grounds within its boundaries, and to interpret the Danish economy and way of life between 1733 and 1917, including colonial administration, military and naval establishment, international trade (including slave trade), religious diversity, architecture, trades, and crime and punishment. The site was renamed on January 16, 1961. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the historic site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. , the National Park Service planned to celebrate its centennial with an initiative to rehabilitate the main warehouse facility into a slave trade museum, and to restore the complex to its 1833 appearance.

There are three subspecies, all of which winter along temperate-zone sea-coasts and breed on the high-Arctic tundra. The Brent System, a major oilfield, was named after the species. Description Wintering at the Wadden Sea, Germany Feeding in Long Island Sound, Connecticut Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden The brant is a small goose with a short, stubby bill. It measures long, across the wings and weighs . The under-tail is pure white, and the tail black and very short (the shortest of any goose). The species is divided into three subspecies: * Dark-bellied brant B. b. bernicla (Linnaeus, 1758) * Pale- bellied brant B. b. hrota (M√ºller, 1776) (sometimes also known as light- bellied brent goose in Europe, and Atlantic brant in North America) * Black brant B. b. nigricans (Lawrence, 1846) (sometimes also known as the Pacific brant in North America) Some DNA evidence suggests that these forms are genetically distinct; while a split into three separate species has been proposed, it is not widely accepted, with other evidence upholding their maintenance as a single species. The body of the dark-bellied form is fairly uniformly dark grey-brown all over, the flanks and belly not significantly paler than the back. The head and neck are black, with a small white patch on either side of the neck. It breeds on the Arctic coasts of central and western Siberia and winters in western Europe, with over half the population in southern England, the rest between northern Germany and north-western France. The pale-bellied brant appears blackish-brown and light grey in colour. The body is different shades of grey-brown all over, the flanks and belly are significantly paler than the back and present a marked contrast. The head and neck are black, with a small white patch on either side of the neck. It breeds in Franz Josef Land, Svalbard, Greenland and northeastern Canada, wintering in Denmark, northeast England, Ireland and the Atlantic coast of the U.S. from Maine to Georgia, as well as in a small but significant area, le Havre de Regn√©ville, centered on the Sienne Estuary in Manche (Northern France). In Ireland it is recorded in winter from a number areas including Lough Foyle, Strangford Lough, Tralee Bay and Castlemaine Harbour.Ruttledge, R.F. 1966 Ireland's Birds their Distribution and Migration. H.F. & G. Witherby Ltd The black brant appears blackish-brown and white in colour. This form is a very contrastingly black and white bird, with a uniformly dark sooty-brown back, similarly-coloured underparts (with the dark colour extending furthest back of the three forms) and a prominent white flank patch; it also has larger white neck patches, forming a near-complete collar. It breeds in northwestern Canada, Alaska and eastern Siberia, and winters mostly on the west coast of North America from southern Alaska to California, but also some in east Asia, mainly Japan. The Asian populations of the black brant populations had previously been regarded as a separate subspecies orientalis based on purported paler upperparts coloration; however, it is generally now believed that this is not correct. A fourth form (known variously as gray brant, intermediate brant, or grey-bellied brent goose) has been proposed, although no formal subspecies description has been made as yet, for a population of birds breeding in central Arctic Canada (mainly Melville Island), and wintering on Puget Sound on the American west coast around the U.S./Canada border. These birds are intermediate in appearance between black brant and pale-bellied brant, having brown upperparts and grey underparts which give less of a contrast with the white flank patch. Given that this population exhibits mixed characters, it has also been proposed that, rather than being a separate subspecies, it is actually a result of interbreeding between these two forms. Habitat In a defensive position In flight The brant goose was strictly coastal bird in winter, rarely leaving tidal estuaries, where it feeds on eelgrass (Zostera marina) and the seaweed, sea lettuce (Ulva). On the east coast of North America, the inclusion of sea lettuce is a recent change to their diet, brought about by a blight on eelgrass in 1931. This resulted in the near-extirpation of the brant. The few that survived changed their diet to include sea lettuce until the eelgrass eventually began to return. Brants have maintained this diet ever since as a survival strategy. A similar collapse in eelgrass in Ireland in the 1930s also negatively impacted the population. In recent decades, it has started using agricultural land a short distance inland, feeding extensively on grass and winter-sown cereals. It has been suggested that they learnt this behaviour by following other species of geese. Food resource pressure may also be important in forcing this change, as the world population increased over 10-fold to 400,000-500,000 by the mid-1980s, possibly reaching the carrying capacity of the estuaries. In the breeding season, it uses low-lying wet coastal tundra for both breeding and feeding. The nest is bowl-shaped, lined with grass and down, in an elevated location, often near a small pond. The brant goose is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. Etymology Branta is a Latinised form of Old Norse brandg√°s, \\"burnt (black) goose\\", and bernicla is the medieval Latin name for the barnacle. The brant and the similar barnacle goose were previously considered one species, formerly believed to be the same creature as the crustacean. That myth can be dated back to at least the 12th century. Gerald of Wales claimed to have seen these birds hanging down from pieces of timber, William Turner accepted the theory, and John Gerard claimed to have seen the birds emerging from their shells. The legend persisted until the end of the 18th century. In County Kerry, until relatively recently, Catholics could eat this bird on a Friday because it counted as fish.

It can be thought of as the insect equivalent of a mammal's penis, though the comparison is fairly loose given the greater complexity of insect reproduction. The aedeagus is part of the male's abdomen, which is the hindmost of the three major body sections of an insect. The pair of testes of the insect are connected to the aedeagus through the genital ducts. The aedeagus is part of the male insect's phallus, a complex and often species- specific arrangement of more or less sclerotized (hardened) flaps and hooks which also includes in some species the valvae (clasper), which are paired organs which help the male hold on to the female during copulation. During copulation, the aedeagus connects with the ovipore of a female. The aedeagus can be quite pronounced or de minimis. The base of the aedeagus may be the partially sclerotized phallotheca, also called the phallosoma or theca. In some species the phallotheca contains a space, called the endosoma (internal holding pouch), into which the tip end of the aedeagus may be withdrawn (retracted). The vas deferens is sometimes drawn into (folded into) the phallotheca together with a seminal vesicle. The sperm of arthropods is not passed to the female as liquid with free-swimming spermatozoa, but contains capsules called spermatophores in which the actual spermatozoa are enclosed. In addition to the spermatophores, in some species the aedeagus also discharges a spermatophylax, a ball of nutritious secretions to aid the female in producing offspring. In males of most species of Lepidoptera, the aedeagus has a sheath which is supported by an organ called the juxta, which is located between the aforementioned valvae.

When the intent is secrecy protection, such as in dealing with classified information, sanitization attempts to reduce the document's classification level, possibly yielding an unclassified document. When the intent is privacy protection, it is often called data anonymization. Originally, the term sanitization was applied to printed documents; it has since been extended to apply to computer media and the problem of data remanence as well. Redaction in its sanitization sense (as distinguished from its other editing sense) is the blacking out or deletion of text in a document, or the result of such an effort. It is intended to allow the selective disclosure of information in a document while keeping other parts of the document secret. Typically the result is a document that is suitable for publication or for dissemination to others than the intended audience of the original document. For example, when a document is subpoenaed in a court case, information not specifically relevant to the case at hand is often redacted. Government secrecy In the context of government documents, redaction (also called sanitization) generally refers more specifically to the process of removing sensitive or classified information from a document prior to its publication, during declassification. =Secure document redaction techniques= A 1953 US government document that has been redacted prior to release. redacted page from a 2004 lawsuit filed by the ACLU ‚Äî American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft The traditional technique of redacting confidential material from a paper document before its public release involves overwriting portions of text with a wide black pen, followed by photocopying the result‚Äîthe obscured text may be recoverable from the original. Alternatively opaque \\"cover up tape\\" or \\"redaction tape\\", opaque, removable adhesive tape in various widths, may be applied before photocopying. This is a simple process with only minor security risks. For example, if the black pen or tape is not wide enough, careful examination of the resulting photocopy may still reveal partial information about the text, such as the difference between short and tall letters. The exact length of the removed text also remains recognizable, which may help in guessing plausible wordings for shorter redacted sections. Where computer-generated proportional fonts were used, even more information can leak out of the redacted section in the form of the exact position of nearby visible characters. The UK National Archives published a document, Redaction Toolkit, Guidelines for the Editing of Exempt Information from Documents Prior to Release, \\"to provide guidance on the editing of exempt material from information held by public bodies.\\" Secure redacting is a far more complicated problem with computer files. Word processing formats may save a revision history of the edited text that still contains the redacted text. In some file formats, unused portions of memory are saved that may still contain fragments of previous versions of the text. Where text is redacted, in Portable Document Format (PDF) or word processor formats, by overlaying graphical elements (usually black rectangles) over text, the original text remains in the file and can be uncovered by simply deleting the overlaying graphics. Effective redaction of electronic documents requires the removal of all relevant text or image data from the document file. This either requires a very detailed understanding of the internal operation of the document processing software and file formats used, which most computer users lack, or software tools designed for sanitizing electronic documents (see external links below). Redaction usually requires a marking of the redacted area with the reason that the content is being restricted. US government documents being released under the Freedom of Information Act are marked with exemption codes that denote the reason why the content has been withheld. The US National Security Agency (NSA) published a guidance document which provides instructions for redacting PDF files. Printed matter classified document that has been sanitized for public release. This is page 13 of a U.S. National Security Agency report on the USS Liberty incident, which was declassified and released to the public in July 2003. Classified information has been blocked out so that only the unclassified information is visible. Notations with leader lines at top and bottom cite statutory authority for not declassifying certain sections. Click on the image to enlarge. Printed documents which contain classified or sensitive information frequently contain a great deal of information which is less sensitive. There may be a need to release the less sensitive portions to uncleared personnel. The printed document will consequently be sanitized to obscure or remove the sensitive information. Maps have also been redacted for the same reason, with highly sensitive areas covered with a slip of white paper. In some cases, sanitizing a classified document removes enough information to reduce the classification from a higher level to a lower one. For example, raw intelligence reports may contain highly classified information such as the identities of spies, that is removed before the reports are distributed outside the intelligence agency: the initial report may be classified as Top Secret while the sanitized report may be classified as Secret. In other cases, like the NSA report on the USS Liberty incident (right), the report may be sanitized to remove all sensitive data, so that the report may be released to the general public. As is seen in the USS Liberty report, paper documents are generally sanitized by covering the classified and sensitive portions and then photocopying the document, resulting in a sanitized document suitable for distribution. Computer media and files Computer (electronic or digital) documents are more difficult to sanitize. In many cases, when information in an information system is modified or erased, some or all of the data remains in storage. This may be an accident of design, where the underlying storage mechanism (disk, RAM, etc.) still allows information to be read, despite its nominal erasure. The general term for this problem is data remanence. In some contexts (notably the US NSA, DoD, and related organizations), sanitization typically refers to countering the data remanence problem; redaction is used in the sense of this article. However, the retention may be a deliberate feature, in the form of an undo buffer, revision history, \\"trash can\\", backups, or the like. For example, word processing programs like Microsoft Word will sometimes be used to edit out the sensitive information. Unfortunately, these products do not always show the user all of the information stored in a file, so it is possible that a file may still contain sensitive information. In other cases, inexperienced users use ineffective methods which fail to sanitize the document. Metadata removal tools are designed to effectively sanitize documents by removing potentially sensitive information. In May 2005 the US military published a report on the death of Nicola Calipari, an Italian secret agent, at a US military checkpoint in Iraq. The published version of the report was in PDF format, and had been incorrectly redacted using commercial software tools. Shortly thereafter, readers discovered that the blocked-out portions could be retrieved by copying them and pasting into a word processor. Similarly, on May 24, 2006, lawyers for the communications service provider AT&T; filed a legal brief regarding their cooperation with domestic wiretapping by the NSA. Text on pages 12 to 14 of the PDF document were incorrectly redacted, and the covered text could be retrieved using cut and paste. At the end of 2005, the NSA released a report giving recommendations on how to safely sanitize a Microsoft Word document. Issues such as these make it difficult to reliably implement multilevel security systems, in which computer users of differing security clearances may share documents. The Challenge of Multilevel Security gives an example of a sanitization failure caused by unexpected behavior in Microsoft Word's change tracking feature. The two most common mistakes for incorrectly redacting a document are adding an image layer over the sensitive text without removing the underlying text, and setting the background color to match the text color. In both of these cases, the redacted material still exists in the document underneath the visible appearance and is subject to searching and even simple copy and paste extraction. Proper redaction tools and procedures must be used to permanently remove the sensitive information. This is often accomplished in a multi-user workflow where one group of people mark sections of the document as proposals to be redacted, another group verifies the redaction proposals are correct, and a final group operates the redaction tool to permanently remove the proposed items.

It is the winner of the 1985 Newbery Medal award. This story focuses on \\"Aerin Dragon-Killer\\", also known as \\"Aerin Firehair\\", the heroine who is introduced as a legendary character in The Blue Sword. The book narrates Aerin's evolution from the shy, retiring daughter of the King of Damar to the heroic queen who protects her people from the demonic Northerners. Plot summary =Part One= Aerin is the only child of Arlbeth, king of Damar, and his second wife. Aerin inherits her mother's pale skin and fiery red hair, setting her apart from all other Damarians and causing her to be feared and ostracized. Her particular nemesis at court is Galanna, a beautiful but vain young woman, who spread rumors that Aerin's mother was a witch and that Aerin is illegitimate. Galanna taunts Aerin for having failed to develop the Gift, known as kelar, an ability to use magic that all members of the royal family inherit to some degree. During one of their regular fights, Galanna convinces Aerin to eat the leaves of the surka plant, which is poisonous to all those not of royal blood. While eating the surka plant does not kill Aerin, it makes her extremely ill. During her recovery, Aerin stumbles upon a book about the history of Damar and the enormous dragons of old that used to terrorize it, of which only much smaller relatives still exist. Seeking privacy in the pasture of her father's now- injured war horse, Talat, Aerin reads through the book while forging a friendship with the stubborn and proud horse. At the back of the book she finds a recipe for kenet, an ointment meant to protect the wearer from the effects of fire. While experimenting with the ointment, she also trains herself on mounted combat with Talat. Eventually, she sneaks off to slay a small dragon that has been terrorizing a village. Her success earns her some minor notoriety and requests for assistance from other villages. In the meantime, trouble comes from the north, in the form of one of the western barons, Nyrlol, who threatens civil war. =Part Two= Arlbeth fears that the Hero's Crown, an item of power, has finally fallen into the hands of the demonic Northerners, and that Nyrlol's madness is a symptom of their growing power. He is forced to ride west with many of his court, including Tor (his male heir and Aerin's only friend), to deal with Nyrlol, but denies Aerin's request to join him. However, just as Arlbeth prepares to ride north, a messenger arrives bearing news that the last of great dragons, Maur, has reappeared and is terrorizing Damar. Arlbeth has no choice but to deal with Nyrlol first. But Aerin, having been left behind, decides to fight Maur on her own. After a tremendous battle Aerin barely manages to defeat Maur, claiming as her trophy a red stone left behind when his body burns itself to ashes. Aerin is severely injured but manages to drag herself onto Talat, who carries her home. Maur's skull is brought to the castle as a trophy but its presence seems to taunt Aerin and her health does not improve. In her declining state, Aerin dreams of a blond man by a lake who beckons her to come to him so that he may help her. Aerin leaves Tor a note and rides off on Talat to find this man, Luthe. Luthe, a sorcerer, heals Aerin by placing her in the Lake of Dreams, which causes her to become \\"not-quite-mortal\\". Luthe teaches her some magic and Aerin learns that it is the kelar that gives the royal family their magical abilities. Luthe then reveals that Aerin's mother and uncle, Agsded, along with Luthe, were students of a master mage. Agsded was the best student but used his abilities for evil. A prophecy foretold that one of Agsded's own blood would defeat him; in fear, Aerin's mother fled to the south to have a child (Aerin) with Arlbeth. When Aerin is fully recovered, Luthe sends her north with the dragon's red bloodstone and Gonturan, The Blue Sword, to challenge Agsded. As she travels, Aerin is joined by armies of foltsza (large mountain cats) and yerigs (large wild dogs). After an extensive magical battle in which Agsded is eventually defeated and the Hero's Crown is recovered, Aerin is rescued by Luthe, who escorts Aerin back as far as his lake on her way home. They become romantically involved; Aerin leaves him but promises to return one day, as they are both immortal. She returns to find the kingdom losing a battle with the Northern demons. Using Gonturan and her army of foltsza and yerigs, and giving the Hero's Crown to Tor, she helps defeat the Northerners, but at the cost of many lives, including Arlbeth's. Aerin, with Tor's help, finally rids the kingdom of Maur's evil skull, but in the process the skull turns Damar into a desert. Aerin marries Tor, whom she truly loves in her own way, and they help rebuild the kingdom together as its rulers. Characters =Aerin= The \\"Sol,\\" or the King's closest female heir, she is King Arlbeth's daughter. Aerin is shunned because of her foreign looks and the rumor that her mother was a witch who ensnared her father so she could bear an heir with noble blood. Despite having virtually no friends and being distant from her father, Aerin gradually earns acceptance with her dragon- slaying, skill with horses, and knowledge of how to make the ointment kenet, which makes the wearer fireproof. This character appears in brief, ghostly form in The Blue Sword. =Luthe= An immortal sorcerer who teaches Aerin much about her Gift and her family as he heals her from her encounter with the dragon Maur. He dips her in the Lake of Dreams, making her \\"not-quite-mortal,\\" and falls in love with her. This character also appears in The Blue Sword. = Maur = An evil dragon terrorizing Damar. =Tor= The \\"sola\\", or male heir to the throne, he is Aerin's only friend and loves her dearly. =Galanna= Beautiful, small, and vindictive, she and her lover Perlith are Aerin's chief enemies at court. = Agsded = An evil wizard who is also Aerin's uncle.

They were intended for Continental boat trains between London (Victoria) and Dover harbour, but were also later used for express passenger work to the South-West of England. Sixteen of them were constructed, representing the most powerful (although not the most successful) Southern 4-6-0 design. They were all named after famous admirals. The class continued to operate with British Railways until withdrawn during 1961 and 1962. Only one example of the class ‚Äì the first engine, Lord Nelson itself ‚Äì has been saved from scrapping. This has been seen running on mainline tours and preserved railways throughout Britain.  Background  Although the improved ‚ÄùKing Arthur‚Äù class 4-6-0 locomotives were capable of the heaviest express passenger work between London and South- West England, there was a growth in demand for Continental traffic travelling via Dover and Folkestone. By the mid-1920s the Southern Railway Traffic Department wished to begin operating express trains on these routes during peak periods. These would require a more powerful locomotive, able to pull heavier loads at sustained speeds of , so as not to impede the congested electrified lines around London. However, any enlargement of the existing 2-cylinder design was not possible due to weight restrictions imposed by the railway‚Äôs Civil Engineer. After examining the practice of other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between the need for additional power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit. There were two unusual features of the design: the first of which was the setting of the crank axles at 135¬∞, rather than the standard 90¬∞ of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.  Construction history  The prototype E850 named Lord Nelson was ordered from Eastleigh railway works in June 1925 but production proceeded slowly, at Maunsell‚Äôs insistence, to ensure that the weight was kept to a minimum at every stage, so the locomotive did not appear until August 1926. It was tested on a variety of duties over the next year, with sufficiently encouraging results for an initial order for ten more locomotives for delivery between May 1928 and April 1929 to be placed. These were originally scheduled to be allocated to Battersea depot and fitted with 4,000 gallon 6-wheeled tenders suitable for the Continental ports. However, during construction, it was decided to equip half of the class with 5,000 gallon 8-wheeled tenders necessary for the longer West of England routes and to allocate them to Nine Elms depot. A further batch of ten locomotives was ordered in 1928, before the previous batch had been delivered, but when it became apparent that the Stock Market Crash of 1929 would be likely to reduce the demand for Continental travel, this second order was reduced to five. = Naming the locomotives = The locomotives were all named after famous Royal Navy admirals, with the doyen of the class being named Lord Nelson. As a result, the rest of the locomotives belonged to the Lord Nelson (LN) class. =Modifications= The performance of the new locomotives was mixed, depending upon the experience of the crew and the circumstances under which they were operating. At times it was no better than their smaller predecessors. Maunsell therefore undertook a number of experiments to try to improve the performance of the new locomotives. No. E859 was fitted with smaller driving wheels to see if this would improve performance over the heavily graded London-Dover line, but the difference was marginal. No. E860 was fitted with a longer, heavier boiler but once again with little improvement. The whole class however benefitted from the fitting of smoke deflectors during the late 1920s. Maunsell was aware of the reputation for poor steaming enjoyed by the class and attempted to address it by the fitting of twin Kylchap blastpipes to No. 860 in 1934. However, the problem was ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lema√Ætre multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.  Operational details  30860 Lord Hawke at Basingstoke in 1959. :For location details and current status of the preserved locomotive, see: List of Lord Nelson class locomotives For a period after its introduction to the Southern Railway network, the Lord Nelson class held the title of \\"most powerful locomotive in Britain\\" ‚Äì a claim based on its tractive effort. The advanced design of the locomotive led to the GWR introducing the GWR 6000 Class in order to regain the title lost by their GWR Castle class locomotives when the Lord Nelsons were constructed. The planned 500-ton trains never materialised, but the class was regularly used on 460 ton trains such as the Golden Arrow. After the Second World War they were also frequently used on heavily laden Boat Trains between London Waterloo station and Southampton docks. The Lord Nelsons were notoriously difficult for inexperienced crews to fire properly, due to their long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This was due to the relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design. For information on influence. Accidents and incidents *One member of the Lord Nelson class was involved in what could have been a major accident on 23 January 1930. This entailed the leading driving wheels jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a set of points.Anderson, Introduction *No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. A bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. *No. 852 Sir Walter Raleigh received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. *No. 854 Howard of Effingham suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water on 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. *No. 851 Sir Francis Drake was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet on 27 December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. *On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed. *No. 30854 Howard of Effingham was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at , Hampshire on 20 July 1952. Withdrawal  The class was gradually superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by growing numbers of Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to deputise for failures.Townroe, section: \\"Lord Nelson class\\" The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962. Livery and numbering = Southern Railway = The Lord Nelson class was initially painted in Maunsell lined olive green, which later changed to a lighter shade in the mid-1930s. From 1938, some of the locomotives were painted in a semi-matt Malachite Green finish when Bulleid replaced Maunsell as CME of the Southern. During the war years, the locomotives were painted in wartime black livery, though retained the word \\"Southern\\" in yellow on the tender. After the war, the livery was reverted to the Southern Railway Malachite Green standard with \\"Sunshine Yellow\\" lining on the boiler rings. Numbers allocated to the locomotives were a variation of LSWR practice and, being constructed at Eastleigh, were given the prefix \\"E\\" before the number to distinguish from the locomotives of other pre-grouping railway companies that also carried the same number. In the case of the Lord Nelson class the numbering ranged from E850 to E865. This was eventually superseded by numbers without the \\"E\\" prefix, becoming 850 to 865 from 1931. For information on the \\"E\\" numbering system. =Post-1948 (nationalisation)= The initial livery applied following the nationalisation of the railways in 1948 was modified Southern malachite green and sunshine yellow with \\"British Railways\\" on the tender, and the Southern numbering system was temporarily retained with an \\"S\\" prefix (such as S850) until superseded by the British Railways numbering system. The locomotives then carried British Railways Brunswick green livery with orange and black lining. By this stage the locomotives were renumbered under standard British Railways procedure, from 30850 to 30865.Ian Allan ABC, 1958-59  Preservation  850 Lord Nelson at Minehead, WSR in 2006 The only survivor, first-of-class (30)850 Lord Nelson, has been preserved as part of the National Railway Collection, and has run on the national rail network.

He received several medals for his service as a navigator during the Second World War. From 1967 to 1970 he served as Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff. Early life and career Ian Leslie Trower Hogg, the son of an Indian Army colonel, was born in Camberley on 30 May 1911.Obituary: Sir Ian Hogg Guardian, 28 March 2003 His mother died at Dehra Dun two months after his birth. He was educated at Cheltenham College and joined the Navy in 1929 as a Special Entry ‚Äî or ex-public school ‚Äî cadet, earning a first-class certificate on graduation from the training ship . He subsequently served in the battleships and and the cruiser HMS Effingham on the East Indies Station. His aptitude for navigation was shown early when a lieutenant in the destroyer in the Mediterranean in 1934, and the dispatch vessel in the Persian Gulf. His confidential reports during this period describe a capable leader, with a markedly beneficial influence over junior officers and the ship‚Äôs company. Qualifying as a specialist navigator in 1937, he was appointed to the cruiser . His war started in the obsolete light cruiser on the arduous northern blockade patrol that deprived Germany of imports, and it continued briefly in the cruiser where his ‚Äúsomewhat casual manner‚Äù was perceptively diagnosed as \\"liable to mislead\\". His war career showed that he was clearly able to differentiate the important from the unimportant and to ‚Äúbear an even strain‚Äù under testing circumstances. Second World War Hogg was awarded the first of his two Distinguished Service Crosses (DSC) for his efficiency and coolness as a navigator under the trying circumstances of the evacuation of Crete in May and June 1941. The Germans had intended to take Crete with combined airborne and seaborne attacks. Although the Royal Navy was able virtually to annihilate the seaborne component, which carried much equipment in local ca√Øques, the German paratroops‚Äîthough at great loss to themselves‚Äîforced the under-equipped British forces, many of whom were still in shock after being driven out of Greece, into another evacuation. Air attacks by an almost unopposed and expert Fliegerkorps VIII around Crete cost the British three cruisers and six destroyers sunk, with an aircraft carrier, two battleships, five cruisers and seven destroyers badly damaged, bringing the Mediterranean Fleet almost to breaking point. The Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, was adamant that while ships were replaceable, the reputation of the Royal Navy was not, and that the evacuation of soldiers should continue to the limit. In the event 18,000 troops were rescued. As the flotilla operations and navigating officer to Captain Stephen Arliss in the Royal Australian Navy destroyer Napier, Hogg was responsible on 28‚Äì29 May for organising hazardous feats of navigation on an unlit and badly charted coast near Sfakia in southwest Crete for his ship and the destroyers HMS Nizam, HMS Kelvin and HMS Kandahar. Only two motorboats and four unpowered whalers were available to embark 700 men and, at the same time, land 15,000 badly needed rations for those troops still fighting onshore. The need to make best use of available darkness required the anchorage for this operation to be perilously close inshore. On 30 May, reduced to only two ships through damage and defects but using abandoned landing craft to supplement these, Napier and Nizam saved more than 1,400 troops. Hogg received praise for his cool, calm and cheerful demeanour and his very good advice when the force came under intensive air attack on 31 May, during which Napier was damaged in the engine room by a near miss. Hogg stayed with the Napier as the senior staff officer to Captain Arliss, who became the commodore in command of Admiral Somerville's Eastern Fleet destroyers, based in Ceylon, until early 1944. As the navigating and signals officer of the cruiser HMS Mauritius in August 1944, Hogg was awarded a Bar to his DSC for his outstanding zeal during prolonged and violent night actions against escorted enemy convoys close inshore near La Rochelle and the Ile d'Yeu. His captain remarked that Hogg was \\"cool, calm and collected and afforded advice that enabled us to take risks which with a less resolute and skilful officer would not have been justified\\". Hogg was known as a good- looking man. It is recorded that during the war when Mauritius was refitting in Liverpool and a drink was difficult to come by, his companions would always \\"put Ian into bat first with the barmaid\\"‚Äîwith invariably satisfactory results. In 1945 he married Mary Marsden within three months of having met her in Liverpool on a Monday and becoming engaged on the Saturday. Post-war service After completing the staff course Hogg was appointed to the staff of the C-in-C Home Fleet from September 1945, the task of fleet navigator carrying the ancient title of Master of the Fleet. He was promoted to commander in 1947 and sent to Washington D.C. as staff officer (plans) in the British Joint Services Mission until 1949. Command of the destroyer followed, his ship being noted for her good spirit and efficient gunnery. He was then selected as staff officer (plans) and fleet navigating officer in the Mediterranean where Admiral the Earl Mountbatten of Burma appointed him as special assistant to the newly created Chief of NATO‚Äôs Allied Staff. On his promotion to captain, Mountbatten wrote of him: 'He was doing a job originally intended for captain‚Äôs rank and doing it brilliantly'. After another staff tour in Washington and at the Admiralty, Hogg was appointed to Cyprus as the senior naval officer. Flag-rank assignments Hogg was promoted to rear- admiral in 1962, and was Flag Officer, Medway and Admiral Superintendent Chatham Dockyard. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1964. As a vice admiral he was the Defence Services Secretary from 1966 to 1967, managing the relationship between the Ministry of Defence and the Royal Family and also maintaining the balance of appointments of senior officers to tri-service \\"defence department\\" posts‚Äîthose posts which are rotated between the services. His final tour was as Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff during a difficult period of retrenchment in the defence sector. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and retired in 1970. Retirement and last years From 1971 until 1974 Hogg was the Comptroller of the Royal Society of St George, an institution founded in 1894 with the object of promoting the English way of life. He died on 2 March 2003, aged 91.

The nats (; MLCTS: nat; ) are spirits worshipped in Myanmar and neighboring countries in conjunction with Buddhism. They are divided between the 37 Great Nats and all the rest (i.e., spirits of trees, water, etc.). Almost all of the 37 Great Nats were human beings who met violent deaths (, ). They may thus also be called nat sein (; ). The word 'sein', while meaning 'green', is being used to mean 'raw' in this context. There are however two types of nats in Burmese Buddhist belief. Nat spirits are termed lower nats or auk nats (), whether named or unnamed, whereas ahtet nats () or higher nat dewas inhabit the six heavens. Much like sainthood, nats can be designated for a variety of reasons, including those only known in certain regions in Burma. Nat worship is less common in urban areas than in rural areas, and is practised among ethnic minorities of Myanmar as well as in the mainstream Bamar society. It is however among the Theravada Buddhist Bamar that the most highly developed form of ceremony and ritual is seen. Every Burmese village has a nat sin () which essentially serves as a shrine to the village guardian nat called the ywa saung nat (). An offertory coconut () is often hung on the main southeast post () in the house, wearing a gaung baung (headdress) and surrounded by perfume, as an offering to the Min Mahagiri (Lord of the Great Mountain), also known as the ein dwin () or ein saung () (house guardian) nat. One may inherit a certain member or in some instances two of the 37 Nats as mi hsaing hpa hsaing (; ) from one or both parents' side to worship depending on where their families originally come from. One also has a personal guardian spirit called ko saung nat (). Nat worship and Buddhism A nat kadaw dressed as U Min Gyaw at a nat pw√® in Mingun, August 1989 Academic opinions vary as to whether Burmese Buddhism and Burmese spirit worship are two separate entities, or merged into a single religion. Some Burmese might say spirit worship is superstition and downplay its role in society. The formalizing of the official 37 Nats by King Anawrahta (1044‚Äì1077) of Bagan, has been interpreted as Burmanisation and establishment of Bamar supremacy in the Irrawaddy valley after the unification of the country and founding of the First Burmese Empire. Worship of nats predates Buddhism in Burma. With the arrival of Buddhism, however, the nats were merged, syncretistically, with Buddhism. Nat worship and ecology Mount Popa from Kyaukpadaung road, the smaller precipice Taung Kalat with its nat shrines atop to left of picture The widespread traditional belief among rural folks that there are forest guardian spirits called taw saung nats () and mountain guardian spirits called taung saung nats () appears to act as a deterrent against environmental destruction up to a point. Indiscriminate felling particularly of large trees is generally eschewed owing to the belief that they are dwellings of tree spirits called yokkazo () and that such an act would bring the wrath of the nat upon the perpetrator. Popular nat festivals Mount Popa and Taung Kalat to left of picture seen from a distance across a dry riverbed Offerings of alcohol and liquor to Min Kyawzwa at a nat pwe in Amarapura The most important nat pilgrimage site in Burma is Mount Popa, an extinct volcano with numerous temples and relic sites atop a mountain 1300 metres tall located near Bagan in central Burma. The annual festival is held on the full moon of the month of Natdaw (December) of the Burmese calendar. Taungbyone, north of Mandalay in Madaya Township, is another major site with the festival held each year starting on the eleventh waxing day and including the full moon in the month Wagaung (August). Yadanagu at Amarapura, held a week later in honour of Popa Medaw (\\"Mother of Popa\\"), who was the mother of the Taungbyone Min Nyinaung (\\"Brother Lords\\"), is also a popular nat festival. Nats have human characteristics, wants, and needs. They are flawed, having desires considered derogatory and immoral in mainstream Buddhism. During a nat pw√®, which is a festival during which nats are propitiated, nat kadaws ( \\"lord-consort\\", i.e. \\"medium, shaman\\") dance and embody the nat's spirit in a trance. Historically, the nat kadaw profession was hereditary and passed from mother to daughter. Until the 1980s, few nat gadaws were male. Since the 1980s, persons identified by outsiders as trans women or gay male transvestites have increasingly performed these roles. Music, often accompanied by a hsaing waing (\\"orchestra\\"), adds much to the mood of the nat pw√®, and many are entranced. People come from far to take part in the festivities in various nat shrines called nat kun or nat naan, get drunk on palm wine and dance wildly in fits of ecstasy to the wild beat of the Hsaing waing music, possessed by the nats. Whereas nat pw√®s are annual events celebrating a particular member of the 37 Nats regarded as the tutelary spirit in a local region within a local community, with familial custodians of the place and tradition and with royal sponsorship in ancient times, hence evocative of royal rituals, there are also nat kannah pw√®s where individuals would have a pavilion set up in a neighbourhood and the ritual is generally linked to the entire pantheon of nats. The nat kadaws as an independent profession made their appearance in the latter half of the 19th century as spirit mediums, and nat kannahs are more of an urban phenomenon which evolved to satisfy the need of people who had migrated from the countryside to towns and cities but who wished to carry on their traditions or yo-ya of supplicating the mi hsaing hpa hsaing tutelary spirit of their native place. List of official nats Traditional offerings of bananas and coconut at a nat shrine Min Gyi and Min Lay at Mount Popa King Anawrahta of Bagan (1044‚Äì1077) designated an official pantheon of 37 nats after he had failed to enforce a ban on nat worship. His stratagem of incorporation eventually succeeded by bringing nats to Shwezigon Pagoda portrayed worshipping Gautama Buddha and by enlisting ≈öakra , a Buddhist protective deity, to head the pantheon above the Mahagiri nats as Thagyamin. Seven out of the 37 Nats appear to be directly associated with the life and times of Anawrahta. The official pantheon is made up predominantly of those from the royal houses of Burmese history, but also contains nats of Thai (Yun Bayin) and Shan (Maung Po Tu) descent; illustrations of them show them in Burmese royal dress.

Background and education Cholmondeley was the son of George Cholmondeley, Viscount Malpas, and Hester Edwardes. George Cholmondeley, 3rd Earl of Cholmondeley, was his grandfather. He was a direct descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. He was educated at Eton. In January 1776, Cholmondeley began an affair with the noted beauty Grace Dalrymple Elliot, allegedly taking her up during a Pantheon masquerade ball. Grace was legally separated from her husband, Dr. John Eliot, who was to divorce her several months later. This liaison lasted for three years. Career In 1770 he succeeded his grandfather as fourth Earl of Cholmondeley and entered the House of Lords. In April 1783, Cholmondeley was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard in the government of the Duke of Portland, a post he held until December the same year. He remained out of office for the next 29 years, but in 1812 he was made Lord Steward of the Household in Spencer Perceval's Tory administration. He continued in the post after Lord Liverpool became Prime Minister after Perceval's assassination in May 1812, holding it until 1821. In 1815, Cholmondeley was created Earl of Rocksavage, in the County of Chester, and Marquess of Cholmondeley. He was further honoured when he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order (Hanoverian Order) in 1819 and a Knight of the Garter in 1822. Apart from his political career, he was also Lord-Lieutenant of Cheshire from 1770 to 1783 and Vice-Admiral of Cheshire from 1770 to 1827. Cholmondeley Sound, in southeast Alaska, was named for him in 1793 by George Vancouver. Personal life William Henry Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Marquess of Cholmondeley (1805), by Charles Turner. Lord Cholmondeley married Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, on 25 April 1791. Through this marriage the ancient hereditary office of Lord Great Chamberlain came into the Cholmondeley family.

Cholmondeley Castle He inherited Houghton Hall in Norfolk from his great-uncle Horace Walpole in 1797 but preferred to live at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire, which had been rebuilt in 1801-04 to his design. He was friends with the disreputable courtesans Gertrude Mahon, Grace Elliott and Kitty Frederick. According to the betting book for Brooks's, a London gentlemen's club, Cholmondeley once wagered two guineas to Lord Derby, to receive 500 guineas upon having sexual intercourse with a woman \\"in a balloon one thousand yards from the Earth.\\" It is unknown whether the bet was ever finalised.L.

The Siraya settled flat coastal plains in the southwest part of the island of Taiwan and corresponding sections of the east coast; the area is identified today with Tainan City and Taitung County. At least four communities make up the group: Mattauw, Soelangh, Baccloangh, and Sinckan. The first four communities correspond to the modern-day districts of Madou, Jiali, Shanhua, and Sinshih, respectively. The Siraya are Plains indigenous peoples (Pingpu) ‚Äî that is, occupants of flat coastal regions rather than mountain areas. Like other indigenous peoples of Taiwan they are ethnically and linguistically Austronesian. The name \\"Taiwan\\" (historically Taiouwang, and other variants) originated from the Siraya language. The Austronesian language family from which Sirayan belongs includes some of the most spoken languages in the western Pacific particularly Bahasa Indonesia, Javanese, Tagalog (or standardized as Filipino), and Malay. Taivoan and Makatao used to be considered two communities of the Siraya but are now classified as independent indigenous peoples, based on the latest linguistic discoveries, cultural features, and the indigenous people's self-identification. Modern history After the port in the Siraya area of Taiwan was annexed in 1683 by Qing Dynasty China, a process of gradual acculturation led to the Siraya language falling out of use. Its last recorded regular use was in 1908, after Taiwan was under Japanese rule. The mother tongue of most Siraya families became Hokkien Chinese, with Japanese and Mandarin Chinese learned in schools as the government-mandated lingua franca. The Siraya maintained many aspects of their culture despite this. A number of families in the Tso-chen, Kou-pei and Chiou- chen-lin of Sinhua Township in particular still identify themselves as Siraya. The family name Wan (Ëê¨), often encountered in the region, is a Chinese transliteration of Talavan, a common Siraya surname. A Siraya Culture Association (Âè∞ÂçóÁ∏£Âπ≥ÂüîÊóèË•øÊãâÈõÖÊñáÂåñÂçîÊúÉ) was established in 1999. In 2002 the reconstructed Siraya language (see below) began to be taught in schools and used in new literature. In 2005 the Tainan County (now part of Tainan City) government established a Siraya Aboriginal Affairs Committee (Âè∞ÂçóÁ∏£Ë•øÊãâÈõÖÂéü‰ΩèÊ∞ëÊóè‰∫ãÂãôÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ) and subsidised a glossary, released in 2008, containing entries for over 4,000 Sirayan words. Efforts have been under way by the Siraya and related plains aboriginal peoples to gain official recognition from Taiwan's national government. In 2010 the Siraya enlisted the aid of the United Nations. Siraya and Taiwan government representatives have noted a flaw in the language of the law: the Chinese term employed for indigenous peoples literally means \\"mountain people.\\" A literal reading of the law excludes coastal groups from recognition automatically. Government officials have proposed changing the law to ensure accuracy and inclusion of all indigenous groups. Culture Traditionally the Siraya lived in villages, which were in constant conflict with one another. Women handled agriculture and religion, while men handled hunting, warfare and decision-making. Married couples did not live together, with the wife living with her parents and the husband living in the men's quarters; if they wanted to see one another, the husband would have to visit in secret. The Siraya were unusual in that most women did not have children until their mid-thirties and if a woman became pregnant before this, an abortion would usually be performed by the village shaman, with most women having multiple abortions during their lifetime. This was because the Siraya held a belief that childbirth and child rearing had an adverse effect on success in warfare, thus childbirth was postponed until the husband retired from being a warrior (generally around age forty), with his wife being a few years younger than him and still having a few years of child-bearing left.Adelaar, Alexander. \\"The Austronesian languages of Taiwan, with special reference to Siraya.\\" Online at https://www.soas.ac.uk/taiwanstudies/eats/eats2005/file24063.pdf (viewed 18 June 2019) (2005). Language According to Taiwan Journal, Taiwan's Academia Sinica historians and linguistics announced, on 14 February 2006, that their team of researchers have deciphered up to 80% of the 187 so-called Sinckan Manuscripts (or Sinkang Manuscripts), a set of documents from 17th and 18th centuries written in the language spoken by the Siraya people using a system of romanization introduced by the Dutch in the 17th century. In order to convert the Siraya to Christianity, Dutch missionaries studied the Sirayan language, devised a romanized script in which to record it, taught the Siraya people how to use it, and began translating the New Testament into the Sirayan language. Copies of the Dutch missionaries' translation of the Book of Matthew into Sirayan have survived, and several of the manuscripts are bilingual, with side-by-side Sirayan and Chinese versions of the contents.Excerpted from Taiwan Journal See also *Daniel Gravius - Siraya language scholar References Further reading * * External links *Siraya Culture Association (Âè∞ÂçóÁ∏£Âπ≥ÂüîÊóèË•øÊãâÈõÖÊñáÂåñÂçîÊúÉ) (Chinese) *Tainan Cultural Affairs Department (Âè∞ÂçóÁ∏£ÊîøÂ∫úÊñáÂåñÂ±Ä) (Chinese) *Siraya National Scenic Area (Ë•øÊãâÈõÖÂúãÂÆ∂È¢®ÊôØÂçÄ).

Musical career Berner, in his youth, studied the piano. At a party, somebody asked him why he did not play the accordion. As a result, he began learning how to play the accordion. Following several years fronting the punk band Terror of Tiny Town (its name borrowed from the 1938 film), Berner released his first solo EP, Light Enough to Travel (2000) on the Sudden Death Records label. Light Enough to Travel contained some of the songs he wrote while part of The Terror of Tiny Town. The Vancouver band The Be Good Tanyas covered the title track, and had some chart success with their version in England, which helped to kickstart Berner's career. In 2000, Berner was deported to Norway, where he discovered the Norwegian band Kaizers Orchestra, for whom he would later become a support act. His first full-length album, We Shall Not Flag or Fail, We Shall Go On to the End (2003) featured the track \\"Volcano God\\", which has been covered by Finnish-German singer/songwriter M√§kkel√§ and Canadian singer/songwriter Wax Mannequin. In the years between We Shall Not Flag or Fail, We Shall Go On to the End and 2005, Berner travelled to Romania, to study the traditional musical style klezmer, from the many talented masters in Romania. In Romania, he suffered a severe gastrointestinal infection and was rushed to a Romanian hospital, which inspired him to write \\"Song Written in a Romanian Hospital\\". After his return, Berner released his second studio album, Whiskey Rabbi (2005) on Black Hen Music, with the help of Diona Davies of Po' Girl, on the violin, and Wayne Adams of Zolty Cracker, percussion. They would later join him occasionally on tour. Whiskey Rabbi is the first of a trilogy of klezmer-themed records. Berner released a humorous instructional booklet called How to be an Accordion Player in 2006. In 2007, Berner released The Wedding Dance of the Widow Bride, a concept album with the theme of marriage, and second in his planned trilogy of klezmer records. He also collaborated with the Norwegian band \\"Girl from Saskatoon\\" on their 2007 album. In 2008, he released \\"Official Theme Song for the 2010 Vancouver / Whistler Olympic Games (The Dead Children Were Worth It!)\\", a satirical song he promoted as the official theme song for the 2010 Winter Olympics, as an mp3 on February 19, 2008. The song asserts that, in order to help pay for the games, the government of British Columbia closed a provincial coroner's office which investigated the deaths of children. He later attracted controversy at the Winnipeg Folk Festival in July when he opened his set with a performance of \\"The Dead Children Were Worth It!\\", followed by a joke which linked the festival's corporate sponsor, Volkswagen, to Nazi Germany. In 2008 he released Klezmer Mongrels, the third album in his klezmer trilogy. Later in the year, Berner and colleague Bob Wiseman were given the Key to the City of Bruno, Saskatchewan. Berner signed with Vancouver-based Mint Records in 2010 and recorded Victory Party with producer Socalled. Released March 8, 2011, Victory Party featured backing musicians who specialized in authentic klezmer music. While the majority of modern klezmer is filtered through different forms of Western music, Berner's intention was to find a more traditional sound. He stated at the time, \\"We're all trying to put out a vision of Jewish culture that's the opposite of the conservative, knee-jerk pro-Israel, judgmental b---s--- that's emerged in recent decades.\\" Following a four-year gap, Berner's next original album, We Are Going To Bremen To Be Musicians, became one of the first releases on Rae Spoon's Coax Records in 2015. The album title is a reference to the old German folk tale about elderly farm animals threatened with death, who run away from their masters in the hope of achieving freedom by becoming Town Musicians. The story's theme of irrational hope and optimism in the face of horror was echoed in most of the songs on the album. ‚ÄúI would describe the record as a compendium of strategies against despair,‚Äù Berner stated. Berner's next album, Canadiana Grotesquica, arrived in 2017 on Coax Records, preceded by the single \\"Hustle Advisory (Canada 150 Remix by Socalled).\\" The songs were a return to a more traditional alt-country style, guided by producer/guitarist Paul Rigby. Significant contributions were also made by Frazey Ford and Diona Davies. The album contains the song \\"Gino Odjick,\\" a tribute to the Vancouver Canucks fan favourite, while other songs namecheck Terry Fox, Corb Lund and Country Dick Montana. In February 2019, Berner released a video for the Canadiana Grotesquica track \\"Super Subtle Folk Song\\" in response to the National Energy Board's second recommendation to approve the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.  Personal life  Berner is the stepfather of actress Genevieve Buechner, and father of Margot Berner and Joseph Zeidler-Berner. He is also close friends with American ukulele player Carmaig de Forest, and covers his compositions regularly on tour, and recorded his song \\"In the Year 2020\\" on his We Shall Not Flag or Fail, We Shall Go On to the End album. In 2008, he began covering songwriter Kris Demeanor instead of de Forest, and Demeanor's song \\"One Shoe\\" appears on the Klezmer Mongrels album. Additionally, Berner also often collaborates with fellow Canadian Carolyn Mark, and recorded a duet with her, for her Just Married: An Album of Duets album in 2005. Berner is Jewish, which is reflected in his klezmer song \\"Lucky God Damn Jew\\". Politics Between 1988 and 2001, Berner was active in the Green Party of British Columbia and was a member of former leader Stuart Parker's inner circle. He ran as a candidate at the federal and provincial levels in the general elections of 1991, 1993, 1996 and 1997. His most high-profile campaign, however, was as a candidate for the satirical Rhinoceros Party of Canada in the 2001 provincial general election against future premier Gordon Campbell. In recent years, Berner has expressed intense environmental concerns, and has thrown his support behind the newly-launched BC Ecosocialist Party.

Along with John Marshall and Robert Gardner, Asch played an important role in the development of visual anthropology. He is particularly known for his film The Ax Fight and his role with the USC Center for Visual Anthropology. Background Asch was born in Southampton, New York and attended The Putney School. He studied at Columbia University, where he received his B.S. in anthropology in 1959. While at Columbia, he served as a teaching assistant for Margaret Mead, who encouraged his work in visual anthropology. From 1950-1951, he served apprenticeships with Minor White, Edward Weston and Ansel Adams through the San Francisco Art Institute (formerly known as the California School of Fine Arts). He received his M.A. in African Studies from Boston University (with an anthropology concentration at Harvard University) in 1964. Career Asch was known for his work as an ethnographic filmmaker on the Yanomami in conjunction with Napoleon Chagnon. He also worked in Indonesia with anthropologists Linda Connor, James J. Fox and E. Douglas Lewis. In 1968, Asch and John Marshall co- founded Documentary Educational Resources (DER), a non-profit organization whose mission is to support, produce, and distribute ethnographic, non- fiction, and documentary films. Asch's film work continues to be distributed through DER. Asch taught at New York University, Brandeis University, and Harvard University, and was a Research Fellow at the Australian National University prior to joining the University of Southern California (USC) in 1982. He became the Director of the Center for Visual Anthropology after the death of founder Barbara Myerhoff. During his period at USC, he was involved with the Margaret Mead Film Festival. Asch acted as Director of the Center for Visual Anthropology up until his death from cancer on October 3, 1994. The Spring 1995 issue of Visual Anthropology Review (Vol. 11, No.1) was dedicated to Asch.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1922, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. Grierson was a member of the Liberal Party. Grierson was born in Brantford, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of George Grierson and Margaret Edmundson, and was educated in that city and in Winnipeg. Grierson received a teaching certificate and served as principal of the Minnedosa public school from 1887 to 1890 and from 1892 to 1902. In 1892, he married Christina Matheson. He also worked as a financial agent. Grierson served as a town councillor in Minnedosa and was mayor of the city from 1914 to 1915. He ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1911 federal election as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in Marquette, but lost to Conservative William James Roche, 3,409 votes to 3,283. Grierson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Conservative candidate William B. Waddell in Minnedosa by 209 votes. This election saw Premier Rodmond Roblin's Conservatives elected to a fifth term in office, and Grierson sat with his party on the opposition benches. He served as Liberal whip in the assembly. Early in 1915, the Conservatives were forced to resign from office in the wake of a serious corruption scandal. The Liberals won a landslide majority government in the election which followed, with Grierson defeating Conservative candidate James Muir by 219 votes. On November 10, 1917, Grierson was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Public Works. The Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1920 provincial election, amid the rise of organized Farmer and Labour groups. Grierson was personally re- elected, defeating Farmer candidate W.T. Bielby by 267 votes. He withdrew from cabinet on January 10, 1921, and did not seek re-election in 1922.

He became well known during late Nizam period of Hyderabad, during the early 20th century, for being chief physician and advisor to the Nizam of the time, Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI, and later becoming a prominent philanthropist in what is known today as the \\"Old City\\" portion of Hyderabad. Early life and career Abdul Husain Arastu Yar Jung was born as Abdul Husain in the then independent state of Hyderabad. Arastu Yar Jung completed medical school and began practicing in what is known today as the \\"Old City\\" of Hyderabad. He was appointed to the staff of Osmania General Hospital, where he eventually became the First Superintendent. Arastu Yar Jung was soon appointed as the First Surgeon to the reigning Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI, the Sixth Nizam of Hyderabad. The Nizam officially conferred him his title; and from that day he was known as Dr. Abdul Husain Arastu Yar Jung (Arastu, Karim and Michelle 2016). He remained a adviser to the Nizam. Alongside this, Arastu Yar Jung became known for serving the needy and the poor for the local communities, even at night, often treating patients at no cost. He also became a physician in Hyderabad. Philanthropy Parts of Southern India and most of Hyderabad were greatly affected by the Bubonic plague epidemic at the turn of the 19th century. Arastu Yar Jung helped treat many of the locals affected, and often invited their whole families to live in separate quarters of his own home - providing ample food and shelter for all who stayed. As a member of the Bohra Muslim jamaat, Arastu Yar Jung was an active contributor to the local community through the Dawoodi Bohra organization. Alongside other active \\"Old City\\" Hyderabad Bohri community members of the time, such as his brother-in-law Sheikh Mohsini, Mullah Abdul Tyeb, and his son-in-law, of the Sk. Hasan Bhai clan, Mullah Mohammed Bhai - a respected Judge for the Hyderabad High Court (now Andhra Pradesh High Court) among others. With Sheikh Mohsini, Arastu Yar Jung was largely responsible for the finance and construction of the Husainialam mosque, approved by the then Syedna Taher Saifuddin and completed in 1913. To honor their contribution and commitment to the community, Arastu Yar Jung and Sheikh Mohsini were both buried near the mosque. The mosque is still in use today, and has since been named the Burhani Masjid, as part of the Anjuman-E-Taheri jamaat. The original structure has been slightly modified, but remains intact, after it was declared a historic landmark in 2003. A strong proponent of education, Arastu Yar Jung, along with many others including Mullah Mohammed Bhai, financed the education of community members - establishing educational trusts that allowed the youth to pursue higher education. Still much of the contributions remain unknown, as he paid attention to be discrete in providing aid, so that the particular person can save face in society - quoting the Quran, \\"What the right hand gives, the left hand should not so much as get a hint of.\\" This implies that the respect of the person being served, and complete confidentiality of the service being rendered is essential in the etiquette of charity. Legacy Arastu Yar Jung encouraged all of his sons to pursue higher education, even sending some abroad to Great Britain and United States, as many noblemen also began doing at the time. Similarly, his daughters were married into families where education was also highly valued. This helped ensure that his values and good will were passed down. Like Arastu Yar Jung, his children were deeply committed to succeeding in education and contributing immensely to the local community. Like families of many Hyderabadi noblemen, many of Arastu Yar Jung's descendants immigrated to the United States and United Kingdom, throughout the 20th century, for the pursuit of higher education opportunities. Today his descendants are scattered around the world, many identifiable by the surname Arastu, with a majority residing in the United States, Canada, India, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates - numbering close to one thousand, and spanning six generations.

His buildings are important as the only ones by an English Baroque architect to show evidence of study of contemporary continental, namely Italian, architecture. Life Archer spent his youth at Umberslade Hall in Tanworth-in-Arden in Warwickshire, the youngest son of Thomas Archer, a country gentleman, Parliamentary Colonel and Member of Parliament, and Ann Leigh, daughter of the London haberdasher, Richard Leigh.The Little London Directory of 1677: the oldest printed list of the merchants and bankers of London. Edited by John Camden Hotton, 1863. A reprint of A Collection of the Names of Merchants living in and about the City of London, 11 October 1677, under licence from Roger L'Estrange. Richard Leigh and his wife Mary had six children, of which Ann was the eldest. The family lived in the parish of St. Helen's Bishopgate. Ann married Thomas Archer, the architect's father in 1649 in the parish of St. Peter-le-Poor. The exact date of Archer's birth is unknown, but can be inferred from the two documentary sources that mention his age. One is an entry in the Oxford University register recording his matriculation at Trinity College on 12 June 1686, aged 17; the other, his epitaph, survives in the parish church of Hale, Hampshire. If these records are accurate, he must have been born between 12 June 1668 and 22 May 1669. Thomas is the only one of the Archer children not to have his birth recorded in the Tamworth-in-Arden parish register, which suggests he may have been born elsewhere.Joseph Foster, Alumni Oxonienses: The Members of the University of Oxford, 1500‚Äì1714 (Oxford: James Parker & Co., 189 1). Marcus Whiffen, Thomas Archer, vol. 3 (London: Art and Technics, 1950). Marcus Whiffen, Thomas Archer, architect of the English baroque, [New ed.] ed. (Los Angeles: Hennessey & Ingalls, 1973). He attended Trinity College, Oxford, from which he matriculated on 12 June 1686.page 10, Thomas Archer Architect of the English Baroque, Marcus Whiffen, 1973, Art and Technics After leaving university, he went on a Grand Tour, spending four years abroad and was influenced by the work of Bernini and Borromini. Churches Among Archer's churches was St John Evangelist, Westminster suggestive of Hawksmoor's baroque influence. Its four towers were originally built to stabilise subsidence. Historians believed that was more likely than following Sir John Vanbrgh's style. Built in 1750, St Paul's, Deptford sweeping semi-circular porticos were not copied for a century until Smirke's magnificent church at St Mary's, Bryanston Square that dominated the street. At St Philip's, Birmingham, now Birmingham Cathedral there was a strong sense of the Italianate Lombardic influences of High Baroque style of churches: ornate, high ceilings, with cupola and dome. External to St Philips is the roof balustrade quite unusual in English church architecture.G.Cobb, The Old Churches of London (1942), p.96 St John's and St Paul's were both built for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. John Summerson said these two buildings \\"represent the most advanced Baroque style ever attempted in England\\". According to the minutes of the Commissioners, Archer also \\"improved\\" Hawksmoor's designs for St Alfege's at Greenwich, although the nature of the improvements, or whether they were implemented, is unknown. Downes suggests the use of the giant order of pilasters around the church may have been Archer's idea. At Hale, Hampshire, he remodelled St Mary's Church, which also contains his memorial, carved by Sir Henry Cheere to Archer's own design. Secular works Archer's secular works included Roehampton House in Surrey, Welford Park in Berkshire, and the Cascade House and the west front and broadly bowed pilastered north front at Chatsworth House. In 1709‚Äì11 Archer designed a Baroque garden pavilion for Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent at Wrest Park, Silsoe, Bedfordshire. After 1712 Archer designed Hurstbourne Priors in Hampshire for John Wallop (later Earl of Portsmouth). He was a founding governor of the Foundling Hospital in London in 1739, but was not involved in the construction of the resulting building, completed c. 1750. The architect for that project was Theodore Jacobsen.

It refers to the process whereby the outermost label of an MPLS tagged packet is removed by a Label Switch Router (LSR) before the packet is passed to an adjacent Label Edge Router (LER). The benefit is that the LSR has to do a label lookup anyway and it doesn't make a difference whether this results in a label swap or pop. However, for the LER this saves one cycle of label lookup. The process is important in a Layer 3 MPLS VPN () environment as it reduces the load on the LER. If this process didn't happen, the LER would have to perform at least 2 label lookups: # The outer label, identifying that the packet was destined to have its label stripped on this router. # The inner label, to identify which Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance to use for the subsequent IP routing lookup. In large, loaded networks the additional time required for second label lookup can make a difference in the overall forwarding performance and reduce buffering. PHP functionality is achieved by the LER advertising a label with a value of 3 to its neighbours. This label is defined as implicit-null and informs the neighbouring LSR(s) to perform PHP.

Context When paying a worker, employers can use various methods and combinations of methods. Some of the most prevalent methods are: paid a wage by the hour (known as \\"time work\\"); paid an annual salary; salary plus commission (common in sales jobs); base salary or hourly wages plus gratuities (common in service industries); salary plus a possible bonus (used for some managerial or executive positions); salary plus stock options (used for some executives and in start-ups and some high tech firms); salary pool systems; gainsharing (also known as \\"profit sharing\\"); paid by the piece ‚Äì the number of things they make, or tasks they complete (known as ‚Äòoutput work‚Äô); or paid in other ways (known as ‚Äòunmeasured work‚Äô). Some industries where piece rate pay jobs are common are agricultural work, cable installation, call centers, writing, editing, translation, truck driving, data entry, carpet cleaning, craftwork and manufacturing. Working for a piece rate does not mean that employers are exempt from paying minimum wage or overtime requirements, which vary among nations and states.\\"Piece Rate Pay System law & Legal Definition\\" http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/piece-rate-pay-system// Employers may find it in their interest to use piece rate pay after examining three theoretical considerations; the cost and viability of monitoring output in a way that accurately measures production so that quality doesn't decrease is first. Variable skill level is second, where piece rates are more effective in a more homogenous workforce. Thirdly, there may be more invasive managerial relations as the management is attempting to test how fast the workers can produce. Employees decide whether to work for piece rate pay if the relative earnings are high, and if other physical and psychological conditions are favorable. Some of these might be job stress, physicality, risks, degree of supervision and ability to work with peers or family members. Employees may also be more or less welcoming to performance pay depending on the leverage and risk. Leverage was defined as ratio of variable pay to base pay, and risk is the probability the employee will see increased benefits with effort. Workers tended to be suspicious of pay packages that were too heavy on variable pay and were concerned it might be a concession to remove cost-of living wage adjustments or to secure wage rollbacks. Establishing a fair rate Under UK law, piece workers must be paid in either at least the minimum wage for every hour worked or on the basis of a ‚Äòfair rate‚Äô for each task or piece of work they do. Output work can only be used in limited situations when the employer doesn't know which hours the worker does (e.g. some home workers). If an employer sets the working hours and the workers have to clock in and out, this counts as time work, not as output work. The fair rate is the amount that allows an average worker to be paid the minimum wage per hour if they work at an average rate. This must be calculated in a set way, a control trial is run to determine the average items produced by equivalent workers, this is divided by 1.2 to reach the agreed average figure, and the fair rate is set to ensure each worker achieves the minimum wage. In a service setting, the output of piece work can be measured by the number of operations completed, as when a telemarketer is paid by the number of calls made or completed, regardless of the outcome of the calls (pay for only certain positive outcomes is more likely to be called a sales commission or incentive pay). Crowdsourcing systems such as Mechanical Turk involve minute information-processing tasks (such as identifying photos or recognizing signatures) for which workers are compensated on a per-task basis. History =Guild system= As a term and as a common form of labor, 'piece work' had its origins in the guild system of work during the Commercial Revolution and before the Industrial Revolution. Since the phrase 'piece work' first appears in writing around the year 1549, it is likely that at about this time, the master craftsmen of the guild system began to assign their apprentices work on pieces which could be performed at home, rather than within the master's workshop. In the British factory system, workers mass-produced parts from a fixed design as part of a division of labor, but did not have the advantage of machine tools or metalworking jigs. Simply counting the number of pieces produced by a worker was likely easier than accounting for that worker's time, as would have been required for the computation of an hourly wage. =Industrial Revolution= Piece work took on new importance with the advent of machine tools, such as the machine lathe in 1751. Machine tools made possible by the American system of manufacturing (attributed to Eli Whitney) in 1799 in which workers could truly make just a single part‚Äîbut make many copies of it‚Äîfor later assembly by others. The reality of the earlier English system had been that handcrafted pieces rarely fit together on the first try, and a single artisan was ultimately required to rework all parts of a finished good. By the early 19th century, the accuracy of machine tools meant that piecework parts were produced fully ready for final assembly. Frederick Winslow Taylor was one of the main champions of the piece rate system in the late 19th century. Although there were many piece rate systems in use, they were largely resented and manipulative. One of the most influential tenets of Scientific Management was Taylor's popularization of the \\"differential piece rate system\\", which relied on accurate measurements of productivity rates to create a \\"standard\\" production output target. Those who were not able to meet the target suffered a penalty and were likely fired. Taylor spread this in published papers in 1895, and the timed piece rate system gave birth to creating modern cost control, and as a result, modern corporate organization.J.C. Spender. (2006). \\"Frederick W. Taylor and John R. Commons: Two Views of Scientific Management\\". http://www.jcspender.com/uploads/Taylor___Commons_n29.pdf Abuse In the mid-19th century, the practice of distributing garment assembly among lower- skilled and lower-paid workers came to be known in Britain as the sweating system and arose at about the same time that a practical (foot-powered) sewing machine, was developed. Factories that collected sweating system workers at a single location, working at individual machines, and being paid piece rates became pejoratively known as sweatshops. There can be improper record keeping at the hands of supervisors attempting to cheat employees, to build piece rate systems that prevent workers from earning higher wages. This is often at the cost of both the worker and the enterprise though, as the quality and sustainability of the business will be threatened by decreases in quality or productivity of workers attempting to stay afloat. Put another way, if the payment for producing a well-made item is not enough to support a worker, then workers will need to work faster, producing more items per hour, while sacrificing quality.Gregorio Billikopf \\"Designing an Effective Piece Rate\\". Agricultural Labor Management, University of California. http://nature.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7research/7calag06.htm Today, piece work and sweatshops remain closely linked conceptually, even though each has continued to develop separately. The label \\"sweatshop\\" now refers more to long hours, poor working conditions and low pay - even if they pay an hourly or daily wage labour instead of a piece rate. Minimum wage In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act requires that all employees, including piece work employees, earn at least the minimum wage. In calculating an appropriate piece work rate, employers must keep track of average productivity rates for specific activities and set a piece work rate that ensures that all workers are able to earn minimum wage. If a worker earns less than the minimum wage, the employer has to pay the difference. Exceptions to this rule include instances where: (i) the worker is a family member of the employer; (ii) if in any calendar quarter of the preceding year there were fewer than 500 person- days of work lasting at least one hour; (iii) in agricultural businesses, if a worker primarily takes care of livestock on the range; (iv) if non-local hand- harvesting workers are under 16, are employed on the same farm as their parent, and receive the piece work rate for those over 16.

He got involved in local politics and was elected mayor of Long Island City three times, from 1887‚Äì89, 1890‚Äì92 and served as its last mayor from 1896‚Äì97, before it was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898.

By nature and by political preference he was a Democrat, but he was voted for simply as 'Paddy,' he was obeyed as 'Paddy,' and the people whom he had once autocratically governed, and a respectable portion of whom had been hostile to him, remembered him as 'Paddy' to the day of his death.\\"\\"Patrick J.

The 58-story, tower is the second-tallest building in Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania, as well as the twenty-third tallest building in the United States. Originally called One Pennsylvania Plaza when the building was first announced in 2001, the Comcast Center went through two redesigns before construction began in 2005. Comcast Center was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects for Liberty Property Trust. At the beginning of 2005, the final redesign and its new name‚Äîthe Comcast Center‚Äîwas unveiled. The building is named after its lead tenant, cable company Comcast, which makes the skyscraper its corporate headquarters. Leasing , Comcast takes up 89 percent of the building. The building features retail and restaurant space and a connection to the nearby Suburban Station. In Comcast Center's lobby is the Comcast Experience, which is a high-definition LED screen that has become a tourist attraction. Designed to be environmentally friendly, the skyscraper is the tallest Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified building in Philadelphia. History =Planning (1999‚Äì2004)= In 1999, class-A office vacancy in the city was at 6.6%, leading developer Willard Rouse to envision a new tower. Eventually the developer settled on the location where he constructed this building, a , $288 per square-foot parcel owned by Equitable Life Assurance Co.\\"Rouse vision complete in new tower\\", Biz Journals. May 12, 2008. Accessed June 12, 2011 In 2000, the architect and Driehaus Prize winner Robert A. M. Stern began working on a design for a skyscraper being planned by Liberty Property Trust in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2001, Liberty Property Trust announced its plan to build the 52-story One Pennsylvania Plaza in Center City. Anticipated US$400 million, One Pennsylvania Plaza was to be and made of kasota stone similar to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The site for the future skyscraper was at 17th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard, a site occupied by a building that housed the Defender Association of Philadelphia and a parking lot. Demolition of the building began in 2002 and ended in 2003. Cable company Comcast had been looking for possible new headquarters space in anticipation of the end of its lease in Centre Square in 2006. Comcast was looking for more than of office space and developers were actively courting the company for their developments. Comcast was the only employer in the city with major expansion plans at the time. Comcast was considering staying in Centre Square, while also contemplating moving their headquarters to the new Cira Centre building or One Pennsylvania Plaza. Comcast was spread out over 10 floors in two buildings at Centre Square and wanted space on contiguous floors. In January 2004, Liberty Property Trust unveiled a redesign for the building. The redesign turned One Pennsylvania Plaza into a 60-story, tower, making it the tallest building in the city at the time. In the redesign, the kasota stone was changed to a lighter granite and a short pyramidal roof was added. The redesign was a result of discussions that had begun in 2003 with Comcast about moving into the tower. On January 3, 2004, Liberty Property Trust signed a 15¬Ω-year lease with Comcast and a construction contract with L.F. Driscoll Co. Liberty Property Trust also unveiled another redesign of the building and its new name, the Comcast Center. The now , 58-story Comcast Center would no longer have a pyramid top and would have a complete glass facade. The architectural model was created by Richard Tenguerian. Controversy Liberty Property Trust hoped to get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site designated a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said it was important to keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%. Both sides of the issue hired law firms, lobbyists, and business associates to promote their positions to city and state officials. A report by the Center City District said if both One Pennsylvania Plaza and the Cira Centre, another skyscraper in the KOZ controversy, were filled by corporations moving from other Center City office towers, the city could lose US$153 million by 2018. A report released by the group of building owners opposed to KOZ says the two buildings could cost the city almost US$91 million a year. In contrast, a report issued by a consulting company hired by Liberty Property Trust said that a KOZ designation for the skyscraper could generate US$27 million for the city. Critics of the KOZ designation also claimed that close relationships between Liberty Property Trust and Comcast and the Rendell administration were inappropriately influencing the governor's position on the issue. When Rendell was mayor of Philadelphia, David L. Cohen, a Comcast executive vice president, was Rendell's chief of staff, and William P. Hankowsky, Liberty Property Trust's chief executive, was director of Philadelphia's development agency. Rendell dismissed the claims, saying \\"Every building owner in town was a contributor to me.\\" Chances the bill would be passed ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided not to bring the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell released US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state. =Construction (2005‚Äì2008)= Comcast Center under construction, 2007 The official groundbreaking ceremony was on March 31, 2005. The ceremony, which was held at night, featured a light show coordinated with a piece of music entitled \\"Elevation\\". The song was composed specifically for the event by Curtis Institute of Music graduate Steven Hackman and recorded by the Curtis Institute of Music Orchestra.Steve Hackman conducts his original piece \\"Elevation\\", YouTube.com, stevehackman08. The groundbreaking also featured Kodo, the Germantown High School drumline, and a ice sculpture of the Comcast Center. As the building was under construction, in March 2006, Liberty Property Trust ran into trouble with Philadelphia's Plumbers Union Local 690, which had issues with the building's waterless urinals. The waterless urinals were part of the plan to make the Comcast Center an environmentally friendly building because they would save an extra of water a year. The plumbers union opposed the waterless urinals, claiming they were unsanitary and would provide less work for the plumbers. Philadelphia's Plumbing Advisory Board approved the waterless urinals on April 5 after a compromise, which stated that the building's owners and city officials would monitor the performance of the waterless urinals, was reached. Piping that would allow water to flow to the urinals in case they needed to be converted was installed in the Comcast Center, which Liberty Property Trust says was always part of the building's plan. Comcast Center's concrete core A week later, on April 13, Liberty Property Trust sold an 80-percent interest in the Comcast Center to German real estate firm CommerzLeasing & Immobilien AG, a subsidiary of Commerzbank AG. The deal completed Liberty Property Trust's planned recapitalization of the anticipated cost of the building, and the value of the joint venture, called Liberty/Commerz 1701 JFK Boulevard L.P., included mortgage debt and equity. On June 18, 2007, the Comcast Center was topped out. The ceremony, which was held in the building's future plaza, featured the raising of a steel beam to the skyscraper's highest point. The beam was signed by workers and guests and as it was raised, on account of tradition, an American flag and a tree sat on the beam. Also sitting on the beam was a statue of Philadelphia- founder William Penn. The statue was there to counteract the 1980s \\"curse\\" of Billy Penn, which prevented Philadelphia's sports teams from winning a championship following the construction of buildings taller than the statue of William Penn on top of the Philadelphia City Hall. The statue of William Penn remained on the beam until it was stolen. The statue was replaced and the \\"curse\\" ended when the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series. Even though the building had not officially opened, Comcast office workers began moving in early December 2007, ahead of the scheduled completion in March 2008.\\"Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA\\", Flickr. October 2009. Accessed June 11, 2011 The Comcast Center officially opened on June 6, 2008. A study sponsored by Comcast and Liberty Property Trust said the construction of the Comcast Center created 17,200 jobs and generated US$2 billion of economic activity for Pennsylvania. Despite opposition by other building owners to construction of the Comcast Center, by the time most space in the Comcast Center had been leased vacancy rates in Center City offices were falling and rents were rising. Even HRPT Properties Trust had leased 70 percent of the space Comcast vacated by 2007. The predictions by opponents did not occur mainly because Comcast ended up leasing 89 percent of the building and the offices for the Comcast Center's second-largest tenant, Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, were new to the city. Building Comcast Center as seen from One Liberty Observation Deck The Comcast Center is the second-tallest building built in America outside of New York City or Chicago since 1993. The Comcast Center has 58 floors, of which 56 are occupiable. The structure of the Comcast Center comprises a central concrete core with steel-framed floors. The building's exterior features a glass curtain wall made of lightly tinted, non- reflective low-emissivity glass. The tower tapers inward towards the top and features two cutouts near the top of the building on the north and south sides. To prevent the tower from swaying too much in the wind, the Comcast Center contains a double-chambered concrete tuned liquid column damper, the largest such damper in North America. Receiving a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating in April 2009, the Comcast Center is the tallest LEED building in Philadelphia. The building was designed to use 40 percent less water than a typical office building, and the plaza was designed to reduce heat-island effect from the pavement by 70 percent. Reducing air conditioning and lighting costs, the low-emissivity glass curtain wall blocks 60 percent of heat while allowing 70 percent of the Sun's light inside. Cheltenham. The skyscraper has of rentable space, including of restaurant and retail space called The Market at the Comcast Center. of retail space is on the underground concourse while the rest is located on the street level. The building features high ceilings with some floors having a ceiling height of . The lower floors on the south side of the building feature four three- story stacked atrias. The building also features a 500-seat concourse level dining court and an 87-space private underground parking garage. ThyssenKrupp provided the building's 30 gearless elevators, seven hydraulic elevators, and two escalators. The Comcast Center faces a half-acre public plaza. The plaza, designed by Lucinda Sanders of OLIN, sits over underground railroad tracks. It features a seasonal outdoor restaurant, Plaza Cafe at Table 31, that is sheltered by a trellis. Between the cafe and the building entrance is a choreographed fountain designed by Wet. The tower's entrance is a tall winter garden. The winter garden entrance directly connects to the underground concourse of Suburban Station. The building also has a lobby entrance that leads to the Arch Street Presbyterian Church adjacent to the tower. The exterior lighting scheme of the building was designed by Quentin Thomas Associates, and consists primarily of white LEDs color-temperature matched to the fluorescent lights used by the interior. Along each floor, the corner spandrel panels feature upward and downward-facing 4,100K LEDs to create the appearance that the length of the building has been bottom-lit by spotlights. The only major consistently active color element can be found at the top of the tuned mass damper; a single row of color-changing LEDs that is programmed to commemorate special events. For example, the top would be colored pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron described the Comcast Center as \\"a respectable work of architecture\\" that was \\"dignified in its stance on the grid, generous in its relationship to the city, responsible in its treatment of the environment\\". She felt the tower's shape reminded her of a giant flash drive.Gibbons, Kent. Philly Critic: Comcast Tower Looks Like ‚ÄòGiant Flash Drive‚Äô, Multichannel News, February 6, 2008 Saffron said the building excelled at the street level, praising the plaza, concourse, and its connection to Suburban Station.

The \\"Comcast Experience\\" LED animation display The Comcast Experience is a tall, wide, high-definition LED screen situated on a wall in the winter garden. The screen is composed of 7.8 million, 4.66mm pitch pixels housed in 6,771 LED modules of the type used in the Barco NX-4 panel. The installation, designed and produced by Niles Creative Group, premiered on June 6, 2008, and runs eighteen hours each day. The content of the video includes panoramic views of Philadelphia historic sites, images of space, dancers, acrobats and actors moving around a background designed to mimic wood paneling of the walls of the lobby. Another part of the installation displays images of cranes and machinery forming the design of a clock that tells the correct time of day. The Comcast Experience quickly became a popular tourist attraction, prompting city officials to add the Comcast Center to its tourism website. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day 2008, a holiday video was included as part of the installation. Humanity in Motion statuary The second piece of art is Jonathan Borofsky's Humanity in Motion. Located in the glass atrium of the winter garden, Humanity in Motion shows ten life-size human figures walking across ten horizontal poles positioned at different levels of the atrium.

Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called \\"Comcast University\\". The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed with a variety of shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors. The retail portion of the tower includes numerous shops and eateries. The shops and eateries include national and regional chains, and initially featured a restaurant called Table 31. Table 31, which had a cafe on the plaza and a restaurant spread over three floors in the tower, was owned by Philadelphia restaurateurs and chefs Georges Perrier and Chris Scarduzio. The restaurant was named after a popular table at the former Perrier and Scarduzio establishment Brasserie Perrier.

It is located close to the Western Springs Stadium, Auckland Zoo and the Western Springs Park. The museum has large collections of civilian and military aircraft and other land transport vehicles. An ongoing programme is in place to restore and conserve items in the collections. This work is largely managed by volunteers but, since the passing of the Museum of Transport and Technology Act in 2000, has been supported by full-time professional museum.Museum of Transport and Technology Act 2000 New public programmes and facilities now promote the collections. MOTAT was established in 1960 by a combination of groups including the Old Time Transport Preservation League, which was formed in 1957 and preserved trams and railway locomotives. MOTAT was formally opened in 1964.MOTAT Official Website - Corporate Information MOTAT 1 ‚Äì Great North Road MOTAT 1 was built around the site of a beam engine pump house, which originally provided Auckland's water supply (system similar to the Crofton Pumping Station and Markfield Beam Engine). The Council engaged the services of famed engineer, William Errington, to design and construct the Pumphouse and Boiler house to provide the first pressurised water supply to Auckland. Adjacent swampland was excavated creating a dammed lake, which is filled by three natural springs. This area is now the Western Springs Lake and parkland. The engine is a Double Woolf Compound built by John Key and Sons of Kirkcaldy in Scotland, who also built the long scrapped Lancashire boilers that originally provided the steam. The Western Springs Water Works officially opened in a small ceremony on 10 July 1877. The pumphouse was superseded by Auckland's extensive dam system and reticulation in 1928. Restoration and earthquake strengthening of the building was completed in 2002 and overhaul of the long dormant Beam Engine commenced at the start of 2005. On 11 October 2007 the engine moved under pneumatic pressure for the first time in 79 years and was finally tested under steam during the evening of 29 November the same year. The Beam engine was re-commissioned in a special public opening on 19 April 2008. A range of other early steam engines are kept in running order including a 1910 Tangye steam engine, an impressive 1911 triple-expansion engine built by Campbell Calderwood from Paisley, Scotland, which was formerly from the ill-fated Sydney Ferry The Greycliffe which sank on 3 November 1927 after being hit by the much larger Union Steam Ship Company‚Äôs Royal Mail Steamship Tahiti with the loss of 40 lives. The engine ended its commercial life in the Tƒ´rau dairy factory. Steam for the Beam Engine and other artifacts provided by a 1957 Daniel Adamson steam boiler, which was formerly used at Frankham's Mill, Te Puna. Exhibits include trams, trains, vintage traction engines, carriages, cars, buses, trolleybuses and trucks, particularly fire engines, electrical equipment, space flight exhibits including a Corporal rocket and general science exhibits. There is also a 'colonial village' of early shops and houses, including a fencible cottage and a blacksmith shop. The MOTAT printery demonstrates type making, type setting and printing on a variety of different manual and mechanical printing presses operated by Volunteers printing giveaways and small publications. A volunteer bindery group also demonstrate their talents and hold classes. In the 1970s visitors to MOTAT were entertained by the MOTAT Chorus, a group of barbershop singers who later became the Auckland City of Sails Chorus. The 'Pioneers of Aviation' Pavilion holds memorabilia of early aviators. The displays include miscellaneous parts from Richard Pearse's experimental aircraft, (together with research supporting the claim that he made uncontrolled hops/flights prior to the Wright brothers), a replica of the craft which was flown and his third aircraft (an attempt at a VTOL tilt rotor craft). The pavilion also holds relics from the Walsh Brothers' flights and school, and a library and archive of transport resources named in memory of the Walsh Brothers available to all MOTAT visitors and via the MOTAT website for virtual visitors. Also celebrated is Charles Kingsford-Smith's trans-Tasman flight in the Southern Cross, Jean Batten's England‚ÄìNew Zealand flight and later record breaking efforts (her Percival Gull is exhibited at Auckland Airport). The larger civil aviation exhibits continue over at MOTAT 2 with displays relating to the Pan American Airways and Imperial Airways flying boats of the late 1930s and TEAL flying boats of the 40s and 50s. The engine from Jean Batten's Percival Gull is displayed at MOTAT 2. The Road transport collection rotationally displays in excess of 100 cars, trucks, motorbikes and emergency vehicles. Some of the iconic vehicles in the collection include one of the first Trekka utility vehicles, New Zealand's only homegrown production vehicle built between 1966 and 1973, based on Czechoslovakian ≈†koda engines and chassis. Other vehicles include a 1960s Cooper Climax race car, an early American Brush Motor Car Company runabout, an International horseless carriage, an Austin Motor Company beer tanker (the first in New Zealand) and a wide number of other vehicles. Also in the collection is one of the Ferguson Company tractors which Edmund Hillary used to lay supply depots for the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, and with which he beat British explorer Dr Vivian Fuchs Sno-Cats to the South Pole on 3 January 1958. MOTAT also houses a small collection of Police vehicles, including former New Zealand Transport Department, later New Zealand Ministry of Transport (M.O.T.) patrol cars and patrol motorbikes, the road policing duties of which were combined into the New Zealand Police in the early 1990s. The NZ Police Collection of 40 plus vehicles were housed at MOTAT for a number of years until 2011. Trams are displayed at MOTAT 1 and operate daily between MOTAT 1's Great North Road Site, via Western Springs Park and Auckland Zoo to MOTAT 2. The extended line was opened by Helen Clark on Friday 27 April 2007.Western Springs Tramway Extension . MOTAT. Retrieved 8 August 2010.

Also known in the past as the 'Sir Keith Park Memorial Airfield', named after Keith Park, the Battle of Britain and Battle of Malta hero, MOTAT's aviation collection is on a separate site, neighbouring the WaitematƒÅ Harbour and Auckland Zoo. It contains memorials to Fleet Air Arm and RAF Bomber Command pilots, radar and other aviation related material, as well as workshops for work on other vehicles, but the main feature is the collection of New Zealand's civil and some Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft. A Grumman Avenger TBF-1 NZ2527 1943 torpedo bomber was completed in December 2013 and is due to go on display in early 2014, it is a RNZAF Pacific combat veteran and representative of Avengers operated by the RN Fleet Air Arm. In November 2011 a Douglas A4K Skyhawk jetfighter was permanently loaned to MOTAT followed by a De Havilland Devon and Aermacchi MB-339 jet trainer in 2012. A BAC Strikemaster may join the collection from the RNZAF. There is also a military section which restores and demonstrates a selection of Second World War military trucks, light tracked vehicles and tanks of Allied forces. The military section has regular open days when the Military Reenactment Society displays and demonstrates the vehicles and uniforms.Official Museum Website MOTAT 2 also has an operational railway with 1 km of track, stations and a selection of former New Zealand Government Railways, light industrial locomotives, wagons and carriages. On 9 September 2011 a new and larger display hangar was opened at MOTAT 2.MOTAT ‚Äì Aviation Hangar The existing blister hangar was moved and restored as part of the same project. With the construction of the new hangar it was now possible to display the restored De Havilland Mosquito and Lockheed Hudson. Short S25 Sunderland Mk V and NAC DC3 Dakota were in moved inside as their overhauls and external painting was completed towards the end of summer 2012. The Short S45A Solent Mk 4, Ventura and top dressing Lodestar will be housed in due course as restorations and building provisions allow.

Also six diesel, petrol and petrol electric locomotives, including the DA class which was built to replace the K class from the 1950s through the 1960s and became the most prolific mainline locomotive in New Zealand. *Railway carriages ‚Äì the collection also includes stations, carriages, wagons and other rolling stock. *Tram collection ‚Äì the collection includes over 20 electric, steam and cable trams, many of which are operational, with support equipment and vehicles from former New Zealand tramway systems of Auckland, Wellington, Wanganui and the Mornington Cable tram system in Dunedin. Auckland's horse-drawn tramway opened in 1884 and was replaced by the electric tram system in 1902, closing in 1956. The final closure of an original street tramway was in Wellington in 1964. An 1883 Dunedin Cable Car trailer is the sole South Island tramway exhibit and there are additional trams from Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. Street furniture used on the Auckland Tramways can be seen on the Western Springs Tramway including traction pole skirts and cast iron pillar boxes dating from the 1900s, concrete safety zones, platform information signs, Cincinnati Recording Clocks, Queen Street Dispatchers Cabin all dating from the 1920s and some used into the trolleybus era. The museum is one of five operational Museum and Heritage Tramways in New Zealand. *Petrol / diesel bus collection ‚Äì contains a significant collection of historic buses from the Auckland region, including a 1924 White Motor Company 4-cylinder side-valve petrol engine, wooden-bodied 23 seat omnibus, through a 1954 Bedford SB, petrol engine, 35-seat lightweight wooden-body bus specifically built for Grafton Bridge services, through to a 1978 M.A.N SL200 No.1603 retired in the 2010s. *Trolleybus collection ‚Äì this collection contains a representative cross- section of trolleybuses which operated in Auckland between 1938 and 1980. First used on a 1 km department store-operated route in central Auckland from 1938, the trolleybus system later duplicated and then replaced the aging tram system between 1949 and 1956. The trolleybuses were in turn replaced by diesel buses in 1980. Tram service A MOTAT to Zoo tram service operated by Melbourne W2 class tram #321, Auckland, 2006. Tramlines on sleepered track set under bitumen were laid within the museum boundaries with trams commencing operation on 16 December 1967. The Museum tramline was later extended beyond the Museum grounds along Gt. North Road and opened on 19 December 1980. A further extension along Motions Road to Auckland Zoo commenced services on 5 December 1981 using rail set in mass concrete. In 2006‚Äì07 the tram line was further extended by a distance of 636 metres, to the aviation hangar at MOTAT 2, the service commencing on 27 April 2007. The tramway is dual gauge, employing 4-foot and 4-foot inches gauges, the rail welded and set in mass concrete.

Although he spent all his life in al-Andalus and did not travel to the East like some other Andalusian scholars, most of his book's material is drawn from the East Islamic world. Also, Ibn Abd Rabbih quoted no Andalusian compositions other than his own. He included in his book his 445-line Urjuza, a poem in the meter of the rajaz in which he narrates the warlike exploits of Abd al-Rahman al- Nasir, along with some of his eulogies of the Umayyads of al-Andalus.Boullata ,2007 Translations * Ibn  øAbd Rabbih, The Unique Necklace: Al- øIqd al- Farƒ´d, trans. by Issa J.

From its source Lake M√©gantic in the Estrie region, it runs northwards to flow into the St. Lawrence River opposite Quebec City. Geography The river's drainage area is , initially in the Appalachian Mountains, then in the low-lands of the St. Lawrence, and include 236 lakes covering and approximately 180,000 inhabitants. Its annual medium flow at the station of Saint-Lambert-de-Lauzon is , varying from (low water) to (spring high water), with historical maximum of . Its principal tributaries are: *Rivi√®re du Loup (not to be confused with Rivi√®re du Loup in the Bas-Saint-Laurent), also known as the Rivi√®re Lini√®re *Famine River *Beaurivage River *Saint-Victor River The river's basin has nearly 50 percent of the faunal richness of Quebec, namely 330 out of 653 vertebrate species known in the province can be found here. The river, and the Chaudi√®re Falls which it passes over en route, are popular outdoor recreation areas. History The Abenaki indigenous people resided close to the Chaudi√®re Falls and named it \\"Kikonteku\\", meaning \\"River of the Fields\\". On the charts of Samuel de Champlain, it was given the name \\"Etchemin River\\" (a name now used for another river whose drainage area borders with that of the Chaudi√®re River). It was called \\"Rivi√®re du Sault de la Chaudi√®re\\" for a period of time before it became simply \\"Rivi√®re Chaudi√®re\\" towards the end of the 18th century. This name refers to the waterfall close to its mouth. Its location was strategic for French colonization during the 18th century because the river was a natural link between New France and the British colonies to the south. It was also used by Benedict Arnold at the time of his 1775 expedition in the invasion of Quebec. In 1823, gold was found along its shores in the Eastern Townships of Quebec.Law-West, Don. \\"Gold\\", in The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig Publishing, 1988), Volume 2, p.908. On 6 July 2013 the Lac-M√©gantic derailment caused a major oil spill which contaminated the river at its source at Lac M√©gantic. Downstream communities such as Saint-Georges ( to the northeast) were forced to obtain potable water from alternate sources and residents asked to limit their water consumption. Floating barriers were installed in an attempt to contain the contamination. =21st century= The Chaudi√®re valley mostly crosses the Beauce area. The river impacts its industries and way of life, particularly during spring run- off, when it frequently overflows into populated areas, in spite of the 160 dams and levees. The river flows through several cities and villages of the area such as Sainte-Marie, Saint-Georges, Beauceville, and Saint-Joseph-de- Beauce. The river is a popular location for outdoor sports, particularly at Lac-M√©gantic and at Parc des Chutes-de-la-Chaudi√®re. Located close to the mouth of the river at L√©vis, this park offers cycling and hiking trails, as well as a footbridge suspended above the river which offers a view of the waterfalls. The falls have been harnessed for hydro-electric power since the beginning of the 20th century. The dam was rebuilt in 1999 on the remains of the old installations, and now consists of a small 24 MW power station.

It takes its name from the Tell-settlement of Ezero. Ezero follows the copper age cultures of the area (Karanovo VI culture, Gumelni≈£a culture, Kodzadjemen culture and Varna culture), after a settlement hiatus in Northern Bulgaria. It bears some relationship to the earlier CernavodƒÉ III culture to the north. Some settlements were fortified. The Ezero culture is interpreted as part of a larger Balkan-Danubian early Bronze Age complex, a horizon reaching from Troy Id-IIc into Central Europe, encompassing the Baden of the Carpathian Basin and the Co≈£ofeni culture of Romania. According to Hermann Parzinger, there are also typological connections to Poliochne IIa-b and Sitagroi IV. Economy Agriculture is in evidence, along with domestic livestock. There is evidence of grape cultivation. Metallurgy was practiced. Interpretation Within the context of the Kurgan hypothesis, it would represent a fusion of native \\"Old European culture\\" and intrusive \\"Kurgan culture\\" elements. It could also represent an Anatolian-influenced culture, either coming from Anatolia (in Renfrew's hypothesis), or heading to Asia Minor. Notes Sources * G.Il. Georgiev et al.

It is a founding member of the Rugby Football Union, and is one of the oldest football clubs (of any code). It fields teams in both men's and women's rugby; the men's first team currently play in the RFU Championship following their promotion from National League 1 at the end of the 2019-20 season, while the women's first team play in the Women's Championship. History Formed in 1861, it is one of the oldest football clubs in the world and holds a significant place in the history of association football, playing in the first ever match under the rules of the Football Association on 19 December 1863, against the Barnes Club, even though it was not a member of the Football Association. In 1878 it hosted the first ever floodlit match and in 1909 played in the inaugural match at Twickenham Stadium, the home of English rugby. Richmond always traditionally played without a number 13 (similar to Bath) ‚Äì the outside centre would wear 14, right wing 15 and fullback 16. However, during the professional era they adopted squad numbering; meaning rather than rugby's usual method of giving numbers 1‚Äì15 to the starting line- up, players were assigned a number for the season, as seen in football. Back in the amateur leagues, Richmond returned to their traditional numbering system before promotion to the National Leagues in 2008 saw them forced to adopt the uniform 1‚Äì15 numbering system according to RFU laws. Professional era In 1996, the then third division club was bought by financial markets trader and Monaco tax exile Ashley Levett. Levett turned the club into the first professional team in England, and began buying in big names to push the club up the leagues, including Ben Clarke from Bath, the first ¬£1million signing. The club outgrew the Richmond Athletic Ground and became tenants at the Madejski Stadium in Reading. But the crowds and revenues from competition meant that Levett was continually financing the club, and so he placed it in administration in March 1999. The professional Richmond club and professional London Scottish F.C. were both merged into London Irish, who moved to the Stoop Memorial Ground before taking up tenancy at Madejski the following year.Sugar daddies Four for whom the game turned sour The Independent - 23 January 2005 This period of hesitancy and uncertainty resulted in many of the professional players leaving the club pre-merger, and returning to their original home-teams. The amateur club was reformed in 2000, and the club rejoined the leagues as an amateur club at the bottom of the pyramid. Post administration After the professional era, hooker Andy Cuthbert remained at the club and captained the side for several years. Despite its lowly league position, Richmond has still managed to attract some top class players - former South Africa captain Bobby Skinstad joined for the 2005‚Äì06 season, Chilean fly-half Sebastian Berti joined in 2006 and England Students' wing Joe Ajuwa was a regular starter in the 1st XV. Under head coach Andy Maren the club climbed through the lower ranks of the England rugby divisions, from Herts & Middlesex 1 (ninth level) to London 1 (fifth level) in four years, amassing a perfect record of 83 straight wins in league play in the process. However, the club seemingly stalled at that level, continuing to put together winning seasons, but failing to gain promotion in 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Richmond laid out a serious plan for promotion - something they had failed to achieve in the past two seasons, one reason being they had not had any semi-professional players on their books. For the 2007‚Äì08 season, the club recruited a number of semi-professional players to boost Richmond's promotion chances. One of these players was USA international Jon Hartman. Richmond eventually achieved promotion, winning all but one of their League games. The coach, Brett Taylor, laid out plans for the club to be in National League 2 South in two seasons, and attempts were made to structure the colts teams into an effective feeder system for the 1st XV. However, during summer 2008, London Scottish were boosted financially and subsequently signed Taylor as their head coach. Richmond appointed Geoff Richards to take his place. Following two years in National League Two, Geoff Richards decided not to renew his contract citing differences in opinion between the board and himself on how the club should move forward. In 2009‚Äì10 Richmond appointed Oxford University Director of Rugby Steve Hill to take over after fourteen years in charge of the university side. Within two years (summer 2011) promotion was achieved and Richmond played in National League 1 until the end of the 2015-16 season when they achieved a further promotion into the Green King IPA Championship. Following three seasons in the Championship, Richmond were relegated at the end of the 2018-19 season and forced to return to National League 1. They hit back strongly in season 2019-20, winning 20 out of 25 matches in National League 1 to finish top of the league and earn promotion back to the Championship. Current standings Youth Richmond's youth section is also highly successful - London Irish fullback Delon Armitage was a member of the mini section, and London Wasps' centre Dominic Waldouck earned an England callup for the 2008 tour of New Zealand, having progressed through the agegroups at Richmond. London Wasps No.8 Hugo Ellis, another product of Richmond's youth section, captained Wales U16s, as well as England at U19 and was the England U20 Captain in the 2008 Grand Slam winning side, also reaching the finals of the iRB Junior World Championship. Yet another former Richmond Youth, Joe Simpson, winning his first full England cap in 2011 Rugby World Cup, also of London Wasps, was scrum half for the U20s. Simpson was in the England Sevens squad for the first round of the 2007‚Äì08 IRB Sevens World Series; Sevens being an important stepping stone for the development of the best youth talent. In the 2009‚Äì10 season a colts team was revived based on the highly rated U17 age group team of the previous season, and several U19 players returning to further bolster the squad. They entered the National Colts Cup and having defeated eight opponents most notably Blackheath, they beat former champions Old Northamptonians, 25‚Äì12 at Franklin's Gardens. Home ground Richmond play at the Athletic Ground, Richmond, which borders Royal Mid Surrey Golf Club, and is close to other sporting facilities such as Richmond Swimming Pool, Old Deer Park and also a gym. The complex includes two pitches (pitches 3 & 4) by the front gate, the 1st team pitch and perpendicular to that, pitch 2. The site also has a disused driving range behind the 1st team pitch which has three pitches on it, and a disused bowls club. One side of the pitch has a large concrete all-seater stand, under which are the changing rooms, a canteen, shop, physio room and two bars. Also on this southern side of the pitch is a disused cricket pavilion which also contains several more changing rooms and showers. During the early professional years, a temporary stand was erected along the north side of the pitch. Later on in the professional era, Richmond 1st team moved to the Madejski Stadium, Reading, where they played until bankruptcy. The stadium would later become London Irish's home ground, and was an early example of London rugby clubs playing in football grounds ‚Äì London Wasps played at Loftus Road before moving to Adams Park, and Saracens moved to Vicarage Road. Rivalries Richmond contested the first ever rugby match with Blackheath F.C., and the clubs have continued to play an annual fixture to uphold the tradition ‚Äì now referred to as the longest-running annual fixture in rugby. As of 2013‚Äì14, the two clubs are in the same league, after many years apart, meaning that they play each other at least twice during the regular season, in addition to the traditional pre-season fixture. Richmond share the Athletic Ground with London Scottish, and this rivalry is very intense. Both sides experienced a high point at the beginning of the professional era and played in the Premiership. Both teams also fell into administration and dropped down to a level well below the national leagues, and though the routes taken have been slightly different, both clubs have battled their way up the leagues. As of 2013‚Äì14, London Scottish were in the Championship ‚Äì one division above Richmond. In years when the clubs are in the same division, the two \\"home\\" and \\"away\\" matches are two of the most well-attended and hotly contested of the year. For the 2020-21 season, Richmond re-join their rivals in the Championship, having won promotion from National League 1. Richmond also have a local rivalry with Barnes who they have recently frequently played as both sides sought to move into the national leagues. At youth level, Richmond's strongest rivalry tends to be with nearby Rosslyn Park. A Richmond vs Rosslyn Park game is always surrounded by controversy of some sort.

History The complex was finished in 1958 on the site of a former quarry, and consisted of six seven-story brick apartment buildings, each containing approximately 67 units. The housing complex was spread across 12 acres and located next to the Kensington Expressway (New York State Route 33) and behind Erie County Medical Center. The site was built by New York State using bonds and managed & maintained by the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority. End of use With reduced federal funding and increased operating and utility cost, maintenance of the buildings began to suffer and living conditions of the Glenny Drive Apartments began to decline. By the end of the 1970s, Kensington Heights had a vacancy rate of 64.7% (240 vacant units out of 371 available units). In 1980, a relocation plan was approved and the remaining residents were relocated. The site remained vacant for nearly three decades, becoming significantly deteriorated and vandalized in the process. Demolition began in 2009 but was quickly stopped after concerns about asbestos removal in the buildings. Demolition resumed in 2012. The Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority put the property for sale in July 2016 with one tower still standing. Erie County Medical Center purchased the property in 2017 and plan to use the site for parking. The last tower was demolished in October 2018.

The corporation provides technical guidance and advice on all aspects of space missions to military, civil, and commercial customers. As the FFRDC for national-security space, Aerospace works closely with organizations such as the United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to provide \\"objective technical analyses and assessments for space programs that serve the national interest\\". Although SMC and NRO are the primary customers, Aerospace also performs work for civil agencies as well as international organizations and governments in the national interest. History On July 1, 1954, the Western Development Division (WDD) of the United States Air Force was established, under the command of Brig. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever. WDD was responsible for the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile. The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (RW) was identified as the civilian organization responsible for systems engineering for the ICBM program. Their Space Technology Laboratories (STL) was responsible for all missile tasks. Despite early successes, there was criticism from both government and industry on the role RW played as a system engineer, in particular, that RW held a privileged position with the Air Force. In 1958 RW merged with Thompson Products to become TRW and the Space Technology Laboratories became an independent subsidiary of TRW, but concerns regarding conflicts of interest persisted. In September 1959, United States Congress issued House Report 1121 which recommended that STL be converted into a non-profit institution.\\"The Aerospace Corporation, Its Work 1960-1980\\", pages 12-17. Library of Congress Catalogue Card No. 80-67774 Congress wanted the establishment of an organization, free from conflict of interest, to aid the Air Force in \\"applying the full resources of modern science and technology to the problem of achieving those continuing advances in ballistic missiles and military space systems.\\" On June 3, 1960, Aerospace was established under the laws of the State of California as a nonprofit corporation.Davis Dyer, TRW: Pioneering Technology and Innovation Since 1900 (Harvard Business School Press, 1998), p231AIR FORCE BALLISTIC MISSILE MANAGEMENT (Formation of Aerospace Corporation) H. Rept. 87-324, 1 May 1961, page 15. On June 25, 1960, at a press conference held at the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Division headquarters in El Segundo, California, Lt. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever announced the \\"formation of a new nonprofit organization, The Aerospace Corporation, to serve the Air Force in the scientific and technical planning and management of missile-space programs.\\" Among the earliest projects it supported were the Dyna-Soar orbital spaceplane, Project Mercury, and the man-rating of the Atlas (rocket) intercontinental ballistic missile. The Aerospace Corporation provided general systems engineering and technical direction for the Titan II missile, first tested in 1962, which became the launch vehicle for Project Gemini. Other notable projects of the 1960s include the advanced ballistic re-entry system (ABRES), the Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), and the Defense Support Program (DSP). During the 1970s, Aerospace began performing advanced space program analysis and program studies for NASA's development of the Space Transportation System (STS), more commonly known as the space shuttle. Aerospace also began tests on airborne UHF terminals for the Air Force Satellite Communications System, AFSATCOM. In the mid-70s Aerospace assumed general systems engineering and integration responsibility for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Beginning in 1973, a program office was established to assist the Air Force in the creation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). In recognition of their GPS collaboration, Aerospace shared the 1992 Robert J. Collier Trophy, the nation's highest award for aeronautical achievement, \\"for the most significant development for safe and efficient navigation and surveillance of air and spacecraft since the introduction of radio navigation 50 years ago.\\" Throughout the 1980s, Aerospace supported the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), the Milstar and DSCS satellite communication systems, and antisatellite (ASAT) programs. They provided planning, design, and evaluation for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) and the Consolidated Space Operations Center at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. During this same time period, the company also provided systems engineering and integration for launch vehicles, including the Atlas, Titan II, Titan IV, and Delta II. In the 1990s, Aerospace participated in the planning and development of system requirements for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, the next generation of launch vehicles. They continued to provide launch vehicle systems engineering for the Atlas II, Delta III, and Titan IVB. Satellite program support included Wideband Gapfiller, Space Based Laser, the Ultrahigh-Frequency Follow-On program, and the Global Broadcast Service. Throughout the second half of the 90s, the corporation conducted independent assessments for the International Space Station, provided technical support for the Cassini spacecraft, and supported the acquisition of the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellite constellation. Most recently, The Aerospace Corporation provided further technical assistance to EELV programs including the Atlas V and Delta IV, and supported planning for Space Radar to provide global persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance to the Department of Defense. Aerospace has been involved in the analysis of concept designs for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (SSTS). Aerospace plays an integral role in the development of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) program that will replace the Milstar system. Another system that Aerospace was supporting is the Transformational Satellite Communications System MILSATCOM architecture to link military and reconnaissance communication networks. However, it was canceled per the recommendations of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates due to DoD budgetary constraints.http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1341 Aerospace remains a significant partner in the continuing evolution of the GPS system. Aerospace has been playing a leading role in the planning and acquisition of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 2005, Aerospace supported the Air Force Affordable Responsive Spacelift (ARES) launch system demonstration program. Capabilities The Aerospace Corporation, as the FFRDC for national security space, primarily supports the Space and Missile Systems Center of the Air Force Space Command, as well as the National Reconnaissance Office. Their 50-year history working side by side with these organizations has made Aerospace the national memory and data repository for launch and satellite systems. They provide scientific and engineering support for launch, space, and related ground systems that serve the national interest. The Department of Defense has identified five core competencies for the Aerospace FFRDC: launch certification, system-of-systems engineering, systems development and acquisition, process implementation, and technology application. Aerospace also manages support to programs for NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as other civil and some commercial space customers. The Aerospace Corporation sponsors several annual conferences and workshops including planetary defense, space systems engineering, space power, and spacecraft thermal control. Organization =Space Systems Group= The Space Systems Group works with the Air Force, government, and industry partners to develop military satellites and advanced national-security satellite systems. It oversees four major spacecraft and space system areas: communications, surveillance, weather, and navigation. Much emphasis is placed upon the life cycle for systems‚Äîas space programs are designed, acquired, and fielded.

He held the rank of an 8th dan Aikikai. Sugano was born in Otaru, Hokkaido. Sugano had been learning judo for six years when, around the age of 18, he went to train in aikido. Sugano entered the Aikikai Hombu Dojo in 1957 and by 1959 was a direct student of Morihei Ueshiba. In 1965 he was appointed by Ueshiba to introduce aikido in Australia. He remained there for 15 years, founding the organisation Aiki Kai Australia.Aiki Kai (Australia) official website, includes some historical information and \\"newsletter\\" magazines. Over 40 dojo, including every capital city. At the request of Nobuyoshi Tamura, Sugano went to Europe and stayed in Belgium, Luxembourg and France. Starting in 1988, he resided in New York City where he co-instructed with Yoshimitsu Yamada at the New York Aikikai. Sugano maintained regular contact with the Aikikai Hombu Dojo and also the Ueshiba family. He traveled extensively during the year to give aikido seminars, mainly in Europe and South East Asia. He visited Australia twice yearly and Malaysia once yearly to conduct the National Training Schools and dan grading. Sugano's aikido was known for possessing both speed and power. His teaching emphasized timing and distance, within a fundamental study of basic technique. Weapons instruction followed a more organic style, with very little study of formal kata. Sugano's weapons instruction focused on correct body positioning (hanmi) and paired practice, which again emphasized the necessity of timing and distance. In 2003, Sugano suffered a below the knee amputation, but he continued to teach and demonstrate aikido without any severe limitation. A medical fund was set up to cover his ongoing medical costs. Sugano died in New York City on August 29, 2010.Seiichi Sugano Shihan passes away in New York City The Foundation he established in Australia prior to his death, continues to promote Sugano's aikido legacy internationally. Three of Sugano's students were promoted to 7th dan on his recommendation: Tony Smibert (Tasmania), Robert Botterill (Melbourne) and Hanan Janiv (Canberra). They had also been awarded the title of Shihan.

Founded in 1835, the school began as a church-supported school for young women called Livingston Female Academy. The original Board of Trustees of Livingston Female Academy was selected in 1836, and four of the seven board members were Presbyterians. The university serves students in several academic colleges and divisions on a campus in west-central Alabama. UWA offers a wide arrangement of degree programs including associate, bachelor's, master's,educational specialist, and educational doctorate degrees. Its athletics teams, known as the West Alabama Tigers, are members of the Gulf South Conference and compete in the NCAA's Division II in all sports except two. The men's and women's rodeo teams compete in the Ozark Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association.  History  = Early history = The University of West Alabama began as Livingston Female Academy in 1835. As a church-related female academy, it admitted its first students in 1839. The school was established by ethnic Scots-Irish Presbyterians, who controlled the majority of seats on the first board of trustees selected in 1836. The purpose of the school was to educate future teachers, while also offering course work in art, music, languages, and home economics. Tuition at this time was $20 annually with an additional $25 charged for piano lessons and $10 for French language and embroidery. Jones Hall was the first building constructed on the campus in 1837, and was located near what is now Brock Hall. (The building was lost to fire in the 1890s). On January 15, 1840, state lawmakers incorporated Livingston Female Academy, granted it tax-exempt status, and gave the board the authority to establish rules and regulations. Julia Tutwiler Livingston Female Academy awarded its first diploma in 1843 to Elizabeth Houston, the daughter of M. L. Houston, a prominent local businessman and a school trustee. The first principal of the school was A. A. Kimbrell, followed by Margaret McShan. In 1853, Dr. Robert Dickens Webb arrived in Sumter County and served as a trustee for more than 40 years. He led the school during the American Civil War and Reconstruction through the 1870s, helping to keep the institution open. The main administration building that sits in the middle of campus today is named in his honor. In 1878, the institution changed its name to Livingston Normal College. Education reformer Julia Strudwick Tutwiler joined the faculty in 1881 as co-principal with her uncle, Carlos Green Smith, former president of the University of Alabama. In 1882‚Äì1883, state lawmakers provided $2,500 for tuition and supplies; Alabama was the first southern state to fund the education of women. Tutwiler and state legislator Addison Gillespie Smith helped secure this appropriation. In 1883, the school was renamed the Alabama Normal College for Girls and Livingston Female Academy, to better reflect the new mission of the institution, providing students with choices of either two- or four-year programs. \\"Normal training\\" was the term used at that time to describe teacher education that represented high school plus two years of college education. The Normal College presented its first diplomas at the 1886 commencement exercises. In 1890, Tutwiler was named president of the college. She is the only woman to have been president. During her tenure, Tutwiler aided in establishing the Alabama Girls' Industrial Institute (now the University of Montevallo) and in having the first women admitted to the University of Alabama in 1893. In the early 20th century new leadership brought a new name to the college as well. George William Brock was hired by the trustees in 1907 to oversee the institution's financial affairs. Following Tutwiler's retirement in 1910, Brock assumed the presidency. Alumni began meeting in honor of Tutwiler in 1910 and formed the first alumni association. Men were admitted to the institution as regular students in 1915. Foust Hall was built in 1922 as a lab school where college professors taught, and students observed and participated in classroom instruction. The building's open-air plan with a central courtyard became a building design familiar to many Alabamians. In 1928, both Bibb Graves Hall and Brock Hall were added to the physical plant under this plan. = State university = The Alamuchee-Bellamy Covered Bridge on campus In 1929, the Alabama State Board of Education took over supervision and renamed the facility the Livingston State Teachers College. Under George William Brock, in 1929 the school founded a student newspaper called Campus Lights (now called The Muse). A football team was added in 1931. With striped uniforms, the college took the tiger as its mascot, and the sports teams continue to be known as the UWA Tigers; red and white are the school colors. After president Brock retired in 1936, Noble Franklin Greenhill took over and served until 1944. Under Greenhill, campus life flourished as social sororities and intercollegiate sports in baseball, basketball, and football were added. The first homecoming celebration was held in 1939. World War II brought such a decline in enrollment that the college nearly closed. When William Wilson Hill assumed the presidency in 1944 after Greenhill left, he commissioned studies to determine if the institution should continue as a four-year college. Hill began with only 92 students, so he set out to recruit veterans. With more men on campus, the interest in sports was revived, and servicemen were aided financially in going to college by the GI Bill, which increased the educational level of a generation of men. Tiger Stadium was built in 1952. The first campus fraternities were established during Wilson's presidency. The college gained a reputation for teacher education in the region and state through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The mission of the institution was broadened in 1957 when, under the leadership of Delos Culp (1954‚Äì1963), the school's name was changed to Livingston State College. Graduate-level classes were added, and the state board of education began awarding master's degrees in professional education under a new graduate division. Kelly Hester Land was awarded the first master's degree, and a writing scholarship competition and building are named for her. Under John E. Deloney (1963‚Äì1973), the college had substantial growth, so it expanded its campus, to more than with a lake surrounded by nature trails, open to the community as well as college population. In 1967, the U.S. Office of Education approved a grant for the institution to receive campus renovations and updates. During the same year, an act of the Legislature created Livingston University with its own Board of Trustees. In 1969, a longtime historic landmark in Sumter County, the Alamuchee-Bellamy Covered Bridge (built 1861), was restored and moved on campus by the Sumter County Historical Society. It spans the northeast corner of Duck Pond behind Reed Hall. The number of faculty was increased during Deloney's presidency as well, and the school's colleges and divisions started taking shape. In 1973, Asa N. Green (1973‚Äì1994) became president; he oversaw the establishment of the Ira D. Pruitt School of Nursing and dual-degree programs with Auburn University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He worked to establish a consortium of 13 schools to create a marine biology program and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. More buildings were added and renovated across campus. During the late 1970s, an area was reserved on campus for the construction of Lake LU. Pre-professional programs were established, and the first Ira D. Pruitt Division of Nursing class earned associate degrees in 1976. Overall, 153 degrees were awarded during commencement exercises in May that same year. In 1977, Dr. Ralph M. Lyon, university educator and administrator, retired from his position, and was honored for his tenure. His wife presented the university with a handcrafted ceremonial mace in his dedication. The mace is used at yearly commencement exercises. Not long after the 1977 commencement, history professor William E. Gilbert was found dead off campus. In the early 1980s, a new computer system was installed on campus to support the university's computer information processing systems major. During the 1985‚Äì1986 academic year, the university observed its 150th anniversary. After Green resigned, Don C. Hines (1994‚Äì1998) assumed the post of president and brought additional change. Today, the rodeo complex on campus is named in his honor. Among students, Hines is most remembered for bringing collegiate rodeo to campus. UWA competes in the Ozark Region and has won regional championships in both the men and women's divisions. In addition, individual competitors have placed nationally in bull- riding and barrel racing. Hines brought more computers to campus and established new programs in psychology and forestry. In 1995, despite a lack of support for a name change, the institution, considering that its regional educational mission was not reflected in its name (some thought that it sounded like a private school), adopted the name The University of West Alabama. Ed Roach (1998‚Äì2002) assumed the presidency in 1998 and set about integrating technology into every aspect of UWA life. He established the Technology 2000 campaign and helped establish UWA as one of the first wireless institutions in the region. Women's sports received a boost under his leadership. During this period, the UWA Softball Complex was completed. In February 2002, he stepped down from his position as president. The Board of Trustees met to choose a replacement on an interim basis from university employees David Taylor, Richard Holland, Roy Underwood, and Clemit Spruiell. = Present day = Logo representing the university's 175th anniversary The 2019 Homecoming Court Richard Holland, an alumnus of the institution and former dean of the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, was selected by trustees to take over the position. Six months later, he was named the next university president by a unanimous vote. Holland is the first UWA graduate to serve as president. However, UWA's board of trustees placed him on paid leave and voted to not renew his contract in March 2014 after he challenged the board's review of his performance. Enrollment continues to grow each year. After hovering around the 2,000 mark for a few years, that number was exceeded in the fall of 2002. In 2005, enrollment reached the 3,000 mark for the first time with a combined 3,090 students on campus and online. That number continued to rise the following year to 3,633 and topped 4,000 in 2007 when 4,186 students were enrolled. When the fall semester rolled around, the university was just shy of the 5,000 mark at 4,888. In 2009, a higher education center was added in neighboring Demopolis. Dr. Don C. Hines died on August 26 from cancer. UWA was temporarily on probation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation body in 2011. It was removed from probation on December 5, 2011.  Academics  UWA offers more than 60 undergraduate programs and 10 graduate programs through its academic colleges and divisions at the bachelor's, master's, educational specialist, and educational doctorate levels. These colleges and divisions include: *College of Business *Julia Tutwiler College of Education *College of Liberal Arts *College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics *Division of Online Programs *Division of Technology *Ira D. Pruitt School of Nursing *School of Graduate Studies Degrees in each academic college and division are awarded at the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Master's degree and Educational specialist levels. Students are awarded an Associate degree from the Ira D. Pruitt School of Nursing. Upon graduation from the University of West Alabama, students may choose to earn a Bachelor's degree in nursing through a partnership with the University of Alabama.  Campus  The University of West Alabama is a single-campus university located in the heart of downtown Livingston on U.S. Highway 11. The campus is on the western border of Alabama. Larger cities close by include Meridian (30 minutes), Tuscaloosa (50 minutes), and Birmingham. The small population in the city of Livingston and Southern hospitality give UWA its small-town atmosphere that many students come to appreciate. The UWA campus includes nature trails, a lake, and sculptures. Recent campus beautification projects have enhanced the natural beauty that can be found on campus. = Facilities = Bibb Graves Hall on the campus of the University of West Alabama The University of West Alabama campus includes many buildings.

Student life  = Housing life = Although the university does not require students to live on campus, UWA strongly encourages students to live in a residence hall their freshman and sophomore years. Research has shown that students who live on campus are much more likely to graduate from college than students who live off-campus. Students who receive a Trustee Scholarship from the university or participate in certain activities such as varsity-level athletics may be required to live on campus. = Media and entertainment = The Paragon 2006‚Äì2009 copies The official student newspaper is Muse. It is published weekly by students and advised by members of the UWA faculty. First published in 1940, the newspaper was called Livingston Life until 1995 when it changed to The Life. This lasted until 2010, when The Life was rebranded into Muse. Students also produce the official University of West Alabama yearbook called The Paragon. Much like the campus newspaper, the yearbook is published by a student staff with a faculty advisor. It is unknown when the first yearbook was published. In addition, The Sucarnochee Review is a creative-writing and art journal published by the university's Department of Languages and Literature. The journal got its start on campus in the 1970s. Students serve as staff members for the journal under a faculty advisor and faculty advisory board. Also on campus, the university's theatre program presents two full-length plays each year. These are performed by members of the student body with an advisor during the fall and spring semesters.

Heroism & career On March 25, 2003, during an ambush while advancing upon Baghdad, Chontosh aggressively attacked an entrenched enemy position, resorting to using captured enemy weaponry when his M16 ran out of ammunition. He is reported to have killed at least 20 enemy soldiers during the incident. Chontosh returned to Iraq during the second half of 2004 as the company commander of India Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. During this time his company took part in Operation Phantom Fury, the second assault on Fallujah in November 2004. Of the 158 Marines he commanded, only 3 were killed in action and 25 were wounded. During this time his company was also the focus of a Fox News documentary titled Breaking Point: Company of Heroes. He also served as the 8th Company Officer at the United States Naval Academy and the Officer Rep for the Naval Academy Women's Ice Hockey Team (2011-2013) There have been some news articles on the perceived lack of coverage that was awarded to this and other medal ceremonies. The controversy over the coverage or lack of coverage of Chontosh and several other servicemen is seen by the conservative political and some media as the latest cultural clash between pro-military and anti-war political camps.

While leading his platoon north on Highway I toward Ad Diwaniyah, First Lieutenant Chontosh's platoon moved into a coordinated ambush of mortars, rocket propelled grenades, and automatic weapons fire. With coalition tanks blocking the road ahead, he realized his platoon was caught in a kill zone. He had his driver move the vehicle through a breach along his flank, where he was immediately taken under fire from an entrenched machine gun. Without hesitation, First Lieutenant Chontosh ordered the driver to advance directly at the enemy position enabling his .50 caliber machine gunner to silence the enemy. He then directed his driver into the enemy trench, where he exited his vehicle and began to clear the trench with an M16A2 service rifle and 9 millimeter pistol. His ammunition depleted, First Lieutenant Chontosh, with complete disregard for his safety, twice picked up discarded enemy rifles and continued his ferocious attack. When a Marine following him found an enemy rocket propelled grenade launcher, First Lieutenant Chontosh used it to destroy yet another group of enemy soldiers.

The name Wendouree comes from a local aboriginal word wendaaree which means 'go away': a story is told that when settler William Cross Yuille asked a local indigenous woman what the name of the swamp was, that was her reply. Location and features Lake Wendouree is one of the smallest of a complex of natural wetlands which includes nearby Lake Burrumbeet and Lake Learmonth on the plains of the Central Highlands. The swamp was dammed following the Victorian gold rush in 1851 and since the 1860s it has been a popular recreational lake for Ballarat's citizens. Lake Wendouree now holds significant historical, environmental and recreational values to the Ballarat community. The lake hosted the rowing and canoeing events during the 1956 Olympic Games. During its history, the shallow lake has dried up during drought conditions, the most recent an extended period between 2006 and 2011.  History  Sailing boats on the lake in 1905. In ancient times Lake Wendouree was originally a stream which flowed to the west but a lava flow caused it to be dammed on three sides and it now drains to the east, eventually into the Yarrowee River. The swamp was known to Europeans as \\"Black Swamp\\" due to its dense dark reeds. It was later known as \\"Yuille's Swamp\\" after William Cross Yuille who settled just south of it. When Ballarat was first surveyed in 1851 by W S Urquhart the swamp was recorded as Wendouree and the misunderstood aboriginal word became the official name. Plans to dam the outlet stream that flowed from the swamp began as early as the first surveying and the bank raised and pipes installed and it became the first permanent water supply for the burgeoning gold rush settlement. A corroboree was observed at the Wendouree Swamp in March 1857 by a Ballarat Times reporter. In 1864 a rowing course was first cut through the reedy swamp and the first steamboats arrived. In 1869 a severe drought caused the lake to dry up completely however the water returned the following year and the boats returned. Within a decade it had become the recreational focus of Ballarat, a popular destination and by the 1880s dozens of paddle steamers, ferries, yachts and rowers were using the lake's waters and newly built boat sheds and the establishment of Victorian era gardens around its banks. Lake Wendouree hosted the rowing and canoeing events for the 1956 Summer Olympics.1956 Summer Olympics official report. p. 42. An Olympic monument now marks the end of the course. Apart from private bore water the lake quickly ceased being the city's private water supply with the introduction of new sources including the Gong Gong Reservoir. =2000s drought= Millennium Drought Swimming Is Not Recommended The 2000s Australian drought caused Lake Wendouree to dry up in 2006. Despite warnings by the local council and news publications, local enthusiasts combed below the surface of the dry lake bed for artifacts, including antique glass bottles. The activities of a number of local organisations, including boating clubs, rowing clubs and recreational fishers, had to be suspended, and the dry lake had a large tourism impact on Ballarat. During the summer of 2008-09, fairy grass growing on the dried up lake bed caught fire multiple times.https://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/12/31/2457263.htmhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-22/lake- wendouree-fire-deemed-suspicious/2597208 Better than expected winter rainfall in 2010, as well as storm water and wetland works in 2008 and 2009, saw the lake again reach full capacity in 2011.  Wildlife  Black swans and other birds on Lake Wendouree The reed beds and islands provide sanctuary for a variety of wildlife. Of the recorded 166 species, the most commonly seen waterbirds are black swans, Pacific black ducks, dusky moorhens, purple swamphens, Eurasian coots, musk ducks, great crested grebes, silver gulls and little pied cormorants. Information boards at the Fairyland Wetland Walk provide details about species and habitats. About 100 rakali are scattered around the shore and are sometimes seen in Fairyland at dawn and dusk. The diversity of pondlife is rich and attracts numerous school groups making visits for environmental science field studies.  Transport  A vintage electric tramway operates along the western side of the lake. The volunteers of the Ballarat Tramway Museum have preserved fifteen trams and memorabilia from Ballarat's tramway era. Attracting twenty thousand passengers each year, it is one of Ballarat's most popular tourist attractions. Double-decker horse- drawn trams began carrying visitors to the Ballarat Botanical Gardens in 1887. Paddlesteamers have used the lake in the past for both transport and as a tourist attraction and the most popular one, the Golden City has been restored for return to the lake, and does a tourist circuit each Sunday.http://www.goldencitypaddlesteamer.org.au/ The Begonia Princess paddleboat returned to Lake Wendouree in 2012 after being restored by the current owner and currently and is a popular attraction on the Lake.  Recreation  Boating has long been an important sport and leisure activity on the lake and for many years local schools have held the \\"Head of the Lake\\" rowing regatta there. The track around the lake provides an interesting 6 km challenge to walking, cycling and running enthusiasts who complete the circuit in their thousands each week. For serious athletes, the record for running the 6 km lap of the lake is 16 minutes and 10 seconds, set in 1992 by Marathon Olympian Steve Moneghetti. In recent years, it has been the venue for the annual Goldfields Festival and Springfest extravaganza.

Players take on the roles of major powers‚ÄîGermany, Italy, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States‚Äîfrom 1939 to 1946. The game was popular because of the balance between economics, politics, and land, sea, air and strategic warfare. Players can try alternative strategies (e.g., a German invasion of Spain or the United Kingdom). The game is complex and can take many hours to complete. Revised editions of the game were published in the 1980s. A further redesign of the game, Advanced Third Reich, was published in 1992, followed by a Pacific theater counterpart Empire of the Rising Sun in 1995; in 2003, yet another redesign of these two games was published by GMT Games as A World At War. In 2001, Avalanche Press released a separate new version, more closely resembling the original game, known as John Prados' Third Reich. Gameplay The game normally starts in Fall 1939, although scenarios are provided for starting in 1942 and 1944 (the latter is recommended for learning purposes). Each quarterly turn (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter) represents three months of real time. =Economics= Each major power has a pool of Basic Resource Points (BRPs - sometimes pronounced \\"burps\\"),Gamers' Guide to Third Reich, 1986, pp2-6 to represent economic power, and used to build units, declare war (35 BRPs to declare war on a major power, 10 to declare war on a minor power), or offensives (15 BRPs). The side with more BRPs moves first, so by economising the previous season, a player may gain a \\"flip-flop\\" and make two consecutive moves, possibly allowing a devastating offensive. A Double Turn across winter 1939/40 is common: Germany moves first in Fall 1939, reduces her BRP total by building lots of units, so moves second in Winter, then first again in Spring 1940 as her BRP level refreshes, allowing a spectacular German offensive in the West. Italy's BRPs are included with Germany's even when still neutral, but US and Soviet BRPs are not included until they join the Allies, requiring careful play around the initiative change in the mid-war. The annual Year Start Sequence (\\"YSS\\") begins with strategic warfare in an off-map box. German U-Boats fight Allied Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) factors - ASW become more effective later in the war. Allied bombers, which are not as cheap or effective as U-Boats, fight German interceptors, or German air factors withdrawn from the map. Excess bombers or U-boats eliminate enemy BRPs. After Strategic Warfare each power receives BRPs equal to its economic base, which may increase or decrease by a percentage of the unused BRPs at year-end (the growth rates are 60% for USA, 50% for Germany, 40% for Britain, 30% for the USSR and 20% for Italy - any extra are lost, so saving BRPs to increase the base is not sensible for Italy). Extra BRPs are received for minor countries controlled; a conquered major power (France or Italy after surrender) is treated as a minor worth half her BRP base. Germany, Britain and the USA may then spend up to 10% of their totals on strategic warfare for next year. Each major power's per-turn spending limit is half the total remaining after Strategic Warfare. Britain has a base of 125 BRPs, but as any BRP deficit from Strategic Warfare reduces the base, she often has to set aside half her BRPs to absorb U-Boat losses in mid-war. Germany begins with a base of 150 BRPs, but in mid-war will often have 300 or more BRPs including conquests, and after building all her forces may have enough of a surplus to see her base increase sharply. Countries may transfer BRPs to one another (Italy may give her spare BRPs to Germany for the high growth rate). Allied aid to the USSR, usually sorely needed, must go via Murmansk (the Germans may oppose these transfers with naval, air and U-boat battles in an off-map box), or via Persia (certain to arrive, but taking an extra turn to reach the USSR, with an initial one-off payment need to open up the pipeline). =Land movement and combat= Most counters in the game represent corps, or Soviet armies roughly the size of other countries' corps. In general two counters may stack in a hexagon, or five on a bridgehead (a bridgehead provides unlimited supply for the first post-combat supply phase, and supply may be traced to it in subsequent turns as if it were a port). Only armour units have a Zone of Control, which costs an extra two movement points to pass through (German and US armour have 6 movement points per turn, enabling them to move through two zones of control, other countries' armour units only 5; US armour units, and the two German SS Panzer corps added in 1943, also have 5 strength points rather than the usual 4). British and US infantry have 4 movement points rather than 3, reflecting their higher degree of motorisation. Units remain the same throughout the game, as both sides copied one another's technological advances throughout the war. Combat is completely voluntary. Units are always at least doubled on defence (exception: German units in the first winter after their attack on Russia). Terrain, which has no effect on movement, triples units on defence, while fortresses (Maginot Line, Westwall, Gibraltar, Malta, Leningrad and Sevastopol) quadruple them. Each combat may result in the complete elimination of either side, or an exchange, or a compulsory counterattack, either at face value (i.e. ignoring terrain effects) or at odds dictated by the table. A 2:1 attack is almost certain to succeed (albeit with some risk of an exchange), with only a 1 in 36 chance of an \\"attacker eliminated\\" - the dreaded roll of 4, followed by 6.a roll of 4 at 2:1 odds requires a counterattack at 1:1 odds; a roll of 6 at 1:1 eliminates the defender (i.e. the original attacker in this case) An attack at odds of 3:1 or greater is guaranteed to succeed, the only uncertainty being whether or not the defender will be eliminated outright or inflict some exchange losses. If the defender is eliminated, victorious attacking units may advance after combat into the hex. Provided at least one attacking unit was armour, any other armour unit which did not attack, but which was adjacent to an attacking unit, may now be placed on the newly gained hex (the \\"breakthrough hex\\"). These armoured units may then \\"exploit\\", i.e. move again, provided they keep to a chain with no more than one empty hex between each unit, and then attack - a key tactic in surrounding enemy units. There is no limit to the number of armour units which may stack on or attack from the original breakthrough hex, provided the overstack is rectified by the end of the turn. Breakthrough against an empty enemy-controlled hex is not allowed, but a key position can be attacked by obtaining an overstacked armoured breakthrough against a weakly held hex adjacent to it. An alternative type of combat is \\"attrition\\". The attacker totals the land factors in contact with the enemy (air units play no part). The die roll may require the enemy to lose counters (major countries have replacement units - immobile single-factor infantry units - used to garrison remote areas or to remove to fill attrition losses, apart from the USSR which has many cheap single-factor infantry armies) or hexes - the attacker may not choose a capital, red objective city or bridgehead. The defender may eliminate units from a hex to prevent it being chosen for attrition occupation. There are three fronts (East, West and Mediterranean) on the map; in a multi-player game, attrition may only be selected if all players of one side choose that option for that front - if one player wants to take an offensive, his allies must do the same or else pass (neither movement into enemy-controlled hexes nor combat allowed). =Logistics= Each country has a prescribed \\"forcepool\\", which lists \\"allowable builds\\" as well as forces initially on the map (around a quarter of Germany's forces start the game on the map - for other countries the proportion is much higher). Units built each turn appear at once in the home country (except a rebuilt 9-factor fleet - see below). Infantry costs 1 BRP per factor, armour 2 BRPs per factor, and air, naval and paratroop units 3 BRPs per factor (e.g. 15 BRPs for a whole air unit). In Winter 1941 and the early turns of 1942 the USSR may - for a stiffening in her victory conditions - build some units for free (the \\"Siberian Transfer\\", only half of which may be armour) representing transfer of troops from the Manchurian garrison after Japan goes to war with the USA. Most countries add a few new units to their force pool in 1942. The USSR's forces are initially feeble, but she adds more powerful infantry and armour units in 1942. Germany adds some new armour and infantry units in 1943 and 1944. After construction each country may strategically redeploy a certain number of units. SR is not permitted adjacent to enemy units, so a 3-hex corridor is needed. SR from Britain into the Mediterranean requires either two fleets (via Gibraltar - one of the fleets must be based there) or else 2 SRs and a one-turn delay (via the Cape of Good Hope). The USA also has an Initial Deployment Limit, which restricts how many units may be moved by SR each turn from the USA (shown as a box in the top-left of the map) to its main base in Europe (normally Britain). Germany's SR limit (9), although large, is not enough to cope with war on three fronts from 1944 - rebuilt Hungarian units can take a year to walk back to the Eastern Front - and can be a key factor in her collapse in the late game. Supply may not be traced through zones of control, even if the hexes in question are occupied by friendly units. Unsupplied units cannot move, and are eliminated after the construction phase, and cannot be rebuilt in the same turn in which they are lost (unless the owning player deliberately loses them in poor-odds attacks). =Air warfare= Paratroops do not count for stacking, and negate the effect of rivers, but are lost permanently if not adjacent to a friendly unit when eliminated. They may also drop during armoured exploitation. For the first half of the game the German FallSchirmJaeger Corps is the only paratroop unit on the map. Britain and Italy each add a paratroop corps to their forcepools in 1942 (the USSR adds two slightly weaker ones); the USA also has a paratroop corps in her forcepool. Up to five air factors may base at a city, or at an airbase counter (each major power has three of these, one of which may be placed each turn - once placed it can only be moved by SR or relocated to the country's capital if out of supply). Initially Germany has 6 air units and Italy 2 (i.e. 40 factors), against three British and two French (i.e. 25 factors). By the end of the war 5 German air units (i.e. 25 air factors, assuming some have been transferred to fight Allied bombers) might be facing 5 US, 4 British and 3 Soviet (i.e. 60 air factors). Air units may be voluntarily split up, and single factors may be rebuilt provided they are combined by SR to form a complete air unit. Air units may \\"stage\\" (move between bases up to twice their combat range - during staging or SR they may fly across water up to their combat range) and still be used for combat. Air units may Counterair (attack enemy air at their bases - British air factors in Malta may decline combat but must be inverted if they do so), give Ground Support to attackers (including exploiting armour) or Defensive Air Support. For Ground Support or DAS air factors up to three times the face value of the ground forces may be added; these factors can be removed as part of an exchange, to allow the survival of ground units, or may be eliminated if that side loses the combat altogether. While the attacker may intercept DAS, a numerically superior defender cannot add extra factors to this air battle; a common house rule was to allow the defender to fly \\"escorts\\" to fight off interceptors. In air combat from counterair or interception each side rolls a die, the larger force adding the number of factors by which his force exceeds the smaller. Italy, France and USSR add a Die Roll Modifier of -1 and minor countries -2. The difference in the rolls is the number of factors lost by the defender - the winner loses half as many; in the event of a tie both sides lose factors equal to a third die roll. Used air units are inverted for the rest of the turn. It is sensible to keep air units out of counterair range, especially inverted units which count for zero in combat. Air superiority is vital in offensives, and the cost of rebuilding air factors is a major drain on BRPs. =Naval warfare= Each major power has generic 9-factor fleets: Britain has 10, Italy 5, Germany 4 (2 on the board at the start), France and the USSR 3 each. Four fleets (36 factors) may base at a single port. They may not be voluntarily split up and only whole fleets may be rebuilt (at a cost of 27 BRPs, and with a one-year delay). Fleets may carry supply, may carry ground units for invasions (3 factors to carry each ground factor, i.e. a whole fleet to carry an infantry corps - a beach hex containing a port may not be invaded if a 9-factor fleet is in the hex), may give shore bombardment (3 naval factors count as one ground factor in invasions or attacks on coastal fortresses), may sea transport (carry ground units in the combat phase, 2 factors per ground factor - Germany often transports units into Latvia) or may sea escort (a whole 9-factor fleet to help a single ground unit SR over water). Interception (determined by a die roll) is less likely to succeed over longer distances. Combat is similar to air combat (including similar national DRMs; Germany has a DRM of +2, Britain +1 and Italy -1), with losses multiplied for size in large battles. Unlike air combat no losses are taken in the event of ties, and naval units assisting ground attacks are seldom required to take losses. SR may not be intercepted so naval combat is quite rare. = Miscellaneous = Finland, Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria (Bulgarian units may not enter the USSR) enter the game in 1941 as German minor allies, their troops controlled and paid for by Germany. Their entry may be delayed by Britain or the USSR granting them BRPs as \\"Foreign Aid\\". Turkey activates as a British minor ally in 1945 if not already involved in the war. Other small countries, if attacked, may become \\"Associated Minors\\" (Poland is a British Associated Minor in 1939), whose units may be rebuilt by her patron but which may not move more than one hex beyond their home country. Each player may draw one of ten \\"variants\\". Many of these were minor amendments to the force pools, e.g. extra French armor units instead of the Maginot Line. Two of the German variants were potential game-throwers, allowing Spain (and hence seizure of Gibraltar and transfer of the Italian fleet to the Atlantic, prior to invasion of Britain) or Turkey to join the Axis. The fourth edition diluted the chances of this happening by adding an extra 10 for each side, including \\"Hitler Assassinated\\" (requiring Germany to pass for a turn, with a chunk of her BRPs frozen). Minor countries are conquered at once if their capital is captured. Britain, Italy, Germany and France have a turn to recapture their capital, although only France is allowed only those counterattacks which have at least some chance of success. This prevents French suicide attacks, as half France's remaining forces (including naval factors, which return to Marseilles) form the new pro-German state of Vichy France. The British player rolls separately to determine whether French North Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) and Syria become Vichy French or Free French (some Free French units may join the British force pool). Vichy French units are removed from the game when the Allies deactivate her by die roll. The USSR is not conquered on the loss of Moscow, but may be forced to offer to surrender (see below); if this one-off offer, which still leaves part of the map under Soviet control, is refused then the USSR is eliminated only on the loss of her last unit. The USA cannot be conquered but will end the war at once if all France, Britain and the USSR are conquered (a Soviet surrender does not count as a \\"conquest\\" although American chances in the absence of Britain and France, the USSR having surrendered, would be minimal). French units may not stack with British units - they may commit Ground Support to each other's attacks, as this flies over the German defenders, but not Defensive Air Support - nor may British units enter Paris nor the Maginot Line, but they may conduct joint attacks. France is controlled by the Soviet player if there is no separate French player. Soviet units may not stack or combine with Western Allied units for combat, although the Allies may send a small expeditionary force (of no more than ten factors, i.e. about three corps) to fight in the USSR - this facility was removed from later versions of the game system. Britain and the USA share victory conditions, and their units may always stack and fight together. The Allies may build partisans, forcing Germany to garrison Belgrade and Athens to prevent BRP loss. Partisans may also be built in the USSR or France. A common house rule was to allow partisans in Poland to represent the Warsaw Uprising. In 1939 Germany sets up last of the major powers, and has a free offensive against Poland. The Soviets may then seize \\"Eastern Europe\\" (Eastern Poland, Bessarabia and the Baltic States), which prevents Germany moving in on the Baltic States which would put her forces dangerously close to Leningrad. The Axis player has a free choice as to when Italy enters the war, and up to 10 Italian combat factors (often including an air unit or the two small Italian armored corps) may be \\"lent\\" to participate for free in German offensives. Italy may declare war during the battle of France, allowing Italian air units to be lent to Germany or for German panzer corps to execute (or threaten) a thrust south of the Alps. In the 1981 and subsequent editions Italy may surrender (as in reality) once there are no Axis units in North Africa (Germany may thwart this by a sneaky invasion of Casablanca), and the Allies have the initiative, control Sicily (or both Sardinia and Corsica) and a foothold on the Italian mainland. Control of Italian hexes (other than ones the Allied player has taken control of) passes to the German player, along with the elite Italian Folgore paratroop unit (which can still stack for free but must now fight as ground troops) and a few (determined by a die roll) Italian naval factors. All other Italian units are removed from the game. The USSR may not declare war on Germany prior to 1942, provided Germany maintains a sufficient garrison on the Eastern Front (i.e. Finland, East Prussia and occupied Poland). The USA may declare war on Germany (sic - in reality Hitler declared war on the USA) in Spring 1942. Soviet surrender depends on the size of forces in USSR, although there is a BRP penalty for loss of Moscow and/or Leningrad. Britain suffers a similar penalty for loss of Gibraltar and/or Suez, but surrenders if the Axis capture London. More detailed rules for British surrender (including a provision for some British forces to fight on under US control) were published in the \\"General\\" Magazine Volume 18 Number 5. In a two-player game, Allied victory is determined by how quickly they eliminate the Axis powers, while Germany wins by conquering Britain or the USSR (both for a decisive victory), or can win a marginal victory by controlling 28 objectives in late 1943. In a multi-player game the Western Allies (i.e the USA and Britain jointly) and Soviets separately tally the number of objective cities they control; the French or Italian players \\"win\\" by surviving longer than their real-life counterparts. =Tactics= Third Reich was a favourite at conventions and in Avalon Hill's magazine, The General, with intricate tactics known to experienced players. Paratroops may capture a port, allowing reinforcements to be SRd in, provided another fleet carries supply. Up to three British units may stack in London (in the 4th Edition), to prevent its seizure by German paratroops with massive air support. A double line of defenders blocks armoured exploitation (unless paratroops make a hole in the second line). Paratroops may negate the effect of a river in combat, but a bridgehead, allowing overstacking, may still be placed - useful in taking Warsaw or Paris. Armour, automatically supplied the turn after exploitation (although they may not exploit again unless they can trace supply in the normal way - the same is true of paratroops in the turn after they have dropped) may exploit behind friendly lines to defend against an enemy double-turn. If France places a tank corps in the Maginot Line, Germany must garrison the Rhine with three corps, which otherwise cannot be built in a Zone of Control. Helsinki is not a port so Germany has no way of getting a corps to Finland unless it sets up there. The Germans can take Oslo with paratroops (from an airbase in Denmark) then transfer them to the Hague to threaten both London and Paris; once Norway is conquered, a German 9-factor fleet in Bergen prevents a British invasion. Germany may use air units in the west in 1940 then transfer them to East Prussia as inverted air factors count towards the required garrison. Germany needs to put a replacement in Ploesti to keep the USSR out of Romania before 1941. Partisans can be used to increase an attrition total on a front or to isolate a beach garrison in the Adriatic. Germany may attack the USSR early (e.g. Winter 1940) to get the First Russian Winter out of the way, but the 3rd Edition allowed Russia to defer the effects of the Russian Winter until the following Winter if the initial German foray was weak enough. The Soviets, short of things to do before 1941, may invade Turkey - generally a bad idea as it opens another route of German attack, and if left alone Turkey joins the Western Allies in 1945 anyway. Other suggestions included the \\"crapshoot\\" (a German attack on France in 1939 if the French player has set up carelessly), an Italian invasion of Turkey, a British invasion of Italy in 1939, the \\"Spanish Gambit\\" (a German invasion of Spain to seize Gibraltar, making East European minor countries less likely to join the Germans but possibly allowing the Italian navy to help invade Britain), and the \\"shotgun\\" (a vicious German offensive against the USSR over a double turn). History Rise and Decline of the Third Reich saw four editions, which cleaned up inaccuracies and ambiguities in the units (2nd edition), map (3rd edition), and rules (4th edition). Because some elements were not changed in some editions, the labels did not always match; the 4th edition was labeled on the box as 3rd edition despite having 4th edition rules. At the start of 1986 Avalon Hill published a Gamers Guide to Third Reich. This featured Designers Notes, stressing the game's focus on economics, air and armour (in that order), and mentioning that Prados' original draft had been at division- level with a much larger number of air points, making it an exercise in \\"finger dexterity\\". There were also several strategy articles, many of them written by Marcus Watney and many of which had previously appeared in The General, outlining plans for German attacks on France & Yugoslavia, an Italian attack on Yugoslavia, and British, French and Soviet defences against German attack. There was also a discussion of the game's portrayal of economics, and a draft diplomacy system, a later version of which would be included in Advanced Third Reich. The guide criticised the unrealistic weakness of the late war Soviets in BRPs, air and armour units. Draft rules for British surrender, with some free British forces potentially fighting on from Canada (ie. the US box), were published in The General (Vol 18 No 5). Further draft rule changes by Robert Beyma were also published in that magazine in the mid 1980s, giving the Soviets a few extra air and armour units later in the game, and extra BRPs for control of key cities (several of them in the Urals), and causing the US forcepool to arrive in three annual tranches (1942-4), making a massive landing in France in 1942 as unfeasible as it was in reality. These and other rule changes, including a version of the diplomacy system trailed in the Gamers' Guide, were developed and incorporated into a new version, Advanced Third Reich (1992), designed by Bruce Harper, which also brought together many variants and revised maps. Empire of the Rising Sun (1995), a Pacific theater counterpart to Advanced Third Reich, included rules for aircraft carriers and research (eg. of air ranges, torpedo effectiveness and atomic bombs), as well as rules to combine the games to simulate the whole of World War II around the globe. Avalon Hill's Computer Third Reich was a computer version of the wargame. Computer Gaming World, in 1992, stated that the AI opponent offered a \\"sufficient challenge for beginners\\"; good at finding weak points in opponents but not always good at choosing the right ways to exploit them. The magazine recommended the computer version to those who wanted to learn the game but could not find local opponents, but suggested that experienced players only buy it to play by mail. A combination of Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun, initially designated \\"Global War 2000\\", began development with rules and components posted online, publicly available for anyone who might want to be a playtester and might offer feedback. This was eventually published by GMT Games in 2003, as A World At War. The game's development continues, with updated rules and components available online. At the same time, Avalanche Press was developing a variation known as John Prados' Third Reich. Designed by Brian L. Knipple and published by Avalanche Press, it has distinctly different mechanics from Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, although it is simpler and resembles the original more closely than the GMT version. Reception In the November 1981 edition of Dragon (Issue #55), Tony Watson reviewed the updated third edition game components that had just been released, specifically a new map, new rules and new force-pool cards. He found changes to the map to be minor, but changes to the rules to have a major impact on the game, especially in air and naval combat and strategic warfare.

A related term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military. In the context of the U.S. government, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) has defined \\"COTS\\" as a formal term for commercial items, including services, available in the commercial marketplace that can be bought and used under government contract. For example, Microsoft is a COTS software provider. Goods and construction materials may qualify as COTS but bulk cargo does not. Services associated with the commercial items may also qualify as COTS, including installation services, training services, and cloud services. COTS purchases are alternatives to custom software or one- off developments ‚Äì government-funded developments or otherwise. Although COTS products can be used out of the box, in practice the COTS product must be configured to achieve the needs of the business and integrated to existing organizational systems. Extending the functionality of COTS products via custom development is also an option, however this decision should be carefully considered due to the long term support and maintenance implications. Such customized functionality is not supported by the COTS vendor, so brings its own sets of issues when upgrading the COTS product. The use of COTS has been mandated across many government and business programs, as such products may offer significant savings in procurement, development, and maintenance. Motivations for using COTS components include hopes for reduction system whole of life costs. In the 1990s, many regarded COTS as extremely effective in reducing the time and cost of software development . COTS software came with many not-so-obvious tradeoffs-- a reduction in initial cost and development time over an increase in software component-integration work, dependency on the vendor, security issues and incompatibilities from future changes.McKinney, Dorothy \\"Impact of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software and Technology on Systems Engineering\\", Presentation to INCOSE Chapters, August 2001. Accessed January 28, 2009.  Software and services  Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and services are built and delivered usually from a third party vendor. COTS can be purchased, leased or even licensed to the general public. COTS can be obtained and operated at a lower cost over in-house development , and provide increased reliability and quality over custom-built software as these are developed by specialists within the industry and are validated by various independent organizations, often over an extended period of time. = Security implications = According to the United States Department of Homeland Security, software security is a serious risk of using COTS software. If the COTS software contains severe security vulnerabilities it can introduce significant risk into an organization's software supply chain. The risks are compounded when COTS software is integrated or networked with other software products to create a new composite application or a system of systems. The composite application can inherit risks from its COTS components. The US Department of Homeland Security has sponsored efforts to manage supply chain cyber security issues related to the use of COTS. However, software industry observers such as Gartner and the SANS Institute indicate that supply chain disruption poses a major threat. Gartner predicts that \\"enterprise IT supply chains will be targeted and compromised, forcing changes in the structure of the IT marketplace and how IT will be managed moving forward.\\" Also, the SANS Institute published a survey of 700 IT and security professionals in December 2012 that found that only 14% of companies perform security reviews on every commercial application brought in house, and over half of other companies do not perform security assessments. Instead companies either rely on vendor reputation (25%) and legal liability agreements (14%) or they have no policies for dealing with COTS at all and therefore have limited visibility into the risks introduced into their software supply chain by COTS. =Issues in other industries= In the medical device industry, COTS software can sometimes be identified as SOUP (software of unknown pedigree or software of unknown provenance), i.e., software that has not been developed with a known software development process or methodology, which precludes its use in medical devices. In this industry, faults in software components could become system failures in the device itself if the steps are not taken to ensure fair and safe standards are complied with. The standard IEC 62304:2006 \\"Medical device software ‚Äì Software life cycle processes\\" outlines specific practices to ensure that SOUP components support the safety requirements for the device being developed. In the case where the software components are COTS, DHS best practices for COTS software risk review can be applied. Simply being COTS software does not necessarily imply the lack of a fault history or transparent software development process. For well documented COTS software a distinction as clear SOUP is made, meaning that it may be used in medical devices. Obsolescence A striking example of product obsolescence is the Condor Cluster, a US Air Force supercomputer built out of 1,760 Sony PlayStation 3s running the Linux operating system. Sony disabled the use of Linux on the PS3 in April 2010, leaving no means to procure functioning Linux replacement units.\\"US Air Force gets a migraine from Sony's latest PS3 update\\"( ) In general, COTS product obsolescence can require customized support or development of a replacement system. Such obsolescence problems have led to government-industry partnerships, where various businesses agree to stabilize some product versions for government use and plan some future features, in those product lines, as a joint effort. Hence, some partnerships have led to complaints of favoritism, to avoiding competitive procurement practices, and to claims of the use of sole-source agreements where not actually needed. There is also the danger of pre-purchasing a multi-decade supply of replacement parts (and materials) which would become obsolete within 10 years. All these considerations lead to compare a simple solution (such as \\"paper & pencil\\") to avoid overly complex solutions creating a \\"Rube Goldberg\\" system of creeping featurism, where a simple solution would have sufficed instead. Such comparisons also consider whether a group is creating a make-work system to justify extra funding, rather than providing a low-cost system which meets the basic needs, regardless of the use of COTS products. Applying the lessons of processor obsolescence learned during the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II planned for processor upgrades during development, and switched to the more widely supported C++ programming language. They have also moved from ASICs to FPGAs. This moves more of the avionic design from fixed circuits to software that can be applied to future generations of hardware.\\"F-35 jet fighters to take integrated avionics to a whole new level.\\" Military & Aerospace Electronics, 1 May 2003.

A remake of the 1976 film of the same name, the film stars Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles and Mia Farrow. It was released worldwide on June 6, 2006, by 20th Century Fox. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $119 million against a $25 million budget. Plot Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber), an American diplomat stationed in Italy, is told that his son was stillborn. Unknown to his unconscious wife, Katherine (Julia Stiles), Robert adopts an orphaned newborn at the suggestion of the hospital's chaplain Catholic priest, Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice). Naming him Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), Robert and Katherine raise the boy. Robert's career ascends over the course of the next five years. He is named Deputy Ambassador to the Court of St. James in the United Kingdom. Following the death of the previous ambassador, Robert assumes his position and settles in a large estate just outside London. However, disturbing events begin to occur, including the suicide of Damien's nanny at his birthday party. Robert is approached by Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), who claims to have been involved with events surrounding Damien's birth. Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings (David Thewlis) finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious omens, including premonitions of people's deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow), is hired. Tension rises when Mrs. Baylock starts to make decisions without the consent of the Thorns, including adopting a Rottweiler for Damien's protection. Following an incident near a chapel in which Damien attacks Katherine, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about her son, one of these involving a red-hooded jackal skeleton. When the Thorns visit a zoo, the animals react violently at the sight of Damien. Katherine begins to wonder if there is something wrong with Damien. Father Brennan confronts Robert, telling him that Damien's mother was a jackal, and that the boy is the Antichrist. He explains that Damien must die and a man called Bugenhagen (Michael Gambon), located in Megiddo, can assist. After being rebuked, Father Brennan is killed during a lightning storm. Katherine discovers she is pregnant and is determined to get an abortion, in fear of having a child similar to Damien. Soon afterward, Damien causes an accident in which Katherine is severely injured, resulting in her miscarriage. While recovering in the hospital, Katherine confides in Robert her suspicions that Damien is evil. Robert decides to rendezvous with Jennings and search for Damien's biological mother. The pair discovers the hospital where Damien was delivered has since been demolished after a fire. They travel to Subiaco and meet Father Spiletto, who directs them to a graveyard. There they find the grave of Damien's mother, who is revealed to indeed have been a jackal. In the neighboring tomb, Robert discovers the corpse of his murdered biological son. He and Jennings are attacked by a pack of dogs and barely escape. Mrs. Baylock visits Katherine in the hospital and causes her to have an air embolism, killing her. Learning of Katherine's death, Robert goes to Megiddo, meets Bugenhagen, and receives instructions on how to kill Damien on consecrated ground with seven sacrificial daggers. Bugenhagen tells Robert to examine Damien for a birthmark in the shape of three sixes (\\"666\\"). However, Robert refuses to kill his son, and throws the daggers on the ground. While reaching down to pick up the daggers, Jennings is suddenly decapitated by a falling sign. Robert arrives home and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock's Rottweiler, which he subdues. In Damien's room, he finds the 666 birthmark. Mrs. Baylock attacks Robert, but he fends her off; after running her over with his car, he escapes with a silver Lexus GS. Pursued by the police, Robert flees to a church to kill Damien, but is killed before he can by a Diplomatic Protection officer. As the Pope simultaneously dies, Robert's funeral is attended by the President of the United States, who holds Damien's hand. Damien then looks at the audience and smiles as the credits roll. Cast * Liev Schreiber as Robert Thorn * Julia Stiles as Katherine Thorn * Mia Farrow as Mrs. Willa Baylock * Seamus Davey- Fitzpatrick as Damien Thorn * David Thewlis as Keith Jennings * Pete Postlethwaite as Father Brennan * Michael Gambon as Bugenhagen * Giovanni Lombardo Radice as Father Spiletto * Harvey Spencer Stephens, who portrayed Damien in the original movie, has a cameo role as a reporter Production The film was greenlit in July 2005 with Dan McDermott attached to write and John Moore directing. McDermott would later be denied a credit by the Writers Guild of America as the screenplay was judged to bear too close a resemblance to the original 1976 script by David Seltzer; Seltzer received sole credit despite being uninvolved with the production of the remake. In an episode of the Scriptnotes podcast from April 2015, Craig Mazin called this out as a particularly unique WGA arbitration. Chap Taylor also did some uncredited rewriting According to the feature commentary on the DVD, hosted by Moore, editor Dan Zimmerman and Producer Glenn Williamson, the search for Damien spanned Los Angeles, London and New York. In 2005 newcomer Seamus Davey- Fitzpatrick was cast in the part, with his screen test doubling as the movie's teaser trailer. Principal photography began on October 3, 2005 at lBarrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, where the film was mostly shot. The \\"Jerusalem\\" scenes were filmed in Matera, Italy and some of the London scenes were shot in Herbert Park, Dublin. = Music = The score was composed by Marco Beltrami, using cues from Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score for the original film. Release The film was released on June 6, 2006, at 06:06:06 in the morning (i.e., 2006-06-06 06:06:06). This symbolically represents the number 666, the biblical Number of the Beast. =Box office= The film recorded the highest opening Tuesday box office gross in domestic box office history in the United States for the time, by earning more than US$12 million. It held the record for over a year, until the release of Transformers (2007 film) in July 2007. Fox initially stated that the film earned US$12,633,666 on its first day, but later Bruce Snyder, Fox's president of distribution, admitted that they were \\"having a little fun\\" by manipulating the figure to contain the number of the beast in the last three digits. The film ended grossing US$119,498,909 worldwide, making it a strong success on a budget of US$25 million. It finished as the 59th highest-grossing film of 2006, the 12th highest-grossing R-rated movie of 2006 and the 2nd highest domestic gross of The Omen series when adjusted for inflation. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 26% based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Even with the force of a \\"classic\\" behind it, remake fever can't hold up the hollowness of this style-drenched Omen.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". James Berardinelli commented: \\"On every level, The Omen isn't just bad filmmaking, it's bad storytelling\\". He especially criticised the film's similarity to the original film, which he also greatly disliked. Rolling Stone also made the latter point: \\"Not since Gus Van Sant inexplicably directed a shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock's Psycho has a thriller been copied with so little point or impact\\". Roger Ebert gave the film \\"thumbs up\\" and three stars out of four, in contrast to his negative review of the original, praising John Moore for letting the strong story unfold itself rather than foregrounding visual effects. The Washington Post's Stephen Hunter praised the film: \\"It's handsome in the way it's fast-moving: sleek, well-engineered, full of gooses and honks. Some of the casting seems a little off. Still, it works.\\" Other assessments from critics include: * \\"John Moore's remake can't help but feel a bit stale.\\" ‚Äì BBC film review * \\"This film is for people who've never seen the original, and who are easily scared by mediocre horror films\\"- Eric D.

Further north, it crosses a bridge over South Moreau Creek, and later the Miller‚ÄìMoniteau county line. Within Moniteau County, and well as much of the route, the surroundings are primarily rural and agricultural, and the highway travels along various hills and ridges.

With a few exceptions, the surroundings along Route 87 are primarily residential until the road approaches U.S. Route 50 Bus. Continuing through downtown California, it later it crosses a pair of railroad lines formerly owned by Missouri Pacific Railroad. At Main Street, Route 87 makes a right turn and Oak Street becomes \\"Highway O.\\" It then travels along Main Street for two blocks, then turns north again at East Street. North of Walnut Street, the route curves northeast as it leaves the city limits and becomes Jamestown Road, resuming its run through the rural hills of Moniteau County. It travels through Kliever, and later crosses a bridge over Moniteau Creek. The highway enters Jamestown just as it curves to the west at South Mill Street (Highway AA), then at the intersection with West Row Street joins up in a concurrency with Route 179\\\\. The two highways turn out of town back to the north and later the northwest. After the end of the concurrency with Route 179, Route 87 curves to the west. Between the intersections of two dirt roads, Homestead Road and Splice Creek Drive, it crosses the Moniteau‚ÄìCooper county line and enters Prairie Home. Shortly after the intersection with \\"Highway D,\\" it turns northwest again, gradually curving toward the north after leaving that community and running through rural Cooper County. In Windsor Place, Route 87 encounters an interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70) and is joined by the east end of Interstate 70 Business (BL I-70), with which it has a concurrency towards the northwest, passing by a golf course. Sparse development can be seen along the way, and further northwest the road serves as the western terminus of Route 98, joining part of the Lewis and Clark Trail. Entering Boonville, the highway becomes known as Bingham Road, which has more suburban surroundings. The highway later makes a right turn at \\"Highway B\\" and becomes Main Street. Over two blocks later, the highway is joined by US 40, Route 5, and the Santa Fe Trail, which is where BL I-70 makes a left turn. US 40/Route 5/Route 87 travels north along Main Street through historic downtown Boonville, and after the intersection with High Street, crosses the Boonslick Bridge over the Missouri River, crossing the Cooper‚ÄìHoward county line, entering Franklin. Immediately after crossing the bridge, Route 87 leaves the concurrency with US 40 and Route 5 and turns left, taking the Santa Fe Trail with it. Route 87 and the Santa Fe Trail run in relative proximity to the north bank of the Missouri River crossing the Katy Trail State Park until just before the intersection with Howard County Road 339 (CR 339), and moves further away at the intersection with \\"Highway Z,\\" which continues the previous trajectory towards Petersburg.

These headaches are usually benign, but occasionally are caused by intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral infarction, especially if the pain is sudden and severe. They may be caused by general exertion, sexual excitement, or contraction of the neck and facial muscles. Most cases can be successfully treated with medication. Signs and symptoms According to the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which terms this condition primary headache associated with sexual activity, it normally begins as a dull headache that increases with sexual excitement, and becomes intense at orgasm. For some patients, the headache begins suddenly, often at orgasm. In two thirds of cases, it is bilateral, and unilateral in the rest. The pain lasts from one minute to 24 hours with severe intensity, or as long as 72 hours with mild intensity. Its occurrence is unpredictable, and may not follow every sexual act. Previous editions of the ICHD divided the condition into two subforms, preorgasmic headache and orgasmic headache. These subforms were merged into one entity with varying presentation because clinical studies could not distinguish them. Post-orgasmic headaches associated with posture may be better attributed to a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak. Sudden, severe headaches during sexual activity may also be caused by intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or cerebral infarction, which require immediate medical attention. Causes For some patients, the headaches may be related to general exertion. About 40% of patients with sexual headaches in one study also experienced headaches from non-sexual exertion. A pressor response to exercise has been suggested as a mechanism. For other patients, the pain appears to be specifically activated by sexual excitement and contraction of facial and neck muscles. Sporadic case studies have linked sexual headaches to the use of certain drugs, including amiodarone, pseudoephedrine, birth control pills, and cannabis. It may be secondary to another condition, such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. It is associated with migraines. Treatment A physician may recommend engaging in sexual activity less strenuously. Case series have found indomethacin and beta blockers to be successful in treating these headaches. Propranolol, Bellergal, and triptans have also been used with success. Anecdotal and indirect evidence suggests a trial of magnesium supplementation may improve symptoms (in subjects with known or suspected low Mg levels). Epidemiology These headaches are estimated to appear in roughly 1% of the population. They can occur with sexual activity at any age. It is more common in men than women, with studies putting the gender ratio between 1.2:1 and 3:1.

Career  Vander Wende's career began at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), working on projects such as the films Willow and Innerspace as a concept designer. Because of a fondness for the old Disney films, Vander Wende took a position at Walt Disney Feature Animation. His early visual development for Aladdin led directors Ron Clements and John Musker to choose that story as the subject for their next film. Vander Wende eventually became production designer for the film. Following his stint at Disney, Vander Wende became interested in the potential of computer games as a medium for telling a different kind of story. After a chance meeting with Robyn Miller, he began working at Cyan (currently, Cyan Worlds) and eventually became co-director and co-designer of the computer game Riven; the sequel to Myst. His more cinematic visual influence is clearly seen throughout the Riven world. His wife Kate had a cameo appearance in the game as Leira/Keta. After the successful launch of Riven, Vander Wende left Cyan to pursue other projects.

The proposed State has been defined in multiple ways, but can generally be said to be coterminous with the region known as the Inland Northwest. The proposed state was named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, who was president during the American Civil War. His name was also proposed for the states that were eventually named North Dakota and Wyoming. Lincoln in the Northwest The State of Lincoln has been proposed to consist of the Panhandle of Idaho and Eastern Washington (that is, east of the Cascade Mountains). Other than Lincoln, the names \\"Columbia\\" and \\"Eastern (or East) Washington\\" were proposed to be used for the state. It was first proposed by Idaho in 1865, when the capital was moved from Lewiston in December 1864 to its present-day location of Boise in January 1865, in an Idaho greatly reduced in land area. The original Idaho Territory, from a bill signed by President Lincoln in March 1863, was declared by Governor William H. Wallace in Lewiston, July 4, 1863, and included present-day Idaho, and virtually all of present-day Montana and Wyoming, making it larger in land area than Texas. Montana was made a territory in May 1864 and the Panhandle was specifically excluded in order to prevent Lewiston, west of both the Continental Divide along the crest of the Rockies and of the Bitterroot Range, from remaining the capital. The reasoning was that Lewiston sits on the western edge, across the Snake River from Washington. Montana stretches to North Dakota. In the mid and late 1860s, there was a proposal centered on Lewiston in northern Idaho for a Columbia Territory to be formed in the Inland Northwest from parts of what is now eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana.Merle W. Wells. \\"Territorial Government in the Inland Empire: The Movement to Create Columbia Territory, 1864-69.\\" The Pacific Northwest Quarterly. Vol. 44, No. 2 (April 1953), pp. 80-87. In 1901 another proposal was made, this time to combine the Idaho Panhandle with Eastern Washington to create the state of Lincoln. A third proposal was popularized in the late 1920s to consist of eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana to the Continental Divide. From the Washington end, proposals have been made as recently as 1996, 1999 and 2005. Idaho saw a corresponding campaign for North Idaho, financed by the sale of T-shirts reading \\"North Idaho ‚Äì A State of Mind\\". Areas proposed for inclusion =Northern Idaho= While the disconnection between Western Washington and Eastern Washington is well known and documented, Northern Idaho has a similar dynamic in which its residents often feel disconnected from the state's political center in Boise. The Idaho Panhandle is most often considered to be the ten northernmost counties in the state‚ÄîBoundary, Bonner, Benewah, Clearwater, Idaho, Kootenai, Latah, Lewis, Nez Perce, and Shoshone. These counties are separated from Southern Idaho by the Salmon River and observe Pacific Time, unlike the rest of the state, which uses Mountain Time. Parallel suggestions of a \\"State of Kootenai\\" have been made, referring to a proposed union of the six northernmost counties of Idaho, and the six westernmost counties of Montana, creating a geographically, politically, and ecologically connected state of 524,888 residents, putting it ahead of other states such as Wyoming. =Eastern Washington and eastern Oregon= Other conceptions of a potential \\"State of Lincoln\\" have been rendered, specifically a possible combination of eastern Washington and eastern Oregon. The people of Eastern Oregon also often express the same frustration with being coupled with Portland and the region west of the Cascades that Eastern Washingtonians do with respect to Seattle. This proposed coupling would create one of the largest states by area in the country, stretching all the way from the eastern foothills of the Cascade Mountain Range to the border with Idaho in the east. Proposals The state legislatures for Idaho and Washington have seen bills proposing secession or splintering. Idaho would not go along at the time as the Panhandle generated more tax revenue per capita than the south. If combined with the proposed State of Jefferson, which overlaps a proposed Oregon-Washington \\"State of Lincoln\\" in southeastern Oregon and is proposed for many of the same reasons, it would create a state that is even larger. The Inland Empire region roughly corresponds to the area that might comprise such a State of Lincoln. The largest city would be Spokane, Washington, which is presently Washington's second largest and the greater Spokane area is the third largest population base in the northwestern US behind Seattle and Portland. A Spokane proposal in 1907 called for a new state \\"Lincoln\\" to be created from eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, and northern Idaho. Oregon and Washington's eastern boundary would have been shifted westward to 120¬∞ W, aligning with California's eastern boundary. Idaho's northern boundary would have been shifted southward to 45¬∞ N, aligning with Wyoming's northern boundary. Alternative name for current states =North Dakota= It was proposed to split Dakota Territory into northern and southern halves while being considered for statehood in the 1880s. Republicans in the Senate suggested the name \\"Lincoln\\" for the northern half, despite objections from residents from the territory, which drew strong objection from the Democrats. Ultimately the territory was admitted in 1889 as two states, North Dakota and South Dakota. =Wyoming= When the 1868 bill to form Wyoming Territory was first discussed in the U.S. Senate, an amendment was proposed that would have changed its name to Lincoln Territory after the assassinated U.S. president Abraham Lincoln. The new name was supported by the Senate Committee on Territories, however it started a debate that scrutinized both \\"Lincoln\\" and \\"Wyoming\\", with several members preferring local and Indian names. Multiple senators objected to naming a territory after a single man, acknowledging Washington Territory (named in 1853 for George Washington) as the sole exception. \\"Wyoming\\" was the simple English transliteration of the Lenape Indian tribe's word for \\"large plains\\",Urbanek, Mae. Wyoming Place Names. Missoula, Montana: Mountain Press Publishing Company, 1988. which was considered descriptive of the land but undesirable due to its distant origin in Pennsylvania. The bill eventually passed both houses of Congress with the name \\"Wyoming Territory\\", and the Wyoming name was retained when statehood was achieved in 1890.

Frederick Small (born 1965), better known as Daddy Freddy, is a Jamaican ragga vocalist. Early life Small was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and grew up in the city's Trenchtown district.Huey, Steve \\"Daddy Freddy Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2011-02-14 His house was a few minutes walk from Coxsone Dodd's influential record studio Studio One. His neighbours were Jacob Miller and Ranking Joe. Ranking Joe took Freddy under his wing and taught him the basics skills of performing. Freddy's natural ability meant he was quickly enlisted to work with Lt. Stichie (of \\"Natty Dread\\" fame) and then later with Sugar Minott. It was performing on Minott's soundsystem that founded Freddy's fame in Jamaica. He recorded his first single (\\"Zoo Party\\") in 1985 for Studio One. Gaining fame He released his first album, Body Lasher, in 1986, and that year had six top ten hits in Jamaica, including a number one with \\"Joker Lover\\", a collaboration with Pinchers. After successful touring in the US under the Chrysalis record label, Freddy came to England in 1987. His first UK work was a collaboration with Asher D called, Raggamuffin Hip-Hop. This album created a new style of music that was a fusion of Jamaican ragga and UK hip- hop. The anthemic title track has the much sampled vocal, \\"The ragga-muffin, the ragga-muffin, hip-hop\\". Freddy also managed to influence and support fledgling UK reggae stars, Top Cat, Tenor Fly and Prento Youth who went on to the legendary Coxsone Sound and the record label Congo Natty. This album created even more interest for Freddy. Artists such as Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, David Morales and Norman Cook all requested collaborations and others like The Prodigy, Meli'sa Morgan (\\"Through the Tears\\"), Salt 'n' Pepa and KRS-One all sampled his unique voice. This fame culminated in Freddy attempting and breaking the World Record for World's fastest rapper in 1989 as part of the Capital radio Music Festival. Eventually Freddy broke the record four times taking it from 346 to 598 syllables a minute. First and second time in UK (in Covent Garden and on BBC's Record Breakers show where he appeared with Roy Castle) and two times in America (New York Empire State Building and in Washington). Renowned live performances have always been Freddy's hallmark, most notably at the New Music Seminar in New York and Tim Westwoods live rap shows on Capital radio. He was signed to Chrysalis Records in 1991 by A&R; VP Duff Marlowe, joining Gang Starr and Arrested Development as part of Marlowe's stateside re-make of the UK rock label, releasing the album Stress. Career break By the end of the 1990s Freddy was exhausted. His hectic life-style had taken it out of him so he found time to return to Jamaica and re-discover his roots. Whilst he still lent vocals to prominent dancehall tracks in Jamaica his next major work did not come until he came back to the UK, with a new lease of life. Freddy teamed up with renowned dub producer The Rootsman in 2000 to make the new album, Old School ‚Äì New School (Third Eye Music). Since then Freddy has been making new music and recording and training dancehall artists.\\"Rumble Music remakes dancehall classic\\" Jamaica Star. Retrieved 2018-05-31.

Geography It is located in the north of the Community of Madrid, in Spain, in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. The municipality has an elongated shape that goes from Northwest to Southeast, and the majority of it is protected inside the Parque Regional de la Cuenca Alta del Manzanares. It borders with Manzanares el Real on the West, Miraflores de la Sierra on the East, Colmenar Viejo on the South, and Rascafr√≠a on the North. Soto del Real encompasses a variety of terrains: mountain tops, slopes, and the Manzanares-Guadalix tectonic pit. The urban nucleus is inside the pit, going through the Mediano, Chozas and Matarrubias streams, which flow into the Santillana reservoir, so they are tributaries of the Manzanares river. Geologically speaking, it is divided into the Mountain range, where there is a predominance of Gneiss with granite outcrops, and the pit formed by a tertiary sedimentary fill. Furthermore, in the South area there is limestone from the Mesozoic era. History The first evidence of settlements in Soto del Real dates from the 10th century, with archeological remains of houses and ceramics attributed to shepherds. During the 13th century, the area encompassing Colmenar Viejo, Chozas de la Sierra and Porquerizas (Miraflores de la Sierra) was a source of legal conflict between the provinces of Madrid and Segovia, with John I of Castile incorporating Chozas to the municipality of El Real de Manzanres in 1389. In 1568 Philip II of Spain exempted Chozas from El Real de Manzanares. The name Soto del Real has been in use since a 1959 vote in which the local population chose the name over Alameda de la Sierra or its historic one, Chozas de la Sierra. The town's coat of arms makes reference to both of the town's names. Soto makes reference to the numerous trees and forests surrounding (in Spanish Sotos), del Real referring to its historical ties to El Real de Manzanares from 1389 till 1568. Festivities The first weekend of August Soto del Real celebrates its festivities in honour of the Virgen del Rosario (Our Lady of the Rosary), patron of the municipality. The 7 October, day of the Virgin of the Rosary, is also celebrated, as is 15 May, day of San Isidro External links * Municipal website * Soto del Real Forum-Foro de Soto del Real * Municipal news website Category:Municipalities in the Community of Madrid ","title":"Soto del Real"},{"id":"2425387","title":"The Mummy (TV series)"},{"id":"2425388","text":"Rudston Monolith, almost high, close to Rudston Parish Church of All Saints. It is made from Moor Grit Conglomerate from the Late Neolithic Period, a material that can be found in the Cleveland Hills inland from Whitby. Bosville Arms Rudston is a small village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is situated between Driffield and Bridlington approximately west of Bridlington, and lies on the B1253 road. The Gypsey Race (an intermittent stream) runs through the village, which lies in the Great Wold Valley. There are a number of Neolithic sites associated with the stream and its valley. It is the current Seat of the Clan Macdonald of Sleat. According to the 2011 UK census, Rudston parish had a population of 409, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 390. From the medieval era until the 19th century Rudston was part of Dickering Wapentake. Between 1894 and 1974 Rudston was a part of the Bridlington Rural District, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. From 1974 it was part of the Borough of North Wolds (later Borough of East Yorkshire), in the county of Humberside until the East Riding was re- established in 1996.  History  The place-name 'Rudston' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, and means 'rood' or 'cross' stone, referring to the monolith. However, the name 'rud' derives from Old Norse ru√∞, meaning a clearing or pasture. So the place name could be stone in the clearing, Ru√∞stane.  Ancient remains  The Rudston Monolith stands in the parish churchyard. At over tall, it is the tallest standing stone in England, and gave the village its name; it is Grade I listed. Southside Mount round barrow is situated to the south west of the village close to Woldgate reservoir. Rudston is the centre of an unparalleled grouping of four Neolithic cursus monuments: cursus A, cursus B, cursus C and cursus D. At least one end of each cursus rests on an elevated chalk ridge on the sides of the Great Wold Valley. Cursuses A and C cross the Gypsey Race, whilst the other ends of cursuses B and D probably lie under the village. Rudston Roman villa, noted for its mosaics, was first excavated in 1839. It was subsequently re-excavated in the 1930s, 1960s and 1970s. The mosaics are now in the Hull and East Riding Museum.  Parish church  Rudston Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints. Of 14th-century origin, it was restored in 1861 by George Fowler Jones. It contains the gigantic organ, originally of four manuals, given by Sir Alexander McDonald of the Isles. Now a 3 manual instrument, it stands at the west end of the church in the original case. The author Winifred Holtby was born in Rudston and is buried in the church graveyard. Since September 2014, the North Aisle of the church has a small heritage area including a 3D map of the village with sites of interest noted and a set of information boards about the history of the village. Thorpe Hall to the east of the village was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1952 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. William Bosville (d.1813) was the last of his family to own it, and he bequeathed it to his nephew Godfrey Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald of Slate (1775‚Äì1832), whose descendants own it today.

The most popular myth of Tala is that she is one of the three daughters of Bathala to a mortal woman. Her sisters include Mayari, the goddess of the moon and Hanan, the goddess of morning. She is known to have supported the creation of the Tagalog traditional constellations. Tala used light spheres or orbs to ferry men to safety at night, however, when the Spaniards came, they demonized the light orbs and called it santelmos in a bid to convert the natives into Christianity. The natives eventually regarded the orbs as deadly beings that kill men or get humans to lose their way. In another, more modern story,Hill, Percy. A. (1934). Philippine Short Stories, p65.

They both agreed to destroy their stars. While Arao devoured his, Buan hid hers in the clouds, where they would occasionally emerge. Upon seeing this, Arao was filled with rage and is eternally in pursuit of Buan, trying to destroy her. Eclipses are explained by Arao getting close enough to bite her. At dawn, Buan hides the stars and brings them forth only when her eldest daughter, Tala (the evening and morning star) says the sun is too far away to pursue them.

It was founded by political analyst Charlie Cook in 1984. Coverage of Senate and Gubernatorial races is headed up by Editor Jessica Taylor and coverage of House races is led by David Wasserman. Amy Walter serves as national editor. Reports include Charlie Cook's two weekly columns for National Journal magazine, and NationalJournal Daily. In addition, changes are generally made each week to the House, Senate, and Governors At-A-Glance charts, which list every candidate running in each state and district in the country, in addition to other candidates who are rumored to be considering a run. The House Summary lists the current makeup of the House of Representatives, as well as all announced retirements, potential retirements, and candidates possibly running for higher office. All House and Senate contests are rated, regardless of competitiveness on a seven-point scale; Solid Democrat, Likely Democrat, Lean Democrat, Toss-Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican, and Solid Republican. The Cook Political Report employs what it calls the Cook Partisan Voting Index (the PVI), which lists each congressional district in the country according to propensity for voting Democratic or Republican. Every four years following a presidential election, the PVI is updated to reflect how Democratic or Republican a district is, based on how that district voted in the presidential election compared with the rest of the country. Previously a hard copy publication, the Cook Political Report moved to an all online format in 2004.

Career Rainich studied mathematics from 1904 to 1908 in Odessa, in G√∂ttingen (1905‚Äì1906), and in Munich (1906‚Äì1907), eventually obtaining his doctorate (Magister of Pure Mathematics) in 1913 from the University of Kazan. After teaching at the University of Kazan, in 1922 (via Istanbul), he emigrated with his wife to the United States. After three years at Johns Hopkins University, he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan, where he remained until his retirement in 1956. After his retirement as professor emeritus, he was in 1957 at Brown University as a member of the editorial staff of Mathematical Reviews and he was for several years a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame. After the death of his wife in 1963, he returned to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and organized there a seminar on general relativity theory for physicists and mathematicians. Rainich's research centered on general relativity and early work toward a unified field theory. In 1924, Rainich found a set of equivalent conditions for a Lorentzian manifold to admit an interpretation as an exact non-null electrovacuum solution in general relativity; these are now known as the Rainich conditions. According to some sources, Peter Gabriel Bergmann brought Rainich's suggestion that algebraic topology (and knot theory in particular) should play a role in physics to the attention of John Archibald Wheeler, which shortly led to the Ph.D. thesis of Charles W. Misner. Another version of this tale replaces Bergmann with Hugh Everett, who was a fellow student of Misner at the time. ICM 1932. According to the Editor of The American Mathematical Monthly, Rainich is the inventor of the Rabinowitsch trick, a clever argument to deduce the Hilbert Nullstellensatz from an easier special case. It is later explained that Rainich was born Rabinowitsch, hence the Pseudonym. Rainich, as Georg Rabinowitsch, proved new results on Euler's prime-generating polynomial. Rainich was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1928 at Bologna (with talk On a Spacetime possessing the symmetry properties of radiation) and in 1932 at Z√ºrich. He also gave a talk (concerning his results on the Euler prime- generating polynomial) at the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge, England. From 1933 to 1936 he was a member of the Council (advising the Board of Trustees) of the American Mathematical Society. Rainich's private papers are held at the University of Texas. Personal life In 1917 he married Sophie Kramkowsky. In 1930 he brought his mother from the Soviet Union to Ann Arbor, where she remained until her death in 1953. Upon his death he was survived by a daughter, two grandchildren, and a brother, Dr. Michael Rabinovich of Moscow.Memorial for George Yuri Rainich by K. B.

Its French name translates to \\"Great/Large Meadow\\" and the community lies at the eastern edge of the Annapolis Valley several kilometres east of the town of Wolfville on a peninsula jutting into the Minas Basin surrounded by extensive dyked farm fields, framed by the Gaspereau and Cornwallis Rivers. The community was made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem Evangeline and is today home to the Grand-Pr√© National Historic Site. On June 30, 2012, the Landscape of Grand-Pr√© was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1404 UNESCO World Heritage Sites entry for Grand-Pr√©  History  Grand-Pr√© was founded in about 1680 by Pierre Melanson and Pierre Terriot. Pierre Melanson, an Acadian settler who traveled east from Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons's original settlement at Port Royal (see Annapolis Royal and the Habitation). Pierre, an Acadian of French Huguenot and English extraction, had arrived in Port Royal with Sir Thomas Temple in the 1650s when Acadia was under English control.Edm√© Rameau de Saint-P√®re. Une Colonie F√©odale en Am√©rique (L'Acadie, 1604-1610). Paris, Librairie Plan, 1889. Pierre Terriot was the son of Jehan born in Port Royale around 1654. Pierre Melanson was responsible for founding the parish of Saint-Charles des Mines while his friend, Pierre Terriot founded the parish of Saint-Joseph de la rivi√®re aux Canards. The fertility of the soils and wealth of other resources in the area had been known to the French since the early part of the century when Samuel de Champlain, de Mont's cartographer, had surveyed the region. The settlers quickly employed their dyke building technology to the vast salt marshes; effectively reclaiming several thousand acres of productive farm land. The farms and the population grew quickly, making Grand-Pr√© the principal settlement in Acadia. Settlements spread from Grand-Pr√© around the Minas Basin, collectively becoming known as Les Mines or Minas after the copper deposits surveyed by de Mons at the entrance to the Basin. By the mid-1680s the population was sufficient to support a church and the parish of Saint-Charles des Mines was formed.Stephen Bujold.

In this raid, Church and his rangers got stuck on the mud flats of Baie Francais (Bay of Fundy), which gave the Mi'kmaq and Acadians time to position themselves to fiercely defend the village. They were eventually overwhelmed and Church burned the village and the fields. = King George's War =  Battle of Grand-Pr√© (1747)  During King George's War, a French force led by Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay defeated a larger British force in a night raid at the Battle of Grand-Pr√©. This battle was the most significant and bloodiest victory for the French in Acadia. The village, however, remained in British control once the French retreated. = Father Le Loutre's War = Father Le Loutre  Acadian Exodus (1749-1755)  During Father Le Loutre's War, the Acadians at Grand-Pr√© played a significant role in supporting the Acadian Exodus out of mainland Nova Scotia, which started in 1749. Grand-Pr√© willingly responded to the call from Le Loutre for basic food stuffs. The bread basket of the region, they raised wheat and other grains, produced flour in no fewer than eleven mills, and sustained herds of several thousand head of cattle, sheep and hogs. Regular cattle droves made their way over a road from Cobequid to Tatamagouche for the supply of Fort Beaus√©jour, Louisbourg, and settlements on √éle St. Jean (Prince Edward Island). Other exports went by sea from Minas Basin to Isthmus of Chignecto or to the mouth of the Saint John River, carried in Acadian vessels by Acadian middlemen.Patterson, in John Ried. (ed)Atlantic Canada Before Confederation. 1994, p. 141 The Acadians from Grand-Pr√© also offered their labour to those at Isthmus of Chignecto to build a church and dykes.  Siege of Grand-Pr√© (1749)  The British built Fort Vieux Logis in the area during Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War, which was attacked by the Acadians and Mi'kmaq in the Siege of Grand-Pr√©. The siege lasted for a week and the 300 natives took prisoners who remained in captivity for almost two years. Eventually the Mi'kmaq retreated. = French and Indian War =  Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755)  Acadian Memorial Cross, Grand-Pr√© During the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War), the Acadians were expelled from Grand-Pr√© during the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). There were various British soldiers who kept a journal of the deportation from Grand-Pr√© such as Lt. Col. John Winslow and Jeremiah Bancroft. The site of Grand-Pr√© during the expulsion was later immortalized by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow with his epic poem Evangeline. Acadians from Grand Pr√© were dispersed in many locations and some eventually returned to other parts of the Canadian Maritimes such as Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick. Many Acadians expelled from the Grand-Pr√© area eventually settled in the New England States and travelling overland to South Louisiana in the United States after being dropped on the Atlantic coast. In Louisiana, the term Cajun evolved from the name Acadian.  New England Planters  After the deportation of the Acadians, the vacant lands were resettled by New England Planters in 1760 and renamed Horton Township. A large town plot with a rectilinear street grid was laid between Grand-Pr√© and Horton Landing to the east, but the local farming population preferred to settle along the upland ridge in a spread out fashion, much like the previous residents of the area, the Acadians, had done. Several schools and congregations were formed at Grand-Pr√© including a meeting house converted into a church in the early 19th century, today known as the Covenanter Church. Over time, merchants and shop owners congregated at nearby Wolfville to the west, leaving Grand-Pr√© to continue as a farming community. One of the Planter descendants was Sir Robert Borden, the eighth Prime Minister of Canada, who was born in Grand-Pr√© in 1854. Grand-Pr√© continued as a rich and productive but small farming community. The Windsor and Annapolis Railway arrived in 1869, at first serving the community with a small rural station. Livestock and marsh hay became major exports, joined in the late 19th century by the Annapolis Valley's major apple exporting industry. Four large apple warehouses were built around the station to pack and ship apples. In the 1920s when the Dominion Atlantic Railway developed the Grand-Pr√© Memorial Park to attract tourists.\\"Grand-Pr√©\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Initiative While agriculture remained Grand-Pr√©'s major industry, the park made the community a tourism destination as well as a memorial to the Acadian people. The Park eventually became a National Historic Site and in 1957 was purchased by the Canadian Park Service.  Today  Unveiling of Evangeline (1920) by famed Quebec sculptor Louis-Philippe H√©bert, completed posthumously by his son Henry Today, Grand- Pr√© is the home the Grand-Pr√© National Historic Site which is now a national park administered by Parks Canada to commemorate the Acadian people and their deportation. The Covenanter Church at Grand-Pr√© is the oldest existing Presbyterian church in Nova Scotia.http://www.htns.ca/quarterly/articles/church.html One of Nova Scotia's best known wineries, Domaine de Grand-Pr√©, is located in the community. Grand- Pr√© is also Canada's first designated Historic Rural District. The Just Us! coffee company headquarters is located in the village and is something of a tourist attraction. Evangeline Beach is a famous stopover for thousands of migrating shore birds and is also a fine vantage point for watching the ebb and flow of the world's highest tides.  Demographics  Grand-Pr√© in 1750 Grand-Pr√© has no official status; there are only specific data for subdivision D of Kings County, which includes the area between Hantsport and Wolfville, where Grand-Pr√© and a few other villages exist. In this area, there were 5499 inhabitants in 2006, compared to 5167 in 2001, an increase of 6.4%. The average age is 44.5, compared to 41.8 for the province. 84.8% of the population is older than 15 years, which is in the provincial average. Statistique Canada - Profils des communaut√©s de 2006 - Kings, Subd. D With regard to language, 96.6% of the inhabitants are English-speaking, 1.4% are francophone and 2.0% are allophones. The francophone population is anglicized as 99.3% of the population speak English at home. With respect to knowledge of official languages, 7.2% of the population can communicate in French at various levels, the rest being unilingual anglophone.

From 1828 he was Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music at the court of Sultan Mahmud II (1808‚Äì39). His younger brother was the famous opera composer Gaetano Donizetti. He studied music first with his uncle, Carini Donizetti, and, later, he was a pupil of Simone Mayr. After enlisting in Napoleon's army (1808), he served there as band leader. He took part in the campaigns against Austria and in Spain, and followed Napoleon to Elba. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo. After the fall of Napoleon, he continued his career as a bandmaster in the Savoy army. Giuseppe Donizetti Pasha, as he was called in the Ottoman Empire, played a significant role in the introduction of European music to the Ottoman military. Apart from overseeing the training of the European-style military bands of Mahmud‚Äôs modern army, he taught music at the palace to the members of the Ottoman royal family, the princes and the ladies of the harem, is believed to have composed the first national anthem of the Ottoman Empire, supported the annual Italian opera season in Pera, organised concerts and operatic performances at court, and played host to a number of eminent virtuosi who visited Istanbul at the time, such as Franz Liszt, Parish Alvars and Leopold de Meyer. Although the elder Donizetti was born in Bergamo, Italy, Constantinople became a second home for him, and he lived there until his death in 1856. He is buried in the vaults of the St. Esprit Cathedral, near the Beyoƒülu district of Istanbul, in Pera.

The school opened in 1956, and educates approximately 2,173 students in grades 9‚Äì12. It is one of eighteen schools of the East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD). It is named after Californian painter and preservationist Andrew P. Hill.  Demographics  As of 2012, Andrew Hill High's demographics is close to that of Yerba Buena High School's, and is roughly 60% Mexican American, 30% Asian American, 3.0% Filipino American, 2.9% White, 2.3% African American and 1.4% other (Native American and Pacific Islander). As of the 2011-2012 school year, Andrew Hill High School had a 73.4% graduation rate amongst its senior class. This number is up from the 2010-2011 graduation rate of 72.7%, but still a two-year low from the 2009-2010 graduation rate of 78.3%. Of these students, 30.6% who graduated, or 131 of 585 of the senior class students, graduated having met the requirements to admission to the University of California and/or California State University campuses. In 2007, 45% of the school's students qualified for the free lunch program, compared to the district average of 25%. In 2010, 55% of the school's students qualified for the federally subsidized lunches, the best measure of the percentage of low-income students at each school. Andrew Hill receives Title I low income funding under the No Child Left Behind Act.  History  There was a movement to make the school a charter school. However, this push was rejected by district trustees, though the effort continued. If the effort succeeded, Andrew Hill would have become the largest charter school in Northern California.  Curriculum  Advanced Placement (AP) courses are offered at Andrew Hill. As of 2011, 33% of students participated in at least one AP course and/or exam. The average number of tests per students taking the AP exams was 2.4. The school has the Medical MAGNET program for students to begin in grade 10 until graduation, designed to further educate participating high school students with a focus on medicine, and involves science classes and education in medical literature. The Biotech Academy is also available, and is coordinated by Paul Moradkhan. It is a California Partnership Academy (CPA), similar to the MAGNET programs, designed for participating high school students as a career focused education in the field of biotechnology. Students are enrolled in the academy from grade 10 through 12. =IB= The International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme has been offered at Andrew Hill since February 2003. Students may take the entire Diploma Programme, or single IB courses stand alone for certificates, only during grades 11 and 12. The current IB Programme coordinator at the school is Michael Winsatt. In the 2012‚Äì2013 school year, Andrew Hill students took IB courses at both the higher and standard levels in English, mathematics, music, Spanish, theatre and visual arts, only at the higher level in history, and only at the standard level in chemistry, biology, French, physics, sports science and Vietnamese.

The U.S. entrance is south of Porter and Vermont streets near Rosa Parks Boulevard. The Canadian entrance is south of Wyandotte Street West between Cameron and Wellington Avenues. It was built by the Detroit River Tunnel Company for the Canada Southern Railway, leased by the Michigan Central Railroad and owned by the New York Central Railroad. The tunnel opened in 1910 and is still in use today by the Canadian Pacific Railway. On the Detroit side, the area around the tunnel is off limits to the general public and is routinely patrolled by officers and agents of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Canadian Pacific Police Service, CN Police, Detroit Police Department, and the security elements of the bridge company. History Postcard, early 1900s Postcard, 1911 Prior to the construction of the tunnel, the Canada Southern Railway had several connections to Michigan at its west end, all train ferries. The northern one ran across the St. Clair River, connecting to the St. Clair and Western Railroad. The southern connection crossed the Detroit River south of Detroit, connecting to the Canada Southern Bridge Company at Grosse Ile. Additionally a branch (usually considered the main line) split from the line to Grosse Ile at Essex, running to the Detroit River at Windsor. In 1891, the Grand Trunk Railway opened the St. Clair Tunnel at Port Huron, giving it an advantage over the Canada Southern and its car ferries. The Detroit River Tunnel Company was formed August 15, 1905, as a merger of the Michigan and Canada Bridge and Tunnel Company (in Michigan) and the Canada and Michigan Bridge and Tunnel Company (in Ontario). Construction began in October 1906 under the engineering supervision of The New York Central Railway's engineering vice president, William J. Wilgus. The Michigan Central Railway Tunnel opened for passenger service July 26, 1910. Freight service began September 15 and on October 16 all traffic began running via the tunnel, ending the use of a train car ferry. From opening it was operated by the Michigan Central Railroad under lease of December 19, 1906. It was the first immersed tube tunnel to carry traffic. On the east (Canadian) side, the tunnel connected to the line that had served a train ferry at Windsor. On the west (U.S.) side, the tunnel connected to the Michigan Central Railroad main line west of downtown (later abandoned east of the junction), and the Michigan Central Station was built west of the junction, opening in 1913. In 1968, the tunnel passed from the New York Central Railroad to Penn Central, and in 1976 to Conrail. In 1985, Conrail sold the tunnel to the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, with each getting a half share.Trackside Guide No. 3 - Detroit, Trains, June 2003 In early 2000, CN agreed to sell its stake to Borealis Transportation Infrastructure Trust (a venture of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System) and use only the St. Clair Tunnel. CP and Borealis vested the tunnel into the new Detroit River Tunnel Partnership, and plans were announced to construct a new railway tunnel and convert the existing railway tunnel to a two-lane free flow truckway for transport trucks to alleviate pressure at the other nearby international border crossings (Ambassador Bridge, Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, and the Detroit-Windsor Truck Ferry). In June 2009, CP announced the sale part of its interest in the Partnership, so that now Borealis holds 83.5% and CP holds 16.5%. The north tube underwent a $27 million enlargement in 1993. That expansion enabled the north tube to accept some modern stacked container rail cars and auto carriers, which used to move by car ferry across the Detroit River. The tunnel cannot accommodate the largest stacked rail cars, such as 9-foot-6-inch \\"high- cube\\" shipping containers that are stacked.Shea, Bill - Ford's Michigan Central Station office workers will still see and hear hundreds of thousands of train cars. Crain's Detroit Business. June 24, 2018 In 2010, The Windsor Port Authority, Borealis Infrastructure, and Canadian Pacific announced plans to construct a new rail tunnel compatible with double stacked trains. The initiative is known as the Continental Rail Gateway. The project was scrapped in 2015, upon the approval of the proposed Gordie Howe International Bridge.

(; 25 October 1885 OS ‚Äì 11 August 1942) was a Russian physician and one of the first female psychoanalysts. She was in succession the patient, then student, then colleague of Carl Gustav Jung, with whom she had an intimate relationship during 1908‚Äì1910, as is documented in their correspondence from the time and her diaries.Lance S. Owens, Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus (Gnosis Archive Books, 2015), 27-35. (Online edition available.) She also met, corresponded, and had a collegial relationship with Sigmund Freud. She worked with and psychoanalysed Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget. She worked as a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, teacher and paediatrician in Switzerland and Russia. In a thirty-year professional career, she published over 35 papers in three languages (German, French and Russian), covering psychoanalysis, developmental psychology, psycholinguistics and educational psychology. Among her works in the field of psychoanalysis is the essay titled \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\\", written in German in 1912. Spielrein was a pioneer of psychoanalysis and one of the first to introduce the concept of the death instinct. She was one of the first psychoanalysts to conduct a case study on schizophrenia and have a dissertation appear in psychoanalytic journal. Spielrein is increasingly recognized as an important and innovative thinker who was marginalized in history because of her unusual eclecticism, refusal to join factions, feminist approach to psychology, and her death in the Holocaust. Family and early life 1885‚Äì1904 Sabina Spielrein as child (left), with her mother and sister. She was born in 1885 into a wealthy Jewish family in Rostov-on-Don, Russian Empire. Her mother Eva (born Khave) Lublinskaya was the daughter and granddaughter of rabbis from Yekaterinoslav. Eva trained as a dentist, but did not practise. Sabina's father Nikolai (born Naftul) Spielrein was an agronomist. After moving from Warsaw to Rostov, he became a successful merchant. On her birth certificate, Sabina appeared as Sheyve Naftulovna, but throughout her life and on official documents she used the name Sabina Nikolayevna. She was the eldest of five children. All three of her brothers later became eminent scientists. One of them, Isaac Spielrein, was a Soviet psychologist, a pioneer of work psychology. From her early childhood, Sabina was highly imaginative and believed that she had a 'higher calling' to achieve greatness, and she communicated about this privately with a 'guardian spirit'. However, her parents' marriage was turbulent and she experienced physical violence from both of them. She suffered from multiple somatic symptoms and obsessions. Some commentators believe she may have been sexually abused by someone in the family. She attended a Froebel school followed by the Yekaterinskaya Gymnasium in Rostov, where she excelled in science, music and languages. She learned to speak three languages fluently. During her teens, she continued to be troubled emotionally and became infatuated first with her history teacher, then with a paternal uncle. While at school, she resolved to go abroad to train as a doctor, with the approval of her rabbinic grandfather. At the end of her schooling she was awarded a gold medal. Hospital admission 1904‚Äì05 Following the sudden death of her only sister Emilia from typhoid, Spielrein's mental health started to deteriorate, and at the age of 18 she suffered a breakdown with severe hysteria including tics, grimaces, and uncontrollable laughing and crying. After an unsuccessful stay in a Swiss sanatorium, where she developed another infatuation with one of the doctors, she was admitted to the Burgh√∂lzli mental hospital near Zurich in August 1904. Its director was Eugen Bleuler, who ran it as a therapeutic community with social activities for the patients including gardening, drama and scientific lectures. One of Bleuler's assistants was Carl Jung, afterwards appointed as deputy director. In the days following her admission, Spielrein disclosed to Jung that her father had often beaten her, and that she was troubled by masochistic fantasies of being beaten. Bleuler ensured that she was separated from her family, later requiring her father and brothers to have no contact with her. She made a rapid recovery, and by October was able to apply for medical school and to start assisting Jung with word association tests in his laboratory. Between October and January, Jung carried out word association tests on her, and also used some rudimentary psychoanalytic techniques. Later, he referred to her twice in letters to Freud as his first analytic case, although in his publications he referred to two later patients in these terms. During her admission, Spielrein fell in love with Jung. By her own choice, she continued as a resident in the hospital from January to June 1905, although she was no longer receiving treatment. She worked as an intern alongside other Russian students there including Max Eitingon, as well as expatriate psychiatrists who were studying with Bleuler, including Karl Abraham. Medical student 1905‚Äì1911 She attended medical school at the University of Zurich from June 1905 to January 1911, excelling there academically. Her diaries show a very broad range of interests and reading including philosophy, religion, Russian literature and evolutionary biology. She lived in a number of different apartments, mixing in a social circle that included mainly fellow Russian Jewish women medical students. Many of these, together with Spielrein, became fascinated with the emerging movement of psychoanalysis in western Europe, and studied with Bleuler and Jung. Spielrein's main focus while in medical school was on psychiatry. A number of them, like Spielrein, subsequently became psychiatrists, spent time with Freud in Vienna, and published in psychoanalytic journals. These included Esther Aptekman, Fanya Chalevsky, Sheina Grebelskaya and Tatiana Rosenthal. Politically, Spielrein identified with socialism, although some of her Russian student contemporaries were followers of the Socialist Revolutionary Party or of Zionism. Spielrein completed her medical school dissertation, supervised first by Bleuler then by Jung, on a close study of the language of a patient with schizophrenia. It was published in the Jahrbuch f√ºr psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which Jung edited. She was one of the first people to conduct a case study on schizophrenia and have it published in a psychoanalytic journal. Freud referenced it in the same volume in his postscript to the Schreber Case;S. Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 220 It was the first doctorate ever to appear in a psychoanalytic journal, and one of the first psychoanalytic case studies of schizophrenia. Her dissertation contributed greatly to the understanding of the language of people with schizophrenia. Because her study was one of the first to focus on schizophrenia, the need for more research began and led to more people focusing on the mental illness. It was also the first dissertation written by a woman that was psychoanalytically oriented.Hall, Karen. Sabina Spielrein 1885-1942 Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia, 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. Accessed 1 May 2015 She left Zurich the day after her graduation, having resolved to establish an independent career as a psychoanalyst elsewhere. Relationship with Carl Jung While at medical school, Spielrein continued to assist Jung in the laboratory as she had done as an in-patient. She also attended his ward rounds and met him socially. The strong feelings she had developed towards him as his hospital patient continued during her first three years at medical school, and she developed a fantasy of having a child between them to be called Siegfried. She did not have any further therapy from him, although from around late 1907 he informally tried to analyze her wish for his child. In the summer of 1908, as she entered her fourth year at medical school, she and Jung began to have increasingly intimate encounters, which she described in her diaries as \\"poetry\\". There are differing views as to whether or not they had sexual intercourse. John Launer has reviewed the evidence from her diaries and their letters in his 2015 biography of Spielrein, Sex Versus Survival. The Life and Ideas of Sabina Spielrein. He has concluded that they had consensual and erotic physical contact but stopped short of sexual penetration. This is supported by Spielrein's statement in a letter to her mother: \\"So far we have stayed at the level of poetry that is not dangerous.\\" Lance Owens has further summarized the documentary evidence in his 2015 study, Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus,Owens, Lance S., Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus (Gnosis Archive Books, 2015), 27-35. (Online edition available. This work was originally published in Das Rote Buch ‚Äì C. G. Jungs Reise zum anderen Pol der Welt, ed. Thomas Arzt, Verlag K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 2015. Zvi Lothane, a Freudian psychoanalyst and scholar of psychoanalytic history, makes the most robust and well-supported case against a consummated sexual relationship between the pair. Lothane summarizes his conclusions: > People tend to believe as dictated by their own emotions, projections, and > transferences. ... Our judgment should really be guided by what the > protagonists never tired of asserting themselves: that there was no sex. In > the final analysis the question is whether we believe their testimony or > not. I choose to believe them, and not out of prudery, but because in those > days people saw premarital sexual relations, especially as applies to > Spielrein, differently than we do today; moreover, because unconsummated > sexual desire was even more poignant and more romantic than consummated sex. > However, the sexual myth dies hard, providing sensational material for a > number of theatrical productions and a plethora of articles in the popular > press and professional journals.Zvi Lothane, ‚ÄúTender love and transference: > Unpublished letters of C.

For an extended review of the > evolution of the relationship between Spielrein and Jung, see, Owens, Lance > S., Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus, 27-35. (Online edition > available.) During the ensuing months, Jung wrote to Freud about the relationship, at first accusing Spielrein of having tried unsuccessfully to seduce him, and then admitting that he had become romantically involved with her. He sent a series of letters to Spielrein's mother, writing \\"no one can prevent two friends from doing as they wish...the likelihood is that something more may enter the relationship\\". Spielrein also wrote to Freud, making it clear that, for a few months, their relationship had been in some fashion physical, it had involved what Spielrein again called \\"poetry\\": \\"In the end the unavoidable happened...it reached the point where he could no longer stand it and wanted 'poetry'. I could not and did not want to resist, for many reasons' Eva Spielrein threatened to report him to Eugen Bleuler and came to Zurich to do so, but in the end decided not to. Meanwhile, Jung had resigned his medical post at the Burgh√∂lzli, although he continued his laboratory work and university teaching. A document-based account of these events, including the three-way correspondence among Spielrein, Jung and Freud, appears in Launer's biography. After a hiatus of several months, caused by the above controversy, Spielrein and Jung resumed their relationship in the summer of 1909, and continued seeing each other privately up through the last months of 1910. Spielrein permanently departed Zurich around January 1911.Owens, Lance, Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus, 29. In Spielrein's private diary entry dated 11 September 1910‚Äîjust four months before graduating from medical school, and leaving both Jung and Z√ºrich‚Äîshe mused again upon her fantasy of bearing Jung‚Äôs son. Sabina saw in reality how totally impossible it was, how it would ruin her chance of finding another love and destroy her scientific and professional ambitions: > With a baby I would be accepted nowhere. And that would be in the best of > cases; what if I did not even get pregnant? Then our pure friendship would > be destroyed by the intimate relationship, and our friendship is what is so > terribly dear to me.Carotenuto, Aldo, A Secret Symmetry: Sabina Spielrein > Between Jung and Freud, (Pantheon Books, 1982), 13. This personal diary entry from late-1910 strongly suggests that Spielrein realized that even if they were to finally have sexual relations, she might not get pregnant. And having taken that step, ‚Äúour pure friendship would be destroyed by the intimate relationship....‚Äù Written shortly before her departure from Z√ºrich, those words seemingly imply that whatever the nature of their physical \\"poetry\\", Jung and Spielrein had not engaged in sexual intercourse.Owens, Lance S., Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus, 31. Some commentators have seen Jung's conduct as a professional boundary violation, while others have seen it as an unintended and forgivable consequence of early experimentation with psychoanalytic techniques. The historian and Freudian psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim commented on her treatment and the apparently beneficial result, noting that, \\"However questionable Jung's behaviour was from a moral point of view...somehow it met the prime obligation of the therapist towards his patient: to cure her‚Äù. By contrast, Peter Loewenberg (among others) has argued that it was in breach of professional ethics, and that it \\"jeopardized his position at the Burgh√∂lzli and led to his rupture with Bleuler and his departure from the University of Zurich\\". At the time, Freud was tolerant of what happened between Jung and Spielrein, and regarded it as an example of countertransference. Later, he confessed to Spielrein that it had played a part in the schism between him and Jung: \\"His behavior was too bad. My opinion changed a great deal from the time I received that first letter from you\\". The relationship between Jung and Spielrein demonstrated to Freud that a therapist's emotions and humanity could not be kept out of the psychoanalytic relationship. Jung had come to the same conclusion.Jung wrote about this extensively in subsequent years; see Owens, Lance, Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus, 16-25. Before this episode, Freud apparently believed that a doctor could numb his emotions when analyzing patients. When Jung came to Freud about his relationship with Spielrein, Freud changed his ideas about the relationship between doctor and patient.Citation needed Spielrein seems to have regarded her experiences with Jung as overall more beneficial than otherwise. She continued to yearn for him for several years afterwards, and wrote to Freud that she found it harder to forgive Jung for leaving the psychoanalytic movement than for \\"that business with me\\". Spielrein sometimes is regarded as having been the inspiration for Jung's conception of the anima, in part due to a reference Jung made 50 years later in Memories, Dreams, Reflections‚Äîthe biographical memoir compiled and edited by Aniela Jaff√©‚Äîto an imaginatively encountered interior feminine voice that awakened his awareness of the interior anima. He recounted, it was \\"the voice of a patient ... who had a strong transference to me\\". This interpretation of Spielrein as the voice of Jung's anima is found in, Kerr, John, A Most Dangerous Method, 502-7. However, in the unpublished transcript of Jung's comments recorded by Aniela Jaff√© in 1957, Jung made it clear this woman was Maria Moltzer and not Spielrein.Carl G. Jung Protocols, Library of Congress; this is also documented in, Sonu Shamdasani, Cult Fictions: C.G. Jung and the Founding of Analytical Psychology (London: Routledge, 1998), 16, 57ff. Nonetheless, Lance Owens has documented that the relationship with Spielrein was indeed crucial to Jung's evolving understanding of what he much later termed the anima.Owens, Lance S., Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus, 27ff. Career 1912‚Äì1920 including \\"Destruction\\" paper Memorial plaque at former residence of Sabina Spielrein in Berlin, Germany After graduation, Spielrien moved to Munich to study art history, while also working on a paper on the connection between sex and death. In October she moved to Vienna, where she was elected a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. She was the second female member of this society. She delivered her paper to the Society on 27 November as \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming into Being\\", publishing an amended version the following year in the Jahrbuch. The paper shows evidence of both Jungian and Freudian thought, but appears to mark the point at which she moved from identifying herself with Jung to seeing herself as more of a Freudian.F. McLynn, Carl Gustav Jung (1996) p. 192-7. Freud explicitly mentioned her paper in a famous footnote to Beyond the Pleasure Principle, acknowledging that it started the train of thought which led him to conceptualize the death drive: \\"A considerable part of this speculation has been anticipated in [her] work\\". Spielrein's concept, however, was different from Freud's, in that she saw destructiveness as serving the reproductive instinct rather than one in its own right. Spielrein met with Freud on a number of occasions in 1912, and continued to correspond with him until 1923. She attempted in her correspondence with both Freud and Jung to reconcile the two men. In the \\"Destruction\\" paper, and throughout her subsequent career, she drew on ideas from many different disciplines and schools of thought. By age 26, Spielrien became the youngest to publish her works. In 1912 Spielrein married the Russian Jewish physician Pavel Nahumovitch Sheftel. They moved to Berlin, where Spielrein worked alongside Karl Abraham. Spielrein had her first daughter Irma-Renata (known as Renata), in 1913. While in Berlin, Spielrein published nine further papers. One of these was an account of children's beliefs about sex and reproduction, in which she included recollections of her own early fantasies about this. Entitled 'Contribution to the Understanding of a Child's Soul', it shows her in more Freudian mode than her previous papers.F. McLynn, Carl Gustav Jung (1996) p. 192 In another paper, entitled, ‚ÄòThe Mother-in-Law‚Äô, she gave a sympathetic account of the role of mothers-in- law and the relationship between them, their daughters-in-law. The Dutch psychoanalyst van Waning has commented on this paper: ‚ÄùWomen‚Äôs studies ‚Äì in the year 1913!‚Äù. Another paper from the time recounts her treatment of a child with a phobia of animals, and is one of the first known reports of child psychotherapy At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Switzerland, living briefly in Zurich again before relocating to Lausanne, where she and Renate remained for the rest of the war. Her husband joined his regiment in Kiev, and they were not reunited for more than a decade. The war years were times of privation for Spielrein: she did some work as a surgeon and in an eye clinic, but also received contributions from her parents when they could get these to her. She did however manage to publish two more short papers during the war years. She composed music, and considered becoming a composer. She also began to write a novel in French. She recorded observations of her daughter's development in terms of language and play. She continued her correspondence with Freud and Jung and her development of her own theoretical ideas, particularly in relation to attachment in children.  Career in Geneva 1920‚Äì23 and work with Jean Piaget  In 1920 she attended the sixth congress of the International Psychoanalytical Association in The Hague, where she gave a talk on the origins of language in childhood. The audience included Sigmund Freud, his daughter Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Sandor Ferenczi. She also announced her intention to join the staff of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva, a pioneering clinical, training and research centre for child development in Geneva. She remained there for three years, working alongside its founder √âdouard Clapar√®de, as well as other distinguished psychologists of the time including Pierre Bovet. While she was there, Jean Piaget also joined the staff: they collaborated closely, and in 1921 he went into an eight-month analysis with her. In 1922, she and Piaget both delivered papers at the seventh congress of the International Psychoanalytical Association in Berlin. This was one of the most productive periods of her life, and she published twenty papers between 1920 and 1923. The most important of these was a new version of the paper she had given at the Hague on the origins of language, drawing on her collaboration with the linguist Charles Bally. Entitled \\"The origins of the words 'Papa' and 'Mama'\\", she described how language develops on a substrate of genetic readiness, first through interactions between the child and the mother's breast, and then through family and social interactions. Her other papers from the time are mainly devoted to bring psychoanalytic thought together with observational studies of child development,. Her papers in the Zeitschrift and Imago from this time mainly focus on the importance of speech acquisition in early childhood and the sense of time. However, Otto Fenichel singled out for special mention her 1923 article on voyeurism, where ‚ÄúSabina Spielrein described a peeping perversion in which the patient tried to overcome an early repression of genital and manual erotogeneity, provoked by an intense castration fear‚Äù.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 348 Overall, her work during this period is thought to have had considerable influence on Piaget's thought, and possibly on Klein's. In 1923, discouraged by her lack of success in building up a private practice in Geneva, and with Freud's support, she decided to travel to Moscow to support the development of psychoanalysis there. She planned to return to Geneva, and left her personal papers, including all her diaries and correspondence, in the basement of the Rousseau Institute. In the event, she never returned to western Europe, and the papers remained undiscovered until they were identified nearly sixty years later by the Jungian analyst Aldo Carotenuto, who published a selection of them. The archive remains in the possession of the heirs of √âdouard Clapar√®de, and although further selections have been published in a number of books and journals, it has never been fully examined or catalogued. Russian career 1923‚Äì1942 Psychoanalysis in Russia already had a turbulent history but its influence was strongest between 1921 and 1923. On her arrival in Moscow, she found herself the most experienced psychoanalyst there, as well as one of the most closely connected with analysts and psychologists in the west. She was appointed to a chair in child psychology at First Moscow University, and took up work in pedology (children study), an approach to pediatrics that integrated it with developmental and educational psychology. She also joined the Moscow Psychoanalytic Institute, which had been founded in 1922 under the direction of Moise (Moishe) Wulff. She then became involved with an ambitious new project in children's learning known as the \\"Detski Dom\\" Psychoanalytic Orphanage‚ÄìLaboratory (also known as the \\"White House.\\") Memorial plaque on the house where Sabina Spielrein lived at 83 Pushkin St, Rostov-on-Don. The sign says: \\"In this house lived the famous student of C. G. Jung and S. Freud, psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein (1885‚Äì1942)\\" Founded in 1921 by Vera Schmidt (who had also been one of Freud's students), the \\"Detski Dom\\" was intended to teach children based on Freud's theories. The school was only an orphanage in name: along with Schmidt's own son, the school had children from prominent Bolsheviks (including Joseph Stalin, whose son Vasily Stalin was enrolled as well).

Sexual exploration and curiosity was also permitted. Spielrein's involvement included supervision of the teachers, and she may have supported them in a protest about their poor conditions of work, which led to their dismissal. The school had to close in 1924, in the wake of accusations of experiments to stimulate the children's sexuality prematurely. The accusations were possibly made in response to attempts by Leon Trotsky to proletarianize the school's intake During Spielrein's time in Moscow, both Alexander Luria and Lev Vygotsky came to work at the Psychoanalytic Institute and \\"Dyetski Dom\\" and studied with her. Spielrein's characteristic way of combining subjective psychological ideas from psychoanalysis with objective observational research of children is likely to have been an important influence in their early formation as researchers, leading them to become the foremost Russian psychologists of their time. In late 1924 or 1925, Spielrein left Moscow. She and her daughter rejoined her husband Pavel in Rostov-on-Don. As well as probably being disillusioned by her experience in Moscow, Spielrein may have been impelled to return because her husband by now was in a relationship with a Ukrainian woman, Olga Snetkova (born Aksyuk), and they now had a daughter, Nina. Pavel returned to his wife, and their second daughter Eva was born in 1926. For at least the next decade, Spielrein continued to work actively as a pediatrician, carrying out further research, lecturing on psychoanalysis, and publishing in the west until 1931. In 1929 she presented a vigorous defense of Freud and psychoanalysis at a congress of psychiatry and neuropathology in Rostov, possibly the last person to mount such a defense at a time when psychoanalysis was on the point of being proscribed in Russia. The paper also made it clear that she was up-to-date with developments in the west, and included sympathetic comments on the approach of Sandor Ferenczi, who was advocating a more emotional engaged role on the part of the therapist. She also talked of the importance of clinical supervision for psychological work with children, and described an approach to short term therapy that could be used when resources did not allow for extensive treatment. Her niece Menikha described her from the 1930s as \\"a very well mannered, friendly and gentle person. At the same time, she was tough as far as her convictions were concerned.\\" Her husband died in 1936. In 1937 her brothers Isaac, Jan and Emil Spielrein were arrested, and executed in 1937 and 1938 during the Great Purge. Spielrein came to an agreement with Pavel's former partner, Olga Snetkova, that if either of them died, the surviving woman would care for their three daughters. Death Spielrein and her daughters survived the first German invasion of Rostov-on-Don in November 1941, which was repelled by the Red Army. However, in July 1942, the German army reoccupied the city. Spielrein and her two daughters, aged 29 and 16, were shot dead1995 testimony by her friend https://namesfs.yadvashem.org/YADVASHEM/23031614_240_5513/178.jpg by an SS death squad, Einsatzgruppe D, in Zmievskaya Balka, or \\"Snake Ravine\\" near Rostov-on-Don, together with 27,000 mostly Jewish victims. Although most of the members of the Spielrein family were killed in the Holocaust, the wives and children of her brothers all survived, and there are currently around 14 of their descendants living in Russia, Canada, the United States and Israel.Yad Vashem testimony by her cousin living in Israel https://namesfs.yadvashem.org/YADVASHEM/NEW_APP/20160302_1155_340_9056/26185.jpg Legacy Despite her closeness to the central figures of both psychoanalysis and developmental psychology in the first part of the twentieth century, Spielrein was more or less forgotten in Western Europe after her departure for Moscow in 1923. Her tragic death in the Holocaust compounded this erasure. The publication in 1974, of the correspondence between Freud and Jung, followed by the discovery of her personal papers and publication of some of them in the 1980s onwards, made her name quite widely known. However, it led to her identification in popular culture as an erotic sideshow in the lives of the two men. Within the world of psychoanalysis, Spielrein is usually given no more than a footnote, for her conception of the sexual drive as containing both an instinct of destruction and an instinct of transformation, hence anticipating both Freud's \\"death drive\\" and Jung's views on \\"transformation\\";Bettelheim, Bruno (1983) \\"A Secret Symmetry\\" in Freud's Vienna and Other Essays. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Regardless of the questionable relationship with Jung, something positive and very useful to psychotherapy was born from it. Jung's correspondence to Freud about his relationship with Spielrein inspired Freud's concepts of transference and countertransference. In recent years, however, Spielrein has been increasingly recognized as a significant thinker in her own right, influencing not only Jung, Freud and Melanie Klein, but also later psychologists including Jean Piaget, Alexander Luria and Lev Vygotsky Spielrein also has influential work in several topics such as: gender roles, love, the importance of intuition in women, the unconscious, dream interpretation, sexuality and sexual urges, libido, sublimation, transference, linguistics and language development in children. Etkind's research in Russia in the 1990s showed that she did not \\"disappear\\" after leaving Western Europe, but continued as an active clinician and researcher. The publication in 2003 of a selection of essays about her under the title Sabina Spielrein, Forgotten Pioneer of Psychoanalysis stimulate interest in her as an original thinker. The first scholarly biography of her in German, by Sabine Richeb√§cher placed her relationship with Jung in its proper context of a lifelong career of involvement with psychoanalysis and psychology. Lance Owens suggests that the importance of Spielrein's relationship with Jung should not be historically discounted, but seen as an additional part of her legacy and broad creative influence. Owens provides evidence that Spielrein played a seminal role in Jung's personal psychological development, his understanding of love, and his subsequent formation of core psychological conceptualizations about \\"anima\\" and \\"transference.\\"Owens, Lance S., Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus\\". Followers of feminist and relational psychoanalysis are also beginning to claim her as an important progenitor. A milestone in reclaiming Spielrein as an original thinker was reached during the 2015 congress of the American Psychoanalytic Association, when the opening plenary lecture was given by Dr Adrienne Harris, on \\"The clinical and theoretical contributions of Sabina Spielrein\\", crediting her with pioneering relational psychoanalysis. Through the works of Sabina Spielrein's child analysis, she was able to differentiate between autistic languages and social languages. She differentiated between (primary) autistic languages and social languages (like song, words, etc.) and developed an exciting theory in the context of child development explaining the meaning of a mother's breast and sucking/nursing. The Memorial Museum Sabina Shpilereyn was opened in the house in which she lived in Rostov in November 2015.–í –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–µ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–ª—Å—è –º—É–∑–µ–π —É—á–µ–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –§—Ä–µ–π–¥–∞ –∏ –ª—é–±–æ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –Æ–Ω–≥–∞ –°–∞–±–∏–Ω—ã –®–ø–∏–ª—å—Ä–µ–π–Ω John Launer's 2015 biography of Spielrein (in English, and written with the support of the Spielrein family) is based on close readings of her hospital notes, diaries and correspondence. It calls into question many of the received accounts about Spielrein. He challenges the presumption that Jung psychoanalyzed Spielrien in any systematic way, reciprocated her feelings for long, saw her as his 'anima', or regarded her as a more significant figure than his other female partners of the time. Instead, Launer sees her historical importance as someone who made an early attempt to harmonize psychoanalysis and developmental psychology within an overarching biological framework, anticipating modern ideas from attachment theory and evolutionary psychology. An English language biography of Spielrein by Angela M. Sells, entitled Sabina Spielrein: The Woman and the Myth, was published by SUNY Press in August 2017. Popular culture * A documentary, Ich hie√ü Sabina Spielrein (My Name Was Sabina Spielrein), was made in 2002 by the Hungarian-born Swedish director Elisabeth Marton and was released in the United States in late 2005. The documentary was released in the U.S. by Facets Video, a subsidiary of Facets Multi-Media. * A 2002 biopic The Soul Keeper (Prendimi l‚ÄôAnima), directed by Roberto Faenza, with Emilia Fox as Spielrein and Iain Glen as Carl Gustav Jung. * Spielrein figures prominently in two contemporary British plays: Sabina (1998) by Snoo Wilson and The Talking Cure (2003) by Christopher Hampton (based on John Kerr's book A Most Dangerous Method) in which Ralph Fiennes played Jung, and Jodhi May played Spielrein. Both plays were preceded by the Off Broadway production of Sabina (1996) by Willy Holtzman. * Hampton adapted his own play for a feature film called A Dangerous Method (2011), produced by Jeremy Thomas, directed by David Cronenberg, and starring Keira Knightley as Spielrein, Michael Fassbender as Jung and Viggo Mortensen as Freud.

Developed by EA Sports and Budcat Creations and published by Electronic Arts, it was released for PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube on September 19, 2002, then for PlayStation 2 on September 29 and for Microsoft Windows on October 16. The product features Dale Earnhardt, Jr. on the cover. It was the first time the NASCAR's Most Popular Driver Award recipient was featured on the cover, although he did not win the award for the first time until the following year. Dale Earnhardt appeared in the game as a driver as a result of entering his name as a Create-A-Car driver's name; he did not appear in the previous game due to his death. He appeared as a legend in subsequent games. Gameplay Being a racing simulation, NASCAR Thunder 2003 places the player in control of a stock car in a NASCAR race. Players battle AI drivers for race position for a preset number of laps. As the race progresses, players are forced to make a pit stop to refuel, replace tires and repair damage. For multiplayer support, NASCAR Thunder 2003 becomes split- screen and eliminates much of the field. Normally featuring the NASCAR number of 43 drivers in a race, it is limited to 18 or fewer with more than one human driver. As an option, the AI drivers can be disabled, allowing the players to just race each other. There are two modes available for players. Quick Race simply allows up to four players to participate on any track and race with a specified number of settings. After the race ends, the game returns to the main menu. Career Mode is the most involving mode of the game. Returning from NASCAR Thunder 2002, it places the player in control of a custom NASCAR Winston Cup Series driver, who must manage pit crew, sponsorship and research and development for 20 seasons. Although Season Mode, like Career Mode, allows the player to play through 20 seasons, it is essentially the Quick Race mode with season standings. Unlike career mode, which starts the player with inferior equipment and pit crew, they are equal to the AI's from the start. Players have a choice to play as either existing or custom drivers, and the settings are completely customizable, unlike the limited options in Career Mode. To achieve multiplayer compatibility, it not only decreases the number of AI drivers in a race while also randomizing them, meaning only a handful of drivers end up participating in the entire season. However, like in Quick Race, they can be disabled for a 2‚Äì4 player competition. Thunder License is the time attack mode of the game; basically a tutorial and time trial of how to race across the included tracks. Lightning Challenges are playable re- enactments of Winston Cup races from 1999, 2000, 2001, and the 1st part of 2002. These challenges are played on all three difficulty levels. The drivers tell the players about what happened to them in the race. The player then has the chance to re-enact or alter history according to the particular scenario's requirement. Release A month after the console versions' release, a PC version of NASCAR Thunder 2003 was made available, becoming the second PC game in the series. However, despite its later release, it removes all special modes (and the entire Thunder Plate system) except for Season mode. A new testing mode is added, and 16-player multiplayer over the Internet or LAN is supported. It generally received lower scores from reviewers than the console version did. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms except the PC version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The Register, published in Anaheim, is owned by Digital First Media. Freedom Communications owned the newspaper from 1935 to 2016. History The Register was founded by a consortium as the Santa Ana Daily Register in 1905. It was sold to J.P. Baumgartner in 1906 and to J. Frank Burke in 1927. In 1935 it was bought by Raymond C. Hoiles, who renamed it the Santa Ana Register. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hoiles was one of the few newspaper publishers in the country to oppose the forced relocation of Japanese and Japanese-Americans to camps away from the West Coast. Hoiles reorganized his holdings as Freedom Newspapers, Inc. In 1950, the name was changed to Freedom Communications. The paper dropped \\"Santa Ana\\" from its title in 1952. In 1956, the newspaper was a prominent supporter of a vociferous campaign by anti-communists against the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act, claiming that it was part of a Communist plot to establish concentration camps in Alaska. Circulation rose with the burgeoning population of Orange County and after the Register added a morning edition in 1959. In 1970 Hoiles' sons, Clarence and Harry, became co-publishers until 1979, when R. David Threshie, Clarence's son-in-law, was named to the position. =1980s= Faced with an aggressive push into the county by the Los Angeles Times under then-publisher Otis Chandler, Threshie brought in 30-year-old N. Christian Anderson III as editor. Political positions were restricted to the editorial page. In 1981, the paper began publishing in full color. In 1985, the paper assumed the name The Orange County Register. In the same year it won its first Pulitzer Prize, for its photographic coverage of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. It won additional Pulitzers in 1989 for beat reporting by Edward Humes on U.S. military problems with night-vision goggles and in 1996 for an investigation into Ricardo Asch's fertility clinics.Graham, Harry L., Stop the Damned Presses!, pp. 183‚Äì86, Words & Pictures Press, Clear- water, FL, 2005. =1990s= In 1990, the newspaper launched the 24-hour OCN news channel with news and feature stories about Orange County. It closed in 2001.Moxley, R. Scott. \\"So Long, OCN\\", OC Weekly, Orange County, 20 September 2001. Retrieved on 23 May 2015. In 1992, Orange County Register Communications launched Exc√©lsior, a Spanish-language weekly. In 2010 Exc√©lsior had a circulation of 51,000. It covers Orange County's growing Hispanic community, which now numbers over a million. Julio Saenz is the editor and general manager. In 1999, Threshie became Chairman of the Board of Freedom Communications, and N. Christian Anderson III assumed the position of publisher and chief executive officer. =2000s= Ken Brusic was named vice president of content and executive editor in April 2002. In 2003, a family schism led to a sale on Oct. 9th of a majority interest in Freedom Communications to investors led by the Blackstone Group and Providence Equity Partners. Through a stock arrangement, the Hoiles family descendants retained control of the board. In 2006, Orange County Register Communications launched the OC Post, a tabloid with shortened versions of Register stories as well as news articles from the Associated Press. The paper also had its first significant staff reductions in December 2006, with 40 newsroom employees taking buyouts, along with a small number of layoffs. By April 2007, The Orange County Register had made additional staff cuts to help maintain shareholder profit, which had averaged more than 20 percent annually in the preceding five years. Since the launch of the OC Post in 2006, OCRC has cut the Register's editorial staff by 10 percent, eliminated its 3% holiday bonuses for editorial staff. and postponed pay raises to editorial staff, which had averaged 3 percent annually, for six months. In September 2007, Terry Horne replaced N. Christian Anderson III as publisher. In June 2008, KTLA, The Los Angeles Times and Fox News reported that the Register had begun a one-month trial of outsourcing some layout and copy-editing work to India to save costs. The trial was not deemed a success, and since then editing has been done by the Register in Orange County. In spring of 2009, Freedom Communications instituted furloughs for all employees nationwide, followed by a permanent 5% pay cut starting in July 2009. News reports in August 2009 indicated that Freedom Communications planned to file for bankruptcy and turn control of its publications, including The Orange County Register, over to its lenders. In September 2009, a column written by sports columnist Mark Whicker caused controversy. In the column, Whicker wrote about various sporting events that had occurred over the preceding 18 years, and how they had been missed by Jaycee Dugard, a girl who had been kidnapped, raped, and forced to bear her kidnapper's children. Whicker ended his column with the line \\"Jaycee, you have left the yard.\\" The column generated widespread criticism and was parodied in blogs such as Deadspin, who called it \\"the single worst piece of journalism ever committed on this page,\\" and The Huffington Post. =2010s= On July 25, 2012, The Orange County Register and six other papers were purchased by 2100 Trust LLC. The papers continued to operate under the Freedom Communications name.Ken Bensinger, \\"O.C. Register Sellers Sue New Ower,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 1, 2013, page 33 In December the Register changed its logo and branding, dropping \\"The\\" in favor of Orange County Register. A lawsuit was filed in October 2013 by the former owners of Freedom Communications against Aaron Kushner, principal of 2100 Trust, demanding that Kushner's company pay more than $17 million remaining on the sale. The Los Angeles Times wrote that Kushner, \\"a former greeting-card executive with no prior media experience,\\" claimed that the prior owners had given him \\"inaccurate valuations for a host of crucial financial indicators\\" and that he faced \\"$62.3 million in unexpected financial liabilities as a result.\\" On August 19, 2013, the Long Beach Register was launched as an edition of the Orange County Register serving the Long Beach, California, community. It was focused solely on community news, including city government, public and private education, local sports coverage, business and entertainment as an intended competitor to the Long Beach Press-Telegram. In addition, on January 20, 2014, The Press- Enterprise became an edition of the Orange County Register while maintaining coverage of the Inland Empire. On April 16, 2014, the Orange County Register launched the Los Angeles Register, \\"more a print play than a digital one\\" serving Los Angeles County. It was the first time since the Herald-Examiner folded on November 1, 1989, that a main competitor to the Los Angeles Times was launched, this time intended to be \\"as local as one edition can be for the entire county.\\" Five months later, Kushner announced in a company memo that the Los Angeles Register was ending publication effective immediately. Kushner wrote that \\"pundits and local competitors\\" will be quick to call the effort a failure while he believes that \\"not taking bold steps toward growth\\" would have been the true failure. The Long Beach Register became a Sunday-only publication in June 2014, and ceased publication in December 2014. In October the Los Angeles Times sued the Register for failing to pay more than $2 million to the Times for delivery services for the now-defunct Register newspapers in Los Angeles and Long Beach. In March 2014 the Los Angeles Superior Court granted the Times a $4.2 million writ of attachment to secure the ability of the Times to enforce a possible judgment in its favor. On March 10, 2015, Aaron Kushner and his partner, Eric Spitz, resigned from executive duties at the paper and Freedom Communications Inc. The company was rumored to be readying itself for a potential sale. Publisher Rich Mirman, a former Las Vegas casino executive who had invested in Freedom, was announced as the new president and chief executive. On February 12, 2016, Freedom Communications announced that the Orange County Register and the Press-Enterprise along with its websites, community weeklies and the two Spanish-Language weeklies Excelsior in Orange County and La Prensa in the Inland Empire, were being placed in a \\"stalking horse\\" auction after the company declared bankrupt at the end of 2015. Both Digital First Media and Tribune Publishing were the bidders. The auction started on March 21 and was completed on March 31, 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the sale of Freedom Communications to Tribune Publishing because it would create a newspaper monopoly in both Orange and Riverside Counties..On March 21, 2016, Digital First Media acquired both the Orange County Register and the Press-Enterprise for $52.3 million in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana. Los Angeles News Group was renamed Southern California News Group on March 31, 2016, once the sale of Freedom Communications to Digital First Media was completed. It has 11 paid regional dailies, and community weeklies serving the South Bay communities of Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes Peninsula, the Long Beach neighborhoods north and east of downtown and over 20 community weeklies in Orange County, as well as the Spanish-language weeklies Impacto USA and Unidos, now consolidated as Excelsior, which will have three editions for Los Angeles County, Orange County and Inland Empire. On Sept. 21, 2016, it was announced that the Register would move its headquarters to 2190 Towne Centre Place, Anaheim, and vacate its longtime home at 625 N. Grand Ave., Santa Ana. The new headquarters opened April 24, 2017. The Alliance for Audited Media reported in 2017 that the Register's circulation had dropped to 80,000 on weekdays and 180,000 on Sundays. Editorial stances The Register was notable for its generally libertarian-leaning editorial page. Although it sometimes supported Republican politicians and positions, it was the largest newspaper in the country to have opposed the Iraq War from the beginning and opposed laws regulating issues such as prostitution and drug use. It was one of a handful of newspapers that opposed the internment of Japanese aliens and Japanese-Americans during World War II. It also opposed Proposition 8 in 2008, which proposed a ban on same- sex marriage. After the Digital First purchase of Freedom Communications, the Registers editorial page was merged with that of the Los Angeles Daily News and Digital First's other papers in the region to form a single editorial board for the Southern California News Group on regional and national issues.

During the execution of a standard cartwheel, the performer's body is supported by the hands while transitioning through the inverted orientation whereas an aerial cartwheel, performer is airborne while inverted. To compensate for lack of support from the hands, leg momentum is employed to keep the performer airborne until the leading foot touches down. Aerial cartwheels can be executed while running or from a stationary, standing position. The front leg lunges and the back leg drives back creating momentum. Aerial cartwheels are also known by various other names, including side flip, side somersault, air cartwheel, no-hands cartwheels, or simply aerials. Aerial cartwheels are performed in gymnastics, cheerleading, acro dance, free running, tricking, and martial arts such as wushu and capoeira. In a martial arts context, the aerial cartwheel is visually interesting but of little value to combatants. Consequently, it is commonly seen in martial arts exhibitions, performances, and movies, but seldom used in sparring matches and fights. Learning the Proper Technique Aerial Cartwheels are done at a person's own risk and injuries are known to occur. Learning the proper technique and taking classes to learn about the skill reduces the chance of acquiring an injury. Aerials can be properly taught in gymnastics, dance, aerobic, martial arts, cheer, and tumbling classes. Classes have an instructor that can properly teach the steps for completing an aerial and the equipment to guide the learning process which reduces the chance of developing an injury. An Aerial cartwheel involves intense coordination, concentration, balance, strength, flexibility, stamina, and power. Strength training and stretching helps develop the structure prior to trying the exercise to make the performance easier. Variations *Tucked aerial, in which legs are tucked, resulting in faster rotation. This is similar to the capoiera skill A√∫ sem M√£o. *Side somi, similar to a tucked aerial, but the legs are held in the tucked position and there is a 90-degree rotation. *Axe to aerial, in which a leg is raised to shoulder or head height and then swung down (in a fashion similar to an axe kick), whereupon it becomes the leading leg of an aerial. A variant of this where the practitioner lands in the splits was popularized by Willem Stockton and was even called by some the Willem Aerial. *Aeriola, also known as a reverse aerial, is an aerial preceded by a backward step, resulting in backward travel during the aerial. *Barani, also known as a free round-off, in which legs are brought together in mid-air, landing on both feet. *Gardiner, also known as aerial switch, in which the trailing leg swings ahead of the leading leg so as to become the first to land. *Aerial to the splits. Most aerial variants can terminate in the splits.

Biography She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of a Baptist minister, the Rev. James Phillips. She attended Sumner High School in St. Louis and Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, and did graduate studies in music and in sociology at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. At the age of 14 she was one of the soloists at the dedication of the Municipal Auditorium in St. Louis. She was the first black singer to perform with the Metropolitan Opera chorus (seven years before Marian Anderson's debut\\"Phillips, Helen L.\\", Contemporary Black Biography, 2008.) --later saying she just \\"slipped in\\".Michael S.

Her agent had been told to send his best soprano as an extra for five performances of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana in 1947 -- and though the stage manager was momentarily non-plussed by her race, did nothing to hamper her debut. Among the stories she recounted about her world travels was an episode on the Oriental Express, when she encountered two Russian soldiers \\"who started deriding the United States and talking about the plight of Negroes in this country, During the course of the conversation, one took my glasses and refused to give them back. Then he tried to get fresh, and I slapped him good and hard.\\" Throughout the 1940s and 1950s he was primarily a concert singer, touring the United States, Europe, Africa, and South America. She was noted for her interpretation of German Lieder and Negro spirituals, and, fluent in German, toured Austria and West Germany for the State Department after World War II. She made her Town Hall debut in 1953, and was in a City Center production of Show Boat in 1954. Retiring from the stage, she became a teacher and vocal coach.

The knee joint is most commonly affected. Signs and symptoms When symptomatic, the disease classically begins with symptoms which are similar to a gout attack (thus the monicker \\"pseudogout\\"). These include: * severe pain * warmth * swelling of one or more joints The symptoms can be monoarticular (involving a single joint) or polyarticular (involving several joints).

This condition can also be associated with Milwaukee shoulder syndrome. Cause Calcium pyrophosphate The cause of CPPD disease is unknown. Increased breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP; the molecule used as energy currency in all living things), which results in increased pyrophosphate levels in joints, is thought to be one reason why crystals may develop. Familial forms are rare. One genetic study found an association between CPPD and a region of chromosome 8q. The gene ANKH is involved in crystal-related inflammatory reactions and inorganic phosphate transport. Diagnosis The disease is defined by presence of joint inflammation and the presence of CPPD crystals within the joint. The crystals are usually detected by imaging and/or joint fluid analysis. X-ray of a knee with chondrocalcinosis. Medical imaging, consisting of x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound may detect chondrocalcinosis within the affected joint, indicating a substantial amount of calcium crystal deposition within the cartilage or ligaments. Ultrasound is a reliable method to diagnose CPPD. Using ultrasound, chondrocalcinosis may be depicted as echogenic foci with no acoustic shadow within the hyaline cartilageArend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Free chapter on acromioclavicular chondrocalcinosis is available at ShoulderUS.com or fibrocartilage. By x-ray, CPPD can appear similar to other diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and gout. Rhombus-shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystal seen in a knee arthrocentesis specimen. Arthrocentesis, or removing synovial fluid from the affected joint, is performed to test the synovial fluid for the calcium pyrophosphate crystals that are present in CPPD. When stained with H&E; stain, calcium pyrophosphate crystals appears deeply blue (\\"basophilic\\"). However, CPP crystals are much better known for their rhomboid shape and weak positive Birefringence on polarized light microscopy, and this method remains the most reliable method of identifying the crystals under the microscope. However, even this method suffers from poor sensitivity, specificity, and inter-operator agreement. These two modalities currently define CPPD disease, but lack diagnostic accuracy. Thus, the diagnosis of CPPD disease is potentially epiphenomenological. Treatment Because any medication that could reduce the inflammation of CPPD bears a risk of causing organ damage, treatment is not advised if the condition is not causing pain. For acute pseudogout, treatments include intra-articular corticosteroid injection, systemic corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or, on occasion, high-dose colchicine. In general, NSAIDs are administered in low doses to help prevent CPPD. However, if an acute attack is already occurring, higher doses are administered. If nothing else works, hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate may provide relief. Research into surgical removal of calcifications is underway, however this still remains an experimental procedure. Epidemiology The condition is more common in older adults. CPPD is estimated to affect 4% to 7% of the adult populations of Europe and the United States. This topic last updated: Jul 24, 2018. Previous studies have overestimated the prevalence by simply estimating the prevalence of chondrocalcinosis, which is found in many other conditions as well. It may cause considerable pain, but it is never fatal. Women are at a slightly higher risk than men, with an estimated ratio of occurrence of 1.4:1. History CPPD crystal deposition disease was originally described over 50 years ago. Terminology Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals are associated with a range of clinical syndromes, which have been given various names, based upon which clinical symptoms or radiographic findings are most prominent. A task force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) made recommendations on preferred terminology. Accordingly, calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) is an umbrella term for the various clinical subsets, whose naming reflects an emphasis on particular features. For example, pseudogout refers to the acute symptoms of joint inflammation or synovitis: red, tender, and swollen joints that may resemble gouty arthritis (a similar condition in which monosodium urate crystals are deposited within the joints). Chondrocalcinosis,Rothschild, Bruce M on the other hand, refers to the radiographic evidence of calcification in hyaline and/or fibrocartilage. \\"Osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD\\" reflects a situation where osteoarthritis features are the most apparent. Pyrophosphate arthropathy refers to several of these situations.

It lies on the A1079 road approximately to the west of the market town of Beverley. The Mere in Bishop Burton According to the 2011 UK census, Bishop Burton parish had a population of 696, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 628. There has been human activity in Bishop Burton for at least 10,000 years, with traces left from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Romano-British eras. The village (whose name may derive from Burtone, meaning fortified farmstead) is mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to the Archbishop of York and the site of Archbishop's Manor House continued to be the site of Manor Houses up to the demolition of High Hall in 1952. The parish church of All Saints is a Grade II* listed building and its earliest parts date from the late 12th century. The only other surviving religious building is the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, dating from 1840, which is now a house. All Saints Church There was a school in the village from 1743 to 1986. In a field to the east of the village is one of the medieval stone boundary markers for the sanctuary of Saint John of Beverley that is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The look and feel of the village - black and white colour scheme, rustic porches and clay pantiles - are the result of improvements to estate housing carried out by ERB Hall-Watt and Richard Hall- Watt (see below) in the late 19th and early 20th century. Subsequent development has often followed this architectural style to retain the unified feel of the village. It is readily apparent when it has not. Bishop Burton is home to Bishop Burton College, a further education and higher education college specialising in agriculture and equine studies. Bishop Burton is also the home to Bishop Burton United Football Club, formed in 2008 as Wilberforce & Larkin Football Club before moving to the village at the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season and changing the name to Bishop Burton United so as to emphasise their link with the village and their new home. Bishop Burton United play in the East Riding County Football League Division 3 with matches taking place on Saturdays with a 2 pm kick off. United's home ground is the 4G artificial surface at Bishop Burton College. United's local rivals are nearby sides Molescroft Rangers and Market Weighton United. United have a reputation as a progressive and ambitious football club with the lofty aim of gaining semi-professional status within the next 7 years. The club is also known for its broad multicultural mix with Polish, Latvian, French, Indonesian and Nigerian players in their squad. The Gee and Watt families of Bishop Burton Bishop-Burton Hall, Beverley, Yorkshire, the seat of R. Watt Esq. in 1829 The Gee family were associated with Arthur Pearson-Gee, the brother of Karl Pearson. The Gees came from Rothley in Leicestershire. *Henry Gee was the common ancestor of a senior branch of the family who remained in Rothley and the father of William Gee who first moved to Hull as a master mariner. * William Gee (1561‚Äì1611) became a Merchant of the Staple and acquired great wealth. He was sheriff of Hull in 1560 and mayor in 1562, 1573 and 1582. He was the benefactor of Hull Grammar School and founded a hospital for ten poor women. *His eldest son, William Gee (b.1562), was secretary of the Council of the North and Keeper of the Signet from 1604. He purchased the Bishop Burton estate in 1603 and built a hall. * The estate and hall both subsequently descended in the Gee family until being bought by Richard Watt (1751‚Äì1798) in 1783. Richard Watt had started life as a stable boy and coach driver at the village inn before joining a merchant ship bound for the West Indies. There he bought a plantation and exploited slave labour to produce rum and sugar. Some of his estate accounts for Jamaica are in the collection. * When Richard Watt (d.1798) died his estates were inherited by his nephew, Richard Watt (d.1812) and then his grandnephew, also Richard Watt (1786‚Äì1855). The latter was a horse breeder who had four winners of the St Leger. * When Richard Watt died in 1855, the estates passed to two of his sons before lying unoccupied until 1886 when they passed to Ernest Richard Bradley Hall-Watt (1865‚Äì1908). He was an early motoring enthusiast and died in a car accident. * He was succeeded by his son, Richard Hall-Watt (1898‚Äì1917), who was killed during the First World War. *Richard Hall-Watt was succeeded by his brother, Alvery Digby Hall-Watt (1901‚Äì1961), who sold the estate in 1930. It is now Bishop Burton Agricultural College. Monument to Rachel and Elizabeth Gee This alabaster monument was found in an old vault under the floor of the chancel in 1865 and restored to its position in the church. It is to Rachel, wife of William Gee Esq. of the Bishop Burton Estate. Rachel was the daughter of Thomas Parker of Ratton, and she died in 1649 aged 33. William Gee Esq. (d 1683) was the grandson of Sir William Gee of Bishop Burton (d.1611), secretary to James I (r.1603‚Äì25). Sir William, then of Beverley, bought the estate after it was surrendered to the crown in 1543, being part of the Archbishop of York's estate. The memorial now consists of the shrouded figure of Rachel, full length with her face, one arm and hand exposed, and the small figure of a child which kneels at her head. These two items are thought to have been part of a larger monument, which has probably been destroyed.

The lake is located entirely in Alachua County, but is bounded on the east and South side by Bradford County, Clay County, and Putnam County. The Alachua County boundary extends to the ordinary high water line (normally the shoreline), which is above mean sea level. It forms the headwaters of the Santa Fe River, exiting from a \\"little\\" northern area (Little Lake Santa Fe) emptying into the Suwannee River. Lake Santa Fe offers abundant wildlife, excellent fishing and recreational boating. It is one of the largest and most stable lakes in Florida. At \\"the pass\\" between the \\"big\\" southern arm and Little Lake Santa Fe shad school, and fishing is usually good for schooling largemouth bass and stocked sunshine bass. Numerous homes surround the lake, most with docks and ski boats; fishing is always best early and late or at night and on weekdays. In spite of development, the fish habitat is outstanding with many areas of bald cypress and healthy maidencane grass beds. The lake was stocked with 44,500 hybrid striped bass in April 2005. The previous stocking of the lake occurred in 1997. Lake Santa Fe is the third most stable of 120 lakes studied in Florida, as well as one of the clearest. It is designated by the State of Florida as an Outstanding Florida Water. It is supported by water flowing in at the southern extremity of the intermediate aquifer that outcrops in the lake bottom. Also it is a rather deep example of a karstic lake, with several spots that are 30-feet (9 m) or more. Lake Santa Fe was the largest of a series of lakes that were connected by dredging canals in the 1870s and 1880s so that boats could travel between Melrose, Florida (at the time the center of a thriving citrus and tourist industry) and Waldo, the railroad terminal. The canal was dredged from Little Lake Santa Fe into Lake Alto. This canal is visible today. Water and railroad were the major means of transportation for passengers and freight across Florida at that time. Prosperity in this area followed the Reconstruction. The first boat that made the journey through the canal system was the \\"Fannie S. Lewis\\" in 1880, and the last was the \\"City of Melrose\\" in 1925. Improved roads and the automobile doomed the era of steamships in Alachua County and the canals fell into disuse. The rural unincorporated communities of Melrose and Earleton are located on the lake. North of the lakes is Santa Fe Swamp, mostly a wildlife and environmental conservation area managed by the Suwannee River Water Management District.

Besides his work for television, he is best known for his screenplays for Hotaru (2001) and Shijushichinin no shikaku, Kon Ichikawa's 1994 version of the Forty-seven r≈çnin story. Both of these were nominated but did not win the Award of the Japanese Academy for \\"Best Screenplay\\".  Background  Takeyama graduated from the Literature program at Waseda University. He then became a dramatist working in television production, and credited with screenplays beginning in 1979. In the early 1980s, Takeyama worked in Nikkatsu's softcore Roman Porno films, writing three scripts for Sh≈çgor≈ç Nishimura, director of Apartment Wife: Affair In the Afternoon (1971), the first entry in this long-running series. For Nishimura, Takeyama penned Nurses' Journal: Nasty File (1980), K≈çichir≈ç Uno's Girl Dormitory (1980), and \\"My Girlfriend Wears a Uniform\\" (1981).  Film  Takeyama co-wrote director Kon Ichikawa's 1994 film 47 Ronin, working on the screenplay with the director. Variety writes of the film's storyline that it, \\"reportedly sticks closer to the historical events than other versions have,\\" and that it is, \\"clean and uninflected, with the action zipping back and forth between a series of indoor locations (denoted by captions).\\" The review points out that the amount of historical detail given in the film is likely to alienate audiences who are not familiar with the story of the Forty-seven Ronin. With Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, Takeyama wrote the comedy-drama Kah-chan (2001). As Ichikawa's 75th film, Variety writes that the film is a \\"career milestone of nonetheless minor artistic significance\\". Reviewed under the English title Big Mama Variety judged, \\"[t]hough smoothly done, 'Big Mama' never provides any compelling reason why its formula serio-comedy occupies the big-screen rather than the small -- or better yet, a legit stage matinee.\\" Takeyama wrote the script for controversial director Takashi Miike's Sabu (2002), based on the novel of the same title by Sh≈´gor≈ç Yamamoto, the author upon whose work Kurosawa based his Sanjuro (1962) and Red Beard (1965). Originally a 90-minute TV film made to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Nagoya Broadcasting Network, the film was given a 121-minute theatrical release. In many ways atypical of director Miike's work, Sabu is a coming-of-age period drama set in the Edo period involving a friendship between two boys.  Television  Takeyama was in charge of the writing of the yearly NHK Taiga dramas Hideyoshi (1996) and Toshiie to Matsu (2002). Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs gave Takeyama an award for his script for Sabu, and the Grand Prize for his work on Ten to sen (2008). His work for television is regularly included in the Writers Guild of Japan's annual anthology of the best writing for the medium. His teleplays were printed in the Guild's anthologies for 1983 (Sh≈çnen H), 1987 (ÊÅã‰∫∫„Åü„Å°„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„ÅüÂ†¥ÊâÄ), 1994 (Ê∏ÖÂ∑¶Ë°õÈñÄÊÆãÊó•Èå≤ Á¨¨ÂçÅÂõûÔºçÂ§¢), 2000 (Sh≈çnen H), 2003 (Sabu), and 2008 (Ten to Sen).

Justice is a fictional character played by Jackie Gleason in the films Smokey and the Bandit (1977), Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983). He is a determined, foul-mouthed Texas sheriff, from the real Montague County or the fictional Portague County at various points, and he chases \\"the Bandit\\" all over the Southern United States. Personality Buford T. Justice is an archetypal, if not clich√©d, Southern sheriff. While he can be charming and professional, his pursuit of the Bandit is a deeply personal affair (compounded by the fact the Bandit absconded with his son Junior's fiancee, embarrassing the Justice family as a whole). Justice tends to take his hunt for the Bandit to the extremes and quite often this leads to the wrecking of his squad cars. He nonetheless remains behind the wheel of the wrecked cars and refers to them as \\"evidence.\\" He shuns help from other law enforcement departments, often alienating them, so that he can personally apprehend the Bandit. Sheriff Justice is chivalrous towards women and the elderly, yet he has no problem casually roughing up suspects (especially \\"young punks\\") to make a point. Indeed, he kicks a would- be tire thief in the backside as \\"an attention-getter,\\" and he knees another in the groin. When Justice does have someone in custody, he smugly draws the affair out, obviously relishing the fact he is making things as unpleasant as possible for the suspect. Justice takes any skirting of the law very personally, and says emphatically, \\"What we‚Äôre dealin' with here is a complete lack of respect for the law!\\" In Smokey and the Bandit and Smokey and the Bandit Part II, Sheriff Justice is the primary antagonist to the Bandit (played by Burt Reynolds), while in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 he is the primary protagonist, as Big and Little Enos Burdette challenge him to make a run for them from Miami, Florida to their ranch on the outskirts of Austin, Texas in 24 hours, while carrying a stuffed shark on the roof of his squad car (which is the logo of their \\"Fish & Chips\\" fast food franchise), for a prize of $250,000 (Justice would have had to have given his sheriff's badge to the Enoses if he lost the bet). Justice seems to have no love for Big and Little Enos and does not hide it, as their hiring of the Bandit to do their runs in the past had led Buford into many humiliating predicaments while hunting the Bandit, and berates them (especially on Little Enos, attacking him for his small stature). While Justice enjoys the idea of capturing and imprisoning the Bandit for all the things he has done to him in the past, in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 this changes when he finally captures the Bandit (not knowing it was Cledus \\"the Snowman\\" Snow posing as the Bandit in a plan by the Enoses to make Justice lose the bet). Justice proceeds to have an open \\"heart to heart\\" conversation with a hallucination of the real Bandit (Reynolds in a cameo), where he finally discovers that he had developed an unexpected fondness for the Bandit and despite the fact he was planning to retire after this run, the memory of his disastrous retirement in Miami Beach at the opening of the film and the idea of living a life with no excitement as the voice of his son overplays in his mind, Justice has second thoughts and lets him go (giving him a five-minute head start) so he can resume chasing him, thus ending the film, and the franchise, in another hot pursuit. Family Sheriff Justice is always accompanied by his foolish, yet devoted son Junior (played by Mike Henry). Junior's actual name is never revealed. Justice mainly calls him Junior, but at times also calls him \\"Moose Twit\\", \\"Tick-Turd\\" and \\"Barrel of Monkey Nuts\\" among other things. He constantly berates his son, yet Junior always remains loyal and devoted to his father. A repeated remark Justice makes to his son throughout the trilogy is \\"There is no way, NO WAY, that you could come from my loins!\\". Justice's wife, Wilhelmina, is often referred to but never seen in the films. He makes many unpleasant remarks about her, alluding that she is probably ugly, overweight, and smelly. She is probably racist as well, as Justice says in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 that she joined the Ku Klux Klan and looked like an iceberg with feet when she put on her white sheet. Justice has two brothers who are also in law enforcement, Gaylord Justice and Reginald Van Justice, both played by Jackie Gleason. He enlists their help in Smokey and the Bandit II. They bring an armada of Canadian Mounties, led by Reginald, and Texas Highway Patrolmen, led by Gaylord, but the armada is demolished when the Snowman brings a convoy of trucks to rescue the Bandit. Vehicles of choice Sheriff Justice's squad cars differ from film to film, which get wrecked in various ways due to his overzealous pursuit of the Bandit. In the first film, his car is a bronze 1977 Pontiac LeMans with two blue single lights and Texas Exempt plate 86‚ãÜ523: This loses the back right side fender, the top, the driver's side door and the back right side passenger door, the front right wheel, and the trunk lid. In the second film his car is a gold color 1980 Pontiac Bonneville, with two single red emergency lights on the edges, two extra smaller ones (one red and one blue) and large megaphone in the center that completes this display with Texas exempt plate 03‚ãÜ999: It gets its back right side fender buckled, the left side of the emergency light display destroyed, and megaphone buckled downwards. Finally, after a desert demolition derby between trucks and police cars, Justice emerges from the fight with his car folded up in the middle and missing its doors and roof. Is important to note, that in many scenes a Pontiac Grand Ville was painted with the exact looks as the Justice's Bonneville to be use as a stand-in in the film, and was the one been hit by Snowman's truck in Miami, turned upside down by the football player, as well falling from a draw bridge - in fact the final damage suffered by the car after the desert battle (folded up) uses the Grand Ville, not the Bonneville. Only two scenes show the Bonneville getting scrapes: in the fair, where Justice destroys the supports of a roller coaster causing it collapse, and in the desert demolition derby where Snowman's truck hits the Justice's car. Also, when the film ends, Justice is seen commandeering a passenger bus still in pursuit of the Bandit. In the third film, his final car is a light blue 1983 Pontiac Bonneville, with two single emergency lights (each sharing a blue-red display) and two smaller red ones, with the center of the display open to have the shark replica tied up during the run, and it also had a \\"Sheriff\\" decal located on the trunk and Texas plate 8RA-349. Of the three cars, the third vehicle is put through the most punishment: This loses its driver's side front fender, gets sprayed with paint on the right side, gets buried in sand, loses its front bumper in a tug of war with a tow truck, gets partially burned in the back after being shot through a car cannon, its sides get scrapes and buckled in many side collisions with many cars, proceeds to get two flat tires and loses its trunk lid. Finally while hunting the fake Bandit (Jerry Reed) through a field, the Enos' set off a series of explosives, one of which destroys all of the remaining bodywork - the car emerges from the dust cloud functional, leaving the engine, seats, and police light bar (being held by Junior above his head). Despite the enormous amount of damage they suffer, Justice's cars still come out from each situation operable. Soundtrack theme Buford T. Justice has a leitmotif in the films of imposing, menacing trumpets (somewhat reminiscent of the Dragnet theme), reflecting his authoritative bluster - while the leitmotif tune appears in the films, it is surprisingly not present in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. Character origin \\"Buford T. Justice\\" was the name of a real Florida Highway Patrolman known to Burt Reynolds' father, who himself was once Chief of Police of Riviera Beach, Florida. Reynolds' father was also the inspiration for the word \\"sumbitch\\" used in the movie, a phrase he reportedly uttered quite often. Reynolds recalled meeting Gleason: \\"I'd met Jackie once in Florida where he lived, and he'd done an impression of a Southern sheriff that caused me to fall down laughing. Overly polite to women, Jackie explained, those sheriffs would get the man and say, \\"Look you sumbitch, what the fuck you think you're doin?\\" Von Doviak, Scott Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema p. 34 Director Hal Needham gave Gleason free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. In the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in the \\"choke and puke\\" (roadside diner), Reynolds said that it was Gleason's \\"idea to have the toilet paper coming out of his pantleg when he left the Bar-B-Q.\\" Von Doviak, Scott Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema pp. 34-35 See also * Smokey and the Bandit * Sheriff J.W.

The lamplighter in Brest, Belarus (15 October 2011). A lamplighter is a person employed to light and maintain candle or, later, gas street lights. Very few exist today as most gas street lighting has long been replaced by electric lamps. Function Lights were lit each evening, generally by means of a wick on a long pole. At dawn, they would return to put them out using a small hook on the same pole. Early street lights were generally candles, oil, and similar consumable liquid or solid lighting sources with wicks. Other duties Another lamplighter duty was to carry a ladder and renew the candles, oil, or gas mantles. In some communities, lamplighters served in a role akin to a town watchman; in others, it may have been seen as little more than a sinecure. In the 19th century, gas lights became the dominant form of street lighting. Early gaslights required lamplighters, but eventually systems were developed which allowed the lights to operate automatically. Today Today a lamplighter is an extremely rare job. In Brest as a tourist attraction a lamplighter has been employed since 2009 to light up the kerosene lamps in the shopping street every day. A small team of lamplighters still operate in London, England where gas lights have been installed by English Heritage.https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/01/15/377470376/carrying- the-torch-for-londons-last-gas-lamps In Waikiki, Hawaii, lamplighters in traditional Hawaiian costumes run along the shore and light gas torches in the evening. Frank Serpico, an NYPD whistleblower, prefers to use the term \\"lamp- lighter\\" to describe the whistleblower's role as a watchman.Frank Serpico section, The Independent, U.K. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a spy novel written by John le Carr√©, refers to Lamplighters as a section of British Intelligence that provided surveillance and couriers. Lamplighter's Serenade is a song written by Hoagy Carmichael. It was recorded by Frank Sinatra during his first session as a solo artist, on 19 January 1942. Bing Crosby also recorded a version of the song just days later. The Old Lamp-Lighter is another song; its music was written by Nat Simon, the lyrics by Charles Tobias. The song was published in 1946.  Modern outdoors usage  Modern gas street light in Berlin, Germany (2005) In the late-19th and 20th centuries, most cities with gas streetlights replaced them with new electric streetlights. For example, Baltimore, the first US city to install gas streetlights, removed nearly all of them in 1957. A gas lamp is located at N. Holliday Street and E. Baltimore Street as a monument to the first gas lamp in America, erected at that location. However, gas lighting of streets has not disappeared completely from some cities, and the few municipalities that retained gas lighting now find that it provides a pleasing nostalgic effect. Gas lighting is also seeing a resurgence in the luxury home market for those in search of historical authenticity. The largest gas lighting network in the world is that of Berlin. With about 37,000 lamps (2014), it holds more than half of all working gas street lamps in the world. In central London around 1500 gas lamps still operate, lighting the Royal Parks, the exterior of Buckingham Palace and almost the entire Covent Garden area. The Park Estate in Nottingham retains much of its original character, including the original gas lighting network. In the United States, more than 2800 gas lights in Boston operate in the historic districts of Beacon Hill, Back Bay, Bay Village, Charlestown, and parts of other neighborhoods. In Cincinnati, Ohio, more than 1100 gas lights operate in areas that have been named historic districts. Gas lights also operate in parts of the famed French Quarter and outside historic homes throughout the city in New Orleans. South Orange, New Jersey, has adopted the gaslight as the symbol of the town, and uses them on nearly all streets. Several other towns in New Jersey also retain gas lighting: Glen Ridge, Palmyra, Riverton, and some parts of Orange, Cape May and Cherry Hill. The village of Riverside, Illinois, still uses its original gas street lights that are an original feature of the Frederick Law Olmsted planned community. Manhattan Beach, California, has a gas lamp section in which all the sidewalks are lit by public gas lamps.

From the 1860s the parish was much excavated for its iron ore, which lay underneath a layer of limestone and was quarried over the course of 100 years or more. Local furnaces produced pig iron and later the quarries supplied ore for the steel works at Corby. A disused quarry face in the south of the parish is a geological SSSI.

History =Domesday Book= In 1086 when the Domesday Book was completed, Finedon was a large royal manor, previously held by Queen Edith. At this time the village (now a town) was known as Tingdene, which originates from the Old English words √æing meaning assembly or meeting and Denu meaning valley or vale.English Place Name Society Retrieved 22 March 2012 Tingdene and the later version, Thingdon, were used until the early nineteenth century until finally Finedon became the commonly accepted version, both in written format as well as in pronunciation.John Bailey, Finedon Otherwise Thingdon, 1975, At the time of the Domesday Book Finedon was one of only four towns listed with a population greater than 50 in Northamptonshire - the others being Northampton, Brackley and Rushton. The Bell Inn also claims to be listed in the Domesday Book, but the current building does not date back to this period, and there is evidence that the original inn was situated several hundred metres away. However, the main building was built around 1598, with the current fa√ßade added in 1872. =St Mary's Church= 240px The Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, is a mid-14th-century church with an aisled nave of four bays.

The tower houses a ring of eight bells in the key of D, with the tenor weighing just over 21 hundredweight (about 1.1 tonnes).Finedon Bellringers The church also houses an organ which was probably originally built for St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in 1704.National Pipe Organ Register, N03520 It was installed in 1717, rebuilt in 1872, and restored in 1960,National Pipe Organ Register, N03521 and it retains its tracker action. =Finedon Hall= Finedon Hall Finedon Hall is a Grade II listed 17th- or 18th-century country house with later modifications. It is built in the Tudor style to an H-shaped floor plan in two storeys with attics. It is constructed in ironstone ashlar with limestone dressings and a slate roof. The house has now been converted into apartments. =Finedon Obelisk= 200px The Finedon Obelisk is a monument erected in 1789 to record the blessings of the year by Sir John English Dolben, the fourth and last of the Dolben baronets and lord of the manor of Finedon. The blessings are thought to include the return to sanity of George III. The 23 April 1789 was appointed a day of thanksgiving to commemorate the event, which in Finedon was celebrated with bell ringing, fireworks and the firing of cannon. The obelisk is located in a small enclosure next to the A6 and A510 roundabout. =Volta Tower= Finedon was formerly home to the Volta Tower, a folly built in 1865 by William Harcourt Isham Mackworth-Dolben of Finedon Hall. It was built to commemorate the death of his eldest son, Lieutenant Commander William Digby Dolben, who drowned off the west coast of Africa on 1 September 1863, aged 24. The building stood for 86 years before collapsing in 1951, killing one of its residents. =Water Tower= The Water Tower was completed in 1904, originally costing ¬£1500 to build, with the whole scheme of public water provision for Finedon costing ¬£13,000. The tower is octagonal in shape and is divided into five interior stages. The exterior of the building is a red, yellow and blue polychrome brick design with a lead and plain-tile roof. The Water Tower has since been converted into a private residence and in 1973, gained Grade II listed status.British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 15 July 2015. It stands as a local landmark beside the A6 on the southern entrance into Finedon. Governance At the introduction of modern Local Government by the Local Government Act 1894, Finedon was designated an Urban District, with an Urban District Council. In 1935 the Finedon Urban District was abolished, and Finedon became part of the Wellingborough Urban District. In 1983, Finedon Parish Council was established, to provide better local representation and influence in decision- making. it currently has thirteen members. In 2018, the parish adopted the name Finedon Town Council. The town is within the Borough of Wellingborough and the Wellingborough Parliamentary constituency. Education Finedon is served by two primary schools, the Finedon Infant School for children aged 4 to 7, and the Finedon Mulso Church of England Junior school for ages 7 to 11. The two schools became federated in 2011 and are now operated as one school with one headteacher. Supervisory childcare is available both before and after conventional school hours by the Apple Tree Club, located next to the Infant School.Finedon Schools Website Retrieved 16 July 2015. There is no secondary school in Finedon, so pupils are required to travel outside of the town to continue their education after leaving the Junior school. Huxlow Science College in Irthlingborough accommodates the large majority of these pupils, with the provision of a free bus pass. It is not uncommon however for some to attend Latimer Arts College in Barton Seagrave or Bishop Stopford School in Kettering.

Pocket Park 180px From 1939 until 1946 ironstone was extracted from the quarry at Finedon and transported via a railway line to the main line at Wellingborough. Rather than filling in the railway cutting and quarry and returning it to agricultural land, the people of Finedon campaigned to retain it as an important wildlife area. In 1984, it was designated the first Pocket Park in the country.Northamptonshire County Council, Pocket Parks Retrieved 5 July 2017 The heritage of the park as a quarry led to it earning its local name \\"The Pits\\". The quarry area is predominantly grassland and scrub with ponds supporting a diverse range of amphibians. The majority of the railway cutting is woodland containing mainly ash, sycamore and oak. The park is owned by the Borough Council of Wellingborough and is managed by a team of volunteers from the Finedon branch of the Northamptonshire Wildlife Trust to maximise its benefit for the flora and fauna. Scrub in the quarry is cut back to maintain the grassland, whilst large trees and other patches of scrub are left to provide feeding and nesting sites for birds. The ponds are also managed to ensure they do not become completely overhung by trees. Old coppiced lime trees estimated to be over three hundred years as well as yews of considerable age are to be found alongside the labyrinth of trails that cross the site. Access to the park can be found via Station Road and Avenue Road, next to the Finedon Dolben Cricket Club. To the south western side of Finedon Pocket Park is another nature reserve, Finedon Cally Banks,Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire Retrieved 15 July 2015 owned and managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The name Cally Banks comes from the process of burning iron ore to remove impurities, leaving a deposit called calcine which provides the poor soil conditions in which wildflowers flourish. Finedon ironstone The dark brown ironstone that underlies the parish is one of Northamptonshire's more durable building stones, unlike much of the ironstone elsewhere in the county which can become crumbly or delaminate. The 14th- century church is built mainly from this stone, which is presumed to have been quarried locally (with paler coloured limestone of Weldon Stone around the windows and door.) Other older buildings in the town also use the local ironstone, notably the vicarage and a house opposite the church built in 1712 as a charity school for girls. The various works of the Dolben family also make use of the ironstone. Chemical changes within the stone, while it was still in the ground, have resulted in a hard crystalline mineral version of Limonite which bonds the particles together, creating a harder, more durable ironstone, but which was still workable when lifted from the ground. An Enclosure map of 1805 records two stone pits in the town. =Quarries= In the early part of Britain's industrial revolution the Northamptonshire ironstone was ignored as a source of iron ore because unlike areas such as South Wales and the north of England, it had no coal to power the furnaces. In the mid 19th century the railways arrived, which meant that either the ore could be taken to distant furnaces, or coal brought to furnaces near the iron deposits. Both happened at Finedon from the 1860s.  Glendon Iron Ore Company  Quarries in the Finedon and Burton Latimer area, began with the workings of the Glendon Iron Ore Company, who in 1866 built the Finedon Furnaces, near Finedon station, along the eastern side the Midland Railway that had opened in 1857. Furnace Lane still runs through the industrial estate where the furnace once stood. The open-top furnace produced pig iron from 1866 to 1891, and numerous quarry pits to the north, east and south of the town were engaged in the laborious task of clearing back overlying rocks (sometimes up to 25 feet thick) using wheelbarrows and planks. The underlying ironstone was then loaded into wagons which used a series of tramways to get the ore to the furnace, or later processed at a Calciting plant and then transported by rail to furnaces in the coal fields of Derbyshire or beyond.  Stanton Ironworks  Areas south and east of the town were quarried by the Stanton Ironworks Company, who began using Northamptonshire ironstone in 1865. By 1869 they were leasing quarries on the Finedon Hall estate and built a narrow-gauge tramway to connect to the Midland Railway, and from there the ore was transported by rail to their furnaces at Stanton by Dale, Derbyshire.  Neilson's Quarries  Walter Neilson was quarrying in areas close to the town, either side of Ryegate Hill from before 1879. In 1881 he laid Neilson's Tramway a gauge tramway down to sidings on the Midland Railway. These siding were called \\"Neilson's Sidings\\" until at least the 1990s. Neilson's original pits were exhausted by 1892 and he leased new land on the east side of Finedon Road, immediately south of the town. This new pit was known as Thingdon Quarry. In 1911 Neilson's operation was taken over by Wellingborough Iron Company (see below).  Wellingborough Iron Company  To the south and east of the town, several companies operated quarries. Amongst these were the Rixon Iron and Brick company, which began quarrying near Finedon in 1874. Rixon laid the gauge Wellingborough Tramway to connect their ironstone pits to sidings of the Midland Railway. Rixon built their own ironworks alongside the Midland Railway in 1884. In 1887, Rixon's company declared bankruptcy and was taken over by the newly-formed Wellingborough Iron Company. They relaid the tramway and opened up several more ironstone pits south of Finedon. In 1911, Stanton took over Neilson's Thingdon Quarry immediately south of the town and started a series underground mines there in 1913. In 1932, the whole operation was merged with the Stanton Ironworks company. Stanton Ironworks Company was acquired by Stewarts & Lloyds in 1939, which was one of the companies that were merged and nationalised to become British Steel in 1967.  Ironstone production  Quarried ironstone from the area had initially produced pig iron for use in cast-iron production. After 1879, with the development of the Gilchrist-Thomas converter the production of steel was made possible using iron ore with a high Phosphate content, such as the Northamptonshire Ironstone. Around Finedon the quarries south of the town near Ryebury Hill and Sidegate Lane had been worked extensively between the 1870s and 1900s, using a labour-intensive method in which a long trench (or gullet) through the overburden was established, along which a tramway could transport the ore. The overburden (often of considerable depth) was loaded into wheelbarrows and taken via planks suspended over the trench, to be dumped on the far side, so that the next section of ore could be dug out. In this way the trench would gradually migrate across a field, and the reinstated land would be several feet lower than the surrounding fields. In the 20th century the introduction of ever larger dragline excavators allowed faster working with far fewer people employed. The smaller steel plants had all been merged in 1967 and most were shut down in favour of the Corby Works. This too ceased steel production in 1980, and all Finedon quarrying had ceased by that point. =Geological SSSI= Finedon Top Lodge SSSI Quarry Face Towards the southern end of the parish, one of the quarries that had been worked since at least the 1920s is Finedon Top Lodge Quarry. By the mid-1960 it was being worked by Stewarts & Lloyds Ltd (to whom it was known as Wellingborough No. 5 pit), who transported the ironstone to the steel works at Corby. In 1986 it was declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest on account of its geological significance. Although the quarry is no longer in use, the surviving rock-face has been given legal protection for its value in showing a representative section through the Middle Jurassic sedimentary beds. At its base, although no longer visible, is the ironstone which is part of the 'Northampton Sand Formation' of rocks. Everything above the ironstone would have been just 'overburden' to the quarrymen, which needed to be excavated and moved to the other side of the gullet, to allow the ironstone to be accessed. However they are now a piece of the evidence in building up an understanding of how the geology of Northamptonshire during the Jurassic period came into being. Almost all the layers of rock in the overburden were laid down during the Bathonian Stage of the Middle Jurassic. The layers accumulated over some 2 million years, beginning 168 million years ago, several million years after the ironstone had stopped being deposited. The cliff face reveals a layer of limestone and other material known as the 'Wellingborough Member' for which this quarry face is the type section. Above that is a further of harder limestone beds known as the 'Blisworth Limestone Formation'. Climate Finedon, much like the rest of the British Isles, experiences an oceanic climate and as such does not endure extreme temperatures and benefits from fairly evenly spread rainfall throughout the year.

He was also known as the Wonderworker of Aegina. He was officially recognized as a saint by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1961. His feast day is celebrated every year on 9 November.  Life  Saint Nektarios Silivri, Istanbul, Turkey Anastasios Kephalas, later Nectarios, was born on 1 October 1846 in Selymbria (today Silivri, Istanbul) in the Ottoman Empire to a poor family. His parents, Dimos and Maria Kephalas, were pious Christians but not wealthy. Also known as Nektarios of Egina, he was baptized as \\"Anastasios\\" (Kephalas). At the age of 14, he moved to Constantinople (Istanbul) to work and further his education. In 1866, at age 20, he moved to the island of Chios to take a teaching post. On November 7, 1876, he became a monk, at age 30, in the Monastery of Nea Moni, for he had long wished to embrace the ascetic life. Three years after becoming a monk he was ordained a deacon, taking the name Nectarios. He graduated from the University of Athens in 1885. During his years as a student of the University of Athens he wrote many books, pamphlets, and Bible commentaries. Following his graduation he went to Alexandria, Egypt, where he was ordained a priest and served the Church of Saint Nicholas in Cairo. He was consecrated Metropolitan bishop of Pentapolis (an ancient diocese in Cyrenaica, in what is now Libya) by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Sophronios in 1889. He served as a bishop in Cairo for one year. Nectarios was very popular with the people, which gave rise to jealousy among his colleagues. They were able to persuade his superior that Nectarios had ambitions to displace the Patriarch. Nectarios was suspended from his post without explanation.\\"The Life of St. Nectarios\\", St. Nectarios Greek Orthodox Church, Brooklyn, New York He then returned to Greece in 1891, and spent several years as a preacher (1891‚Äì1894). He was then director of the Rizarios Ecclesiastical School for the education of priests in Athens for fifteen years. He developed many courses of study, and wrote numerous books, while preaching widely throughout Athens. In 1904, at the request of several nuns, he established Holy Trinity Monastery for them on the island of Aegina. Nectarios ordained two women as deaconesses in 1911. Up to the 1950s, a few Greek Orthodox nuns also became monastic deaconesses. In 1986, Christodoulos, the metropolitan of Demetrias and later archbishop of Athens and all of Greece, ordained a woman deacon in accordance with the \\"ritual of St. Nektarios\\" (the ancient Byzantine text Nectarios had used). In December 1908, at the age of 62, Nectarios resigned from his post as school director and withdrew to the Holy Trinity Convent on Aegina, where he lived out the rest of his life as a monk. He wrote, published, preached, and heard confessions. He also tended the gardens, carried stones, and helped with the construction of the monastery buildings that were built with his own funds. Nectarios died on November 8, 1920, at the age of 74, following hospitalization for prostate cancer and two months of treatment. His body was taken to the Holy Trinity Convent, where he was buried by his best friend Savvas of Kalymnos, who later painted the first icon of Nectarios. The funeral of Nectarios was attended by multitudes of people from all parts of Greece and Egypt. Veneration The relics of Nectarios were removed from the grave on 2 September 1953. Official recognition of Nectarios as a saint by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople took place on 20 April 1961. The feast day of Nectarios is celebrated every year on 9 November.

Early life Bellos was born in London to a Polish Jewish mother, Renee Sackman, and a black Nigerian father, Emmanuel Adebowale, who came from Uzebba and joined the merchant navy during the Second World War. Raised in Brixton, Bellos was educated at Silverthorne Girls' Secondary Modern School, Dick Sheppard Comprehensive School, and the University of Sussex (1978‚Äì81).Linda Bellos: Education at LinkedIn. Career =Feminism= Bellos is a radical feminist and was the first non-white lesbian to join the Spare Rib feminist collective in 1981. She criticises the movement's \\"point scoring\\" and the manner in which the women's movement was, in her view, dominated by white, middle-class women. She rejects the term \\"mixed race\\" because she considers that every attempt to define race is reduced to definitions of skin colour. She uses the term \\"mixed heritage\\" instead. Bellos is a person of African and Eastern European Jewish heritage. She uses the inclusive political term of \\"Black\\" to describe herself. =Politics= She was vice-chair of the successful Labour Party Black Sections campaign to select African, Caribbean and Asian parliamentary and local candidates within the Labour Party. In 1985 Bellos was elected as a Labour councillor to Lambeth London Borough Council and was leader of the council between 1986 and 1988. She was the second Black woman to become leader of a British local authority, after Merle Amory in the northwest London Borough of Brent. Bellos resigned as leader on 21 April 1988, after disputes within the Labour Party over the setting of the council budget. She was a prominent figure in left-wing politics in London in the 1980s and was labelled by The Sun as a member of the \\"Loony Left\\". Bellos attempted to become a parliamentary candidate, without success, most notably for Vauxhall, south London, in the Lambeth borough, where there was a by-election in 1989, following the resignation of Stuart Holland MP. Fellow Black Sections vice- chair Martha Osamor was chosen by the local party to be the prospective parliamentary candidate but she was rejected as too left-wing by Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who got Kate Hoey imposed by the national party. Bellos was the treasurer of the Africa Reparations Movement (UK). She was co-chair of the Southwark LGBT Network until February 2007 and an adviser to Southwark Council. From 2000 to 2003, she was co-chair of the LGBT Advisory Group to the Metropolitan Police. She remains a community activist. =Equality= As a lesbian feminist, Bellos argued strongly in the early 1980s that an inclusive approach to women's issues must take account of social class, minority and majority ethnic identity, disability, sexual identity and religion. This approach was unpopular at the time but has since become accepted as equality law and social attitudes have changed. No longer regarded as \\"loony left\\", Bellos now teaches employers and their staff to apply the Equality Act 2010, the Human Rights Act 1998 and other equality law. She notably originated Black History Month in the UK whilst chair of the London Strategic Policy Unit. Bellos has worked on mainstreaming equality within many public bodies, including the British Army and the Metropolitan Police Service. She was an Independent Advisor to the Metropolitan Police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the Association of Chief Police Officers. She is a founder member and former Chair of The Institute of Equality and Diversity Practitioners. =Consulting= Bellos provides equality, diversity and human rights consultancy and training services to the UK's commercial, public and not-for- profit sectors. Her company is called Linda Bellos Associates. =Radio, TV, and writing= Bellos is a regular guest on radio and television programmes, contributing to discussions on many topics including equality, human rights and feminism. As an author, she has contributed to a number of anthologies, including IC3: The Penguin Book of New Black Writing in Britain. Personal life In 1970 she married Jonathan Bellos, they had two children, in 1974 and 1976. She came out as a lesbian in 1980, and her marriage ended in divorce in 1983. Linda left her children to live in an all-female commune. On 21 December 2005, Bellos and her partner, Caroline Jones, entered into a civil partnership in the UK. She currently resides in Norwich, England. Awards On 9 December 2002, she was presented (together with Stephen Bourne) with the Metropolitan Police Volunteer Awards \\"in recognition of outstanding contribution in supporting the local community.\\" In 2006, she was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours for services to diversity. She was reticent about receiving the award because she considers its association with a defunct Empire as outdated and the Honour should be renamed. She was encouraged to accept it by her family.

Rural communities are suffering from colossal market failures as the national grids fall short of their demand for electricity. As of 2017, over 1 billion people worldwide lack household electric power ‚Äì 14% of the global population. Electrification typically begins in cities and towns and gradually extends to rural areas, however, this process often runs into obstacles in developing nations. Expanding the national grid is expensive and countries consistently lack the capital to grow their current infrastructure. Additionally, amortizing capital costs to reduce the unit cost of each hook-up is harder to do in lightly populated areas (yielding higher per capita share of the expense). If countries are able to overcome these obstacles and reach nationwide electrification, rural communities will be able to reap considerable amounts of economic and social development. This graph shows the world rural electrification rate along with the electrification growth rate from 1990-2016 and synthesizes data from the World Bank Social and economic benefits =Education= Access to electricity facilitates sustainable economic and social growth. First, through an increase in educational achievement. Students who were previously forced to study when the sun was shining are now able to study by the light of LEDs early in the morning or late into the night. In Kenya for example, interviews with school teachers revealed that access to light has allowed for extra hours of teaching earlier and later in the day to cover material not adequately reviewed during normal hours. Additionally, schools with access to electricity are able to recruit higher quality teachers and have seen improvements on test scores and graduation rates, raising the human capital entering the labor force in the future. =Productivity and efficiency= In addition to improved education, rural electrification also allows for greater efficiency and productivity. Businesses will be able to keep their doors open for longer and generate additional revenues. Farmers will have access to streamlined modern techniques such as irrigation, crop processing, and food preservation. In 2014, rural communities in India gained more than US$21 million from increased economic activity driven by recent additions of electricity. Rural Electrification Administration lineman at work in Missouri, United States in 1942 =Job creation= When expanding the electrical grid, there is a demand for thousands of jobs ranging from business development to construction. Projects to spread electricity create a wealth of job opportunities and help to alleviate poverty. For example, India set a target of 175GW of clean energy to be installed by 2022 to increase electrification throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 jobs will need to be created in order to reach these lofty goals. =Healthcare improvements= The availability of electricity can drastically increase the quality of healthcare provided. Improved lighting increases the time patients can come and get treatment. Refrigerators can be used to conserve incredibly valuable vaccines and blood. Sterilization measures will be improved and the implementation of high tech machines such as x-rays or ultrasound scanners can provide doctors and nurses the tools they need to perform. In Diara Rhashalpool, a cluster of villages on the river Ganges, 140 households are without power. The locals are forced to travel 2‚Äì3 hours across the river for treatment or access to vaccines. With access to electricity, treatment would be far more accessible to the local population. =Additional benefits= * Reduce isolation and marginalization through telephone lines and Television * Improve safety with the implementation of street lighting, lit road signs. * Reduce expenses on expensive fossil fuel lamps i.e. kerosene Technology Renewable off-grid enterprises have emerged in many areas to meet the demand for electricity in rural communities. Due to their geographical location and relatively low aggregate demand, expanding the nationwide grid to rural areas is expensive and challenging. Renewable energy based mini grids are less dependent on larger-scale infrastructure and can be implemented faster and cheaper. Where an electric power distribution grid can be set up single wire earth return is often used. The following technologies are used extensively: * Photovoltaics * Wind mechanical water pumps * Small wind electric * Diesel solar hybrid power systems: especially for telecommunications worldwide. Fully commercial and the preferred option for remote telecommunications, commercially evolving for village power. * Bioenergy * Micro hydro is very widely implemented in Nepal, Vietnam, and China. * Hybrid power is also widely used where a number of different technologies are combined to provide a single power source. Challenges Researches Almeshqab F, Ustun TS (2019), \\"Lessons learned from rural electrification initiatives in developing countries: Insights for technical, social, financial and public policy aspects\\", Renew. Sustain. Energy Rev., Vol. 102, pp. 35-53. Peters J, Sievert M, Toman M (2019), \\"Rural electrification through mini-grids: Challenges ahead\\", Energy Policy, Vol. 132, pp. 27-31. pointed out that while many supportive policies have been put in place, cost for providing electricity to remote villages remains high. Furthermore, both energy resources and demand in these areas can be very volatile, making it difficult to plan appropriately. Another issue is that village location was determined historically based on soil, water, storage, etc., and might not be optimal for renewable energy generation. To mitigate these issues, the Networked Rural Electrification Model Li, Jerry and Zimmerle, Daniel (2019), \\"Designing Optimal Network for Rural Electrification using Multiplier-accelerated A* Algorithm\\", 2019 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC), Macao, Macao, 2019, pp. 1-5. Accepted version of this paper is available at Researchgate or the author's personal page has been proposed. In this model, villages in a selected area are linked up via an optimal network, which in turn connects to a few centralized generation facilities located at spots with better renewable energy resources. As such, each village is partially supplied by small local facility, and partially by the centralized facilities. This improves energy resources utilization as well as overall system flexibility and reliability. Viability of this model depends on the cost of building the optimal network. Based on multiplier-accelerated A* algorithm, the researchers have devised an effective method for evaluating all possible connections under complex geographical structure and hence practically optimize network design. Economic justification follows. National initiatives by continent =Africa= Senegal Senegal's electricity sector was reformed in 1998. Since then the country has implemented several electrification initiatives: *A national Senegalese Rural Electrification Action Plan (Plan d'Action S√©n√©galais d'√âlectrification Rurale), designed to increase private sector participation in rural electrification (details below); *Covenants and an Emergency Programme (Programme d'Urgence d'√âlectrification Rurale), both led and funded largely by the Government of Senegal; *Individual projects led by NGOs and private companies.Mawhood, R. and Gross, R. (2014) \\"Institutional barriers to a 'perfect' policy: A case study of the Senegalese Rural Electrification Plan\\", Energy Policy, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2014.05.047. Retrieved 24 June 2014. The Senegalese Rural Electrification Action Plan was launched in 2002 with the aim of maximising investment from the private sector. It raised an average of 49% private finance over 2002‚Äì2012, more than double the 22% global average for energy access projects.IEA (2011) \\"World Energy Outlook 2011\\" Retrieved 24 June 2014. However, during the same period it directly increased rural electrification levels by less than 1%. Analysis by Mawhood and Gross (2014) indicates that the Action Plan has faced considerable political and institutional barriers, notably institutional opposition, wavering ministerial support and lengthy stakeholder negotiations, as well as the inherent difficulties of implementing an innovative policy framework.Mawhood, B. and Gross, R. (2015) \\"Are Private Markets Effective for Rural Electrification?\\", The Energy Collective. Retrieved 14 January 2015. Although the Action Plan has been very successful at attracting private finance, the political/institutional challenges it has faced reflect the experiences of reform-based electrification schemes across Sub-Saharan Africa. This highlights the importance of designing initiatives to fit the local policy environment. =Americas= Brazil In 1981, 74.9% of Brazilian households were served by electric power, according to the IBGE's National Sample Survey of Households (PNAD). In 2000, the Federal government of Brazil, under the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, launched the Luz no Campo program to expand the distribution of electricity in Brazilian domiciles, with a focus on rural households. From 2003 on, the program was reinforced and renamed Luz para Todos by the Lula administration. The results were that, according to the PNAD, by 1996, 79.9% of all households had access to an electric power supply and that proportion rose to 90.8% in 2002 and 98.9% in 2009. United States of America In 1892, Guy Beardslee, the original owner of Beardslee Castle, was paid $40,000 to provide hydroelectric power to East Creek in New York. Despite widespread electricity in cities, by the 1920s electricity was not delivered by power companies to rural areas because of the general belief that the infrastructure costs would not be recouped. In sparsely-populated farmland, there were far fewer houses per mile of installed electric lines. A Minnesota state committee was organized to carry out a study of the costs and benefits of rural electrification.http://www.bbe.umn.edu/The_Red_Wing_Project.html The University of Minnesota Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, working jointly with Northern States Power Company (NSP, now Xcel Energy), conducted an experiment, providing electricity to nine farms in the Red Wing area. Electricity was first delivered on December 24, 1923.http://www.asabe.org/awards/historic2/53.html The \\"Red Wing Project\\" was successful ‚Äì the power company and the University concluded that rural electrification was economically feasible. The results of the report were influential in the National government's decision to support rural electrification. Before 1936, a small but growing number of farms installed small wind-electric plants. These generally used a 40V DC generator to charge batteries in the barn or the basement of the farmhouse. This was enough to provide lighting, washing machines and some limited well-pumping or refrigeration. Wind-electric plants were used mostly on the Great Plains, which have usable winds on most days. In 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority was created, in part, to provide rural electrification in the Tennessee Valley and surrounding areas. TVA created the generation and wholesale transmission capabilities that enabled rural distribution systems through electric cooperatives. Of the 6.3 million farms in the United States in January 1925, only 205,000 were receiving centralized electric services.Beall, Robert T. (1940). \\"Rural Electrification.\\" United States Yearbook of Agriculture. Washington, DC: United States Department of Agriculture. pp. 790‚Äì809. Retrieved December 30, 2008. The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was created by executive order as an independent federal bureau in 1935, authorized by the United States Congress in the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, and later in 1939, reorganized as a division of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. It was charged with administering loan programs for electrification and telephone service in rural areas. Between 1935 and 1939 ‚Äì or the first 4¬Ω years after REA's establishment, the number of farms using electric services more than doubled. The REA undertook to provide farms with inexpensive electric lighting and power. To implement those goals the administration made long-term, self-liquidating loans to state and local governments, to farmers' cooperatives, and to nonprofit organizations; no loans were made directly to consumers. In 1949 the REA was authorized to make loans for telephone improvements; in 1988, REA was permitted to give interest- free loans for job creation and rural electric systems. By the early 1970s about 98% of all farms in the United States had electric service, a demonstration of REA's success. In 1994 the administration was reorganized into the Rural Utilities Service by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 and the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994. In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would spend $398.5 million in infrastructure projects, by way of loans, that seek to improve electricity service in rural areas. The program is called the Electric Infrastructure Loan Program. Of the $398.5 million, $43 million will be to invest in smart grid technology. According to Smart Cities Dive, \\"The largest loan will send $68.5 million to back a solar farm run by NextEra Energy Resources in Arkansas, which could meet the needs of 21,000 homes.\\" The loans will go to projects in 13 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. Jamaica The Rural Electrification Programme (REP) was incorporated in 1975 with the specific mandate to expand the reach of electricity supply to rural areas, where the provision of such services would not be economically viable for commercial providers of electricity. The REP extends the national grid through the construction of electrical distribution pole lines to un-electrified areas and provides house wiring assistance through a loan programme to householders. In June 2012 Energy Minister Phillip Paulwell disclosed that, approximately 16,000 homes in remote parts of the island which do not have electricity are to be supplied with solar or wind electricity through the Rural Electrification Programme (REP). At a USAID-funded Analysis and Investigation for Low Emission (AILEG) project symposium, held at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel, on Tuesday, July 9, 2013, Energy Minister Phillip Paulwell stated that the REP has also been mandated to complete its target of providing electricity to 100 per cent of rural areas. \\"Those three per cent that now remain are in areas that are so far from the grid, it is too expensive (to provide), and we are going to be deploying photovoltaic systems in these areas,\\" he explained. In March 2015 he told a newspaper that, by 2017, \\"we should no longer have REP in the way we do now\\", adding that if the Government finds it too challenging to run power lines into communities, it will use solar.\\" See Also Solar Power in Jamaica =Asia= China By 2015, 100 percent of Chinese people had access to electric power. http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/news/presentations/bazilian.pdf In the early 1990s the countryside of China still suffered from extreme energy poverty; more than 40 percent of rural Chinese had no access to power or electric lighting at all, depending instead on kerosene lamps for lighting. In the early 1990s the average use of power in the countryside amounted to the equivalent of a 60W light bulb switched on for less than 30 minutes a day. China launched the China Township Electrification Program in 2001 to provide renewable electricity to 1,000 townships, one of the largest of such programs in the world. This was followed by the China Village Electrification Program, also using renewable energy, aimed at the electrification of a further 3.5 million households in 10,000 villages by 2010, to be followed by full rural electrification by 2015.Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update , REN21, published 2006, accessed 2007-05-16 In December 2015, China brought the last 39,800 Chinese onto the national electric grid by spending $324 million and using over 5,000 workers to wire 2 extremely remote villages in Quighai province located at altitudes of 13,100 ft. India Currently, all the villages in India have been electrified w.e.f. 29 April 2018 but it doesn't mean that all households are electrified. By India's own set standards, only 10% of households in a village must have electricity for it to be considered electrified. As of August 2018, 91% of the total households are electrified in India. Rural areas in India are electrified non-uniformly, with richer states being able to provide a majority of the villages with power while poorer states still struggling to do so. The Rural Electrification Corporation Limited was formed to specifically address the issue of providing electricity in all the villages across the country. Poverty, lack of resources, lack of political will, poor planning, and electricity theft are some of the major causes which have left many villages in India without electricity, while urban areas have enjoyed growth in electricity consumption and capacity. In order to drastically increase electrification rates, the Indian Government has set the target of 175GW of installed renewable energy by 2022 and mandated the electrification of over 18,000 villages. At the end of 2016, India had around 45.6GW of installed renewable energy with a vast amount of work and investment required to meet their lofty targets. The central government is increasingly trying to improve the dire conditions by investing heavily in biogas, solar as well as wind energy. Programs such as The JNN solar mission, and Pradhan Mantri Gram Vidyut Yojana is also known as the Saubhagya Scheme have been announced to fasten the pace of electrification and diversify the procedure. The work is also on-going for reducing wastage, providing better equipment and improving the overall infrastructure for electrical transmissions in villages. =Europe= Ireland During the 1930s most towns in Ireland were connected to the national grid. The outbreak of World War II in Europe lead to shortages of fuel and materials and the electrification process was brought to a virtual halt. In the early 1950s the Rural Electrification scheme gradually brought electric power to the countryside, a process that was completed on the mainland in 1973 (although it wasn't until 2003 that the last of the inhabited offshore islands were fully connected). Currently the Rural Electrification scheme continues, but is primarily concerned with upgrading the quality of the network (voltage fluctuations are still a problem in parts of Ireland ‚Äì particularly in rural areas) and making three phase supplies available to larger farms and rural businesses requiring it. Successful examples =Gram Oorja= Like many other microgrid companies, Gram Oorja has set out to provide electricity to the millions who lack access to power in rural India. Gram Oorja created a model based upon ‚Äúcorporate-social partnership‚Äù and gains funding from corporate charity funds. Their first project was in Darewadi, a rural village with 39 households. Gram Oorja raised funding from Bosch Solar Energy and received consultation and guidance from the Shakti Foundation. They installed a solar power plant capable of producing 9.4 kilowatts of power with a backup biogas unit to produce energy when sunlight is not available. Local ownership of the project is one of the key tenets of Gram Oorja's business model, so they encouraged participation in the set up and management of the mini-grid. A village trust collects bills every month and deposits the revenue into a corpus fund. This hybrid model proved to be successful and has been implemented in over 10 villages. Gram Oorja currently has an installed capacity of 45.7 kW and serves 230 households. They have also partnered with Bank of America to continue to implement these projects across India. =G.R.I.D. (Grassroots and Rural Innovative Development)= GRID is an Indian start-up aimed at facilitating sustainable economic and social development through low cost energy solutions in rural areas. Outside of microgrid systems, GRID has utilized solar energy to solve a myriad of issues that plague rural communities. For example, Grid has setup solar powered reverse osmosis filtration plants in rural India to help eliminate water insecurity. Only 18% of India's rural population have access to treated tap water, forcing locals to rely on unsafe groundwater. GRID's filtration plant is able to provide 20,000 to 30,000 liters of clean water per day which helps to alleviate this issue and reduce the spread of water-borne illness. Additionally, the ease of distribution has reduced the amount of time spent collecting water, allowing for more time on productive tasks and a reduction in time poverty. Finally, GRID employs locals in the community to run the plants day to day operations. From the ground up, GRID's business model fosters the development of rural communities and they plan to scale their operations across India.

Women-only passenger cars are railway or subway cars intended for women only. They are a result of sexual segregation in some societies, but also can result from attempts to reduce sexual harassment such as groping.  Africa  =Egypt= On all Cairo Metro trains, the middle two cars (4th and 5th) of each train are reserved for women (the 5th car becomes a mixed use after 21:00). These cars are used as an option for women who do not wish to ride with men in the same car; however, women can still ride other cars freely. This policy was introduced for protection of women from sexual harassment by men.  Americas  =Brazil= A women-only subway car at Rio de Janeiro Metro. In April 2006, the Rio de Janeiro Metro implemented the mandate established by state law. It was passed in the previous month to have dedicated passenger cars for women to avoid sexual harassment. For trains with six passenger cars, one subway car is marked with pink colors as exclusive for women, and the women-only restriction applies from Monday through Friday during the rush hours, between 6:00 and 9:00 and between 17:00 and 20:00. There is metro police enforcement to prevent men from boarding the dedicated passenger car, and the platform has a sign on the floor indicating the boarding point for women-only cars. A similar policy was implemented at S√£o Paulo Metro between October 1995 and September 1997, but the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) decided not to continue after some complaints by married couples and to avoid any possible contravention of article 5 of the Brazilian Constitution, that guarantees equality among citizens. = Mexico = Women-only buses were implemented in Mexico City in 2008. The Mexico City Metro has women only cars. Mexico city also has women- only taxi's and buses called the \\"pink line\\"  Asia  =Japan= Current practice \\"Woman Only\\" sign inside Tokyo Metro carriage Passengers waiting to board a women-only car on the Keio Line at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo Sign next to door of coach In Japan, women-only cars were introduced to combat lewd conduct, particularly groping (chikan). Women-only policies vary from company to company: some are in effect during rush hour, others throughout the day, while some limit women-only cars to rapid service trains, as they tend to be more crowded and have relatively longer distances between stops. But in general, the policy is effective only on weekdays, excluding holidays. Platforms and train doors are marked with signs indicating boarding areas for the cars, and the days and times when the cars are women- only. Though intended to be exclusive to women, most train operators in Japan allow male elementary school pupils, disabled persons, and their assistants to board women-only cars. Groping in crowded trains has been a problem in Japan: according to National Police Agency and Ministry of Justice, the number of reported indecent assault in subway carriages in nationwide Japan between 2005 and 2014 ranges from 283 to 497 cases each year. The police and railway companies responded with poster campaigns to raise awareness and with tougher sentences, but have been unable to reverse the trend. In 2004, the Tokyo police reported a threefold increase in reported cases of groping on public transportation over eight years. In December 2000, Keio Electric Railway, which operates trains between Tokyo and its suburbs, offered women-only cars late at night on a trial basis, in response to complaints about groping by drunken men during the b≈çnenkai party season. Keio began running trains with late-night women-only cars on a full-time basis in March 2001. In July 2001, JR East began a similar service on the Saikyo Line, which connects Tokyo with Saitama Prefecture and had become notorious for gropers because of crowding and longer distances between stops. The following year, the service was extended to evening rush hour. In July 2002, JR West became the third company in Japan to run trains with women-only cars, and the JR West trains in Osaka became the first to offer women-only cars during morning rush hour. The same year, two more Osaka-area railways, Hankyu Railway and Keihan Railway, added women-only cars to their limited express trains, and Hankyu became the first company to run women-only cars all day long. Other Osaka-area companies followed suit, including Osaka Municipal Subway, whose Midosuji Line, which carries passengers at as much as 160% capacity, had a reputation for having the worst groping problem in all of Japan. Tokyo-area companies resisted the change because of logistical difficulties and fear of overcrowding in mixed- gender cars, but in 2005 they introduced women-only cars during rush hour, after awareness campaigns and tougher sentencing proved ineffective. Women- only cars have received positive reactions from some men and some women. Women cited safety from gropers, as well as not having to tolerate various smells. Men cited not having to worry about false accusations of being a groper. However, passengers complained about further overcrowding in mixed cars, and feared that women who ride mixed cars would be putting themselves at more risk than before. Visually-impaired men have been reported to unknowingly enter a women-only car and to be warned by other passengers, facing serious embarrassment. Japanese legislation from 1900 provides for a 10 yen fine for male passengers who enter a female-only railway car or waiting room; this law is technically still in effect, but the Japanese government has opined that it would not apply to the \\"women only\\" cars that are currently in use, making compliance with the \\"women only\\" rule voluntary from a legal perspective. Historical practice Signage previously used on the Chuo Main Line The earliest instance of women-only cars in Japan was in 1912 on the present day Chuo Main Line, when they were introduced during rush hours to separate male and female students. http://rail-j.com/esse/index.php?%BD%F7%C0%AD%C0%EC%CD%D1%BC%D6 Called \\"Flower Trains,\\" the service ended during World War II. Women-only streetcars were introduced in Kobe in 1920, and Hankyu Railway ran special trains for schoolgirls commuting between Kobe and Nishinomiya in the 1930s. Cars exclusively for women and children were introduced on the Chuo Main Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line in 1947, after the end of World War II. At the time, overcrowding on these lines during rush hours was so severe that women and children often could not physically board trains. The cars remained in use on morning inbound Chuo Main Line trains until 1973, when priority seating was introduced; they were retired from the Keihin-Tohoku Line at an earlier date. = United Arab Emirates = Every train on Dubai's metro system has one designated carriage which is only for women and children between 7:00 to 9:00 and 17:00 to 20:00 on weekdays. Men entering the carriage during these times are fined 100 UAE dirhams ($ USD). The women-only carriages used to be half a carriage with a demarcation line marking the divide between the normal space and the women-only space. Around 98 fines are issued every day regarding women-only carriages. = India = A women-only carriage in India Across India, all long distance train services have special compartments reserved for women only. In Mumbai, the commercial metropolis, all suburban commuter trains have compartments specially meant only for women, though children of school- going age are also allowed to travel. While two compartments are designated for 24 hours for women, one compartment is reserved for women during specified hours. The women compartments are provided for first as well as second class travel. Besides, Ladies Special trains have been introduced during peak hours where the entire train is reserved for women. There are three-four women specials during peak hours. With the number of women needing to travel doubling in 2000s, there is a very strong demand for these kinds of services. Many rail services offer women-only cars including, among others, the Mumbai metro and best buses special Delhi Metro. It has even given rise to a women- only taxi and rickshaw services. =Indonesia= An Indonesian railway company, PT Kereta Api, introduced women-only carriages on some KRL Jabotabek commuter trains in the Jakarta metropolitan area from August 2010 in response to many reports of sexual harassment in public places, including commuter trains and buses. The women-only carriages on commuter trains are usually denoted by large pink or purple stickers, which read \\"Kereta Khusus Wanita\\", and are located at each end of the train. This kind of carriage was previously only able to be found on air-conditioned EMUs, but a number of recently repaired non-air conditioned EMUs (series KL3 or K3) have also been equipped with the purple women-only carriage stickers. Now, the women-only carriage stickers in Jabodetabek EMUs has been removed from February 2016 until now, and only replaced with the pink women-only carriages signs. Recently, PT Kereta Api launched a special women-only train (the train itself uses an ex- Tokyo Metro 6000 series EMU, set number 6107F), which intended as further protection for women passengers from sexual harassments. To give difference from standard EMUs (which only provides women-only carriages on each end of the train), the women-only train had all of its cars decorated with large \\"Kereta Khusus Wanita\\" stickers colored purple or pink. Since October 1, 2012, PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero) Commuter Jabodetabek (now pt kereta commuter indonesia) launch the women-only trains. All of the coach of this train is only for women and men don't enter this trains. This service ended in May 2013 after reports found mixed-use cars were overcrowded during rush hour while women's only cars were underutilized.

Reactions from passengers were mixed. While some welcomed the measure as it made women feel safer, others thought that separating genders was \\"something from the past\\" and a \\"backward solution\\". =United Kingdom= Punch magazine published a cartoon by George du Maurier about Agnata Butler's examination success at Classical Studies. She was the only person in the first class of the Classical Tripos at Cambridge University that year, placing her above all the men. Here, Mr Punch (the magazine's mascot) ushers her into a first class compartment which is for ladies only. The last \\"Ladies Only\\" accommodation in British trains was withdrawn in 1977, due to a combination of different train types being introduced and equality legislation which prevented gender-specific provisions. On the old type of local trains, no longer operating, individual compartments of the traditional type were right across the carriage (typically 9 or so per carriage), with no corridor, bench seats for 5 or so on each side, and access only through many individual side doors. Because of concerns from individual women passengers who might be left with men in the compartment as passengers alighted, a few compartments (typically the end one in each train unit) were labelled as Ladies Only. At a time when No Smoking compartments were denoted by red window labels, and First Class by blue labels, the Ladies Only compartments were shown by green window labels. In September 2014, Parliamentary Under Secretary for transport Claire Perry MP mentioned a possible revival of the women-only carriages idea during a speech to a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference. In August 2015, Labour leadership candidate Jeremy Corbyn said he would consult on the option of introducing women-only carriages to help reduce harassment.

Name * According to the historian Radharaman Saha, Pabna is named after Paboni, a branch of the Ganges. * Archeologist Cunningham wrote that the name came from \\"Poth\\", a totem folk who lived long ago in this region (Poundrabardhan). A survey map from 10 depicts a Mouza (medium-size village) named Padeh Pabna in the Nazirpur Pargana (pargana can be considered as a cluster of villages). * Haraprasad Shastri, the author and historian, regarded the name Pabna as originating from Podubomba, a small feudal kingdom, which was established by a king named Shom, during the Pal Dynasty period. * Historian Durgadas Lahiri, in his book Prithibir Itihash, used a map from the ancient period where a village named Pabna can be seen. * A legend: There was a robber (like Robin Hood) named Pobana who lived here long ago. He became a legendary hero for his good deeds. People honoured him by giving his name to the river Pabna. * The name comes from the Persian word \\"Panmbah\\", which means cotton.

As a child, he was imprisoned in the Yodok concentration camp for 10 years. After his release he fled the country, first to China and eventually to South Korea. He is the author, with Pierre Rigoulot, of The Aquariums of Pyongyang and worked as a staff writer specialized in North Korean affairs for The Chosun Ilbo. He is the founder and president of the North Korea Strategy Center. Early life Kang meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in June 2005. Kang in 2008 According to his autobiography, Kang was born in Pyongyang, North Korea, and spent his childhood there. He had a good relationship with his grandfather. He had a happy childhood. His grandfather was the Vice President of the Commercial Management office in Pyongyang, supervising all the commercial stores and department stores in Pyongyang. His grandmother was a member of the Supreme People‚Äôs Assembly and was the deputy head of the Workers‚Äô Party organization of female members. She was deputy to Kim Il Sung‚Äôs wife. His family lived in relative luxury from his grandfather's position and the fortune that he had given to the country upon the family's return from Japan. Though they had never renounced their North Korean citizenship and Kang's grandmother had been a staunch party member in both countries, Kang has stated that the family remained under a cloud of suspicion for having lived in Japan. Concentration camp In 1977, his grandfather was accused of treason and was sent to the Senghori concentration camp. According to current KCNA, the elder Kang was an agent of the Japanese National Police. As the family of a traitor, Kang, 9, and his family were sent to the Yodok concentration camp. Kang's autobiography describes a brutal life in the camp. Death from starvation or exposure to the elements was common, with routine beatings and other punishments. His education consisted almost solely of memorizing the sayings and speeches of Kim Il-sung; at 15, his education ceased and he was assigned to exhausting and dangerous work details, and was made to view public executions. He said of the camps, \\"It was a life of hard labour, thirty percent of new prisoners would die. And we were so malnourished, we would eat rats and earthworms to survive.\\" There was an order by Kim Jong Il that those in the prison with relatives in Japan had to be released after 10 years. In the mid-1980s North Korea depended heavily on foreign currency remittances. Many Koreans living in Japan were sending remittances to North Korea. These people also protested the regime‚Äôs sending their relatives to prison. This had a bad effect on the public opinion and the amount of remittances being sent from Japan. If he didn‚Äôt have that connection, he probably never would have left that prison. Once he left the camp, he was sent to live in Yodok village. He could not go all the way back to Pyongyang, but he moved to Pyongsong, near Pyongyang. He moved in with his uncle who was working at the National Science Research Institute in the city. Release After release from the camp, Kang bought an illegal radio receiver and listened to broadcasts from South Korea. He was studying and preparing to go to college, but he and a friend had found interest in foreign broadcasting. He was quite interested in outside information and eventually got involved in anti-government activity. He was later identified and watched by the government; fearing he would be sent back to the concentration camp, he planned his escape. He was part of a group of people who were against the regime. He had access to foreign information and sang foreign songs. All of this was strictly prohibited in North Korea and he knew it could put his family at risk as well. When he was discovered, he knew he couldn‚Äôt discuss the matter with his family. So he left the country as soon as he could. In 1992, he and fellow Yodok internee An Hyuk escaped from North Korea by crossing the Yalu River into China. The hardest challenge for them was getting on the train to the border of China undetected. All of the North Korean trains were monitored by the authorities. To gain passage, they had to bribe the police to gain permission to travel. Eventually, they made it to the border city of Chanbai, China near Hyesan, North Korea, where they stayed temporarily, making numerous deals with the North Korean military there by buying them beer and drinks. Later, the North Korean military informed them there was a changing of the guard at 2 AM. An Hyuk and Kang took their chance and crossed the river into China without any complications. After they made it across, North Korean patrols came looking for them, searching for about a week. They hid in China for about 6 months and eventually made their way to Dalian, where some ethnic Koreans helped them get passage to South Korea. After publishing The Aquariums of Pyongyang, Kang met with US President George W. Bush and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. He has spoken with several organizations about human rights in North KoreaRepublicans Abroad Korea: Kang Chol-hwan reception a success and visited Japan for a discussion about abductees. Kang has not been in contact with his family since he defected. In 2011, it was revealed that his sister, Mi-ho, and her 11-year-old son are believed to be at Yodok concentration camp.http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/petition_to_unwgad.pdf Petition To: United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention  Bibliography  * * \\"Give Us An 'Eclipse Policy'\\", The Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2005.

Rowland (born May 22, 1974) is the author and artist responsible for Wigu and Overcompensating, two popular webcomics. Originally from Locust Grove, Oklahoma, Rowland now lives in Easthampton, Massachusetts where he continues to work on the two projects, while running TopatoCo, a company which sells merchandise based on his and other artists' comics. Jeffrey Rowland's comics are part of the TopatoCo network, along with comics such as Dinosaur Comics and MS Paint Adventures. Rowland can be considered one of the small number of professional webcartoonists, as running Overcompensating and Wigu, in addition to his merchandise company TopatoCo, is his full-time job and source of income. Comics Rowland's comics were used along with Penny Arcade, Fetus-X and Questionable Content as an example of comics using the web to create \\"an explosion of diverse genres and styles\\" in Scott McCloud's 2006 book Making Comics McCloud, Scott (2006). Making Comics, New York: Harper Collins Publishers. . p. 227 =When I Grow Up= When I Grow Up is a webcomic written by Rowland,When You‚Äôre Eight Years Old, Anything Seems Possible / An Interview with Jeffrey Rowland , Mike Meginnis, Webcomics Examiner, 2006-03-14Jeffrey Rowland, Web Cartoonist Matt Willemain, Stony Brook Independent, 2007-03-26 which ran from June 14, 1999 until January 1, 2002. It takes place in the fictional town of Shallow Brook, Oklahoma. The main characters were Neal, a young African American scientist working for the U.S. government; Roger, an unemployed slacker; Zoe, a selfish, bitter newscaster; and Gina, a college student and part-time employee of a video store. The structure of When I Grow Up is very similar that of Rowland's second comic, Wigu. It includes five different story arcs, which are often interrupted by short stories or single strips. When I Grow Up was hosted on Keenspot for some time, but Rowland eventually moved it to his own server. =Wigu= Wigu was a webcomic created by Jeffrey Rowland. It was publicly launched on January 7, 2002 and was also part of the Dumbrella bulletin board. Wigu is the successor to When I Grow Up and derives its name from the earlier strip's initials. There have been some guest appearances from When I Grow Up, but Wigu is otherwise a different comic with a new set of characters. The comic is centered on the adventures of a little boy named Wigu Tinkle and his family. Each chapter of the comic represents one day in Wigu's life. Wigu is an intelligent child with an active imagination who uses much of his free time to watch television and play video games, where he encounters the beings of Butter Dimension¬≥, primarily the intergalactic heroes Topato (a flying potato whose catchphrase is \\"Spring into action!\\" and whose primary defense mechanism consists of being made entirely of poison) and Sheriff Pony (an eloquent Space Pony who, as the storyline reveals, excretes vanilla ice cream instead of fecal waste. Topato excretes sour cream, which he also uses to shave). Wigu was nominated for the 2004 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards categories Outstanding Short Form Comic and Outstanding Story Concept.2004 Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards Wigu was originally intended to end on December 31, 2004, but resumed on April 18, 2005. The webcomic ended again on December 31, 2005 so that Rowland could continue the title as a series of printed books. It was intended that there be a new book every month, but due to various delays, only three have been published, and Wigu returned to its original online format on November 22, 2006. =Overcompensating= On September 19, 2004, Rowland began another comic, Overcompensating, a journal/daily blog comic about his life. Overcompensating, though clearly fictitious, does appear to have some reality in it. Caricatures of real life people such as Richard Stevens, John Allison and Vera BrosgolThe Underpants Candidate Overcompensating, May 06, 2005 make appearances, while other characters, such as Baby, do not exist.Overcompensating October 18, 2004 - \\"Down in the West Texas Town of El Paso\\" In April 2005, Rowland predicted and then 'faked' his death by having Weedmaster P, a character in the strip, update the comic, posting that Rowland had died. TopatoCo Rowland is the owner and operator of the web merchant TopatoCo, which sells T-shirts, stickers, magnets, comics, hoodies, tote bags, and other items for a number of webcomics. As of May 2012, TopatoCo sells merchandise for over 40 different comics. Comics that TopatoCo represents include Questionable Content, Dinosaur Comics, MS Paint Adventures, Wondermark, and Sam and Fuzzy. Rowland currently operates TopatoCo out of a large warehouse in Easthampton, Massachusetts. The various cardboard box- related adventures of running the business play a large part in Rowland's comic Overcompensating.

The business was established by Philip Vincent who bought an existing manufacturing name HRD, initially renaming it as Vincent HRD, producing his own motorcycles as HRD did previously with engines purchased as complete assemblies from other companies. From 1934, two new engines were developed as single cylinder in 500 cc and v-twin 1,000 cc capacities. Production grew from 1936, with the most-famous models being developed from the original designs after the War period in the late 1940s.Classic Bike, September 2002, The Vincent Story ‚Äì Timeline, by Dave Minton, pp.27‚Äì31 Accessed 17 September 2014 The 1948 Vincent Black Shadow was at the time the world's fastest production motorcycle. The name was changed to Vincent Engineers (Stevenage) Ltd. in 1952 after financial losses were experienced when releasing capital to produce a Vincent-engined prototype Indian (Vindian) for the US market during 1949. In 1955 the company discontinued motorcycle production after experiencing further heavy financial losses. History Vincent Motorcycles, \\"the makers of the world's fastest motorcycles\\", began with the purchase of HRD Motors Ltd less the factory premises, by Philip Vincent in May 1928. HRD was founded by the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) pilot, Howard Raymond Davies, who was shot down and captured by the Germans in 1917. Legend has it that it was while a prisoner of war that he conceived the idea of building his own motorcycle, and contemplated how he might achieve that. It was not until 1924 that Davies entered into partnership with E J Massey, trading as HRD Motors. Various models were produced, generally powered by J.A.P. engines. Unfortunately, although HRD motorcycles won races, the company ran at a loss. In January 1928 it went into voluntary liquidation. The company was initially bought by Ernest Humphries of OK-Supreme Motors for the factory space, and the HRD name, jigs, tools, patterns, and remaining components were subsequently offered for sale again. =Phil Vincent= Detail of Vincent cantilever suspension Philip Vincent was advised to start production under an established name. He had built a motorcycle of his own in 1927 and in 1928 had registered a patent for a cantilever rear suspension of his own design. With the backing of his family wealth from cattle ranching in Argentina, Vincent acquired the trademark, goodwill and remaining components of HRD from Humphries for ¬£450 in 1928. thumb The company was promptly renamed Vincent HRD Co., Ltd and production moved to Stevenage. The new trademark had The Vincent in very small letters above the large \\"HRD\\". After World War 2 Britain had an export drive to repay its war debts, and the USA was the largest market for motorcycles, so from 1950 the HRD was dropped from the name to avoid any confusion with the \\"HD\\" of Harley Davidson, and the motorcycle became the Vincent. In 1928 the first Vincent-HRD motorcycle used a JAP single-cylinder engine in a Vincent-designed cantilever frame. The earliest known example extant exists in Canberra, Australia. Some early bikes used Rudge-Python engines. But after a disastrous 1934 Isle of Man TT, with engine problems and all three entries failing to finish, Phil Vincent and Phil Irving decided to build their own engines. Phil Vincent also experimented with three-wheeled vehicles, amphibious vehicles, and automobiles. In 1932 the first 3-wheeler, \\"The Vincent Bantam\\" appeared, powered by a 293cc Villiers engine. It was a 2.5 cwt delivery van with a car seat and a steering wheel. The Bantam cost ¬£57-10-0 and the windscreen and hood option cost ¬£5-10-0. Production ceased in 1936. =Phil Irving= Vincent Comet from 1950 at the Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum In late 1931 Phil Irving first joined Vincent as an engineer alongside fellow-engineer E.J. Massey from the original HRD company after initially working on metallurgy for Velocette,Motorcycle Sport, July 1979, p.350 P. C. Vincent ‚Äì A tribute by R. R. H. (Robert 'Bob' Holliday, ex-editor of Motor Cycling) Accessed 26 September 2014 leaving to return to his native Australia in 1949. His first engine design was an OHV 500 cc single-cylinder engine in 1934 called the \\"Meteor\\". World War II In 1937 Phil Irving went to work for Velocette but returned to Vincent Motorcycles in 1943. Vincent primarily made munitions, but Vincent engines were trialled in boats and portable pumps during the war, and the end of hostilities saw Vincent ready to return to motorcycle production. Vincent developed a highly efficient opposed-piston two-stroke engine for use in air-dropped lifeboats, although development outlasted the war and it never went into service. Vincent already looked to the United States for sales, and in 1944 Eugene Aucott opened the first USA dealership in the city of Philadelphia. Others followed. Models =Meteor and Comet= Vincent HRD The standard motor was known as the Meteor and the sports motor was the Comet; it was distinguished from earlier Vincent models of that name by the \\"Series-A\\" prefix. There was a TT replica & the Comet Special (basically a TTR with lights, horn etc.), which used a bronze head. The Meteor motor produced @ 5300 rpm. An unusual feature of the valve design for these motors was the double valve guides, and the attachment of the forked rocker arm to a shoulder between the guides, to eliminate side forces on the valve stem and ensure maximum valve life under racing conditions. The Series-A Comet could do , but Phil Vincent and his racing customers wanted more. =1936 Series A Rapide= Vincent Series 'A' Rapide Whilst working in his office at Stevenage in 1936, Phil Irving noticed that two drawings of the Vincent HRD engine lay on top of each other in a \\"V\\" formation. He set them out on the drawing board as a v-twin engine in a frame Vincents had made for a record attempt by Eric Fernihough, who no longer required it. When Phil Vincent saw the drawing he was immediately enthusiastic, and a few weeks later the first Vincent thousand had been made, with Meteor upper engine parts mounted on new crankcases. The Vincent V-twin motorcycle incorporated a number of new and innovative ideas, some of which were more successful than others. The Vincent HRD Series A Rapide was introduced in October 1936. Its frame was of brazed lug construction, based on the Comet design but extended to accommodate the longer V twin engine. It continued the use of \\"cantilever\\" rear suspension, which was used on all Vincents produced from 1928 until 1955. Other innovations included a side stand. Innovative telescopic forks were not adopted by Vincent, with both Phils believing girder forks were superior at the time and beyond. The Series-A had external oil lines ‚Äì known as \\"the plumber's nightmare\\" ‚Äì and a separate gearbox.Wilson, Hugo. (1993) The Ultimate Motor-Cycle Book p.82 Vincent HRD \\"The pre-war bikes were nicknamed 'the plumber's nightmare' due to their confusion of external oil pipes.\\" Dorling Kindersley Accessed 17 July 2014 With 6.8:1 compression ratio, the 998 cc Series A Rapide Vincent produced , and was capable of . The high power meant that the Burman clutch and gearbox transmission did not cope well.Motorcycle Sport, July 1979, p.350 P.C.Vincent ‚Äì A tribute by R.R.H. (Robert 'Bob' Holliday, ex-editor of Motor Cycling) Accessed 23 June 2014 =1946 Series B Rapide= The Series B Rapide designed during the war and released to the press before end of hostilities looked radically different from the A. The oil pipes were now internal. Unit construction allowed Vincent to combine the engine and gearbox into a single casing. Philip Vincent summarised his frame design philosophy in his memoirs, writing \\"What isn't present takes up no space, cannot bend, and weighs nothing ‚Äî so eliminate the frame tubes!\\" The angle between the cylinders was changed to 50¬∞ from the 47.5¬∞ of the Series A engine to allow the engine to be installed as a stressed member. This enabled Vincent to reduce the frame to an upper frame member (UFM) that was a steel box-section backbone that doubled as an oil tank, and to which the front headlug and rear suspension were attached. Brakes were dual single-leading shoe (SLS), front and rear. The wheelbase was shorter than the Series A, and its dimensions were closer to contemporary 500 cc bikes. The Series B had a Feridax Dunlopillo Dualseat, and a tool tray under the front. The Series \\"B\\" incorporated an internal felt oil filter instead of the metal gauze of the Series \\"A\\". Vincent used quickly detachable wheels, making wheel and tyre changes easier. The rear wheel was reversible, and different size rear sprockets could be fitted for quick final-drive ratio changes. The brake & gear shift were adjustable for reach to suit individual feet. The rear mud guard was hinged to facilitate the removal of the rear wheel. From today's perspective, it seems incongruous that Vincent could see the need for, and design, a cantilever rear suspension, as well as incorporate so many other new ideas, yet use Brampton girder forks with friction dampers up front. The two Phils felt that the telescopic forks of the time were prone to lateral flex, so they persisted with girder forks, and did use hydraulic damping in the Series C \\"Girdraulic\\" forks. Starting in 1948, Indian Motorcycles distributed Vincents in the United States along with other British motorcycles including AJS, Royal Enfield, Matchless and Norton. That same year an Indian Chief was sent to Stevenage to be fitted with a Vincent Rapide engine. The resulting hybrid Vindian did not go into production. =1948 Series C Vincents= Black Shadow and Black Lightning Zweirad-Museum Neckarsulm The 1948 Series C Rapide differed from the Series B in having \\"Girdraulic\\" front forks ‚Äì which were girder forks with hydraulic damping. By 1950, the Series C had a 998 cc, 50¬∞ V-twin that put out , depending on the state of tune, either Rapide or Black Shadow. The Black Shadow, capable of , and easily recognised by the black coating on the engine and gearbox unit known as Pylumin,Classic Bike, September 2002, p.73 Accessed 16 September 2014 and large speedometer, was introduced. The engine produced @ 5700 rpm in Black Shadow trim. The Black Lightning was a racing version of the Black Shadow; every necessary steel part on it that could be was remade in aluminium, and anything not essential was removed altogether. These changes helped reduce the weight from to . Every bit the racer, it had a single racing seat and rear-set footrests. Rollie Free during his US record breaking run in 1948 Rolland \\"Rollie\\" Free (18 November 1900 ‚Äì 11 October 1984) was a motorcycle racer best known for breaking the US motorcycle land speed record in 1948 on the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah on a Vincent Black Lightning. The picture of Free, prone and wearing a bathing suit, has been described as the most famous picture in motorcycling, and Russell Wright won another World Land Speed Record at Swannanoa with a Vincent HRD motorcycle in 1955 at . The 500 cc Meteor and Comet singles were introduced, along with a 500 cc racer, the Vincent Grey Flash. The Grey Flash racer used Albion gears, for the greater choice of ratios available. The 500 cc bikes used a wet multiplate clutch, while the 998 cc V-twins used a dry, drum-type servo clutch. Most Vincents had black tanks and frames. In 1949 a White Shadow (a machine to Black Shadow mechanical specification, but with silver engine casings) was available, but only 15 were sold, and the option was dropped in 1952. In 1950 16 Red Comets were shipped to the United States. There were also 31 of the 1948 Grey Flash built. During the Korean War nickel chrome steel was officially regulated, meaning the correct materials for some components (e.g. gears) was not available. Some motorcycles built during this period had black rims. From 1950, HRD was dropped from the name, and the logo now simply read The Vincent.Classic Bike, September 2002, The Vincent Story ‚Äì Timeline, by Dave Minton. \\"1949.

Additional new models were created introduced by fitting some machines with a fibreglass handlebar fairing having a tall screen and matching front legshields and long side enclosures, creating streamlining to improve rider comfort. Named Victor (based on the Comet), Black Knight (based on the Rapide) and Black Prince (based on the Shadow), they were poorly received by the public and suffered delays in production when waiting for the new bodywork to be supplied with an acceptable paint finish.Shaping the Future, Part 2.

All motorcycle production ceased in December 1955. =Fireflys, three wheelers, and NSU= The Firefly was a 45 cc \\"clip on\\" engined bicycle built from 1953 to 1955 under licence from Miller, who were suppliers of electrical components to Vincent. It was also known as the Vincent Power Cycle. By 1954, Vincent Motorcycles was in an increasingly difficult situation. In the quest for solvency, Vincent looked for ways to improve their position. The trike idea was revived. In 1932 \\"The Vincent Bantam\\" was first introduced: Vincent's first 3-wheeler, powered by a 293 cc SV JAP or 250 cc Villiers engine, was a 2.5 cwt delivery van which used a car seat and steering wheel rather than the standard motorcycle saddle and handlebars. The Bantam was priced at ¬£57-10-0 with a windscreen and hood available for an additional ¬£5-10-0. It ceased production in 1936 ‚Äì the first year of the Series A motorcycle. NSU-Vincent Fox In 1954/1955, due to falling sales of motorcycles, the prototype 3-wheeler powered by a Vincent Rapide 998 cc engine was produced. Some years later, the vehicle was named \\"Polyphemus\\" by its owner, Roy Harper. To keep development and production costs low, it used a parts-bin approach, including pieces from Vincent motorcycles, as well as wheels which came from a Morris Minor. The body was made from 16-gauge aluminium. With the standard Rapide engine, \\"Polyphemus\\" could reach . Before it was sold, in the hands of Ted Davis, it achieved with a Black Lightning engine. The \\"Vincent 3-wheeler\\" was eventually sold to a member of the public for ¬£500 ‚Äì a high price for any vehicle at the time, especially for a vehicle with no reverse gear, self-starter or hood. The BMC Mini launched four years later at a price of ¬£497. Unfortunately Vincent motorcycles were hand-built and expensive ‚Äì only a total of 11,000 machines were sold post‚ÄìWorld War Two. A sales slump in 1954 forced the company to import and sell NSU mopeds. One hundred sixty two-stroke Foxes NSU-Vincent 123 cc were built. There were also 40 98cc OHV four-stroke NSU-Vincents, and Vincent also sold the \\"NSU Quickly\\" moped; too well it appears (selling about 20,000 in one year ‚Äì a footnote to how the market had changed again), as NSU took control of its own sales after a year. Vincent Picador In an attempt to diversify the company, Phil Vincent undertook development of a version of the motorcycle V-twin for aircraft applications. Development of this engine, named Picador, began in 1951 and continued until 1954, diverting funds from the motorcycle product line. The Picador was intended to power ultra-light aircraft. In particular the engine was to be used in the ML Aviation U120D Queen Bee pilotless target drone. To qualify for the government contract the motor had to be capable of passing prolonged full power operation tests. Initially built to Black Lightning specifications, the engine followed typical Vincent practice, with two air-cooled cylinders in a 50¬∞ V-formation and with the cylinders offset to improve cooling of the rear cylinder's exhaust valve. The engine displacement was , and it weighted , with a power output of @ 5000 rpm. The valves were operated by rockers and short pushrods driven by two camshafts mounted high in the engine's timing case, an arrangement euphemistically called \\"semi-overhead camshafts\\". The Picador motor was upgraded with a larger mainshaft, different big-ends, Scintilla magneto, and a double speed oil pump. To prevent fuel starvation during the U120D's rocket-assisted launch when accelerations of 10Gs would be generated, mechanical fuel injection driven from the propeller shaft replaced the usual carburettors. Unusually for an aircraft engine, the engine was mounted with the crankshaft transverse, although in the Queen Bee drone the engine was rotated 180¬∞ from its motorcycle applications, with the exhaust ports at the rear. An oilbath chain primary drive and a bevel gear drove the propeller with a 2:1 reduction from the engine speed. Due to ML Aviation's inability to deliver a working radio control system, Vincent did not win the contract. Russel Wright's record breaking bike was fitted with a Picador crank and oil pump, by Vincent, while in England for Earls Court, shortly after the 1955 record attempt. \\"The Last\\" Vincent motorcycle At the annual dinner of the Vincent H.R.D. Owners Club in the summer of 1955, Phil Vincent announced that the company could no longer continue in the face of heavy losses and that production of motorcycles would cease almost immediately. In 1955, one week before Christmas, the last Vincent came off the production line. Post-motorcycle manufacturing Vincent Amanda watercraft at the London Motorcycle Museum The factory then turned to general engineering, the manufacture of industrial engines, and there was the Amanda water scooter. A Vincent engineer lost his life testing it, drowning at sea. The company went into receivership in 1959. The name and motorcycle component manufacturing rights were taken over by a local business, Harper Engines Ltd., of Stevenage, Herts., and has since been bought and sold by other engineering firms. In the early 1970s the Vincent Owners Club created via public subscription the VOC Spares Company Ltd to ensure continued availability of spares. The company is independent of the club who retain a majority share holding.

The Norvin is now available from John Mossey under a new brand, JMC Classics, together with the Egli-framed Vincent. =Fritz Egli= Egli Vincent Fritz Egli, a specialist frame manufacturer based in Switzerland, produced an Egli-Vincent, and around 100 were produced between 1967 and 1972. Egli-Vincents were subsequently built under licence in France by Patrick Godet. JMC Classics also produce new Egli framed Vincents in UK. =Vincent RTV Motorcycles= Vincent RTV1200 In 1996, a new motorcycle company was formed by three individuals, Rodney Brown (a metallurgical engineer), Terry Prince (a Vincent enthusiast and specialist) and Ron Slender. Brown provided the financial start and along with Prince were the founding directors, with Slender specialising with business development post- production. The company was named RTV Motorcycles. Its ambition was to produce a modern-day classic Vincent motorcycle that could be marketed, in reasonable volumes, worldwide. It used a redesigned and modernised version of the Vincent engine, engineered by Prince, with an increased capacity and in an Egli-style frame. The motorcycles were to be built individually by hand. The range was to include both a touring and sports model in capacities of 1,000 cc (RTV1000) and 1,200 cc (RTV1200). Complete new engines would also be made available for separate purchase. Production was initially to begin for the larger capacity machine designated the RTV1200. These were to be fitted, as standard, with state of the art Bosch electric start, Brembo brakes, adjustable Paioli upside down forks, Ohlins rear monoshock and V-2 multiplate clutch. The first factory prototype RTV was built in 1998; other RTV prototypes were in various stages before the company went into voluntary liquidation towards the end of that year. =Vincent Motors= Vincent Motors USA founder and president, Bernard Li, acquired the Vincent trademark in 1994 and formally launched Vincent Motors USA in 1998, spending about $2 million building prototypes that resemble the original Vincent but utilised modern components like the Honda RC51 V-twin engine. Vincent Motors was based in San Diego.Beau 'Beato' Beaton on the Irving Vincent at Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2012 A resurrection of the Vincent name is now unlikely as the RC51 engine is out of production, and Li was killed in a single-bike crash in Arizona in 2008. =Irving Vincent= The Irving Vincent is produced in small numbers by HRD Engineering (Horner Race Development ‚Äì Ken and Barry Horner) in Hallam, Victoria, Australia. It is a re-engineered version based on the original Phil Irving drawings, with engine capacities of 1000 cc, 1300 cc or 1600 cc. Apart from the basic elements of the design, the Irving-Vincent was fully updated, with modern metallurgy, casting and milling allowing far stronger engine construction. The first Irving-Vincent was 1299cc in capacity, had a 14:1 compression ration, ran on ethanol and developed around 135 hp. Subsequent models increased the engine capacity to 1,571cc, developing 165 hp, followed by a four-valve, fuel injected engine of 1,600cc developing 180 hp and a top speed of nearly 170 mph. The marque gained worldwide recognition by winning the Daytona (Florida, US) 'Battle of the Twins' in its first attempt in 2008, ridden by Craig McMartin. Plans were made to return to Daytona for the 'Battle of the Twins' with the 1,600cc engined model, but this didn't happen.

Set primarily in rural Mississippi, the film explores interracial romance between African Americans and Indian Americans in the United States. It was released in France on 18 September 1991, in the United Kingdom on 17 January 1992 and in the U.S. on 5 February 1992. The film grossed $7,308,786 USD at the box office. Plot In 1972, dictator Idi Amin enacts the policy of the forceful removal of Asians from Uganda. Jay (Roshan Seth) his wife, Kinnu (Sharmila Tagore), and their daughter, Mina (Sarita Choudhury), a family of third-generation Ugandan Indians residing in Kampala reluctantly and tearfully leave their home behind and relocate. After spending a few years in England, Jay, Kinnu, and Mina settle in Greenwood, Mississippi to live with family members who own a chain of motels there. Despite the passage of time, Jay is unable to come to terms with his sudden departure from his home country, and cannot fully embrace the American lifestyle. He dreams of one day returning with his family to Kampala. The effects of Amin's dictatorship have caused Jay to become distrustful towards black people. Mina, on the other hand, has fully assimilated to the American culture and has a diverse group of friends. She feels stifled by her parents' wish to only associate with members of their own community. She falls in love with Demetrius (Denzel Washington), a local African American self-employed carpet cleaner. Mina is aware that her parents will not approve and keeps the relationship somewhat secret. The pair decide to spend a romantic clandestine weekend together in Biloxi, where they are spotted by members of the Indian community, and the gossip begins to spread. Jay is outraged and ashamed, and forbids Mina from ever seeing Demetrius again. Mina also faces both subtle and outright dislike from the black community. Demetrius confronts Jay, who reveals his experiences and racist treatment in Uganda, causing Demetrius to call out Jay on his hypocrisy. Ultimately, the two families cannot fully come to terms with the interracial pair, who flee the state together in Demetrius's van. Jay's wish finally becomes reality when he travels to Kampala to attend a court proceeding on the disposition of his previously confiscated house. While in the country however, he sees how much it has changed and realises that he no longer identifies with the land of his birth. Jay returns to America and relinquishes his long-nurtured dream of returning to Uganda, the place he considered home.

The present time in the novel takes place several years later, when Shigematsu and his wife Shigeko become the guardians of their niece, Yasuko, and thus obligated to find a suitable husband for her. At the start of the novel, three earlier attempts to arrange a match have already failed due to health concerns over her having been exposed to the \\"Black Rain\\" ‚Äì firestorm-generated, soot-filled rain that may also have contained high concentrations of fission products and carbon-14, depending on the precipitation's location and time of onset. The radiation sickness is one of the main causes of concern throughout the story. Shigematsu's journal entries attempt to disprove her sickness, but in the end it turns out that Yasuko was indeed affected by the \\"Black Rain\\". Adaptations Director Shohei Imamura directed a film adaptation of the Japanese novel in 1989.

Popular music Yor√πb√° music is regarded as one of the more important components of the modern Nigerian popular music scene. Although traditional Yoruba music was not influenced by foreign music the same cannot be said of modern-day Yoruba music which has evolved and adapted itself through contact with foreign instruments, talents and creativity. Interpretation involves rendering African, here Yoruba, musical expression using a mixture of instruments from different horizons. Yoruba music traditionally centred on folklore and spiritual/deity worship, utilising basic and natural instruments such as clapping of the hands. Playing music for a living was not something the Yorubas did and singers were referred to in a derogatory term of Alagbe, it is this derogation of musicians that made it not appeal to modern Yoruba at the time. Although, it is true that music genres like the highlife played by musicians like Rex Lawson, Ebenezer Obey Segun Bucknor, Bobby Benson, etc., Fela Kuti's AfrobeatRandle. F.Grass, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Art of an Afrobeat Rebel, The MIT Press, TDR (journal), vol. 30, no.1, 1986 pp. 131-148 and King Sunny Ad√©'s j√πj√∫Christopher Alan Waterman, J√πj√∫: A Social History and Ethnography of an African Popular Music, (ed Paperback), Chicargo, University of Chicargo Press, 1990 are all Yoruba adaptations of foreign music. These musical genres have their roots in large metropolitan cities like Lagos, Ibadan, and Port Harcourt where people and culture mix influenced by their rich culture. Some pioneering J√πj√∫ musicians include Tunde King, Tunde Nightingale, Why Worry in Ondo and Ayinde Bakare,Dr. Orlando Owoh, Dele Ojo, Ik Dairo Moses Olaiya (Baba Sala). sakara played by the pioneers such as Ojo Olawale in Ibadan, Abibu Oluwa, Yusuf Olatunji, Sanusi Aka, Saka Layigbade. Apala, is another genre of Yoruba modern music which was played by spirited pacesetters such as Haruna Ishola, Sefiu Ayan, Ligali Mukaiba, Kasumu Adio, Yekini (Y.K.) Ajadi, etc. Fuji, which emerged in the late 60s/early 70s, as an offshoot of were/ajisari music genres, which were made popular by certain Ibadan singers/musicians such as the late Sikiru Ayinde Barrister, Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara and Ganiyu Kuti or \\"Gani Irefin. Another popular genre is waka music played and popularized by Alhaja Batuli Alake and, more recently, Salawa Abeni, Kuburat Alaragbo, Asanat Omo-Aje, Mujidat Ogunfalu, Misitura Akawe, Fatimo Akingbade, Karimot Aduke, and Risikat Abeawo. In both Ibadan (Nigeria's largest city), and Lagos (Nigeria's most populous city), these multicultural traditions were brought together and became the root of Nigerian popular music.

Already advertising their existing 110 mph Rapide machine as \\"The world's fastest production motorcycle\\", in February 1948 the distinctive Vincent Black Shadow was announced with a top speed of 125 mph. Built in three different Series over the course of its life, the line continued until 1955, after which the company stopped all motorcycle production. Design Series C engine =Engine and transmission= The Black Shadow uses a version of the air-cooled four-stroke 50¬∞ V-twin engine that powers the Vincent Rapide. Bore and stroke of the undersquare twin are 84 mm and 90 mm respectively, giving a displacement of . Each cylinder's two overhead valves are operated through rocker arms and short pushrods by two gear-driven cams mounted high in the engine's timing case. The valves have both upper and lower guides, and the rocker arms are forked at the valve end to operate the valve by pushing on a metal shoulder part way along the length of the stem. On Series B and Series C Shadows the spark-plug for the front cylinder is on the right hand side while the one for the rear cylinder is on the left. On Series D bikes both plugs are on the right. The engine has dry sump lubrication. The electrics on Series D bikes are by Lucas This included a change to coil ignition and a DKX2A distributor. Engines for Black Shadows were largely built out of selected Rapide production parts. The camshafts, for example, were standard Rapide units; MkIs in early examples and MkIIIs from 1952 onward. Parts were hand-selected for tighter tolerances, and airflow was improved by blending and polishing of the engine's ports. Early Black Shadows have a third inner valve spring not shared with the Rapide, but this feature was dropped from later bikes. Due to the low-octane 'Pool' petrol that was all that was available in the early post-war years, bikes of the period could have only low compression ratios. Although the prototype Black Shadow was built with a compression ratio lower than the Rapide's nominal 6.8:1, production Shadows have a ratio of 7.3:1 due to having different pistons from the Rapide, although still supplied by Specialloid. The Black Shadows have different carburettors from the Rapides, with Series B and C bikes having 1‚Öõ\\" Amal 289 carburettors and Series D bikes having 1‚Öõ\\" Amal Type 389/10 units. While other contemporary motorcycles tended to be polished and chromed, founder Philip Conrad Vincent (PCV) decreed that the Black Shadow engine itself be black. The engine's signature colour was achieved by applying a \\"pyluminising\\" coating of chromate anti-corrosion primer over which a layer of Pinchin & Johnson black enamel was added. The part was then baked in an oven for 2 hours at . Although some have claimed that the black finish increased the rate of heat rejection from the engine, its main real benefit seems to have been its visual impact. Unit construction combines the bike's engine and 4-speed Vincent transmission in a single housing. The ratio of the bottom gear was raised from 9:1 to 7.2:1 =Frame and bodywork= As in the Series B Rapide, the engine is mounted as a stressed member, eliminating the need for a downtube cradle. Series B and C Black Shadows use an upper frame member (UFM) consisting of a fabricated steel box that doubles as an oil tank. On the Series D bikes the revised UFM is a simple tubular member with brazed lugs at each end bolted to a slightly modified version of the Series C malleable iron steering head casting. This revised UFM no longer carries oil and so a separate oil tank is fitted. Due to extensive use of aluminium alloy, weight for the complete bike is kept to a relatively light . The standard handlebar on all models of HRDs and Vincents is the black enamelled \`HRD straights'. Series B and C bars are 7/8 inches in diameter and 25 inches long with the ends bent back at 20¬∞. Series D bars are 1¬Ω inches longer. The Black Shadow could be had in Touring specification, and a sidecar could be fitted on either side of the bike. The Series B and C machines do not carry any indication of the model name in their transfers, lining or badges. Beginning in 1955 on the Series D Black Shadow the figure of Mercury is joined by transfer text reading \\"Black Shadow\\". =Suspension= The rear suspension of the Black Shadow is a cantilever system, with a rear frame member (RFM) of two parallel upright triangular members pivoting from heavy plates on the back of the transmission case at the bottom and attached at the top to two spring boxes angled out from the seat post and damped by a hydraulic damper. In the Series D the RFM was redesigned with relocated spring box lugs and a new, single Armstrong spring/damper unit. These changes resulted in a 30% increase in travel to a full . In front the Series B Black Shadows have the same Brampton girder fork used on the Series B Rapide. A 180 lb front spring is fitted on the Series B Shadows, in contrast to the 160 lb units on the Rapide. In Series C and later Black Shadows the Brampton unit is replaced by Vincent's own Girdraulic blade-type girder variation that used a hydraulic damper in place of a coil spring. Another Series C change was the appearance of curved lugs for the seat stays. =Brakes, wheels, tyres= The brakes on Series B and Series C Black Shadows are dual single leading shoe (SLS) drums front and rear. Unlike the Rapide, the drums are not interchangeable front-to-rear on the Black Shadows. The Shadow drums are ribbed cast iron. The front drum has a small flange and is attached with five bolts, while the rear has a larger flange and is attached with ten bolts. The brakes use Ferodo's MR41 linings, which was new on the Shadows. =Instrumentation= The primary instrumentation on Series B and Series C Black Shadows is a Smiths chronometric speedometer that from 1949 on was a large unit mounted almost vertically. Speedometers on domestic models are calibrated up to 150 mph, while export models are fitted with a 240 km/h equivalent. Series D Black Shadows do not use the 5 inch speedometer but rather a 150 mph version of the ordinary S576/L instrument. Model history Series C Black Shadow While the Series B Rapide was not designed to be a racer, PCV felt that steady improvement was necessary and drew up a specification for a version with greater performance. The factory had been receiving inquiries regarding tuning options that would increase performance of the existing model, and PCV believed that a new model would offer two things; an upgrade path for owners looking for more speed and increased profits for the factory. Further encouragement was provided by the racing success of factory racer and performance testbed Gunga Din. When PCV proposed the new model to Vincent managing director Frank Walker, Walker refused to authorise development. Engineer Phil Irving and racer and Development shop head George Brown quietly built two bikes to the new specifications. The prototype Black Shadow had engine number F10AB/1B/558 in frame R2549, and was completed on 16 February 1948. The bike was road tested by Charles Markham in Motor Cycling May 1948, during which test the bike was reported to have reached . The Black Shadow was officially introduced at the 1948 Motorcycle Show at Earls Court in London. When it was tested by the respected journal Motor Cycle in 1949, they concluded ‚Äò‚ÄòIt is a connoisseur‚Äôs machine: one with speed and acceleration far greater than any other standard motor cycle; and with unique and ingenious features which make it one of the outstanding designs of all time. So far as the standards of engine performance, handling and braking are concerned ‚Äì the chief features which can make or mar an otherwise excellent mount ‚Äì the mighty Black Shadow must be awarded 99 out of 100 marks: 99 because nothing, it is said, is perfect.Currie, Bob (1980). Hamlyn Publshing Group Ltd. Great British Motorcycles of the Fifties, p.16 The Black Shadows were built with the same labour-intensive hand-fitting of bearings and major engine parts that Vincent had used prior to the war. Official records say that 1774 Vincent Black Shadows were made. Vincent also built 15 \\"White Shadow\\" models to the same mechanical specifications as the Black Shadows but with an engine that was polished rather than enamelled. White Shadow engines had a prefix of \\"1A/\\".Classic Bike, September 2002, pp.45‚Äì55 Accessed 20 December 2017. Spotters Guide:Vincent Twins \\"There is some disagreement among Vincent enthusiasts as to whether or not the White Shadow should be regarded as a model in its own right. We included it in this guide because it was allocated its own engine designation. The machine is identical to the Black Shadow in spec but with the black engine enamel replaced by the polished alloy finish used on the Rapide\\". In 2007 the Vincent H¬∑R¬∑D Owners Club commissioned the VOC Spares Company Limited to build a replica Black Shadow from new parts. The goal of the project was to prove that all parts were in stock and available from the VOC Spares Company Limited. Having received glowing reviews from the motorcycle press in the UK, the machine was auctioned by Bonhams and eventually went on display at a museum in New Zealand. Journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote \\"If you rode the Black Shadow at top speed for any length of time, you would almost certainly die. That is why there are not many life members of the Vincent Black Shadow Society.\\" The bike is mentioned several times in Thompson's 1971 novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Motorsports =Bonneville 1948= Black Shadow serial number F10AB/1B/900 was a specially prepared model sold to American John Edgar for the purpose of challenging the American land speed record for motorcycles. The goal was to take the AMA National Class A flying-mile record then held by Joe Petrali and his modified Harley-Davidson and which stood at . The bike had to be in Los Angeles California before September 1948. 1B/900 was a factory-built racer, but as there was no plan to market such a version as a separate model when it was built, the bike began life as a Black Shadow even though it was later referred to as a Black Lightning by the factory. Vincent mechanic Cliff Brown writes that he built a modified engine for the bike, with extensive porting and polishing and a compression ratio of 12.75:1. Brown also reports that he designed and ground three sets of prototype MkII cams for the bike. This origin of the engine is disputed by Denis Minett, head of the Special Engine Department at Vincent at the time. 1B/900 was test-ridden by Cliff's brother George, who was said to have taken the bike to over at the Gransden Aerodrome. After this the bike was shipped to Vincent dealer V.L. Margin in California. Edgar had arranged for American Rollie Free to pilot the bike on the record attempts. Free unofficially broke the record during a test run at Rosamond Dry Lake in California with a recorded speed of 138 mph. On 13 September 1948 Free and 1B/900 appeared at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA. On his first run Free set a new record for naturally aspirated motorcycles of . Free then stripped off his racing leathers and on his final run, laying prone on the fender of the bike, set a record speed of . A picture taken during this run earned this motorcycle the name \\"the bathing suit bike\\". On the basis of this run Vincent's subsequent advertising used the slogan \\"The world's fastest standard motorcycle: This is a FACT ‚Äì NOT a Slogan!\\" =Montlh√©ry 1952= With support from the Wakefield Oil Company, owners of the Castrol brand, Vincent took seven bikes to Montlh√©ry France in 1952 to challenge a variety of endurance records, the 100 mph for 24 hours record in particular. The bikes were a mix of Black Shadows and Black Lightnings, along with Gunga Din which served as a test hack and did not participate in the record runs. The Black Shadows that did run were modified to very nearly the same specifications as the Black Lightnings. The record attempts started on 13 May 1952 and continued for three days. The motorcycles faced unusually high temperatures at the track that year. Big-end failures put an early end to the attempt but several records were achieved including the 6 Hours and 1000 Kilometres by a Black Shadow. One of the spare engines for the run at Montlh√©ry wound up in Vietnam. It was sold to an owner in the United States, who installed it in a Rapide frame. The bike changed hands several times before being bought by Herb Harris and restored to Black Shadow specifications.

The alternate spelling \\"Mahantango\\" is often found in early publications, e.g., (Floyd 1911).Mahantongo Street The Mahantongo culture The Mahantongo culture area is much more extensive than the creek valley itself. It straddles Schuylkill, Northumberland, and Dauphin Counties, including several adjoining valleys, among them the Lykens or Hegins Valley to the South, and the Schwaben Creek and Mahanoy Creek valleys to the North. The part of this area that is now included in Schuylkill County was in the first decade of the nineteenth century a huge township called Mahantongo Township. Until 1811, when Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania was set off, Mahantongo Township was part of Berks County, and was later divided into Upper and Lower Mahantongo Townships, which in turn were divided into smaller subdivisions. After 1800 the Mahantongo area in Schuylkill and Northumberland Counties became an important settlement point including new industrial towns that were growing up in the anthracite Coal Region to the north - including Shamokin and Mt. Carmel. Mahantongo Township, north of Blue Mountain, is now Schuylkill County. The Mahantongo Valley Nestled in the pocket of the Blue Mountains of the Appalachian chain, the Mahantongo Valley extends east from the Susquehanna River for 17 miles. Bordered to the north by Line Mountain, once the boundary between the Commonwealth and the Indian Lands, it extends four miles to the south where the Mahantongo Mountain closes the valley. rises in the mountains of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania The Mahantongo Valley aesthetic has been explored in various recent studies, particularly those of Frederick S. Weiser and Mary Hammond-Sullivan who focused attention on decorated furniture made in the region. They described the highly distinctive furniture that had been created between 1798 and 1828 along the Schwaben Creek Area of the Mahantongo Valley. The decorative furniture of the region has also been featured in national publications such as Early American Homes. Throughout the 20th century the fertile Mahantongo Valley has provided the bordering coal regions with produce. At the northeastern end of the valley where the Line and Mahantongo Mountains meet, farmers traveled to the densely populated coal towns of Shamokin, Mount Carmel, Ashland, Girardville, Shenandoah, Frackville, Mahanoy City, Minersville and others to peddle fresh produce. These traditions carry on today. Mahantongo farmers continue to retail produce locally in addition to regional wholesale distribution. The Mahantango Valley today comprises seven townships. From west to east they include: Lower Mahanoy, Jackson, Jordan, Washington, Lower Mahantango, Upper Mahantango, and Eldred. Towns and villages from west to east include: Dalmatia, Herndon, Mandata, Pillow, Red Cross, Rebuck, Hebe, Greenbrier, Klingerstown, Leck Kill, Rough and Ready, Hepler, Pitman, and Haas. Significant State Roads through the Mahantongo Valley include SR 147 which stretches north / south from Sunbury to Harrisburg along the Susquehanna River. Also near the western end of the Mahantongo Valley, SR 225 progresses north / south from Shamokin to Mandata. SR 125 bisects the Upper and Lower Mahantango townships running north / south from Shamokin to Hegins. This latter route is well known for its scenic and snaking roadway over the many small hills and dells and is frequented by motorcyclists throughout the summer months. Mahantongo Street thumb Mahantongo Street is a street with historically affluent residents in Pottsville. It is the location of the old Necho Allen hotel, the Yuengling brewery (the oldest American brewery still in operation), and the former home of novelist John O'Hara. Also located on the street are many homes of former coal barons and the famous Yuengling Mansion, now the Schuylkill County Art and Ethnic Center.

The cable is operated by Global Cloud Xchange, a subsidiary of RCOM. The system runs from the eastern coast of North America to Japan. Its Europe-Asia segment was the fourth longest cable in the world in 2008. The Europe-Asia segment was laid by Cable & Wireless Marine in the mid-1990s, and was the subject of an article in Wired magazine in December 1996 by Neal Stephenson. Description The FLAG cable system was first placed into commercial service in late 1997. FLAG offered a speed of 10 Gbit/s, and uses synchronous digital hierarchy technology. It carries over 120,000 voice channels via of mostly undersea cable. FLAG uses erbium-doped fibre amplifiers, and was jointly supplied by AT&T; Submarine Systems and KDD- Submarine Cable Systems. Its design, development, installation, and service conformed to ISO 9000 quality standards. FLAG provided a link between the European end of high-density transatlantic crossings and the Asian end of the transpacific crossings. FLAG includes undersea cable segments, and two terrestrial crossings. The segments can be either direct point-to-point links, or multi-point links, which are attained through branching units. At each cable landing point, a FLAG cable station is located. The total route length exceeds , and comprises of terrestrial crossings. Approximately of the submerged cable is buried below the sea bed. Cable burial was performed by either a submersible plough as the cable was laid, or jetting the laid cable into the sea bed via remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Over several years, the route evolved as new branches and feeder systems were considered and realized. FLAG includes two terrestrial crossings, one in Egypt, and the other in Thailand. Each of these land crossings is totally duplicated on fully different routes. As a result, any fault within one route will cause automatic protection switching to the other route within a time period of less than 50 ms. Like other global undersea networks, FLAG uses erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs). EDFAs boost the optical signals instead of the optical/electrical conversion, which is generally used in regenerative technology. These optical amplifiers use short, gain-specific lengths of fibre which are doped with erbium ions, and spliced in-line with the transmission fibre. The signal power is amplified by pumping the erbium-doped fibre (EDF) with 1,480 nm laser light which is attached through an optical coupler. The majority of the repeater components are passive. These include EDF, fused- fibre optical couplers and optical isolators. Active components include laser pump assemblies, and associated controls. The total number of components within the repeater is lesser than that of regenerative systems. The FLAG terrestrial crossings do not contain repeaters for reliability reasons. The terminal stations in land crossings use optical amplifiers, high performance transmitter / receivers, and forward error correction to cross the large distances without repeaters. Amplification at the terminal output provides output signal power as high as +17 dBm, and optical amplification at the receiver improves the receiver sensitivity as much as 8 dB. The route between Alexandria and Cairo is long, and hence requires remote pumping in order to meet performance requirements. Remotely pumped amplifiers can be regarded as repeaters without active modules. This technology comprises short lengths of EDF spliced into the land cable. The erbium-doped sections are situated within the cable span, and are pumped by 1,480 nm pump lasers which are based at the station. An upgrade to the network was announced in 2006, when the acronym was expanded to \\"Fibre Loop Across Globe\\" (FLAG).

The respective contributions of the two cable systems to this blackout is unclear. Network outage graphs suggest that the two breaks occurred at 04:30 and 08:00 UTC. The cause of the damage was not declared by either cable operator, but news sources speculated the damage was caused by a ship's anchor near Alexandria. According to the Agence France-Presse, the Kuwaiti government attributed the breaks to \\"weather conditions and maritime traffic\\". The New York Times reported that the damage occurred to the two systems separately near Alexandria and near Marseilles.

He started by managing rappers for Rush Productions, then led Def Jam.Roberts, Johnnie L., \\"Rap's Unlikely King\\", The Daily Beast, Newsweek, January 31, 2000] After Def Jam, Cohen took on a leadership role at Warner Music Group. In September 2012, Cohen resigned from Warner and started his own independent label, 300 Entertainment. On September 28, 2016, Cohen was named YouTube's Global Head of Music.

Afterwards, he worked briefly in the Beverly Hills office of Bank Leumi.Lyor Cohen Beastiemania.com Music career =Rush Productions / Rush Artist Management= Late in 1984, after promoting a pair of rock and rap shows at The Mix Club in Hollywood (one featured Run-DMC, the other featured Whodini), Cohen moved to New York to take a job at Simmons' Rush Productions (later called Rush Artist Management). Beginning as Run-DMC's road manager, Cohen quickly began taking on additional responsibilities, working on behalf of an artist roster that included Kurtis Blow, Whodini, Run- DMC, LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, and Public Enemy. By 1987, Cohen himself was signing artists to Rush. These acts included Slick Rick, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Eric B. & Rakim, EPMD, Stetsasonic, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest.Lyor Cohen About.com Cohen credits Jam Master Jay with teaching him the basics of the music business. \\"[Jay] showed me how to settle shows and fulfill my responsibilities to the group,\\" Cohen told Vibe magazine.Ogunnaike, Lola, \\"Soldier of Fortune\\", Vibe magazine, January 2003. \\"It's those lessons that I rely on daily to do what I do now.\\" Before long, according to Rolling Stone, Cohen \\"became known for his no-nonsense approach to business, his negotiating skill, his ability to forward the plot\\".Cohen, Rich, Rolling Ston \\"The Story of Lyor Cohen: Little Lansky and the Big Check\\", Rolling Stone, June 21, 2001, It was Cohen who brokered Run-DMC's endorsement deal with Adidas, \\"one of the first big commercial deals for a rap group\\". This deal was followed by others that paired up Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince with Le Coq Sportif, LL Cool J with Troop sportswear, and Run-DMC with New Coke. By 1989, Rush‚Äîunder Cohen's leadership‚Äîwas recognized as \\"the premier management operation\\" in the Rap field.Nathan, David, \\"Lyor Cohen: Breaking Corporate Barriers at Rush\\", Black Radio Exclusive, January 27, 1989.

The goal was to capitalize on the ability of established recording artists to sniff out new talent by signing boutique label deals with them. It paid off most notably with Jam Master Jay's JMJ Records, which brought Onyx to Def Jam in 1992 and Jayo Felony in 1994. By then Cohen was starting to groom a new generation of executives, notably Chris Lighty, Julie Greenwald, Kevin Liles,\\"My mentor, Lyor Cohen ...,‚Äù p. 6, Make it Happen: the Hip-Hop Generation Guide to Success, by Kevin Liles with Samantha Marshall, Atria Books, 2005 Todd Moscowitz, and Mike Kyser. In 1994 Cohen teamed up with Simmons to negotiate Def Jam's departure from Sony (which had been distributing Def Jam since 1985) for a new home at PolyGram. By then, having become Simmons's partner in the label several years earlier, Cohen was running Def Jam day-to-day. (Rick Rubin, Def Jam's founder, had left Def Jam in 1988.\\"Rubin Quits\\", New Musical Express, August 27, 1988.) Def Jam under PolyGram and Universal Under PolyGram and Cohen's leadership, Def Jam prospered. Cohen worked with a brand-new roster of successful rappers, like Redman, Method Man, Jay-Z, DMX, Ja Rule, Ludacris, and Kanye West. Concurrently, Cohen oversaw custom label deals with Roc-a-Fella, Murder Inc., Ruff Ryders, and Disturbing Tha Peace. In 1998, PolyGram was purchased by Seagram, and merged into Universal. The Island Def Jam In June 1998, after the PolyGram / Universal merger, Island, Mercury, and Def Jam were merged into a new unit called The Island Def Jam, Cohen was named co- president. In the process, he became (as he himself noted) \\"the first Hip-Hop president in charge of a major label\\".Zimmerman, Kevin, \\"Cohen & Caparro: From Rap to Rock with the Def Jam Duo\\", Music Business International, June 2000. This promotion required Cohen to expand his portfolio to include artists who didn't rap, among them Bon Jovi, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Elvis Costello, Ashanti, Nickelback, Slipknot, Sum 41, The Killers, and Slayer. In 2001, Cohen was involved in Island Def Jam's purchase of Roadrunner, a heavy-metal label, as well as the deal to distribute Rick Rubin's American. In 2002, American released Johnny Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around. The last album released by Cash before his death, it included Cash's hit version of Trent Reznor's \\"Hurt\\". =Warner= In January 2004 Cohen left Island Def Jam for a position with the Edgar Bronfman Jr. investor group-financed Warner, which was subsequently spun off from Time Warner. Ultimately, Cohen was named WMG's chairman and chief executive.Smith, Ethan, \\"Warner Music Lures Rap Chief From Universal to Fill New Post\\", The Wall Street Journal, January 26, 2004. By 2006, the positive effects of Cohen's leadership were encapsulated in a story for the Los Angeles Times, which noted: \\"Under Cohen, Warner Music has thrived, due in part to the executive's innovative initiatives, such as an incubator program that builds relationships with independent label executives the company aspires to hire.\\"Duhigg, Charles, \\"Getting Warner Music More Upbeat: U.S. CEO Lyor Cohen is Heading a Turnaround that Includes a Recent Boost in Market Share\\", Los Angeles Times, August 28, 2006. Warner's success with Mike Jones and the punk band Paramore both grew out of the incubator program. At Warner, Cohen oversaw the merger of the Atlantic and Elektra labels into Atlantic, and placed Julie Greenwald, his prot√©g√©e, into a top executive position there. In 2009, Cohen elevated Greenwald to chairman and chief operating officer of Atlantic, a promotion that established Greenwald as the highest-ranking woman executive at an American record company.\\"Women in Music 2011: No.1 Julie Greenwald\\", Billboard Greenwald's successes at Atlantic have included The Black Keys, Bruno Mars, Death Cab for Cutie, Jason Mraz, Kid Rock, Lupe Fiasco, Plies, T.I., and Wiz Khalifa. YouTube and Spotify In September 2006, Cohen oversaw an agreement with YouTube that allowed the site to show videos by Warner artists in exchange for a share of YouTube's advertising revenue. According to The New York Times, the deal marked \\"the first time a major record company [had] licensed content to YouTube\\". In 2011, Cohen oversaw an agreement on behalf of the Warner roster with Spotify, the digital music service. Eventually, Cohen oversaw all of Warner's digital initiatives. Departure from Warner In September 2012 Cohen resigned from Warner where he served as one of their dominant creative executives. =Future ventures and 300= There was much speculation about Cohen's next move.\\"Are Lyor Cohen and Irv Gotti Forming a New Company?\\", Keenan Higgins, Vibe December 20, 2012. Cohen's own assessment of his career was broadly predictive. \\"I've been an outsider in the traditional record industry for more than 25 years,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \\"I'm an entrepreneur, so I encourage risk-taking. And the only way to encourage risk-taking is to take risks yourself, which means sometimes you'll fail, or people will say you are too aggressive or controversial. But someone needs to jump into the pool first for a party to get really great. I've always been willing to be that guy.\\" In November 2013, Cohen revealed he was starting a new company named \\"300\\", after the 300 Spartan Warriors who fought the famous war against the Persians seen in the movie 300. He stated the company would be part record label, part marketing company, part distributor, with major backing from Google and Atlantic. =Joining YouTube= In September 2016, Google's YouTube announced Lyor would be joining the organization as Global Head of Music. He officially joined the company in December 2016. He wrote a public letter stating some of his goals and aspirations for his new role. He will strive to enable the music industry to adopt new business models that take advantage of technological advances.

Early life Rankin was born in Hartington, Nebraska, the son of Herman P. and Lois Gable Rankin. He attended public schools, and earned both his undergraduate and law degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law. In 1930 Rankin was admitted to the bar in Nebraska and began the practice of law in Lincoln, Nebraska. Known for his straightforward, quiet, and friendly demeanor, Rankin (known to his friends and colleagues as Lee), loved to tend roses, play the piccolo, and was an enthusiastic amateur photographer. In 1935, he became a partner and worked with the firm for over 20 years. Career Rankin served as Solicitor General from 1956 to 1961. In 1952, Rankin managed the Dwight Eisenhower for President campaign in Nebraska and in 1953, Eisenhower selected Rankin to serve as United States Assistant Attorney General. In 1953, he was appointed Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel. In this capacity, Rankin may best be remembered for arguing in favor of the African-American plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), advocating that the doctrine of \\"separate-but-equal\\" facilities for blacks and whites was unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown, Rankin argued in a presentation before the Court that the effort to desegregate schools should take place gradually in an effort to avoid any violence that might arise from the decision. Accordingly, he suggested the plan by which local school districts submitted desegregation plans to federal judges in their states. In addition, Rankin argued a great range of other important cases before the Supreme Court. He was instrumental in resolving conflicting claims among Western states to the Colorado River, and in establishing a balance of federal and state jurisdictions in offshore oil drilling. On August 14, 1956, Rankin was appointed U.S. Solicitor General. In response to lawsuits in many states arising out of legislative reapportionment fights, he developed the Justice Department's position that led to the principle of one man, one vote. After serving as solicitor general from August 1956 to January 1961, Rankin represented the American Civil Liberties Union in advancing the landmark case, Gideon v. Wainwright, solidifying the right of an indigent person accused of a crime to have legal counsel at public expense. Following President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the appointment of Chief Justice Warren to serve as the Chairman of a Presidential Commission to ascertain the truth about Dallas, Rankin was selected by Chief Justice Warren to serve as General Counsel in the inquiry that concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in killing President Kennedy. According to Edward Epstein's \\"Inquest\\" (publishing by Viking in 1966, and the outgrowth of his Cornell Master's thesis in which he interviewed the seven members of the Commission, and almost all of the legal staff), Rankin was primarily an administrator and lent a decent guiding hand in shaping the investigation. The 14 man legal staff was split into seven two-man teams, each of which handled a separate area of the investigation (e.g., the autopsy, the Ruby area, Oswald's biography, etc.) Each team was responsible for a separate area of the investigation, and, essentially, submitted a separate chapter of the Warren Report. The attorney who tied it all together‚Äîwho did much of the \\"heavy lifting\\" and who Epstein credited with redrafting and editing the commission's voluminous report into a work of polished prose‚Äîwas Norman Redlich. Subsequently, Rankin practiced law in New York City until the 1970s, working seven years as the New York City Corporation Counsel (1966-1972). Later life Upon retirement, Rankin and his wife of 63 years, Gertrude, moved to Weston, Connecticut, where they had a summer home. In 1993, they relocated to their home in Los Gatos, California. Mr. and Mrs. Rankin had two sons, James Jr. and Roger C., and one daughter, Sara Stadler; six grandchildren, Todd, Stephanie, Russell, Andrew, Amy, and Justin; and four great-grandchildren, Camden, Thomas, Hannah, and Faith. Rankin died on June 26, 1996 in Santa Cruz, California. He is interred at Santa Cruz Memorial Park in Santa Cruz.

Sewerby forms part of the civil parish of Bridlington. Sewerby is home to one of the East Riding's most popular tourist attractions, Sewerby Hall. The hall is a Grade I listed building and is home to the Museum of East Yorkshire, including a room dedicated to the aviator, Amy Johnson. The church dedicated to St John the Evangelist was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1976 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. History Sewerby is mentioned in the Domesday Book; \\"In Siwardbi, Carle and Torchil had two manors, of six carucates and a half. It is now waste.\\" This indicates the origin of the name: It was the (by) abode of Siward. (This is a Danish personal name, and one who bore it was the Governor of Northumbria). And, that Sewerby had two manors which were owned by Carle and Torchil, though no subsequent reference deals with more than one. And finally, that after William put down the English revolt in 1069, much of the land was now waste. Sewerby Rocks The two manors, formally owned by Carle & Torchil, were passed down in 1086 to Robert Count of Mortain and the Earl of Cornwall, the half-brother to William the Conqueror. Though, in the year 1088 Count Robert had his estate confiscated. There is no record of the fate of Robert's under-tenant, Richard de Surdeval, though it is possible his family survived as the de Sywardbys, using the name of the village. The estate of Mortain passed to the Paynel family and then on to the archbishops of Canterbury. The land was held for them by the Meynells. The Meynells then granted land to Osbert de Sywardby sometime in the 1170s. The de Sywardbys appear to have owned most of the land around Sewerby and Marton. Their position strengthened by marriages with the de Martons and the de Bucktons and during the 14th century 3 generations of the de Sywardby family were knighted. Sewerby Hall In 1234 Robert de Sywardby held 3 carucates of land with William de Sywardby holding 4 carucates by 1299. Robert of Sewerby was lord of the manor in 1316 and the family held it until the death of William de Sywardby in 1452. Williams's daughter held the land until her son sold the land to Ralph Raysing in 1545 and so the estate finally passed out of the hands of the descendants of Osbert de Sywardby after nearly 400 years. In the same year Raysing also bought other properties in Sewerby. Raysing held the land until 1567 when he sold it to John Carliell. The Ship Inn The Carliell family held the land until 1714 when it was sold to John Graeme. John Graeme was actually living in the manor house when he bought the land. It is said that John and his son Robert made their fortunes by acting as agents for a Lady Boococke, a considerable landowner in Bridlington. Sewerby House was almost re-built by John Graeme between the years 1714 & 1720\\\\.

Established in 1926 as Leeton's first high school and is now one of three public secondary schools serving the Leeton Shire, the school enrolled approximately 470 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 13 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and nine percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the New South Wales Department of Education; the principal is Meagan Crelley. History The \\"Old school building\\", pictured in 1927 The school was established on 18 September 1926 as Leeton District School by the Minister for Education, Thomas Mutch. Raised to the status of Intermediate High School from 1 January 1928, the school was upgraded to a fully comprehensive high school in January 1947. =Significant events= In May 2005, the school was devastated by fire that destroyed the science block. A new state-of-the-art block was opened ahead of schedule in February 2006. In 2007, parts of the school were again devastated by fires. Later in 2007, the school was again devastated by fires, this time destroying the English wing. Work on rebuilding that wing finished in November 2009. There is currently no evidence or official statements to prove if it was arson. On 5 April 2015, English and drama teacher Stephanie Scott was raped and murdered on the school grounds by janitor Vincent Stanford. Stanford was later convicted of murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. An amphitheatre was later built in the school as a memorial to her death.

Such a field may or may not be massless, and it may be taken to have minimal curvature coupling, or some other choice, such as conformal coupling. Mathematical definition In general relativity, the geometric setting for physical phenomena is a Lorentzian manifold, which is physically interpreted as a curved spacetime, and which is mathematically specified by defining a metric tensor g_{ab} (or by defining a frame field). The curvature tensor R^{a}_{bcd} of this manifold and associated quantities such as the Einstein tensor G_{ab}, are well-defined even in the absence of any physical theory, but in general relativity they acquire a physical interpretation as geometric manifestations of the gravitational field. In addition, we must specify a scalar field by giving a function \\\\psi. This function is required to satisfy two following conditions: # The function must satisfy the (curved spacetime) source-free wave equation g^{ab} \\\\psi_{;ab} = 0, # The Einstein tensor must match the stress-energy tensor for the scalar field, which in the simplest case, a minimally coupled massless scalar field, can be written G_{ab}= 8 \\\\pi \\\\left( \\\\psi_{;a} \\\\psi_{;b} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\psi_{;m} \\\\psi^{;m} g_{ab} \\\\right) . Both conditions follow from varying the Lagrangian density for the scalar field, which in the case of a minimally coupled massless scalar field is : L = -g^{mn} \\\\, \\\\psi_{;m} \\\\, \\\\psi_{;n} Here, :\\\\frac{\\\\delta L}{\\\\delta \\\\psi} = 0 gives the wave equation, while :\\\\frac{\\\\delta L}{\\\\delta g^{ab}} = 0 gives the Einstein equation (in the case where the field energy of the scalar field is the only source of the gravitational field). Physical interpretation Scalar fields are often interpreted as classical approximations, in the sense of effective field theory, to some quantum field. In general relativity, the speculative quintessence field can appear as a scalar field. For example, a flux of neutral pions can in principle be modeled as a minimally coupled massless scalar field. Einstein tensor The components of a tensor computed with respect to a frame field rather than the coordinate basis are often called physical components, because these are the components which can (in principle) be measured by an observer. In the special case of a minimally coupled massless scalar field, an adapted frame :\\\\vec{e}_0, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_1, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_2, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_3 (the first is a timelike unit vector field, the last three are spacelike unit vector fields) can always be found in which the Einstein tensor takes the simple form : G_{\\\\hat{a}\\\\hat{b}} = 8 \\\\pi \\\\sigma \\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix}-1&0&0&00&1&0&00&0&1&00&0&0&1\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] where \\\\sigma is the energy density of the scalar field. Eigenvalues The characteristic polynomial of the Einstein tensor in a minimally coupled massless scalar field solution must have the form : \\\\chi(\\\\lambda) = (\\\\lambda + 8 \\\\pi \\\\sigma)^3 \\\\, ( \\\\lambda - 8 \\\\pi \\\\sigma ) In other words, we have a simple eigenvalue and a triple eigenvalue, each being the negative of the other. Multiply out and using Gr√∂bner basis methods, we find that the following three invariants must vanish identically: : a_2 = 0, \\\\; \\\\; a_1^3 + 4 a_3 = 0, \\\\; \\\\; a_1^4 + 16 a_4 = 0 Using Newton's identities, we can rewrite these in terms of the traces of the powers. We find that : t_2 = t_1^2, \\\\; t_3 = t_1^3/4, \\\\; t_4 = t_1^4/4 We can rewrite this in terms of index gymnastics as the manifestly invariant criteria: : {G^a}_a = -R : {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_a = R^2 : {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_c \\\\, {G^c}_a = R^3/4 : {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_c \\\\, {G^c}_d \\\\, {G^d}_a = R^4/4 Examples Notable individual scalar field solutions include :* the Janis‚ÄìNewman‚ÄìWinicour scalar field solution, which is the unique static and spherically symmetric massless minimally coupled scalar field solution.

This can be interpreted physically as a kind of classical approximation to a nonzero vacuum energy. These are discussed here as distinct from the vacuum solutions in which the cosmological constant is vanishing. Terminological note: this article concerns a standard concept, but there is apparently no standard term to denote this concept, so we have attempted to supply one for the benefit of wikipedia. Mathematical definition The Einstein field equation is often written as : G^{ab} + \\\\Lambda \\\\, g^{ab} = 8 \\\\pi \\\\, T^{ab}, with a so-called cosmological constant term \\\\Lambda \\\\, g^{ab}. However, it is possible to move this term to the right hand side and absorb it into the stress‚Äìenergy tensor T^{ab}, so that the cosmological constant term becomes just another contribution to the stress‚Äìenergy tensor. When other contributions to that tensor vanish, the result : G^{ab} = -\\\\Lambda \\\\, g^{ab} is a lambdavacuum. An equivalent formulation in terms of the Ricci tensor is : R^{ab} = \\\\left( R/2 - \\\\Lambda \\\\right) \\\\, g^{ab}. Physical interpretation A nonzero cosmological constant term can be interpreted in terms of a nonzero vacuum energy. There are two cases: *\\\\Lambda > 0: positive vacuum energy density and negative vacuum pressure (isotropic suction), as in de Sitter space, *\\\\Lambda < 0: negative vacuum energy density and positive vacuum pressure, as in anti-de Sitter space. The idea of the vacuum having an energy density might seem outrageous, but this does make sense in quantum field theory. Indeed, nonzero vacuum energies can even be experimentally verified in the Casimir effect. Einstein tensor The components of a tensor computed with respect to a frame field rather than the coordinate basis are often called physical components, because these are the components which can (in principle) be measured by an observer. A frame consists of four unit vector fields : \\\\vec{e}_0, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_1, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_2, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_3 Here, the first is a timelike unit vector field and the others are spacelike unit vector fields, and \\\\vec{e}_0 is everywhere orthogonal to the world lines of a family of observers (not necessarily inertial observers). Remarkably, in the case of lambdavacuum, all observers measure the same energy density and the same (isotropic) pressure. That is, the Einstein tensor takes the form : G^{\\\\hat{a}\\\\hat{b}} = -\\\\Lambda \\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} -1&0&0&00&1&0&00&0&1&00&0&0&1\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] Saying that this tensor takes the same form for all observers is the same as saying that the isotropy group of a lambdavacuum is SO(1,3), the full Lorentz group. Eigenvalues The characteristic polynomial of the Einstein tensor of a lambdavacuum must have the form : \\\\chi(\\\\zeta) = \\\\left( \\\\zeta + \\\\Lambda \\\\right)^4 Using Newton's identities, this condition can be re-expressed in terms of the traces of the powers of the Einstein tensor as : t_2 = t_1^2/4, \\\\; t_3 = t_1^3/16, \\\\; t_4 = t_1^4/64 where : t_1 = {G^a}_a, \\\\; t_2 = {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_a, \\\\; t_3 = {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_c \\\\, {G^c}_a, \\\\; t_4 = {G^a}_b \\\\, {G^b}_c \\\\, {G^c}_d \\\\, {G^d}_a are the traces of the powers of the linear operator corresponding to the Einstein tensor, which has second rank. Relation with Einstein manifolds The definition of a lambdavacuum solution makes mathematical sense irrespective of any physical interpretation, and lambdavacuums are in fact a special case of a concept which is studied by pure mathematicians. Einstein manifolds are Riemannian manifolds in which the Ricci tensor is proportional (by some constant, not otherwise specified) to the metric tensor. Such manifolds may have the wrong metric signature to admit a spacetime interpretation in general relativity, and may have the wrong dimension as well. But the Lorentzian manifolds which are also Einstein manifolds are precisely the Lambdavacuum solutions. Examples Noteworthy individual examples of lambdavacuum solutions include: *de Sitter lambdavacuum, often referred to as the dS cosmological model, *anti-de Sitter lambdavacuum, often referred to as the AdS cosmological model, *Schwarzschild‚ÄìdS lambdavacuum, which models a spherically symmetric massive object immersed in a de Sitter universe (and likewise for AdS), *Kerr‚ÄìdS lambdvacuum, the rotating generalization of the latter, *Nariai lambdavacuum; this is the only solution in general relativity, other than the Bertotti‚ÄìRobinson electrovacuum, which has a Cartesian product structure.

Best known as one half of the New Zealand Militia in WCW with Jack Victory. Morgan also wrestled in the NAWA/SAPW with Jack Victory as \\"The Royal Family\\". He was the last flag bearer for the original New Zealand Sheepherders. He was formerly the CEO of the now defunct Wellington-based professional wrestling promotion Kiwi Pro Wrestling. Professional wrestling career Mike Morgan made his professional wrestling debut in 1983 under the Ring name Rip Morgan working in his native New Zealand. On 8 September 1983 he won the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship but records are not clear on who he defeated to win the championship, nor who he later on lost the championship to. In 1984 he travelled to the United States of America where he was paired up with The Sheepherders (Luke Williams and Butch Miller), working as their \\"Flag Bearer\\", someone who would wave the New Zealand flag during their introductions and help them cheat during their matches. Morgan worked with the two to continue his wrestling training as Williams and Miller taught him aspects of professional wrestling outside of the actual wrestling moves. =The Sheepherders (1985‚Äì1986)= After his brief WWF run Morgan teamed up with Jonathan Boyd to form a new version of the Sheepherders, using the name \\"The Kiwi Sheepherders\\". Boyd and Morgan quickly made their name known in the Continental Wrestling Association, based out of Memphis, Tennessee by defeating CWA's most popular team The Fabulous Ones (Steve Keirn and Stan Lane) for AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on 17 June 1985. The team was soon stripped of the titles due to excessive cheating but had the titles returned to them when Boyd and Morgan threatened to sue CWA management. Instead of taking the titles from the Sheepherders by stripping them the Fabulous Ones took the Southern tag team titles from them the old fashioned way ‚Äì 4 times in a row between 5 September and 12 October. After the series of violent matches with the Fabulous Ones came to an end the Sheepherders came face to face with another team that would turn out to be a constant thorn in their side The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). Jonathan Boyd reunited with the Sheepherders in the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. In the winter of 1985 the Kiwi Sheepherders and the Fantastics traded wins back and forth with no side gaining a clear advantage in their feud. In January 1986 the Kiwi Sheepherders defeated the teams of Koko Ware and Rick Casey and also the team of Tojo Yamamoto and Dirty Rhodes to reach the finals of a tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions, but in the finals they fell to the Fantastics. The loss to the Fantastics only intensified the Sheepherders' anger bringing the feud to its high point as the two teams clashed in a \\"No DQ Loser Leaves Town\\" match on 20 January 1986. The Kiwi Sheepherders lost and left Memphis while the Fantastics rode a wave of popularity thanks to the feud. =The Thing, Rip Morgan (1987‚Äì1988)= Following the dissolution of the Sheepherders Morgan ended up worked for Fritz Von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas under the ring name \\"The Thing\\" and later on \\"The Real Thing\\". In Texas he lost to Kerry Von Erich on WCCW's \\"Thanksgiving Star Wars\\" show in 1987. Later on Morgan joined Jim Crockett Promotions, later known as World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He worked the 1988 Great American Bash tour facing Bugsy McGraw on several stops of the tour. Later on Morgan and Jonathan Holliday teamed up to challenge for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship but lost to The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers. At Clash of the Champions V special event Rip Morgan lost to Rick Steiner. Two months later he challenged Sting for the NWA World Television Championship at Clash of the Champions VII but again was unsuccessful in his efforts. =Teaming with Jack Victory (1989‚Äì1993)= In 1989 the bookers of World Championship Wrestling decided to put Rip Morgan together with another former flagbearer of the Sheepherders, Jack Victory, creating a tag team known as the \\"New Zealand Militia\\", billing Jack Victory as a native of New Zealand despite being born in the United States. The two made their in-ring debut on 14 June 1989 where they took part in a tournament for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship. The team faced and lost to The Dynamic Dudes (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace, also a former flag bearer for the Sheepherders). Following the tournament loss the Militia found themselves frequently facing off against the Dynamic Dudes over the summer and fall of 1989. In 1990 WCW gave Morgan and Victory a new image, re-introducing them as \\"The Royal Family\\", naming them Ripper Morgan and Jack O'Victory and adding the manager Lord Littlebrook to the group. The Royal Family were billed as descendants of British Royalty. The Royal Family family was one of eight teams entered in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Tag Team Championship. The group lost in the first round to eventual tournament winners Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk. WCW held the \\"Pat O'Connor International Tag Team Tournament\\" as part of the 1990 Starrcade with eight teams representing various countries. The storyline was that the Royal Family had won a tournament in Australia to earn the rights to represent Australian and New Zealand, in reality none of the teams had won qualifying tournaments. Victory and Morgan lost to \\"Team Japan\\" (Masa Saito and The Great Muta) in the first round of the tournament. The Royal Family's last significant appearance with WCW was on 28 April 1991 where they teamed up with Black Bart as they unsuccessfully challenged the team of the Junkyard Dog, Ricky Morton and Tommy Rich for the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. In 1991 Victory and Morgan made their way to the Global Wrestling Federation in Dallas TX this time as The Maulers. The duo competed in the tournament for the first ever GWF Tag Team Championship. In the first round they defeated \\"Wet'n'Wild\\" (Steve Ray and Sunny Beach), followed by a victory over Chaz and Terry Garvin. In the third round, the semi-finals of the tournament the Maulers lost to eventual tournament winners Chris Walker and Steve Simpson. Wrestling as the Maulers, Victory and Morgan also wrestled a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in Mobile, Alabama on March 9, 1992, defeating Jim Cooper and John Allen.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm The Maulers did not stay in the GWF after the tournament, instead moved on to Smokey Mountain Wrestling (SMW) in Tennessee. They competed in a tournament to determine the first ever SMW Tag Team Champion. In the first round the Maulers defeated the Rich Brothers (Davey Rich and Johnny Rich), but lost to The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Jackie Fulton) in the second round to be eliminated from the tournament. Their short lived run in SMW was the last time Morgan and Victory teamed together on a regular basis. =Retirement and Kiwi Pro Wrestling CEO= In the early 1990s, Morgan wrestled in Germany, known for performing a Maori Haka before each match. In the late 1990s Rip Morgan retired from full-time wrestling and returned to his native New Zealand and began promoting wrestling. He later became the CEO of the Wellington-based professional wrestling promotion Kiwi Pro Wrestling.

Situated along the Malibu coast, the park is a component of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. With of beach, the parkland stretches into the Santa Monica Mountains. The park has expanded into Ventura County and also includes management of County Line Beach. California State Route 1 runs through the park, where it intersects with the western terminus of the Mulholland Highway. The park was established in 1953. It is named for actor and conservationist Leo Carrillo (1881‚Äì1961), who served on the State Parks commission. History The Woolsey Fire was a destructive wildfire that started inland many miles away and raced through canyons and mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties to the coastline. The fire ignited on November 8, 2018 and burned of land. The fire destroyed 1,643 structures, killed three people, and prompted the evacuation of more than 295,000 people. It was one of several fires in California that ignited on the same day. The 2018 fire burned through almost the entire park. The equipment for the Junior Lifeguard program that was destroyed in the fire was replaced by a donation from a group of Australian surf lifeguard associations, led by the Maroochydore Surf Life Saving Club. The campgrounds reopened after work crews spent seven months removing debris and cleaning up. Recreation Leo Carrillo State Park offers swimming, surfing, windsurfing, surf fishing, and beachcombing. Beachgoers can explore tide pools, sea caves, and reefs. Inland there is a campground and backcountry hiking trails.

The term probably refers to a misunderstanding of the French word , which in this context simply means search. Declaration of London The regulation of naval search during time of war was codified as part of the Declaration of London (1903). However, no state ratified the declaration so it had no force in international law.Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War, icrc.org. The intent of the declaration was as follows. The right of search belongs to belligerents alone. Its object is to verify the nationality of the vessel and if neutral to ascertain whether it carries contraband. The consequence of resistance to search is capture and trial in a Prize court. Article 63 of the Declaration states that \\"Forcible resistance to the legitimate exercise of the right of stoppage, search and capture involves in all cases the condemnation of the vessel. The cargo is liable to the same treatment as the cargo of an enemy vessel. Goods belonging to the master or owner of the vessel are treated as enemy goods.\\" At the Hague Convention of 1907, the question of the liability to search of mail-ships gave rise to much discussion based on incidents arising out of the Boer and Russo-Japanese Wars. It was ultimately decided under a separate article of the Hague conference that postal correspondence of neutrals and even of belligerents, and whether official or private, found on board a neutral or even an enemy ship should be \\"inviolable\\", and that though the ship should be detained, this correspondence had to be forwarded to its destination by the captor \\"with the least possible delay.\\" The only exception to this exemption is correspondence destined for or proceeding from a blockaded port. As regards the mail-ships themselves, apart from this inviolability of the correspondence, no exemption or privilege is extended beyond the injunction that they should not be searched, except when absolutely necessary, and then only \\"with as much consideration and expedition as possible,\\" which might just as well be said of all ships stopped or searched in international waters. U.S. Navy According to the U.S. Navy, :\\"Under the law of armed conflict, belligerent warships or aircraft may visit and search a merchant vessel for the purpose of determining its true character, i.e., enemy or neutral, nature of cargo, manner of employment, and other facts bearing on its relation to the conflict. Such visits occur outside neutral territorial seas. This right does not extend to visiting or searching warships or vessels engaged in government non-commercial service. In addition, neutral merchant vessels in convoy of neutral warships are exempt from visit and search, although the convoy commander may be required to certify the neutral character of merchant vessels' cargo.\\"  See also  * Law of Armed Conflict * Blockade  References  * OPNAVINST 3120.32C 11 April 1994, section 630.23 Category:Law of the sea ","title":"Visit and Search"},{"id":"2426037","text":"The Bill Hunter Trophy was presented to the World Hockey Association's scoring leader in the regular season.

He was the father of Louis Adolphe le Doulcet and Philippe Gustave le Doulcet. Biography =Early life and National Convention= Born in Caen on the 1764, he began a military career with the Compagnie √âcossaise of the Garde du corps du Roi in 1778, becoming Lieutenant Colonel in 1791. A moderate supporter of the French Revolution, he was elected to the National Convention for the d√©partment of Calvados in 1792, and became commissioner with the Army of the North during the French Revolutionary Wars. He voted for the imprisonment of King Louis XVI during the war, and his banishment after the peace. He then attached himself to the Girondists, voting in favor of Jean-Paul Marat's prosecution, and was consequently declared an enemy of the people in August 1793,. being pursued by the Reign of Terror and taking refuge to Switzerland. In July, Charlotte Corday, the assassin of Marat, asked Le Doulcet to defend her, but he did not receive in time her letter so Claude Fran√ßois Chauveau-Lagarde was appointed instead to assist her during the trial.\\"N'ayant pu √™tre repr√©sent√©e par le d√©fenseur qu'elle s'√©tait choisie; le d√©put√© girondin Doulcet de Pont√©coulant (il existe une hypoth√®se selon laquelle Fouquier-Tinville aurait fait en sorte qu'il soit averti trop tard), c'est l'avocat Claude-Fran√ßois Chauveau-Lagarde, pr√©sent √† l'audience qui va √™tre d√©sign√© par le pr√©sident du Tribunal r√©volutionnaire pour assurer sa d√©fense\\" . However, it is said that Corday thought that Le Doulcet refused to defend her and sent to him a last letter of reproach just before going to the scaffold. =Thermidor and Directory= He returned to the Thermidorian Convention on 8 March 1795, and was noted for his moderation, especially after defending Prieur de la Marne and Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet. President of the Convention in July 1795, he was for some months a member of the Council of Public Safety. Doulcet was subsequently elected to the French Directory's Council of Five Hundred, but was suspected of Royalist sympathies, and had to spend some time in retirement between anti-monarchist coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) and the establishment of the Consulate (the 18 Brumaire coup of 9 November 1799). =Empire and Restoration= Becoming senator of the First French Empire in 1805, and count of the Empire in 1808, he organized the national guard in Franche-Comt√© in 1811, and the defence of the north-eastern frontier in 1813. During the 1814 Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII made him a Peer of France, and although he received a similar honor from Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he remained in the upper house after the return of the king. He died in Paris, leaving memoirs and correspondence from which were extracted four volumes (1861‚Äì1865) of Souvenirs historiques et parlementaires, 1764-1848.

It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. This field of research is based heavily on Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path on a weighted graph. Pathfinding is closely related to the shortest path problem, within graph theory, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network.  Algorithms  At its core, a pathfinding method searches a graph by starting at one vertex and exploring adjacent nodes until the destination node is reached, generally with the intent of finding the cheapest route. Although graph searching methods such as a breadth-first search would find a route if given enough time, other methods, which \\"explore\\" the graph, would tend to reach the destination sooner. An analogy would be a person walking across a room; rather than examining every possible route in advance, the person would generally walk in the direction of the destination and only deviate from the path to avoid an obstruction, and make deviations as minor as possible. Two primary problems of pathfinding are (1) to find a path between two nodes in a graph; and (2) the shortest path problem‚Äîto find the optimal shortest path. Basic algorithms such as breadth-first and depth-first search address the first problem by exhausting all possibilities; starting from the given node, they iterate over all potential paths until they reach the destination node. These algorithms run in O(V+E), or linear time, where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges between vertices. The more complicated problem is finding the optimal path. The exhaustive approach in this case is known as the Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm, which yields a time complexity of O(VE), or quadratic time. However, it is not necessary to examine all possible paths to find the optimal one. Algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm strategically eliminate paths, either through heuristics or through dynamic programming. By eliminating impossible paths, these algorithms can achieve time complexities as low as O(E\\\\log(V)). The above algorithms are among the best general algorithms which operate on a graph without preprocessing. However, in practical travel- routing systems, even better time complexities can be attained by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance. One such algorithm is contraction hierarchies. =Dijkstra's algorithm= A common example of a graph-based pathfinding algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm begins with a start node and an \\"open set\\" of candidate nodes. At each step, the node in the open set with the lowest distance from the start is examined. The node is marked \\"closed\\", and all nodes adjacent to it are added to the open set if they have not already been examined. This process repeats until a path to the destination has been found. Since the lowest distance nodes are examined first, the first time the destination is found, the path to it will be the shortest path. Dijkstra's algorithm fails if there is a negative edge weight. In the hypothetical situation where Nodes A, B, and C form a connected undirected graph with edges AB = 3, AC = 4, and BC = ‚àí2, the optimal path from A to C costs 1, and the optimal path from A to B costs 2. Dijkstra's Algorithm starting from A will first examine B, as that is the closest. It will assign a cost of 3 to it, and mark it closed, meaning that its cost will never be reevaluated. Therefore, Dijkstra's cannot evaluate negative edge weights. However, since for many practical purposes there will never be a negative edgeweight, Dijkstra's algorithm is largely suitable for the purpose of pathfinding. =A* algorithm= A* is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm commonly used in games. A* assigns a weight to each open node equal to the weight of the edge to that node plus the approximate distance between that node and the finish. This approximate distance is found by the heuristic, and represents a minimum possible distance between that node and the end. This allows it to eliminate longer paths once an initial path is found. If there is a path of length x between the start and finish, and the minimum distance between a node and the finish is greater than x, that node need not be examined. A* uses this heuristic to improve on the behavior relative to Dijkstra's algorithm. When the heuristic evaluates to zero, A* is equivalent to Dijkstra's algorithm. As the heuristic estimate increases and gets closer to the true distance, A* continues to find optimal paths, but runs faster (by virtue of examining fewer nodes). When the value of the heuristic is exactly the true distance, A* examines the fewest nodes. (However, it is generally impractical to write a heuristic function that always computes the true distance, as the same comparison result can often be reached using simpler calculations ‚Äì for example, using Manhattan distance over Euclidean distance in two-dimensional space.) As the value of the heuristic increases, A* examines fewer nodes but no longer guarantees an optimal path. In many applications (such as video games) this is acceptable and even desirable, in order to keep the algorithm running quickly. = Sample algorithm = This is a fairly simple and easy-to-understand pathfinding algorithm for tile-based maps. To start off, you have a map, a start coordinate and a destination coordinate. The map will look like this, \`X\` being walls, \`S\` being the start, \`O\` being the finish and \`_\` being open spaces, the numbers along the top and right edges are the column and row numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 X X X X X X X X X X X _ _ _ X X _ X _ X 1 X _ X _ _ X _ _ _ X 2 X S X X _ _ _ X _ X 3 X _ X _ _ X _ _ _ X 4 X _ _ _ X X _ X _ X 5 X _ X _ _ X _ X _ X 6 X _ X X _ _ _ X _ X 7 X _ _ O _ X _ _ _ X 8 X X X X X X X X X X First, create a list of coordinates, which we will use as a queue. The queue will be initialized with one coordinate, the end coordinate. Each coordinate will also have a counter variable attached (the purpose of this will soon become evident). Thus, the queue starts off as ((3,8,0)). Then, go through every element in the queue, including elements added to the end over the course of the algorithm, and to each element, do the following: # Create a list of the four adjacent cells, with a counter variable of the current element's counter variable + 1 (in our example, the four cells are ((2,8,1),(3,7,1),(4,8,1),(3,9,1))) # Check all cells in each list for the following two conditions: ## If the cell is a wall, remove it from the list ## If there is an element in the main list with the same coordinate and a more than or equal counter, remove it from the cells list # Add all remaining cells in the list to the end of the main list # Go to the next item in the list Thus, after turn 1, the list of elements is this: ((3,8,0),(2,8,1),(4,8,1)) * After 2 turns: ((3,8,0),(2,8,1),(4,8,1),(1,8,2),(4,7,2)) * After 3 turns: (...(1,7,3),(4,6,3),(5,7,3)) * After 4 turns: (...(1,6,4),(3,6,4),(6,7,4)) * After 5 turns: (...(1,5,5),(3,5,5),(6,6,5),(6,8,5)) * After 6 turns: (...(1,4,6),(2,5,6),(3,4,6),(6,5,6),(7,8,6)) * After 7 turns: (...(1,3,7)) ‚Äì problem solved, end this stage of the algorithm ‚Äì note that if you have multiple units chasing the same target (as in many games ‚Äì the finish to start approach of the algorithm is intended to make this easier), you can continue until the entire map is taken up, all units are reached or a set counter limit is reached Now, map the counters onto the map, getting this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 X X X X X X X X X X X _ _ _ X X _ X _ X 1 X _ X _ _ X _ _ _ X 2 X S X X _ _ _ X _ X 3 X 6 X 6 _ X _ _ _ X 4 X 5 6 5 X X 6 X _ X 5 X 4 X 4 3 X 5 X _ X 6 X 3 X X 2 3 4 X _ X 7 X 2 1 0 1 X 5 6 _ X 8 X X X X X X X X X X Now, start at S (7) and go to the nearby cell with the lowest number (unchecked cells cannot be moved to). The path traced is (1,3,7) -> (1,4,6) -> (1,5,5) -> (1,6,4) -> (1,7,3) -> (1,8,2) -> (2,8,1) -> (3,8,0). In the event that two numbers are equally low (for example, if S was at (2,5)), pick a random direction ‚Äì the lengths are the same. The algorithm is now complete.  In video games  Chris Crawford in 1982 described how he \\"expended a great deal of time\\" trying to solve a problem with pathfinding in Tanktics, in which computer tanks became trapped on land within U-shaped lakes. \\"After much wasted effort I discovered a better solution: delete U-shaped lakes from the map\\", he said. =Hierarchical path finding= Quadtrees can be used for hierarchical path finding The idea was first described by the video game industry, which had a need for planning in large maps with a low amount of CPU time. The concept of using abstraction and heuristics is older and was first mentioned under the name ABSTRIPS (Abstraction-Based STRIPS) which was used to efficiently search the state spaces of logic games. A similar technique are navigation meshes (navmesh), which are used for geometrical planning in games and multimodal transportation planning which is utilized in travelling salesman problems with more than one transport vehicle. A map is separated into clusters. On the high-level layer, the path between the clusters is planned. After the plan was found, a second path is planned within a cluster on the lower level. That means, the planning is done in two steps which is a guided local search in the original space. The advantage is, that the number of nodes is smaller and the algorithm performs very well. The disadvantage is, that a hierarchical pathplanner is difficult to implement. Example A map has a size of 3000x2000 pixels. Planning a path on a pixel base would take very long. Even an efficient algorithm will need to compute many possible graphs. The reason is, that such a map would contain 6 million pixels overall and the possibilities to explore the geometrical space are exceedingly large. The first step for a hierarchical path planner is to divide the map into smaller sub-maps. Each cluster has a size of 300x200 pixel. The number of clusters overall is 10x10=100. In the newly created graph the amount of nodes is small, it is possible to navigate between the 100 clusters, but not within the detailed map. If a valid path was found in the high-level-graph the next step is to plan the path within each cluster. The submap has 300x200 pixel which can be handled by a normal A* pathplanner easily.  Algorithms used in pathfinding  *A* search algorithm *Dijkstra's algorithm, a special case of the A* search algorithm *D* a family of incremental heuristic search algorithms for problems in which constraints vary over time or are not completely known when the agent first plans its path *Any-angle path planning algorithms, a family of algorithms for planning paths that are not restricted to move along the edges in the search graph, designed to be able to take on any angle and thus find shorter and straighter paths  Multi-agent Pathfinding  Multi-agent pathfinding is to find the paths for multiple agents from their current locations to their target locations without colliding with each other, while at the same time optimizing a cost function, such as the sum of the path lengths of all agents. It is a generalization of pathfinding. Many multi-agent pathfinding algorithms are generalized from A*, or based on reduction to other well studied problems such as integer linear programming.Hang Ma, Sven Koenig, Nora Ayanian, Liron Cohen, Wolfgang Hoenig, T. K. Satish Kumar, Tansel Uras, Hong Xu, Craig Tovey, and Guni Sharon. Overview: generalizations of multi-agent path finding to real-world scenarios. In the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) Workshop on Multi-Agent Path Finding. 2016. However, such algorithms are typically incomplete; in other words, not proven to produce a solution within polynomial time. A different category of algorithms sacrifice optimality for performance by either making use of known navigation patterns (such as traffic flow) or the topology of the problem space.

The screenplay was written by Rebecca Miller and David Auburn, based on Auburn's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Proof. Plot The plot alternates between events immediately following the death of Robert (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant mathematician whose genius was undone by crippling mental illness, and flashbacks revealing the life he shared with his daughter Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow). Catherine is also a mathematician, but she struggles with living in her father's shadow, with balancing her demanding studies with caring for her father and also with the fear that she may have inherited his mental illness. At home, Robert clings to sanity by constantly bombarding Catherine with complex mathematical problems. In the opening scene Robert startles Catherine while she watches TV in the middle of the night. He gives her a bottle of champagne for her birthday, and they chat for a while about the nature of insanity, ending with the revelation that Robert died last week and his funeral is tomorrow. Awakened from this dream, Catherine realizes that Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a former graduate student of Robert's, is still upstairs, reading through Robert's books. Robert filled many notebooks with meaningless notes. Hal believes that Robert's genius may have withstood his illness, and clues to that genius might lie among the gibberish of his notebooks. When Hal comments on the vast amount of work Robert did, a suspicious Catherine searches Hal's backpack. Though Catherine finds nothing in Hal's bag, a notebook falls out of his coat. He explains that he wanted to give the notebook as a birthday present because it \\"had something written in it about her, not math, her\\". Hal is forced to leave, giving the notebook as intended, when Catherine calls the police. The next day, for the funeral, Catherine's sister Claire (Hope Davis) arrives in town. A huge contrast to the unkempt Catherine, Claire is an overly put together, neurotic New Yorker. Relations between the sisters are tense, and Catherine cannot stand her sister's constant harping on matters of appearance. Catherine is also upset that Claire didn't care for her father as much as Catherine did in his final years. At the funeral, Catherine expresses her frustration with the many people there. She interrupts the string quartet with an impromptu speech, berating everyone for not being there for her father while he was alive. She describes his descent into insanity, and that at one time he would borrow piles of books believing that aliens were sending him messages encoded in their Dewey Decimal codes. She ends by saying she's glad her father is dead and walks out of the church mid-funeral. Claire decides to sell Robert's house back to the university and wants Catherine to come with her to New York; Catherine is upset that she will be forced to leave the house. It becomes evident that Claire suspects that Catherine may be struggling with mental illnesses, as their father had. A wake held at the house the night after the funeral is attended by many academic mathematicians. Hal appears and chats up Catherine. Softening up to Hal, Catherine sleeps with him. Afterwards, she gives him a key to her father's desk. In flashbacks, Robert is shown suddenly invigorated, believing he has seen the beginnings of a new mathematical proof that will prove his triumph over mental illness. In the present, Catherine gives Hal a key to Robert's desk and tells him to check the locked drawer for a notebook, which itself contains a lengthy but apparently very important proof. He is very excited and shows the discovery to Catherine and Claire. He asks Catherine how long she knew about this and why she did not tell him about it. She tells him that she wrote it. Catherine claims the work is hers and not her father's despite evidence to the contrary. Neither Hal nor Claire believe Catherine. Hal believes the mathematics of the proof are beyond Catherine, while Claire simply suspects that Catherine is suffering the onset of mental illness. Catherine says she can't describe the proof without the notebook because it \\"is not a muffin recipe\\". Hal decides to take it to the math department the next day to verify the proof's accuracy. He returns as Claire and Catherine are leaving, with news that the math department believes the proof to be valid. Hal tells Claire that he doesn't think that her father wrote the proof because it employs newer mathematics and wants Catherine to explain it to him sometime. Catherine remains stung by his earlier lack of trust, and the sisters leave for the airport; but, Hal sprints after the car and throws the book through the window and onto Catherine's lap. At the airport, Catherine has another flashback. It is revealed that, while living together, her father challenged her to work on math, which she does, ultimately completing a proof, which she describes in one of the many notebooks in the house. Catherine goes to tell her father about the breakthrough, but he insists she read aloud the proof that he is working on. To Catherine's disappointment, Robert's notebook contains not a proof, but a rambling and desperate observation of the passage of the seasons, that the year is divided into months of cold, months of warmth and months of indeterminate temperature, that the future of heat is the future of cold, that the future of cold is infinite, and that he will never be as cold as he will be in the future. Reading her father's work, Catherine realizes that Robert has not overcome his mental illness. A dispirited Catherine leaves her notebook in Robert's desk, where Hal will later find it. Catherine has begun to come to terms with herself, aided by Hal's confidence in her. She decides that she does not need to go with her sister to New York and runs out of the airport. She returns to University of Chicago, and the film ends with her and Hal meeting up on campus and discussing the proof. Cast * Gwyneth Paltrow as Catherine Llewellyn, the protagonist * Anthony Hopkins as Robert Llewellyn, Catherine and Claire's father * Jake Gyllenhaal as Harold \\"Hal\\" Dobbs, a former student of Robert's * Hope Davis as Claire Llewellyn, Catherine's sister Production The film is based on the four- character stage play Proof. The film adds many bit parts for the sake of realism, and \\"opens up\\" the setting considerably. The role of Catherine was first played by Mary-Louise Parker in the play's 2000 Manhattan Theatre Club original production. Gwyneth Paltrow played Catherine in a London stage production before being cast in the film. Hopkins' character is a mathematics professor at the University of Chicago. Although many scenes were filmed on the university's campus, the mathematics building itself (Eckhart Hall) was not used. Instead, many scenes that were set in the math building were actually shot at the Divinity School. The film opens with a pan of Gwyneth Paltrow's character bicycling across the Midway Plaisance and shows many scenes in the quadrangle before Harper Library. Reception =Critical reception and box office= Proof received generally positive reviews from film critics. As of January 2012, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes scored a 63% rating, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10, based on 139 reviews. Proof opened at #35 in its opening weekend with $193,840 and went on to gross a mild $7,535,331 in the USA and $14,189,860 worldwide.\\"Proof (2005)\\". Box Office Mojo. IMDb.

In 2006, mathematician Daniel Ullman wrote: \\"Of [the first] three films, Proof is the one that most realistically illustrates the world of mathematics and mathematicians.\\" Ullman praised the director too: \\"Madden should be credited with capturing the feeling of the mathematical world.\\"\\"Movie Review: Proof\\".

Created as a US Forest Reserve in 1897, it is one of the oldest government- protected forest lands in the U.S. The forest is well east of the continental divide and extends from the Montana border for a distance of 80 miles (130 km) along the spine of the Bighorn Mountains, an outlying mountain range separated from the rest of the Rocky Mountains by Bighorn Basin. Elevations range from 5,000 feet (1,500 m) along the sagebrush and grass-covered lowlands at the foot of the mountains, to 13,189 feet (4,020 m) on top of Cloud Peak, the highest point in the Bighorn Mountains. Around 99% of the land is above . The forest is named after the Bighorn River, which is partially fed by streams found in the forest. Streams in the range are fed primarily by snowmelt and snowmelt mixed with driving rainfall. Within the forest is the Cloud Peak Wilderness area in which no motorized or mechanical equipment is allowed. The only access into the 189,000 acre (765 km¬≤) wildernessForest Service is on foot or horseback. There are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of trails in the forest, along with 32 improved campgrounds, lodges, and three scenic vehicular byways. U.S. Route 14 in Wyoming, also known as the Bighorn Scenic Byway, crosses the middle of the 30-mile (48 km) wide forest. The Medicine Wheel Passage (U.S. Highway 14A) crosses in the north passing the Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark, while the Cloud Peak Skyway (U.S. Route 16) crosses the highest pass in the forest (Powder River Pass 9,677 ft/ 2,950 m) and is located in the southern section of the forest. The forest headquarters is located in Sheridan, Wyoming. There are local ranger district offices in Buffalo, Lovell, and Sheridan.USFS Ranger Districts by State Visitor centers are located at Burgess Junction and near Shell Falls. History The Bighorn National Forest was established as the Big Horn National Forest in 22 February 1897, and encompasses 1,198,080 acres. On 1 July 1908 the name was changed to the Bighorn National Forest through an executive order. In September 1981 the national forest had 1,115,171 acres, with 1,107,670 of those acres being National Forest land. Men work on the Dayton-Kane road over the mountains in the 1920s Ecology and recreation The Bighorn National Forest contains primarily forest along with alpine meadows and lakes at higher elevations. The forest is primarily lodgepole pine, along with several species of spruce, fir, and aspen. While grizzly bears have not inhabited the forest since the early 20th century, black bears are widespread. Other large mammals include cougars, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, and moose. Coyotes are also present in this forest. Numerous lakes are found within the forest and most are naturally stocked with trout and at least 100 other fish species. Meadowlark Lake is a popular recreation area created by the construction of a dam built by Company 841 of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936. Water quality sampling from the lakes shows the highest acid rain deposition of any mountain chain in the Rockies.

The camera was launched at the Photo Marketing Association Annual Show on February 18, 2002. It was Sigma's first digital camera, and was the first production camera to use the unique Foveon X3 image sensor, which reads full color at each pixel site. Other sensors detect only one color at each site and interpolate to produce a full- color image. The SD9 had two separate power systems; one set of CR-123A lithium batteries in the handgrip powered the camera functions, while another pair of CR-V3 batteries or four AA size rechargeable batteries in a battery tray in the base powered the digital functions. This split power system showed that the camera functions (inherited from Sigma's SA-9 film SLR) were not integrated at all with the digital half. Another unusual feature of the SD9 was its \\"dust cover\\" filter right behind the lens mount, to prevent dust getting into the chamber and onto the sensor when changing lenses. Reviewers and users reported good results in good lighting, but poorer ones in low light using either high ISO sensitivity or longer exposures. The SD9 was succeeded by an updated model, the SD10, which addressed the power and low-light issues.http://vividlight.com/articles/3212.htmhttp://www.imaging- resource.com/PRODS/SSD10/SD10P.HTM  Software  = Sigma Photo Pro = Postprocessing of raw X3F and JPEG of all digital SIGMA cameras Version 6.x is free Download for Windows 7+ und Mac OS ab Version 10.7 (6.3.x).Actual Versions are 6.5.4 (Win 7+) and 6.5.5 (MacOSX 10.9+).http://www.sigma- global.com/en/download/cameras/sigma-photo-pro/ References  External links  * Review at dpreview.com. * Sigma USA page on the SD9. * SD9 user image galleries * SD 9 CNET specs * SD 9 Manual PDF SD09 Category:Cameras introduced in 2002 ","title":"Sigma SD9"},{"id":"2426093","text":"The Ben Hatskin Trophy was presented annually to the World Hockey Association's best goaltender.

In the Assembl√©e nationale he published his Causeries litteraires, a series of attacks on prominent Liberals, which created some sensation. Pontmartin was an indefatigable journalist, and most of his papers were eventually published in volume form: Contes et reveries d'un planteur de choux (1845); Causeries du samedi (1857-1860); Nouveaux samedis (1865-1881), &c.; But the most famous of all his books is Les Jeudis de Mme.

They are recognised by their dark head and pale or translucent legs and gaster (abdomen). This colouring makes this tiny ant seem even smaller. Description Zoomed up photo of a ghost ant worker, taken from a site in East London The ghost ant is small, with average lengths ranging between in workers. The antennae composes of 12 segments that thickens towards the tip. The antennal scapes exceeds the occipital border. The head and thorax is a dark brown colour while the gaster, legs and antennae are a milky white colour. Due to its small size and light colour, the ghost ant is difficult to see. Ghost ants are monomorphic and the thorax is spineless. The gaster is hairless, and has a back opening that is similar to a slit-like opening. The abdominal pedicel is formed upon a single segment that is usually unable to be seen due to the gaster, and the species do not contain a stinger. During development, this species undergoes three larval instars, which are all naked and fusiform, with reduced mouthparts. The queens are similar in appearance to a worker, but the alitrunk (mesosoma) is enlarged. The queen measures in length, making them the largest member of the colony. The male's head and dorsum is dark in colour, while the gaster is light in that may contain several dark marks. They are usually in length. Distribution and habitat Due to how widespread the ghost ant is, the exact native range is not exactly known. However, the species is assumed to originate from the African or Oriental regions, seeing it is a tropical species. This has been proven considering the ghost ant cannot adapt to colder climates and are only confined to greenhouses and buildings that provide considerable conditions that allows the species to thrive, although a colony of ghost ants was discovered in an apartment block in Canada. One report has even stated the presence of ghost ants in isolated regions, with a colony being found in the Galapagos Islands. The ant is found in 154 geographical areas. The species is a common pest in the United States, particularly in the states of Hawaii and Florida, although the species is expanding further north, even reaching Texas by the mid 1990s. They are commonly found in the southern parts of Florida, and is considered a key pest, along with several other invasive ant species. The earliest record of the ghost ant in the United States was in 1887, where the species was found in Hawaii. It was then recorded in Washington, D.C. in 1894. After these two records, the ghost ant would later be found in Maine, New York, Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Louisiana, Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington. Ghost ants can be found in the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

He spent the majority of his career in Minnesota-based Pro Wrestling America (PWA), where he became a five-time Heavyweight Champion and a two-time Tag Team Champion.

The paper was founded in 1891 and is the third oldest extant Brazilian paper, after the Di√°rio de Pernambuco and O Estado de S. Paulo. On 31 August 2010 it became a digital newspaper, folding its print edition until 25 February 2018, when it was printed again. History It is often believed that the newspaper was founded by former supporters of the deposed monarchy and sported conservative views in its early decades. However at the time, the monarchy was leading the fight for the end of slavery so can be considered liberal for the period. Many important Brazilian writers and journalists eventually worked for Jornal do Brasil, especially after the 1964 coup d'√©tat. Jornal do Brasil was an important opponent for challenging censorship although it never was radically against the dictatorship and its editors did not follow a rebellious line against the government, rather they avoided such conflict. At times however, but to a lesser extent than the S√£o Paulo paper 'Estad√£o' they replaced censored news with cake recipes, or news from articles on international news instead of polemic Brazilian stories What some people do not realise that the newspaper made its great profits from the advertisement it sold, it had a times up to 5 supplements on different areas of the Rio market. To seel almost anything in Rio de Janeiro, the main city in Brazil at the time, you had to advertise in JB. News was of secondary consequence until its owner, the countess, decided to change the line of the paper to a more standard journal that its journalism was taken more seriously. In 1992 the paper published an unflattering photo of Henry Kissinger on the front page. Kissinger's lawyer sent a cease and desist letter threatening to sue them if they sold the photo. The newspaper refused and one of the buyers was the advertising agency Woolward & Partners who used it in an advertisement for computer equipment. Woolward & Partners was also threatened with legal action. The photograph was also used in the 1996 book Washington Babylon by Alexander Cockburn and Ken Silverstein. The paper suffered after the Brazilian boom years having too much credit in dollar. With the oil crisis their stocks fell and they suffered until they were sold JB was the first Brazilian newspaper to have an electronic edition which included partial PDF-publishing. In 2002, it was sold to businessman Nelson Tanure who restructured it again. It still holds slightly left positions, compared to its major rival, O Globo. JB is pictured in the Academy Award-nominated film Cidade de Deus, as the newspaper where the main character, Buscap√©, begins working as a photographer. The movie is set in Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s-1980s, the golden age of the paper, before it started its long decaying period. On 31 August 2010, JB ceased its printed version, becoming online-only until 25 February 2018, when it was relaunched at Rio's newsstands. The ending of the printed version.

Founded by J. M. Harder, the school was purchased five years later by I. P. Rosser. In 1895, he sold it to the Methodist Protestant Church and the school was named Westminster College and served as a preparatory school for ministers. Shortly thereafter, the town of Seven Points changed its name to that of the school. In 1902, Westminster outgrew the facilities and the college moved to Tehuacana, Texas and continued as a junior college. In 1950, the Westminster College closed and three years later the property was sold. The Congregational Methodist Church acquired the property and relocated their bible school from Dallas, Texas. The school's program was expanded to include a junior college and the institution was named Westminster College and Bible Institute. The campus included twelve buildings and the curriculum expanded to include a four-year degree, the bachelor of religion. In 1968-69 there were fifteen faculty members and ninety-five students, but by 1970 the student body had decreased to sixty.

Mojiganga is often credited as being among the most representative bands of the Colombia's underground scene during the 90's and 2000's. They had remained independent and had put out six studio records, one live record and several singles for international compilations. * De Las No Alpacas (1996-Never released) * Estupidas Guerras (1997) * Se√±alados (1999) * No Estamos Solos (2001) * Todo Tiempo Pasado Fue Peor (2004) * Mojiganga (2007) * Ardiendo Otra Vez (2010) * Atomico (2013) * En Vivo 2017 (2017) The band has gone through several line-ups during its career but still preserve five of its founder members, they are actively playing (as of 2019) and still recording and producing videos.

The band, called Ensamble Cofrades did not have any original songs but its repertory consisted of rock en espa√±ol covers, religious songs, and ye-ye music. Discontented with the style and antics of the Franciscan order, Miguel (drums) and his cousin Guillo (guitar) began looking for members to start a ska-punk band, they first recruited Mauricio (keyboard) and Juan, that at the time was learning to play the bass. The band composed several songs with this line-up before bringing in Natalia (alto saxophone) and Daniel (trumpet) and their name Mojiganga was officially adopted in 1995. That same year they recorded their first album, De Las No Alpacas (1996). The album was recorded in a four track at Guillo's house. The production and composition value of the album was so poor that the band decided to never release it and instead focus on a more professional production the next year . At the end of 1997 they contacted Jorge Ceballos, owner of Estudios El Pez in Medellin and recorded Estupidas Guerras (1997). The album consisted of twelve songs and was released in cassette format under their label PUKA! Records. The album's songs contained a very distinctive style of what Medellin' punk music was at the time plus the addition of a fast horn section, and gritty vocals. The album was well received by the public and critics and positioned the band as one of the most important acts of the punk scene at the time.

John Buchanan is a King's Old Collegian (University of Queensland, Brisbane) and is also an old boy of The Southport School, located in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Buchanan is also known in cricketing circles as 'Ned Flanders', due to his similarity in appearance to The Simpsons character.A boffin who rode his luck Early career Buchanan had a brief first-class career with Queensland in 1978‚Äì79 in which he played in 7 matches and hit 160 runs. He also played league cricket in England including a spell at Hyde Cricket Club in Cheshire. Buchanan began his coaching career in England- he was player/coach/professional for Oldham in Central Lancashire league as well as Cambridgeshire in Minor Counties 1978 and 1979. Oldham won the League and Cup double in 1979 which was first time in some 40 odd years.Strength training can begin at a young age-Takath.com Prior to the senior coaching position, he had five successful years as the Queensland Bulls coach in which they won two Sheffield Shield titles, the victory in 1994‚Äì95 was the first in the state's history, and two Mercantile Mutual Cup wins. He also coached Middlesex in 1998. Australian coach Buchanan served as the coach of the Australian cricket team. Appointed in October 1999 to replace Geoff Marsh he was considered an unlikely candidate given that he had not played at the Test level as had his predecessors, Marsh and Bob Simpson. His initial results were very impressive however as he helped steer the team to unprecedented success. At one stage his record was 15 wins from 15 games played. However, his contributions have often been questioned by legends of the game including Ian Chappell, Sunil Gavaskar and even Shane Warne who played under him. The most common criticism has been that he inherited a very strong team and his presence just happened to coincide with their victories. Warne has consistently held that Buchanan tended to reinvent everything and complicate all aspects of the game.Warne rubbishes Buchanan's theory (Indiatimes) . Buchanan, along with former captain Ricky Ponting, led the side to numerous successes, including a world-record 16 consecutive Test match victories and 23 ODI victories in world cup tournaments, Buchanan only not involved in the first one, a 2001 and 2002‚Äì03 Ashes domination winning both series 4‚Äì1, the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup in South Africa, the 2004 tour of India, in which Australia hadn't won a series there in thirty-six years, and more recently, following their shock Ashes defeat, a whitewash of the Super Series that saw the Aussies up against a World XI. In late 2006 he helped the team to their first ever ICC Champions Trophy victory, after four previously failed attempts and followed this with a 5‚Äì0 whitewash in the 2006‚Äì07 Ashes Series, the first since the 1920‚Äì21 Series. In 2007 his team won their third consecutive world cup.

Graduating from Baltimore City College secondary school in 1908, Perlman worked as a reporter for the Baltimore American while studying political economy at Johns Hopkins University. He studied law at the University of Maryland School of Law, being admitted to the bar one year prior to receiving a law degree in 1912. He began working for The Evening Sun in 1910, first as a court reporter, and then as City Editor from 1913-1917\\\\. It was probably at this time that he got to know H. L. Mencken. Leaving newspaper work in 1917, Perlman began many years of public service, interspersed with private law practice. Initially he worked under then Attorney General of Maryland, Albert C. Ritchie, as an assistant in the State Law Department, then became Assistant Maryland Attorney General in 1918. With Ritchie's election to the Maryland governorship in 1919, he appointed Perlman Secretary of State. Legislation drafted by Perlman included the bill providing for women's voting. In the 1920s, Perlman was City Solicitor of Baltimore and established a private law practice; in the 1930s he served on a commission to revise city zoning laws and on the first Maryland Water Resources Commission; in the 1940s he advised Governor William Preston Lane, Jr. on issues such as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge construction and highway improvement. In Perlman's private law practice, he was noted for civil rights cases. Moving to the level of national politics, Perlman became the first Jewish U.S. Solicitor General, serving from 1947-1952 under President Harry S. Truman, where he chaired Truman's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization, and was noted for helping to write the 1948 and 1960 platforms for the Democratic National Convention.

It is composed of seven members, all of whom are appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Restrictions it can impose include a prohibition on music being played, re-routing parades to avoid contentious areas, or banning certain participants based on previous breaches of its determinations. Its rulings are usually enforced by either parade stewards or the police, though there are disputes as to whether this is done to the letter of the law in certain areas. The Commission acts under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. Parade organisers and participants are liable to arrest and prosecution for breaching any of the Commission's rulings, although no-one has been charged since the Commission was established in 1998. A section 6(7) offence has a maximum punishment of six months imprisonment or level five on the standard scale. The Commission was set up after the large-scale civil strife that followed the Drumcree conflict over an Orange Order parade in Portadown. It has come under strong criticism from the Order. The Grand Lodge of the Order has a policy of non- engagement with the Commission, although some private and district lodges, particularly those with contentious parades, have agreed to talk to it.

The game is related to Sepak Takraw. Similar games include Footbag net, Footvolley, Bossaball and Jianzi. The game is both played by two teams, indoors or outdoors, on a court that is about the size of a tennis court. The teams consist of one, two or four players in each side. The aim of the game is to kick a soft ball made out of rattan fragments, back and forth over a net in the middle of the court. The sport requires speed, agility and ball control. Washer version One version of Sipa uses a lead washer covered with cloth, which gets kicked. This version is played by both girls and boys, but girls tend to use the outside of their foot to manipulate the washer, while boys more often use the inside of the foot. Points are scored based on the number of kicks without the ball touching the ground. If the ball touches the ground one point is awarded to the opposing team. Rattan ball version This version uses a larger rattan woven ball with the same foot action. Sipa balls can be purchased online, which look like Hacky Sack balls. Originally, the rattan Sipa ball was 10 centimeters in diameter and made of woven rattan strips with symmetrical holes. The most defining feature of the game of Sipa is that the ball should only be touched with the legs anywhere from below the knee to the tip of the toes. The rattan ball can touch the ground. Simplified play (one on one, two on two, three on three, or four on four) A set of rules determines penalty points (such as the ball bouncing twice on the ground). The two teams play against each other until a set number of penalty points is reached by one of the teams. There is also a court version in which a rectangle is marked in grids. Grids denote zones, and dictate where players stand, and how points are allotted based on where the ball lands in the court. This game requires much coordination.

Originally called the Harbor Bridge, it was renamed after Daniel Hoan, one of the longest serving mayors of Milwaukee. It was designed by the firm Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendoff and in 1975 won the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Long Span Bridge Award. Although construction on the bridge lasted briefly from 1970 until 1972, it did not open to traffic until 1977 due to public backlash against the planned Milwaukee County freeway system. This halted completion of the connecting roadways and led to the Hoan Bridge being known as \\"The Bridge to Nowhere.\\" It was widely held that the bridge in its unfinished state was used as the site of a car chase scene in the movie The Blues Brothers, author Mathiew J. Prigge in a two part article on the bridges history for the Shepherd Express, pointed out that the film was actually shot two years after the bridge was opened in 1977, he identified the scenes as being filmed on another incomplete section of I-794. Eventually, the bridge connections were completed in 1998, when the Lake Parkway (Wisconsin Highway 794) opened between the bridge's southernmost exit, connecting the bridge between the Bay View neighborhood and downtown Milwaukee's southeastern tip. Closure and reconstruction The Hoan Bridge was temporarily closed on December 13, 2000, after two of the three support beams of the lakefront span failed, causing the north-bound lanes to buckle and sag by several feet and leaving the span in a near collapsed state. No motorists were injured when the bridge failed. On December 28, 2000, engineers used explosives to remove the damaged section. The southbound lanes were restricted to one lane in each direction for eight months while the damaged northbound span was reconstructed, and the remainder of the bridge underwent extensive rehabilitation and retrofitting. Two lanes in each direction were reintroduced on October 10, 2001, and the bridge was fully reopened the following month. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, at the time of its failure, the six lanes of the bridge had carried an average of only 36,590 cars per day. A total of $16 million was spent to demolish and replace the damaged section and retrofit the remainder of the bridge. Experts believe that improperly designed welds between the lower lateral bracing and floorbeams along with a period of extreme cold and snow led to the partial collapse of the Hoan Bridge. Rehabilitation A total rehabilitation of the bridge has been nearly completed (as of September 2016) in conjunction with related construction on I-794 and its interchange. The rehabilitation plan removed and replaced the bridge deck, other structural adjustments, and the cleaning and repainting of the bridge's steel. The improvements are expected to extend the life span of the bridge by 40 to 50 years. Light The Hoan Bridge In May 2018, a private campaign named \\"Light the Hoan bridge\\" was created to light up the bridge. The project will cost between $4 million and $5 million. As of January 30, 2020, founders of this group stated they were still on track to reach their goal of being lit by the time Milwaukee hosts the Democratic National Convention later that summer. The next fundraising milestone is set for mid-April. Gallery File:HoanBridge12042005.jpgThe underside of the bridge File:Hoan Bridge 2016.jpgBridge in 2016 after restoration project.

Watkins ¬©Copyrighted and Published (via Facebook) on February 14, 2016, Updated February 17, 2016 Unmasking a Murderer On July 19, 2005, Army Private First Class LaVena Johnson died amidst mysterious circumstances. All of the physical and forensic evidence available to military investigators suggested she was murdered. However, these investigators shamelessly chose to disregard this glaring evidence and instead classified Private Johnson‚Äôs death as a suicide. The totality of evidence surrounding Private Johnson‚Äôs execution-style death strongly suggests that the person who killed her is former four-star Army General Kevin P. Byrnes. He was third in seniority among the Army‚Äôs eleven generals at the time. Byrnes, who was appointed to his command position by President George W. Bush in November 2002, headed the Army‚Äôs Training and Doctrine Command (1st Cavalry Division), or TRADOC command. In this capacity, Byrnes supervised the recruitment and academic programs at thirty-three Army schools, from basic training to the war colleges. Private Johnson met General Byrnes in July 2005, just a couple of days before her death. As fate would have it, Private Johnson wrote his name in her personal notepad and told her father about her one-on-one conversation with him. She had no way of knowing at the time that Byrnes: (a) was engaged in an extramarital affair with a civilian female and (b) had been ordered by General Peter J. Schoomaker, the Army‚Äôs Chief of Staff, to end the affair. Byrnes, who was married, willfully disobeyed Schoomaker‚Äôs order, and instead elected to make his love affair more clandestine. In doing so, Byrnes risked being court-martialed for disobeying Schoomaker‚Äôs lawful and direct order. Extramarital affairs among military generals, while strictly prohibited by the military, are not unusual. Sometimes, these affairs lead to reckless, impulsive, and even criminal conduct as the participants do everything within their power to indulge in the affairs under a cloak of secrecy. The torrid love affair between General David Petreaus and his lover Paula Broadwell is a recent high profile example of this deceitful and reckless conduct. Like General Petreaus, General Byrnes‚Äô TRADOC command gave him the means and opportunity to practice the deception that accompanied his adultery. Also like Petraeus, Byrnes found ways to evade the Pentagon‚Äôs scrutiny of his extramarital affair, particularly after Byrnes was ordered to stop his affair. Like Petraeus, Byrnes‚Äô affair came to light only after an unanticipated event by an uninvolved person caused its exposure. In Byrnes‚Äô case, his encounter with Private Johnson on July 19, 2005, was the triggering event that unraveled his 36-year military career. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, in consultation with President Bush, fired Byrnes on August 8, 2005, just three weeks after Private Johnson‚Äôs death and a mere three months shy of his scheduled retirement. During the early morning hours of July 19th, Private Johnson inadvertently encountered General Byrnes engaging in the very romance he had been ordered to stop. She was alone at the time because the Army never assigned Private Johnson a ‚Äúbattle buddy‚Äù to accompany her around the base. Private Johnson‚Äôs discovery of Byrnes‚Äô continued adultery left him startled, afraid, and desperate. Byrnes snapped and became violent toward Private Johnson, who did not fight back because she was as shocked as he was and because Byrnes was her TRADOC commander. During his assault on Private Johnson, Byrnes knocked some of her teeth backwards, broke her nose, fractured her neck, and inflicted other serious injuries on her body. Private Johnson was then dragged into a contractor‚Äôs tent where Byrnes staged the crime scene to make it look like Private Johnson had committed suicide. An M16 rifle bearing Serial Number 7095028 was carefully arranged near her body. No M16 bullet was ever located because this weapon was never fired inside the tent. Instead, Byrnes fired one shot from his 9 MM pistol into the top left side of Private Johnson‚Äôs head, execution-style. Byrnes then lit a fire in the tent before leaving the scene. Private Johnson‚Äôs fingerprints were not on the M16 found at the scene. There was no gunpowder residue on her hands. Inexplicably, the military did not test the M16 for traces of Private Johnson‚Äôs DNA. This M16 was not the one assigned to Private Johnson. Her M16 bore Serial Number 7097069 and was the only M16 ever issued to Private Johnson. It was virtually impossible for Private Johnson, with a fractured neck and standing only 5‚Äô1‚Äù, to have had enough mobility left in her battered body to commit suicide by sticking a 40-inch M16 rifle into her mouth and pulling the trigger. Furthermore, the top and back areas of Private Johnson‚Äôs head were still intact after she was shot. Yet, the military stands by its discredited ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù theory. The military tightly controlled access to the investigative files in this case and stonewalled the release of these files to the Johnson family. What is more, the military thought the truth surrounding Private Johnson‚Äôs murder would be buried with her body. In a rare disciplinary act against a four-star general, the Army announced on August 9, 2005, that it had relieved General Byrnes of his command for unspecified \\"personal conduct.\\" Pentagon sources leaked off-the-record information to the media that Byrnes was fired for disobeying General Schoomaker‚Äôs order to stop his extramarital affair. On August 10, 2005, Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington published a story that focused on Secretary Rumfeld‚Äôs firing of General Byrnes. Huffington wrote: ‚Äú [T]he Byrnes firing is stunning‚Ä¶. In modern times, no four-star general has ever been relieved of duty for disciplinary reasons; prior to this incident Byrnes had a spotless military record; he has been separated from his wife since May 2004; the allegations do not involve anyone under his command or connected to the DoD; and he was already set to retire in November‚Ä¶. Something doesn‚Äôt add up. Would the Army really can a four-star General with 36 years of service, three months shy of his retirement, because he screwed someone other than his wife‚Ä¶ in the middle of a war? ‚Ä¶. [T]here has to be more ‚Äì much more‚Äîto this story than is being told.\\" Arianna Huffington was right. There was far more to General Byrnes‚Äô firing than what the military disclosed to the public. The Pentagon knew that Byrnes had murdered Private Johnson. Instead of court-martialing Byrnes for disobeying Schoomaker‚Äôs lawful order and for the murder of Private Johnson, President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld opted to kick Byrnes out of the Army three months early. The cover-up of Private Johnson‚Äôs murder was successful for more than a decade because she was a young female Army private - a ‚Äúnobody‚Äù in the world of Bush, Rumsfeld, and the Pentagon‚Äôs top brass. In contrast, Kevin Byrnes was a powerful four- star general who counted Bush, Rumsfeld and fellow military generals like David Petraeus among his circle of influential Washington friends. Byrnes now lives a comfortable life in Huntsville, Alabama, where he works as a top executive for Raytheon, a major defense contractor. Even though Byrnes was booted out of the military, the Pentagon afforded him the courtesy of publicly spinning his firing in a way that focused only on his extramarital affair. In doing so, the Pentagon, with the blessing of Bush and Rumsfeld, effectively awarded Byrnes an undisclosed de facto pardon for the murder of Private Johnson. Now, we know what really happened to Private Johnson, why it happened, and who is responsible for her murder. She met her death on a military base in Balad, Iraq, some 6,620 miles from her hometown of Florissant, Missouri. Private Johnson was a great soldier. She volunteered to put her life on the line in Iraq to protect America from its foreign enemies. This is the highest form of loyalty any soldier can give to his/her country. Private Johnson did not deserve to die this way - alone, unprotected, and betrayed by her country. Justice for Private Johnson has been delayed for more than ten years, but it can no longer be denied. From her grave, she spoke the truth. In the end, the truth has prevailed. A four-star general who was relieved of command this week said Wednesday through his lawyer that the Army took the action after an investigation into accusations that he was involved in a consensual relationship with a female civilian. The lawyer, Lt. Col. David H. Robertson, said the case involves an adult relationship with a woman who is not in the military, nor is a civilian employee of the military or the federal government. The general, Kevin P. Byrnes, was relieved... by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, just a few months before General Byrnes was scheduled to retire as head of the Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).\\" References External links https://www.donaldwatkins.com/post/the-murder-of-pfc-lavena-johnson-part-3 *Outside the Beltway Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:United States Army generals Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Military personnel from New York City Category:Webster University alumni Category:Park University alumni ","title":"Kevin P.

Ironwood Ridge is one of three high schools in the Amphitheater Public School District and serves grades 9-12. The school mascot is the nighthawk, and the school colors are navy blue and silver. Ironwood Ridge opened in 2001 and has a student enrollment of 1,942. The school's name originates from the abundance of desert ironwood trees in the area (the campus is also near Ironwood Forest National Monument) and the school's location in the rugged foothills of the Tortolita Mountains. In 2007, Newsweek magazine rated Ironwood Ridge in the top 5% of public schools in the US, one of 12 Arizona schools included on the list.\\"Area high schools snag top honors\\" (broken link) The school's primary and district rival is Canyon del Oro High School, also located in Oro Valley. The school's other rivals are Marana's Mountain View High School and Cienega High School, located southeast of Tucson in Vail. History =Population growth in Tucson's northwest suburbs= The history of Ironwood Ridge includes substantial controversy and a federal court decision from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2000 from Republican John Pae. The Amphi School District's first high school (Amphitheater) was built in 1939, followed by Canyon del Oro High School in 1962. The school board began searching for a third high school site in the late 1970s when it became apparent that significant development would occur on the northwest side of Tucson. Tentative deals were negotiated with developers, but by the late 1980s, all of the deals were unsuccessful, and the school district lacked a viable site for a future high school. By 1993, overcrowding existed at a growing number of district schools, at all grade levels, in part due to the growth on the northwest side. At the time, the most critical crowding was in the elementary school grade levels. The school board noted that the overcrowding problem would eventually affect the district's high schools by the late 1990s. In 1993, the school board systematically searched for school sites on the Northwest Side where the majority of growth in the district was occurring. By early 1994, potential sites were narrowed down, and in April 1994, the school board purchased two sites adjacent to one another on the southeast corner of West Naranja Drive and North Shannon Road, at that time west of Oro Valley. =The impact of the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl= By 1994, the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl had been identified as a \\"species of special concern\\" by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). A FWS report on the owl was published in 1994 with a map depicting the areas believed to be prime potential habitats for the owl. The two school sites were not identified as being located in those areas. The school district planned to break ground in October 1997, with the high school opening by August 1999. In spring 1997, all the plans and blueprints for the school were completed, and the district had obtained all the required permits for construction, with the exception of one. The school site had a significant wash running through it, and the Army Corps of Engineers contended that building on such a wash constituted modifying a navigable waterway and required a 404 permit. As the school district applied for the permit, the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl was listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by the FWS in 1997. Within an area in Arizona designated by the FWS as critical habitat of the pygmy owl included the owned by the school district. were earmarked for construction of the high school, with the remaining to remain undeveloped. At the request of the school board, the Arizona Game and Fish Department conducted six surveys on the site and did not find ferruginous pygmy owls on the property or on the adjacent land where the owls last were sighted in early 1996. The school board then began a process with the FWS to mitigate disturbance of the potential owl habitat on the site. Negotiations with the FWS were ultimately unsuccessful, and the school district proceeded with developing the school site. Federal lawsuit When the school district began construction operations on the parcel, Defenders of Wildlife (Defenders), an environmental group, brought an action for injunctive relief under Section 9 of the ESA (applicable to private parties) in the US District Court of Arizona, alleging that the proposed school construction was likely to harm or harass pygmy owls that used or inhabited the site. Defenders obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the construction. The Arizona District Court found that no pygmy owl had been detected anywhere within the school site, and that the evidence was insufficient to show that a pygmy owl had used any portion of the parcel. The court also concluded that while the evidence supported an inference that a pygmy owl used the parcel, the allegation that the construction would harm the owl lacked such support, and was weakened by inconsistent facts. As to harassment of the pygmy owl, the court determined that the evidence did not show that the bird's behavioral patterns would be adversely affected by construction of the school. In the court's view, only speculation supporting the assertion that human activity associated with the school would harass the owl. Defenders of Wildlife appealed the District Court decision, and the case proceeded to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court held that the school district could not be prevented from building a school on the site. The court asserted that critical habitat designation played no role in the case. At the time of appeal, FWS had not yet made a critical habitat designation for the pygmy owl. The Ninth Circuit found that the insufficiency of Defenders' evidence was the main issue, and any critical habitat designation would not have altered the outcome of the case. =Establishment of IRHS= The school district finally began construction of the high school following the decision in early 2000, and Ironwood Ridge opened for students in fall 2001, eliminating the overcrowding issue at Canyon del Oro High School. Feeder schools Ironwood Ridge is fed by Richard B. Wilson K-8 School and Coronado K-8 School. Rivals Ironwood's major rivals include the nearby Canyon del Oro High School and Cienega High School from Vail.

Goosetown is the prequel to Gum-Dipped: A Daughter Remembers Rubber Town, her book about the decades when Akron was the Rubber Capital of the World. In it Dyer provides a loving but complicated portrait of her father and a view of the relationships among Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, its employees, and the city of Akron, Ohio. An earlier memoir, In a Tangled Wood: An Alzheimer's Journey, was published by Southern Methodist University Press in 1996, shortly after the death of Annabelle Coyne, the author's mother. Dyer has also edited two collections of essays, Bloodroot: Reflections on Place by Appalachian Women Writers and From Curlers to Chainsaws: Women and Their Machines. Her first book, The Awakening: A Novel of Beginnings, was a scholarly study of Kate Chopin, a turn-of-the-century American writer. Joyce Dyer is Professor Emerita of English at Hiram College, where she directed the Lindsay-Crane Center for Writing and Literature. Recipient of the 1998 Appalachian Book of the Year Award, the 2009 David B. Saunders Award in Creative Nonfiction, the 2016 Independent Book Publisher Gold Medal Award for anthology, and Ohio Arts Council Individual Excellence Awards, Dyer has spent the last eight years at work on a book about abolitionist John Brown, who grew up in Hudson, Ohio, the town where the author lives. A mix of memoir, biography, American history, and travel writing, Pursuing John Brown: On the Trail of a Radical Abolitionist will be published by the University of Akron Press in November of 2020. Dyer's biography is included in Contemporary Authors, volume 146, and in the New Revision Series, volume 91. Background Joyce Coyne (Dyer) was born in Akron, Ohio, during the summer of 1947. Her father, Thomas William (T.W.) Coyne, was a supervisor for the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and his experiences inspired Dyer to write Gum-Dipped: A Daughter Remembers Rubber Town. Dyer's mother was a clerk for the Board of Education in Akron. Dyer graduated with a B.A. in English from Wittenberg University and a Ph.D. in English from Kent State University. She taught at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois, Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, and Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio, where she held the John S. Kenyon Chair in English. In addition to publishing six books, she is the author of numerous essays that have appeared in periodicals such as North American Review, Writer's Chronicle, and the New York Times, as well as many anthologies. She has run workshops throughout the Appalachian South and Midwest and served on staff at such programs as 826michigan Writers Conference in Ann Arbor, The Twenty: A Kentucky Writers Advance, the Antioch Writers' Workshop in Yellow Springs, Ohio, the Appalachian Writers Workshop in Hindman, Kentucky, the Wright State University Institute on Writing and Teaching in Dayton, Ohio, and the Highland Summer Conference in Radford, Virginia. A few years ago she served as visiting writer in creative nonfiction for the Northeast Ohio Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (NEOMFA).

The fighting was between residents of the Bogside area (organised under the Derry Citizens' Defence Association), and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) along with local unionists. The rioting erupted at the end of an Apprentice Boys parade which was passing along the city walls, past the Catholic Bogside. Fierce rioting broke out between local unionists and the police on one side and Catholics on the other. Rioting between police and Bogside residents continued for three days. The police were unable to enter the area and eventually the British Army was deployed to restore order. The riot, which sparked widespread violence elsewhere in Northern Ireland, is commonly seen as one of the first major confrontations in the conflict known as the Troubles. Background Tensions had been building in Derry for over a year before the Battle of the Bogside. In part, this was due to long-standing grievances held by much of the city's population. The city had a majority Catholic and nationalist population. In 1961, for example, the population was 53,744, of which 36,049 was Catholic and 17,695 Protestant. However, because of gerrymandering after the partition of Ireland, it had been ruled by the Ulster Unionist Party since 1925. =Nationalist grievances= Unionists maintained political control of Derry by two means. Firstly, electoral wards were gerrymandered so as to give unionists a majority of elected representatives in the city. The Londonderry County Borough, which covered the city, had been won by nationalists in 1921. It was recovered by unionists, however, following re-drawing of electoral boundaries by the unionist government in the Northern Ireland Parliament. Secondly, only owners or tenants of a dwelling and their spouses were allowed to vote in local elections. Nationalists argued that these practices were retained by unionists after their abolition in Great Britain in 1945 in order to reduce the anti-unionist vote. Figures show that, in Derry city, nationalists comprised 61.6% of parliamentary electors, but only 54.7% of local government electors.Gallagher, Frank (1957), The Indivisible Island: the Story of the Partition of Ireland, p227-8, London: Gollancz. There was also widespread discrimination in employment. As a result, although Catholics made up 60% of Derry's population in 1961,Hewitt, Christopher (1981), 'Catholic grievances, Catholic nationalism and violence in Northern Ireland during the civil rights period: a reconsideration', British Journal of Sociology, Vol. 32, No. 3, p366 due to the division of electoral wards, unionists had a majority of 12 seats to 8 on the city council. When there arose the possibility of nationalists gaining one of the wards, the boundaries were redrawn to maintain unionist control.Buckland, Patrick (1979), The Factory of Grievances: Devolved Government in Northern Ireland, 1921-1939, p243-6, Dublin: Gill & Macmillan. Control of the city council gave unionists control over the allocation of public housing, which they allocated in such a way as to keep the Catholic population in a limited number of wards. This policy had the additional effect of creating a housing shortage for Catholics. Another grievance, highlighted by the Cameron Commission (In March 1969, the O'Neill ministry appointed John Cameron chairman of a commission into the causes of \\"the violence and civil disturbance in Northern Ireland on and since 5 October 1968\\") into the riots of 1969, was the issue of perceived regional bias; where Northern Ireland government decisions favoured the mainly Ulster Protestant east of Northern Ireland rather than the mainly Catholic west.Disturbances in Northern Ireland: Report of the Commission appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland, paragraph 132, Belfast: HMSO, Cmd 532. Examples of such controversial decisions affecting Derry were the decision to close the anti- submarine training school in 1965, adding 600 to an unemployment figure already approaching 20%; the decision to site Northern Ireland's new town at Craigavon and the siting of Northern Ireland's second university in the mainly unionist town of Coleraine rather than Derry, which had four times the population and was Northern Ireland's second biggest city.Darby, John (1976), Conflict in Northern Ireland: the Development of a Polarised Community, p67, Dublin: Gill & Macmillan =Activism= In March 1968, a few activists in the city founded the Derry Housing Action Committee, with the intention of forcing the government of Northern Ireland to change its housing policies. The group's founders were mostly local members of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, such as Eamonn McCann, and members of the James Connolly Republican Club (the Northern manifestation of Sinn F√©in, which was banned in Northern Ireland). The Housing Action Committee took direct action, such as blocking roads and attending local council meetings uninvited, in order to force them to house Catholic families who had been on the council housing waiting list for a long time. By the middle of 1968, this group had linked up with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and were agitating for a broader programme of reform within Northern Ireland.Eamonn McCann, War and an Irish Town, p83-94 On 5 October 1968, these activists organised a march through the centre of Derry. However, the demonstration was banned. When the marchers, including Members of Parliament Eddie McAteer and Ivan Cooper, defied this ban they were batoned by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The actions of the police were televised and caused widespread anger across Ireland, particularly among northern nationalists. The following day, 4,000 people demonstrated in solidarity with the marchers in Guildhall Square in the centre of Derry. This march passed off peacefully, as did another demonstration attended by up to 15,000 people on 16 November. However, these incidents proved to be the start of an escalating pattern of civil unrest, that culminated in the events of August 1969.Eamonn McCann, War and an Irish Town, p97-105 =January to July 1969= Free Derry Corner in the Bogside; the slogan \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\" was first painted in January 1969 by John Casey. In January 1969, a march by the radical nationalist group People's Democracy from Belfast to Derry was attacked by off-duty Ulster Special Constabulary members and other Ulster loyalists during the Burntollet bridge incident, five miles outside Derry. The regular police refused to protect the marchers. When the marchers (many of whom were injured) arrived in Derry on 5 January, fighting broke out between their supporters and the police. That night, police officers broke into homes in the Catholic Bogside area and assaulted several residents. An inquiry led by Lord Cameron concluded that, \\"a number of policemen were guilty of misconduct, which involved assault and battery, malicious damage to property...and the use of provocative sectarian and political slogans\\".Eamonn McCann, War and an Irish Town, page 108 After this point, barricades were set up in the Bogside and vigilante patrols organised to keep the police out. It was at this point that the famous mural with the slogan \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\" was painted on the corner of Columbs Street by a local activist named John Casey. On 19 April there were clashes between NICRA marchers, loyalists and the police in the Bogside area. Police officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), a local Catholic who was not involved in the riot, and severely beat him with batons. His teenage daughters were also beaten in the attack. Devenny died of his injuries on 17 July and he is sometimes referred to as the first victim of the Troubles. Others consider John Patrick Scullion, who was killed 11 June 1966 by the Ulster Volunteer Force, to have been the first victim of the conflict.Loyalists, pp. 41-44. On 12 July (\\"The Twelfth\\") there was further rioting in Derry, in nearby Dungiven, and in Belfast. The violence arose out of the yearly Orange Order marches commemorating the Battle of the Boyne. During the clashes in Dungiven, Catholic civilian Francis McCloskey (67) was beaten with batons by police officers and died of his injuries the following day. Following these riots, Irish republicans in Derry set up the Derry Citizens Defence Association, with the intention of preparing for future disturbances. The members of the DCDA were initially Republican Club (and possibly IRA) activists, but they were joined by many other left-wing activists and local people. This group stated their aim as firstly to keep the peace, but if this failed, to organise the defence of the Bogside. To this end, they stockpiled materials for barricades and missiles, ahead of the Apprentice Boys of Derry march on 12 August, the Relief of Derry parade. Apprentice Boys march The Bogside in 2004, looking down from the city walls. The area has been greatly redeveloped since 1969, with the demolition of much of the old slum housing and the Rossville Street flats. The annual Apprentice Boys parade on 12 August commemorates the relief of the Siege of Derry on 1 August O. S., a Protestant victory. The march was considered highly provocative by many Catholics. Derry activist Eamonn McCann wrote that the march \\"was regarded as a calculated insult to the Derry Catholics\\".McCann, War and an Irish Town p114 Although the march did not pass through the Bogside, it passed near to it at the junction of Waterloo Place and William Street. It was here that trouble broke out. Initially, some loyalists had thrown pennies from the top of the walls at Catholics in the Bogside below, in return marbles were fired by slingshot. As the parade passed the perimeter of the Bogside, Catholics hurled stones and nails, resulting in an intense confrontation. The police, who had suffered a barrage of missiles, then moved in. Whilst the police fought with the rioters at William Street, officers at the Rossville Street barricade encouraged civilian Protestants slingshotting stones across the barricade at the Catholics. The police then tried to alleviate the pressure they were under by dismantling the barricade. The result of this was the creation of a gap allowing Protestant civilians through, convincing the Catholic residents that their homes were going to be attacked. The police were unable to get into the Bogside. Nationalists lobbed petrol bombs from the top of the Rossville Flats, halting the police advance, with 43 of the 59 officers who made the initial incursion injured.Mallie, Bishop p99 As this happened the people of Derry, numbering in their hundreds, continued to fight each other, with petrol bombs and stones thrown between loyalists and nationalists. The battle The actions of the Bogside residents were co-ordinated to some extent. The Derry Citizens Defence Association set up a headquarters in the house of Paddy Doherty in Westland Street and tried to supervise the making of petrol bombs and the positioning of barricades. They also set up \\"Radio Free Derry.\\" Many local people, however, joined in the rioting on their own initiative and impromptu leaders also emerged, such as Bernadette Devlin, Eamonn McCann and others. Local youths climbed onto the roof of the High Flats on Rossville Street, from where they bombarded the police below with missiles. When the advantage that this position possessed was realised, the youths were kept supplied with stones and petrol bombs. The police were in many respects badly prepared for the riot. Their riot shields were too small and did not protect their whole bodies. In addition, their uniforms were not flame resistant and a number were badly burned by petrol bombs. They possessed armoured cars and guns, but were not permitted to use them. Moreover, there was no system in place to relieve officers, with the result that the same policemen had to serve in the rioting for three days without rest. The police responded to this situation by flooding the area with CS gas, which caused a range of respiratory injuries among local people. A total of 1,091 canisters, each containing 12.5g of CS; and 14 canisters containing 50g of CS, were released in the densely populated residential area. (extracts available online) After two days of almost continuous rioting, during which police were drafted in from all over Northern Ireland, the police were exhausted, and were snatching sleep in doorways whenever the opportunity allowed. On 13 August, Jack Lynch, Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, made a televised speech about the events in Derry, in which he said that he \\"could not stand by and watch innocent people injured and perhaps worse.\\" He promised to send the Irish Army to the border and to set up field hospitals for those injured in the fighting. Lynch's words were widely interpreted in the Bogside as promising that Irish troops were about to be sent to their aid. Unionists were appalled at this prospect, which they saw as a threatened invasion of Northern Ireland. Although the Irish Army was sent to the border, they restricted their activities to providing medical care for the injured. By 14 August, the rioting in the Bogside had reached a critical point. Almost the entire community there had been mobilised by this point, many galvanised by false rumours that St Eugene's Cathedral had been attacked by the police. The police were also beginning to use firearms. Two rioters were shot and injured in Great James Street. The B-Specials, a reserve quasi-military, mostly Protestant police force with no training in crowd control, were called up and sent to Derry, provoking fears of a massacre on the part of the Bogsiders. On the afternoon of the 14th, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, James Chichester-Clark, took the unprecedented step of requesting the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson for troops to be sent to Derry. Soon afterwards a company of the 1st Battalion, Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire (who had been on standby at HMS Sea Eagle) relieved the police, with orders to separate the police and the Bogsiders, but not to attempt to breach the barricades and enter the Bogside itself. This marked the first direct intervention of the London government in Ireland since partition. The British troops were at first welcomed by the Bogside residents as a neutral force compared to the police and especially the B-Specials. Only a handful of radicals in Bogside, notably Bernadette Devlin, opposed the deployment of British troops. This good relationship did not last long however, as the Troubles escalated. Over 1,000 people were injured in the rioting in Derry, but no one was killed. A total of 691 policemen were deployed in Derry during the riot, of whom only 255 were still in action at 12:30 on the 15th. Manpower then fluctuated for the rest of the afternoon: the numbers recorded are 318, 304, 374, 333, 285 and finally 327 at 5.30 pm. While some of the fluctuation in numbers can be put down to exhaustion rather than injury, these figures indicate that the police suffered at least 350 serious injuries. How many Bogsiders were injured is unclear, as many injuries were never reported. Rioting elsewhere A call by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association for people to stretch police resources to aid the Bogsiders led to rioting in Belfast and elsewhere, which left seven Catholics and two Protestants dead. That same night (the 14th) a loyalist mob burned all of the Catholic homes on Bombay Street, Belfast. Over 1,800 people (mostly Catholics) were expelled from their homes in Belfast. Taken together with events in Derry, this period of rioting is widely seen as the point in which the Troubles escalated from a situation of civil unrest to one of a three-way armed conflict between nationalists, state forces and unionists.

Though flipping can apply to any asset, the term is most often applied to real estate and initial public offerings (IPOs). The term \\"house flipping\\" is used by real estate investors to describe the process of buying, rehabbing, and selling properties for profit. In 2017, 207,088 houses or condos were flipped in the U.S., which is an 11 year high. In the United Kingdom, \\"flipping\\" is used to describe a technique whereby Members of Parliament were found to be switching their second home between several houses, which had the effect of allowing them to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances. Types =Wholesaling and assigning a contract= Wholesalers make a profit by signing a contract to purchase a property from a seller and then entering into an agreement with a third party to resell the same property at a higher price for a profit. All rights to the original purchase contract are assigned to the new buyer and the new buyer pays an \\"assignment fee\\" to the wholesaler in order to gain all rights to purchase the property at the original purchase price. The original purchase contract usually has an \\"inspection period\\" which allows the original buyer to back out of the contract and not close on it if they do not find a buyer to assign their contract to. Many wholesalers have no intention of actually purchasing the property and simply use wholesaling as a tool to locate properties for other investors. The general process of wholesaling real estate is as follows: # Establish a wholesaling business entity. It is possible to be a wholesaler without a legal business entity (i.e. as an individual or working under a DBA). However, the majority of real estate wholesalers form a limited liability corporation (LLC) or C- or S-corporation for tax and liability protection purposes. # Find undervalued properties to wholesale. This can be done using online advertising, direct mail, personal networking and canvassing neighborhoods. Wholesalers often work together to source properties, as well. # Sign a Wholesale Purchase Agreement with the property owner. This is an exclusive agreement for a set period of time (e.g. 30 days) to find a buyer who will purchase the property at or above a specified price. The Wholesale Purchase Agreement is recorded at the County Recorder's office. This ensures the property seller cannot legally sell the property during the period when the wholesaler has the exclusive right to obtain a buyer. # Assign the Wholesale Purchase Agreement to a buyer or another wholesaler for a fee. The buyer or new wholesaler pays the original wholesaler a negotiated fee to purchase the right to buy the property from the seller at or above the stated price in the Wholesale Purchase Agreement. This right is transferred to the buyer or new wholesaler via an Assignment Agreement, which is typically embedded in the Wholesale Purchase Agreement. # The Assignment Agreement is recorded at the County Recorder's office. This ensures the original wholesaler cannot double-assign the Wholesale Purchase Agreement after assigning it to the buyer or another wholesaler. In many cases, if another buyer is not found before the end of the inspection period, the wholesaler cancels the original purchase contract (through its cancellation clause) and gets back the deposit. Wholesaling requires little or no money to be secured in escrow, and in most cases the wholesaler never intends to actually purchase the property. The practice of wholesaling is often advertised as \\"No Money Down and No Risk\\" by many real estate coaching companies and infomercials since the actual deposit can be as little as $10 and often even the deposit can be returned if the wholesaler cancels the contract before the end of the inspection period. Some people are of the opinion that wholesaling is fraudulent misrepresentation since the wholesaler does not actually intend to close on the property themselves. However, in the United States wholesaling is perfectly legal and most real estate contracts allow the buyer an inspection period and any amount of deposit that buyer and seller agree to. Wholesaling in property is no different from wholesaling in any other industry. In a successful transaction the seller is often unaware that original buyer is not purchasing the property. In some cases, wholesalers actually purchase the property for cash and then resell the property to their end buyer in a second closing. This practice is considered more costly since the buyer is paying closing costs to purchase the property and to resell the property. However many people consider double closing to be more ethical. In cases where there are substantial profits from reselling it often makes sense for the wholesaler to pay for two closing costs (double closing) to avoid requesting a large assignment fee from their buyer. =Wholesaling a property multiple times = It is not uncommon for a property to be assigned multiple times and for a few wholesalers to make money in a transaction from the seller to the end buyer. The original wholesaler enters into a contract to purchase a property and then assigns or sells their rights to that contract to another investor. That investor then assigns their rights to said contract to a third investor and so forth. In many cases wholesalers work together ensuring that all parties get paid on a transaction. This practice is often frowned upon in the real estate community since it seems unethical or illegal. In practice there is nothing illegal about wholesaling or assigning rights to a purchase contract even if it is multiple times. It is important to understand that the reason there is an opportunity to wholesale is because the original seller is selling the property for substantially less than market value. This usually occurs when either the property or the seller is in distress. Examples of distress could be a property damaged by fire, flood, hurricane or a homeowner that is facing foreclosure and is about to lose their home and is selling it for substantially less than fair market value. The practice of buying real estate at substantially below market value is called Distressed Real Estate Investing or Wholesale Real Estate Investing hence the term \\"wholesaler\\". =Real estate flipping= Profits from flipping real estate come from either buying low and selling high (often in a rapidly rising market), or buying a house that needs repair and fixing it up before reselling it for a profit (\\"fix and flip\\"). Under the \\"fix and flip\\" scenario, an investor or flipper will purchase a property at a discount price. The discount may be because of: *the property's condition (e.g., the house needs major renovations and/or repairs which the owner either does not want, or cannot afford, to do), or *the owner(s) needing to sell a property quickly (e.g., relocation, divorce, pending foreclosure). The investor will then perform necessary renovations and repairs, and attempt to make a profit by selling the house quickly at a higher price. The \\"fix and flip\\" scenario is profitable to investors because the average homebuyer lacks the time and funds to repairs and renovations, so they look for a property that is ready to move into. Also, most traditional mortgage lenders require the home to be habitable with no significant repairs. =Second home flipping= In the UK, Members of Parliament with constituencies outside of London are given an allowance to maintain an extra home in London allowing them to live closer to the Houses of Parliament during the working week. Certain costs for this second home can be claimed and are thus partly funded by the taxpayer. MPs can nominate any of their other properties as the second home, which has tax advantages for not being their primary residence and can lead to additional allowances. \\"Flipping\\" occurs when the nominated second and primary dwellings are frequently changed, particularly during the parliamentary recess. The dwelling may in fact be rented out for profit but still receive the allowances. In some circumstances, MPs can simultaneously declare one home to be both their primary residence (for tax purposes) and their second residence (for expenses purposes). The practice ended on 15 May 2009 following publication of the Disclosure of expenses of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament after a public scandal. =Car flipping= Similar to real estate flipping, car flipping is the process of buying automobiles at a low price and selling such vehicle at a higher price. A car flipper will identify reasonably priced vehicles that can be sold at a higher price after reconditioning and marketing to a larger market. In the United States, car flipping can be a hobby for car enthusiasts, or a primary business in the form of state licensed car dealers. Flipping cars is legal if the vehicles are titled in the person's name or processed through a state licensed dealership. Many states have laws and regulation limiting the number of vehicles a person can flip within each year unless they are a dealer or associate. This number varies from state to state, from 2 to 10. Car flipping has a larger market and requires less investment than flipping real estate.Car Flipping =Product flipping= Outside of real estate and cars, all consumer products can be flipped. Product flipping entails buying products at a low price and selling it at a higher price for profit. Products can be new or used items. Many times, product flippers buy products at dollar stores, thrift stores, garage sales and estate auctions and resell them at a higher price on online marketplaces or locally. Compared to real estate flipping and car flipping, product flipping requires much lower capital to get started and thus sellers take on much less risk. Due to lower profit margins, product flippers often employ various tricks that other kinds of flippers do not have to worry about. These tricks include utilizing coupons and cash back rebates as well as finding creative ways of saving on shipping. Common products that are flipped for profit are clothes, cell phones, books, and coins. Other less common products that are flipped are digital in nature such as Bitcoin, websites and gaming accounts. Effects =Bubbles= A spate of flipping often creates an economic bubble which then bursts, such as during the Florida land boom of the 1920s.Crashes: The Florida Real Estate Craze In the 2000s, relaxed federal borrowing standards (including subprime lending that allowed a borrower to purchase a home with little or no money down) may have led directly to a boom in demand for houses. Because it was easy to borrow, many investors bought homes as property speculation with no intent to live in them. Since the demand outstripped the supply, prices rose, giving a short-term profit. This resulted in an inflationary spiral until the bubble burst in 2008 and borrowing standards became stricter, leaving the housing market to bottom out. Flipping was so popular in the United States that many DIY television programs like A&E; Network's Flip This House detailed the process. Flipping becomes less desirable when interest rates are high and so demand is lower. The resulting lack of sales, and major price cuts, results in a flood of properties on the market at one time, resulting in an excess of supply to demand. =Rejuvenation and gentrification= \\"Rational\\" flipping can encourage a rejuvenation and restoration of a previously decrepit neighborhood, a process known as gentrification, which increases property values but can cause a population shift. Under the broken windows theory, an unkempt house or area attracts a criminal element, which drives out those making a responsible living, which allows for more criminal element, and so on in a spiral. Restoration creates jobs, particularly in construction, and generates more sales (and sales taxes) for local vendors and suppliers. The renovated homes attract new populations and businesses to a region, encouraging more economic development; their higher assessed values brings more property tax revenue to local governments, allowing for more improvements and more policing. When flipping occurs frequently in a community, the total cost of ownership can rise substantially, eventually forcing current residents to relocate, specifically poorer young and old people. On a small scale, flippers can cause distress and disturbance to their immediate neighbors by performing lengthy renovations. Flippers often have no interest in neighborhood integration, which may cause tension with long-term residents. During the real estate bubble of the 2000s, flipping and gentrification were both linked to the mass migration of people to California, where high real estate prices and ample jobs attracted wealth seekers. In response, many native Californians were forced to migrate to the less expensive areas of states such as Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Oregon and Washington. This migration of Californians caused further gentrification in the areas that they had moved to in large numbers. Areas such as Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas Valley became much more expensive, although property prices dropped significantly after 2006. In 2020 the emphasis on house flipping shifted to the Midwest, where Greater Cleveland became one of the most lucrative places in the country to own rentals and flip homes. A typical project in the area, as in other areas in the Great Lakes region, pays back twice the cost of the purchased structure. Investors from California have been steered by advisors from the Sunbelt to northeastern Ohio. In 2019 the median flip home was bought for $60,000 and sold for $124,000. 100% margins were also endemic to Akron, OH; Pittsburgh; and South Bend, IN. =Property values= After a renovation, the house itself will be in better condition and last longer, and can be sold at a higher price, thus increasing its property tax assessed value, plus increased sales for goods and services related to property improvement and the related increase in sales taxes. Neighbors can also benefit by having more attractive homes in the neighborhood, thereby increasing the value of their own homes. Regulations In 2006, the Department of Housing and Urban Development created regulations regarding predatory flipping within Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single-family mortgage insurance. The time requirement for owning a property was greater than 90 days between purchase and sale dates to qualify for FHA-insured mortgage financing.Prohibition of Property Flipping in HUD's Single Family Mortgage Insurance Programs; Additional Exceptions to Time Restriction on Sales  Federal Register Environmental Documents  USEPA This requirement was greatly relaxed in January 2010, and the 90-day holding period was all but eliminated.HUD Press Release, January 15 2010. Illegal activity Flipping can sometimes also be a criminal scheme. Illegal property flipping is a fraud whereby recently acquired property is resold for a considerable profit with an artificially inflated value. The property is quickly resold after making few, or only cosmetic, improvements. Illegal property flipping often involves collusion between a real estate appraiser, a mortgage originator and a closing agent. The cooperation of a real estate appraiser is necessary to get a false, artificially inflated, appraisal report. The buyer may or may not be aware of the situation. This type of fraud is one of the most costly for lenders. Renovating distressed or abandoned properties was sometimes linked to malicious and unscrupulous acts in the post housing bubble era. As a result, \\"flipping\\" was frequently used both as a descriptive term for schemes involving market manipulation or other illegal conduct and as a derogatory term for legal real estate investing strategies that are perceived by some to be unethical or socially destructive. The term has a more positive connotation these days with the popularity of television shows like Flip or Flop and Flip That House. In the United States, the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) governs real estate appraisal and Fannie Mae, oversees the secondary residential mortgage loan market. Both have practices to detect illegal flipping schemes.  In television  In July 2012, business network CNBC green-lit several pilots for reality television series focusing on house flipping.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 5 August 2005. Jack was a police officer. The Holden family ‚Äî Jack, his father Tony and his brother Lucas arrived in Summer Bay in 2005. In November 2008, the season finale, Jack was accidentally shot in the chest at a construction site by fellow police officer, Angelo Rosetta. In the first episode of the 2009 season, it was revealed that Jack had died after paramedics failed to revive him at the scene. Paul O'Brien decided to leave the series in 2008 and Jack made his last appearance in the season finale for 2008. Character development Most of Jack's storylines were central to his on-off relationship with Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon). Viewers saw the couple go through marriage, divorce, a second marriage and Martha being widowed. Martha and Jack's first marriage is cut short because they argue to much, Martha leaves Jack. They start to lead separate lives, but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion, Martha who is feeling low at this point kisses him, Jack's girlfriend Sam Tolhurst (Jessica Chapnik) sees this. Of the situation during an interview with Yahoo, O'Brien stated: \\"I think Jack felt like \\"Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone, but deep down he still wants Martha.\\" O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst with he was in a relationship with Sam. Both O'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a bad time for Jack, as his life was spiraling out of control, he needed her, but she left him when he needed her the most. They later become friends in an unlikely turn of events, O'Brien believed it hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving towards her. Whilst the characters were separated on-screen, they had gained a fan base on the Internet that believed Jack should be with Martha and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together and perfect for each other. Whilst interviewed she said: \\"I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a sucker for romance so, I want want them to be together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things getting in the way of them getting back together all the time.\\" Gordon also hoped for a happy ever after type ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial commenting: \\"If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset.\\" Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are \\"the ultimate couple\\". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. On-screen Jack and Martha later reconcile, he helps her through her hard times. Gordon believed that their relationship was at its strongest peak whilst she had breast cancer. During an interview with What's on TV Gordon spoke of the state of their relationship stating: \\"Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy.\\" Storylines Jack arrives with his father, Tony and brother, Lucas in Summer Bay. It is quickly revealed Jack is responsible for the death of a teenage girl in a shootout. The girl's father, Harry Chambers (Rodney Dobsen) arrives in town holding Jack responsible for his daughter's death. Following all the furore, A town meeting is held and it is revealed Jack had returned fire in self-defence and the locals believe him. Martha MacKenzie is often frosty towards Jack but he refuses to give up on her. They begins various contest against each other including a pool competition with a nudie run stipulation and a drinking contest. These games backfire when Martha exploits Jack's deathly fear of spiders and plants one in his room. Jack discovers it after coming out of the shower and falls and hits his head. He then rushed to hospital and is operated on but suffers temporary hearing loss. Upon finding out Martha is responsible, He is angry with her but later forgives her after she threatens to jump off a cliff after he jokingly suggests so. Jack's colleague Corey Henderson (Adam Saunders) takes an interest in Martha and she reciprocates, leading to Jack's jealousy. When Jack finds that Corey is poisoning Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) he tries to warn Martha but she puts it down to his jealousy. Martha then agrees to move away with Corey to the city. Jack tries to stop them but they have already left. Martha figures out Jack is telling the truth and is rescued just in time. At Noah Smith's christening, Jack and Martha get back together. Jack and Martha begin talking about settling down and being a family and Jack fakes being cold on the marriage idea. However he gets a shock when it looks like Martha is the one having second thoughts and is further surprised when she proposes. Jack and Martha marry at St. James' Church with their friends and family present but the reception is ruined when Eve Jacobsen (Emily Perry) the Summer Bay stalker causes an explosion which kills her, Tracey Thompson (Sarah Enright) and Elaine Armstrong (Julie Hudspeth) and leaves several other including Jack and Martha. Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews) arranges for a group of burn victims to be airlifted to the city for surgery and Martha is among the casualties.

Shane Deeks (Mike Duncan), Sam's ex-husband arrives in Summer Bay and tries to snatch Rory. He is foiled by Jack but Sam and Rory leave. Jack's attentions are back on Martha when she enters a downward spiral after finding out Ash is married with children. He is further shocked when attending Peter Baker's (Nicholas Bishop) stag night to find Martha working as a pole dancer. Jack then battles Cam Reynolds (Ashley Lyons), Martha's boss and boyfriend and tries to frame him for drug dealing but Cam twists the situation by framing Martha. Jack then destroys the evidence when Martha is arrested. Cam torches the club and Jack saves Martha. Following death of Tony's partner, Beth Hunter (Clarissa House), Jack supports Tony and Lucas. Jack is part of a crew that go missing on a boat in a storm and when the others return he is not with them prompting worry. However, Jack never boarded. Martha goes over to house to call off the divorce but finds a newly returned Sam and Rory. George Watson (Paul Barry) frames Jack for a bank robbery and shoots Colin Marshall (Nathan Page), the shooter and frames Jack then shoots Jack. Jack remains comatose for several days and when he awakes he realises it is Martha he loves, not Sam. When Rory overhears Martha suggesting Jack postpone the wedding, Sam gets angry and bans Martha from attending. Jack and Sam marry but when they return from their honeymoon, they discover escaped criminal Johnny Cooper is hiding out. Sam later kills Johnny by hitting him over the head with a baseball bat. When Jack finds out about Sam's drug deals via a letter left by Johnny, he ends the marriage with her and he threatens to call the police. Sam tells him she is pregnant and he gives her 12 hours to leave town. His day is further exacerbated when he sees Martha on a date with Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby). Jack hands in the letter but Sam with one final act of revenge lets the police know about him tampering with the evidence from Martha's previous arrest. Jack leaves the bay for a while but is alarmed to discover Sam's body has been found washed up on the beach, leaving him a prime suspect in the murder. Ross Buckton (David Downer) investigates the case and has a theory that Jack and Martha killed Sam because she was in the way of their relationship. Martha's great aunt Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) submits the theory that Sam committed suicide and made it look like murder, which is revealed to be true and Jack and Martha are exonerated. Following Sam's funeral, Jack and Martha get closer and she breaks up with Roman and they reunite. Martha proposes again and Jack accepts. Martha soon finds she is pregnant but is unsure of the child's paternity and they have a test which proves Roman is the biological father. Jack is upset but wants to stay with Martha regardless. They marry in the hospital chapel, but Martha is suffering from breast cancer; she collapses several hours later and suffers a miscarriage. Martha recovers after extensive chemotherapy. After acting on a tip from Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey), who works for the Coastal News, Jack investigates a development site where toxic waste is buried, causing a cancer cluster. He is upset and blames the developers for Martha's illness and is determined to bring them to justice. Jack visits the site at night and is shot in the chest by Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Tony arrives on the scene and tries to revive him but he is too late and Jack dies. He later reappears as a vision to a grief-stricken Martha.

The village is near the River Bourne and the A338 road and is close to Winterbourne Dauntsey. It is part of the civil parish of Winterbourne, formed in 1934 by amalgamating the three ancient parishes of Winterbourne Earls, Dauntsey and Gunner.

Location of the Saxon graves excavated by Time Team at . Toponymy and Archaeology The place-name 'Winterbourne Gunner' is first attested in 1275 in the Rotuli hundredorum, where it appears as Winterburn Gonnore. The name means 'winter river (ie. one dry in summer) belonging to Gunnora de la Mare', who held the manor in 1250, according to the Book of Fees in the National Archives. Gunnora is a Norman woman's name of Old Scandinavian origin, as in Old Norse Gunnvor or Gunnor.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.525. Winterbourne Gunner has considerable archaeological interest. In 1960 workmen digging a pipeline came across a series of early Saxon graves. A subsequent excavation showed them to be particularly rich in grave goods. A 1994 dig in a nearby building plot owned by villager, David Buckland by television programme Time Team (series 2, \\"The Saxon Graves\\") found several more early 6th century Saxon graves near Salt Lane, and discovered a series of Bronze Age features including a pond barrow and associated round barrows and urn burials, which the Saxons appear to have respected when selecting their burial sites. These show up as circular crop marks, with a diameter of 20 to 30 feet, indicating barrows. The Bronze Age features were designated as Scheduled Monuments in July 1994.Pastscape Scheduled Monument 966594 (A pond barrow and a bowl barrow 200 metres to the southeast of St Mary's Church, Winterbourne Gunner). In 1999 a house at Winterbourne Gunner was the subject of a Series 2 episode of the BBC television series Meet the Ancestors. Parish church St Mary's Church The Church of England parish church of St Mary was designated as a Grade I listed building on 18 February 1958. It has twelfth- and thirteenth-century origins with additions in 1687 and 1810, and a restoration in 1886. It is constructed of flint with limestone dressings. The twelfth-century tower is at the west end and is rendered and whitewashed, and topped with a pyramidal tiled roof. The nave is short, and a porch was added on the south side at the time the south aisle was removed. The interior has a fourteenth-century roof over the nave with arch-braced trussed rafters with a moulded central tie beam. The font is late twelfth or early thirteenth century while the panelled limestone pulpit is nineteenth century.

It is discussed only in the first half of Book VIII (there are only a couple of references to it elsewhere) and it does not appear in sections of the text written later. This indicates that it was an experiment that failed and was meant to be dropped. The notion of an \\"absolute form of war\\" is very clearly derived from the new style of warfare introduced by the French Revolution and brought to a high level of performance by Napoleon Bonaparte. Although it is presented as a philosophical concept, and thus probably not capable of perfect attainment in the real world, it was nonetheless modeled very closely on Napoleon's most masterful campaigns and was intended to be pursued or emulated by commanders \\"when possible.\\" Absolute war was characterized by very high levels of energy and professional competence, and it aims at the destruction of the opposing force and the attainment of a political decision by force of arms. It contrasts to a weaker, less competent‚Äîeven pointless‚Äîform Clausewitz called \\"war of observation,\\" based on the carefully circumscribed use of force in the century or so prior to the French Revolution. This two-ended framework appears to have been experimental. Clausewitz became quite critical of it by the middle of Book VIII‚Äîthereafter the term absolute war dropped out and the weak, befuddled nature of \\"war of observation\\" was transformed into a perfectly legitimate, respectable form called the \\"limited aim.\\" In Book I, drafted later, the term absolute war does not appear; for practical purposes, war in the real world is described using a spectrum bounded by the limited aim of wearing down the enemy's will to carry on the military struggle vice the most ambitious form available in reality, the aim of rendering one's opponent militarily helpless. Absolute War is often confused with the very different concept of \\"ideal war\\" featured in the first chapter of On War. In that discussion, Clausewitz explained that ideal war is a philosophical abstraction‚Äîa \\"logical fantasy\\"‚Äîthat is impossible in practice because it is not directed or constrained by political motives or concerns, nor limited by the practical constraints of time, space, and human nature. He called warfare constrained by these moderating real-world influences real war. Absolute War is also routinely confused with \\"Total War,\\" a term that does not appear on Vom Kriege. Ideal war can be seen to be an act of violence without compromise by mirror-image states pursuing objectives of the very highest importance, in which they fight to war's \\"logical\\" extremes; it is a war unaffected by political and moral considerations or moderation. In On War, Clausewitz explains what makes up this \\"ideal\\" (in a philosophical sense) war: The three Reciprocal Actions =The utmost use of force= Clausewitz states that \\"...it follows that he who uses force unsparingly; without reference to bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adversary uses less vigour in [the] application [of force].\\" Therefore, war in its most logical form would involve each state continually reciprocating each other's use of force (plus some) to maintain a superiority, until both were using violence to its utmost extent. This is the first reciprocal action, and leads to the first extreme of war. As stated in his text. =The aim is to disarm the enemy= Clausewitz stated that the logical purpose of war is to make the opponent comply with one's will. However, an opponent will obviously not do that unless it becomes the least oppressive of its available options. Therefore, in order to make the enemy comply with one's will, a state must place its adversary in a position that is more oppressive to it than compliance. Furthermore, that position cannot be temporary, or appear to be temporary. This is because it will be more likely that an enemy will simply 'ride out the storm' in the prospect of being in a better position at a later stage. Any change in this position would be a change for the worse, and so in order to best achieve this position a state must disarm its enemy (forcing it into a position from which it cannot resist). Furthermore, as war involves two (or more) hostile states, this principle applies to both, and so it becomes the second reciprocal action, whereby both try to impose such a position on the other. =An utmost exertion of powers= Here Clausewitz states that if a state wishes to defeat its enemies it must annihilate them. According to Clausewitz, the use of power involves two factors. The first is the strength of available means, which may be measured somewhat by numbers (although not entirely). The second factor is the strength of the will which cannot be specifically measured (only estimated) as it is intangible. Once a state has learned the enemy's strength of resistance it can review its own means and adjust them upwards accordingly in an effort to gain the advantage. As the enemy will also be doing this, it too becomes reciprocal (the third reciprocal action), creating a third push towards an extreme. Confusion with Total War The recognition of total war since the start of World War I has arguably created a degree of confusion for many scholars, who may have failed to understand the differences between it and the concept of absolute war, often using the terms interchangeably and blaming Germany's conduct of \\"total war\\" on the writings of Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. In reality, however, Clausewitz neither coined nor used the term \\"total war,\\" and \\"absolute (or ideal) war,\\" it is argued, is quite a different concept. Total war is essentially a war in which the home front (that is, a state's political system, society and economy) is mobilised to a massive degree for the continuation and expansion of the war effort‚Äîit implies the subordination of politics (internal and external) to the goal of purely military victory (a notion that Clausewitz would have regarded as nonsensical). It is characterised by civilian infrastructure and civilians themselves becoming highly involved in war as part of the military's logistical support system. Ideal war on the other hand, is a theoretical ideal in which war reaches its logical extremes (as mentioned above), which free it from the moderating effects that are imposed on it by politics and society, not to mention the practical constraints of time and space. As wars cannot run themselves and require politics and society to exist, Clausewitz held that ideal war was impossible because political and military leaders cannot avoid these influences. Much of the confusion over \\"absolute war\\" is the result of Clausewitz's personal intellectual evolution: the book was unfinished at the time of his untimely death and there are important contradictions between some of his earlier thinking and the most advanced elements, the latter being represented by the last half of Book VIII, Book I (the only part of Clausewitz's unfinished draft that he considered to be in finished form), and the \\"Note of 1827.\\" He never had the opportunity to bring the discussion of absolute war into accord with these later writings. Thus \\"absolute war\\" reflects an earlier conception advocating the more extreme reaches of the forms that Napoleonic warfare had actually achieved. That conception, however, was clearly rejected by the mature Clausewitz. Many analysts have assumed that the powerful description of ideal war in Book I must refer to the same concept, but in fact the two concepts are radically different and, in many respects, opposed. Clausewitz never seems to have resolved whether absolute war was supposed to reflect an achievable form or was instead an ideal to aim at, but just out of reach. Ideal war resolved that confusion by being blatantly unachievable in most of its aspects and reflecting an unrealistic idea of war that should not be pursued in real life.

He is particularly noted for his involvement in the mensal√£o scandal.  Background  A native of Goi√°s, Soares graduated with a degree in mathematics from the Catholic University of Goias. He is married to Monica Valente.  Career  Soares has been active in Brazilian politics since the 1970s, when he worked for the Amnesty Movement in Goi√¢nia (GO). During this period, he began to teach mathematics in public schools in Goi√°s and to participate in the coordination of teacher's strikes. He helped found the Central √önica dos Trabalhadores (CUT), at which he held the posts of Secretary of Trade Union Policy and Secretary of Finance, and the Trade Union of Education Workers of Goi√°s. He was also a coordinator of Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva's presidential campaigns in 1989 and 1998. He was a member of the National Directorate of the PT, held the position of Trade Union Secretary from 1995 to 2000, and became the treasurer of the PT. For many years, Soares was also part of the political group known as the Majoritarian Camp, which later changed its name to Building a New Brazil.  Mensal√£o scandal  On June 6, 2005, Brazilian deputy Roberto Jefferson told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper that the PT had paid some deputies 30,000 reais (then around US$12,000) per month apiece to vote for certain legislation favored by the party. This led to the so-called Mensal√£o scandal, ‚Äúmensal√£o‚Äù being a neologism referring to large monthly payments. After being identified as a key figure in the scandal, Soares was expelled from PT, a decision that was approved by a majority of votes in the National Directory. Soares was one of forty persons who were denounced to the Federal Supreme Court (STF) on March 30, 2006, by Attorney General Antonio Fernando de Souza for having been involved in the distribution of the secret payments. Souza described the group as a criminal organization and named Jos√© Dirceu, Jos√© Genoino, Silvio Pereira, and Del√∫bio as its leaders. Del√∫bio played a crucial role in the Mensal√£o scandal, causing a significant crisis for the Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva administration and nearly cost him his reelection. Of all the persons involved in the Mensal√£o scandal, Soares was the only one to be expelled from the party. Six years later, by a vote of 60 to 15, the PT's national directory permitted Soares to return to the party. In November 2012, Soares was sentenced by the STF to 8 years and 11 months in prison for conspiracy and racketeering in connection with the Mensal√£o scandal. After he appealed the sentence, the STF acquitted him of the charge of racketeering in 2014. In September 2014 he was permitted to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. In March 2016, he was pardoned for his participation in the scandal and released from prison.  Operation Car Wash  On April 1, 2016, Soares was one of the targets of the 27th phase of Operation Car Wash (Lava Jato). This phase of the operation was named Carbono 14 and it involved the R$12 million loan made by Banco Schahin to cattle rancher Jose Carlos Bumlai, half of which was funneled to Ronan Maria Pinto, owner of the newspaper Diario do Grande ABC. The fund was eventually spent on campaigns for political candidates supported by the PT. Soares was initially brought in as a witness but was indicted as a defendant in the Carbon 14 action for the crime of money laundering. Federal Judge Sergio Moro found him and four other defendants guilty, and sentenced him on March 2, 2017, to five years in prison, noting that he had previously been convicted of complicity in the Mensalao scandal and that the money laundering in this case was particularly sophisticated, in that two people were interposed between the source of the funds and their final destination and that the scheme had involved two false loan agreements. Soares appealed his conviction. After Bumlai was questioned again in February 2019, Soares asked in March 2019 that Bumlai be questioned yet again, claiming that in 2016 Bumlai's testimony had effectively absolved him, Soares, of guilt. In late March, a panel of judges denied requests to free Soares and others jailed in Operation Car Wash.

It is most often identified on X-ray films of the bones. Cause Examples of periosteal reactive bone in selected specimens of Triceratops A periosteal reaction can result from a large number of causes, including injury and chronic irritation due to a medical condition such as hypertrophic osteopathy, bone healing in response to fracture, chronic stress injuries, subperiosteal hematomas, osteomyelitis, and cancer of the bone. It may also occur as part of thyroid acropachy, a severe sign of the autoimmune thyroid disorder Graves' disease. Other causes include Menkes kinky hair syndrome and hypervitaminosis A. It can take about three weeks to appear. Diagnosis The morphological appearance can be helpful in determining the cause of a periosteal reaction (for example, if other features of periostitis are present), but is usually not enough to be definitive.

The Est√°dio Fonte Nova, also known as Est√°dio Oct√°vio Mangabeira, was a football stadium inaugurated on January 28, 1951 in Salvador, Bahia, with a maximum capacity of 66,080 people. The stadium was owned by the Bahia government, and was the home stadium of Esporte Clube Bahia and Esporte Clube Vit√≥ria. Its formal name honors Oct√°vio Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a civil engineer, journalist, and former Bahia state governor from 1947 to 1954. After part of the upper terraces collapsed in 2007, killing 7 people and injuring several others, the government of Bahia announced the demolition of Fonte Nova and the construction of a new stadium, the Arena Fonte Nova, in the same place. The stadium was nicknamed Fonte Nova because it was located at Ladeira das Fontes das Pedras. History The stadium construction ended in 1951. On March 4, 1971, the stadium was reinaugurated, after a great reformation involving the addition of a second tier, which expanded the maximum stadium capacity from 35,000 to 110,000. In the reinauguration day, two matches were played: Bahia against Flamengo, and Vit√≥ria against Gr√™mio. On that day happened a big tumult, where two people died. The inaugural match was played on January 28, 1951, when Guarany and Botafogo, both local Bahia state teams, drew 2-1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Guarany's N√©lson. The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 110,438, set on February 12, 1989 when Bahia beat Fluminense 2-1. On November 25, 2007, when the Brazilian Championship Third Division match between Bahia and Vila Nova was nearly over with more than 60,000 supporters in attendance, a section of the stadium's highest terraces collapsed when Bahia's supporters were celebrating the club's promotion to the Brazilian Championship Second Division, killing seven people and injuring forty others. Jacques Wagner, who is the governor of Bahia state, ordered the stadium to be closed as the causes of the accident are under investigation by the authorities, and he also said on November 26, 2007 that the stadium may be demolished if its structure is compromised. On November 27, 2007, the governor of Bahia announced that Est√°dio Fonte Nova will be demolished, and a new stadium will be built in its place. On September 28, 2008, Bahia's governor Jaques Wagner announced that instead of being demolished, the stadium will be reformed into a multiuse arena with a maximum capacity of 60,000 people seated. Demolition of the Octavio Mangabeira Stadium began in June 2010 and is expected to be finished by August - the upper tier was demolished using explosives on August 29, 2010.

The Delmatae (alternatively, Dalmatae in the Roman era) were a group of Illyrian tribes which lived in Dalmatia - which takes its name from them - and present-day western Bosnia and Herzegovina in classical antiquity. The Delmatae appear in historical record for the first time in 181 BCE, when upon the death of their ruler Pleuratus III of the Illyrian kingdom, they refused to accept the rule of his son, Gentius and seceded. They expanded and came to include coastal Illyrian tribes like the Hylli and the Nesti and increased their territory to the north against the Liburni. Conflict with Roman expansionism and its local allies in the eastern Adriatic began in 156-55 BC. The Roman‚ÄìDalmatae Wars lasted until 33 BC when Octavian (the later Emperor Augustus) installed Roman hegemony in Dalmatia. Local instability and minor rebellions continued in the province of Dalmatia and culminated in the Great Illyrian Revolt in Dalmatia and closely linked Pannonia in 6 CE. The revolt, which lasted for three years, involved more half a million combatants, auxiliaries and civilians on both side. In the aftermath, some Delmataean communities were relocated in the northern Sandzak region and others were resettled in parts of Carinthia to provide labor for the Roman mines. The defeat of the revolt began the integration of Dalmatia which in turn led to the romanization of the region by the early Middle Ages. Name The original name of the tribe is Delmatae. It appears to be connected to Albanian delm√´ (sheep). The form Dalmatae and the name of region Dalmatia respectively are later variants as is already noted by Appian (2nd century CE). His contemporary, the grammarian Velius Longus highlights in his treatise about orthography that the correct form of Dalmatia is Delmatia and notes that Marcus Terentius Varro, who lived about 2 centuries before Appian and Velius Longius, used the form Delmatia as it corresponded to the capital settlement of the Delmatae, Delminium. History The Delmatae appear in historical record in 181 BCE. The death of Pleuratus III of the Illyrian kingdom and the succession by his son Gentius led the Delmatae to not recognize his rule and secede altogether. The Daorsi, who lived to the south of the Delmatae did the same. Over the centuries, the Delmatae and Ardiaei were among the Illyrian groups which expanded their territory northwards at the expense of the Liburni. They Delmatae may have been originally pushed towards the coast because of Celtic migrations in Pannonia Strabo writes that the territory of the Delmatae was divided into an inland (present-day Tropolje) and a coastal region by the Dinaric Alps. Their capital settlement Delminium was located close to present-day Tomislavgrad. The first Dalmatian war in 156 BC ‚Äì 155 BC finished with the destruction of capital Delminium by consul Scipio Nasica. The second Dalmatian war was fought in 119‚Äì118 BC, apparently ending in Roman victory as consul L. Caecilius Metellus celebrated triumph in 117 BC and assumed his surname Delmaticus. The third Dalmatian war 78‚Äì76 BC finished with the capture of Salona (port Solin near modern city Split) by the proconsul C. Cosconius. During the Roman Civil War of 49‚Äì44 BC, the Delmatae supported Pompey against the coastal Roman colonies which supported Caesar and continuously fought against the Caesarian generals Gabinius and Vatinius. After Pompey's defeat they continued to fight against Roman legions in Dalmatia. The fourth and final conflict occurred 34‚Äì33 BC during Octavian's expedition to Illyricum because of their iterative revolts, and finished with the capture of the new Delmatian capital- Soetovio (now Klis). The last revolts of Delmatae under their federal leader Bato, against Romans were in 12 BC and the Great Illyrian Revolt in 6-9 AD; both also failed and finished by a terminal pacification of bellicose Delmatae. Afterwards, the Dalmatae formed numerous Roman auxiliaries: * Cohors I Delmatarum * Cohors I Delmatarum milliaria equitata * Cohors II Delmatarum * Cohors III Delmatarum equitata c.R. pf * Cohors IV Delmatarum * Cohors V Delmatarum * Cohors V Delmatarum c.R. * Cohors VI Delmatarum equitata * Cohors VII Delmatarum equitata * And later the Equites Dalmatae Culture and society Archaeology and onomastic shows that the Delmatae were akin to eastern Illyrians and northern Pannonii.The Illyrians by J.

The archeological remnants suggest their material culture was more primitive than those of the surrounding ancient tribes, especially in comparison with the oldest Liburnians. Only their production of weapons was rather advanced. Their elite had stone built houses only, but numerous Delmatic herdmen yet settled in natural caves, and a characteristic detail in their usual clothing was the fur cap. Their nomadic society had a strong patriarchal structure, consisting chiefly of shepherds, warriors and their chieftains. Their main jobs had been the extensive cattle breeding, and the iterative plundering of other surrounding tribes and of coastal towns on the Adriatic.

The third important one of Delmatae was a wargod 'Armatus' comparable with Roman Mars and Greek Ares. Their bad deity was the celestial Dragon devouring the sun or moon in the eclipses. A strong weapons cult was very specific for the patriarchal Delmatae, and in their masculine tombs different weapons are widely present (that is rare in neighbouring peoples e.g. Liburni, Iapydes, etc.). Their usual tombs were under the stone tumuli of kurgan type. After the classic Roman reports (Muzic 1998), nomadic Delmatae were extremely superstitious, and they had a primitive panic dread from all celestial phenomena: any view on the night stars was for them forbidden in the fear of a sure death, and in the case of solar or lunar eclipses they repeated tremendous collective howling because of the immediate world ending, made hysterical suicides etc. References  Sources   * * Category:Illyrian tribes Category:Illyrian Croatia Category:Ancient tribes in Croatia Category:History of Dalmatia Category:Ancient tribes in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Tribes conquered by Rome Category:Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina ","title":"Dalmatae"},{"id":"2426500","text":"Genesis Storytime was a cable TV channel founded in 1983 in Canada by Art Doerksen and Greg Stetski and distributed to several cable TV systems throughout the USA.

It displayed each page of a story on-screen, and would draw each page's graphics somewhat slowly, due to the technology of the time. There was no sound transmitted with the channel since Genesis Storytime was meant to be read out loud by a parent reading a story displayed to a child. Some cable TV companies, however, would feed some audio source (such as a terrestrial or satellite-fed radio station or other audio source received by the cable TV company) along with the channel in place of its silence. The books were redrawn digitally (using NAPLPS) because of the way Genesis Storytime was distributed to the cable TV headends. It relied on decoders originally used for the Canadian NAPLPS-based Telidon videotex system installed at the headend, with the graphical data for the stories to be displayed being fed to the Telidon decoders via a data stream. Satellite delivery to the headend began in November 1983 from Satellite Syndicated Systems, a company that distributed data for teletext and other services. The data was then decoded and displayed as graphics by the decoder, with the decoder's video output being fed to a cable TV channel. This meant that Genesis Storytime was distributed on a cable TV system as a regular channel viewable on any regular TV set, without any set-top decoder required. Genesis Storytime's logo was a red heart in a black box, which would blink in the corner of the screen whenever the next page was about to come up. Although being Canadian in origin, Genesis Storytime was mainly distributed in the USA because of Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulations that hindered the distribution of Genesis Storytime in Canada. VSP-7, a public-access channel in Winnipeg, did air the channel as a 30-minute program on the schedule, ending the program even if a story was not completed. Genesis Research Corporation was not allowed to appear before the CRTC in early 1984 (the Hearings that lead to the licensing of MuchMusic, TSN, Telelatino) because they had filed an incomplete application. Contracts were signed with the publishers of the children's books for converting the content to Telidon Format. Genesis StoryTime was later known as StoryVision Network, and then was closed down in 1997. Decades later, finding any trace of Genesis StoryTime on the Internet leaves very few results because most people did not record the channel from cable-tv to home videotape formats.

Route description Start of Oregon Route 47 in Clatskanie, Oregon Oregon Route 47 begins (at its southern terminus) at a junction with Oregon Route 99W between the cities of McMinnville and Lafayette.http://egov.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TDATA/rics/docs/NumRouteMap_enl.pdf Portland Area Enlargement of map of State of Oregon Highway system-2006 This stretch is known as the Tualatin Valley Highway. It continues north along the western edge of the Willamette Valley, hugging the Coast Range. It passes through parts of Oregon's wine country (and some prime agricultural land), and through small towns such as Carlton, Yamhill, and Gaston. The first large city encountered is Forest Grove. A bypass around the east side of town avoids the downtown area. In Forest Grove, OR 47 intersects Oregon Route 8, and the Tualatin Valley Highway leaves Oregon Route 47, and continues east towards Hillsboro and Beaverton on Oregon Route 8. North of the intersection, OR 47 is known as the Nehalem Highway. It continues north, passing through the town of Banks. North of Banks, OR 47 shares an alignment for about 4 miles (6 km) with U.S. Route 26 over the Sunset Highway, which is‚Äîa bit confusingly‚ÄîHighway 47. North of Manning, OR 47 and US 26 part ways. OR 47 continues north, following the North Fork of Dairy Creek to its source and passing L.L. \\"Stub\\" Stewart Memorial State ParkOfficial State Parks Fact Sheet and shortly thereafter reaching the summit called \\"Tophill\\" where the highway departs the Willamette River drainage and enters the Nehalem drainage. From Tophill, the highway quickly winds down to a tributary of the Nehalem River and finds the Nehalem River at the extinct community of Treharne. Apiary Junction 47 in Banks Though in the mountainous Northern Oregon Coast Range, the Nehalem Highway itself is just winding, as it follows the banks of the Nehalem River all the way to Jewell,The Nehalem River Highway, Jeffrey Butts passing through Vernoniahttp://egov.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TDATA/rics/docs/NumRouteMap.pdf State of Oregon Highway System Route Map 2006 and Pittsburg. However, Pittsburg is little more than a road junction where the Scappoose-Vernonia Road breaks off and heads up the East Fork of the Nehalem River for Scappoose, Oregon. A few miles further north, Route 47 reaches the Apiary junction with destinations for Apiary and Rainier. The Apiary road is popular with truckers as it does not have the restrictive length limitations which are applied to OR 47 North of Mist or Oregon Route 202 west of Jewell because of numerous short turns. After the town of Mist, the Nehalem Highway continues west towards Astoria as Oregon Route 202; OR 47 continues north for as the Mist-Clatskanie Highway. This stretch of OR 47 is rather mountainous, with many sharp turns and steep grades. Eventually, OR 47 descends out of the mountains into the Columbia River basin, and ends in the city of Clatskanie at an intersection with U.S. Route 30.

Their territory was located inland from the Ardiaei and the Lake Skodra, extending east to the Dardani and north or northeast to the Triballi. Along with the Ardiaei and the Dardani, the Autariatae are mentioned by Strabo in his Geographica as one of the three strongest Illyrian peoples in the pre-Roman Balkans. Following defeat during the Celtic invasions of the Balkans in the 4th century, a part of the Autariatae who remained in Bosnia adopted Celtic culture later in their history.Dalmatia Tome 2 of History of the provinces of the Roman Empire by J. J. Wilkes, 1969, page 400 Another part moved southwards and after an agreement with the Kingdom of Macedonia, 20,000 settled in the Parorbelian mountain range, in the borderlands between modern southeastern North Macedonia, northern Greece and southwestern Bulgaria.  History  Tara river canyon at ƒêurƒëeviƒáa Tara, Montenegro. The name Tara is thought to be related to the Autariatae, whose territory included the river valley in classical antiquity. Greek mythology attributes a progenitor to the Autariatae, son of Illyrius called Autarieus (). The Autariatae communities unified into a single political entity during the late 6th century BC. They began to expand eastward into territories controlled by the Triballi. Moreover, they expanded southward where they defeated the Ardiaei, their old rivals, in struggles for control over pastures and salty springs. Activities of the Autariatae at the turn of the 6th and 5th centuries BC profoundly influenced the peoples who were directly affected by their expansion. The Ardiaei were moved toward the coasts and the Triballi to the east. The expansion of the Autariatae enabled them to achieve hegemonic control over one part of the interior of the Balkan Peninsula. The leading class of the Autariatae society reached the peak of its political and economic development indicated through many great luxurious royal tumuli and graves created during the 5th century BC. Strabo‚Äôs comment on the Autariatae as \\"the once greatest and most powerful Illyrian people\\" most likely refers to this period. Their peak of development was followed by the gradual decline of the Autariatae ending in 310 BC with their sudden disappearance due to Celtic migrations. Appian (95 ‚Äì 165) writes that the Ardiaei were destroyed by the Autariatae and that in contrast to the Autariatae had maritime power.App. Ill. 1,\\"In like manner the Ardi√¶i, who were distinguished for their maritime power, were finally destroyed by the Autarienses, whose land forces were stronger, but whom they had often defeated.\\" He also reports that the Autariatae were punished by Apollo for raiding the Pythian Oracle together with the Celtic Cimbri, after which moment they migrated to the lands of the Getae near the tribe of Bastarnae.App. Ill. 1.4,\\"The Autarienses were overtaken with destruction by the vengeance of Apollo. Having joined Molostimus and the Celtic people called Cimbri in an expedition against the temple of Delphi, the greater part of them were destroyed by storm, hurricane, and lightning just before the sacrilege was committed; ‚Ä¶ At last they fled from their homes, and as the plague still clung to them (and for fear of it nobody would receive them), they came, after a journey of twenty-three days, to a marshy and uninhabited district of the Get√¶, where they settled near the Bastarn√¶.\\" This could be an explanation why the Autariatae \\"disappear\\" after 310 B.C., according to Wilkes. The ancient geographer, Strabo, lists the Autariatae as one of the three strongest tribes - the other two being the Ardiaei and the Dardanii. The Autariatae and the Celtic Scordisci are thought to have merged into one tribe in the Lower Morava valley, after 313 BC, since excavations show that the two groups made burials at the same exact grave field in Pecine, near Kostolac.Jovanoviƒá 1984, 1985, 1991; Theodossiev 2000: 120-121, cat. no. 113 with full bibliography Nine graves of Autariatae dating to 4th century BC and scattered Autariatae and Celtic graves around these earlier graves show that the two groups mixed rather than made warJovanoviƒá 1985, 1992 and this resulted in the lower Morava valley becoming a Celto-Thraco-Illyrian interaction zone.http://www.caorc.org/programs/mellonpubs/Theodossiev.pdf  Cultural practices  A standard practice of the Autariatae entailed killing their weak and wounded. This was meant to prevent meek individuals from falling into the hands of their enemies. This practice perhaps was motivated by the superstitious belief that the enemy, by drinking the blood of prisoners and by eating parts of their bodies containing their virtues, would become even stronger and acquire a special power over the entire community of the Autariatae. The Autariatae left a legacy of material wealth. So far, more than 100 castle ruins were identified to have been inhabited by the Autariatae, as well as thousands of tumuli in which they had been buried. Movable materials (mostly jewelry and weapons) reveal all specific features associated with the ethno-cultural originality of the Autariatae. The Autariatae established a continuous tradition of manufacturing metal and ceramic products. Artifacts consisting of metal sheets with luxurious golden and silver belts of Mramorac type indicate the complexity of this tradition. The Autariatae are a classic example of a \\"highland\\" people who also show all the characteristics of a \\"highland\\" mentality (i.e. preservation of old beliefs). Case in point, the Autariatae have strongly maintained their burial customs of burning the dead in tumuli, which did not change until the end of the Glasinac culture. Archaeological remains indicate that the religious life of the Autariatae was influenced by both their ancestor cult and the cult of their solar god. One can find the numerous evidence of the solar cult throughout the territories once controlled by the Autariatae. The Autariatae economy was based on cattle breeding, metalwork, handicraft and trade. Because of its need for Greek and Italic goods, this Illyrian tribe was one of the biggest trade partners of the western and central Balkans to both Greek and Italic traders between the 7th and 6th centuries BC.

Nicknamed \\"Iron Arm\\", he ranks 94th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 58th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Living in Daming Prefecture (Â§ßÂêçÂ∫ú; present-day Daming County, Hebei), Cai Fu is the chief warden of the city's prison and also its chief executioner assisted by his younger brother Cai Qing. Cai Fu is nicknamed \\"Iron Arm\\" because he can chop off a prisoner's head with just one swing of the sword saving the person unnecessary pain. Joining Liangshan Lu Junyi, a squire of Daming, is arrested and jailed after his housekeeper Li Gu, who is having an affair with Lu's wife, reports him to the authorities that he has ties with the bandits of Liangshan. Lu has earlier been lured to Liangshan, which failed to persuade him to join them. Li Gu bribes Cai Fu, the warden in charge of Lu Junyi in prison, to murder the squire. However, Liangshan's Chai Jin also visits Cai Fu and offers him an even larger sum of money to ensure Lu is safe. Not wanting to antagonise either, Cao Fu is in a bind. Cai Qing advises him to bribe officials to exile Lu to a faraway place, thereby washing his hands of the case. However, Li Gu bribes the guards escorting Lu Junyi to Shamen Island (Ê≤ôÈñÄÂ≥∂; present-day Changdao County, Shandong) to murder him along the way. Lu's servant Yan Qing kills the escorts and saves Lu when they are about to finish him off in a wood. But Lu, who is weak from days of torture, is captured again at an inn when Yan goes look for food. This time, he is immediately sentenced to death. Just when Cai Fu is about to swing his sabre to chop off Lu's head at a public execution ground, the brothers are gladly stunned by Shi Xiu of Liangshan, who storms towards them in a lone attempt to save the squire. The brothers, who do not want to be in the black book of Liangshan, subtly loosen the ropes on Lu and allow Shi Xiu to drag him away. But the two are overwhelmed by the soldiers and captured. Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, the governor of Daming, decides to keep them alive as bargaining chips should Liangshan mount an attack. The Cai brothers take good care of Lu and Shi in prison. Liangshan could not break into Daming despite winning a few military battles. After a respite that caused Daming to become less vigilant, Wu Yong, Liangshan's chief strategist, sends a number of chieftains to infiltrate Daming on the night of the Lantern Festival. When they unleash havoc in the city cued by a fire set by Shi Qian, Chai Jin visits the prison to coerce the Cai brothers to free Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu. Knowing they have no choice, the Cais release the two prisoners and follow the outlaws back to Liangshan. Campaigns and death Cai Fu is appointed Lianghsan's chief executioner after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. In the battle of Qingxi County (Ê∏ÖÊ∫™Á∏£; present-day Chun'an County, Zhejiang) in the campaign against the rebel leader Fang La, Cai Fu is critically injured. He later dies from the wounds.

Newman was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, in 1602, son of Richard Newman. He graduated from Trinity College, Oxford in 1620, took orders in the Church of England. He was prosecuted for nonconformity and emigrated to Massachusetts Bay Colony, probably in 1636. After preaching nearly two years at Dorchester, he became pastor of the church at Weymouth, where he remained until 1643. The following year he removed with part of his church to Seconet, in Plymouth Colony. There they founded the town of Rehoboth, which then embraced what is now Seekonk, Massachusetts and Rumford, Rhode Island. He died in Rehoboth on July 5, 1663. Newman's famous Concordance was the third in English ever published and greatly superior to its two predecessors. The first edition was published in London in 1643, just before Newman's removal from Weymouth to Rehoboth. At Rehoboth, he revised and greatly improved it, using in the evening (according to Ezra Stiles, a President of Yale) pine knots instead of candles. The second edition was published at Cambridge in 1662 and the concordance was usually known after that as the Cambridge Concordance. The concordance was reprinted at least as late as 1889, almost 250 years after it was first published.

He is mostly famous for being the first to describe the pulmonary circulation of the blood. The work of Ibn al-Nafis regarding the right sided (pulmonary) circulation pre-dates the later work (1628) of William Harvey's De motu cordis. Both theories attempt to explain circulation. 2nd century Greek physician Galen's theory about the physiology of the circulatory system remained unchallenged until the works of Ibn al- Nafis, for which he has been described as \\"the father of circulatory physiology\\". As an early anatomist, Ibn al-Nafis also performed several human dissections during the course of his work, making several important discoveries in the fields of physiology and anatomy. Besides his famous discovery of the pulmonary circulation, he also gave an early insight of the coronary and capillary circulations. He was also appointed as the chief physician at al-Naseri Hospital founded by Sultan Saladin. Apart from medicine, Ibn al-Nafis studied jurisprudence, literature and theology. He was an expert on the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence and an expert physician. The number of medical textbooks written by Ibn al-Nafis is estimated at more than 110 volumes. Biography Ibn al-Nafis was born in 1213 to an Arab family probably at a village near Damascus named Karashia, after which his Nisba might be derived. Early in his life, he studied theology, philosophy and literature. Then, at the age of 16, he started studying medicine for more than ten years at the Nuri Hospital in Damascus, which was founded by the Turkish Prince Nur-al Din Muhmud ibn Zanki, in the 12th century. He was contemporary with the famous Damascene physician Ibn Abi Usaibia and they both were taught by the founder of a medical school in Damascus, Al-Dakhwar. Ibn Abi Usaibia does not mention Ibn al-Nafis at all in his biographical dictionary \\"Lives of the Physicians\\". The seemingly intentional omission could be due to personal animosity or maybe rivalry between the two physicians. In 1236, Ibn al-Nafis, along with some of his colleagues, moved to Egypt under the request of the Ayyubid sultan al-Kamil. Ibn al-Nafis was appointed as the chief physician at al-Naseri hospital which was founded by Saladin, where he taught and practiced medicine for several years. One of his most notable students was the famous Christian physician Ibn al-Quff. Ibn al-Nafis also taught jurisprudence at al- Masruriyya Madrassa (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ©). His name is found among those of other scholars, which gives insight into how well he was regarded in the study and practice of religious law. Ibn al-Nafis lived most of his life in Egypt, and witnessed several pivotal events like the fall of Baghdad and the rise of Mamluks. He even became the personal physician of the sultan Baibars and other prominent political leaders, thus showcasing himself as an authority among practitioners of medicine. Later in his life, when he was 74 old, Ibn al-Nafis was appointed as the chief physician of the newly founded al-Mansori hospital where he worked for the rest of his life. Ibn al-Nafis died in Cairo after some days of sickness. His student Safi Aboo al-fat'h composed a poem about him. Prior to his death, he donated his house and library to Qalawun Hospital or, as it was also known, the House of Recovery. Writings The opening page of one of Ibn al-Nafis' medical works. This is probably a copy made in India during the 17th or 18th century. =The Comprehensive Book on Medicine= The most voluminous of his books is Al-Shamil fi al-Tibb (The Comprehensive Book on Medicine), which was planned to be an encyclopedia comprising 300 volumes. However, Ibn al-Nafis managed to publish only 80 before his death, and the work was left incomplete. Despite this fact, the work is considered one of the largest medical encyclopedias ever written by one person, and it gave a complete summary of the medical knowledge in the Islamic world at the time. Ibn al-Nafis bequeathed his encyclopedia along with all of his library to the Mansoory hospital where he had worked before his death. Along the time, much of the encyclopedia volumes got lost or dispersed all over the world with only 2 volumes still being extant in Egypt. The Egyptian scholar Youssef Ziedan started a project of collecting and examining the extant manuscripts of this work that are cataloged in many libraries around the world, including the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Library, and the Lane Medical Library at Stanford University. =Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon= Sharh Tashrih al-Qanun (\\"Commentary on Anatomy in Books I and II of Ibn Sina's Kitab al-Qanun\\"), published when Ibn al-Nafis was only 29 years old, still it is regarded by many as his most famous work. While it did not prove to be as popular as his medical encyclopedia in the Islamic circles, the book is of great interest today specially for science historians who are mostly concerned with its celebrated discovery of the pulmonary circulation. The book discusses the anatomical concepts of Avicenna's Canon. It starts with a preface in which Ibn al-Nafis talks about the importance of the anatomical knowledge for the physician, and the vital relationship between anatomy and physiology. He then proceeds to discuss the anatomy of the body which he divides into two types; the general anatomy which is the anatomy of the bones, muscles, nerves, veins and arteries; and special anatomy which is concerned with the internal parts of the body like the heart and lungs. What distinguish the book most is the confident language which Ibn al-Nafis shows throughout the text and his boldness to challenge the most established medical authorities of the time like Galen and Avicenna. Ibn al- Nafis, thus, was one of the few medieval physicians‚Äîif not the only one‚Äîwho contributed noticeably to the science of physiology and tried to push it beyond the hatch of the Greco-Roman tradition. = Commentary on Hippocrates' \\"Nature of Man\\" = The particular manuscript of Ibn al-Nafis' commentary on Hippocrates' Nature of Man is preserved by the National Library of Medicine. It is unique and significant because it is the only recorded copy that contains the commentary from Ibn al-Naf√Øs on the Hippocratic treatise on the Nature of Man. Al-Naf√Øs's commentary on the Nature of Man is found in Sharh Tabi'at al-Insan li-Burqrat. It offers an idea of medical education during this period, in the form of an ijaza included with the text. This document reveals that Ibn al-Naf√Øs had a student named of Shams al-Dawlah Ab√º al-Fadi ibn Ab√Ø al-Hasan al-Mas√Øh√Ø, who successfully read and mastered a reading course associated with the treatise, after which al-Mas√Øh√Ø received this license from Ibn al-Naf√Øs. Based on evidence from commentaries such as this one, modern scholars know that physicians in this era received a license when they completed a particular part of their training. = Commentary on \\"Endemics\\" = In the second half of the thirteenth century, Ibn al-Naf√Øs composed the first Arabic commentary on Hippocrates' Endemics. The commentary is lengthy and contains two extant manuscripts, made up of 200 and 192 folios. Ibn al-Naf√Øs‚Äô commentary on Hippocrates‚Äô Endemics in Sharh Abidhimya li- Burqrat is an analysis of Hippocrates three constitutions. Al-Naf√Øs revisited the cases of illnesses described by Hippocrates in his text, while comparing and contrasting those cases to his own cases and conclusions. In his commentary, al-Naf√Øs emphasized disease outbreaks. In one example, he compared a particular outbreak of malnutrition in Damascus, Syria, to an outbreak described by Hippocrates. Like Hippocrates, al-Naf√Øs constructed an outbreak map and both men concluded that Damascus was the origin of the outbreak. This method of locating an outbreak origin was used by John Snow 600 years later, when he constructed his own outbreak map. =Other works= Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a number of books and commentaries on different topics including on medicine, law, logic, philosophy, theology, grammar and environment. His commentaries include one on Hippocrates' book, several volumes on Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine, and a commentary on Hunayn Ibn Ishaq. *al-M≈´jaz fƒ´ al- Tibb (‚ÄúA Summary of Medicine‚Äù); a short outline of medicine which was very popular among Arab physicians and got translated into Turkish and Hebrew. *KitƒÅb al-MukhtƒÅr fƒ´ al-Agh·∏èiyah (‚ÄúThe Choice of Foodstuffs‚Äù); a largely original contribution which was on the effects of diet on health.L.

Anatomical discoveries A manuscript page from Ibn al-Nafis' Commentary on Avicenna's Canon. In 1924, Egyptian physician, Muhyo Al-Deen Altawi, discovered a manuscript entitled, Sharh tashrih al-qanun li‚Äô Ibn Sina, or \\"Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon\\" in the Prussian State Library in Berlin while studying the history of Arabic Medicine at the medical faculty of Albert Ludwig's University. This manuscript covers in detail the topics of anatomy, pathology, and physiology. This is the earliest description of pulmonary circulation. =Pulmonary circulation= The most commonly accepted theory of cardiac function prior to Ibn al-Nafis was that of Galen. Galen taught that the blood reaching the right side of the heart went through invisible pores in the cardiac septum, to the left side of the heart, where it mixed with air to create spirit, and was then distributed to the body. According to Galen, the venous system was separate from the arterial system except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. The newly-discovered manuscript of Ibn al-Nafis was translated by Max Meyerhof. It included critiques of Galen's theory, including a discussion on the pores of the heart. Based on animal dissection, Galen hypothesized porosity in the septum in order for blood to travel within the heart as well as additional help on the part of the lungs. However, he could not observe these pores and so thought they were too small to see. ‚ÄúIbn al-Nafƒ´s's critiques were the result of two processes: an intensive theoretical study of medicine, physics, and theology in order to fully understand the nature of the living body and its soul; and an attempt to verify physiological claims through observation, including dissection of animals.‚Äù Ibn al-Nafis rejected Galen's theory in the following passage: > The blood, after it has been refined in the right cavity, must be > transmitted to the left cavity where the (vital) spirit is generated. But > there is no passage between these cavities, for the substance of the heart > is solid in this region and has neither a visible passage, as was thought by > some persons, nor an invisible one which could have permitted the > transmission of blood, as was alleged by Galen. He posited that the \\"pores\\" of the heart are closed, that there is no passage between the two chambers, and the substance of the heart is thick. Instead, Ibn al-Nafis hypothesized that blood rose into the lungs via the arterial vein and then circulated into the left cavity of the heart. He also believed that blood (spirit) and air passes from the lung to the left ventricle and not in the opposite direction. Some points that conflict with Ibn al-Nafis' are that there are only two ventricles instead of three (Aristotle's, 4th Century BC) and that the ventricle gets its energy from the blood flowing in the vessels running in the coronary vessels, not from blood deposited in the right ventricle. Based on his anatomical knowledge, Ibn al-Nafis stated: > Blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the left chamber, > but there is no direct pathway between them. The thick septum of the heart > is not perforated and does not have visible pores as some people thought or > invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from the right chamber must flow > through the vena arteriosa (pulmonary artery) to the lungs, spread through > its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa > (pulmonary vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart, and there form the > vital spirit....The Pursuit of Learning in the Islamic World, 610‚Äì2003 By > Hunt Janin, Pg99Saints and saviours of Islam, By Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, p. > 295 Elsewhere in this work, he said: > The heart has only two ventricles...and between these two there is > absolutely no opening. Also dissection gives this lie to what they said, as > the septum between these two cavities is much thicker than elsewhere. The > benefit of this blood (that is in the right cavity) is to go up to the > lungs, mix with what air is in the lungs, then pass through the arteria > venosa to the left cavity of the two cavities of the heart; and of that > mixture is created the animal spirit. =Coronary circulation= Ibn al-Nafis also postulated that nutrients for heart are extracted from the coronary arteries: > Again his [Avicenna's] statement that the blood that is in the right side is > to nourish the heart is not true at all, for the nourishment to the heart is > from the blood that goes through the vessels that permeate the body of the > heart. =Capillary circulation= Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that \\"there must be small communications or pores (manafidh in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein,\\" a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years. Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body: > For this reason the arterious vein has solid substance with two layers, in > order to make more refined that (the blood) which transsudes from it. The > venous artery, on the other hand, has thin substance in order to facilitate > the reception of the transsuded [blood] from the vein in question. And for > the same reason there exists perceptible passages (or pores) between the two > [blood vessels]. =Pulsation= Ibn al-Nafis also disagreed with Galen's theory that the heart's pulse is created by the arteries‚Äô tunics. He believed that \\"the pulse was a direct result of the heartbeat, even observing that the arteries contracted and expanded at different times depending upon their distance from the heart. He also correctly observed that the arteries contract when the heart expands and expand when the heart contracts. =Lungs= In describing the anatomy of the lungs, Ibn al-Nafis said: > The lungs are composed of parts, one of which is the bronchi; the second, > the branches of the arteria venosa; and the third, the branches of the vena > arteriosa, all of them connected by loose porous flesh.....The need of the > lungs for the vena arteriosa is to transport to it the blood that has been > thinned and warmed in the heart, so that what seeps through the pores of the > branches of this vessel into the alveoli of the lungs may mix with what > there is of air therein and combine with it, the resultant composite > becoming fit to be spirit when this mixing takes place in the left cavity of > the heart. The mixture is carried to the left cavity by the arteria venosa. It is also found that \\"In the lungs, some blood was filtered through the two tunics (coverings) of the vessel that brought blood to the lungs from the heart. Ibn al-Nafƒ´s called this vessel the ‚Äòartery-like vein‚Äô, but we now call it the pulmonary artery.\\" =Brain= Ibn al-Nafis was also one of the few physicians at the time, who supported the view that the brain, rather than the heart, was the organ responsible for thinking and sensation. Other medical contributions =Practice of dissection= There is some debate about whether or not Ibn al-Nafis participated in dissection to come to his conclusions about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that Ibn al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge about the human heart could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in Ibn al-Nafis' writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions about the human heart and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis' comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question. During Ibn al-Nafis‚Äô studies of the human body, dissection was prohibited by law in Islam, but was not mentioned in any texts on jurisprudence or Islamic tradition. Though many scholars would argue that Ibn al-Nafis would have needed to perform dissection to be able to see pulmonary circulation. Greek physician, Aelius Galenus' book, ‚ÄúOn the Usefulness of the Parts‚Äù, explicitly tells his readers to rely on dissection for anatomical knowledge and not rely on books. Thus would give an indication that dissection was not some otherworldly idea but had been looked as an opportunity to better one's knowledge of the human body. In the ‚ÄúCommentary of the anatomy of the Canon of Avicenna‚Äù, human anatomy experts such as Patrice Le Floch-Prigent and Dominique Delaval, concluded that Ibn al-Nafis used clinical, physiological, and dissection results were used in discovering and describing the pulmonary heart circulation in humans. Through their study on the ‚ÄúCommentary of the anatomy of the Canon of Avicenna‚Äù, they both concluded that Nafis did indeed used dissection to acquire his results, even though the practice of dissection was banned in Muslim tradition. = Urology = In his book \\"Al-Mujaz\\", Ibn al-Nafis distinguishes the difference between kidney stone and bladder stones. He does this by their pathogenesis and clinical picture. He also discussed the difference between kidney and bladder infections, different types of inflammatory and noninflammatory renal swellings, the conservative management of renal stones and commonly used and well known lithontriptic medicaments. =Surgery= In his Kitab al-Shamil, Ibn al-Nafis gives insight into his view of medicine and human relations. His surgical technique had three stages. Step one which he calls \\"the stage of presentation for clinical diagnosis\\" was to give the patient information on how it was to be performed and the knowledge it was based on. Second \\"the operative stage\\" was to perform the surgery itself. The final step was to have a post-surgery appointment and a routine of checkups which he calls \\"the postoperative period\\". There is also a description of a surgeon's responsibility when working with nurses, patients, or other surgeons. =Metabolism= Ibn al-Nafis is also credited with providing the earliest recorded reference for the concept of metabolism: > Both the body and its parts are in a continuous state of dissolution and > nourishment, so they are inevitably undergoing permanent change. Theology Ibn al-Nafis' philosophical views are mostly known from his philosophical novel, Theologus Autodidactus. The novel touches upon a variety of philosophical subjects like cosmology, empiricism, epistemology, experimentation, futurology, eschatology,and natural philosophy. It deals with these themes and others through the story of a feral child on a desert island, and the development of his mind after contact with the outside world. The plot of Theologus Autodidactus was intended to be a response to Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), who wrote the first Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus) which was itself a response to al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers. Ibn al-Nafis thus wrote the narrative of Theologus Autodidactus as a rebuttal of Abubacer's arguments in Philosophus Autodidactus. Ibn al-Nafis described his book Theologus Autodidactus as a defense of \\"the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.\\" He presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysical claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.Nahyan A.G. Fancy (2006), \\"Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafƒ´s (d. 1288)\\", pp. 42, 60, Electronic Theses and Dissertations, University of Notre Dame. Unlike Avicenna who supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the heart, Ibn al- Nafis on the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul \\"is related to the entirety and not to one or a few organs.\\" He further criticized Aristotle's idea that every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Ibn al-Nafis concluded that \\"the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul\\" and he defined the soul as nothing other than \\"what a human indicates by saying ‚ÄòI‚Äô.\\"Nahyan A.G. Fancy (2006), \\"Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafƒ´s (d. 1288)\\", pp. 209‚Äì10 (Electronic Theses and Dissertations, University of Notre Dame). Ibn al-Nafis dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his Theologus Autodidactus, where he rationalized the Islamic view of eschatology using reason and science to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic tradition. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of Arabic fiction, hence his Theologus Autodidactus may be considered the earliest science fiction work.Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), \\"Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher\\", Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis, Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait (cf. Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher , Encyclopedia of Islamic World). Possible Western influence There is currently debate over whether Ibn al-Nafis influenced later Western anatomists such as Realdo Columbo and William Harvey.Said, Hakim. \\"Knowledge of the circulation of the blood from Antiquity down to Ibn al-Nafis\\", Hamdard medicus,, p. 35, 1994Ghalioungui, P. \\"Was Ibn al-Nafis unknown to the scholars of the European Renaissance?\\", Clio medica,, p. 37, 1983 In AD 1344, Kazrouny wrote a verbatim copy of Ibn al-Nafis' commentary on Canon in his Sharh al- Kulliyat.Said, Hakim. \\"Knowledge of the circulation of the blood from Antiquity down to Ibn al-Nafis\\", Hamdard medicus,, p32, 1994Ghalioungui, P. \\"Was Ibn al-Nafis unknown to the scholars of the European Renaissance?\\", Clio medica,, p. 38, 1983 In AD 1500, Andrea Alpago returned to Italy after studying in Damascus.Said, Hakim. \\"Knowledge of the circulation of the blood from Antiquity down to Ibn al-Nafis\\", Hamdard medicus,, p. 34, 1994 In Alpago's 1547 A.D. publication of Libellus de removendis nocumentis, quae accident in regimime sanitatis, there is a Latin translation containing part of Ibn al-Nafis' commentary on pharmacopeia. This was published in Venice during its rule over Padua. Harvey arrived in Padua in AD 1597.Said, Hakim. \\"Knowledge of the circulation of the blood from Antiquity down to Ibn al- Nafis\\", Hamdard medicus,, p. 36, 1994 The debate currently turns on whether these events are causally connected or are historical coincidences. Legacy Ibn al-Nafis mastery of medical sciences, his prolific writings, and also his image as a devout religious scholar left a positive impression on later Muslim biographers and historians, even among conservative ones like al-Dhahabi. He had been described as the greatest physician of his time, with some even referring to him as \\"the second Ibn Sina\\". Years before Ibn al-Nafis was born, Galenic physiology and anatomy dominated the Arabic medical tradition from the time of Hunayn ibn Ishaq (AD 809‚Äì873). Medical authorities at the time seldom challenged the underlying principles of this system. What set Al-Nafis apart as a physician was his boldness in challenging Galen's work. In studying yet criticizing the Galenic system, he formed his own medical hypotheses. Ibn al- Nafis importance in the history of medicine was not fully recognized in the western circles until quite recently. The majority of his works remained unknown in the west until their re-discovery at the beginning of the 20th century. Since then, a new evaluation of his work has been carried out, with a specific appreciation being given to his physiological observations which were ahead of their time. For science historians, Ibn al-Nafis is sometimes regarded as \\"the greatest physiologist of the middle ages\\". George Sarton, in his \\"Introduction to the History of Science\\", written about the time Ibn al- Nafis's theory had just been discovered, said: > If the authenticity of Ibn al-Nafis' theory is confirmed his importance will > increase enormously; for he must then be considered one of the main > forerunners of William Harvey and the greatest physiologist of the Middle > Ages.

He was of the noble Frankish lineage of the Bosonids, descended from Boso the Elder. His father and predecessor was Hugh of Provence, great grandson of Lothair II, King of Lotharingia, and his mother was a German princess named Alda (or Hilda). Although he held the title of rex Italiae, he never succeeded in exercising power there. He was betrothed in 931 and married, 12 December 947, to the fifteen-year-old Adelaide,Odilo of Cluny gives her age at her marriage as \\"in her sixteenth year.\\" the spirited and intelligent daughter of Rudolph II of Burgundy and Bertha of Swabia. Their marriage was part of a political settlement designed to conclude a peace between her father and his. In 933, Hugh of Arles had given up his kingdom (Provence) to his inveterate enemy Rudolph II, who merged the two kingdoms into a new Kingdom of Arles, but died in 937. The couple had a daughter, Emma, born as early as 948, who was married in 966 to the Carolingian Lothair of France. Lothair's power in Italy was nominal. From the time of the successful uprising of the nobles in 945, when Hugh was forced into exile, Berengar of Ivrea kept all real power and patronage in his hands. Lothair died at Turin, perhaps poisoned by Berengar, who attempted to cement his usurped political power in Lombardy by forcing Lothair's widow to marry his son Adalbert. Instead she entreated the protection of Otto I of Germany, whom she married. Lothair figures briefly in the vita of Adelaide written by Hroswitha of Gandersheim.

As a process that influences preferences, decisions, and behavior, affective forecasting is studied by both psychologists and economists, with broad applications.  History  Kahneman and Snell began research on hedonic forecasts in the early 1990s, examining its impact on decision making. The term \\"affective forecasting\\" was later coined by psychologists Timothy Wilson and Daniel Gilbert. Early research tended to focus solely on measuring emotional forecasts, while subsequent studies began to examine the accuracy of forecasts, revealing that people are surprisingly poor judges of their future emotional states. For example, in predicting how events like winning the lottery might affect their happiness, people are likely to overestimate future positive feelings, ignoring the numerous other factors that might contribute to their emotional state outside of the single lottery event. Some of the cognitive biases related to systematic errors in affective forecasts are focalism, empathy gap, and impact bias.  Applications  While affective forecasting has traditionally drawn the most attention from economists and psychologists, their findings have in turn generated interest from a variety of other fields, including happiness research, law, and health care. Its effect on decision making and well-being is of particular concern to policy- makers and analysts in these fields, although it also has applications in ethics. For example, the tendency to underestimate our ability to adapt to life-changing events has led to legal theorists questioning the assumptions behind tort damage compensation. Behavioral economists have incorporated discrepancies between forecasts and actual emotional outcomes into their models of different types of utility and welfare. This discrepancy also concerns healthcare analysts, in that many important health decisions depend upon patients' perceptions of their future quality of life. Overview Affective forecasting can be divided into four components: predictions about emotional valence (i.e. positive or negative), the specific emotions experienced, their duration, and their intensity. While errors may occur in all four components, research overwhelmingly indicates that the two areas most prone to bias, usually in the form of overestimation, are duration and intensity. Immune neglect is a form of impact bias in response to negative events, in which people fail to predict how much their psychological immune system will hasten their recovery. On average, people are fairly accurate about predicting which emotions they will feel in response to future events. However, some studies indicate that predicting specific emotions in response to more complex social events leads to greater inaccuracy. For example, one study found that while many women who imagine encountering gender harassment predict feelings of anger, in reality, a much higher proportion report feelings of fear. Other research suggests that accuracy in affective forecasting is greater for positive affect than negative affect, suggesting an overall tendency to overreact to perceived negative events. Gilbert and Wilson posit that this is a result of our psychological immune system. While affective forecasts take place in the present moment, researchers also investigate its future outcomes. That is, they analyze forecasting as a two- step process, encompassing a current prediction as well as a future event. Breaking down the present and future stages allow researchers to measure accuracy, as well as tease out how errors occur. Gilbert and Wilson, for example, categorize errors based on which component they affect and when they enter the forecasting process. In the present phase of affective forecasting, forecasters bring to mind a mental representation of the future event and predict how they will respond emotionally to it. The future phase includes the initial emotional response to the onset of the event, as well as subsequent emotional outcomes, for example, the fading of the initial feeling. When errors occur throughout the forecasting process, people are vulnerable to biases. These biases disable people from accurately predicting their future emotions. Errors may arise due to extrinsic factors, such as framing effects, or intrinsic ones, such as cognitive biases or expectation effects. Because accuracy is often measured as the discrepancy between a forecaster's present prediction and the eventual outcome, researchers also study how time affects affective forecasting. For example, the tendency for people to represent distant events differently from close events is captured in the construal level theory. The finding that people are generally inaccurate affective forecasters has been most obviously incorporated into conceptualizations of happiness and its successful pursuit, as well as decision making across disciplines. Findings in affective forecasts have stimulated philosophical and ethical debates, for example, on how to define welfare. On an applied level, findings have informed various approaches to healthcare policy, tort law, consumer decision making, and measuring utility (see below sections on economics, law, and health). Newer and conflicting evidence suggests that intensity bias in affective forecasting may not be as strong as previous research indicates. Five studies, including a meta-analysis recovers evidence that overestimation in affective forecasting is partly due to the methodology of past research. Their results indicate that some participants misinterpreted specific questions in affective forecasting testing. For example, one study found that undergraduate students tended to overestimate experienced happiness levels when participants were asked how they were feeling in general with and without reference to the election, compared to when participants were asked how they were feeling specifically in reference to the election. Findings indicated that 75%-81% of participants asked general questions misinterpreted them. After clarification of tasks, participants were able to more accurately predict the intensity of their emotions  Major sources of errors  Because forecasting errors commonly arise from literature on cognitive processes, many affective forecasting errors derive from and are often framed as cognitive biases, some of which are closely related or overlapping constructs (e.g. projection bias and empathy gap). Below is a list of commonly cited cognitive processes that contribute to forecasting errors. = Major sources of error in emotion = Impact bias One of the most common sources of error in affective forecasting across various populations and situations is the impact bias, the tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of a future event, whether in terms of intensity or duration. The tendencies to overestimate intensity and duration are both robust and reliable errors found in affective forecasting. One study documenting the impact bias examined college students participating in a housing lottery. These students predicted how happy or unhappy they would be one year after being assigned to either a desirable or an undesirable dormitory. These college students predicted that the lottery outcomes would lead to meaningful differences in their own level of happiness, but follow-up questionnaires revealed that students assigned to desirable or undesirable dormitories reported nearly the same levels of happiness. Thus, differences in forecasts overestimated the impact of the housing assignment on future happiness. Some studies specifically address \\"durability bias,\\" the tendency to overestimate the length of time future emotional responses will last. Even if people accurately estimate the intensity of their future emotions, they may not be able to estimate the duration of them. Durability bias is generally stronger in reaction to negative events. This is important because people tend to work toward events they believe will cause lasting happiness, and according to durability bias, people might be working toward the wrong things. The impact bias is a broad term and covers a multitude of more specific errors. Proposed causes of impact bias include mechanisms like immune neglect, focalism, and misconstruals. The pervasiveness of impact bias in affective forecasts is of particular concern to healthcare specialists, in that it affects both patients' expectations of future medical events as well as patient-provider relationships. (See health.)  Expectation effects  Previously formed expectations can alter emotional responses to the event itself, motivating forecasters to confirm or debunk their initial forecasts. In this way, the self-fulfilling prophecy can lead to the perception that forecasters have made accurate predictions. Inaccurate forecasts can also become amplified by expectation effects. For example, a forecaster who expects a movie to be enjoyable will, upon finding it dull, like it significantly less than a forecaster who had no expectations.  Sense-making processes  Major life events can have a huge impact on people's emotions for a very long time but the intensity of that emotion tends to decrease with time, a phenomenon known as emotional evanescence. When making forecasts, forecasters often overlook this phenomenon. Psychologists have suggested that emotion does not decay over time predictably like radioactive isotopes but that the mediating factors are more complex. People have psychological processes that help dampen the emotion. Psychologists have proposed that surprising, unexpected, or unlikely events cause more intense emotional reaction. Research suggests that people are unhappy with randomness and chaos and that they automatically think of ways to make sense of an event when it is surprising or unexpected. This is related to immune neglect in that when these unwanted acts of randomness occur people become upset and try to find meaning or to cope with the event. The way that people try to make sense of the situation can be considered a coping strategy made by the body. This idea differs from immune neglect due to the fact that this is more of momentary idea. Immune neglect tries to cope with the event before it even happens. One study documents how sense-making processes decrease emotional reaction. The study found that a small gift produced greater emotional reactions when it was not accompanied by a reason than when it was, arguably because the reason facilitated the sense- making process, dulling the emotional impact of the gift. Researchers have summarized that pleasant feelings are prolonged after a positive situation if people are uncertain about the situation. People fail to anticipate that they will make sense of events in a way that will diminish the intensity of the emotional reaction. This error is known as ordinization neglect. For example, (\\"I will be ecstatic for many years if my boss agrees to give me a raise\\") an employee might believe, especially if the employee believes the probability of a raise was unlikely. Immediately after having the request approved, the employee may be thrilled but with time the employees make sense of the situation (e.g., \\"I am a very hard worker and my boss must have noticed this\\") thus dampening the emotional reaction. Immune neglect  Gilbert et al. originally coined the term \\"immune neglect\\" (or \\"immune bias\\") to describe a function of the psychological immune system. Immune neglect refers to forecasters' unawareness of their tendency to adapt to and cope with negative events. Unconsciously the body will identify a stressful event and try to cope with the event or try to avoid it. Bolger & Zuckerman found that coping strategies vary between individuals and are influenced by their personalities. They assumed that since people generally do not take their coping strategies into account when they predict future events, that people with better coping strategies should have a bigger impact bias, or a greater difference between their predicted and actual outcome. For example, asking someone who is afraid of clowns how going to a circus would feel may result in an overestimation of fear because the anticipation of such fear causes the body to begin coping with the negative event. Hoerger et al. examined this further by studying college students' emotions for football games. They found that students who generally coped with their emotions instead of avoiding them would have a greater impact bias when predicting how they'd feel if their team lost the game. They found that those with better coping strategies recovered more quickly. Since the participants did not think about their coping strategies when making predictions, those who actually coped had a greater impact bias. Those who avoided their emotions, felt very closely to what they predicted they would. In other words, students who were able to deal with their emotions were able to recover from their feelings. The students were unaware that their body was actually coping with the stress and this process made them feel better than not dealing with the stress. Hoerger ran another study on immune neglect after this, which studied both daters' and non-daters' forecasts about Valentine's Day, and how they would feel in the days that followed. Hoerger found that different coping strategies would cause people to have different emotions in the days following Valentine's Day, but participants' predicted emotions would all be similar. This shows that most people do not realize the impact that coping can have on their feelings following an emotional event. He also found that, not only did immune neglect create a bias for negative events, but also for positive ones. This shows that people continually make inaccurate forecasts because they do not take into account their ability to cope and overcome emotional events. Hoerger proposed that coping styles and cognitive processes are associated with actual emotional reactions to life events. A variant of immune neglect also proposed by Gilbert and Wilson is the region-beta paradox, where recovery from more intense suffering is faster than recovery from less intense experiences because of the engagement of coping systems. This complicates forecasting, leading to errors. Contrarily, accurate affective forecasting can also promote the region-beta paradox. For example, Cameron and Payne conducted a series of studies in order to investigate the relationship between affective forecasting and the collapse of compassion phenomenon, which refers to the tendency for people's compassion to decrease as the number of people in need of help increases. Participants in their experiments read about either 1 or a group of 8 children from Darfur. These researchers found that people who are skilled at regulating their emotions tended to experience less compassion in response to stories about 8 children from Darfur compared to stories about only 1 child. These participants appeared to collapse their compassion by correctly forecasting their future affective states and proactively avoiding the increased negative emotions resulting from the story. In order to further establish the causal role of proactive emotional regulation in this phenomenon, participants in another study read the same materials and were encouraged to either reduce or experience their emotions. Participants instructed to reduce their emotions reported feeling less upset for 8 children than for 1, presumably because of the increased emotional burden and effort required for the former (an example of the region-beta paradox). These studies suggest that in some cases accurate affective forecasting can actually promote unwanted outcomes such as the collapse of compassion phenomenon by way of the region-beta paradox.  Positive vs negative affect  Research suggests that the accuracy of affective forecasting for positive and negative emotions is based on the distance in time of the forecast. Finkenauer, Gallucci, van Dijk, and Pollman discovered that people show greater forecasting accuracy for positive than negative affect when the event or trigger being forecast is more distant in time. Contrarily, people exhibit greater affective forecasting accuracy for negative affect when the event/trigger is closer in time. The accuracy of an affective forecast is also related to how well a person predicts the intensity of his or her emotions. In regard to forecasting about both positive and negative emotions, Levine, Kaplan, Lench, and Safer have recently shown that people can in fact predict the intensity of their feelings about events with a high degree of accuracy. This finding is contrary to much of the affective forecasting literature currently published, which the authors suggest is due to a procedural artifact in how these studies were conducted. Another important affective forecasting bias is fading affect bias, in which the emotions associated with unpleasant memories fade more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events. = Major sources of error in cognition =  Focalism  Focalism (or the \\"focusing illusion\\") occurs when people focus too much on certain details of an event, ignoring other factors. Research suggests that people have a tendency to exaggerate aspects of life when focusing their attention on it. A well-known example originates from a paper by Kahneman and Schkade, who coined the term \\"focusing illusion\\" in 1998. They found that although people tended to believe that someone from the Midwest would be more satisfied if they lived in California, results showed equal levels of life satisfaction in residents of both regions. In this case, concentrating on the easily observed difference in weather bore more weight in predicting satisfaction than other factors. There are many other factors that could have contributed to the desire to move to the Midwest but the focal point for their decisions was weather. Various studies have attempted to \\"defocus\\" participants, meaning instead of focusing on that one factor they tried to make the participants think of other factors or to look at the situation in a different lens. There were mixed results dependent upon methods used. One successful study asked people to imagine how happy a winner of the lottery and a recently diagnosed HIV patient would be. The researchers were able to reduce the amount of focalism by exposing participants to detailed and mundane descriptions of each person's life, meaning that the more information the participants had on the lottery winner and the HIV patient the less they were able to only focus on few factors, these participants subsequently estimated similar levels of happiness for the HIV patient as well as the lottery-winner. As for the control participants, they made unrealistically disparate predictions of happiness. This could be due to the fact that the more information that is available the less likely it is one will able to ignore contributory factors.  Time discounting  Time discounting (or time preference) is the tendency to weigh present events over future events. Immediate gratification is preferred to delayed gratification, especially over longer periods of time and with younger children or adolescents. For example, a child may prefer one piece of candy now instead of five pieces of candy in four months. The longer the duration of time, the more people tend to forget about the future effects. Drawing again from the candy example, even though five pieces of candy are more gratifying than one, the fact that it will take four months to receive such gratification may cause a child to overlook the fact that he/she will be much more satisfied in the future. This pattern is sometimes referred to as hyperbolic discounting or \\"present bias\\" because people's judgements are bias toward present events. Economists often cite time discounting as a source of mispredictions of future utility.  Memory  Affective forecasters often rely on memories of past events. When people report memories for past events they may leave out important details, change things that occurred, and even add things that have not happened. This suggests the mind constructs memories based on what actually happened, and other factors including the person's knowledge, experiences, and existing schemas. Using highly available, but unrepresentative past memories, increases the impact bias. Baseball fans, for example, tend to use the best game they can remember as the basis for their affective forecast of the game they are about to see. Commuters are similarly likely to base their forecasts of how unpleasant it would feel to miss a train on their memory of the worst time they missed the train Various studies indicate that retroactive assessments of past experiences are prone to various errors, such as duration neglect or decay bias. People tend to overemphasize the peaks and ends of their experiences when assessing them (peak/end bias), instead of analyzing the event as a whole. For example, in recalling painful experiences, people place greater emphasis on the most discomforting moments as well as the end of the event, as opposed to taking into account the overall duration. Retroactive reports often conflict with present-moment reports of events, further pointing to contradictions between the actual emotions experienced during an event and the memory of them. In addition to producing errors in forecasts about the future, this discrepancy has incited economists to redefine different types of utility and happiness (see section on economics). Another problem that can arise with affective forecasting is that people tend to remember their past predictions inaccurately. Meyvis, Ratner, and Levav predicted that people forget how they predicted an experience would be beforehand, and thought their predictions were the same as their actual emotions. Because of this, people do not realize that they made a mistake in their predictions, and will then continue to inaccurately forecast similar situations in the future. Meyvis et al. ran five studies to test whether or not this is true. They found in all of their studies, when people were asked to recall their previous predictions they instead write how they currently feel about the situation. This shows that they do not remember how they thought they would feel, and makes it impossible for them to learn from this event for future experiences.  Misconstruals  When predicting future emotional states people must first construct a good representation of the event. If people have a lot of experience with the event then they can easily picture the event. When people do not have much experience with the event they need to create a representation of what the event likely contains. For example, if people were asked how they would feel if they lost one hundred dollars in a bet, gamblers are more likely to easily construct an accurate representation of the event. \\"Construal level theory\\" theorizes that distant events are conceptualized more abstractly than immediate ones. Thus, psychologists suggest that a lack of concrete details prompts forecasters to rely on more general or idealized representations of events, which subsequently leads to simplistic and inaccurate predictions. For example, when asked to imagine what a 'good day' would be like for them in the near future, people often describe both positive and negative events. When asked to imagine what a 'good day' would be like for them in a year, however, people resort to more uniformly positive descriptions. Gilbert and Wilson call bringing to mind a flawed representation of a forecasted event the misconstrual problem. Framing effects, environmental context, and heuristics (such as schemas) can all affect how a forecaster conceptualizes a future event. For example, the way options are framed affects how they are represented: when asked to forecast future levels of happiness based on pictures of dorms they may be assigned to, college students use physical features of the actual buildings to predict their emotions. In this case, the framing of options highlighted visual aspects of future outcomes, which overshadowed more relevant factors to happiness, such as having a friendly roommate. Projection bias Overview Projection bias is the tendency to falsely project current preferences onto a future event. When people are trying to estimate their emotional state in the future they attempt to give an unbiased estimate. However, people's assessments are contaminated by their current emotional state. Thus, it may be difficult for them to predict their emotional state in the future, an occurrence known as mental contamination. For example, if a college student was currently in a negative mood because he just found out he failed a test, and if the college student forecasted how much he would enjoy a party two weeks later, his current negative mood may influence his forecast. In order to make an accurate forecast the student would need to be aware that his forecast is biased due to mental contamination, be motivated to correct the bias, and be able to correct the bias in the right direction and magnitude. Projection bias can arise from empathy gaps (or hot/cold empathy gaps), which occur when the present and future phases of affective forecasting are characterized by different states of physiological arousal, which the forecaster fails to take into account. For example, forecasters in a state of hunger are likely to overestimate how much they will want to eat later, overlooking the effect of their hunger on future preferences. As with projection bias, economists use the visceral motivations that produce empathy gaps to help explain impulsive or self-destructive behaviors, such as smoking. An important affective forecasting bias related to projection bias is personality neglect. Personality neglect refers to a person's tendency to overlook their personality when making decisions about their future emotions. In a study conducted by Quoidbach and Dunn, students' predictions of their feelings about future exam scores were used to measure affective forecasting errors related to personality. They found that college students who predicted their future emotions about their exam scores were unable to relate these emotions to their own dispositional happiness. To further investigate personality neglect, Quoidbach and Dunn studied happiness in relation to neuroticism. People predicted their future feelings about the outcome of the 2008 US presidential election between Barack Obama and John McCain. Neuroticism was correlated with impact bias, which is the overestimation of the length and intensity of emotions. People who rated themselves as higher in neuroticism overestimated their happiness in response to the election of their preferred candidate, suggesting that they failed to relate their dispositional happiness to their future emotional state. The term \\"projection bias\\" was first introduced in the 2003 paper \\"Projection Bias in Predicting Future Utility\\" by Loewenstein, O'Donoghue and Rabin. Market Applications to Projection Bias The novelty of new products oftentimes overexcites consumers and results in the negative consumption externality of impulse buying. To counteract such, Loewenstein recommends offering \\"cooling off\\" Loewenstein, George, Exotic Preferences: Behavioral Economics and Human Motivation, p. 366, Oxford University Press, New York periods for consumers. During such, they would have a few days to reflect about their purchase and appropriately develop a longer-term understanding of the utility they receive from it. This cooling off period could also benefit the production side by diminishing the need for a sales-person to \\"hype\\" certain products. Transparency between consumers and producers would increase as \\"sellers will have an incentive to put buyers in a long-run average mood rather than an overenthusiastic state\\". By implementing Loewentstein's recommendation, firms that understand projection bias should minimize information asymmetry; such would diminish the negative consumer externality that comes from purchasing an undesirable good and relieve sellers from extraneous costs required to exaggerate the utility of their product. The application of this solution extends past a seller's market into other fields like politics. A Rasmussen Study of 2014 found that only 4% of likely U.S. voters believe that politicians keep their campaign promises whereas 83% do not. This distrust in the American political system results in a variety of negative externalities. On the consumer side, voters must sort through an extensive amount of contradictory and false information to develop an informed decision about a candidate. On the production side, \\"the cost of a bid for Congress [has risen] 555% from 1984 to 2012\\".MICHAEL SCHERER, PRATHEEK REBALA, and CHRIS WILSON, \\"The Incredible Rise in Campaign Spending\\", Time, 23 October 2014. Retrieved 4 March 2018 The cost of politics is rising, yet the approval ratings of candidates is falling: Trump's approval ratings have dropped since his election throughout the entire voter base and among his most ardent supporters. The increased amount of information available to voters during the campaigning cycle does not guarantee satisfaction during candidacy. Now, voters are prone to information overload and projection bias during campaigns as they have to sift through a growing amount of negative and overhyped advertisements rather than being presented with facts about political platforms.Matthew P. Motta and Erika Franklin Fowler, \\"The Content and Effect of Political Advertising in U.S. Campaigns\\", December 2016.

The period following where income begins to decline can be explained by retirement. According to Loewenstein's recommendation, a more optimal expenditure and income distribution is displayed in Graph 2. Here, income is left the same as in Graph 1, but expenditures are recalculated by taking the average percentage of expenditures in terms of income from ages 25 to 54 (77.7%) and multiplying such by income to arrive at a theoretical expenditure. The calculation is only applied to this age group because of unpredictable income before 25 and after 54 due to school and retirement. Food waste When buying food, people often wrongly project what they will want to eat in the future when they go shopping, which results in food waste.Holthaus, Eric, \\"Stop Buying in Bulk\\", Slate, 30 June 2015. Retrieved 4 March 2018 = Major sources of error in motivation =  Motivated reasoning  Generally, affect is a potent source of motivation. People are more likely to pursue experiences and achievements that will bring them more pleasure than less pleasure. In some cases, affective forecasting errors appear to be due to forecasters strategic use of their forecasts a means to motivate them to obtain or avoid the forecasted experience. Students, for example, might predict they would devastated if they failed a test as a way to motivate them to study harder for it. The role of motivated reasoning in affective forecasting has been demonstrated in studies by Morewedge and Buechel (2013). Research participants were more likely to overestimate how happy they would be if they won a prize, or achieved a goal, if they made an affective forecast while they could still influence whether or not they achieved it than if they made an affective forecast after the outcome had been determined (while still in the dark about whether they knew if they won the prize or achieved the goal).  In economics  Economists share psychologists' interests in affective forecasting insomuch as it affects the closely related concepts of utility, decision making, and happiness. =Utility= Research in affective forecasting errors complicate conventional interpretations of utility maximization, which presuppose that to make rational decisions, people must be able to make accurate forecasts about future experiences or utility. Whereas economics formerly focused largely on utility in terms of a person's preferences (decision utility), the realization that forecasts are often inaccurate suggests that measuring preferences at a time of choice may be an incomplete concept of utility. Thus, economists such as Daniel Kahneman, have incorporated differences between affective forecasts and later outcomes into corresponding types of utility. Whereas a current forecast reflects expected or predicted utility, the actual outcome of the event reflects experienced utility. Predicted utility is the \\"weighted average of all possible outcomes under certain circumstances.\\" Experienced utility refers to the perceptions of pleasure and pain associated with an outcome. Khaneman and Thaler provide an example of \\"the hungry shopper,\\" in which case the shopper takes pleasure in the purchase of food due to their current state of hunger. The usefulness of such purchasing is based upon their current experience and their anticipated pleasure in fulfilling their hunger. =Decision making= Affective forecasting is an important component of studying human decision making. Research in affective forecasts and economic decision making include investigations of durability bias in consumers and predictions of public transit satisfaction. In relevance to the durability bias in consumers, a study was conducted by Wood and Bettman, that showed that people make decisions regarding the consumption of goods based on the predicted pleasure, and the duration of that pleasure, that the goods will bring them. Overestimation of such pleasure, and its duration, increases the likelihood that the good will be consumed. Knowledge on such an effect can aid in the formation of marketing strategies of consumer goods. Studies regarding the predictions of public transit satisfaction reveal the same bias. However, with a negative impact on consumption, due to their lack of experience with public transportation, car users predict that they will receive less satisfaction with the use of public transportation than they actually experience. This can lead them to refrain from the use of such services, due to inaccurate forecasting. Broadly, the tendencies people have to make biased forecasts deviate from rational models of decision making. Rational models of decision making presume an absence of bias, in favor of making comparisons based on all relevant and available information. Affective forecasting may cause consumers to rely on the feelings associated with consumption rather than the utility of the good itself. One application of affective forecasting research is in economic policy. Knowledge that forecasts, and therefore, decisions, are affected by biases as well as other factors (such as framing effects), can be used to design policies that maximize the utility of people's choices. This approach is not without its critics, however, as it can also be seen to justify economic paternalism. Prospect theory describes how people make decisions. It differs from expected utility theory in that it takes into account the relativity of how people view utility and incorporates loss aversion, or the tendency to react more strongly to losses rather than gains. Some researchers suggest that loss aversion is in itself an affective forecasting error, since people often overestimate the impact of future losses. =Happiness and well-being= Economic definitions of happiness are tied to concepts of welfare and utility, and researchers are often interested in how to increase levels of happiness in the population. The economy has a major influence on the aid that is provided through welfare programs because it provides funding for such programs. Many welfare programs are focused on providing assistance with the attainment of basic necessities such as food and shelter.United States. Congress. House. Committee on Ways and Means. Subcommittee on Human Resources. (2011). GAO report on duplication of government programs; focus on welfare and related programs: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, first session, April 5, 2011 . Washington: U.S. G.P.O.. This is may be due to the fact that happiness and well-being is best derived from personal perceptions of one's ability to provide these necessities. This statement is supported by research that states after basic needs have been met, income has less of an impact on perceptions of happiness. Additionally, the availability of such welfare programs can enable those that are less fortunate to have additional discretionary income. Discretionary income can be dedicated to enjoyable experiences, such as family outings, and in turn, provides an additional dimension to their feelings and experience of happiness. Affective forecasting provides a unique challenge to answering the question regarding the best method for increasing levels of happiness, and economists are split between offering more choices to maximize happiness, versus offering experiences that contain more objective or experienced utility. Experienced utility refers to how useful an experience is in its contribution to feelings of happiness and well-being. Experienced utility can refer to both material purchases and experiential purchases. Studies show that experiential purchases, such as a bag of chips, result in forecasts of higher levels of happiness than material purchases, such as the purchase of a pen. This prediction of happiness as a result of a purchase experience exemplifies affective forecasting. It is possible that an increase in choices, or means, of achieving desired levels of happiness will be predictive of increased levels of happiness. For example, if one is happy with their ability to provide themselves with both a choice of necessities and a choice of enjoyable experiences they are more likely to predict that they will be more happy than if they were forced to choose between one or the other. Also, when people are able to reference multiple experiences that contribute to their feelings of happiness, more opportunities for comparison will lead to a forecast of more happiness. Under these circumstances, both the quantity of choices and the quantity of experienced utility have the same effect on affective forecasting, which makes it difficult to choose a side of the debate on which method is most effective in maximizing happiness. Applying findings from affective forecasting research to happiness also raises methodological issues: should happiness measure the outcome of an experience, or the satisfaction experienced as result of the choice made based upon a forecast? For example, although professors may forecast that getting tenure would significantly increase their happiness, research suggests that in reality, happiness levels between professors who are or are not awarded tenure are insignificant. In this case happiness is measured in terms of the outcome of an experience. Affective forecasting conflicts such as this one have also influenced theories of hedonic adaptation, which compares happiness to a treadmill, in that it remains relatively stable despite our forecasts. In law Similar to how some economists have drawn attention to how affective forecasting violates assumptions of rationality, legal theorists point out that inaccuracies in, and applications of, these forecasts have implications in law that have remained overlooked. The application of affective forecasting, and its related research, to legal theory reflects a wider effort to address how emotions affect the legal system. In addition to influencing legal discourse on emotions, and welfare, Jeremy Blumenthal cites additional implications of affective forecasting in tort damages, capital sentencing and sexual harassment. = Tort damages = Jury awards for tort damages are based on compensating victims for pain, suffering, and loss of quality of life. However, findings in affective forecasting errors have prompted some to suggest that juries are overcompensating victims, since their forecasts overestimate the negative impact of damages on the victims' lives. Some scholars suggest implementing jury education to attenuate potentially inaccurate predictions, drawing upon research that investigates how to decrease inaccurate affective forecasts. = Capital sentencing = During the process of capital sentencing, juries are allowed to hear victim impact statements (VIS) from the victim's family. This demonstrates affective forecasting in that its purpose is to present how the victim's family has been impacted emotionally and, or, how they expect to be impacted in the future. These statements can cause juries to overestimate the emotional harm, causing harsh sentencing, or to underestimate harm, resulting in inadequate sentencing. The time frame in which these statements are present also influences affective forecasting. By increasing the time gap between the crime itself and sentencing (the time at which victim impact statements are given), forecasts are more likely to be influenced by the error of immune neglect (See Immune neglect) Immune neglect is likely to lead to underestimation of future emotional harm, and therefore results in inadequate sentencing. As with tort damages, jury education is a proposed method for alleviating the negative effects of forecasting error. = Sexual harassment = In cases involving sexual harassment, judgements are more likely to blame the victim for their failure to react in a timely fashion or their failure to make use of services that were available to them in the event of sexual harassment. This is because prior to the actual experience of harassment, people tend to overestimate their affective reactions as well as their proactive reactions in response to sexual harassment. This exemplifies the focalism error (See Focalism) in which forecasters ignore alternative factors that may influence ones' reaction, or failure to react. For example, in their study Woodzicka and LaFrance studied women's predictions of how they would react to sexual harassment during an interview. Forecasters overestimated their affective reactions of anger, while underestimating the level of fear they would experience. They also overestimated their proactive reactions. In Study 1, participants reported that they would refuse to answer questions of a sexual nature and, or, report the question to the interviewer's supervisor. However, in Study 2, of those who had actually experienced sexual harassment during an interview, none of them displayed either proactive reaction. If juries are able to recognize such errors in forecasting, they may be able to adjust such errors. Additionally, if juries are educated on other factors that may influence the reactions of those who are victims of sexual harassment, such as intimidation, they are more likely to make more accurate forecasts, and less likely to blame victims for their own victimization.  In health  Affective forecasting has implications in health decision making and medical ethics and policy. Research in health-related affective forecasting suggests that nonpatients consistently underestimate the quality of life associated with chronic health conditions and disability. The so-called \\"disability paradox\\" states the discrepancy between self-reported levels of happiness amongst chronically ill people versus the predictions of their happiness levels by healthy people. The implications of this forecasting error in medical decision making can be severe, because judgments about future quality of life often inform health decisions. Inaccurate forecasts can lead patients, or more commonly their health care agent, to refuse life-saving treatment in cases when the treatment would involve a drastic change in lifestyle, for example, the amputation of a leg. A patient, or health care agent, who falls victim to focalism would fail to take into account all the aspects of life that would remain the same after losing a limb. Although Halpern and Arnold suggest interventions to foster awareness of forecasting errors and improve medical decision making amongst patients, the lack of direct research in the impact of biases in medical decisions provides a significant challenge. Research also indicates that affective forecasts about future quality of life are influenced by the forecaster's current state of health. Whereas healthy individuals associate future low health with low quality of life, less healthy individuals do not forecast necessarily low quality of life when imagining having poorer health. Thus, patient forecasts and preferences about their own quality of life may conflict with public notions. Because a primary goal of healthcare is maximizing quality of life, knowledge about patients' forecasts can potentially inform policy on how resources are allocated. Some doctors suggest that research findings in affective forecasting errors merit medical paternalism. Others argue that although biases exist and should support changes in doctor-patient communication, they do not unilaterally diminish decision-making capacity and should not be used to endorse paternalistic policies. This debate captures the tension between medicine's emphasis on protecting the autonomy of the patient and an approach that favors intervention in order to correct biases.  Improving forecasts  Individuals who recently have experienced an emotionally charged life event will display the impact bias. The individual predicts they will feel happier than they actually feel about the event. Another factor that influences overestimation is focalism which causes individuals to concentrate on the current event. Individuals often fail to realize that other events will also influence how they currently feel. Lam et al. (2005) found that the perspective that individuals take influences their susceptibility to biases when making predictions about their feelings. A perspective that overrides impact bias is mindfulness. Mindfulness is a skill that individuals can learn to help them prevent overestimating their feelings. Being mindful helps the individual understand that they may currently feel negative emotions, but the feelings are not permanent. The Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) can be used to measure an individual's mindfulness. The five factors of mindfulness are observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. The two most important factors for improving forecasts are observing and acting with awareness. The observing factor assesses how often an individual attends to their sensations, emotions, and outside environment. The ability to observe allows the individual to avoid focusing on one single event, and be aware that other experiences will influence their current emotions. Acting with awareness requires assessing how individuals tend to current activities with careful consideration and concentration. Emanuel, Updegraff, Kalmbach, and Ciesla (2010) stated that the ability to act with awareness reduces the impact bias because the individual is more aware that other events co-occur with the present event. Being able to observe the current event can help individuals focus on pursuing future events that provide long-term satisfaction and fulfillment.

In fact they were in all probability not designed as a group. Despite their ruined state, the remains have good decorative carving and their semi-wooded setting is attractive and peaceful.Ancient Angkor guide book by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, p.117, published in 2003. The site The temples are located in Angkor Thom, north-east of the Bayon, in front of Tep Pranam. The temples are near but they weren't built in the same period, except for two of them, so there is no apparent order. They're identified by letters: T, U, V, W and X. \\"X\\" is a Buddhist temple, it remained unfinished and is probably the latest. The others are Hindu. The five temples are in bad conditions, upper levels are ruined, but their carvings are interesting and the site is rather peaceful, wooded and scarcely crowded. A moat, often dry,Freeman, Jacques, 2006, p.118 surrounds some of the temples. They were cleaned first by Jean Commaille in 1908, then by Henri Marchal from 1918 to 1920.Glaize, 1993, p.125 =Temples \\"T\\" and \\"U\\"= They were built together quite for sure, as they are on the same W-E axis and are surrounded by a single moat. They're oriented to the west, having a cruciform terrace on two levels with nƒÅgas balustrades as entrance. The temple \\"T\\" has a sandstone enclosure, which measures 45 by 40 meters, and has two gopuras on the main W-E axis. The sanctuary, on a 3-levels ornated platform 6 meters high, has a chamber which sheltered a large linga on its pedestal. The fragments of the lintel of western door, on the ground, show a stylized depiction of the \\"Churning of the Sea of Milk\\", while the walls are decorated with devatas and floral motifs, Bayon style. The temple \\"U\\" is similar to \\"T\\", but smaller and simpler. Its enclosure is 35 by 28 meters. It has no gopura. The lintel of west door shows the Trimurti, with Shiva dancing on a kala-head between Vishnu and Brahma. The internal walls are sculpted with dvarapalas and the blind arches at the base of pillars are typical of Angkor Wat period. On the northern lintel there is another depiction of the \\"Churning of the Sea of Milk\\". =Temple \\"X\\"= Temple \\"X\\" stands on a large terrace, 4 meters high, about 100 meters east of temple \\"U\\". It is straight reachable from there if the moat is dry. It is similar in design to the former temples but is larger and incomplete in its decorations. \\"X\\" is a buddhist temple: on the walls of the sanctuary chamber there is a double row of sculpted Buddhas. Even the lintels show buddhist motifs. However the most interesting remains, depicting famous Siddharta's cutting of the hair, are not in place. Towards the east, the laterite terrace is surrounded by semas,a sema is a boundary stone, carved with figurative Buddhas delimiting the sacred area. =Temple \\"V\\"= Outside the residual moat, north of temple \\"U\\", there is temple \\"V\\". It is oriented to the East, where it opens with a double vestibule, and has no enclosure. On the West it has a causeway which ends with a 40 meter long cruciform terrace, leading into NE corner of the Royal Square. Its sanctuary chamber, standing on two-tier sculpted basement, is the largest of the group, having a square side of 3.80 m, and hosting a large 1.5 m linga. Its external decorations, in Angkor Wat style, are incomplete. =Temple \\"Y\\"= Temple \\"Y\\" has no basement or stairways and stands on an earthen platform, north of \\"V\\". It was dated between Angkor Wat and Bayon. Oriented to the East, it has a long mandapa as entrance, linked by a vestibule to a 3.5 m by 3.0 m sanctuary chamber, which hosted a linga 0.95 m tall. The larger chamber has mostly collapsed, but on its western side there are two remarkable half-frontons, which depict the defeat of the asura Bana by Krishna to the north and the three giant steps of Vamana to the south.Glaize, 1993, p.128  Gallery  File:Preah Pithu29.JPGWestern closure temple \\"Y\\" File:Preah Pithu34.JPGTemple \\"V\\" File:Preah Pithu25.JPGDouble row of sculpted Buddhas in sanctuary chamber of temple \\"X\\" File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpgAdolescent monks at temple U File:Preah Pithu T glimpse.jpgGlimpse of Temple T - Preah Pithu See also *Architecture of Cambodia Notes References * * External links *Preah Pithu - temple T on CISARK *Preah Pithu - temple U on CISARK *Preah Pithu - temple X on CISARK *Preah Pithu - temple V on CISARK *Preah Pithu - temple Y on CISARK *Reportage and photos of Preah Pithu from Andy Brouwer's blog Category:Angkorian sites in Siem Reap Province ","title":"Preah Pithu"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",R]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/35.md","filePath":"glossary/35.md"}'),D={name:"glossary/35.md"},L=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{x as __pageData,L as default};
