It is the only station on the system that has closed permanently. The station opened in 1896. It was located 25 metres to the south-west of its replacement, Partick station and about 300 metres to the south of Partickhill railway station. It closed permanently in 1977 when the rest of the network was closed for modernisation. The modernisation had been announced in 1974 by the subway's then operators, the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive (GGPTE). Although converted to electric traction in 1935 the systems infrastructure and rolling stock was virtually unchanged from its opening in 1896, and improvement to the subway was seen by the GGPTE as an essential part of plans to eliminate transport bottlenecks in the city. As part of the process, which began in 1977, all 15 stations were to be rebuilt. However it was planned to link the subway to the national rail network's newly reopened Argyle Line at Partick via an interchange station. This meant permanently closing Merkland Street and opening a new station a short distance away. Thus, when the network reopened in 1980, it was replaced by a new station nearby named Partick, offering direct transfers to the rail station of the same name. There is evidence of Merkland Street station's existence due to a long straight and humped stretch on the underground with large diameter tunnels, although the platforms and station buildings no longer remain. On 18 September 1940, during World War II, a German bomb, which dropped during a night raid on Glasgow and may have been intended for nearby naval facilities, landed on a bowling green to the south of the station. The explosion this caused resulted in damage to both tunnels and closure of this part of the system until repairs were completed in January 1941.

As of 31 December 2018, it had a population of 2,097 and an area of .All demographics and other statistics: Italian statistical institute Istat. Pagazzano borders the following municipalities: Bariano, Brignano Gera d'Adda, Caravaggio, Morengo.  Name origin  There is no certainty on the name's etymology. Some claim it is a derivation of pagus and anus which means \\"ancient village\\", whilst others believe it derives from the name of a Roman landowner, Pacatius. Pagazzano is mentioned in the edict for the compartment of the State of Milan of 10 June 1757, among the municipalities of the Pieve di Gera d'Adda.  History  Throughout the Middle Ages Pagazzano maintained its characteristics of a small agricultural village with limited strategic-military appeal, despite its central position along the axis of Crema-Bergamo. A fortification was built in the sixth century, according to some, or in the tenth, according to others, to defend against the raids of the Hungarians. In the eleventh century Pagazzano already gravitated in the Milanese political and military orbit to find itself in 1300 in the possession of the Viscounts who built a castle here between 1450 and 1475. Pagazzano and specifically its castle were the object of interest in the age-old opposition between the Visconti-Sforza and the Serenissima (Republic of Venice), passing repeatedly from one state to another, without however improving the socio-economic conditions of the inhabitants of the village. The controversial issue related to the border between the two powers was defined with the construction of the Bergamasque ditch, a channel that also bordered the territory of Pagazzano, delimiting it to the east and relegating it definitively under the influence of Milan. With the fall of the Sforza dynasty, Pagazzano entered, together with Milan, into the sphere of influence of the French until, in 1559, it passed under the Spanish. The Spanish period was the hardest for the community of Pagazzano, which - beyond the misgovernment of the new rulers - had to suffer abuses and robberies that blocked the economic and demographic development, possibly contributing to its regression. With the passage under Austrian domination in 1700, there was a significant improvement in the living conditions of the community, followed by a demographic increase and a general improvement in living conditions. After the Napoleonic period, Pagazzano returned, with the Congress of Vienna in 1818, under the Austrian domination. The improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the community during the Austrian period allowed the demographic development that had come to a halt as well as an increase in agricultural production. The development of Pagazzano increased after 1861 with the unification of Italy, however, a predominantly agricultural economy remained dominant.  Town  Pagazzano's historical center has maintained the same urban landscape that it had in the Middle Age.  Demographics  The age range from 36 to 53 years is the largest part of the municipal population, counting for 28.5% of the total, followed by the band 18 ‚Äì 35 years old, which counts 25.1% of the residents. The industrial development of recent years and the intense building activity, have led to an increase of the inhabitants: comparing the increase in residents with the decrease in the birth rate shows that the increase in population is due to the positive net migration, mainly because of the foreign nationals immigration. The statistical data on immigration in the municipality showed a preponderance of African immigrants than those from Asian countries and EU citizens. In total the foreign population makes up around 5% of the population.

Playing career A native of Glasgow, McCartney began as a full back with Cartvale at the age of 18, later playing for Thistle. In 1887 he joined Rangers, staying for two years. before joining Cowlairs. In 1893, he joined Newton Heath, playing 19 league games and scoring once before joining Luton Town in 1894. He helped Luton gain election to the Football League and played in Luton's first-ever league match on 4 September 1897, a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Leicester Fosse. He played 27 times that season, leaving at the end of it to join Barnsley. He scored 3 times in 63 league games for Barnsley before retiring in April 1901 to become Barnsley's secretary-manager. Managerial career He left Barnsley in mid-1904 and returned to Scotland to manage St Mirren. He guided the Buddies to the 1908 Scottish Cup Final, losing 5‚Äì1 to Celtic. In 1910 he left St Mirren to take over as manager of Heart of Midlothian. His spell in Edinburgh encompassed the club's rise to the top of the Scottish League with a group of exciting young players he brought in, and the decimation of that team after they enlisted together to fight in World War One, with several killed and others wounded. The closest he came to silverware was in the 1919 Victory Cup where Hearts were defeated in the final by his old club St Mirren. McCartney resigned from his position in October 1919, and was succeeded as Hearts manager by his son Willie. In May 1920, he was appointed manager of Portsmouth. He guided Portsmouth from Division Three South to the First Division, but resigned due to ill health in May 1927 before he could manage Pompey in the top flight. In September 1927 he returned to management with Luton Town, but with his health declining further, he resigned in December 1929 and retired from football. McCartney authored two booklets documenting Scottish footballers in the Great War and those from Hearts who perished.  Personal life  McCartney's younger brother Dave also became a footballer. He died in Edinburgh at the age of 66.

Early life Ross emigrated to Upper Canada, present day (Ontario), from Scotland about 1805. Pacific Fur Company In 1811, while working for John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company, Ross took part in the founding of Fort Astoria, a fur-trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. During the same year he led a detachment up the Columbia River and founded Fort Okanogan where during the winter he was the sole PFC employee at the trading post.Ross, Alexander. Adventures of the first settlers on the Oregon or Columbia River. London: Smith, Elder and Co. 1849, pp. 145-147. During his solitary posting, Ross' hair greyed from the stress of being socially isolated among the welcoming Syilx people, \\"savages who had never seen a white man before.\\" Nights were a constant source of worry for the lonely Ross, despite having several hundred Syilxs encamped near by performing sentry duties. One evening his watchdog alerted Ross to an intruder. > In this perplexing dilemma I got my hand, with as little noise as possible, > I got my hand, with my gun, and gradually drawing out the ramrod, tried, > with my right arm streched out, to stir up the embers, so that I might > see... I concluded that the enemy must be skulking in the cellar... when, > lo! What was there but a skunk sitting on a roll of tobacco! The shot blew > it almost to atoms, and so delicately perfumed everything in the house that > I was scarcely able to live in it for days afterwards... North West Company Ross joined the North West Company in 1813, after they acquired all of the Pacific Fur Company properties, renaming Fort Astoria to Fort George. Ross and three Indians crossed the North Cascades on a project of discovery in 1814. Ross's account is vague but they probably crossed the mountains via Cascade Pass. In 1818 Ross acted as scribe for a trading party from the North West Company who traveled within sight of the Teton Range in modern Wyoming. He and trapper Daniel Potts apparently viewed some of the thermal features of what is today Yellowstone National Park. Each of them produced an account of these features, with Ross reporting that \\"...boiling fountain having different degrees of temperature were very numerous; one or two were so very hot as to boil meat.\\"(Breining, p. 69) Ross described the lower Columbia River area of the Pacific Northwest as follows: > The banks of the river throughout are low and skirted in the distance by a > chain of moderately high lands on each side, interspersed here and there > with clumps of wide spreading oaks, groves of pine, and a variety of other > kinds of woods. Between these high lands lie what is called the valley of > the Wallamitte , the frequented haunts of innumerable herds of elk and > deer.... . In ascending the river the surrounding country is most > delightful, and the first barrier to be meet with is about forty miles up > from its mouth . Here the navigation is interrupted by a ledge of rocks, > running across the river from side to side in the form of an irregular > horseshoe, over which the whole body of water falls at one leap down a > precipice of about forty feet, called the Falls. Fort Nez Perc√©s was established by the North West Company in 1818 under the direction traders Ross and Donald MacKenzie. Located on the east bank of the Columbia River, the station was half a mile north of the mouth of the Walla Walla River and a few miles below the mouth of the Snake River. The site was first claimed and posted by David Thompson several years prior. Hudson's Bay Company The North West Company was merged with the Hudson's Bay Company by the British government in 1821. The majority of the NWC employees, including Ross, continued laboring at their respective locations for the HBC. Ross served another four years as factor at Fort Nez Perc√©s after the merger. While working for the HBC, Ross explored various territories of the Pacific Northwest. In 1824, while searching the mountain wilderness of what is present day Idaho, known to them as Columbia District, for beaver, Ross came up the Wood River and discovered Galena Summit on September 18. Leading a large brigade of Hudson's Bay Company trappers, he wondered if he could get through unknown mountains and rocky defiles that obstructed his passage back to his base of operations at present Challis. Unwilling to turn back he pressed on to explore Stanley Basin and the difficult canyon beyond. When he reached Challis on October 5, 1824, he had traveled the route now followed by Idaho State Highway 75 from Bellevue to Salmon through mostly unexplored land. Later years Ross subsequently moved to the Red River Colony, present-day Manitoba, where he served as Sheriff, Post master, and a member of the council. His daughter Mary married George Flett on 26 November 1840. Flett was later to become a prominent Presbyterian missionary. Ross published a number of books including the notable The Red River Settlement. Legacy Ross House is a small museum that highlights the life of Alexander Ross and his family. It is located in the Point Douglas area of Winnipeg.

He is best known as one of 19th century America's master covered bridge builders. Chenoweth and his brother Eli constructed 20 bridges during the 1840s and '50s, most of them covered, on four western Virginia turnpikes, notably on the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike system in what is now West Virginia. Biography Philippi Covered Bridge (1852) Chenoweth was born, lived and died in Randolph County, Virginia (later West Virginia). In his youth, Chenoweth built churches, houses, sideboards, poster beds, buggies, wagons, a model of a reverse-cutting sawmill, and even made dominoes. Chenoweth became an associate of Claudius Crozet (1789‚Äì1864), a noted French- born civil engineer who oversaw the design and construction of Virginia's transportation infrastructure of turnpikes, canals, and roads with funding by the Virginia Board of Public Works and the General Assembly of Virginia prior to the American Civil War (1861-1865). He was also strongly influenced by the bridge framing system developed in 1817 by Theodore Burr (1771‚Äì1822) ‚Äî the Burr arch-truss structural design ‚Äî which improved bridge strength dramatically. Chenoweth's best-known surviving bridge is the Philippi Covered Bridge (1852) spanning the Tygart Valley River and carrying U.S. Route 250 in Philippi. It is an outstanding example of a modified Burr truss bridge with two spans totaling . It is also the only covered bridge in the United States currently incorporated into the national primary highway system, although it has been extensively reinforced and reconstructed. The only other Chenoweth covered bridge to survive to the present day is located at Barrackville in Marion County. Several homes and the Huttonsville Presbyterian Church in Huttonsville are also among Chenoweth's extant creations. Chenoweth was buried in the Beverly Cemetery.

Providing training in multiple forms and practices of theatre, it is one of the highest-regarded conservatory schools for drama in the country. The school was founded in 1976 as an affiliate of George Brown College, which is also based in Toronto. The George Brown Theatre School is often cited as one of the best theatre schools in Canada. It is known for training actors and theatre artists who graduate with varied experience from many instructors, guest teachers, and guest directors. Furthermore, it has earned a national reputation for the high-calibre work of its graduates, many of whom have earned accolades and built successful careers in theatre, film, television, and other entertainment industries. History George Brown College began offering several theatre arts courses in theatre, music, and dance in 1973 as part-time electives for its general student populous. In an effort to bring more cohesion to the College's performing arts division, Dean of Academic Studies Bradley Webb, along with the artistic leadership of veteran actor and director Joseph Shaw, founded the George Brown Theatre School in 1976. The school began classes in September 1976 as a two-year, 20-student program housed at the College's Kensington Campus with a focus on both theatre performance and production. It moved and expanded in the following year with the acquisition of a performance space at 530 King Street East while training continued at the College's Casa Loma campus. Upon Shaw's retirement in 1986, Heinar Piller became Artistic Director of the school. Piller engaged Peter C. Wylde as Head of Acting and under their leadership, the program was expanded from two to three years. The curriculum was redesigned with a focus on classical text and expanded performance elements to showcase its graduating students, including the addition of a children's theatre show performed by second-year students. Following Piller's retirement in 1997, Paul Lampert served as Artistic Director of the school for three years. During this time, the school expanded its training by launching the one-year Introduction to Performing Arts Careers (IPAC) program. James Simon took over as Artistic Director in 2000. In December of that year, Paul Carder, the College's then Dean of Business and Creative Arts, approached Albert Schultz, then Artistic Director of the Soulpepper Theatre Company, about creating a formal partnership between the company and the George Brown Theatre School. This eventually led to the creation of the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, a professional performance facility located in Toronto's Distillery District where both the school and Soulpepper are now located. Classes officially began at the Young Centre on September 6, 2005. In January 2018, the Toronto Star, CBC and the Dialog published articles describing bullying, discrimination, harassment, and abuse perpetrated by a George Brown Theatre School faculty member against students. The incidents reported by former students were said to have taken place between 2000 and 2015. According to the articles, allegations of abuse were reported to the George Brown College and George Brown Theatre School administrations by former students in 2007 and as early as 2000. Additional reports of abuse emerged in 2017, resulting in the leave of absence of acting professor Todd Hammond, who was primarily cited in allegations by former students. However, Hammond has been paid by the College as recently as 2019, despite not being listed in the theatre school's 2018-2019 faculty. The school has since undergone several changes in response to the publications, namely the hiring of new acting professors, changes in faculty, and the succession of Sue Miner as Program Coordinator after James Simon. Location Cherry Street. In November 2001, the Distillery Historic District Project was announced as a new Toronto attraction. The partnership of the George Brown Theatre School and Soulpepper immediately began negotiations with the Cityscape Development group to take possession of Tank Houses 9 and 10, creating what became the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. The vision of this partnership was to create a performing arts, education and community outreach facility and home to the school, Soulpepper, and Toronto‚Äôs independent arts community. =Young Centre for the Performing Arts= In 2002, the architectural firm of Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects was hired to design the centre with Thomas Payne as the principal architect. The design offered three professional theatres, four rehearsal studios, two classrooms, a costume shop, a student lounge, artist garden, public lobby, cafe, and administration offices for the theatre school and Soulpepper. George Brown and Soulpepper each raised half of the $14 million cost in addition to a $3 million gift from the Michael Young Family Foundation in 2003 which secured funding for its development. The George Brown Theatre School, which operates in a 9080 ft2 area of the building, began classes at the partially-completed centre in September 2005 prior to the Young Centre's official opening on January 15, 2006. = Theatres = The theatre school regularly performs in three theatres in the Young Centre. The Marilyn and Charles Baillie Theatre, the largest of the three, is a flexible space that seats up to 378 patrons and is host to the second-year children's show. The graduating class' season, meanwhile, alternates between the Michael Young Theatre, which seats a maximum of 269 patrons, and the black box Tank House Theatre, which has a capacity of 110.  Admissions and graduation rates  = Admissions = The George Brown Theatre School is a highly competitive program which only accepts 30 to 32 students each year into its three-year advanced diploma program out of 650 to 700 applicants. Admission is based predominantly on the success of a 3-stage audition process: an initial first round of performance auditions ‚Äî in which candidates are requested to perform a contemporary monologue, a classical monologue, and an a cappella song ‚Äî a second round of callback auditions, and a third round of interviews. Auditions are held in-person in April and May of each year in Toronto, as well as via Skype if necessary for candidates unable to travel for the audition. = Graduation rates = Although up to 32 students are admitted into the school in first year, a typical graduating class has about 14 to 19 students. Similarly, a typical second-year cohort has, on average, 19 students. However, in 2017, 23 students graduated ‚Äî one of the largest classes in recent history.  Curriculum  The George Brown Theatre School is a conservatory-based institution. Its primary curriculum is built on a classical approach to acting through voice, movement, speech, dance, and music classes, which students are required to take throughout the entire three-year advanced diploma program. Students learn a wide range of acting styles through these classes as well as through other required courses including stage combat, improvisation, neutral mask, character mask, clowning, commedia dell'arte, storytelling, film and television technique, and various classical and contemporary scene studies. In addition to this, students take courses in text analysis, contact improvisation, dialectology, audition technique, theatre history, the business of acting, and the Alexander technique. The program is intensive, sometimes requiring students to train for upwards of 11 hours on a single day. Students also participate in five full- scale productions throughout their three years of training. Third-year students work with professional directors, stage managers, designers, and technicians to produce a full season of plays performed at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. Additionally, second-year students devise and present a children's theatre show each November and December based on the stories of children‚Äôs author Robert Munsch. In addition to training and performances, the school provides a mentorship program in which third-year students are individually paired with a successful theatre practitioner who mentors each student for a year after graduation. Third-year students are also offered three-week-long workshops in motion capture and voice-over work at the school. Beyond its three-year program, the George Brown Theatre School offers a one- year certificate program known as the Preparation Program (formerly the Introduction to Performing Arts Careers program). This program is designed for students wishing to obtain basic skills needed to enter into theatre schools or the entertainment business. Graduates of the preparation program often successfully audition into the school's three-year performance program.

Fraser (born 1955) is an American genome scientist and microbiologist who has worked in microbial genomics and genome medicine. Her research has contributed to the understanding of the diversity and evolution of microbial life. Fraser is the director of the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD, where she holds the Dean's Endowed Professorship in the School of Medicine. She has joint faculty appointments at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the Departments of Medicine and Microbiology/Immunology. In 2019, she began serving a one-year term as President-Elect for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), which will be followed by a one-year term as AAAS president starting in February 2020 and a one-year term as chair of the Board of Directors in February 2021. Early life Fraser was raised by a high school principal and an elementary school teacher in Saugus, MA a suburb of Boston, MA. She performed well at school and was always interested in learning. She became interested in science after being taught biology in high school. At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), during her senior year, she performed independent research in a research lab. Education Fraser received her B.S. degree in Biology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1977 and her Ph.D. degree in Pharmacology at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1981 with a thesis entitled \\"Autoantibodies and monoclonal antibodies to ‚Ñìgb‚Ñìs-adrenergic receptors : their role in receptor characterization and human physiology\\". Career Fraser has authored more than 300 publications with more than 50,000 citations, edited four books, and served on the editorial boards of nine scientific journals. She is included on 23 issued patents and 19 published patents =Genomics= From 1998 to 2007, Fraser was president and director of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in Rockville, MD, and led the teams that sequenced the genomes of bacterial and parasitic pathogens and the first model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. In 1995, Fraser was part of the team to first sequence the complete genome of a free-living organism‚ÄîHaemophilus influenzae‚Äîthe bacterium that causes lower respiratory tract infections and meningitis in infants and young children. In 2007, Fraser joined the University of Maryland School of Medicine as director of the new Institute for Genome Sciences. Fraser's work on the 2001 Amerithrax investigation led to the identification of four genetic mutations in the anthrax spores that enabled the FBI to trace the material back to its original source. This effort catalyzed the development of the field of microbial forensics. She is an expert in microbial forensics and the growing concern about dual uses ‚Äì research that can provide knowledge and technologies that could be misapplied. Fraser has led NIAID-funded efforts in the genomics of infectious disease, including the current iteration of the Genome Centers for Infectious Disease. Past and current studies funded through these initiatives aim to explore the dynamic interactions between high-priority pathogens, hosts, their microbiota, the immune system, and the environment, with the goal to provide a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of infectious disease with hypothesis-driven research using high-throughput \\"-omics\\" technologies. These projects both stimulate and enhance ongoing technology development in technology and data cores. Fraser's current research is part of the Human Microbiome Project and is focused on how the structure and function of microbial communities in the human gastrointestinal tract change in association with diseases such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease, and how these communities respond to interventions including oral vaccination and probiotics administration. =Advisory panels and editorial boards= In 2019, Fraser is serving a one-year term as President-Elect for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), which will be followed by a one-year term as AAAS president starting in February 2020 and a one-year term as chair of the Board of Directors in February 2021. In accepting the nomination to be a candidate for AAAS President, Fraser expressed a desire to use this position to be an ardent spokesperson for science and to promote application of the scientific method to the solution of our most pressing problems, including climate change, antimicrobial resistance as well as food security, water security, and energy security. She notes that \\"our ability to respond to these challenges has been hampered to a considerable extent by a lack of adequate funding, a tendency to fund 'safer' research projects, and a relative lack of public trust in science.\\". Fraser has been an editor for journals mBio, Journal of Bacteriology, Microbial Genomics (journal), Molecular Case Studies, and DNA and Cell Biology. Since 2006, Fraser has also served as a member of the Board of Directors of Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD), a Fortune 500 medical technology company.

Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi in 1925 in Practical Idealism predicted: \\"The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.\\"Praktischer Idealismus, Wien/Leipzig 1925, pages 20, 23, 50 The same scenario had been envisaged, with rather less enthusiasm, by Madison Grant in his 1916 The Passing of the Great Race, calling for a eugenics program to prevent this development, and in a similar ideological context in Lothrop Stoddard's The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy in 1920. History Gottfried de Purucker was an author and theosophist who, when asked about intermarriage in 1930, said: The word miscegenation was used in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet printed in New York City in late 1863, entitled Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro. The pamphlet purported to be in favor of interbreeding of whites and blacks until the races were indistinguishably mixed as mulattos, claiming that this was the goal of the United States Republican Party. The real authors were David Goodman Croly, managing editor of the New York World, a Democratic Party paper, and George Wakeman, a World reporter. The pamphlet soon was exposed as an attempt to discredit the Republicans, the Lincoln administration, and the abolitionist movement by exploiting the fears and racial biases common among whites. Nonetheless, this pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in communities on both sides of the American Civil War by opponents of Republicans. The British colony of Maryland was the first to pass an anti-miscegenation law (1664). In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, many American states passed anti- miscegenation laws, often based on controversial interpretations of the Bible, particularly the story of Phinehas. Typically a felony, these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of adultery or fornication would be brought against them instead. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii, and the federal District of Columbia did not pass anti-miscegenation laws. In 1883, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Pace v. Alabama. In 1948, the California Supreme Court in Perez v. Sharp effectively repealed the California anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby making California the first state in the twentieth century to do so. In 1967, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia.

Billy Nicholls was originally hired by Andrew Loog Oldham as a staff writer for Oldham's Immediate Records. Oldham was so entranced by the Beach Boys' 1966 album, Pet Sounds that he enlisted songwriter Billy Nicholls to record a British response, which became this largely forgotten album. The Small Faces' Steve Marriott can be heard very prominently on \\"Would You Believe?,\\" despite Oldham's attempts to drown him out with heavy orchestration. Oldham wanted this to be the British Pet Sounds but financial difficulties with the label caused it to be shelved (it only achieved an initial promotional run of 100 copies, as Immediate IMCP009) before it ever hit the streets. In 1998, Nicholls re-released it on his own label Southwest Records. It was made more widely available on Sequel Castle Communications (CMQDD1358) records in 1999. Several Sequel/Castle editions have been released since, including a version containing demos from the 60s, also originally first released as Snapshot on Southwest Records in 2000. Other artists recorded versions of Billy Nicholls' songs from Would You Believe. Like Nicholls, Andrew Loog Oldham also produced the 1967 Del Shannon LP Home and Away. This LP was also unissued at the time. It has been reissued in multiple formats since 1978, first called And The Music Plays On and later as Home and Away on CD.

Jean-Joseph Marie Carri√®s (February 15, 1855 ‚Äì July 1, 1894) was a French sculptor, ceramist, and miniaturist. His ceramic work is mostly in stoneware, and part of the French art pottery movement, and includes many faces and heads, often with grotesque expressions, but he made several conventional pots, often with thick unctuous ash glaze effects in the Japanese style.Sullivan, Elizabeth, \\"French Art Pottery\\", In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2014, online Biography Born in Lyon, Carri√®s was orphaned at age six and was raised in a Roman Catholic orphanage. He apprenticed with a local sculptor then in 1874 moved to Paris to study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts under Augustin-Alexandre Dumont. He first showed at the Paris Salon of 1875 and gained considerable recognition for his sculpted busts at the Paris Salons of 1879 and 1881. However, after seeing an exhibition of Japanese works at the 1878 World's Fair in Paris, he began to devote himself to the creation of polychrome Horror Masks. Jean-Joseph Carri√®s was a friend of John Singer Sargent who painted his portrait in 1880. His works exhibited at the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1892 were widely acclaimed and were acquired by the French Ministry of Culture and by a museum in Hamburg, Germany. That year, the government of France made him a member of the Legion of Honor. In 1894, a year after he had sculpted perhaps his most famous work entitled Faune, Jean-Joseph Carri√®s died of pleurisy at the age of thirty-nine. He is buried at Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 4,657 and an area of .All demographics and other statistics: Italian statistical institute Istat. The municipality borders with Mapello on the north, Bonate Sopra to its south-west, and Ponte San Pietro on the east.  Geography  The surface of Presezzo comune covers a mostly flat area of in the central-western sector of the province of Bergamo, in the so-called Isola Brembana. The core of the town is located at an elevation of , on the two sides of the modest Lesina torrent; the eastern part of the territory, known as Ghiaie di Presezzo, lies below the main part of the town, the ground lowering toward the banks of Brembo River. The Lesina torrent crosses the town from north to south before flowing into the Brembo River. Its flow is narrow all over the year, primarily because waters are diverted upstream to feed industrial facilities and civil usage, and the general global warming concurred in a growing decrease of the average flow of the torrent in last years. Nevertheless, the torrent capacity can quickly grow after copious rainfalls, specifically after late-summer cloudbursts. The unexpected spates of the Lesina caused several floodings in the past decades, resulting in damages to private and public properties; the municipal administration had thereafter renovated the embankments in the early 2000s, thus avoiding further floodings. The actual geomorphology of the area is chiefly due to the perpetual deposit of debris and material by the Brembo River and its tributaries descending from the Prealps located few kilometers to the north. The soil is thus of alluvial origin, mostly made up of gravel and grit in the proximity of Brembo River, clayey in the southerner part of the territory beyond Lesina torrent, rich in humus in the remaining territory.Comune di Presezzo . The terrain is suitable for an agricultural exploitation, and for centuries provided subsistence to Presezzo inhabitants; nowadays, only a few part of the territory is still cultivated, most of the land being destined for urbanization.  History  In the religious field, the parish church of San Fermo and Rustico is very important. Built in 1875 in place of a previous cult building, it presents numerous works dedicated to the two patron saints taken from the previous parish church. The church has an organ modified by the Serassi brothers around 1801. The organ was completely restored in 1984. [7]. The churchyard has recently been re-structured, paved and adorned with two olive trees Other important buildings are the Palazzo Furietti-Carrara, which overlooks the main street and is of seventeenth-century construction, restored between 1997 and 1999. The building contained a cycle of valuable frescoes by Gian Paolo Cavagna that, despite being under the protection of the ministry competent, they were torn between 1939 and 1942 by the last owners of the building and still missing. Only black and white photographs remain of the frescoes. [8] Of medieval origin are the remains of the castle of Capersegno still surrounded by coeval houses, used by settlers. In Presezzo there is also a disused military barracks, named after the military gold medalist Riccardo Moioli, an Italian soldier who died in Greece in 1944, during the Second World War.

Built in 1875 in place of a previous cult building, it presents numerous works dedicated to the two patron saints taken from the previous parish church. The church has an organ modified by the Serassi brothers around 1801. The organ was completely restored in 1984. [7]. The churchyard has recently been re-structured, paved and adorned with two olive trees Other important buildings are the Palazzo Furietti-Carrara, which overlooks the main street and is of seventeenth-century construction, restored between 1997 and 1999. The building contained a cycle of valuable frescoes by Gian Paolo Cavagna that, despite being under the protection of the ministry competent, they were torn between 1939 and 1942 by the last owners of the building and still missing. Only black and white photographs remain of the frescoes. [8] Of medieval origin are the remains of the castle of Capersegno still surrounded by coeval houses, used by settlers. In Presezzo there is also a disused military barracks, named after the military gold medalist Riccardo Moioli, an Italian soldier who died in Greece in 1944, during the Second World War. Moioli, despite being hit for the first time by an enemy projectile, continued in the battle until he was hit by a second blow, this fatal one, which killed him.

Description This fungus grows as a mycelium within the wood of living and dead trees. It forms fruiting bodies that are 3‚Äì30 cm wide √ó 5‚Äì50 cm long √ó 1‚Äì10 cm thick, hard as leather, woody-textured, and inedible. They are white at first but soon turn dark red-brown. Brown spores are released from the pores on the underside of the fruiting body. The tubes are 4-12 mm deep and terminate in pores that are round with 4-6 per millimetre. The fruiting bodies are perennial, and may persist for multiple years, increasing in size and forming new layers of pores as they grow. The similar Ganoderma brownii has thicker, darker flesh, often a yellow pore surface, and larger basidiospores than G. applanatum. Ganoderma applanatum is a wood-decay fungus, causing a rot of heartwood in a variety of trees. It can also grow as a pathogen of live sapwood, particularly on older trees that are sufficiently wet. It is a common cause of decay and death of beech and poplar, and less often of several other tree genera, including alder, apple, elm, buckeye and horse chestnut, maple, oak, walnut, willow, western hemlock, Douglas fir, old or sick olive tree and spruce. Uses sporocarp of G. applanatum A peculiarity of this fungus lies in its use as a drawing medium for artists. When the fresh white pore surface is rubbed or scratched with a sharp implement, dark brown tissue under the pores is revealed, resulting in visible lines and shading that become permanent once the fungus is dried. G. applanatum is a medicinal farming crop that is used as a flavor enhancer in Asian cuisine. G. applanatum is non-digestible in its raw form, but it is used for cooking, because of its rich mushroom flavor. Blending with filtration, or cold pressing in water, is a common method for creating ganoderma drinks. Hot herbal soups, or fermentation in lemon acid with onion is a common use for cooking with G. applanatum slices as an umami flavor enhancer in fermented foods. Ganoderma applanatum is known in Japan as kofuki-saru-no-koshikake („Ç≥„Éï„Ç≠„Çµ„É´„Éé„Ç≥„Ç∑„Ç´„Ç±), literally meaning \\"powder-covered monkey's bench\\", and in China as shu-she-ling-zhi (Ê†ëËàåÁÅµËäù), where it has long been used in traditional medicines. Studies have shown Ganoderma applanatum contains compounds with potent anti-tumor, antibacterial anti-fibrotic properties. Fungivory There is anecdotal references of higher primates consuming this fungus for self-medication. In the book Gorillas in the Mist Dian Fossey writes the following about gorillas eating Ganoderma applanatum: > Still another special food (for the gorillas) is bracket fungus (Ganoderma > applanatum)... The shelflike projection is difficult to break free, so > younger animals often have to wrap their arms and legs awkwardly around a > trunk and content themselves by only gnawing at the delicacy. Older animals > who succeed in breaking the fungus loose have been observed carrying it > several hundred feet from its source, all the while guarding it possessively > from more dominant individuals' attempts to take it away. Both the scarcity > of the fungus and the gorillas' liking of it cause many intragroup > squabbles, a number of which are settled by the silverback, who simply takes > the item of contention for himself. galls (black objects) of Agathomyia wankowiczii on an artist's bracket fungus The midge Agathomyia wankowiczii lays its eggs on the fruiting body of the fungus, forming galls. Female forked fungus beetles, Bolitotherus cornutus lay their eggs on the surface of the fruiting bodies and the larvae live inside of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma applanatum and a few other bracket fungi. Meanwhile, the fly Hirtodrosophila mycetophaga courts and mates entirely on the underside of dark fungi.

Family background and education Esther Roper (Seated), Edith Palliser (Left), Mrs. Blaxter (Right) Esther was the daughter of Edward Roper, a factory hand who later became a missionary, and Annie Roper, the daughter of Irish immigrants. She was educated by the Church Missionary Society. She was one of the first women to study for a degree at Owens College in Manchester. In 1886 she was admitted as part of a trial scheme to establish whether females could study without harm to their mental or physical health. In 1897 with fellow student Marion Ledward, she founded and edited Iris, a newsletter for female students. Issued twice yearly until 1894 the publication highlighted issues impacting on women‚Äôs education, and encouraged networking between current and former students. In 1891 Roper graduated from Owen‚Äôs College with a First class honours degree in Latin, English Literature and Political Economy. She maintained links with the college becoming a leading member of its women only Social Debating Society. In 1895 she helped establish the Manchester University Settlement in Ancoats to offer education and cultural opportunities to the local working poor. She was elected to its executive committee in 1896. Women's suffrage work From 1893 until 1905 she held the salaried position of secretary of the Manchester National Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage. Roper is credited with re-energising the organisation‚Äôs work which had lacked direction since the death of previous secretary Lydia Becker. Roper broadened the scope of the MNSWS votes for women campaign, steering the focus away from securing the interests of middle-class women, to actively seeking out the involvement of working-class women as petition signatories and speakers for the cause. In 1897 the MNSWS changed its name to the North of England Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage (NESWS) and became part of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Meeting Eva Gore- Booth In 1896, suffering from exhaustion Roper holidayed at Scottish writer George Macdonald's guest house in Italy. There she met Irish poet and aristocrat Eva Gore-Booth. The couple fell in love and the following year Gore-Booth gave up a life of privilege to move in with Roper in a terraced house in Rusholme, Manchester. Esther later wrote of their meeting in Italy ‚ÄúFor months illness kept us in the south, and we spent the days walking and talking on the hillside by the sea. Each was attracted to the work and thoughts of the other, and we soon became friends and companions for life.‚Äù Social justice and suffrage work with Eva-Gore Booth In the late 1800s and early 1900s Esther and Eva helped to organize groups of female flower-sellers, circus performers, barmaids and coal pit-brow workers as their right to work was threatened by moral crusades and new legislation. They arranged public meetings, demonstrations and delegations to parliament. Esther and Eva argued that women‚Äôs livelihoods were at stake, that women were capable of making their own decisions about how they were employed, and working women‚Äôs lack of vote left them disempowered in the workplace. In 1900 they founded and edited the Women's Labour News. This quarterly publication aimed at uniting women workers ran until 1904. In 1903 the couple helped to found the Lancashire and Cheshire Women's Textile and Other Workers Representation Committee, which organized the campaign of the first women's suffrage candidate to stand in a general election. In 1905, Esther became secretary of the National Industrial & Professional Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society. From 1906 Roper and Gore-Booth distanced themselves from Pankhurst‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union. They disagreed with the use of militant tactics and Emmeline Pankhurst‚Äôs lack of interest in campaigning for working-class women‚Äôs rights. In 1913 Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth moved to London for the sake of Eva's health. In 1916, along with transwoman Irene Clyde, they founded Urania, a privately circulated journal which expressed their pioneering views on gender and sexuality. Published six times a year it contained clippings of articles from national and international press as well as original pieces. They were prominent pacifists during the First World War, working in the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace. Among other things they helped support the wives and children of imprisoned conscientious objector. After the war they became members of the Committee for the Abolition of Capital Punishment and worked for prison reform. Later years After Eva's death in 1926, Esther worked to preserve her partner‚Äôs memory. She edited and introduced both The Poems of Eva Gore-Booth (1929) and The Prison Letters of Countess Markievicz (1934). Esther commissioned artist Ethel Rhind to create a stained glass window commemorating Eva‚Äôs life. It was unveiled in June 1928 at the re-opening of the University Settlement Roundhouse building on Every Street, Ancoats. The Roundhouse was demolished in 1986 by which time the window had been lost or stolen. In later years Esther continued her social justice campaigning. She was signatory on a number of letters to The Times newspaper concerning equal treatment for men and women in employment. Esther Roper died of heart failure at her home in April 1938. She was buried alongside Eva Gore-Booth in St John's churchyard, Hampstead, on 30 April, with a quote from lesbian icon Sappho carved on their gravestone. Constance Markievicz, Eva Gore-Booth's sister, wrote of her: \\"The more one knows her, the more one loves her, and I feel so glad Eva and she were together, and so thankful that her love was with Eva to the end.\\" Posthumous recognition Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

The club began its professional career playing in the Venezuelan Segunda Divisi√≥n a year after the club was founded. Since 2005, Aragua plays in the Primera Divisi√≥n Venezolana. The club's colors are yellow and red, although they were blue and white in the club's beginnings. Home games are played at the Ol√≠mpico Hermanos Ghersi in Maracay, with a 16,000 spectator capacity. Aragua won the 2005‚Äì06 Venezuelan Segunda Divisi√≥n and the 2007 Copa Venezuela. History =Deportivo Galicia= Founded in Caracas, the club moved, in 2002, to Maracay, in the state of Aragua, when its name changed to Galicia de Aragua, playing their home games at the Giuseppe Antonelli stadium in Maracay. Coached by the Uruguayan national Carlos Maria Ravel, the team switched from their traditional blue and white colours to the state's yellow and red and changed their name to Galicia de Aragua. At the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, Galicia de Aragua was relegated to the Venezuelan Segunda Division. In January 2002 they became a separate entity Aragua F.C. when they moved to Estadio Ol√≠mpico Hermanos Ghersi P√°ez. =Aragua FC= For the 2002‚Äì03 season, Deportivo Galicia moves to the Estadio Ol√≠mpico Hermanos Ghersi and changes name to Aragua F√∫tbol Club. The team continues to play in the Venezuelan Segunda Divisi√≥n until the 2004‚Äì05 season, when they achieve promotion to the Venezuelan Primera Divisi√≥n. Aragua FC make their debut in the Venezuelan Primera Divisi√≥n with a goalless tie against Trujillanos on 5 August 2005, and remaining unbeaten during the first five games of the season. Rafael Mea Vitali scored Aragua's first goal in the top flight. Aragua FC end up finishing the 2005‚Äì06 season in 7th place. At the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, goalkeeper Renny Vega is called up by national team coach Richard P√°ez to represent the Venezuela national football team in a match against Colombia, making Vega the first player to receive an international call-up while playing for Aragua FC. In 2008, led by manager Manolo Contreras, Aragua won the Copa Venezuela and automatically qualified to participate in the 2008 edition of the Copa Sudamericana, where they were eliminated in the first round by Guadalajara. At the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Jos√© Salom√≥n Rond√≥n was awarded as Youth of the Year, marking the first time that an Aragua FC player received the distinction. Titles *Venezuelan Segunda Divisi√≥n: 1 ::2005 *Copa Venezuela: 1 ::2007 Performance in CONMEBOL competitions *Copa Sudamericana: 1 appearance ::2008: First Round Club Culture =Supporters= The Aragua FC fans are known as Los Vikingos (The Vikings), and they traditionally occupy the western stand of the stadium, known as La Popular (The Popular). They are made up of several factions that represent different cities across the state: Artiller√≠a Aurirroja (Yellow and Red Artillery), Cagua Aurirroja, Ca√±a de Az√∫car, El Lim√≥n, Turmero Aurirrojo, Santa Rita, and Santa Rosa Aurirroja. As is the case with supporter groups of other Venezuelan teams, the factions only exist in theory, and in practice all the supporters act as a unified body. =Rivalries= The club's main rival is Carabobo FC, from the neighboring state of Carabobo. The fixture is popularly known as El Cl√°sico de la Autopista (The Highway Classic). Due to the proximity of both states' capitals, Aragua-Carabobo rivalries exist in virtually every professional sport practiced in Venezuela. In 18 encounters, Aragua has achieved 6 victories against Carabobo's 4. The classic is currently \\"on hold\\" since Carabobo was relegated to the Venezuelan Segunda Divisi√≥n after the 2011‚Äì12 season.

The Northeast Plain includes Songnen Plain in the north, Liaohe Plain in the south, and Sanjiang Plain in the northeast. The Songnen plain was formed by the Songhua and alluvial soils from the Nen. The Liaohe plain, located in the hilly areas near Changchun, was created by the separation of watersheds of the Songhua and Liaohe, which are collectively known as the Liaohe plain. The Sanjiang plain, at the confluence of the Sungari, Amur, and Ussuri rivers, was originally a swamp known as the \\"Great Northern Wilderness\\", becoming a food- producing area after reclamation. The original wetland area of the Sanjiang plain has been greatly reduced. It is suitable for mechanized farming, with thick and fertile soil and extensive amounts of arable land. The plain is a major Chernozem-producing region of the world. Huge areas are planted with wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, sugar beets, sunflowers, sorghum, and flax. The landscape is rich in resources such as iron ore, coal, and oil. After 1949, land reclamation began on the plain and state farms were established. There are very few trees on this landscape that have not been planted, typically poplars in long rows along roads, or on either side of the train tracks. There are not many fences on the landscape, no long running fences, though there are many wooden or stone fences adjacent to the houses.

The commune is located at the beginning of the Cavallina Valley and it's crossed by two main roads: the Strada Statale 42 del Tonale e della Mendola and the Provincial Road 91 to the Lake Iseo. It is home to a large Cluniac monastery, founded in 1079. It was restored in the 16th century, as shown by the perfectly geometrical Renaissance cloisters (1500 and 1532). In the former refectory there are frescoes (1624) by Giovanni Battista Lorenzetti. The annexed church, dedicated to the Conversion of Saint Paul, was rebuilt between 1684 and 1690 on an ancient romanesque one and represents one of the most impressive examples of Baroque architecture in Bergamo. Its white fa√ßade in local marble dates back to 1690. The single wide nave's vault is completely decorated with frescoes by Giulio Quaglio (1712-13). Three little chapels open up on the two sides of the nave. Other artworks include canvasses by Giuseppe Maria Crespi, Sebastiano Ricci and Antonio Balestra. The bell tower was rebuilt in 1738 as reported on its eastern side too. Until the early 20th century, the town was known as Buzzone, while the name \\"San Paolo d'Argon\\" designed the monastic complex. From 1929 to 1948 San Paolo d'Argon was united with the neighbouring villages of Cenate Sotto and Cenate Sopra forming a single commune called Cenate d'Argon.

It is currently used mostly for football matches, on club level by Real Potos√≠ and Nacional Potos√≠. The stadium has a capacity of 32,000 people.  History  The stadium was originally called Estadio San Clemente from 1992 to 2000 but was renamed Mario Mercado Vaca Guzm√°n after some modifications on the structure, including new illumination towers, were made. In 1997, the stadium underwent its first expansion, completing the remaining 2 sections, general and north curve, raising its capacity to 13,000 spectators. In 2007 the club qualified for the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana. In order to accommodate the spectators expected for these cups, the stadium underwent another expansion and remodeling in 2008. The capacity was increased to 32,000 spectators, doubling the size of the south bend, north bend and preferred sections, and almost tripling the general capacity. There was also an implementation of a roof around the whole stadium, and the name of the stadium was changed to Estadio V√≠ctor Agust√≠n Ugarte, in tribute to the former Bolivian footballer. Located at about 4,000 meters above sea level, the stadium is one of the highest in the world. It has raised numerous controversies in footballing clubs, as its significant altitude affects the absorption of oxygen in the human body, offering considerable advantage to the home team who are more accustomed to such conditions.

Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Sousa, 4th Count of Prado and 2nd Marqu√™s of Minas (6 April 1644 ‚Äì 25 December 1721) was a Portuguese general and governor-general of the Portuguese colony of Brazil. He was the son of Dom Francisco, the first Marqu√™s das Minas, and his second wife D. Eufr√°sia Filipa de Lima. From a very young age on, he was destined for a military career. At the age of 14, he was present with his father at the Battle of the Lines of Elvas. The following years, he fought the Spanish in the northern Minho province, becoming a general in 1665 after the conquest of the galician town of A Guarda. After the Peace Treaty of Lisbon he became military governor of Minho in the absence of his father, who was sent as ambassador to Rome. He assumed the title of Marqu√™s das Minas after the death of his father in 1674. Between 1684 and 1687 he was governor-general of Brazil. He had to restore the peace after the mismanagement of his predecessors, and was confronted with a serious epidemic in the Bahia province. In 1687 he returned to Portugal and was appointed counsellor of war. War of the Spanish Succession At the outbreak of the War of Spanish Succession (1702-1715), King Peter II of Portugal initially supported France but on 16 May 1703, Portugal and England signed the Methuen Treaty. This trade accord was followed in December 1703 by a military alliance between Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands and Great Britain against Philip, the French candidate for the Spanish throne. Minas was sent to the border to prepare the Portuguese army for war, but in 1704 the Franco-Spanish troops attacked first. The Duke of Berwick conquered Salvaterra, Segura and Beira. Tilly invaded Alentejo and took Portalegre, and the Spanish general Villadarias took Castelo de Vide. The invasion was stopped by lack of support from Madrid, allied invasions of Barcelona and Gibraltar and the resistance organised by Minas (who won a minor battle at Monsanto). Berwick had to withdraw his troops to Spain. In October 1705 a first invasion of Spain was launched under the command of Henri de Massue, 1st Earl of Galway and the Marquess of Minas. The aim was to conquer Badajoz, thus opening a second front to support Peterborough in Catalonia. But the relationship between the two allied commanders was so bad, and the coordination so poor, that it wasn't too difficult for the experienced French commander de Tess√© to repel the invasion. In 1706 de Tess√© was beaten near Barcelona, and it became apparent that the border with Portugal was unprotected. Minas took his chance and marched his army all the way to Madrid, bypassing Badajoz. The stiffest resistance was met at Alc√°ntara, where the garrison of 4200 resisted for 5 days until it had to capitulate. The army of the Duke of Berwick was in the vicinity, but wasn't strong enough to risk a battle. On 28 June 1706 the Portuguese army entered Madrid and Archduke Charles was acclaimed King of Spain. But very soon it became clear that the allies in Madrid were very isolated. The population was hostile and the Duke of Berwick was cutting off communications with Portugal and Aragon. The decision was made to abandon Madrid and to join the allied troops in Valencia. The Duke of Berwick was waiting for them and inflicted a crushing defeat in the Battle of Almansa. Minas was replaced as commander of the Portuguese troops in Spain by his nephew Pedro Manuel de Ata√≠de. On his return to Portugal he was appointed estribeiro-mor (chief equerry) to the queen, for the rest of his life. As Marquis of Minas, he was succeeded by his son Jo√£o de Sousa, 3rd Marquis of Minas.

It was written by series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, and directed by David Nutter. The Smallville pilot introduces the characters of Clark Kent, an orphaned alien with superhuman abilities, and his friends and family who live in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas. It follows Clark as he first learns of his alien origins, and attempts to stop a vengeful student from killing Smallville High School students. The episode introduces many themes that were designed to run either the course of the season or the entire series, such as the triangular relationships of the main characters. Production was set in Vancouver, Canada, used for its \\"middle America\\" landscape, with five months devoted to casting the right actors in the lead roles. Filming for the pilot officially began four days after the last actor was cast for the series. When time constraints would not allow the production crew to physically create the sets, computer-generated imagery was used to digitally insert set pieces into a scene. When the series premiere was broadcast, it broke several of The WB's viewership records. It was generally well received by critics, and was nominated for various awards, winning two.  Plot and themes introduced  The episode begins in 1989 when a meteor shower hits Smallville; at the same time a small spacecraft, containing an alien boy, crashes in front of Jonathan and Martha Kent's (played by John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) truck. They adopt the superhumanly powerful child and name him Clark. Gough and Millar use this opening scene to establish that the three lead characters of the series, Clark, Lana and Lex, share a common bond‚Äîthey are all without one or both parents: Clark is the only survivor of his homeworld; Lana's parents are killed in the meteor shower; and Lex is alienated from his father, Lionel Luthor (John Glover), after being rendered bald by the meteor blast. The episode jumps forward twelve years to when Clark (Tom Welling) is trying to find his identity. He is unable to handle being told of his alien origins and runs away from home. Although he is attracted to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), he cannot get close to her without falling over in pain because she wears a necklace made of meteor rock (kryptonite), which is a radioactive fragment of Clark's destroyed homeworld. This was a concept Gough and Millar devised to establish a reason for Clark's clumsiness. In other media, it is usually portrayed as an act he puts on to deceive people of his true identity. But Clark and Lana do share an intimate moment at a cemetery, where Lana is visiting the grave of her parents. In such scenes, Gough and Millar created a theme of loneliness through the life stories of Clark and Lana. Lana's boyfriend, Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson), becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's friendship and ties Clark to a scarecrow pole, using Lana's necklace, indirectly, to subdue Clark. This image of Clark, in just his underwear and a red \\"S\\" painted on his chest, stretches back to Gough and Millar's foundation for the series, which was about taking Clark down to the basic elements of the Superman character. In the second strand of the story, Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and Clark develop a \\"yin and yang\\" relationship. Clark first saves Lex from drowning when they get into a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saves Clark when he is strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. Jeremy Creek (Adrian McMorran)‚Äîwho was mutated by the meteor rocks, gaining special powers‚Äîputs the three former jocks, who tied him to a scarecrow pole during the meteor shower, into comas. He sets out to kill everyone attending the school's dance, after witnessing Clark experience the same hazing he did, but Clark is able to arrive in time to stop him.  Production  = Casting = Tom Welling initially refused the role of Clark Kent twice before taking the test for the role. Gough and Millar had five months for casting, but their primary focus was on finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They received Kristin Kreuk's audition tape for the role of Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network.Simpson, pp. 8‚Äì17 Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity to be part of the show.Simpson, pp. 112‚Äì115. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be \\"Superman in high school\\", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was \\"amazing\\". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had \\"great chemistry\\". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice,Simpson, pp. 120‚Äì123. and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was \\"the guy\\". John Schneider was brought in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough believed Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed‚ÄîEttinger included‚Äîthat she was not right for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.Simpson, pp. 136‚Äì139. Eric Johnson, after auditioning for the roles of Lex and Clark, was cast as Lana Lang's boyfriend Whitney Fordman. Johnson only spent one day filming his scenes for the pilot.Simpson, pp. 132‚Äì135. Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan.Simpson, pp. 128‚Äì131. The character was created just for the series and was intended to add ethnic diversity to the cast, but part of the reason Gough and Millar chose to cast Mack, against their initial intentions to give the character an ethnic background, was because they were impressed with Allison Mack's \\"rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary dialogue conversationally\\". Sam Jones III, who plays Pete Ross, was the last of the series regulars to be cast. Gough and Millar saw Jones four days before they began filming for the pilot. In the comics, Pete Ross is Caucasian, and the producers chose to cast Jones, who is African-American, against the mythology.Simpson, pp. 124‚Äì127. = Filming = Once Warner Bros. Television secured the rights to the show, Gough and Millar set out to write the script and find a director for the pilot. Gough and Millar were fans of director David Nutter's previous work; they considered him to be a \\"preeminent pilot director\\". David Nutter joined the project because he wanted to make a pilot that respected the audience but that was still fun and smart. Nutter also believes in creating shows that appeal to a wide variety of audiences.Simpson, pp. 20‚Äì23. He wanted the final scene for the pilot, in which Clark fantasizes about dancing with Lana, to express the show's essence. According to Welling, \\"It brings them close‚Äînot as close as Clark would like, but at the end of [this] episode, he imagines that he's with her and can really see it happening.\\" Production was initially slated to take place in Australia, but Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada had more of the \\"middle America\\" feel for which the creators were looking. The area offered a site for the Kent farm, including their barn, and the city itself doubled as Metropolis. Vancouver provided a cheaper shooting location, and was in the same time zone as Los Angeles. Filming began in March 2001; Nutter spent sixteen days on main unit filming and an additional five days for second unit filming. Time constraints forced Nutter to film strictly from Adrien Van Viersen's 150‚Äìpage storyboard when filming the opening meteor shower scene. Much of the look for Smallville came from Millar, who wanted the epitome of \\"Smalltown, USA\\". Construction coordinator Rob Maier explained, \\"It had to be cleaner than clean, nicer than nice, more beautiful than it would be in the real world. All of the people in Smallville are beautiful; all of the colors are bright and sharp.\\" For the Kent farm, Nutter wanted to have \\"an old world sensibility and tone\\". For the pilot, the production crew only built a kitchen and dining room to represent the Kent home.Simpson, pp. 24‚Äì27. All the exterior shots of the farm were taken at the Andalinis farm, owned by a local couple who also gave the crew permission to paint their forest green house yellow. Since the Vancouver farm already had a barn, the production crew only had to build a loft with stairs leading up to it. Hatley Castle provides the outside look of the Luthor ancestral home, but the interior was shot at Shannon Mews, in Vancouver. Exterior shots of the Luthor Mansion were shot at the Hatley Castle in Victoria, two hours west of Vancouver by ferry. Time constraints forced scenes, which were shot from multiple angles, to sometimes be shot at separate locations. A scene involving Whitney (Eric Johnson) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) sitting on her porch was shot at two different locations. Close-ups of Whitney were shot under a football stadium, while close-ups of Lana were shot in a potato-processing factory. Unable to shoot at the house being used as the Lang residence, the crew built Lana's front porch inside a sewage processing facility for the final scene of the episode where Lana walks up the stairs to her house. The local sewage treatment facility is also the site for the LuthorCorp pesticide plant, which Lex was sent to Smallville to manage. The crash site of Clark's ship was shot at the sandpits where Mission to Mars was filmed. Smallville's Main Street was filmed in both the town of Merritt, which is three hours east of Vancouver, and in the town of Cloverdale. Most of the filming took place in Cloverdale, since the town had a long stretch of vacant buildings that could double as Smallville's Main Street. When the production crew came to film the opening teaser, they had to decorate the town with ribbons and balloons, as well as paint some of the buildings to attain Millar's idea of \\"Smalltown, USA\\". Two sets were built just for the pilot. The Kent storm cellar was built as a cover set inside the farm's barn. For the cemetery scene between Clark and Lana, production designer Bernard Hides built the entire cemetery from scratch in an empty field. = Effects = On-set computer-generated effects for the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening sequence showing the destruction of the water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse for the pilot, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.  Release and reception  \\"Pilot\\" premiered on The WB on October 16, 2001. 8.4 million viewers watched the pilot's debut, breaking The WB's record for highest ratings for a new series. The pilot broke The WB's ratings record for the 18‚Äì49 male demographic, with 3.9 million viewers; it became the third-highest rated debut for the overall adult 18‚Äì49 demographic, with an average 3.8 million viewers. The premiere also finished first with viewers age 12‚Äì34, leading Warner Bros. President of Entertainment Jordan Levin to credit the series with invigorating the network's Tuesday night lineup. The pilot won an Emmy Award for Sound Editing; it had also been nominated for Visual Effects but lost to UPN's Star Trek: Enterprise. The special effects team won a Leo Award for Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series. Casting directors Deedee Bradley, Coreen Mayrs, and Barbara Miller were nominated for an Artios Award for their work on the pilot. The pilot was nominated for two Golden Reel Awards, one for Effects & Foley Sound Editing and one for Music Sound Editing. Peter Wunstorf was also nominated for an American Society of Cinematographers Award for his work on the pilot. The pilot, along with the second episode \\"Metamorphosis\\", was released in Canada as a special pilot movie. The episodes were altered on the DVD; formatted in 1.78 widescreen, and presented with no opening segment and an alternate closing. It also contained the same special features present in the DVD box set of the first season. The pilot received favorable reviews upon its release. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette thought it was a \\"respectful addition to Superman lore\\" and had \\"all the markings of a super series\\". Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, \\"Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?\\" Echoing Owen, DVD Verdict noted the same symbolism: > Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a > messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in > its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a > cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation > of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good > of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that > role. Elizabeth White of Media Life believed the show had potential to be a big hit for The WB but felt it needed to survive not only its time slot‚ÄîTuesdays at 9:00 p.m. (EST)‚Äîbut also the audience's expectations of \\"what Superman should be\\". USA Today's Robert Bianco was a bit more mixed in his criticism. Bianco stated, \\"For all its innovations, there's also something rehashed and repetitive about Smallville... shows often look more familiar at the outset than they do as they progress. There's talent and intelligence at work in Smallville. Given time, maybe they'll find a more distinctive voice.\\" Jeremy Conrad, from IGN, swore to himself that he would never watch Smallville, because he was a \\"huge Superman fan\\" and he did not like the idea the creators would be making changes to the Superman mythology. After viewing the pilot, Conrad stated, \\"It's a very solid start to the series, and one of the better pilot episodes I've seen in a while.\\" In The Futon Critic's 50 best episodes of 2001 rankings, the pilot was placed 31st, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, \\"Smallville opened us to a surprisingly fresh take on the Superman myth-this time showing us the humble beginnings of a young Clark Kent.\\" The CW re-aired the pilot on Friday, April 8, 2011 in preparation for the series finale. The episode was watched by 1.55 million viewers and achieved a 0.5 Adults 18-49 rating, despite only 92% coverage.

Reichelt is one of the main authors of the ‚ÄúNeue Marx-Lekt√ºre‚Äù (new Marx reading) and considered to be one of the most important theorists in the field of Marx's theory of value. He studied economics, sociology and philosophy in Frankfurt where Theodor W. Adorno supervised his diploma in 1968. In 1970 Reichelt obtained his Ph.D at the Institute for Social Research. In 1971 he became professor of sociology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. One year later he was also appointed as the dean of the philosophy department in Frankfurt. On the initiative of Alfred Sohn-Rethel Reichelt accepted the Professorship for social theory at the department of Sociology at the University of Bremen in 1978. He remained in Bremen until his retirement in 2005. Reichelt's research interests are the theory of society with special emphasis on the problems of the theory of economic value. Already during his time as a university student he began a long-term cooperation with Hans-Georg Backhaus. Together with Backhaus he considered engaging with economic phenomena and economic theory as fundamental for critical theory. Since 1998 Reichelt and Backhaus contributions have spawned a rich debate on theories of economic value and its relation to critical theory. Reichelt has published widely on Marx, on Adorno's social theory and on economic theory. Reichelt also oversaw an edition of Hegel's Philosophy of Right in the Ullstein Verlag.

The area consists mainly of former local authority housing built between the late 1940s and the mid-1950s by D√∫n Laoghaire Borough Corporation. Location and boundaries On early 20th century maps, Sallynoggin and Glenageary are indicated as being the same place, however, with the development of the local authority housing estate on the Townlands of Honeypark and Thomastown, Sallynoggin became a distinct area. Up to 1994 the boundary of D√∫n Laoghaire Borough Corporation left a section of the local authority housing outside the D√∫n Laoghaire area mainly Pearse Villas and a part of Pearse Street which were in the Dublin County Council area. With the formation of D√∫n Laoghaire, Rathdown County Council in 1994 the entire area of Sallynoggin, Rochestown, and surrounding areas were included in the new county. Etymology The Irish Placenames Commission has researched the origin and meaning of Sallynoggin as a placename. In fact, the name is not Irish at all but English deriving from the \\"sally noggins\\" which referred to old timber-frame houses that were known to be situated there. The modern Irish word for noggin is the phonetic \\"naig√≠n\\" hence \\"An Naig√≠n\\" (The Noggin) as it is commonly called. More than likely this is a placename of English origin. Examples of the word naggin or noggin were collected in Hiberno-English, meaning ‚Äòa wooden vessel‚Äô. The origin of the word is unclear to lexicographers. The following meaning of the word noggin also appears in the English Dialect Dictionary, ‚Äòthe clay and sticks, or bricks used to fill the interstices of half-timbered houses‚Äô. This is a more likely explanation of ‚Äòsallynoggins‚Äô; in other words, sally-rods may have been used in the construction of the houses. Amenities There are playing fields on either side of Sallynoggin Road with a clubhouse for St Josephs Boys AFC football club on Pearse Road. There are both large and small retail units in Sallynoggin, including on Sallynoggin Road, Pearse Street and Church Place. Sallynoggin has a primary school, St. Kevin's National School, located on Pearse Street, from which some pupils move on to the nearby Holy Child Community School. The former Technical School on Pearse Street is now the Sallynoggin College of Further Education and offers third-level courses. Rathdown School, a Church of Ireland girls school is located here too. Sallynoggin Youth and Community Centre, opened in October 2008, offers youth groups, youth clubs, under 10's group, senior citizens group, estate management, local voluntary groups and Sallynoggin Neighbourhood Watch. https://www.dlrcoco.ie/en/community/community-centres-facilities/sallynoggin- youth-community-facility The Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland routes which serve the Sallynoggin area include the 7/A (Loughlinstown Park/Brides Glen LUAS Station to Mountjoy Square), 7b (Shankill to Mountjoy Square), and 45a Kilmacanogue to D√∫n Laoghaire and 111 to Dalkey). goaheadireland.iedublinbus.ie Glenageary Train Station is nearby.Google Maps Religion The Roman Catholic Parish of Sallynoggin covers the estates of Sallynoggin, Rochestown, Beechwood and Thomastown.

MOMS is an acronym for Moms Offering Moms Support. History MOMS Club was founded in 1983 by Mary James, a stay-at-home mother of two from California. Weary of being home alone all day, James wanted to connect with other at-home moms in her area. She also desired playmates for her children. When she discovered that there were no existing organizations that met during the day and that designed activities for moms and children to enjoy together, she decided to start her own group. Based on the success of this initial chapter, MOMS Club spread throughout the country. Today, there are 973IRS Form 990 (2017) Page 2, Question 4A chapters in the United States, as well as international chapters. Activities Although activities vary by chapter, most clubs offer some form of the following: monthly meetings, playgroups, mom's nights out, holiday parties, field trips, community speakers and service projects. Controversy In June 2020, MOMS Club of Rancho Santa Margarita submitted a collage of pictures with an anti-racist message and requested it be posted to the International Chapter's Facebook page. The collage spelled out ‚ÄúWe. Stand. With. All. Moms. And. Pledge. That. Racial. Discrimination. Will. Stop. With. Our. Kids.‚Äù and was done after the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed. The international organization declined to share the image on their Facebook page with the reasoning that the message was political and could jeopardize the non-profit status of the organization. After push-back, the International MOMS Club responded that \\"graphics like that collage ... imply that our members have been racists before now. The MOMS Club has never been a racist organization and never will be. To imply otherwise is not acceptable.\\" In response, hundreds of women and chapters across the country left the organization. Per the MOMS Club bylaws, chapters do not seek political and religious focus, instead the chapters are geared towards what binds mothers together, which is: the sisterhood of motherhood, children and community.

Their activities include working to reform the government school system, helping village students in their education, awakening youth to the problems stemming from inappropriate and insensitive schooling, producing related videos and radio programmes, and designing and building solar-heated eco-friendly buildings.Official WebsiteReach Ladakh Phey campus 300pxSECMOL Campus is located near the village of Phey in the Indus valley 18 km from Leh. It was developed between 1994 and 1999 and was inaugurated in 1998 by the Dalai Lama. Built using simple, low-cost traditional techniques, the campus now comprises three residential houses, 20 small \\"cell rooms\\" and a large school building, all solar heated. Part of SECMOL's work is to develop techniques that use alternative energy sources. Ladakh has over 300 sunny days per year and the sun is therefore a reliable source of energy and an alternative to fossil fuels.Future Earth The campus is home to about 70 students and a few staff and volunteers, who live, work and study there.

Since then, three more programs (Nyumbani Village, Lea Toto and Nyumbani Diagnostic Laboratory) have been added to the organization.  Background  Originally a medical doctor in the US Air Force, D'Agostino joined the Jesuits early in his career, focused on psychiatry, and held various teaching positions. But it was through his experience working with multiple Jesuit charities that D'Agostino learned of the dire need for specialized facilities for abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Today over 100 orphans or abandoned children live at Nyumbani Children's Home located in Karen, Nairobi. In 1998, the recognition that there was a need to expand the basic initiative of Nyumbani Home to other locales gave birth to the Lea Toto program. This is \\"a community-based outreach program providing services to HIV+ children and their families in the Kangemi, Waithaka, Kawangware, Riruta, Mutuini, Ruthimitu, Kibera and Kariobangi communities of Nairobi, Kenya.\\" Nyumbani‚Äôs Lea Toto HIV/AIDS program operates eight centers and serves between 2,100 and 3,100 HIV-positive children and up to 15,000 family members every year. In 2006, Nyumbani Village, which cares for over 1,000 children and 100 elderly grandparents, was established on 1,000 acres in Kitui County, Kenya. The Nyumbani programs are supported by international boards the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Kenya. In addition to individual donations and corporate sponsorships, the executive boards around the world raise critical operating funds, provide expertise and much-needed volunteers.  Nyumbani Village  Based on past success, a related effort called Nyumbani Village was spawned to support both orphans and elders impacted by the AIDS pandemic. Located on donated by the Kitui District County Council, Nyumbani Village is conceived to support between 1280-1600 individuals via a self- sustaining agricultural based venture. Shortly after its inauguration, on 20 November 2006, Fr. D'Ag died. But with his organizational skills, this new venture also continued to prosper. In 2016 it had 120 employees tending to 100 elderly grandparents and 1000 children. In September 2016, actress Danai Gurira presented a video about the village and the work being done in Africa as part of the 2016 Global Citizen Festival in New York City and BBC has covered its learning curve in the use of drugs. The pharmaceuticals company Johnson & Johnson is a sponsoring partner via Global Citizen, in an outreach effort to promote social action and awareness.

A tenacious, reliable, and determined defender, he was known for his tactical versatility and work-rate, as he was capable of playing both as a full-back and as a centre-back, although he was usually deployed as a right-back, despite his lack of notable technical ability. Porrini played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, although he is mostly famous for his periods at Juventus, and Scottish club Rangers, where he won several titles. He is currently an assistant coach for the Albania national football team. Club career After growing up in the A.C. Milan youth system (failing to appear for the first team, however), Porrini made his senior debut in 1989 for Atalanta, remaining with the club for four seasons, where he made his emergence. After attracting attention from larger clubs, he joined Juventus in 1993 for 11 billion Lit., featuring as a starter during the 1993‚Äì94 season under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. During the 1994‚Äì95 season, however, he had difficulty finding a place in the team's starting line-up under the club's new manager Marcello Lippi; due to Lippi's new three-man back-line, Porrini faced heavy competition from other defenders, such as Moreno Torricelli, and J√ºrgen Kohler, as well as back-up Massimo Carrera. In particular, Porrini was kept out of the starting eleven by the newly acquired Ciro Ferrara, whom Lippi had even moved onto the right flank in order to accommodate him into the team's new back-line. Despite his limited appearances for Juventus during the season, Porrini still proved to be decisive for the team: he notably scored two goals over both legs of the club's 1995 Coppa Italia Final victory over Parma, as well as a crucial goal in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Borussia Dortmund, in the second leg of the semi-final of the UEFA Cup, helping his team to reach the final of the tournament, where Juventus lost out to Parma; he captured his first Serie A title with the club that season. Porrini made 20 appearances for the club during the 1995‚Äì96 season, which saw Juventus capture the 1995 Supercoppa Italiana, but remained on the sidelines as Juventus celebrated their victory on penalties over defending champions Ajax in the 1996 UEFA Champions League Final. During the 1996‚Äì97 season, he made 40 appearances, due to Torricelli's injury, scoring two goals, one of which was the opening goal in Juventus's 6‚Äì1 away win over Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the 1996 UEFA Super Cup, helping the Turin club to win the title; Porrini picked up his second league title with the club that season. He also started in Juventus's 1‚Äì0 victory over River Plate in the 1996 Intercontinental Cup Final in Tokyo, and in the club's 3‚Äì1 defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the 1997 Champions League Final in Munich. Porrini eventually parted ways with the Turin side at the end of the season. Overall, Porrini made 87 league appearances for Juventus, scoring three goals, and 138 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring five goals in total. With Juventus, Porrini won two Serie A medals, one Coppa Italia medal, and a Champions League medal during his four seasons with the team, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana, the UEFA Super Cup, and the Intercontinental Cup. Porrini subsequently joined Scottish club Rangers in 1997, for ¬£4 million and won two Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup medals, as well as a League Cup title during his four seasons in Scotland. He started off his Rangers career at centre-back alongside Richard Gough but new manager Dick Advocaat soon moved him to right- back where he remained until he left the club in 2001. In total, he made 133 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring seven goals, six of which came in league play in 80 appearances. He left Rangers to resume his football career in Italy at Alessandria for a season, later moving to Padova. After two seasons with Padova, Porrini joined lowly Pizzighettone in 2004 and retired after five full seasons spent with the small Lombardian club at Lega Pro Prima Divisione and Lega Pro Seconda Divisione levels, in 2009. International career While at Juventus, Porrini gained two international caps for Italy in 1993, under manager Arrigo Sacchi, appearing in two 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. He made his international debut in a 6‚Äì1 home win over Malta, in Palermo, on 24 March, and his second and final appearance with Italy came on 14 April, in a 2‚Äì0 home victory over Estonia, in Trieste. Coaching career After his retirement, Porrini agreed to stay with Pizzighettone as youth coach for a season, then filling a similar role at Pergocrema. In August 2011, he was then named head coach of Serie D club Colognese. On 23 June 2012, he was named head coach of Serie D club Pontisola. In 2019, he joined Albania national football team as an assistant to Edoardo Reja, whom he previously assisted at Atalanta.https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/sport/football/florian-kamberi-set- albania-call-17217117 Honours =Player= Juventus *Serie A: 1994‚Äì95, 1996‚Äì97 *Coppa Italia: 1994‚Äì95 *Supercoppa Italiana: 1995, 1997 *UEFA Champions League: 1995‚Äì96 *UEFA Super Cup: 1996 *Intercontinental Cup: 1996 *UEFA Cup (Runner-up): 1994‚Äì95 Rangers *Scottish Premier League: 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì2000 *Scottish Cup: 1999‚Äì2000 *Scottish League Cup: 1998‚Äì99 References External links * Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:Sportspeople from Milan Category:Italian footballers Category:Italy international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Serie A players Category:Serie C players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912 players Category:A.S.

As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 6,004 and an area of .All demographics and other statistics: Italian statistical institute Istat. Terno d'Isola borders the following municipalities: Bonate Sopra, Calusco d'Adda, Carvico, Chignolo d'Isola, Mapello, Medolago, Sotto il Monte Giovanni XXIII. Geography The town is located in the Bergamo area, is about from the provincial seat. History The first permanent settlements occurred in Roman times, when the conquistadors instituted a territorial district in the area called \\"Pagus Fortunensis\\". In that historical period, the village, as well as the entire area of the island was affected by strong trade and military, given the presence of two important roads of communication that mark the territory: one between the cities of Bergamo and Milan to south, and another that linked the capital Orobico in Como in the north. The term Roman Empire was subject to Terno barbarian invasions that took years of looting and terrorizing the population. In the sixth century, the political situation stabilized with the arrival first of the Lombards, and then the Franks. Terno in this period was considered the island's main town, so that the neighboring towns were placed under the jurisdiction of his parish church: in this sense is a valuable written record that dates back to 774, confirming the new order of the Parish of Terni. However, in the late Middle Ages that saw this situation as a town Terno p√π important proved to be a profoundly destabilizing element, given the willingness of different lordships to gain dominance over it: many battles between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and later between the armies of Milan and Venice, put a strain on the people who lived centuries of poverty, so that the island was called \\"the triangle of hunger.\\" In this sense the description is very clear in a document of time: \\"Here there are no traffic nor merchandise, people are poor by lavoradori terre et bracenti, such grains do not collect a penalty for their living, and they have no privilege, but subject to all the tributes to datii et ... \\" Is there any news of devastation and looting, the main one being perpetrated in 1406 by troops of the leader Bartolomeo Colleoni. The situation seemed to improve with the arrival of the Republic of Venice, inserting Terno district called Quadra Island to establish it as the capital and seat of the mayor. The Venetians took over in 1797 the Cisalpine Republic in 1815 but soon replaced by the Austrians, who inserts it in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Veneto, moving the capital to Chignolo. With the unification of Italy was a first but decisive process of industrialization, which allowed a significant improvement of living conditions of population. Points of interest The building is undoubtedly the most interesting provostal church of St. Victor, who played a key role in the history of the country and the whole area. It is no news as early as 774, when it was built in place of a previous building of pagan worship and had jurisdiction over the churches of the other villages of the island. Repeatedly subjected to renovation and rebuilding, still retains elements of the original structure, and a neo-Gothic facade and numerous sculptures and paintings, among which they include some of Enea Salmeggia and Bartolomeo Nazari. Folkloristic events The week before the summer solstice, in Terno it's held the Palio di San Donato, a week of celebration involving all the community. During this week, people dressed with medieval clothes behave as if the town was back in that period. The Palio consists in a race of donkeys with 10 contendents belonging to different part of the town called contrade. This Palio was held for the first time in 1984.

She married Desha Breckinridge, editor of the Lexington Herald, which advocated women's rights, and she lived to see the women of Kentucky vote for the first time in the presidential election of 1920. She also initiated progressive reforms for compulsory school attendance and child labor. She founded many civic organizations, notably the Kentucky Association for the Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis, an affliction from which she had personally suffered. She led efforts to implement model schools for children and adults, parks and recreation facilities, and manual training programs. In their book, A New History of Kentucky, Lowell H. Harrison and James C. Klotter, state that Breckinridge was the most influential woman in the state. She was named one of the Kentucky Women Remembered in 1996 and her portrait is permanently displayed at the state capitol. Biography =Early life and family= Breckinridge at her desk She was born in Woodlake, Kentucky and grew up at Ashland, the farm established by her great-grandfather, nineteenth-century statesman Henry Clay. Her mother was Henry Clay, Jr.'s daughter, Anne Clay McDowell, and her father was Major Henry Clay McDowell (a namesake of Henry Clay), who served during the American Civil War on the Union side. They purchased the Ashland estate in 1882. She was one of seven children. There were four boys, Henry Clay, William Adair, Thomas Clay and Ballard. Her two sisters were Nanette and Julia. Henry was a federal judge and Thomas was a renowned thoroughbred racehorse owner, breeder and trainer who won the 1902 Kentucky Derby. Breckinridge was grandniece of Dr. Ephraim McDowell. Her distant cousin, Laura Clay, founded the Kentucky Equal Rights Association in 1888, of which Breckinridge later became president. =Education= She was educated in Lexington, Kentucky, at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, and at State College (now the University of Kentucky) between 1890 and 1894. She suffered from illness during her college years and, due to tuberculosis of the bone, part of one leg was amputated and she received a wooden leg. The once athletic young woman became more studious. She wrote book reviews for the Lexington Herald and studied German philosophy and literature with other Fortnightly Club members. =Marriage= On November 17, 1898, Madeline McDowell married Desha Breckinridge, the editor of the Lexington Herald. He was the brother of the lawyer and pioneering social worker Sophonisba Breckinridge, who wrote a biography of her sister-in-law entitled Madeline McDowell Breckinridge: A Leader in the New South. The Breckinridges together used the newspaper's editorial pages to promote political and social causes of the Progressive Era, especially programs for the poor, child welfare and for women's rights. Desha was not a faithful man during their marriage, and as a result Breckinridge escaped her embarrassment by being busy with her civic activities. She was a patient in a Denver, Colorado sanitarium in 1903 and 1904. About 1904, when she was 32 years of age, she suffered a stroke. =Civic activities= Dixie Selden, Madeline McDowell Breckinridge, 1920, Ashland, The Henry Clay Estate, Lexington, Kentucky She organized a social settlement at Proctor, Kentucky's Episcopal mission with the Gleaners of Christ Church Episcopal from 1899 to 1900. In 1900, she helped found the Lexington Civic League, which created public kindergartens, parks, and recreational opportunities for children, and she also helped found the relief organization, Associated Charities, that year. Breckenridge also worked to have laws enacted regarding child labor, compulsory school attendance, a development of a juvenile justice system in the state (law passed in 1906). She also worked to introduce manual training of domestic science and carpentry in schools, which was funded by the board of education beginning in 1907. Through the efforts of the Lexington Civic League, she founded a social settlement, similar to Chicago's Hull House, named the Lincoln School for Robert Todd Lincoln who donated $30,000 towards the building cost. The school, which opened in 1912, had classrooms for children's day and adult's night classes, swimming pools, gymnasium, a laundry, carpenter shop, cannery, and a community assembly hall. It served poor Lexington residents, including an influx of Irish immigrants, many of whom were illiterate. Breckinridge began working on finding ways to provide services for individuals with tuberculosis in Lexington in 1905, first with the development of a free clinic. She led the efforts within the Associated Charities and Civic League. She founded the Kentucky Association for the Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis in 1912, helped establish the Blue Grass Sanitarium in Lexington, by also working with the Fayette County Tuberculosis Association, and served on the state commission until 1916. Breckinridge chaired the legislative committee of the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs in 1908, 1910, and 1912. She worked hard, among other things, in this role to restore the rights of Kentucky women to vote in school board elections even before the 19th Amendment granted full suffrage. =Equal rights= Frustrated by the lack of influence that she and other women had with state politicians regarding social reform, Breckenridge began lobbying the right for women to vote so they would have a greater voice in the political process. From 1912 to 1915 and 1919 to 1920, Breckinridge served as president of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association. Women were given the right to vote in school elections in 1912, based on her lobbying efforts as legislative chair of the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs. Breckenridge was, between 1913 and 1915, vice president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. She spoke about women's suffrage in several states. Breckenridge was also a member of the Fayette Equal Rights Association, which was a chapter of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association. Its goal was to gain state and federal legislation for women's right to vote. A \\"leading political figure\\", she was involved with the Woman's Democratic Club of Kentucky. Madeline McDowell Breckinridge stands behind (second from the right) Governor Edwin P. Morrow as he signs Kentucky's ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ratified in Kentucky on January 6, 1920. Breckinridge campaigned across the country for the Democratic party and she voted in the November 1920 United States presidential election. She turned her efforts, then, on forming the state League of Women Voters from the Kentucky Equal Rights Association. Breckinridge was also a vocal supporter for the League of Nations. =Death and legacy= Breckinridge had been suffering from health problems, including tuberculosis. She had a stroke and died on Thanksgiving Day, 1920 at the age of 48. She was busy on that day preparing donations for the poor. Her papers are held at the University of Kentucky Libraries. Breckinridge, named one of the Kentucky Women Remembered in 1996, was \\"regarded by some as militant, was one of Kentucky's most active suffragists and a fervent supporter of the Nineteenth Amendment.\\" She married Lexington Herald editor Desha Breckinridge and together they advocated women's rights in the newspaper with arguments that delineate Kentucky's progressive ideals in this time period. Her portrait is a permanently hung in the capitol's \\"Kentucky Women Remembered\\" display. Publications  - accessible online via the Kentucky Woman Suffrage Project on the H-Kentucky network.

The municipality of Treviolo contains the frazioni (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) Curnasco, Albegno, and Roncola: Curnasco is the most populated. Treviolo borders the following municipalities: Bergamo, Bonate Sopra, Bonate Sotto, Curno, Dalmine, Lallio.  History  The first human settlements in the area were probably the Ligurian tribes, as evidenced by the name \\"Curnasco\\", where the suffix \\"-asco\\" is a characteristic feature of those populations. In the Roman period, the residential nucleus developed considerably; given the proximity to Bergamo, it is assumed that those settlements were military outposts for the city. At the end of Roman domination, it is thought that Treviolo, Albegno and Curnasco went through a phase of depopulation, which ended with the arrival of the Lombards, who established Curnasco, cited in documents of the year 774. Of the 871 are the acts which refer to Albineas (later translated as early as 964 in Albigna), while Trevilio appears in papers dating back to 910 (only in 1174 would it appear as Triviliolo). During this time, the entire area was ruled by the Holy Roman Empire, whose rulers instituted feudalism. Those entrusted to the Bishop of Bergamo territories of Treviolo already in the 12th century, but their proximity to the capital made them particularly vulnerable areas for the Guelph and Ghibelline factions, which sought to take control. The fighting reached its climax in 1405, when Treviolo was subjected to a violent attack perpetrated by the Colleoni, a Guelph family of Trezzo, which destroyed buildings and killed many inhabitants sided with the enemy faction. The situation returned to normal only at the beginning of the 15th century, when the Republic of Venice, thanks to a series of targeted interventions, managed to restore a balance by putting an end to the social struggles and lifting the economy, promoting agricultural development. This development occurred despite the land not being particularly fertile (because of the alluvial and gravel nature; it was remedied by creating a series of small irrigation canals. Following this, even the fraction of Roncola was developed. In 1927, the comune took its present size, when Treviolo joined other fractions. However, Curnasco tried to regain self-government many times in the second half of the 20th century, though without success.  Sport Events  On 6 January, every year, in the fraction of Roncola at parco Callioni, is held the \\"Maratona sul Brembo\\", regular race of FIDAL.

Varifolds generalize the idea of a rectifiable current, and are studied in geometric measure theory. Historical note Varifolds were first introduced by Laurence Chisholm Young in , under the name \\"generalized surfaces\\".In his commemorative papers describing the research of Frederick Almgren, writes that these are \\"essentially the same class of surfaces\\".See also the 2015 unpublished essay of Wendell Fleming. Frederick J. Almgren Jr. slightly modified the definition in his mimeographed notes and coined the name varifold: he wanted to emphasize that these objects are substitutes for ordinary manifolds in problems of the calculus of variations. exactly writes:-\\"I called the objects \\"varifolds\\" having in mind that they were a measure-theoretic substitute for manifolds created for the variational calculus\\". As a matter of fact, the name is a portmanteau of variational manifold. The modern approach to the theory was based on Almgren's notesThe first widely circulated exposition of Almgren's ideas is the book : however, the first systematic exposition of the theory is contained in the mimeographed notes , which had a far lower circulation, even if it is cited in Herbert Federer's classic text on geometric measure theory. See also the brief, clear survey by . and laid down by William K. Allard, in the paper . Definition Given an open subset \\\\Omega of Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^n, an m-dimensional varifold on \\\\Omega is defined as a Radon measure on the set :\\\\Omega \\\\times G(n,m) where G(n,m) is the Grassmannian of all m-dimensional linear subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space. The Grassmannian is used to allow the construction of analogs to differential forms as duals to vector fields in the approximate tangent space of the set \\\\Omega. The particular case of a rectifiable varifold is the data of a m-rectifiable set M (which is measurable with respect to the m-dimensional Hausdorff measure), and a density function defined on M, which is a positive function Œ∏ measurable and locally integrable with respect to the m-dimensional Hausdorff measure. It defines a Radon measure V on the Grassmannian bundle of ‚Ñùn :V(A) := \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_{M,A}}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta(x) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathcal{H}^m(x) where *\\\\Gamma_{M,A}=M \\\\cap \\\\\\\\{x : (x, \\\\mathrm{Tan}^m(x,M)) \\\\in A \\\\\\\\} * \\\\mathcal{H}^m(x) is the m‚àídimensional Hausdorff measure Rectifiable varifolds are weaker objects than locally rectifiable currents: they do not have any orientation. Replacing M with more regular sets, one easily see that differentiable submanifolds are particular cases of rectifiable manifolds. Due to the lack of orientation, there is no boundary operator defined on the space of varifolds.

In 1968 Almgren used a combination of varifolds, integral currents, flat chains and Reifenberg's methods in an attempt to extend Reifenberg's celebrated 1960 paper to elliptic integrands.

History and revival Georgian King Luarsab II of Kartli depicted in a chokha The chokha was in wide use among Georgians from the 9th century until the 1920s, when it declined during the Soviet Era.Abashidze, Irakli. Ed. Georgian Encyclopedia. Vol. IX. Tbilisi, Georgia: 1985. It is still used in Georgia as a symbol of national pride, and is frequently worn by Georgian men at weddings and official functions. Worn by Georgians for more than a thousand years, the high-necked wool coat was rarely seen during Soviet rule, but now, for many, it symbolizes pride in the country's past and resistance to its occupation. Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ordered high-ranking Georgian officials working abroad to present themselves in national costumes, including the chokha, at official meetings. The chokha has also been adopted by high fashion designers in Georgia. Types Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili (right) standing next to Georgian ambassador to Japan who is wearing white Chokha during the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito. There are four types of chokha: the Kartl-Kakheti chokha (Kartli and Kakheti are eastern Georgian provinces), the Khevsur chokha (mainly in the Mtskheta-Mtianeti province of Georgia), the Adjarian chokha (mainly found in western Georgian provinces such as Adjara and Guria, previously also in Lazona), and the general Caucasian chokha. The Caucasian chokha originated in the CaucasusAbashidze, Irakli. Ed. Georgian Encyclopedia. Vol. IX. Tbilisi, Georgia: 1985 in the mountainous areas of Georgia. The word chokha entered the Georgian language from Persian. Originally, in Georgia, the garment was referred to as talavari, but later on, after the Persian invasions, Persians started to call Georgian national dress chokha (meaning 'outfit made of fabric'). Russians and Ukrainians called it a cherkeska (meaning 'of/from Circassia'), and the Kuban Cossacks adopted it as part of their costume. In Circassian languages, the chokha is known as shwakh-tsia which means 'covers the horseman', or simply tsia, meaning 'from fabric', and fasha, which means 'fits you'. In Georgia, special decorations, in addition to the talavari/chokha, were adopted by the Order of Chokhosani, who represented an elite cadre of generals, war heroes and famous poets. The chokha is sewn from thick fabric and flares out at the bottom. In some parts of the Caucasus there are also female chokhas. In the late 19th century and early 20th century there were three types of chokhas: the Khevsur chokha, the Kartl-Kakheti chokha and general Caucasian chokha. = Khevsurian chokha = Khevsureti chokhas The Khevsur chokha was worn in the Khevsureti province of Georgia in the Greater Caucasus mountains. The Khevsur chokha is considered to be the closest to the medieval version of the chokha. It is mostly short, with trapezoid shapes. The front side of the chokha has rich decorations and slits on the sides, which extend to the waist. The Khevsur chokha has rich decorations made up of crosses and icons. = Kartli-Kakheti chokha = Georgian cavalry wearing a Kartli-Kakheti chokha The Kartli-Kakheti chokha is longer than the Khevsur chokha and has triangle-like shapes on the chest, exposing the inner cloth called arkhalukhi. It tends to have (locally called masri) on both sides of the chest-spaces. The skirt usually has slits on the sides. People wear them without belts. The Kartli-Kakheti chokha has long sleeves and is usually black, dark red or blue. This is the most popular chokha up to date, often seen in official meeting and musical performance. = General Caucasian chokha = The general Caucasian chokha shares similarities with the Kartl-Kakheti version. In most cases, different decorations fill the bullet spaces. This type of chokha has black leather belts decorated with silver pieces. It is usually a longer version of the Kartl-kakheti Chokha. The general Caucasian chokha is usually made of black, grey, white, blue, red or brown fabric. Among Azeris, it is considered part of the traditional outfit for the performers of mugham, an Azeri folk music genre. Traditionally a person's age determines the colour of their chokha. Generally, the chokha outfit includes a khanjali dagger, an akhalukhi shirt worn under the chokha, masrebi (, bullet/charge holders), and a kabalakhi (bashlyk, a hood, separate from the robe) or nabdis kudi (papakha, a tall fur hat).

He previously played for Isthmian League Premier Division side Hampton & Richmond Borough, as well as for Barnet, Chesham United, Darlington, Dagenham & Redbridge, Thurrock, Bournemouth, Cambridge United, Luton Town and Leeds United in England, and Albacete in Spain. He usually celebrates his goals with a somersault, like his cousin Lomana Tresor LuaLua. Kandol became known as Kandola in Spain.Antonio Calderon: ‚ÄúMy goal is to give stability to the team and getting a comfortable position‚Äù. lacerca.com (23 September 2010). Club career =Early career= Kandol started his career at Luton Town where he was voted young player of the year twice, broke the record of the youngest player to play in the first team and then went to Bournemouth, where he scored once in the Football League Trophy against future club Barnet. He then dropped to non league football and became a highly prolific goalscorer at Thurrock, his tally of 79 goals in 110 games got him noticed back at a higher level of football and he joined Dagenham & Redbridge in the conference where he scored 9 goals in 13 games and subsequently had a successful loan spell back in league football at Darlington. =Barnet= On 18 November 2006, Kandol scored an injury time winner against Rochdale at Underhill to complete his hat-trick that also saw Barnet win their third consecutive league game. Kandol's impact for Barnet saw him topping up the chart as the top scorer in F.A. Cup with 6 goals to his name, he highlighted himself by scoring by lobbing the goalkeeper from the halfway line against Cardiff City and a header to take them out of the cup, followed by another two against Cheltenham Town but his best performance came from Elland Road where he scored a powerful header. A string of good performances attracted the attention of several Championship clubs such as Crystal Palace, Cardiff City, Watford, Hull City and Leeds United. Whilst at Barnet in 2006, Kandol was sent to prison for 13 weeks for a series of driving offences.Barnet's Kandol handed jail term, 14 June 2006. BBC News (2006-06-14). Retrieved 14 July 2012. =Leeds United= After scoring 18 goals from 21 games for Barnet at the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Kandol joined Championship club Leeds United in a two-month loan deal on 23 November 2006. He made his debut two days later as a substitute replacing Robbie Blake in the 2‚Äì1 victory over Plymouth Argyle. His full home debut came with a debut goal in front of his new fans against Barnsley. When the January 2007 transfer window opened, his move to Elland Road was made permanent by Dennis Wise for an initial fee of ¬£320,000. After Leeds were relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history, Kandol scored a last- minute winner against Tranmere Rovers in the opening game of the 2007‚Äì08 League One season. He formed a successful strike partnership with Jermaine Beckford in the first half of the season, winning him player of the August and September month award but loss of form and the arrival of Dougie Freedman meant Kandol lost his place in the starting eleven despite scoring 15 goals, as Leeds went on to reach the playoffs. He was a second-half substitute as Leeds lost 1‚Äì0 in the final against Doncaster Rovers. Leeds signed forwards Luciano Becchio and Enoch Showunmi during the 2008 close season, and Kandol was allowed to join Millwall on loan until January 2009. He opened the scoring just 13 seconds into his \\"Lions\\" debut, but his new club lost 4‚Äì3 at Oldham Athletic. In September, he was sent off in the last few seconds for a bad tackle on Leicester City's Michael Morrison, then marked his return from the resultant three-match ban by scoring twice in the first 12 minutes against Tranmere Rovers. Following that, Kandol then went on to score another two against Bristol Rovers, one at Carlisle, and one against Huddersfield winning him several man of the match awards, becoming top scorer at the club and helping Millwall to rise to 2nd in the League. After his loan expired, he went straight back out on loan again, joining Championship side Charlton Athletic on 30 January 2009 until the end of the season. His first and only goals for the club came in a losing cause against Watford after a successful loan spell in a struggling club, Charlton made an offer of ¬£400,000 for Kandol's services the next season but were turned down due to his transformation in form gathering the attention of Leeds manager Simon Grayson who now wanted to include him in his club's plans. Before the 2009‚Äì10 season, Kandol was told he had no future at Leeds, but after playing well for the reserve team ‚Äì he scored a hat-trick in a 6‚Äì1 defeat of Scunthorpe United's reserves ‚Äì and when given an opportunity in the Football League Trophy, he returned to the league team in place of the injured Becchio against Norwich City on 19 October. Two weeks later, he came on as a late substitute to score the last of Leeds' four goals against Yeovil Town but was charged with violent conduct in an incident after the final whistle and received a three-match ban. He scored against Bristol Rovers, Kettering and Darlington, all by coming off the bench, but still didn't seem enough for the manager. His season was interrupted by injury, and he made infrequent appearances from the bench until what proved his last game for the club, a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Norwich City. Only 20 seconds after entering the game as a late substitute, he took hold of opponent Darel Russell by the throat, was sent off and received a four-match ban. Kandol was initially made available on a free transfer after several meetings with Leeds boardroom staff he decided the time was right for him to look for new challenge. On 4 August 2010 the decision was made by Kandol and his representatives to leave the club by mutual consent. =Albacete= After becoming a free agent and able to sign for a club outside the transfer window on 5 September Kandol signed for Spanish second division side Albacete. However, his spell in Spain was short lived because of injuries and he left the club by mutual consent in November 2010 after the club President described him as great lad with superb sense of humour. In August 2011, Kandol held talks with League 2 side Plymouth Argyle about joining the club. However, after seemingly agreeing terms on a one-year contract he failed to turn up to training as arranged on 4 August and a scheduled press conference. As of 5 August 2011, Plymouth Argyle manager Peter Reid are unsure of Kandol's whereabouts and whether the deal will be signed. In interview, Reid was understandably frustrated and stated that the club had sent a car to the railway station to collect Kandol, but he was \\"a no show\\". =Hampton & Richmond= In October 2012, Kandol signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Hampton & Richmond Borough. Kandol was released on 30 November when Hampton & Richmond Borough said they could no longer afford Kandol's wages. International career Kandol won his first cap for the Congo DR national team in 2008. Personal life Kandol was born in Banga. His cousins, Lomana LuaLua and Kazenga LuaLua have also played professional football. He celebrates scoring a goal by performing a backflip.. He is currently a brand ambassador for Otis Spunkmeyer confectionery.

In 1898 he married Madeline McDowell, who became nationally known as Madeline McDowell Breckinridge. He was a brother of Sophonisba Breckinridge and the son of William Campbell Preston Breckinridge, a member of Congress from Kentucky and a lawyer. His grandfather was the abolitionist minister Robert Jefferson Breckinridge, and his great-grandfather was John Breckinridge. Early life Desha Breckinridge was the son of Issa Desha and William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. His siblings who lived past infancy were Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge (1866‚Äì1948), Mary Curry Breckinridge (1875‚Äì1918), and half-sister Eleanor Breckinridge Chalkley (1862‚Äì1943). Tutored by James Lane Allen as a young man, Breckinridge attended State College (now University of Kentucky) in 1880-81 before he graduated from Lawrenceville School in New Jersey.

Given a parameter Œ∫ and a domain in the complex plane U, it gives a family of random curves in U, with Œ∫ controlling how much the curve turns. There are two main variants of SLE, chordal SLE which gives a family of random curves from two fixed boundary points, and radial SLE, which gives a family of random curves from a fixed boundary point to a fixed interior point. These curves are defined to satisfy conformal invariance and a domain Markov property. It was discovered by as a conjectured scaling limit of the planar uniform spanning tree (UST) and the planar loop-erased random walk (LERW) probabilistic processes, and developed by him together with Greg Lawler and Wendelin Werner in a series of joint papers. Besides UST and LERW, the Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution is conjectured or proven to describe the scaling limit of various stochastic processes in the plane, such as critical percolation, the critical Ising model, the double-dimer model, self-avoiding walks, and other critical statistical mechanics models that exhibit conformal invariance. The SLE curves are the scaling limits of interfaces and other non-self-intersecting random curves in these models. The main idea is that the conformal invariance and a certain Markov property inherent in such stochastic processes together make it possible to encode these planar curves into a one-dimensional Brownian motion running on the boundary of the domain (the driving function in Loewner's differential equation). This way, many important questions about the planar models can be translated into exercises in It≈ç calculus. Indeed, several mathematically non-rigorous predictions made by physicists using conformal field theory have been proven using this strategy. The Loewner equation If D is a simply connected, open complex domain not equal to C, and Œ≥ is a simple curve in D starting on the boundary (a continuous function with Œ≥(0) on the boundary of D and Œ≥((0, ‚àû)) a subset of D), then for each t ‚â• 0, the complement Dt of Œ≥([0, t]) is simply connected and therefore conformally isomorphic to D by the Riemann mapping theorem. If ∆ít is a suitable normalized isomorphism from D to Dt, then it satisfies a differential equation found by in his work on the Bieberbach conjecture. Sometimes it is more convenient to use the inverse function gt of ∆ít, which is a conformal mapping from Dt to D. In Loewner's equation, z is in the domain D, t ‚â• 0, and the boundary values at time t = 0 are ∆í0(z) = z or g0(z) = z. The equation depends on a driving function Œ∂(t) taking values in the boundary of D. If D is the unit disk and the curve Œ≥ is parameterized by \\"capacity\\", then Loewner's equation is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_t(z)}{\\\\partial t} = -z f^\\\\prime_t(z)\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(t)+z}{\\\\zeta(t)-z} or \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial g_t(z)}{\\\\partial t} = g_t(z)\\\\dfrac{\\\\zeta(t)+g_t(z)}{\\\\zeta(t)-g_t(z)}. When D is the upper half plane the Loewner equation differs from this by changes of variable and is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial f_t(z)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{ 2f_t^\\\\prime(z)}{\\\\zeta(t)-z} or \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial g_t(z)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\dfrac{2}{g_t(z)-\\\\zeta(t)}. The driving function Œ∂ and the curve Œ≥ are related by : f_t(\\\\zeta(t)) = \\\\gamma(t) \\\\text{ or } \\\\zeta(t) = g_t(\\\\gamma(t)) where ∆ít and gt are extended by continuity. =Example= Let D be the upper half plane and consider an SLE0, so the driving function Œ∂ is a Brownian motion of diffusivity zero. The function Œ∂ is thus identically zero almost surely and :f_t(z) = \\\\sqrt{z^2-4t} :g_t(z) = \\\\sqrt{z^2+4t} :\\\\gamma(t) = 2i\\\\sqrt{t} :D_t is the upper half-plane with the line from 0 to 2i\\\\sqrt{t} removed.  Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution  Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution is the random curve Œ≥ given by the Loewner equation as in the previous section, for the driving function :\\\\zeta(t)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa}B(t) where B(t) is Brownian motion on the boundary of D, scaled by some real Œ∫. In other words, Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution is a probability measure on planar curves, given as the image of Wiener measure under this map. In general the curve Œ≥ need not be simple, and the domain Dt is not the complement of Œ≥([0,t]) in D, but is instead the unbounded component of the complement. There are two versions of SLE, using two families of curves, each depending on a non-negative real parameter Œ∫: *Chordal SLEŒ∫, which is related to curves connecting two points on the boundary of a domain (usually the upper half plane, with the points being 0 and infinity). *Radial SLEŒ∫, which related to curves joining a point on the boundary of a domain to a point in the interior (often curves joining 1 and 0 in the unit disk). SLE depends on a choice of Brownian motion on the boundary of the domain, and there are several variations depending on what sort of Brownian motion is used: for example it might start at a fixed point, or start at a uniformly distributed point on the unit circle, or might have a built in drift, and so on. The parameter Œ∫ controls the rate of diffusion of the Brownian motion, and the behavior of SLE depends critically on its value. The two domains most commonly used in Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution are the upper half plane and the unit circle. Although the Loewner differential equation in these two cases look different, they are equivalent up to changes of variables as the unit circle and the upper half plane are conformally equivalent. However a conformal equivalence between them does not preserve the Brownian motion on their boundaries used to drive Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution. Special values of Œ∫ *For 0 ‚â§ Œ∫ ‚â§ 4 the curve Œ≥(t) is simple (with probability 1). *For 4 < Œ∫ < 8 the curve Œ≥(t) intersects itself and every point is contained in a loop but the curve is not space-filling (with probability 1). *For Œ∫ ‚â• 8 the curve Œ≥(t) is space-filling (with probability 1). *Œ∫ = 2 corresponds to the loop-erased random walk, or equivalently, branches of the uniform spanning tree. *For Œ∫ = 8/3, SLEŒ∫ has the restriction property and is conjectured to be the scaling limit of self-avoiding random walks. A version of it is the outer boundary of Brownian motion. *Œ∫ = 3 is the limit of interfaces for the Ising model. *Œ∫ = 4 corresponds to the path of the harmonic explorer and contour lines of the Gaussian free field. *For Œ∫ = 6, SLEŒ∫ has the locality property. This arises in the scaling limit of critical percolation on the triangular lattice and conjecturally on other lattices. *Œ∫ = 8 corresponds to the path separating the uniform spanning tree from its dual tree. When SLE corresponds to some conformal field theory, the parameter Œ∫ is related to the central charge c of the conformal field theory by :c = \\\\frac{(8-3\\\\kappa)(\\\\kappa-6)}{2\\\\kappa}.

This was derived by using the martingale property of :h(x,y):=\\\\mathbb{P}[\\\\gamma \\\\text{ passes to the left } x+iy] and It√¥'s lemma to obtain the following partial differential equation for w:=\\\\tfrac{x}{y} :\\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2}\\\\partial_{ww}h(w)+\\\\frac{4w}{w^2+1}\\\\partial_w h=0.

Applications used SLE6 to prove the conjecture of that the boundary of planar Brownian motion has fractal dimension 4/3. Critical percolation on the triangular lattice was proved to be related to SLE6 by Stanislav Smirnov. Combined with earlier work of Harry Kesten, this led to the determination of many of the critical exponents for percolation. This breakthrough, in turn, allowed further analysis of many aspects of this model. Loop-erased random walk was shown to converge to SLE2 by Lawler, Schramm and Werner. This allowed derivation of many quantitative properties of loop-erased random walk (some of which were derived earlier by Richard Kenyon). The related random Peano curve outlining the uniform spanning tree was shown to converge to SLE8. Rohde and Schramm showed that Œ∫ is related to the fractal dimension of a curve by the following relation :d = 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{8}.

It was created in the 1960s by the Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita. It is also known as KJ diagram, after Jiro Kawakita. An affinity diagram is used when: # You are confronted with many facts or ideas in apparent chaos. # Issues seem too large and complex to grasp. =Interrelationship diagram= left Interrelationship diagrams (IDs) displays all the interrelated cause-and-effect relationships and factors involved in a complex problem and describes desired outcomes. The process of creating an interrelationship diagram helps a group analyze the natural links between different aspects of a complex situation. =Tree diagram= left This tool is used to break down broad categories into finer and finer levels of detail. It can map levels of details of tasks that are required to accomplish a goal or solution or task. Developing a tree diagram directs concentration from generalities to specifics. =Prioritization matrix= left This tool is used to prioritize items and describe them in terms of weighted criteria. It uses a combination of tree and matrix diagramming techniques to do a pair-wise evaluation of items and to narrow down options to the most desired or most effective. Popular applications for the prioritization matrix include return on investment (ROI) or cost‚Äìbenefit analysis (investment vs. return), time management matrix (urgency vs. importance), etc. =Matrix diagram or quality table= left This tool shows the relationship between two or more sets of elements. At each intersection, a relationship is either absent or present. It then gives information about the relationship, such as its strength, the roles played by various individuals or measurements. The matrix diagram enables you to analyze relatively complex situations by exposing interactions and dependencies between things. Six differently shaped matrices are possible: L, T, Y, X, C, R and roof-shaped, depending on how many groups must be compared. =Process decision program chart= left A useful way of planning is to break down tasks into a hierarchy, using a tree diagram. The process decision program chart (PDPC) extends the tree diagram a couple of levels to identify risks and countermeasures for the bottom level tasks. Different shaped boxes are used to highlight risks and identify possible countermeasures (often shown as \\"clouds\\" to indicate their uncertain nature). The PDPC is similar to the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) in that both identify risks, consequences of failure, and contingency actions; the FMEA also rates relative risk levels for each potential failure point. =Activity network diagram= left This tool is used to plan the appropriate sequence or schedule for a set of tasks and related subtasks. It is used when subtasks must occur in parallel. The diagram helps in determining the critical path (longest sequence of tasks). The purpose is to help people sequentially define, organize, and manage a complex set of activities.  See also  * Seven basic tools of quality  References   External links  * Brassard, M.

He also won a World Championship bobsleigh medal in 1939. Biography Born in Maidenhead, England, Howard was educated at Mill Hill School.The Author's and Writer's Who's Who (4th ed, 1960) A graduate of the University of Oxford and journalist, Howard captained the England national rugby union team while working with Oswald Mosley during his New Party period. He represented Oxford University RFC in The Varsity Match in 1929 and 1930 and made his England debut against Wales in January 1930 while still at Oxford. He played eight times for England, playing in all four matches in the Five Nations Championship in both 1930 and 1931. He captained England against Ireland at Twickenham in 1931, Ireland winning 6‚Äì5.Griffiths, page 1:25 In 1939 he won the silver medal in the four-man event at the FIBT World Championships in St. Moritz. After a flirtation with Mosley's Blackshirts, he joined the Conservative Party and became a political correspondent and investigative reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express. In 1940, with the Labour Party's future leader Michael Foot and the Liberal Party's Frank Owen, Howard wrote the political polemic, Guilty Men, which is concerned with the UK's appeasement policy and the politicians responsible for it. Meanwhile, Howard had been assigned by Lord Beaverbrook to investigate the 1930s English evangelical movement of American religious leader Frank Buchman Oxford Group later renamed Moral Re-Armament (MRA). Howard interviewed Buchman, eventually leaving the Daily Express and joining the inner circle of Moral Re-Armament. In 1941, he published a book entitled Innocent men, in which he took a different view of the politicians he had lambasted in Guilty Men a year earlier, still sharply questioning the relationship between press and government in wartime Britain, but also expressing his views about the role Moral Re-Armament could play. Moral Re-Armament made the fight against Communism a high priority during and after World War II, considering it a threat to peace and religious freedom. Howard wrote seventeen plays, mostly perceived as both extremely didactic and anti-communist, on the themes of cooperation and dialogue in industrial relations, politics, and personal life. After Buchman died in 1961, Howard was his chosen successor as leader of the worldwide Moral Re-Armament movement. In this work Howard himself travelled extensively. He died of viral pneumonia in Lima, Peru, in February 1965. Howard married 1932 Wimbledon ladies doubles champion Doris Metaxa and they had three children: Anne, Anthony, and The Times journalist Philip Howard (died 5 October 2014, aged 80). Do√´ (Doris) Metaxa Howard was born in Greece on 12 June 1911, but she was raised in Marseilles and represented France at Wimbledon; she died on 7 September 2007, aged 96.

It is considered by some to be a precursor of the cruise missile. Conceptual development Before World War I, the possibility of using radio to control aircraft intrigued many inventors. One of these, Elmer Sperry, succeeded in arousing the US Navy's interest. Sperry had been perfecting gyroscopes for naval use since 1896 and established the Sperry Gyroscope Company in 1910. In 1911, airplanes had only been flying for eight years, and yet Sperry became intrigued with the concept of applying radio control to them. He realized that for radio control to be effective, automatic stabilization would be essential, so he decided to adapt his naval gyro-stabilizers (which he had developed for destroyers). In 1913, the Navy provided a flying boat to test and evaluate the gyro-based autopilot. Sperry's son Lawrence served as an engineer during the test phase. In 1914, Lawrence Sperry was in Europe and observed the developing techniques of aerial warfare, including the use of aircraft. In 1915, the New- York Tribune broke the news of the project. In 1916, the two Sperrys joined Peter Hewitt, an early inventor of radio-related devices, to develop an explosive-laden pilotless airplane. Elmer Sperry and Hewitt served together on the Naval Consulting Board, where they both were members of the Committee on Aeronautics and Aeronautical Motors. Because of these connections, they were able to arrange for a representative of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance, Lt. T. S. Wilkinson, to examine the control equipment they assembled. The system consisted of a gyroscopic stabilizer, a directive gyroscope, an aneroid barometer to regulate height, servo-motors for control of rudders and ailerons, and a device for distance gearing. These all could be installed in an airplane which could be catapulted or flown from the water, and would climb to a predetermined altitude, fly a pre-set course, and after traveling a pre- set distance, drop its bombs or dive to the ground. Wilkinson reported that the weapon did not possess a degree of accuracy sufficient to hit a ship, but, because of its range of 50 to , it might be of interest to the Army. Construction However, after the US declaration of war on Germany, Sperry began urging the Navy to revisit the idea. The Naval Consulting Board supported him, and formally requested the Secretary of Navy to apportion $50,000 for the work. The government thus included the development of the flying bomb or aerial torpedo in its war preparations. The Senate went so far as to establish two classes for the type weapon, one for wireless control, the other for completely automatic operation. Final approval came on May 17, 1917, and the Navy agreed to provide five (later upped to seven) Curtiss N-9 seaplanes and to purchase six sets of the Sperry automatic control gear. Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels agreed to spend $200,000 on the project, with the money to be administered by the Bureau of Ordnance, the Bureau of Construction and Repair and the Bureau of Engineering. The operation was established at Copiague, Long Island. The autopilot equipment was already designed, but the radio control system hadn't been fully developed, so while the hangars were being built at Copiague, Sperry turned his attention to this aspect, purchasing rights to a number of patented radio-related inventions. Ultimately, though, the radio control systems were not used on the Hewitt- Sperry Automatic Airplane. Later, in 1922, the system was installed on several Verville-designed planes along with gear for the Army Air Services engineering division. These aircraft successfully hit their targets from ranges of 30, 60 and . Flight test The first test flights of an autopilot-equipped aircraft was in September, 1917, and took place with a human pilot on board to fly the takeoff. By November, the system successfully flew the aircraft to its intended target at a range, where the distance-measuring gear would drop a bag of sand. Accuracy was within two miles (3 km) of target. Having observed the test flights, Rear Admiral Ralph Earle proposed a program to eliminate the German U-boat threat, one element of which was to use flying bombs, launched from Navy ships, to attack the submarine bases at Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven and Heligoland. Ultimately this plan was rejected, but had an element of prophecy, for in September 1944, during World War II, a modified B-24 flying as a drone attacked the submarine installations at Heligoland. Not only was Earle's recommendation rejected, but the Navy declared that though development of the system was to continue, no production resources were to be diverted to it, and it was not to go into production. Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb When the N-9 flight test program got started, it became apparent that a more efficient airframe was needed. Because war production deliveries could not be diverted, a special, rush order was placed with Curtiss in October, 1917, for six planes of unique design, with an empty weight of , top speed of , range of and the capability of carrying up to of explosives. They became known as the Curtiss- Sperry Flying Bomb. Because this was to be a design dedicated to the remote control concept, the planes were not equipped with seats or standard pilot controls. No flight or wind-tunnel testing of the design was performed before production began. The first was delivered on November 10. One of the most daunting challenges to the designers was the launch mechanism. The original concept envisioned by Hewitt and Sperry was a catapult mechanism or from the water (the N-9s were seaplanes, the Flying Bomb was not). For the Flying Bomb, it was decided to try to launch it by sliding it down a long wire. In November and December 1917, three attempts were made to launch the Flying Bomb. On the first launch, one wing was damaged as the plane went down the wire, and on the second, the plane lifted from the wire but immediately plunged to the ground. The wire method was then abandoned in favor of a traditional catapult with a track, with power obtained from a 3-ton weight being dropped from a height of . On the third try, the plane lagged behind the cart, damaging the propeller, and the plane flipped over its nose. Two more attempts in January, 1918, saw the plane get airborne, but it was too tail-heavy, so it stalled and crashed almost immediately. It was realized that some flight test evaluation of the aircraft's capabilities was necessary. One of the planes was then fitted out with sled runners for landing gear, a seat and standard control stick, and Lawrence Sperry decided that he would be the test pilot. While taxiing it on ice, he hit some slushy snow, and wrecked the plane, though Sperry was unhurt. A second airplane was fitted out, and Sperry managed to get it in the air, but lost control when the automatic pilot was engaged. After two complete rolls, Sperry managed to regain control and land safely. Clearly, though, more attention to flight testing the basic design was needed, particularly in the area of handling qualities. Sperry and his assistant, N. W. Dalton, obtained a Marmon automobile, and mounted the Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb to the top of it. In this configuration, Sperry and his crew drove the Long Island Motor Parkway at , one of the first examples of an open-air wind tunnel, and adjusted the flight controls to what they thought was the optimum settings. The design of the fuselage was changed slightly, lengthening it by two feet. The Marmon was not only an excellent way to adjust the flight controls, it was realized that it would also be a good launching platform, and this was tried on March 6, 1918. The aircraft left the car cleanly, and flew in stable flight for the that the distance-measuring gear had been set for. For the first time in history, an unmanned, heavier-than-air vehicle had flown in controlled flight. The feat, however, could not be duplicated, and it was thought that the roadway was too rough. The Marmon was fitted with railroad wheels, and an unused spur of the Long Island Rail Road, four miles (6 km) east of Farmingdale, New York was put back into service. On the first try, before full flying speed had been reached, the aircraft developed enough lift to raise the front wheels off the track, and another crash resulted. It was time to re- think the catapult system, and to help design it, Sperry and Hewitt hired a young and promising engineer named Carl Norden. The first try with the new system was in August, 1918, and it too resulted in a crash. Two more tests were tried, with the stabilization package that had been design for the Flying Bomb replaced with the four-gyro system used earlier on the N-9 tests, but the result was again a disappointment, with very short flights ending in crashes. On the last one, on September 26, the Flying Bomb climbed straight for about a hundred yards, then entered a spiral dive and crashed. This was the final flight for the Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb, as all the usable airframes had been consumed in crashes, and there remained no confidence in the design. Sperry and Hewitt returned to the N-9. Return of the N-9 The Sperrys built a wind tunnel at the Washington Navy Yard and carried out a series of tests on the N-9, fine tuning the design. On October 17, an unmanned N-9 was launched using the new Norden catapult system. It came cleanly off the track, climbed steadily and flew within 2¬∞ of the line of intended flight. The distance gear had been set for a flight of eight miles (13 km), but somehow malfunctioned. When last seen, the N-9 was cruising over Bayshore Air Station at about , heading east. It was never seen again. Despite the success of the stabilization gear, there was doubt in the Navy about the program, and they asked Carl Norden to review the Sperry components and recommend improvement. The navy was, by now, satisfied with the concept, and was contemplating purchasing such equipment on its own, apart from the Sperrys. Elmer Sperry tried to stir up enthusiasm again, calling the concept of the flying bomb the \\"gun of the future\\". This was to no avail, however. World War I came to a close when the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. Almost a hundred flights had been flown in the N-9, but almost all of these were in the N-9s and had a safety pilot on board. The Navy took complete control of the program from Sperry, spelling the end of the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane. Follow-on programs During the early post-war years, the Navy sponsored similar projects. For the first program, Witteman-Lewis aircraft and Norden- designed gyrostabilizers were used, but the results were no better than those achieved by the Sperrys. In 1921, the program was reoriented to focus on the radio control aspect. The control equipment was developed at the radio laboratory at NAS Anacostia (later the Naval Research Laboratory). In 1923, tests began, and were relatively successful, but interest waned and the project lapsed in 1925. Over a decade was to pass before the Navy seriously undertook the development of target drones and pilotless aircraft.

On the latter date, the government was turned over to Antonio de Mendoza, the first viceroy. Along with Fray Toribio de Benavente Motolinia he built the first European settlement at Puebla, Puebla. Before arriving in the New World, Salmer√≥n earned a doctor of law degree and was counselor to Emperor Charles V. Later he was alcalde of Castilla de Oro, in Central America. After the criminal disaster of the First Audiencia of Mexico City, Emperor Charles V carefully chose five upstanding men to replace them, as the Second Audiencia. The Second Audiencia was named in a royal decree dated January 12, 1530. It was made up of Bishop Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez de Fuenleal as president, and Salmer√≥n, Francisco Ceinos, Alonso de Maldonado and Vasco de Quiroga as oidores. All of these men were honest, honorable and capable. All were licentiates. Bishop Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez de Fuenleal was in Santo Domingo at the time, but the other members of the Audiencia were in Spain. They sailed from Seville on September 16, 1530 and arrived in the port of Veracruz in the early part of 1531. The second Audiencia improved the road from Veracruz to Mexico City, and along the way founded the city of Puebla de los Angeles as a resting-place for travelers (April 16, 1531). It imported horses and cattle from Spain, took steps to import a printing press, founded the Imperial College of Santiago Tlatelolco for higher learning for young Indigenous men, renewed exploration, and continued work on the cathedral of Mexico City. Enslavement of Indians was prohibited in 1532. The Second Audiencia brought suit against the oidores of the First Audiencia Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, Juan Ortiz de Matienzo and Diego Delgadillo. Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was absent from the capital, but the other two corrupt officials were sent back to Spain as prisoners. When Ram√≠rez de Fuenleal decided to found the city of Puebla as a resting place for travelers between Veracruz and Mexico City, Fray Toribio and Oidor Salmer√≥n were chosen commissioners for the task. Together with a large number of Indian laborers, they built the city. Fray Toribio said the first Catholic Mass there, on 16 April 1531. Salmer√≥n was also involved in the repartimientos de tierras (divisions of lands) in the Valley of Atlixco surrounding Puebla. The first repartimiento occurred on December 5, 1532, to 34 Spanish settlers. Salmer√≥n made the division, in the presence of and with the consent of Indigenous chiefs (Don Pedro, Se√±or of Huejotzingo, Don Juan, governor of the same place, Don Pedro, Se√±or of Calpan and Atlixco, and \\"many other se√±ors and principals of the named pueblos\\"). Witnesses included Fray Jacobo de Testera, of the convent of Huejotzingo, Notary Public Francisco de Ordu√±a and Fray Diego de la Cruz of Cholula. In August 1531, Lic. Salmer√≥n solicited special privileges for the new settlement of Puebla. The Spanish Crown granted it the name \\"Puebla de Los Angeles\\", and also granted the settlers an exemption from personal and business taxes for 30 years. These privileges were granted in a royal decree dated March 20, 1532.

Retrieved on September 24, 2009. First used in World War I, air-dropped torpedoes were used extensively in World War II, and remain in limited use. Aerial torpedoes are generally smaller and lighter than submarine- and surface-launched torpedoes. Historically, the term \\"aerial torpedo\\" meant flying bombs and pilotless drone aircraft used as weapons, which would today be called cruise missiles.Hughes, Thomas Parke. American genesis: a century of invention and technological enthusiasm, 1870‚Äì1970, p. 127. University of Chicago Press, 2004. Today, the term refers primarily to water-borne torpedoes launched from the air. History =Origins= In 1915, Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske conceived of the aerial torpedo. The idea of dropping lightweight torpedoes from aircraft was conceived in the early 1910s by Bradley A. Fiske, an officer in the United States Navy.Hopkins, Albert Allis. The Scientific American War Book: The Mechanism and Technique of War, Chapter XLV: Aerial Torpedoes and Torpedo Mines. Munn & Company, Incorporated, 1915 A patent for this was awarded in 1912.Hart, Albert Bushnell. Harper's pictorial library of the world war, Volume 4. Harper, 1920, p. 335. Fiske worked out the mechanics of carrying and releasing the aerial torpedo from a bomber, and defined tactics that included a night-time approach so that the target ship would be less able to defend itself. Fiske imagined the notional torpedo bomber would descend rapidly in a sharp spiral to evade enemy guns, then at an altitude of about would level off long enough to line up with the torpedo's intended path. The aircraft would release the torpedo at a distance of from the target. In 1915, Fiske proposed attacking enemy fleets within their own harbors using this method,The New York Times, July 23, 1915. \\"Torpedo Boat That Flies. Admiral Fiske Invents a Craft to Attack Fleets in Harbors\\" Retrieved on September 29, 2009. if there was enough water (depth and expanse) for the torpedo to run. However, the United States Congress appropriated no funds for aerial torpedo research until 1917 when the U.S. entered into direct action in World War I. The U.S. would not have special-purpose torpedo planes until 1921. =First torpedo aircraft= Meanwhile, the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) began actively experimenting with this possibility. The first successful aerial torpedo drop was unofficially performed by the later RFC pilot Charles Gordon Bell on 27 July 1914 - dropping a Whitehead torpedo from a Short S.64 seaplane. Gordon Bell was followed the next day by RNAS pilot Arthur Longmore, when officially testing an aerial torpedo. The success of these experiments led to the construction of the first purpose-built operational torpedo aircraft, the Short Type 184, built from 1915.GlobalSecurity.org. Military. TB Torpedo Bomber. T Torpedo and bombing. Retrieved on September 29, 2009. An order for ten aircraft was placed, and 936 aircraft were built by ten different British aircraft companies during the First World War. The two prototype aircraft were embarked upon HMS Ben-my-Chree, which sailed for the Aegean on 21 March 1915 to take part in the Gallipoli campaign. Around the same time of the Royal Navy experiments, in Italy Captain Alessandro Guidoni of the Regia Marina was conducting similar trials since 1913, with the help of inventor Ra√∫l Pateras Pescara, and in February 1914 successfully dropped an 800 lb torpedo, leading to disputes over which country first used an aerial torpedo. =First World War= The Short Type 184 was the first torpedo aircraft when built in 1915. In November 1914, Germans were reportedly experimenting at Lake Constance with the tactic of dropping torpedoes from a Zeppelin.The Stansead Journal, February 14, 1915. \\"Now Aerial Torpedo: Deadly Weapon Offered Navy Department.\\" Retrieved on September 29, 2009. In December 1914, Squadron Commander Cecil L'Estrange Malone commented following his participation in the Cuxhaven Raid that \\"One can well imagine what might have been done had our seaplanes, or those which were sent out to attack us, carried torpedoes or light guns.\\"Gardiner, Ian. The Flatpack Bombers: The Royal Navy and the Zeppelin Menace, Pen and Sword, 2009. On 12 August 1915 a Short Type 184, piloted by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds, was the first aircraft in the world to attack an enemy ship with an air-launched torpedo. Operating from in the Aegean Sea, Edmonds took off with a , torpedo to fly over land and sank a Turkish supply ship in the Sea of Marmara. Five days later, a Turkish steamship was sunk by a torpedo aimed again by Edmonds. His formation mate, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, sank a Turkish tugboat after being forced to land on the water with engine trouble. Dacre taxied toward the tugboat, released his torpedo and was then able to take off and return to Ben-My- Chree.Bruce, J.M. \\"The Short Seaplanes: Historic Military Aircraft No. 14: Part 3\\". Flight, 28 December 1956, p. 1000Spaight, J. M. Air Power in the Next War, pp. 25‚Äì27. London, Geoffrey Bles, 1938. A limitation to using the Short more widely as a torpedo bomber was that it could only take off carrying a torpedo in conditions of perfect flying weather and calm seas, and, with that load, could only fly for a little more than 45 minutes before running out of fuel. On May 1, 1917, a German seaplane loosed a torpedo and sank the British steamship Gena off Suffolk. A second German seaplane was downed by gunfire from the sinking Gena. German torpedo bomber squadrons were subsequently assembled at Ostend and Zeebrugge for further action in the North Sea. Later in 1917, the U.S. Navy began to perform trials using a dummy torpedo that, in the first test, porpoised from the water back into the air and almost hit the aircraft that dropped it. Several British torpedo bombers were built, including the Sopwith Cuckoo, the Short Shirl and the Blackburn Blackburd, but a squadron was assembled so late in the war that it achieved no successes. =Interwar years= Breakaway wooden fins help stabilize the torpedo in the air. They grip the metal fins only by friction, and are forced off on entry into the water. The Type 91 torpedo's various Kyoban jettisonable water-entry fin designs. The United States bought its first 10 torpedo bombers in 1921, variants of the Martin MB-1. The squadron of U.S. Navy and Marine fliers was based at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. General Billy Mitchell suggested arming the torpedo bombers with live warheads as part of Project B (the anti- ship bombing demonstration) but the Navy was only curious about aerial bomb damage effects. Instead, a trial using dummy heads on the torpedoes was carried out against a foursome of battleships steaming at 17 knots. The torpedo bombers scored well.Johnson, Vice Admiral Alfred W., Retired. (1959) The Naval Bombing Experiments, Off the Virginia Capes, June and July 1921. Navy Department Library. In 1931, the Japanese Navy developed the Type 91 torpedo, intended for a torpedo bomber to drop from a height of and a speed of . In 1936, the torpedo was given wooden attachments to the tail, nicknamed the Kyoban, to increase its aerodynamic qualities‚Äîthese attachments were shed upon hitting the water. By 1937, with the addition of a breakaway wooden damper at the nose, the torpedo could be dropped from and a speed of . Tactical doctrine determined in 1938 that the Type 91 aerial torpedo should be released at a distance of from the target.Peattie, 2007, pp. 143‚Äì144. As well, the Japanese Navy developed night attack and massed day attack doctrine, and coordinated aerial torpedo attacks between land- and carrier-based torpedo bombers. The Japanese divided their bomber squadrons into two groups so they could attack an enemy battleship from both frontal quarters and make it difficult for the target to avoid the torpedoes by maneuvering, and more difficult for it to direct anti-aircraft fire at the bombers. Even so, Japanese tactical experts predicted that, against a battleship, the attacking force would score hits at only one-third the rate achieved during peacetime exercises. Beginning in 1925, the United States began designing a special torpedo for purely aerial operations. The project was discontinued and revived several times, and finally resulted in the Mark 13 torpedo, which went into service in 1935.Navweaps.com. United States of America: Torpedoes of World War II. 22.4\\" (56.9 cm) Mark 13. Retrieved on September 29, 2009. The Mark 13 differed from aerial torpedoes used by other nations in that it was wider and shorter. It was slower than its competitors but it had longer range. The weapon was released by an aircraft traveling lower and slower ( high, than its Japanese contemporary. =World War II= On the night of November 11‚Äì12, 1940, Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers of the British Fleet Air Arm sank three Italian battleships at the Battle of Taranto using a combination of torpedoes and bombs. In the course of the chase of the German battleship Bismarck, torpedo strikes were attempted in very bad seas, and one of these damaged her rudder allowing the British fleet to catch her. The standard British airborne torpedo for the first half of World War II was the 18-inch Mark XII, a 450 mm- diameter design weighing with an explosive charge of of trinitrotoluene (TNT).Campbell, 2002, p. 87. German aerial torpedo development lagged behind other belligerents‚Äîa continuation of neglect of the category during the 1930s. At the beginning of World War II, Germany was making only five aerial torpedoes per month, and half were failing in air-drop exercises. Instead, Italian aerial torpedoes made by Fiume were purchased, with 1,000 eventually delivered.Campbell, 2002, pp. 260‚Äì262. Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bomber takes off from the aircraft carrier Zuikaku during the Battle of the Coral Sea. In August 1941, Japanese aviators were practicing dropping torpedoes in the shallow waters of Kagoshima Bay, testing improvements in the Type 91 torpedo and developing tactics for the attack of ships in harbor. They discovered that the Nakajima B5N torpedo bomber could fly , somewhat faster than expected, without the torpedoes striking the bottom of the bay down. On December 7, 1941, the leading wave‚Äî40 B5Ns‚Äîused the tactic to score more than 15 hits during the attack on Pearl Harbor. In April 1942, Adolf Hitler made the production of aerial torpedoes a German priority, and the Luftwaffe took the task over from the Kriegsmarine. The quantity of available aerial torpedoes outstripped usage within a year, and an excess of aerial torpedoes was on hand at the end of the war. From 1942 to late 1944, about 4,000 aerial torpedoes were used, but some 10,000 were manufactured during the whole war. Torpedo bombers were modified Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 aircraft, but the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft was successfully tested as a delivery system. Deficiencies in German-designed torpedoes after the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 were addressed just over a year before, through the yanagi visit of Japanese submarine I-30 in August 1942, to supply the Wehrmacht with the Type 91 torpedo's technology and blueprints, to be made in Germany itself as the Lufttorpedo LT 850. The Mark 13 torpedo was the main American aerial torpedo, yet it was not perfected until after 1943 when tests showed that it failed in 70 percent of the drops made from aircraft traveling faster than . Like the Japanese Type 91, the Mark 13 was subsequently fitted with a wooden nose covering and a wooden tail ring, both of which sheared off when it struck the water. The wooden shrouds slowed it and helped it retain its targeting direction through the duration of the air drop. The nose covering absorbed enough of the kinetic energy from the torpedo hitting the water that recommended aircraft height and speed were greatly increased to high at . In 1941, development began in the United States on the FIDO, an electric-powered air-dropped acoustic homing torpedo intended for anti- submarine use. In the United Kingdom, the standard airborne torpedo was strengthened for higher aircraft speeds to become the Mark XV, followed by the Mark XVII. For carrier aircraft, the explosive charge remained of TNT until later in the war when it was increased to of the more powerful Torpex. During World War II, U.S. carrier-based torpedo bombers made 1,287 attacks against ships, 65% against warships, and scored hits 40% of the time. However, the low, slow approach required for torpedo bombing made the bombers easy targets for defended ships; during the Battle of Midway, for example, virtually all of the American torpedo bombers‚Äînearly all of the obsolete Douglas Devastator design‚Äîwere shot down by the Japanese.Blair, Clay, Jr., Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1975, p.238. =Korean War= After World War II, anti-aircraft defenses were sufficiently improved to render aerial torpedo attacks suicidal.Zabecki, David T. World War II in Europe: an encyclopedia, Part 740, Volume 2, p. 1123. Taylor & Francis, 1998. Lightweight aerial torpedoes were disposed or adapted to small attack boat usage. The only significant employment of aerial torpedoes was in anti- submarine warfare. During the Korean War the United States Navy successfully disabled the Hwacheon Dam with aerial torpedoes launched from A-1 Skyraiders. =Modern weapons= Since the advent of practical anti-ship missile technology, pioneered in World War II with the MCLOS-guided Fritz X as early as 1943, aerial torpedoes have largely been reduced to use in anti-submarine warfare. Missiles are generally much faster, with longer range, and without the same launch altitude limitation of aerial torpedoes. Some modern aerial anti-submarine torpedoes do have the necessary guidance capability to engage surface vessels, though given the widespread availability of missiles on aircraft and the small, specialized warhead on anti-submarine aerial torpedoes, this is not an option normally considered. At the peak of the Falklands war, however, the Argentine Air Force, in collaboration with the Navy, outfitted an FMA IA 58 Pucar√° prototype, AX-04, with pylons to mount Mark 13 torpedoes. The aim was the possible production of Pucaras as torpedo- carrying aircraft to enhance the anti-ship capabilities of the Argentine air forces. Several trials were performed off Puerto Madryn, but the war was over before the technicians could evaluate the feasibility of the project.Halbritter, Francisco (2004). Historia de la industria aeron√°utica argentina. Volume 1. Asociaci√≥n Amigos de la Biblioteca Nacional de Aeron√°utica, 2004. . As a result of the loss of the role of anti-shipping aerial torpedo in modern naval doctrine, true torpedo bomber units no longer exist in modern armed forces. The most common platform for aerial torpedoes today is the ship-borne anti-submarine helicopter, followed by fixed-wing anti-submarine aircraft such as the American P-3 Orion. Lynx helicopter carrying a MK46 torpedo. The caveat to the above are torpedoes delivered by missiles/rocket systems, designed for anti-submarine warfare. Some designs are a straightforward mating of a rocket-propulsion system to the torpedo with a purely ballistic attack profile, such as the American ASROC. More complex, aerial drone-based system with autopilot have also been deployed, such as the Australian Ikara. Most such systems are designed to deploy from surface ships, though exceptions exist such as the Soviet navy RPK-2 Viyuga, which can be launched from both surface ships and submarines. Given the relatively soft nature of submarines, modern anti-submarine aerial torpedoes are much smaller than anti-ship aerial torpedoes of the past, and often classified as light weight torpedoes. They are also often of cross-platform design, able to deploy from both aircraft and surface ships. Examples include the American Mark 46, Mark 50 and Mark 54 torpedoes. There are few if any aerial torpedo designs that are also used by submarines, owing to the significantly reduced capability of aerial torpedoes compared with their full-sized submarine counterparts such as the American Mark 48 torpedo. Design A successful aerial launched torpedo design needs to account for *The distance it travels through the air before entering the water *The heavy impact with the water The Japanese Type 91 torpedo used Kyoban aerodynamic tail stabilizers in the air. These stabilizers (introduced in 1936) were shed off when it entered the water. And a new control system (introduced in 1941) stabilized the rolling motion by countersteering both in the air and the water. The Type 91 torpedo could be released at speed of 180 knots (333 km/h) from 20 m (66 ft) into shallow water but also at 204 knots (the Nakajima B5N2's maximum speed) into choppy waves of a rather heavy sea.

Granite domes are domical hills composed of granite with bare rock exposed over most of the surface. Generally, domical features such as these are known as bornhardts. Bornhardts can form in any type of plutonic rock but are typically composed of granite and granitic gneiss. As granitic plutons cool kilometers below the Earth's surface, minerals in the rock crystallize under uniform confining pressure. Erosion brings the rock closer to Earth's surface and the pressure from above the rock decreases; as a result the rock fractures. These fractures are known as exfoliation joints, or sheet fractures, and form in onionlike patterns that are parallel to the land surface. These sheets of rock peel off the exposed surface and in certain conditions develop domical structures. Additional theories on the origin of granite domes involve scarp- retreat and tectonic uplift.  Sheet fractures  Sheet fractures are arcuate fractures defining slabs of rock that range from 0.5 to 10 meters thick. They normally form in sets parallel to the Earth's surface but may form in convex- upward or concave-upward sets. There are several possible explanations for the formation of sheet fractures. The most popular hypothesis is that they are the result of expansion and tangential fracturing consequent on erosional offloading or pressure release. There is evidence that supports this hypothesis when looking at granitic landforms that have sheet fractures. Granite forms deep in the Earth's crust under conditions of high ambient or lithostatic pressure. In order for the granite to be exposed at the Earth's surface a considerable thickness of rock must be eroded. This unloading allows the granite to expand radially and sheet fractures form tangentially to the radial stress. This indicates that the shape of the pre-existing land surface determines the geometry of the sheet fractures.  Other theories of origin  One hypothesis is that granite domes are uplifted blocks. This is the case with some granite domes but the fracture related exfoliation joints are what controls the steep slopes. Another theory that regards isolated bornhardts is that they remain after long-distance scarp recession. Moisture related weathering is what causes scarp recession. In the case of granite in a dissected landscape the dry granite high on a slope remains stable and acts as caprock. Granite below this is more easily weathered and eroded because it has been exposed to moisture and has weathered. This ultimately leads to the steepening of the slope and the collapse of higher slope elements as well as the maintenance of scarps of essentially constant inclination and morphology during backwearing.

The facility is about one mile south of New York State Thruway exit 44.Google Map Location History Finger Lakes Racetrack opened on May 23, 1962 as a thoroughbred horse race track. The race track has gone through several ownership changes and a cycle of successful and near-bankrupt seasons. Famous jockeys that have ridden at Finger Lakes include Angel Cordero, Pat Day, Julie Krone, and Bill Shoemaker. Ross Morton, a well-known race caller, was Finger Lakes' announcer from opening day until his death in February 2008. And Tin Cup Chalice, the first winner of the Big Apple Triple Crown of Racing, made his home at Finger Lakes. Unfortunately, Tin Cup Chalice was killed on April 17, 2009 in a freak accident while training at the track. A colt named Zany bolted and collided with him and both horses died. The track as a seasonal business, holding races from spring to fall, was financially hurt with the advent of Off Track Betting in the 1980s. Finger Lakes rebounded in the 1990s when simulcast racing began. Under this system, patrons were able to attend the clubhouse year-round and wager on races at other tracks around the country. In 2004, Finger Lakes Race Track became Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track after a $10.5 million renovation. The largest part of the renovation was the addition of a racino, which is a casino-style video gaming floor. Attendance rose at the facility after the introduction of the racino. Feature Races Finger Lakes is home to the New York Derby, a 1 1/16 mile restricted race for 3 year old horses who have been bred in the state of New York. Carrying a purse of $150,000, the race is a part of the Big Apple Triple, consisting of the Mike Lee Stakes at Belmont Park, the New York Derby, and the Albany Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. The New York Derby race is typically run in July. At this time, Finger Lakes Race Track does not offer any graded stakes.

His main work Principles of Political Economy was published in 1964. Among his scholars are Thomas T. Sekine and Makoto Itoh. Thought Uno based his work on a rigorously Hegelian reading of Marx's Capital. This led him to his well-known conclusion that Marxian analysis had to be conducted at three separate levels: # The \\"pure\\" theory of Capital, freed from the complications of history ‚Äì highly abstract exercises in dialectical logic on the basic, core dynamics of capitalist economy. # A \\"middle\\" level, which traces the general development of capitalism through distinct historical stages ‚Äì mercantilism, classical liberalism and so on. # The analysis of the 'messy' details of capitalist economy in the real world, concentrating on particular narratives rather than an overall picture.Kincaid, 2006 Uno and his followers have come in for criticism from the wider Marxist tradition for insisting on this separation. Simon ClarkeClarke, 1989; Kincaid 2006 sees this schema as \\"scholastic formalism\\", and the second level as an arbitrary addition to provide a link between the other two, rather than an analytically necessary one. As Kincaid points out, though, Capital is primarily a logically rather than chronologically argued work, which looks at the laws of capitalist development and draws mainly supporting evidence from historical data. Thus, the separation of the Uno school represents an acknowledgement of this logical nature, and registers the key problem of how the critique can be linked to actual economic development in a way that competing schools often cannot.

Education Mar Elias educational campus In 1965 Abuna Elias Chacour, an Arab Christian from Kafr Bir'im, later Archbishop of Galilee, established a school open to all local children, regardless of religious affiliation. This developed into the Mar Elias Educational Institutions, an educational complex consisting of a kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, high school. And formerly used to include a college and a university. The educational complex is located on Jabal al-Ghoul (Hill of Demons), on property belonging to the Melkite Church. The hill has been renamed Jabal al-Nour (Hill of Light). \\"Mar Elias University\\" was established in 2003, claiming to be the first Arab university in Israel, though it is not officially holding a University status. It is recognized by the Council for Higher Education in Israel as a campus and operates as a branch of the University of Indianapolis in the United States. But the Israeli government ordered its closure hence it was turned into Mar Elias High School, part of the Mar Elias Educational Institutions. Economy Ibillin historically depended on agriculture, especially the growth of sheets and vegetables (most notably cucumbers). Ibillin is also one of only municipalities in Israel that are allowed to raise pigs and to house pig farms on its land and it exports to multiple Arab Christian and Russian restaurants and factories all thought Israel who sell pork products (most notably the Russian \\"Marcel Brothers - ◊ê◊ó◊ô◊ù ◊û◊®◊°◊ú\\" company based in Haifa).

Fleming played collegiately as a halfback at the University of Iowa, where he was a member of the Hawkeyes' 1959 Rose Bowl championship team. He is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, the BC Sports Hall of Fame, and the BC Lions Wall of Fame. Fleming's number 15 jersey is one of eight numbers retired by the Lions. In 2003, Fleming was voted a member of the BC Lions All-Time Dream Team as part of the club's 50th anniversary celebration. In 2006, Fleming was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL's Top 50 players of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Fleming earned the nickname \\"The Wisp\\" or \\"Will 'o the Wisp\\" because of his elusive running style. High school and college career Fleming played halfback at Hamtramck High School in Detroit, winning All-City honors in 1956. His Head Coach was Babe Dimancheff. In 1957, Fleming began his college career at the University of Iowa, where he was eventually named an Associated Press First Team All-Big Ten player in 1958. In 1958, Fleming helped the Hawkeyes to a 6-0-1 Big Ten clinching victory over the University of Minnesota, and led the team in scoring. In 1959, Fleming and the 7-1-1 Hawkeyes defeated the University of California (and Fleming's future BC Lions teammate, quarterback Joe Kapp) 38‚Äì12, in the 1959 Rose Bowl. Fleming scored 2 rushing touchdowns in the game, and finished with 85 yards on 9 attempts. Professional career Arlene and Willie Fleming in 1960. Following the 1959 Rose Bowl, Fleming joined the Canadian Football League BC Lions for the season. By , he became the first Lion to eclipse 1,000 yards rushing with 1,051 yards on 125 carries for an 8.4 yard average. In , Fleming and Kapp led the Lions to a 12‚Äì4 record and the CFL Western Division championship. The Lions next faced the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 1963 CFL Championship Grey Cup. During the 1963 Grey Cup game, Fleming was involved in a widely discussed and controversial play as he was hit by Ti-Cat defensive lineman Angelo Mosca, while Fleming was out of bounds, resulting in Fleming's absence from the remainder of the game (and a trip to the hospital). Despite a disappointing end to the season (the Lions lost to the Tiger-Cats, 21-10), Fleming had his finest season as a professional football player, as he rushed for 1,234 yards on 127 carries for an incredible 9.7 yard average. The following year, Fleming and the Lions would get their revenge, as the BC Lions again faced the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 1964 Grey Cup. The Lions won their first CFL championship 34‚Äì24, and Fleming scored a game-breaking touchdown on a 68-yard scoring run over Mosca's position. Earlier in the season, Fleming scored the longest touchdown run from scrimmage (109 yards) against the Edmonton Eskimos, a CFL record that still stands. Fleming retired from the CFL and the BC Lions following the season. Fleming retired as a CFL All-Star in , a three-time CFL Western Division All-Star, and was named the most popular BC Lions Player three times. After sitting out the 1967 season, Fleming attempted a comeback with the Minnesota Vikings in 1968, but was released before the regular season began.

One of Poulenc's most celebrated works, it was commissioned by the Koussevitsky Foundation in honor of Sergei Koussevitzky and his wife Natalia, the namesakes of the foundation. Gloria was premiered on 21 January 1961 in Boston, Massachusetts by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Chorus Pro Musica under conductor Charles M√ºnch with Adele Addison as soloist. The first recording (also in 1961), for EMI, was conducted by Georges Pr√™tre, under the supervision of the composer, with Rosanna Carteri as the soloist. Among later recordings of the music, the RCA Victor recording by the Robert Shaw Chorale in 1965 won a Grammy Award for the \\"Best Choral Performance.\\" Movements The work is divided into six movements as follows: # Gloria in excelsis Deo (G major) # Laudamus te (C major) # Domine Deus, Rex caelestis (B minor) # Domine Fili unigenite (G major) # Domine Deus, Agnus Dei (B-flat minor) # Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris (G major) Description The first movement opens with a great chordal motif from the brass instruments that very closely resembles the opening of Igor Stravinsky's Serenade in A for Piano (1925). The chorus then enters singing in an accented and declamatory manner. The introduction begins in G major and modulates to a G minor chord, after which the woodwinds enter in parallel 4ths and 7ths. The chorus enters in double-dotted rhythms, reminiscent of the brass fanfare, in the key of B minor, accompanied by B minor triads over a pedal G in the bass. This juxtaposition of G major and B minor is an important one that returns throughout the piece. The second movement is the most jocund, opening with a strange, quick brass introduction. A light tune repeats throughout this movement along with an often-changing time signature. This movement is in the key of C, with a few diversions throughout. The last line of the text, beginning \\"Gratias agimus...\\" is in a somber chromaticized mode, giving an other-worldly characteristic in the middle of the revelry of the movement. After this respite, there is a diversion to E flat over an \\"oompah\\" bass figure. The accentuation of the text in this movement has been referred to as \\"perverse\\",Mellers, Wilfrid. Francis Poulenc. Oxford University Press, New York: 1993.. due to its un-speechlike patterns. The third movement is led by the extremely dramatic solo soprano line after a woodwind introduction. The movement ends with a picardy third, preparing the way for the more joyful fourth movement. The fourth movement is the shortest and resembles the second movement in the jocular nature of the orchestral phrases, but contains some of the accented nature of the first movement in the chorus parts. The melodic lines are often pentatonic, and the quick tempo and rousing rhythms give a whirling and dancing impression, grounded by the constant return of the theme. The fifth movement opens with woodwinds and resembles the third movement with the return of the soprano soloist as leader. The music is dark and mysterious, due in part to the inclusion of both an augmented fourth and an augmented fifth in the soprano's opening melodic line. The movement culminates in an E-flat minor chord, a fifth lower than the beginning B-flat minor, giving an uneasy, mysterious feeling to the end. Of particular note is the similarity between the clarinet solos of this movement and parts of the first and second movements of Poulenc's later clarinet sonata. The sixth movement begins with alternating a cappella chorus and interjections of the orchestra intoning the fanfare theme from the first movement. After the introduction, the main setting of the text is reminiscent of the first movement, with the sixteenth note toiling line in the upper strings above a walking bass. The final section is preceded by a solo \\"Amen\\" from the soprano, echoed by the chorus. The chorus proceeds to repeat the text, this time over a mixture of B minor and G major chords in the orchestra. The fanfare theme from the first movement returns one final time before the final \\"amen\\", triumphantly slower and grander.

Background Ganz was born on August 18, 1838 in the German town of Walldorf, Thuringia in the then Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, to Jewish parents Meyer and Hannah Ganz. He was educated in his home country before being apprenticed to a tailor at age 14. Ganz immigrated to the United States in 1858, working as a journeyman tailor in New York City and Philadelphia before settling in Cedartown, Georgia. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Ganz enlisted in the Confederate States Army. As a soldier, he saw action at the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, and well as being assigned to the defense of Richmond, Virginia. Toward the end of the war, he was captured and spent seven months as a prisoner of war at Elmira Prison. Becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1866, Ganz moved to Kansas City, Missouri. He joined other cousins who operated a clothing and dry goods company and made alterations to ready made clothing. In 1872, Ganz moved to Las Animas, Colorado where he continued to work as a tailor. There he married a Catholic woman named Elizabeth. Two years later he relocated to Prescott, Arizona Territory and become manager of a hotel. In May 1876, he was granted a divorce from his wife. Ganz moved to Phoenix in 1879 and became proprietor for the Bank Exchange hotel. The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1885, after which Ganz went into the wholesale liquor business. Ganz married Bertha Angleman of Kansas City, Missouri in 1883. The union produced four children: Sylvan C., Julian, Aileen, and Helen. Politically, Ganz was a member of the Democratic party. He was elected Mayor of Phoenix in 1885. As mayor, he lobbied for creation of a city fire department. He was initially unsuccessful but a fire in August 1886 convinced the voters to pass a bond issue to improve water supply and purchase fire fighting equipment. In 1894, Ganz sold his liquor business. The next year he purchased an interest in the National Bank of Arizona and was elected the bank president. He returned to politics in 1896 and was unanimously elected to represent the second ward on the city council. In 1899, Ganz was elected to his first of two consecutive terms as city mayor. He was the Democratic nominee for mayor in 1903 but failed to win reelection. Ganz's wife, Bertha, died on March 20, 1905. Ganz married Elsie Bryson on September 12, 1907. He stepped down as president of the National Bank of Arizona in January 1920 and became Chairman of the bank's board. Ganz died in a San Diego, California hospital on August 6, 1922. In 2001, professional historian Mark Pry wrote a biography of Ganz, Immigrant Banker: The Life of Emil Ganz. The book was commissioned by granddaughter Joan Ganz Cooney, a television producer who co-created the PBS children's series Sesame Street.

In addition to his lengthy work Neotopia, for Antarctic Press, Espinosa has done extensive work adapting and illustrating literary classics into comics form, as well as creating comic book stories of important events from American history. Biography Espinosa was born in the Philippines. He graduated from the Don Bosco technical college with a certificate in architectural drafting and got a degree in advertising art from Santo Tomas University in Manila. He worked for various companies in the fields of advertising, software entertainment and film before finally settling into a life of a comic book author. Espinosa's work on The Courageous Princess at Antarctic Press earnt him a nomination for Promising New Talent and Best Artist for the 2000 Ignatz Awards and a 2002 Eisner Award nomination for Best Title for Younger Readers. As both writer and artist, he authored the Neotopia series (4 volumes, 140 pages each), which was published in graphic novel form. In 2006, Novotopia, the German edition of Neotopia, got a nomination for the Max & Moritz Prize in the category 'Bester Comic f√ºr Kinder' (best comic book for younger audience). His past work include the Battle Girlz series, a manga novel adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, The Alamo, Dinowars and Metadocs. He has also written and conceptualized popular Antarctic Press titles such as I Hunt Monsters and Herc and Thor. His work is also featured in a series of American history comic books dealing with the subjects of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Lewis and Clark, The Boston Tea Party, The Alamo, Jackie Robinson, the Underground Railroad, Abraham Lincoln, Patrick Henry, Cesar Chavez, The American Revolution, the Transcontinental Railroad, and Clara Barton. Espinosa's latest endeavor is creating, developing, drawing, and self-publishing his own game board, titled Adventure Kingdom. The Courageous Princess \\"The Unremembered Lands\\" and The Courageous Princess \\"The Dragon Queen\\", were released in the summer and winter of 2015 respectively. = Humanitarian work = In 2008, Espinosa won an international contest sponsored by the United Nations and the World Health Organization entitled Stop Tuberculosis. The Stop TB comic book educating people about how to avoid Tuberculosis featured Soccer star Luis Figo as the spokesman. In 2009, Espinosa joined 60 other Filipino artists from all over the world and contributed to the tribute book Renaissance: Ang Muling Pagsilang, the sales of which were donated to the victims of typhoon Ondoy. In 2010, Espinosa returned to draw a second book for the United Nations, featuring a \\"dream team\\" of soccer players led by Lu√≠s Figo. Score the Goals features the Millennium Development Goals as outlined by the U.N., WHO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization. =Neotopia= Neotopia is a four-part comic book miniseries (consisting of twenty issues) written and drawn by Espinosa, and published by Antarctic Press. It is set 800 years after the rise of a movement which tried to destroy the capitalist system and build a new, better world. Neotopia features the supposed Grand Duchess of Mathenia, Nalyn, environmentally friendly inventor Philios, the faerie Nimn, the telepathic and telekinetic dolphin Ki-Ek, elven bodyguard Marro, robot warrior Sergeant Tinbolt, the Chiropterian Monti, and Tridactylian professor Felder. In the comic series, the nation of Neotopia is gone, but other nations have sprung up. The comics follow a conflict between Mathenia, which follows the precepts of the Neotopians, and Krossos, which is a dystopian industrial dictatorship, ruled by the inhuman Lord Emperors. The change in humanity resulted in the emergence or re-emergence of various nonhuman civilizations, including wood- elves, the bat-like chiropterans, Dalphinii dolphins, and the alien Tridactylians. The story begins with Princess Nalydania, a woman who orders her serving girl, Nalyn, to impersonate her at all public functions, including lessons. She leaves to attend an important ball in another country. The land of Krossos declares war on Mathenia, and attempts to kidnap the look-alike Nalyn whom they mistake for the actual Princess Nalydania. Nalyn escapes with the help of friends, and searches for allies in the war. In her travels, Nalyn and her friends encounter the humanoid hyena corsairs, the utopian island of Eriden, and a queendom of amazons on the island of Eriland. In the final issue, Nalyn and her allies attack Krossos' fortress capital. Within it, they find substantial amounts of gold, patents to all known devices, and deeds to the entire world. They find the Lord Emperors of Krossos ‚Äî who it is revealed are men who forsook their humanity in order to gain 'perfect' bodies through technology. They desperately offer Nalyn a share of their wealth; 40% of the world, as well as technological immortality, only to discover that she set fire to their library of patents and deeds on the way in. She offers them a choice to surrender and let the old world die, or refuse and die themselves. They refuse, and she leaves, ordering her forces to destroy the palace. The story of Neotopia is decidedly socialist. Its portrayal of the final days of the old world, and most notably of its greatest empire, Elyssion, is harsh. In a series of monologues written from the viewpoint of the Mathenians, Espinosa touches on such issues as capitalist oligarchy, pollution, the lack of community in large cities, slave labour, gender bias, and cruelty to animals and children.

Flower close-up Salvia pratensis, the meadow clary or meadow sage, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to Europe, western Asia and northern Africa. The specific epithet pratensis refers to its tendency to grow in meadows. It also grows in scrub edges and woodland borders. Description Salvia pratensis is an herbaceous perennial forming a basal clump tall, with rich green rugose leaves that are slightly ruffled and toothed on the edges. The stems have four edges and are clad in glandular and soft hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, with those on the lower part of the stem up to long, decreasing in size higher up the stem. The flower stalks are typically branched, with four to six flowers in each verticil forming a lax spike. The flowers open from the base of the inflorescence, which grows up to long. The small calyx is dark brown. The corolla is irregular, long, fused with two lips and long-tubed. The upper lip arches in a crescent shape and the lower lip is three-lobed with the central lobe larger than the lateral lobes. In the wild the corolla is usually bluish- violet. In cultivation, the flowers have a wide variety of colors, from rich violet and violet-blue to bluish white, and from pink to pure white. There are two long stamens protected by the upper corolla lip and the fruit is a four- chambered schizocarp. Distribution and habitat Salvia pratensis is native to Europe, western Asia and northern Africa where it grows in meadows, fields, banks and rough places. It has become naturalized in many parts of the United States, and is considered a noxious weed in the state of Washington. At one time it was banned from California because it was thought to have naturalized in three locations. Cultivation Salvia pratensis is said to be hardy from USDA Zone 3. It is widely grown in horticulture, especially Salvia pratensis subsp. haematodes,Mark Griffiths, Editor. Index of Garden Plants, 2nd American Edition. (Portland, Oregon: Timber Press, 1995. .) which is prized by flower arrangers as a cut flower. Some botanists consider it a separate species, S. haematodes. Named cultivars include:- * 'Atroviolacea', dark blue to violet * 'Baumgartenii', blue to violet * 'Lupinoides', to , white-flecked blue to purple * 'Mitsommer' (\\"Midsummer\\"), sky blue * 'Rosea', rose-pink to purple * 'Rubicunda', rose-red * 'Tenorii', to about tall, blue flowers * 'Variegata', blue and sometimes white-tipped flowers. The cultivar 'Indigo' with violet blue flowers has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Uses The name of the plant 'clary' is derived from 'clear-eye' and the plant seeds were formerly used as a paste to remove particles from the eyes and to reduce inflammation or redness. It was also used as a gargle for sore throats, and to clean teeth. It has also been used as a flavouring for beers and wines.

She finds mention in the Jain texts. Life Trishala was born as a princess in the royal Licchavi Empire. Jain text, UttarapurƒÅ·πáa details the life of all Tirthankaras and other Salakapurusa. It is mentioned in the text that King Chetaka of Vaishali had ten sons and seven daughters. His eldest daughter Priyakarini (Trishala) was married to Siddartha. As per Indologist Hermann Jacobi, Vardhaman Mahavira's mother Trishala was sister of King Chetaka. His third wife, Kshema, was a daughter of the chief of the Madra clan of Punjab.Krishna, Narendra. (1944) History of India, A. Mukherjee & bros. p. 90. Trishala had seven sisters, one of whom was initiated into the Jain monastic order while the other six married famous kings, including Bimbisara of Magadha. She and her husband Siddhartha were followers of Parshva, the 23rd Tirthankara. According to Jain texts, Trishala carried her son for nine months and seven and a half days during the 6th century BC. However, Svetambaras generally believe that he was conceived by Devananda, the wife of a Brahmin Rishabhadatta and was transferred to Trishala's womb by Indra because all Tirthankaras have to be Kshatriyas. All this is mentioned in the Svetambara text, Kalpa sutra, which is primarily a biography of the Tirthankaras. Auspicious dreams Detail of a leaf with, The Birth of Mahavira (the 24th Jain Tirthankara), from the Kalpa Sutra, c. 1375‚Äì1400. Aspicious dreams seen by the Tirthankara mother. According to the Jain scriptures, the mother of Tirthankaras see a number of auspicious dreams when the embryo is enliven through the descent of the life (soul) in the mortal body. This is celebrated as Garbha Kalyanaka. According to the Digambara sect, the number of dreams is 16. While the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara sect believe them to be only fourteen. After seeing these dreams, she woke her husband King Siddhartha and told him about the dreams. The next day Siddhartha summoned the scholars of the court and asked them to explain the meaning of the dreams. According to the scholars, these dreams meant that the child would be born very strong, courageous, and full of virtue. # Dream of an elephant (Airavata) # Dream of a bull # Dream of a lion # Dream of Laxmi # Dream of flowers # Dream of a full moon # Dream of the sun # Dream of a large banner # Dream of a silver urn (Kalasha) # Dream of a lake filled with lotuses # Dream of a milky-white sea # Dream of a celestial vehicle (Vimana) # Dream of a heap of gems # Dream of a fire without smoke # Dream of a pair of fish (Digambara) # Dream of a throne (Digambara) Legacy Today members of the Jain religion celebrate the event of the Dreams.

He was the younger brother of Jonathan Worth, who served as the state's Treasurer and Governor during the 1860s. John Worth served several terms in the North Carolina Senate, representing Moore and Montgomery Counties in the 1840s. Like his older brother, he was a Unionist or Anti-Secessionist until the Civil War broke out, when he became loyal to the Southern cause, serving as an officer in the Confederate military reserves. In 1870, Worth was elected state Senator from Randolph County. In November 1876, he was elected by the people to a four-year term as State Treasurer. His name added strength to the ticket and is credited with helping his fellow Democrats regain power in the state. When incumbent Republican David A. Jenkins resigned before the end of his term, Governor Curtis H. Brogden named Worth to fill the post a few months early. As Treasurer, he faced the difficult task of settling the state's debt on a fair and equitable basis to both the bond holders and the citizens. Worth was re-elected Treasurer in 1880, serving just over four more years. He was highly respected by contemporaries for his service. He once commented upon his guiding philosophy: \\"My earnest wish has been to be useful to the State.\\" After leaving public service, Worth became president of the Bank of Randolph and of the Southern Stock Mutual Fire Insurance Company. His Worth Manufacturing Company operated successful cotton mills in Worthville and Central Falls in Randolph County, not far from where the North Carolina Zoological Park is located today.

Appearance and family Yosser appears as a tall man in his mid-thirties who wears predominantly black clothes and has a distinctive bushy moustache. He always appears unkempt and unshaven. He had a wife called Maureen, an aggressive, unloving harridan who frequently berates him and had an affair with another man, the likely father of their three children (played in the drama by Alan Bleasdale's children). Pilot episode The pilot of Blackstuff implies that Hughes worked in the Middle East at some time during the 1970s and later bought a house that was beyond the family's means. In the original pilot episode, he appears comparatively sane, but displays macho insecurities that make his redundancy especially hard to take. When the boys are swindled out of their savings in Middlesbrough, Yosser reacts particularly badly, showing the first signs of the nervous breakdown that would characterise his behaviour in the 1982 series. The first episode of the series sees Yosser collecting social security from a Liverpool DHSS and making an unexpected appearance at an illegal building site, organised by a corrupt Irish contractor called Molloy. When Molloy takes him to task over a badly built wall, Hughes headbutts him and kicks down the wall, storming off with his much-loved children in tow. Memorable episode In perhaps the most memorable episode of the series, Bleasdale shows the complete disintegration of Yosser's life as his children are taken into care, he is made homeless and finally tries to commit suicide in a lake. Constantly trying to run the gauntlet of psychiatrists, social workers and creditors, Yosser makes numerous pathetic attempts to re-establish his identity and sense of self-worth, at one point gatecrashing a charity event to meet his apparent lookalike Graeme Souness. Yosser eventually ends up courting arrest by smashing a storefront window, then being arrested for head-butting one of the police officers who arrives on the scene. Bleasdale's use of black humour is also apparent in a scene in which a distraught Yosser and his three children enter a confessional where a priest named Fr. Daniel Thomas is listening, and telling him \\"I'm desperate, Father!\\" When the priest tries to calm him and sympathetically urges Yosser to call him Dan, Yosser blurts out the words; \\"I'm desperate, Dan!\\", a play on the comic character, Desperate Dan. Bleasdale admitted on 2 September 2011 on Radio 4's programme \\"Reunion\\" that he had been saving that joke for years, but it was the perfect joke at the perfect time. Final episode In the final episode, Yosser pays a visit to George Malone, possibly the only person to treat him with any degree of understanding, although George is now too ill to offer anything more than token advice. He has been taken in by his mother and there seems little chance that he will see his children again. Yosser attends George's funeral and loudly sniggers at the priest's banal eulogy. In the pub afterwards, he raises a cheer when he headbutts a vicious former bouncer into unconsciousness. In the very final scene, as three of the main characters watch a controlled demolition of a Tate and Lyle factory, Yosser's hopeless refrain of \\"gizza job\\" is almost a requiem for the old working-class community that is being destroyed. Popular references The series tackled the subject of unemployment. Yosser became an icon of Thatcherite Britain in the 1980s with his catchphrase of \\"Gizza job\\" (\\"give us [me] a job\\").

Her notable collection was bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Early life and education Joan Evans was born at Nash Mills, Apsley, Hertfordshire, the daughter of antiquarian and businessman Sir John Evans and his third wife, Maria Millington Lathbury (1856‚Äì1944). She was half-sister to Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos and discoverer of Minoan civilisation. Sir Arthur was forty two years her senior: he caused huge hilarity at an antiquarian conference of learned and erudite gentlemen when he brought in a four-year-old Joan to be \\"shown off\\". Evans was educated privately before going up to St Hugh's College, Oxford to read Archaeology. She graduated in 1916 as M.A.. In 1930 she was awarded a D.Litt.. Scholarship The Royal Institution of Great Britain's records suggest that Evans was the first woman to give a Friday Evening Discourse at the Institution: this was on 8 June 1923, the title being \\"Jewels of the Renaissance\\". In 1950, Evans's book Cluniac Art of the Romanesque Period, which concerned art and sculptures made by the monks of the abbey at Cluny in eastern France, was published by Cambridge University Press. A Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, she published the Society's official history in 1956, and served as its first woman President from 1959-64. Personal life Evans lived at Thousand Acres, Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, from 1939 until her death in 1977 at the age of 84.

Signs and symptoms Caplan syndrome presents with cough and shortness of breath in conjunction with features of rheumatoid arthritis, such as painful joints and morning stiffness. Examination should reveal tender, swollen metacarpophalangeal joints and rheumatoid nodules; auscultation of the chest may reveal diffuse crackles that do not disappear on coughing or taking a deep breath. Caplan syndrome is a nodular condition of the lung occurring in dust-exposed persons with either a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or who subsequently develop RA within the following 5‚Äì10 years. The nodules in the lung typically occur bilaterally and peripherally, on a background of simple coal workers' pneumoconiosis. There are usually multiple nodules, varying in size from 0.5 to 5.0 cm. The nodules typically appear rapidly, often in only a few weeks. Nodules may grow, remain unchanged in size, resolve, or disappear and then reappear. They can cavitate, calcify, or develop air-fluid levels. Grossly, they can resemble a giant silicotic nodule. Histologically, they usually have a necrotic center surrounded by a zone of plasma cells and lymphocytes, and often with a peripheral inflammatory zone made of macrophages and neutrophils. Causes Caplan syndrome occurs only in patients with both RA and pneumoconiosis related to mining dust (coal, asbestos, silica). The condition occurs in miners (especially those working in anthracite coal- mines), asbestosis, silicosis and other pneumoconioses. There is probably also a genetic predisposition, and smoking is thought to be an aggravating factor. Pathophysiology The presence of rheumatoid arthritis alters how a person's immune system responds to foreign materials, such as dust from a coal mine. When a person with rheumatoid arthritis is exposed to such offensive materials, they are at an increased risk of developing pneumoconiosis. Diagnosis *Chest radiology shows multiple, round, well defined nodules, usually 0.5-2.0 cm in diameter, which may cavitate and resemble tuberculosis. *Lung function tests may reveal a mixed restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect with a loss of lung volume. There may also be irreversible airflow limitation and a reduced DLCO. *Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and non-organ specific antibodies may be present in the serum. *Silicosis and asbestosis must be considered in the differential with TB. Management Once tuberculosis has been excluded, treatment is with steroids. All exposure to coal dust must be stopped, and smoking cessation should be attempted. Rheumatoid arthritis should be treated normally with early use of DMARDs. Prognosis The nodules may pre-date the appearance of rheumatoid arthritis by several years. Otherwise prognosis is as for RA; lung disease may remit spontaneously, but pulmonary fibrosis may also progress. Epidemiology Incidence is currently 1 in 100,000 people but is likely to fall as the coal mining industry declines. It has also been shown to occur in cases of complicated silicosis (marked by progressive massive pneumoconiosis). History The syndrome is named after Dr. Anthony Caplan, a physician on the Cardiff Pneumoconiosis Panel, who identified the constellation of findings as a distinct entity in a 1953 publication. He followed this with further articles exploring the disease. Caplan syndrome was originally described in coal miners with progressive massive fibrosis.

More recently it has expanded into providing onsite hotel services, and acting as a conference venue.  History  = Planning = Plans for an ambitious national sports venue, as part of wider national sports programme in Luxembourg began in the 1960s with a stated aim of the government of the time being to compete in the international arena, where it was believed it could make a name for itself. On 12 July 1969, the then Minister of Physical Education and Sports, Gaston Thorn, organised a roundtable with stakeholders, where the most preeminent view was that modern sports facilities should be available and easily accessible to athletes and civil society in Luxembourg of all levels and ages. In February 1974, French architect Roger Taillibert presented his bold plans for futuristic swimming pool and sporting arena, which captured the spirit of the Luxembourg state's desire to construct a public landmark dedicated to its national sporting ambitions and open to civil society at large. State planners decided to construct the venue on the Kirchberg plateau, which at the time was largely underdeveloped former farmland. Amongst other reasons for the decision, was the cheap and readily available land, the desire for urban development of the area, and an ambition to keep and further attract the European Communities (now European Union) institutions located there. The sporting complex was divided into an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and an indoor arena. Most strikingly, the venues, wrought of glass, pre-stressed concrete and wood, were to be encased in and connected via six giant shell or upside-down-hull copper roof structures from which the French name, d'Coque derived. Tallibert's designs were heavily informed by his then ongoing works on the Montreal Olympic Park, for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Similarities in design, materials and architectural style are particularly visible when comparing d'Coque with his work on Montreal's Olympic pool, stadium and velodrome (since refurbished as a biodome). = Construction = The project was divided into two stages, with priority given to the swimming pool, on which construction began in 1974. Initial construction work was dogged by a rumour in the national press that the olympic pool did not meet the international requirements for a length of 50 metres owing to miscalculations in the planning stage. Though this later proved to be untrue, significant delays were incurred with the swimming pool inaugurated behind schedule on 14 April 1982. However, the controversy was short-lived with residents, sports professional and amateurs alike enthralled with the quality of the facilities. Throughout the 80's, owing to the economic climate, state funds were not readily available for work on the second phase of the project. In addition, residents, politicians and planners had expressed a desire for amendments to the plans to be made to permit the indoor athletics arena to be utilised not only as a sporting arena, but a cultural venue as well. Following a turnaround in Luxembourg's finances, the Chamber of Deputies approved the allocation of some 2.5 billion francs, (62 million euros) for the second phase. Work began in earnest in 1997, with then Minister of Public Works, Robert Goebbels and Minister of Sports, Georges Wohlfart taking part in the breaking ground ceremony. In 2000, the now officially named \\"National Sports and Culture Centre d'Coque\\" was given legal personality as a public body requisite to complete its objectives. The new building, which included renovations to the swimming pool and existing structures, to allow their seamless integration, was completed in 2002. It included, aside from the additional athletics and cultural venue, spa, physiotherapy and catering facilities, as well as lodgings for competing athletes. = FondsKirchberg = Works on the second phase coincided with other developments on the Kirchberg, promoted by the FondsKirchberg (), an urban development body. This included the development of the N51 expressway, which bordered the south of the sports centre into the beautified Avenue John F. Kennedy, with two separated bus lanes (one later converted into a tram lane) and wide pedestrian sidewalks providing easy public access to the venue. The relocation of the European School of Luxembourg to a new Kirchberg site was also underway, and the decision was made to landscape the territory in between d'Coque and the new campus to provide a public park, with an artificial lake and water features, and a small open-air amphitheatre.  Venue  = Cultural events = The d'Coque indoor arena can be converted into a cultural venue, with retractable seating that can be extended over the athletics floor to permit audiences closer access to the stage. The complex has played host to a number of notable figures including the Dalai Lama's official visit to Luxembourg, and Elton John. = Sports events = In 2013 Games of the Small States of Europe (GSSE) which saw athletes from the nine member countries of the GSSE compete in eleven disciplines.

The Midwestern United States and the Canadian Prairies were hit the hardest. Only the Southwestern United States and California largely escaped its effects. February 1936 was the coldest February on record in the contiguous U.S., narrowly eclipsing February 1899. It also was the coldest month ever in Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The meteorological winter (December through February) of 1935/36 was the coldest on record for Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. This winter was much colder than the immediately preceding winters. 1930 through 1934 had very mild winters in the U.S. 1930/31 was warm in the western north central states; 1931/32 in the mid- and south-Atlantic states, the eastern north central states, and the eastern south central states; 1932/33 in New England; and, 1933/34 in the mountain and Pacific states. In the northern plains, the Februaries of 1925, 1926, 1927, 1930, 1931, and 1935 are among the 25 warmest Februaries between 1895 and 2017, although 1929 had the third- coldest February of all-time. Despite a mild March over most areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the six months from October 1935 to March 1936 were the fifth-coldest on record over the contiguous U.S. November‚ÄìDecember 1935 Winter 1935 (December 1935 ‚Äì February 1936) Precipitation, in inches. Record wettest and driest is based on a 112 yr period of records, 1895‚Äì2006. The 1935/36 cold wave began in the plains states in November, when temperatures were well below normal in many areas west of the Mississippi River. November 1935 was one of the coldest Novembers on record for Idaho (fourth coldest), Oregon (sixth coldest), Washington (seventh coldest), and North Dakota (seventh-coldest). During December, cold weather spread to the eastern half of the U.S., where most places were much below average. Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina had their second-coldest Decembers of all-time, with Florida averaging , Georgia , and South Carolina . Because of persistent chinook winds, however, Montana and British Columbia were significantly above average. January 1936 The month began with a mild spell in the eastern states, but a large storm covered the eastern half of the country by the nineteenth. The storm produced heavy snow and blocked most roads in the Appalachian Mountains. Snow was a contributing factor to several highway accidents that killed up to 100 people. The cold continued during the following weeks. The sea froze partially as far south as Chesapeake Bay. From January 25 to 28, the east had its coldest January temperatures in eighteen years, with Washington, D. C. averaging High winds in some locations caused wind chills below . In Ohio and the Centralia district of Illinois, the cold destroyed the peach crop, whilst defective heaters caused numerous dangerous fires in Minnesota. North Dakota had its fifth-coldest January of all-time with an average temperature of . February 1936 February 1936 US Temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit. Record warmest and coldest is based on a 112 yr period of records, 1895‚Äì2006. February was by far the coldest month in this severe winter. Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota had their coldest month on record. Two states recorded their coldest temperatures on record. McIntosh, South Dakota sank to , and Parshall, North Dakota hit . An unofficial reading of also was recorded in Jordan, Montana. At Devil's Lake, North Dakota, the average temperature for five weeks ending in February was . Skis had to be used in rescue operations as a succession of snowstorms hit the Pacific Northwest states and much of the nation east of the continental divide. By the middle of the month, all schools in the midwest, Great Plains, and Pacific Northwest were closed by deep snowdrifts. Health care was affected by a shortage of serum. Many remote South Dakota towns did not have outside contact for several weeks, At the peak of the cold wave, only two days of supplies were in inventory at many stores in the plains states. As far south as Richmond, Virginia, rivers were completely ice-bound. Subsequent thaws accompanied by heavy rain over the southern states led to flooding. In Canada away from the Atlantic Ocean, temperatures averaged as much as below normal. At the Saskatoon airport, the temperature did not rise above from February 2 through February 20. A temperature of was reached in Sceptre, Saskatchewan. March 1936 In the final week of February, a thaw finally came to the nation. Temperatures rose above freezing for the first time in many weeks. Fargo, North Dakota reached on March 1 for the first time since December 14, 1935. The warming led, however, to avalanches in the Pacific Northwest, where three people were killed on Snoqualmie Pass on February 24. Above average to near average temperatures were recorded throughout the U.S. in March, except for the Pacific Northwest. The melting of the heavy winter snowfalls and thawing of the ground, along with the wettest March on record in the northeastern states led to record floods in most of the region's rivers, especially on smaller tributary streams.

It carries passengers from the Edge of Africa section of the park to the Stanleyville section or vice versa. During this experience, passengers get a bird's-eye view of several attractions at the park.  History  The ride was manufactured by Von Roll of Berne, Switzerland and opened at the park in 1974. The Skyride needed to be closed beginning in 2010 to build the Cheetah Hunt roller coaster, which opened May 27, 2011. It was reopended shortly after that date. The boarding building at the former Crown Colony (now known as Cheetah Hunt Plaza, or Cheetah Plaza) section was renovated at this point, in order to aid it in fitting better with the new subsahran Africa theme (in contrast with the former colonial Africa theme). Ride experience A view from one of the dozens of gondolas running on Skyride at any given time. The following is an account of the ride from the Cheetah Hunt station to the Stanleyville station (observances while on the return trip would be in reverse order): Passengers enter a cabin at the Cheetah Hunt station. It is at this station that an enormous motor‚Äîor series of motors‚Äîpowers the movement of the continuous cable for the entire ride. The vehicle catches onto the cable and the cabin begins its first ascent. For the first half of the attraction, the cabin passes over the animal area of the park, including the \\"Edge of Africa\\" and \\"Nairobi\\" sections of the park. During this portion, passengers can see various animals to one side, and such attractions as Iron Gwazi, SheiKra, and Phoenix on the other side. The cabin then descends to a checkpoint structure where a total of three giant wheels, similar to those at each station, change the direction of the cable. It is here that two employees (one monitoring the vehicles going in each direction) ensure that the cabins have enough momentum to carry themselves across the steel tracks above while making the 90-degree turn. The cabin then returns to the cable and begins its second‚Äîand final‚Äîascent, now going perpendicular to the first half of the attraction. During the second portion, passengers can see Sand Serpent, the Timbuktu Theater and Stanley Falls Flume to one side, and Kumba to the other side. The cabin then descends to a station at the opposite end of the park, where existing passengers exit the ride and new passengers board the gondolas for the return trip to the front of the park. Characteristics The bullwheel at the Stanleyville stationThe ride consists of a single continuous cable, held up by evenly dispersed supports. From this moving cable, dozens of cabins hang, each one carrying up to four passengers (or 680 pounds). These are open cabins with four seats (two rows of two, facing each other). At each station (one at Cheetah Hunt Plaza, one at Stanleyville), a large wheel with a pulley- like groove rotates the direction in which the cable is moving. Incoming cabins are transferred from the moving cable to a stationary steel track, along which the wheels of each cabin glide. They are brought to a stop by two park employees. While one holds the vehicle in place, the other opens the cabin door as the passengers exit. The door is then closed and the vehicle is thrust around the turn. On the other side of the large wheel, another employee re-opens the door and new passengers enter the cabin. The door is re-locked and the cabin is pushed hard enough to transfer it from the steel track to the moving cable. Once on the cable, the wheels above each cabin are not used, but the cable transporting it rests within a slot between the wheels. *Gondola ‚Äì The Cabin that guests ride on the skyride. Each gondola weighs and can carry up to in passengers. According to the law, no more than 4 people may be in the gondola while riding, including infants. As well, three adults per gondola. Due to the design of the gondola, the heaviest guest must be seated on the far side of the gondola, away from the door. *Drive Station ‚Äì The station where the mechanical drive of the ride is held. This is also the main area where guests are loaded and unloaded from. The Barn is also located here. *Mid Station ‚Äì The station where the counterweight of the ride is held. At one time, passengers got off at this station for the Treetops Restaurant while it was in business. Today, passengers don‚Äôt get on or off from the Mid station. *Tension Station ‚Äì The station where guests unload at Stanleyville or Jungala. Incidents *On July 19, 2009, employee and USF player Maikon Bonani fell from the ride.

Biography Richard was the fourth of 7 sons born to Sir John Folville (died 1310) of Ashby Folville, Leicestershire. In 1321 he was created rector to the small country parish of Teigh, about 12 km east of Melton Mowbray. However, like his near- contemporaries Thomas De L'Isle or John Rippinghale, his vocation did not deter him from indulging in vigilantism and outlawry. A warrant for Richard's arrest was issued in March 1326 for his part in connection with the assassination of Sir Roger Bellere, and he was also involved in much of his siblings' later strifes. Richard seems to have masterminded the abduction and ransom of the justice Sir Richard Willoughby, later Chief Justice of the King's Bench. The chronicler Henry Knighton, our principal witness to the activities of the Folvilles, claims that the 'savage, audacious' Richard was in charge of the socialem comitivam ('allied company') which attacked Willoughby.Henry Knighton, Chronicon Henrici Knighton, vel Cnitthon, monachi Leycenstris, ed. by Joseph Rawson Lumby, 2 vols (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1889-95), I (1889), pp.460-1. The kidnap occurred in January 1332. Willoughby was seized on the road to Grantham, and escorted into nearby woodland. One indictment claims that he was carried from here to numerous dens and hideouts across the county, 'from wood to wood'.Maurice Keen, The Outlaws of Medieval Legend, rev. ed. (London: Routledge, 2000), p.199: He was at length made to pay 1300 marks for his release, and forced to swear an oath of loyalty to the Folvilles. Capture and death Richard was the only member of the Folville gang to suffer official retribution. In either 1340 or 1341, he and some of his retinue were cornered in the church of Teigh by Sir Robert Coalville, a keeper of the King's peace. After a prolonged struggle, which resulted in at least one fatality as Richard fired arrows from the church, Sir Robert succeeded in drawing Richard from the building. Once in custody Folville was summarily beheaded, in his own churchyard. After the event Pope Clement VI instructed Thomas Bek, Bishop of Lincoln, to absolve Robert and his men for killing the priest, on condition that they were whipped at each of main churches in the area, by way of penance.E.L.G. Stones, 'The Folvilles of Ashby-Folville, Leicestershire, and Their Associates in Crime, 1326-1347', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 77 (1957), pp.117-36. This is clearly reminiscent of Henry II's penance before the cathedral of Avranches, after the death of Thomas Becket.

Its name appears as \\"Witness\\" in the New King James Version, the English Standard Version and the New Living Translation. The Geneva Bible and the King James Version transliterate the original Hebrew word Ed ( ‚Äò√™·∏è), while the New International Version regards all of the following words as the name of the altar: \\"A Witness Between Us that the LORD is God\\". The New Century Version recalls the altar's name as \\"Proof That We Believe the Lord Is God\\".Joshua 22 in the New Century Version. The New American Standard Bible calls it \\"the Offensive Altar\\".New American Standard Bible, sub-heading for Joshua 22:10‚Äì34 According to Joshua 22, the eastern or Transjordanian tribes cross over the Jordan River after having assisted in the conquest of the land of Canaan. They then build a massive altar by the Jordan. This causes the \\"whole congregation of the Israelites\\" to prepare for war, but they first send to the Transjordanian tribes a delegation led by Phinehas. They accuse the eastern tribes of making God angry and suggesting that their land may be unclean. In response to this, the Transjordanian tribes say that the altar will not be used for offerings, but is only a \\"witness\\". The western tribes are satisfied, and return home. The altar's construction concerned the other tribes who felt that there should only be one altar. However the eastern tribes explained that they built it only as a testimony to their unity of religion (despite their being somewhat cut-off by the river), and not as a rival working altar (like the later calves set up by Jereboam). The eastern tribes named the altar \\"Witness\\" to fit this. Assis argues that the unusual dimensions of the altar suggest that it \\"was not meant for sacrificial use\\", but was, in fact, \\"meant to attract the attention of the other tribes\\" and provoke a reaction.Elie Assis, \\"For it shall be a witness between us: a literary reading of Josh 22,\\" Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament 18 (2004), 216‚Äì17. Davis regards the Transjordanians' action as \\"the first in a series of independent acts on the part of the various tribes which would lead to a later fragmentation of the tribes of Israel,\\" and the construction of the altar as a \\"departure of God's plan for centralized worship.\\"John J. Davis, Conquest and Crisis: Studies in Joshua, Judges and Ruth (Grand Rapids, Baker, 1977), 86‚Äì87. Location The location of the altar has also been disputed. The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary says: :The generality of our translators supposes that it was reared on the banks of the Jordan, within the limits of Canaan proper. But a little closer examination seems to make the conclusion irresistible that its position was on the eastern side of the river, for these two reasons; first, because it is said (Joshua 22:11) to have been built \\"over against,\\" or in the sight of the land of Canaan ‚Äî not within it; and secondly, because the declared motive of the trans-jordanic Israelites in erecting it was to prevent their brethren in Canaan ever saying, in time to come, \\"What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel? For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you.\\"Jamieson- Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Joshua 22, accessed 26 August 2016 Snaith asserts that it was \\"at Gilgal, on the west bank of the Jordan\\",N. H. Snaith, \\"The Altar at Gilgal: Joshua 22:23-29,\\" Vetus Testamentum 28 (1978) 335 while Assis argues that it was built east of the Jordan. The name of the altar is not clear in the Masoretic Text, and the text could be corrupted at this point. It reads \\"The Reubenites and the Gadites named the altar because it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.\\" Some textual scholars suspect that the name of the altar must have been dropped by a copyist, either deliberately or unintentionally.

It generally includes a pre-conception risk assessment for any potential complications of pregnancy as well as modifications of risk factors, such as increasing folic acid intake to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and counseling on smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and medications that may compromise fetal development. Physicians, midwives and baby experts recommend that a woman visit them as soon as the woman is contemplating having a child, and optimally around 3 to 6 months before actual attempts are made to conceive. This time frame allows a woman to better prepare her body for successful conception (fertilization) and pregnancy, and allows her to reduce any health risks which are within her control. Agencies such as the March of Dimes have developed screening tools that healthcare providers can use with their patients. In addition, obstetricians or midwives (see Obstetrics, Midwifery, General Practitioner) have developed comprehensive check-lists and assessments for the woman who is planning to become pregnant. In one sense, pre-conception counseling and assessment can be compared to a well-baby visit in which a baby is screened for normal health, normal development, with the benefit of identifying emerging problems that may have gone unnoticed in an infant. For a woman, the Pre-Conception Counseling Assessment and Screening is intended to assess normal health of a child-bearing woman, while at the same time identifying: *Existing or emerging illness or disease which may have gone undetected before, and *Existing risks for the woman who may become pregnant, and *Existing risks which may affect a fetus if the woman does become pregnant. Obstacles to pre-conception counseling A common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is that many pregnancies are still unplanned. Globally, 38% of pregnancies are unintended. For this reason, many experts recommend that all women of childbearing age be offered preconception care counseling regardless of intent to become pregnant. Another common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is of women not knowing, realizing, or understanding the benefits of visiting their physician or midwife before trying to become pregnant. Most women still take for granted the biological aspects of becoming pregnant, and do not consider the value of pre-screening before becoming pregnant. Most women who want and anticipate having a baby are naturally prone to thinking in terms of having a well baby. In the majority of cases, women do not think about having a baby who has any kind of problem. Most women do not know how their own medical history could pose risks to a developing fetus. Likewise, they may not understand that pregnancy carries a certain number of risks as well. When family history risks and pregnancy risks are considered together, it may point to potential problems for that particular woman, or to her unborn baby once she becomes pregnant. What is involved in pre-conception counseling? =Questionnaire= Pre-screening covers many body-system areas (not just the reproductive organs), as well as aspects of the woman's lifestyle, and family history information. It begins with basic information and becomes more in-depth, especially if the woman has had previous illnesses, diseases, etc. Pre-screening assessments begin with a questionnaire which the woman fills out, generally before seeing the physician or midwife. Some offices have the woman go over parts of the questionnaire with a Nurse Practitioner, if available. =Blood work= Certain blood work may be ordered. This often includes a CBC (Complete Blood Count) which can show anemia. A CBC includes WBC (White Blood Cell Count) which can show the presence of infection. Anemia and infection, indicating problems with the woman's overall health at that moment, can both affect a woman's ability to become pregnant at that time as well as affect the stability of the pregnancy and health of the fetus. In the majority of cases both infection and anemia can be treated once the cause is identified. Anemia may require ongoing evaluation and iron supplement. =Urinalysis= Urine sample or urinalysis can reveal the presence of proteinuria (protein in the urine), a possible indicator of infection or kidney disease, or the presence of blood which can indicate a urinary tract infection. Urinalysis might also show the presence of glucose (glycosuria), but women of child-bearing age are unlikely to have undiagnosed diabetes (this is separate from gestational diabetes that may occasionally develop during the course of a subsequent pregnancy). Using the assessment =Physicians= When women have pre-existing illnesses / conditions / diseases, these may add to pre-natal risks and will need ongoing evaluation. Also any medications which are used to treat these conditions will need monitored and possibly reduced or increased. The presence of Diabetes remains a huge risk for the unborn child, and a woman will be screened specifically for this condition. Known diabetics will need monitored closely. For more information, see this online article Diabetes and Diabetic risks. =The woman's role= A woman may need to adjust certain aspects of her health and well-being which are in her control. These usually include aspects of lifestyle, drug and alcohol use, exercise, rest and stress reduction. In addition, she may need to discontinue certain herbs or over-the-counter medications as recommended by her healthcare provider. Many physicians will also recommend pre-natal vitamins before a woman actually conceives in order to boost her overall health.

These funerary steles present a disc-shaped head facing the rising sun on a trapezoidal stand. They belong to an old tradition throughout all of the Western Mediterranean, which includes parts of Europe and North Africa, but today they are mainly found in the Basque Country.  Examples  Image:Hilarri-4symb.jpgA cross and a rosette by sector. Image:Hilarri_PawCross.jpgA cross patt√©e and text 'our grave'. Image:Orhoitzapena.jpgA lauburu and text 'Memory'. Image:Hilarri_Stars.jpgA cross and many kinds of stars.  Ornamentation  = Typology = The disc may be decorated by: # geometric symbols, generally organizing the disc into four or eight circle sectors (marked or implicit), a structuring of space that recalls the coat of arms of Navarre; # a single rosette; # a lauburu or other figures that indicate a rotation; # more specific figures. A smaller rosette, a Christian cross or a text may be added on the stand.  Geometric symbols  Geometric symbols are regularly distributed on the disc within 4 or 8 circle sectors. The quarters are often delimited by a cross as: * a flowered cross (flory), often reinforced by tangent arcs linking arms to each other; * a kind of cross patt√©e with concave ends evoking the Maltese cross; * an Occitan cross, similar to the former but with, for each arm, 2 concavities delimited by 3 tips. They may be very simple or well worked. Sometimes, a diagonal secondary cross completes the figure. Each sector is decorated with various small decorative symbols such as stars, moons, potent crosses or rosettes. They may be different in each sector. Sometimes, depictions of tools point out the trade of the deceased, whose name is seldom mentioned. Stylized hands open upwards may also be found.  Rosettes  A figure with 6 loops. Many steles are decorated by single rosettes. In this case the order of symmetry is often 6. The most frequent figures are: *rosettes made up of 6 laurel leaves (with 2 in a horizontal plane); *rosettes with 8 to 36 petals radiating from a central spot; *stars as pentagram, hexagram or octogram (with 5, 6 or 8 points) ; sometimes an armed-cross is superimposed, arms being inserted between points; *a square made up of 4 smaller squares; *one circular string making up 4 or 6 loops around a central spot or circle, or 2 of them doing 8 loops; these rosettes seem static but in fact, loops have a sense of rotation that can be figured (the cord toward the right upside) or not.  Figures indicating a rotation  Some figures are designed to give an idea of rotation, generally clockwise, a sense which is often analyzed as positive. The most popular figures are : *the lauburu; *solar rosettes (of approximately 16 to 36 wings evoking a camera shutter). One Navarrese hilarri presents a kind of lauburu made of four walking legs. This motive cannot be considered as usual in the Basque Country.  Other symbols  Some more specific figures can be encountered as: *a figure that looks like a $ symbol, made up of 3 vertical lines, crossing 3 horizontal segments, linked to each other as a wide S; it could be a symbolic representation of weaving; *Christograms (IHS + cross); *some rare human representations can also be noticed; pentagrams could have been a stylization of human body. They are all identified with Christ as the sun rising after Resurrection, evident also in Basque church symbols and the imagery of Loyola's Jesuit Order. = Surrounding = The surrounding of the disc is often decorated, giving an impression of a shining sun. = Modern hilarris = Many innovative ornamentations can be observed in modern hilarris. As an example, in Zuberoa, the traditional song \\"Orhiko txoria\\" (the bird of Orhy) has led to many representations of a bird flying towards this emblematic mountain. Others have seen connections to a prehistoric solar cult arriving with the Mauri or Jentillak and related to the Egyptian Horus, consort or manifestation of the Ishtar (the star) of Fertility among the desert and Sea People.

The Isaacs syndrome is a result of an autoimmune reaction against the Kv1.1 ion channel.  Genomics  The gene is located on the Watson (plus) strand of the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p13.32). The gene itself is 8,348 bases in length and encodes a protein of 495 amino acids (predicted molecular weight 56.466 kiloDaltons).  Alternative names  The recommended name for this protein is potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1 but a number of alternatives have been used in the literature including HuK1 (human K+ channel I), RBK1 (rubidium potassium channel 1), MBK (mouse brain K+ channel), voltage gated potassium channel HBK1, voltage gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.1, voltage-gated K+ channel HuKI and AEMK (associated with myokymia with periodic ataxia).  Structure  The protein is believed to have six domains (S1-S6) with the loop between S5 and S6 forming the channel pore. This region also has a conserved selectivity filter motif. The functional channel is a homotetramer. The N-terminus of the protein associates with Œ≤ subunits. These subunits regulate channel inactivation as well as its expression. The C-terminus is associated with a PDZ domain protein involved in channel targeting.  Function  The protein functions as a potassium selective channel through which the potassium ion may pass in consensus with the electrochemical gradient. They play a role in repolarisation of membranes.  RNA editing  The pre-mRNA of this protein is subject to RNA editing. = Type = A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) that specifically recognize adenosines within double-stranded regions of pre-mRNAs (e.g. Potassium channel RNA editing signal) and deaminate them to inosine. Inosines are recognised as guanosine by the cells translational machinery. There are three members of the ADAR family ADARs 1-3 with ADAR1 and ADAR2 being the only enzymatically active members. ADAR3 is thought to have a regulatory role in the brain. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are widely expressed in tissues while ADAR3 is restricted to the brain. The double stranded regions of RNA are formed by base-pairing between residues in the region close to the editing site with residues usually in a neighboring intron but can sometimes be an exonic sequence too. The region that base pairs with the editing region is known as an Editing Complementary Sequence (ECS). = Location = The modified residue is found at amino acid 400 of the final protein. This is located in the sixth transmembrane region found, which corresponds to the inner vestibule of the pore. A stem loop hairpin structure mediates the RNA editing. ADAR2 is likely to be the preferred editing enzyme at the I/V site. Editing results in a codon alteration from ATT to GTT, resulting in an amino acid change from isoleucine to valine. ADAR2 enzyme is the major editing enzyme. The MFOLD programme predicted that the minimum region required for editing would form an imperfect inverted repeat hairpin. This region is composed of a 114 base pairs. Similar regions have been identified in mouse and rat. The edited adenosine is found in a 6-base pair duplex region. Mutation experiment in the region near the 6-base pair duplex have shown that the specific bases in this region were also essential for editing to occur. The region required for editing is unusual in that the hairpin structure is formed by exonic sequences only. In the majority of A to I editing the ECS is found within an intronic sequence. = Conservation = The editing is highly conserved having been observed in squid, fruit fly, mouse, and rat. = Regulation = Editing levels vary in different tissues: 17% in the caudate nucleus, 68% in the spinal cord, and 77% in the medulla. = Consequences =  Structure  Editing results in a codon (I/V) change from (ATT) to (GTT) resulting in translation of a valine instead of an isoleucine at the position of the editing site. Valine has a larger side-chain. RNA editing at this position occurs at a highly conserved ion conducting pore of the channel. This may affect the channels role in the process of fast inactivation.  Function  Voltage-dependent potassium channels modulate excitability by opening and closing a potassium selective pore in response to voltage. The flow of potassium ions is interrupted by interaction of an inactivating particle, an auxiliary protein in humans but an intrinsic part of the channel in other species. The I to V amino acid change is thought to disrupt the hydrophobic interaction between the inactivating particle and the pore lining. This interrupts the process of fast inactivation. Activation kinetics are unaffected by RNA editing. Changes in inactivation kinetics affect the duration and frequency of the action potential. An edited channel passes more current and has a shorter action potential than the non-edited type due to the inability of the inactivating particle to interact with the residue in the ion-conducting pore of the channel. This was determined by electrophysiology analysis. The length of time the membrane is depolarised is decreased, which also reduces the efficiency of transmitter release. Since editing can cause amino acid changes in 1- 4 in potassium channel tetramers, it can have a wide variety of effects on channel inactivation. = Dysregulation = Changes in the process of fast inactivation are known to have behavioral and neurological consequences in vivo.  Clinical  Mutations in this gene cause episodic ataxia type 1.

The main (but not the only) purpose of Irish competition law is to enhance consumer welfare. The key provisions of Irish competition law: (a) usually outlaw anti-competitive arrangements between businesses and economic operators (known as \\"undertakings\\"); (b) always outlaw the abuse of dominance by undertakings; (c) control certain mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures; and (d) control certain activities in the grocery sector. Irish competition law is primarily statute-based with some judge-made rules (the so-called \\"common law\\"). The statute rules are embodied primarily in the Competition Act 2002 (which replaced the Competition Acts 1991-1996), the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006; the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012; and the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. Irish competition law is comparable to, but quite different in certain key respects, from European Union competition law. There are some similarities to the antitrust law of the United States of America but the differences (particularly in relation to merger control, abuse of dominance and the way in which breaches are punished) are substantial. So it is best to see Irish competition law as sui generis. For example, the Irish competition agency (the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (the \\"CCPC\\")) may not impose fines while many competition agencies worldwide may do so. Irish competition law is enforced by the courts (which have the power to find breaches, permit unannounced visits by the CCPC) and impose penalties), the CCPC (which has the power to institute investigations and take court actions) and private action by \\"aggrieved persons\\" (the latter do not have to be undertakings). Unlike many other competition agencies (such as the [European Commission]), the CCPC does not, and may not, have the power to impose fines; this is due to the Irish Constitution which limits the power to impose penalties and sanctions to the judicial system (i.e., the courts); some would argue that Irish competition law is a better system for having the filter of the CCPC having to make its case to the police (the Garda Siochana) and the Director of Public Prosecutions before cases are instituted with the extra protection of the judges and, in criminal cases, juries acting as a filter to ensure robust cases are taken. Relationship with EU Competition Law Irish competition law, Irish law must not contradict or inhibit the operation of EC law, but it may outlaw things which are legal under EU law, or punish breaches more severely. It also exercises a persuasive force over the jurisprudence of Irish competition law. Due to the requirement of compliance with EU law and the similar understanding and goals, Irish Courts will examine cases and precedents in the European Courts to see how it has been interpreted or to ensure that they are consistent. EU competition law has jurisdiction over cases which affect inter-state trade in the Union. Regulation 1/2003 of the European Commission \\"decentralised\\" the enforcement of competition law with a number of reforms designed to increase the enforcement of EC rules in national courts.SCADPlus: Application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty Enforcement The law is primarily enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (which replaced the Irish Competition Authority on 31 October 2014), who review mergers, and investigate cartels and abuse of dominance by undertakings. They can fine offenders, when can be appealed to the High Court. Private enforcement is also possible. An aggrieved party may sue the offender for damages under the Competition Act. However this facility has not been exercised much, possibly due to the difficulty of gathering evidence to prove such a breach. Regulation 1/2003 of the European Commission sought to increase private and public enforcement of EC rules in national courts to allow the commission to concentrate on bigger cases. The CCPC operates a Cartel Immunity Programme which allows for immunity or leniency in sentencing for offenders which supply information to them that allows the prosecution of other breaches of the law.The Competition Authority - Enforcing Competition Law - Cartel Immunity Programme The rule mirrors the European Commission's Leniency policy. Irish competition law also regulates certain mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures. Part III of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority must approve transactions which fall within the scope of Part III before they may be lawfully implemented.

During much of this time, his sermons were recorded for broadcast on WLAC radio on Sunday nights. He was considered by many to be \\"the best preacher of the Churches of Christ during his lifetime.\\" He advocated a method of preaching that focused on meeting the particular needs of his listeners and tailored the content and techniques used to the \\"life-situation\\" of the particular audience. Baxter's style was very different from the harder style that originated in the debating tradition of the Churches of Christ, emphasizing a \\"softer\\" gospel of love. He trained hundreds of younger preachers and his influence was such \\"that at one time many could readily tell if a preacher had trained at Lipscomb college.\\" Baxter was also a writer for the Gospel Advocate and 20th Century Christian. He wrote eleven books including Speaking for the Master, I Believe Because, and When Life Tumbles In. He coauthored two books, and coedited seven more. He became the regular speaker for the Herald of Truth television program in August 1959. When the program went to a radio series, he was featured periodically. In his youth, Baxter was an avid tennis player, winning the city championship in the boys' (14 and under) classification in Nashville, Tennessee.

For instance, the cubical graph is the graph formed by the 8 vertices and 12 edges of a three-dimensional cube. has vertices, edges, and is a regular graph with edges touching each vertex. The hypercube graph may also be constructed by creating a vertex for each subset of an -element set, with two vertices adjacent when their subsets differ in a single element, or by creating a vertex for each -digit binary number, with two vertices adjacent when their binary representations differ in a single digit. It is the -fold Cartesian product of the two-vertex complete graph, and may be decomposed into two copies of connected to each other by a perfect matching. Hypercube graphs should not be confused with cubic graphs, which are graphs that have exactly three edges touching each vertex. The only hypercube graph that is a cubic graph is the cubical graph .  Construction  Construction of by connecting pairs of corresponding vertices in two copies of The hypercube graph may be constructed from the family of subsets of a set with elements, by making a vertex for each possible subset and joining two vertices by an edge whenever the corresponding subsets differ in a single element. Equivalently, it may be constructed using vertices labeled with -bit binary numbers and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever the Hamming distance of their labels is one. These two constructions are closely related: a binary number may be interpreted as a set (the set of positions where it has a digit), and two such sets differ in a single element whenever the corresponding two binary numbers have Hamming distance one. Alternatively, may be constructed from the disjoint union of two hypercubes , by adding an edge from each vertex in one copy of to the corresponding vertex in the other copy, as shown in the figure. The joining edges form a perfect matching. Another construction of is the Cartesian product of two-vertex complete graphs . More generally the Cartesian product of copies of a complete graph is called a Hamming graph; the hypercube graphs are examples of Hamming graphs.  Examples  The graph consists of a single vertex, while is the complete graph on two vertices and is a cycle of length . The graph is the 1-skeleton of a cube, a cubical graph, a planar graph with eight vertices and twelve edges. The graph is the Levi graph of the M√∂bius configuration. It is also the knight's graph for a toroidal 4\\\\times 4 chessboard..  Properties  =Bipartiteness= Every hypercube graph is bipartite: it can be colored with only two colors. The two colors of this coloring may be found from the subset construction of hypercube graphs, by giving one color to the subsets that have an even number of elements and the other color to the subsets with an odd number of elements. = Hamiltonicity = Every hypercube with has a Hamiltonian cycle, a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. Additionally, a Hamiltonian path exists between two vertices and if and only if they have different colors in a -coloring of the graph. Both facts are easy to prove using the principle of induction on the dimension of the hypercube, and the construction of the hypercube graph by joining two smaller hypercubes with a matching. Hamiltonicity of the hypercube is tightly related to the theory of Gray codes. More precisely there is a bijective correspondence between the set of -bit cyclic Gray codes and the set of Hamiltonian cycles in the hypercube .. An analogous property holds for acyclic n-bit Gray codes and Hamiltonian paths. A lesser known fact is that every perfect matching in the hypercube extends to a Hamiltonian cycle.. The question whether every matching extends to a Hamiltonian cycle remains an open problem.Ruskey, F. and Savage, C. Matchings extend to Hamiltonian cycles in hypercubes on Open Problem Garden. 2007. = Other properties = The hypercube graph (for ) : * is the Hasse diagram of a finite Boolean algebra. * is a median graph. Every median graph is an isometric subgraph of a hypercube, and can be formed as a retraction of a hypercube. * has more than perfect matchings.

Szymanski's conjecture concerns the suitability of a hypercube as a network topology for communications. It states that, no matter how one chooses a permutation connecting each hypercube vertex to another vertex with which it should be connected, there is always a way to connect these pairs of vertices by paths that do not share any directed edge..

Notable users of models in the EX Series include Patrik Jensen and Anders Bj√∂rler of The Haunted, Peter Tagtgren of Hypocrisy, Seth of Behemoth, Devin Townsend and Jed Simon of Strapping Young Lad, Chris McCarthy of Internal Bleeding, Wayne Static of Static-X, Dan Jacobs of Atreyu, Silenoz of Dimmu Borgir, and Jesper Str√∂mblad of In Flames. ESP began the EX Series with models such as the EX-100 and the EX-102 among others. In 2000 there was an EX-350 that was a set neck with a Floyd Rose and 2 humbuckers, it was only available in oxblood red. In 2003, those models were discontinued and the EX-351 and EX-50 were introduced. The EX-351 was discontinued in 2004 when the EX-400, EX-400BD, and the EX-260 were introduced. The EX-400BD was discontinued in 2007, therefore the EX-400, EX-260, and EX-50 are the only EX models currently produced by ESP in the LTD production line. The discontinued models are still sold online or in some guitar shops that still have them in stock.  History  James Hetfield of Metallica playing an ESP EXP guitar, with a design similar to that of Gibson Explorer Dan Jacobs of Atreyu playing an ESP EX guitar, with sharp edges The EX series began as the MX Series in the mid to late 1980s, firstly producing a MX 220 based on a 1970s Gibson Explorer Body with the ‚Äòfamed‚Äô banana headstock, then later with the MX 250 model (as shown in the pic above) with a smaller headstock and a 1980s Gibson body shape. Towards the late 1990s the range was renamed as EXP series (often simply called the ESP Explorer), which featured a design exactly like the Gibson Explorer, down to the same rounded body edges and headstock shape; the only differences being EMG pickups, two control knobs (versus the three on Gibson Explorers) and the ESP logo on the headstock. Soon after Gibson's decision to sue ESP, ESP discontinued the EXP series for international markets and began production of the current EX series, featuring a different design with more pointed edges and the usual ESP headstock shape, to avoid any lawsuit. Metallica's James Hetfield is probably the most renowned user of the MX series, which he has been using since the late 1980s. He further popularized the series with his legendary \\"EET FUK\\" MX 220.and his custom ESP JH-2, a black MX 250 with diamond plating. Hetfield's equipment includes many custom made guitars that closely resemble the original EXP guitars in looks as well as specifications. The most recent example (though with a few alterations to body and headstock design) is the ESP JH Snakebyte, which has been available to the public ‚Äì along with a lower-priced LTD model ‚Äì since the summer of 2011.  ESP EX  This is ESPs standard EX series guitar.

The revue sets songs cut from Sondheim's better-known musicals, as well as songs from his then-unproduced musical Saturday Night to a dialogue-free plot about the relationship between two lonely New York single people, who are in emotional conflict during an evening in their separate one-room apartments. Despite knowing of the other's existence, they never get up the courage to talk to each other, though they imagine what such an encounter might be like.Sommer, Elyse.Marry Me a Little review curtainup.com, October 19, 1997 History The musical originally was staged by the off-off-Broadway Production Company. It opened on October 29, 1980 and closed December 28, 1980. It re-opened March 12, 1981 at the off- Broadway Actor's Playhouse, where it ran for 96 performances. Directed by Rene and choreographed by Don Johanson, it starred Craig Lucas and Suzanne Henry. On June 7, 1982 the musical opened at the King's Head Theatre, London, directed by Robert Cushman and choreographed by Dennis Grimaldi. The revue has been performed in US regional theaters such as GroundWorks Theatre, Nashville, Tennessee in March 2009 Listing for Marry Me a Little groundworkstheatre.blogspot.com, retrieved December 10, 2009 and the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, in May 2009.Hetrick, Adam. \\"Marry Me a Little Opens at Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park May 14\\" playbill.com, May 14, 2009. In late 1998 actor Steve Gideon proposed a revival of the work with the casting of a male same-sex couple to play the leads. He approached Stephen Sondheim with the idea and was given permission. The new version of the work debuted at the Celebration Theatre in Hollywood, CA in 1999. A version of the main title with Harry Nilsson singing can be found on bootlegs. In 2008, Marry Me a Little was performed in South Africa in a production starring David Fick opposite Talia Egelhof and then Nathan Fredericks in two successive runs of the show at the Intimate Theatre in Cape Town from 28 June - 5 July. The production was directed by Jacqui Kowen, with musical direction by Victor Tichart. In 2012, the Off-Broadway Keen Company presented a new version of Marry Me a Little starring Jason Tam and Lauren Molina. This production included several new songs and a new concept. The production was directed by Jonathan Silverstein and started previews September 11, 2012, opening October 2, 2012 at the Clurman Theatre at Theatre Row. Both Stephen Sondheim and Craig Lucas were involved in the project. In January, 2013, The New Repertory Theatre in Watertown, Massachusetts, under the direction of Ilyse Robbins, received permission to do a gender-neutral staging of Marry Me a Little, using four actors‚Äîtwo women and two men‚Äîand two pianists. The action here takes place in four apartments in Manhattan, with varying pairing up on songs as man and woman, woman and woman, and man and man (this latter pairing effectively used especially in the lyrics of \\"So Many People\\" from Saturday Night). At the end of the performance the four actors do meet for a closing finale. In March, 2014, a Canadian production of Marry Me a Little opened at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto, directed by Adam Brazier and starring Elodie Gillett and Adrian Marchuk. The production showed the two characters living together in a relationship that eventually comes to an end. From June 29 to August 10, 2014, a British production opened at the St James Theatre in London, directed by Hannah Chissick, under the musical direction of David Randall, and starring Simon Bailey and Laura Pitt-Pulford. The critically acclaimed, sell-out production went on to get another week at the St James Theatre's Studio from October 6 to October 11, 2014. From January 28 to February 13, 2017, the show will be presented at The Gallery Players directed by Barrie Gelles and starring Jesse Manocherian, Alyson Leigh Rosenfeld, Adrian Rifat, Paul Williams, Cassandra Dupler and Laura Cetti. A first for this show, there will be three rotating casts performing each weekend: one duo is male and female, one is an all-male duo, and one is an all-female duo. In Autumn 2020, the production will have a socially distanced run at the Barn Theatre in Cirencester, starring Rob Houchen, Celinde Schoenmaker and Waylon Jacobs.

Casorate Primo borders the following municipalities: Besate, Bubbiano, Calvignasco, Morimondo, Motta Visconti, Trovo, Vernate. It also borders the Province of Milan.  Etymology  The origin of the word \\"Casorate\\" is debated. A Latin etymology for the word has been considered, especially from the word casula (little house), or the medieval Latin term casuri (also little house). On the other hand, a Celtic origin of the name has been suggested to, from the word casurus, which would date back to the Gaulish domination, which might suggest that the town's origins are even older than the generally accepted theory of a Roman origin. In 865 AD, a document makes reference to Catoriacum or Catoriaco, which is believed to be a reference to Casorate. In 1193, it seemed to be called Caxeradho. The addition of \\"Primo\\" (Italian for \\"first\\") to Casorate came about on March 15, 1863, due to it belonging to what was at the time the First District of Milan, and it has since then been named thus.  History  The origins of Casorate Primo are not clearly known. The first evidence of settlement in the current location of the town date back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, during the ancient Roman dominion of the area (at which time the land was part of Cisalpine Gaul, due to being inhabited by Celtic peoples, such as the Insubres). Nonetheless, due to a lack of archaeological and historical evidence, it is possible that there were settlements on the territory from before this period. By the 5th-6th century, the village was fully Christianized. The first document which mentions the town dates from 865 AD, as \\"Catoracium\\". Another appears in 977 AD, in which Holy Roman Emperor Otto II gave the Bishop of Pavia feudal sovereignty over a territory which included Casorate. Due to being under such a rule, the town was shielded from a lot of political affairs, even though its territory saw the 1239 battle between the Lombard League and Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, which saw the latter's defeat. Casorate Primo was referred to as an oppidum in the 15th century, which would suggest that it had city walls, similar to some nearby communes such as Binasco and Rosate. Historians seem to suggest that such walls were flattened in 1783.  Relationship with Milan and Pavia  Casorate Primo has had an interesting relationship with both cities, being more or less geographically equidistant between the two. Historically, Milan and Pavia have fought over control of the village, due to its fertile terrain, bigger population compared to neighbouring villages, and its elegant manor houses. From a religious point of view, Casorate has almost always been under Milan. Today, Casorate Primo is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan, and as such practices the Ambrosian rite. However, from an administrative perspective, Milan has historically been under Pavia's authority, such as under the Duchy of Milan's Province of Pavia, and was part of the Campagna Soprana. Despite being part of the Province of Pavia, the people of Casorate Primo speak casoratese, which is a variant of the Milanese dialect of Insubric, as opposed to the Pavese dialect.

Never to recover its former splendour, it was annexed to the colonia of Piacenza, and remained under that city‚Äôs control after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages Casteggio came under the influence of Pavia, to which it was assigned by Frederick Barbarossa in 1164. In 1441 it was acquired by Cesare Martinengo, and was later ruled by the Simonetta, Sforza, Bentivoglio and Del Carretto dynasties. It was heavily damaged during the Italian Wars of late 15th and early 16th centuries. Notable people * Birthplace of the explorer Giuseppe Maria Giulietti.

Hallux flexus was initially described by Davies-Colley in 1887 as a plantar flexed posture of phalanx relative to the metatarsal head. About the same time, Cotterill first used the term hallux rigidus.  Signs and symptoms  * Pain and stiffness in the joint at the base of the big toe during use (walking, standing, bending, etc.) * Difficulty with certain activities (running, squatting) * Swelling and inflammation around the joint Although the condition is degenerative, it can occur in patients who are relatively young, particularly active sports people who have at some time suffered trauma to the joint (turf toe). A notable example is NBA star Shaquille O'Neal who returned to basketball after surgery.  Causes  This condition, which occurs in adolescents and adults, can be associated with previous trauma. The true cause is not known. Most commonly, hallux rigidus is thought to be caused by wear and tear of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Classification  In 1988, Hattrup and Johnson described the following radiographic classification system: * Grade I ‚Äì mild changes with maintained joint space and minimal spurring. * Grade II ‚Äì moderate changes with narrowing of joint space, bony proliferation on the metatarsophalangeal head and phalanx and subchondral sclerosis or cyst. * Grade III ‚Äì severe changes with significant joint space narrowing, extensive bony proliferation and loose bodies or a dorsal ossicle.  Treatment  =Non-surgical= Early treatment for mild cases of hallux rigidus may include prescription foot orthotics, shoe modifications (such as a pad under the joint, and/or a deeper toeboxto take the pressure off the toe and/or facilitate walking), specialized footwear ('rocker-sole' shoes), medications (anti-inflammatory drugs) or injection therapy (corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and pain). Physical therapy programs may be recommended, although there is very limited evidence that they provide benefit for reducing pain and improving function of the joint. =Surgical= In some cases, surgery is the only way to eliminate or reduce pain. There are several types of surgery for treatment of hallux rigidus. The type of surgery is based on the stage of hallux rigidus. According to the Coughlin and Shurnas Clinical Radiographic Scale: Stage 1 hallux rigidus involves some loss of range of motion of the big toe joint or first MTP joint and is often treated conservatively with prescription foot orthotics. Stage 2 hallux rigidus involves greater loss of range of motion and cartilage and may be treated via cheilectomy in which the metatarsal head is reshaped and bone spurs reduced. Stage 3 hallux rigidus often involves significant cartilage loss and may be treated by an osteotomy in which cartilage on the first metatarsal head is repositioned, possibly coupled with a hemi-implant in which the base of the proximal phalanx (base of the big toe) is resurfaced. Stage 4 hallux rigidus, also known as end stage hallux rigidus, involves severe loss of range of motion of the big toe joint and cartilage loss. Stage 4 hallux rigidus may be treated via fusion of the joint (arthrodesis) or implant arthroplasty in which both sides of the joint are resurfaced or a hinged implant is used. Fusion of the joint is often viewed as more definitive but may lead to significant alteration of gait causing postural symptomatology. The implants termed \\"two part unconstrained\\" implants in which a \\"ball\\" type device is placed on the first metatarsal head and \\"socket\\" portion on the base of the big toe do not have a good long term track record. The hinged implants have been in existence since the 1970s, have been continually improved and have the best record of improving long term function.

In the early days, there were three main types of guitar-synthesizers: :* Multi-effects type :* Frequency-to-Voltage converter type (using guitar with pickups) :* Guitorgan type (using guitar with fretboard switches) Later, the multi-effects type evolved into modeling guitar, and the other two types evolved into current devices. Presently, there are two main groups: :* Guitar-synth using guitars: regular guitars equipped with special electronic sensors that actuate a synthesizer :* Guitar-synth using non-guitar controllers: guitar-like MIDI controllers. Both types have advantages and disadvantages. = Software solutions = Though the term \\"MIDI guitar\\" is sometimes used as a synonym, MIDI is not the indispensable feature of guitar synthesizers, especially after advances in DSP technology. Software- based guitar synthesizers without any special pickups have appeared, featuring polyphonic audio recognition (recognizing polyphonic pitches of each string, and possibly distinguish combination of fret positions and strings). Guitar- based models Fuji-Roland G303 (1979) played by Pat Metheny. Typical instruments in this category consist of: * an electric or acoustic or bass guitar; * a hexaphonic pickup (also called a \\"divided pickup\\") that provides a separate analog output for each vibrating string; * a converter that translates each of these analog signals to corresponding digital representations, extracting the fundamental frequency or pitch of each, and passing this data along (CV/Gate in early days, and later MIDI-formatted). This digital output can be stored or input directly to a synthesizer that generates corresponding notes made audible through an amplifier and speaker. These components may be integrated into the instrument body or modularized in different ways. The hexaphonic pickup may be a separate component added to the guitar, or it may be built-in. Earlier guitar-synths required the musician to use a proprietary guitar with an integrated hexaphonic pickup. = Roland GK interface = Roland GK-3 divided pickup mounted on normal electric guitar Roland developed its GK series of hexaphonic drivers, consisting of a divided pickup and associated electronics (essentially a buffer preamp for each string signal). These were used in two ways, either with pickup and buffer module mountable to the guitar, or as a \\"GK-KIT\\" intended to be fitted into a guitar body by a luthier or manufacturer. The initial GK-1 had 24 output pins, with a resultantly bulky interface cable. The design evolved into a smaller 13-pin format, used in the GK-2, GK-2A, and GK-3 pickups, as well as the GK-3B bass pickup. Guitar manufacturers that offered models with the installed \\"Roland- ready\\" pickup kit include Switch Music, Washburn, Fender, Squier, and Ibanez (RG420GK). Fender released their Fender VG Stratocaster, a Standard Series instrument with inbuilt GK-2A hexaphonic pickup kit. Fender had previously offered a short-lived American Series version in the mid-1990s. Godin and a few other guitar manufacturers have offered guitar models with an integrated \\"RMC hexaphonic pickup and preamp system\\" that is compatible with Roland devices. The RMC system uses piezo-crystal pickups built into the saddles of the guitar bridge, which conduct the vibrations of the strings as a signal that can be converted into a (13-pin) hexaphonic synth signal. This setup can be found in the xtSA and the LGX models. The GK drivers or compatible controllers are connected to a dedicated synthesizer module like Roland GR-1 or Roland GR-55 via a cable with 13-pin connectors. The module sits on the floor and has the appearance of a large effects unit, with footswitches for the selection of sounds and memory banks. = MIDI guitars = Casio PG-380 MIDI Guitar (1988) Usually, a cable connects the hexaphonic pickup to the converter. This allows the guitarist to be unencumbered by an on-board converter. However, several Casio models in the PG and MG product lines integrated the guitar, the hex pickup, and the converter as a single unit. Casio remains the only manufacturer to try this approach. The advantage of this arrangement is that a MIDI cable can be plugged directly into the guitar. Disadvantages include weight and the need for an external power supply. In addition to these configurations, the converter may also be combined with a synthesizer. The earliest models were combination converter/synthesizers, and this type is still produced. As the early integrated models predated the MIDI standard, their components were not interchangeable; the guitarist's only option was to use whatever synthesizer came with the converter, and vice versa. By the 2000s (decade), however, all converter/synthesizers were MIDI- compatible, so any synthesizer with MIDI-input capability (the vast majority since the 1990s) can be used. Stand-alone converter units also drive synthesizers via MIDI. = Pros and cons = Among the advantages of synth guitars are that the musician can play either the guitar or the synthesizer alone, or blend the timbres of the both together in any ratio. Many models can be used with almost any guitar, with the addition of a hexaphonic pickup. In the early systems, there was a detectable latency, especially at lower pitches, between playing a note on the guitar and the note's sounding on the synthesizer, but this was remedied in 2000s-era instruments. While this type is also somewhat prone to note-tracking glitches, the problem can be overcome by adjusting the sensitivity controls of the pickup or converter -- and by playing more precisely. Another possible disadvantage is that not all of the variable performance parameters available on a synthesizer can be actuated from a guitar; a synth guitar lacks assignable controls to open a filter in real-time, for example. Nevertheless, contemporary synth-guitar designs often include an expression pedal for such purposes.  Translation of guitar techniques  Some systems consist of two separated parts, the guitar controller and the interface and sound module, where the former control the latter (as in Roland instruments). One of the challenges of guitar synths is that not all performance techniques can be smoothly translated into MIDI and resulting sound. Harmonics, palm mutes, hammer-ons and pull-offs, and pick slides are not easily picked up by guitar synths, largely due to imperfect fretting technique; with the exception of harmonics and palm mutes, these techniques can be achieved with a concentrated effort to maintain good fretting. Similarly, the synthesizer portion of a system often lack the variety of controls (sliders, faders, knobs) for synthesis parameters that are normally available on a standard keyboard synthesizer. Nevertheless, controlling a synthesizer with a guitar has some advantages over a keyboard. More expansive chords are possible, and some intervals are easier to reach. As well, guitar synths provide access to sounds normally available only to keyboard players and percussionists. A guitar player could play a flute part using a sampled flute patch, or play percussion by triggering synth drum voices. By blending the regular electric guitar tone with synthesized sounds, a guitarist can create a hybrid timbre. The guitar synth also enables a guitarist with limited or no keyboard-playing skills to provide MIDI input into digital notation programs such as Sibelius, Finale or MuseScore.  Guitar-like MIDI controllers  Some manufacturers of guitar-synthesizers wanted to eliminate the tracking and latency problems associated with guitar- based systems, while retaining the expressiveness of the guitar. They achieved this, to some degree, by redesigning the instrument part of the human-machine interface so that it was better suited to driving a synthesizer. = Earlier models = The 1980s-era SynthAxe was a futuristic controller consisting of a fretboard attached to the body at an obtuse angle. The fretboard strings were used to indicate pitch and sensed string bends. A separate, shorter set of strings were used for picking and strumming. These triggered the notes fretted on the fretboard's strings. It also featured trigger keys that could be used instead of the trigger strings. A whammy bar was assignable to any MIDI parameter. The SynthAxe was prohibitively expensive and therefore not widely used. Two of the most famous SynthAxe users are guitarist Allan Holdsworth and percussionist Roy \\"Futureman\\" Wooten of the jazz quartet B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones. Wooten programmed his modified SynthAxe controller with a variety of Drum Kit and Percussion sounds. The instrument was previously owned by jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour. Yamaha originally entered the market with a guitar- like MIDI controller called the \\"G-10,\\" considerably less expensive than the SynthAxe. The G-10 had two assignable knobs and an assignable whammy bar and it used six strings, all the same gauge [thickness], which sensed both right- and left-hand input. The fact that the strings were all of the same thickness made the instrument feel substantially different for a player, in contrast to the typical guitar, and may have hindered the instrument's acceptance. Both the SynthAxe and Yamaha G-10 have been discontinued. = Recent models = Beginning in the early 2000s, Yamaha have re-entered the market with simple midi guitars (EZ-AG and EZ-EG) these have illuminated frets to teach finger technique and 20 voices. Starr Labs' Ztar is one of the few remaining guitar- like controller product lines still in production. A Ztar differs significantly from the SynthAxe and Yamaha G-10 in that the \\"fretboard\\" is covered with keys, not strings. Keys in the same row can trigger notes at the same time. This has no analog on a real guitar. It would be as if a single string were polyphonic. A number of variations are available, including an instrument that uses strings for strumming or picking, to trigger notes, whereas the pitch of the notes is determined by the keys that cover what would be a \\"fretboard\\" in an ordinary, stringed guitar. Starr labs recently introduced the Z5S, a simpler and less expensive version of the Z6S. MIDI guitar controllers have regained popularity due to the Z6 model, possibly because of its usage by Rob Swire of Pendulum, who uses it on songs where he is required to perform vocals. The You Rock Guitar, introduced in 2010 by You Rock Digital, combines a MIDI guitar controller/recorder with a patented touch-sensitive fingerboard and an on-board synthesizer. The instrument supports not only strumming and picking, but also tapping and sliding techniques, and provides a whammy bar for pitch bending and a modulation. The You Rock Guitar is used by guitarists such as George Pajon Jr. (Fergie, The Black Eyed Peas) and Josh Kelley. = Video game guitar controllers = Rock Band 3 (2010) featured three guitar controllers. One was modeled after the Fender Mustang, with six string sensors stretching from the bridge to the location of the neck pickup of a standard guitar, and 102 buttons in 6 columns of 17 frets, which together create MIDI note data. A second was built with Fender as a fully functional guitar, with a bridge pickup \\"listening\\" to the strings and sending MIDI information to the MIDI port. \\"You Rock Guitar\\" is compatible with Guitar Hero and Rock Band 3, including RB 3 Pro Mode. The guitar provides a number of features intended to help gamers become guitarists. The You Rock Practice Mode provides audible feedback when the user plays with the guitar's built-in song loops. The guitar can simultaneously drive a game system, an amplifier, headphones, a MIDI synthesizer, and music software via USB. = Pros and cons = The advantages of the guitar-like MIDI controller systems are that the tracking [the speed and accuracy of the notes the instrument produces] is much better than guitar-based systems, which means that there is no noticeable latency or pitch glitches. As well, whammy bars and other controllers can be assigned to any MIDI function, which gives the performer more on-stage control of their sound. Further, these controllers offer playing options, such as the keyboard-like tapping style, that are not possible on traditional guitars. Finally, the instruments with touch-sensitive fingerboards never need tuning, and they are easier on the fingers of beginning and casual players. The disadvantages for guitar players are that the controller is not exactly a guitar, and the feel is different. Some instruments are rare and expensive, which may make it difficult to repair or service them.  Musicians  Line 6 Variax modeling guitar A number of well-known guitarists have used guitar synthesizers, often working in the jazz or progressive rock genres, or soundtrack composition.

He won the 1948 Caldecott Medal for picture books and in 1968 he was a highly commended runner-up for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award for children's illustrators. Life Duvoisin was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1900. He learned to draw early having been encouraged by his father, who was an architect, and his godmother, a well-known painter of enamels. He studied at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris. His first job was designing scenery, making posters, and painting murals. He also became a manager of an old French pottery plant before becoming involved with textile design, an occupation that eventually brought him to the United States. He married Louise Fatio, another artist from Switzerland. In 1927, they moved to New York City where he worked on children's books and magazine illustrations. He became an American citizen in 1938.Crocus (1977), cover. The Bodley Head Ltd: London, Sydney, Toronto, . Duvoisin died in June 1980.

So the cheerleaders turn to their arch social enemies, the computer geeks, to help them learn Ninja abilities and defeat the evil Catholic Girls, Stephen and the mysterious Mr. X.

Until 1880, it was also known as the American Journal of Science and Arts, but its focus was always on natural sciences and especially on geology and related subjects. In early years, the journal was often referred to as \\"Silliman's Journal\\", and the publication became associated with Yale University due to his long tenure there (1804‚Äì1853). The editorship long remained in the family of Professor Silliman, as he was assisted by his son, Benjamin Silliman, Jr., from 1838. On the death of the elder Silliman in 1864, he was succeeded as chief editor by his son-in-law, James Dwight Dana, and then from 1895 till 1926 by Dana's son Edward Salisbury Dana. Associate editors included the botanist Asa Gray and the zoologist Louis Agassiz. The current editors are C. Page Chamberlain, a professor at Stanford University, and Danny M. Rye and Mark T. Brandon, professors of geology at Yale University.

This salt is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, who, in the early 1830s, first reported the compound. The compound has an unusual structure, consisting of a chain of platinum atoms, and it exhibits unusual properties, being dark green, which is very unusual for platinum compounds. Structure This species has been of interest in materials chemistry and solid-state physics because of its one-dimensional structure. It contains a linear chain of alternating [PtCl4]2‚àí anions and [Pt(NH3)4]2+ cations, in which the platinum atoms are separated by 3.25 √Ö. It is a semi-conductor. Preparation The compound may be prepared by combining aqueous solutions of [Pt(NH3)4]2+ and [PtCl4]2‚àí, which gives a deep green solid precipitate. Under some conditions, this reaction affords a pink polymorph of Magnus's green salt. In this so-called \\"Magnus's pink salt\\", the square planar Pt complexes are not stacked. Related compounds Magnus's green salt has the same empirical formula as cis-PtCl2(NH3)2 (\\"Peyrone chloride\\") and trans- PtCl2(NH3)2. These cis and trans compounds are molecules, whereas Magnus's green salt is a polymer. This difference is manifested by the solubility of the molecular complexes in water, whereas Magnus's green salt is insoluble. Soluble analogues of Magnus's green salt can be prepared by replacing the ammonia with ethylhexylamine. The corresponding palladium compound ([Pd(NH3)4PdCl4]) is known as \\"Vauquelin‚Äôs salt\\". History Magnus's green salt was one of the first examples of a metal ammine complex. Ammonia species are very common now: they were the basis of Alfred Werner's discoveries.

An early origin tale known as Conall Corc and the Corco Lo√≠gde, which survives only as part of the Irish genealogical tract in MS Laud 610, includes a few brief notes on the saint. This text was probably written at St Colm√°n's foundation of Cloyne and though it cannot be precisely dated, a rough approximate of c. 700 or earlier has been suggested.√ì Corr√°in, \\"Creating the past\\"; Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 522-3 Background Irish genealogies generally agree that Colm√°n had a father called L√©n√≠n. Through his father, Colm√°n appears to have been descended from the Rothrige, an obscure people who are known elsewhere as a subject people of the D√©isi of Munster.Corr√°in, \\"Creating the past\\" Irish genealogies, however, go some way to associating Colm√°n's lineage with the √âoganachta, the leading ruling dynasty in Munster. One early item of genealogical information, which specifically identifies the Mac L√©n√≠ni and Mac Duinich as sub-branches of the Rothrige (though it does not name Colm√°n), achieves this by making their eponymous progenitor Eochaid Roth√°n a son of the √âoganacht ancestor Mug Nuadat. The saint's genealogies later come to trace Colm√°n's ancestry to Mug Nuadat through seven generations. This prominence accorded to the √âoganachta in the genealogies is to be seen in the light of Colm√°n's monastic career and the position of Cloyne after his death (see below). The text Conall Corc and the Corco Lo√≠gde includes a brief triad in which Colm√°n is named as one of the three \\"ex-laymen\\" (athl√°ich) of Ireland, along with √ânna of Aran and M√≥chammac of Inis Celtra (though it also adds a fourth, Bishop Erc in Sl√°ne of Mag Breg).Conall Corc and the Corco Lo√≠gde, tr. Hull, p. 900. The use of the word athl√°ech here has been taken to suggest that Colm√°n became a cleric at a somewhat later age than was usual at the time.Busse, \\"Colm√°n mac L√©n√©ni\\" Later tradition claims that it was the Connacht saint Brendan of Clonfert who finally persuaded him to do so. Cloyne Colm√°n is remembered as the founder of the monastery at Cluain Uama, now Cloyne (Co. Cork, Ireland), in Munster, which lay in the kingdom of the U√≠ Liath√°in and the U√≠ Meic Caille, a sept of the former.Charles-Edwards, Early christian Ireland, p. 536, note 45, and 547-8. The origin legend Conall Corc and the Corco Lo√≠gde claims that the land for the foundation was not given by the local king, but by Coirpre (Crom) mac Crimthainn (d. c. 580), who was king of Munster from the E√≥ganacht Glendamnach:The E√≥ganacht Glendamnach were a branch claiming descent from Nad Fro√≠ch, as did the E√≥ganacht of Cashel and the √âoganacht √Åine. :Coirpre mac Crimthainn it was who gave Cloyne to God and to Colman mac Colcon who is also called Mac L√©n√©ne and Aired Cechtraige and Cell N√°ile. Because of this they [the Eoganacht Glendamnach] are entitled to secular rule. Aired Cechtraige has been identified as the later parish of Erry in the barony of Middlethird, and Cell N√°ile as that of Killenaule, in the barony of Ardagh, both in the diocese of Cashel. The same text alludes to Colm√°n's conflicts with other rulers. Colm√°n and his brothers are said at one time to have been expelled from Maethalach by M√°el Umai, the son of Coirpre's brother Fiachna Onchind; for this reason, his descendants were forever excluded from royal rule.Conall Corc and the Corco Lo√≠gde, tr. Hull, p. 903. Earlier in the text, Colm√°n is also said to have uttered a curse (maledictio) which brought down the walls of the city of Ress or Ressad. According to Paul MacCotter, Ress(ad) appears to be \\"an archaic name for U√≠ Chairpre or one of its divisions\\",MacCotter, Medieval Ireland, p. 185. the U√≠ Chairpre being a prominent sept of the U√≠ Fidgenti in Co. Limerick. Cloyne appears to have been his earliest settlement. The cathedral and round tower are situated on a limestone eminence in the midst of the valley, surrounded by rich meadows. In the rock is the cave extending in various branches underground to a great distance, from which the town derives its name. Here it is supposed Colman took up his abode as a place of security and the remains of his primitive oratory, known as Colman's Chapel were still to be seen in 1813. Colm√°n is also believed to have founded a monastery at what would become Killagha Abbey in County Kerry.James Carmody, 'The Abbey of Killagha, Parish of Kilcoleman, County Kerry', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fifth Series, Vol. 36, No. 3, 285 Further details of his life are not documented in writing but the connection of many places in counties Cork and Limerick with his name to this day proves the reality of his labours. The tenth-century Triads describes Cloyne as an important law school. Poet He was credited with extraordinary poetic powers, being styled by his contemporaries 'royal poet of Munster'. Several of his Irish poems are still extant, notably a metrical panegyric on Saint Brendan. Colgan mentions a metrical life of Saint Senan by him. It is unclear whether he was brought up as a Christian, but what is sure is that he was educated and became a bard or file, which required a special education - (in order to reach the highest level of file 12 years of study were required.) As a member of the class of fil√≠, he became attached to the court of Cashel where he remained until about the age of 48 years. In 570 he and Saint Brendan of Clonfert were said to have settled a dispute between rivals to the throne of Cashel and Aodh Caomh was acknowledged as king - the first Christian king of Cashel. The King was installed by Saint Brendan. During the time of the coronation Colman and some others discovered the lost shrine of Ailbhe of Emly. Brendan said that it was not right that the hands which had held this sacred relic should be defiled henceforth, thus it was that the son of Leinin offered himself to God. Brendan blessed him and gave him the name Colm√°n, which is a diminutive of Colm. The Gaelic word colm corresponds to the Latin columba (dove). Colman then went to the school of Saint Iarlaithe of Tuam and after his studies he is next mentioned as preaching to the heathen population in the east of County Cork. He is described as a \\"religious and holy presbyter, who afterwards became a famous bishop\\". The Prince of D√©ise, in the present County of Waterford, presented his child to Colman for baptism. Colman baptized him Declan and urged his parents to educate him well in his faith. This child became Saint Declan. Colman was given churches in Erry and Killenaule (4 and 10 miles from Cashel respectively) by Coirpre Cromm mac Crimthainn, King of Munster (Cashel), as well as lands in Cloyne, Co. Cork. It may well be that the lands in Cloyne (Cluain Uama, the lawn of the cave), were conquered lands and to prevent the possibility of reconquest were given to the church. The Cloyne estate was large and contained some of the best land in the area. After the king's death (c. 580) Colman somehow became involved in factional strife between Coirpre's descendants in which some of them persecuted him while others, the ancestors of the later dominant line, protected him. =Extant verse= His surviving verses date from the period 565 and 604, and are among the earliest examples of Irish writing in the Latin alphabet.Welsh, Oxford Concise Companion to Irish Literature He is commonly thought to have composed Luin oc laib, a poem in praise of Domnall mac Muirchertaig (d. 566?), king of Tara'Three Old Irish Accentual Poems', by James Carney in √âriu Journal, Vol. 22 (1971), p. 64+ and another poem on the death of √Åed Sl√°ine (d. 604), king of the U√ç N√©ill. The latter poem has not survived complete. Veneration He died on 24 November (his subsequent feastday), circa 600, and his probable place of burial is Cloyne, where he may have left a school of poetry in existence. The calendars are unanimous in dating his death on 24 November, now his feast day. Patron Saint of the Diocese of Cloyne and of its cathedral in C√≥bh. A different Saint Colman is also venerated on the same day, as recorded by Saint Aengus in his \\"Felire\\": ‚Äì Mac Lenine the most excellent With Colman of Duth-chuilleann. Saint Colman lived in a time for which we have very little written history. The received picture of Colman Mac Leinin comes to us from nineteenth and twentieth century Hagiographies.

His son, Ronald Rashkow, bought out the single store operation in 1967 from his father. He converted the company to Handy Andy in 1971 with its first expansion unit. The company grew to 72 stores in seven American states (Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan, Tennessee, and Kentucky). At its peak, the company had approximately 11,000 employees and annual revenue of $750 million. The company's core product mix included hardware, lumber, building materials, home decor, kitchen/bath and lawn/garden. The stores were highly visible and well known for their very large vertical stripes of brown and white that would typically cover the entire building.  Acquisitions  In 1979, Handy Andy acquired four Republic Lumber store locations from Jewel Food Stores in the Chicago market. In 1986, Handy Andy acquired six Mr. HOW stores from Nashville, Tennessee-based Service Merchandise in the Chicago area. The stores were later renamed.HighBeam In 1987, Handy Andy acquired the Forest City lumber chain with stores in Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois from Forest City Enterprises. In 1989, Handy Andy acquired 21 Central Hardware store locations in Missouri, Kentucky, and Ohio plus Witte Wholesale Hardware from Interco.  Bankruptcy  Handy Andy declared bankruptcy on October 17, 1995, due to creditor pressures, which led to the closure of about 20 of its stores. At that time, Handy Andy had over $120 million in debt and was planning to reorganize into hardware supermarkets. In early 1996, however, creditors forced Handy Andy to liquidate its assets to repay its outstanding debts. On January 25, 1996, Handy Andy announced it would be closing its remaining 54 stores, laying off over 2,500 employees. By June 1996, Handy Andy Home Improvement Centers had ceased to exist. Richard George was president of Handy Andy Home Improvement Centers. He was at the helm at the time of Handy Andy's bankruptcy on October 17, 1995, and for the company's closure in June 1996.

The company produces new versions of the DHC-6 Twin Otter, upgraded versions of the DHC-2 Beaver, spare parts for older de Havilland Canada aircraft, and components for Bell Helicopter Textron. Its President and CEO since at least May 2005 is David Curtis. The company is managed by Longview Aviation Capital. Longview Aviation is owned by Sherry Brydson, granddaughter of deceased newspaper magnate Roy Thomson and cousin of David Thomson, the largest family fortune in Canada.  History  The company was established in 1970 by founder, Norwegian-born Canadian aviation pioneer Nils Christensen, doing overhaul, maintenance and conversions to all types of aircraft but specializing in flying boats. In 1983, Christensen acquired the exclusive rights from de Havilland Canada to manufacture spare parts and to distribute the DHC-2 Beaver and the DHC-3 Otter aircraft. He retired as president of Viking Air in 1987. Acquisitions =Acquisition of de Havilland Canada designs: DHC-1 through DHC-7= In May 2005, the company subsequently purchased the parts and service business for all the older de Havilland Canada aircraft from Bombardier Aerospace. On February 24, 2006, Viking purchased the type certificates from Bombardier for all the discontinued de Havilland Canada designs: the DHC-1 Chipmunk, DHC-2 Beaver, DHC-3 Otter, DHC-4 Caribou, DHC-5 Buffalo, DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7, giving Viking Air the right to manufacture new aircraft if a market should arise for such. Restart of DHC production First flight of the Series 400 on October 1, 2008 On April 2, 2007, Viking announced that, nineteen years after being discontinued, with 27 orders and options in hand, it was restarting production of the Twin Otter with more powerful Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34/35 engines.Viking restarts Twin Otter production April 2, 2007 The first flight of the Series 400 technical demonstrator took place on October 1, 2008 at Victoria International Airport.First Flight For New Twin Otter A \\"Boring\\" Success October 01, 2008 In February 2010 the first new production Twin Otter Series 400 equipped with Honeywell's Primus Apex IFR digital flight deck and configured with a commuter interior took its first flight.First Flight For New Twin Otter AvFlash News, February 27, 2010 The DHC-6-400 series Twin Otter design has all around better performance, it includes more power, space, and now can haul up to 4,280 lbs of freight. Viking Air also produces upgraded DHC-2 Beavers fitted with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 turboprop engine called the DHC-2T Turbo Beaver. In December 2008, Viking Air indicated their intention to put the DHC-5 Buffalo series back into production in Canada at their home factory in North Saanich or in Calgary, Alberta. A potential new production Buffalo would have had Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150 turboprops, a glass cockpit, enhanced vision and night vision goggle capability. The company proposed the aircraft as a replacement for the Royal Canadian Air Force fleet of existing DHC-5As but the aircraft was not included in the final assessment in 2016 which chose the EADS CASA C-295.Niles, Russ. \\"Viking Proposes Resurrection Of DHC-5 Buffalo\\". avweb.com, December 2008. Retrieved: 13 September 2009.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fixed-wing-search-planes-1.3885653 In September 2017, Viking Air announced that it would begin talking to potential customers interested in the CL-415 \\"SuperScooper\\" Waterbomber aircraft, with the potential of the company reviving production of the aircraft if it finds demand. =Further type certificate acquisitions= In 2006, Viking Air acquired the type certificate for the Trident TR-1 Trigull since 2006, along with the three prototypes built. On June 20, 2016, Viking announced the acquisition of the worldwide amphibious aircraft program from Bombardier, including the type certificate for the CL-215, CL-215T and CL-415 Waterbombers. The acquisition was finalised on 3 October. On 29 May 2018, five CL-415 were sold to US firefighting company Bridger Aerospace, Longview then expected to recruit 200 workers in Calgary for the conversions. =Dash-8 acquisition= On 8 November 2018, Viking Air parent Longview Aviation acquired the Bombardier Dash 8 program and the de Havilland brand from Bombardier to continue Q400 production, in Downsview until the lease ends in 2021, in a deal that closed in the second half of 2019, bringing together all of the DHC type certificates under one umbrella once again. Bombardier announced the sale was for $300 million, and expects $250 million net. After the deal, Longview will have $1 billion (US$670 million) in annual sales and 1,800 workers in Victoria, Calgary and Toronto. By November 2018 the sales of the higher-performance Q400 were slower than the cheaper ATR Aircraft. In January 2019, parent company Longview announced that it would establish a new company in Ontario, under the de Havilland Aircraft Company of Canada name, to continue production of the Bombardier Dash 8 line. The Dash 8 acquisition will vault Longview from 600-700 employees to up to 2,000 including the CL-415 new production. After Bombardier sold the Q400 plant in Downsview, Ontario, Longview has three years to find a new location in Ontario where production should stay with 1,000 people.

It's an agricultural town (its main product is rice). Gravellona Lomellina borders the following municipalities: Cassolnovo, Cilavegna, Tornaco, Vigevano. History Heraldic emblem of the Barbavara family The very first traces of a settlement in this location date from the late Bronze Age, with the pre-Celtic Golasecca culture. Toponomy could be from the etruscan. A Roman settlement is testified by some traces such as two coffins and some coins from the first Empire period. According to tradition, before the Battle of Ticinus, Hannibal built the carthaginean camp amongst the nowadays towns of Gravellona, Cassolnovo and Piccolini, hamlet of Vigevano. During the middle ages, Gravellona belongs to the archbishop of Novara, who gaves executive power to Ingone. In 1152, Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa confirm feudal power to the \\"Barbavara\\" family, from Valsesia. They ruled Gravellona until 1797. Gravellona came under the control of Pavia probably in 1164, and in 1250, the list of lands Pavia, it appears like Gravalona. In 1332 the castle of the counts in Gravellona, however, belong to Cavallazzi family, which, together with Barbavara and Tornielli, are the oldest feudal lords of Gravellona. In 1581, the population gravellonese stood about 1000 inhabitants. In 1532 Gravellona (who had since returned to the County of Novara) was joined to the new province of the County of Vigevano or Vigevanasco . In 1543, with the Vigevanasco, was absorbed from the domains of Savoy, which since 1707 owned Lomellina. In 1818 the Vigevanasco was reunited with Lomellina, which in 1859 became part of the province of Pavia. Although in the province of Pavia, on the border of the Diocese of Vigevano, Gravellona belongs to the Diocese of Novara. Economy The main sector of the economy (as also of the neighboring municipalities of Lomellina) is agriculture. An intense rice cultivation is allowed by the flow of water, in particular from the Canal Quintino Sella. Other productions include poplars and corn. There is also a small industrial area. Culture Starting from 1992, on the first weekend of June, Festival of Arts is a festival all around Gravellona, with some folkloristic and artistical events, and a brand new stationary work of art every year. Works exhibited include frescos and murals, shapes in wrought iron on the roofs, mosaics on the pavements and others.

Life Colman was a native of Dalriada, born roughly a generation after Patrick's apostolate to Ireland, and was baptized by a bishop, bearing his own name who was also his uncle. It is believed that Colman was educated at the monastic foundation at Nendrum, on the shores of Strangford Lough, which had been established by Saint Caol√°n (Mochaoi) sometime earlier.McMahon, Andrew. \\"Parish of Dromore\\", The Diocese of Dromore Colman was a disciple of Caol√°n when the latter ruled as Abbot of Nendrum about 520.Murray, Henry. \\"Saint Colman of Dromore\\", Dromore Historical Journal, Dromore and District Local Historical Group, 1992 Tradition has it that Caol√°n was so impressed with Colman's potential as a Christian apostle and with his charism for performing miracles that he sent him to visit various other monasteries so that he might learn from the religious practices and forms of community life he would encounter there and enjoy the opportunity of more extensive learning, especially in Holy Scripture. To perfect his knowledge of the Scriptures St. Colman went to the great school of Emly, c. 470 or 475, and remained there some years. At length he returned to Mahee Island to see his old master, St. Mochae, and remained under his guidance for a long period, acting as assistant in the school. Among his many pupils at Mahee Island, in the first quarter of the sixth century, was St. Finnian of Moville.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Colman.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 21 Jul. 2013 He was the first abbot of Muckmore, in County Antrim, and afterwards was persuaded by Saint Mac Nissi to settle at Dromore.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Vol. VI, 1866 Colman set up a small wattle and daub church on this site around 514, probably thatched with reeds from the River Lagan which flows beside it. His followers observed a very strict rule of discipline. St. Finnian, who later established a monastery at Movilla, about five miles from Bangor, is believed to have been a former monk of Dromore. During Colman's lifetime the abbey came to enjoy the status of an Episcopal See and so Colman possibly finished his days not just as Abbot of Dromore, but also as Bishop. St. Colman is said to have baptised Saint Decl√°n of Ardmore. Veneration His feastday is on 7 June. Patronage Colman is the principal patron of the Diocese of Dromore. Legacy St.Colman's College was founded by Fr. J.S. Keenan in William Street, Newry in 1823 as the Dromore Diocesan Seminary. Known throughout Ireland as Violet Hill, the College has occupied its rural setting since 1829.

It was written by Scott James Remnant, a former employee of Canonical Ltd.  Rationale  The traditional init process was originally only responsible for bringing the computer into a normal running state after power-on, or gracefully shutting down services prior to shutdown. As a result, the design is strictly synchronous, blocking future tasks until the current one has completed. Its tasks must also be defined in advance, as they are limited to this prep or cleanup function. This leaves it unable to handle various non-startup-tasks on a modern desktop computer elegantly, including: * The addition or removal of USB flash drives and other portable storage or network devices while the machine is running * The discovery and scanning of new storage devices, especially when a disk may not even power on until it is scanned * The loading of firmware for a device, which may need to occur after it is detected but before it is usable Upstart's event-driven model allows it to respond to events asynchronously as they are generated.  Design  Upstart operates asynchronously; it handles starting of the tasks and services during boot and stopping them during shutdown, and also supervises the tasks and services while the system is running. Easy transition and perfect backward compatibility with sysvinit were the explicit design goals; accordingly, Upstart can run unmodified sysvinit scripts. In this way it differs from most other init replacements (beside systemd and OpenRC), which usually assume and require complete transition to run properly, and do not support a mixed environment of traditional and new startup methods. Upstart allows for extensions to its event model through the use of initctl to input custom, single events, or event bridges to integrate many or more- complicated events. By default, Upstart includes bridges for socket, dbus, udev, file, and dconf events; additionally, more bridges are possible.  Adoption  Linux distributions and other operating systems based on the Linux kernel which use Upstart as the default init system: * Upstart is used in Google's Chrome OS and Chromium OS. Linux distributions that support or have supported Upstart to some extent, but moved away since or no longer use it as their default init system: * Debian decided that systemd will be the default init system beginning with the Jessie release, after considering switching to Upstart. It was eventually removed from the Debian archives in December 2015. * Upstart was first included in Ubuntu in the Ubuntu 6.10 \\"Edgy Eft\\" release in late 2006, replacing sysvinit. Ubuntu 9.10 \\"Karmic Koala\\" introduced native Upstart bootup as of Alpha 6. In turn, after the Debian project decided to adopt systemd on a future release in 2014, Mark Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu would begin plans to migrate to systemd itself to maintain consistency with upstream. Ubuntu finished the switch to systemd as its default init system in version 15.04 (Vivid Vervet), with the exception of Ubuntu Touch. * In Fedora 9, Upstart replaced sysvinit, however, systemd replaced Upstart in the Fedora 15 release. * Red Hat includes Upstart in their Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 release. As a result, it is also used by RHEL 6 variants such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Oracle Linux. For RHEL 7, systemd is used instead. * openSUSE included Upstart in version 11.3 Milestone 4, but not as default. systemd replaced Upstart, as the default init system in openSUSE 12.1. * Upstart is used in HP's webOS for the Palm Pre, Palm Pixi (both before Palm was bought out by HP), HP Veer, and HP Pre 3 smart phones, along with the HP TouchPad tablet. * Upstart replaced the sysvinit in Maemo 5 for Nokia Internet tablets.

It was written and drawn by Don Rosa, based on a small item appearing in an earlier story by Carl Barks. The story is reprinted in volume 1 of The Don Rosa Library, The Son of the Sun. Plot The story starts with Donald and his nephews reading an ad about the Oolated Squigg company and its second annual contest. The first prize is a south seas cruise on an ocean liner, which Donald wants to win. It will be difficult, since Gladstone Gander also wants the prize. The rules say there is no limit for the number of entries each contestant may submit, so Donald intends to pick all entry forms to make sure Gladstone and his luck won't stop him. Picking the entries won't be as easy as it's originally thought. The company decided to send the 10,000 entry forms inside squigg-shaped balloons through Duckburg. Still determined to get all the raffle tickets within the balloons, Donald tries to grab them as soon they are released. Unfortunately, it causes Donald to float away with the balloons. The nephews point out a balloon floating near Gladstone, who doesn't want to make the effort of lifting his arm to get it, saying that either a bird will pop the balloon for him or it simply doesn't have the winning ticket. Eventually, Donald seems to have caught all the balloons, which, as he points out, must have been placed together via a thermal inversion, meaning they must be floating above a place with a low temperature. The place happens to be the Money Bin. Scrooge McDuck, fearing the balloons could be another plot of the Beagle Boys trying to steal his money, shoots them down. As a multitude tries to get the entry forms, Scrooge, who doesn't know about the contest, tries to get them out of Killmotor Hill. When he hears about a contest, the idea of paying more taxes because of the prizes horrifies Scrooge to the point where he agrees to give the balloons to the first one who claims them. Donald, who was under all the balloons, claims them all for himself and heads for the Oolated Squigg company to claim his prize. As they arrive at the company, the contest organizers are shocked by the idea of one person having all the tickets, but Huey, Dewey, and Louie say there are only 9,999 of the 10,000 ballons. Donald doesn't like the way it sounds, specially with Gladstone in the vicinity. One of the organizers says that a single entry got stuck in the factory and never was released. Donald tries to get it before Gladstone, but trips and accidentally kicks the ticket right to Gladstone's hands. Donald asks what Gladstone was doing there, since he had no entries, and he says the last year's winner gets to draw the winning ticket for this one. Hearing this, Huey, Dewey, and Louie figure a way to make Gladstone's luck work against him. They submit only one ticket in the name of Donald. All others are for Gladstone. While Gladstone is picking the winning ticket, the nephews comment about Gladstone's luck beating the odds. That's when Gladstone figures out their plan: They've put the odds for him and against Donald so Gladstone would be beaten by his own luck. The plan seems to work, as Donald wins the cruise and Gladstone gets a one-year supply of oolated squiggs as the second-placer. While trying to enjoy his \\"prize\\", Gladstone thinks about the contest and deduces that losing a contest is bad luck, regardless of for or against whom the odds were. Then he reads an article in the newspaper about the cruise ship getting grounded on an iceberg, and he later finds a diamond ring eaten by a squigg. The story ends with Donald on the iceberg, having nothing to eat except squiggs recently fished from there.

Main focus of NIUIP is to address the persistent urban decay and research in improvement of urban infrastructure of Pakistan.  History  In December 2003, Professor Haider, attended the Urban Research Symposium in Washington, DC, which was organized by the World Bank. The interactions with urban planners and engineers from the developing countries gave birth to the idea of establishing a new infrastructure planning institute in Pakistan. Later in June and July 2004, Professor Haider visited the National Institute of Urban Affairs, India and the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, India, both located in New Delhi, to learn from the experience of Indian planners. Professor Haider contacted UET Peshawar and the HEC with suggestions to address Pakistan‚Äôs urban challenges in a systematic manner. Dr. Sohail Naqvi, Executive Director of the HEC, was equally concerned about the urban decay in Pakistan. Professor Haider, who specializes in urban planning and is also an alumnus of UET Peshawar, offered his assistance and Canadian expertise in establishing a National Institute of Urban Infrastructure Planning to be based at UET Peshawar. HEC engaged Professor Haider under the reverse brain drain program to develop the detail proposal for NIUIP. In the start of 2005 HEC approved the proposal and NIUIP was formally established at UET, Peshawar.  Objectives  Main objectives of formation of NIUIP are to: * Undertake research in challenges faced by rapidly deteriorating urban centers of Pakistan * Transform it into a centre of excellence for research and training in urban infrastructure planning in Pakistan * Train and educate Doctoral and Master students by providing opportunities for research in an applied and problem-solving environment * Train planning professionals * Develop collaboration with other such international research institutes  Research linkages  In September 2005, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between McGill and NIUIP, UET Peshawar for cooperation through activities as: * Exchange of faculty and/or staff * Joint research activities and publications * Participation in seminars and academic meetings * Special short-term academic programs  Faculty development and research areas  Initial research focus of NIUIP is in: * Infrastructure finance and planning * Urban transportation planning * Urban environment and energy planning * Water supply and sanitation * Solid waste management * Spatial modeling and GIS  References  * Reginomics Projects * NIUIP PC1 * MoU between McGill and UET, Peshawar * UET, Peshawar *University of Engineering and Technology (Peshawar) * Prof. Murtaza Haider's Resume Category:Urban planning in Pakistan Category:University of Engineering & Technology, Peshawar ","title":"National Institute of Urban Infrastructure Planning"},{"id":"6707395","text":"AquaNox is a series of submarine-based first-person shooter/simulation video games set in the distant future. The collection includes AquaNox, AquaNox 2: Revelation and AquaNox: The Angel's Tears. The predecessor and the starter of the series is the MS-DOS title Archimedean Dynasty. Concept In the middle of the 22nd century, raw materials on Earth became increasingly scarce and as the end of the resources loomed, people began to prospect for resources on the ocean floor. This resulted in the construction of mining stations beneath the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. Many countries set up these deep-sea stations where workers and engineers extracted the oceans' treasures. Nevertheless, the output was far from enough to cover an ever-increasing demand. When the natural resources on Earth's surface were depleted, a time of destruction and wars began. In the fight over the planet's last remaining resources, alliances fell apart, countries became hostile and old conflicts flared up. With increasing cruelty and senselessness, man destroyed the very basis of life on the surface of the earth. After a series of resource wars, nuclear weapons completed the destruction that man had not yet finished with his industrial pollution. When the last glimmer of hope for humanity's survival was extinguished, people fled into the depths of the oceans. The former extraction stations became the last refuge of those fortunate enough to be able to pay the price of entry into the underwater world. The poorest of the poor were left behind, condemned to die in a desolate world polluted by radioactivity. Life outside the oceans became impossible as the continents were flooded by rising sea levels and a harsh nuclear winter covered most of the oceans and the shrinking surface landmass of the planet with a layer of radioactive dust, snow and ice many meters thick. A 40-meter thick layer of dead organic matter, the so-called POM layer, covered the oceans. Not a single ray of sunlight penetrated the dense particulate layer that plunged the world into a darkness like none other. Nevertheless, mankind rose one last time to a new life, the only life, in a dead new world. This world was humanity's creation, and was now called Aqua. The following events take place in the middle of the 27th century. Today, in the year 2661, mankind lives in gigantic cities underwater. Aqua is divided into political power blocs, such as the Aquatoria of the capitalistic, democratically governed Atlantic Federation, the oligarchy of the Arabic Clans Union and the monarchist Russo-Japanese Shogunate. In the South Pacific lies the Tornado Zone, stirred up by surface storms, where an anarchist pack of mercenaries, pirates, buccaneers and outlaws gathers, ever ready to sell their friends and their souls. A single company has long ago monopolized many industries necessary for human survival underwater‚ÄîEnTrOx, which stands for \\"Energy-Transportation-Oxygen\\". New technologies allow extremely fast underwater travel. However, many old technologies are lost or have become useless. For example, due to the high amounts of fallout in the atmosphere, satellite communication and global positioning are impossible, although some organizations are looking for ways to restore these abilities. The player's task is to complete a series of story-related combat missions. During the course of the missions additional support and story elements are revealed by the secondary characters. The enemies range from hostile vessels to alien or artificial life-forms such as Bionts. Episodes The Aquanox series include the following games, listed by release in chronological order: =Archimedean Dynasty= =AquaNox= The player once again jumps into the role of Emerald \\"Deadeye\\" Flint. After the Bionts are defeated, Flint goes back to being a mercenary as a leader of a Biont-hunting task force. Things turn for the worse when his submarine, the Succubus, is stolen on one of the stations. The game begins with one of Flint's dubious acquaintances giving him an old, barely working sub and several missions to get him started. Throughout the game, Flint earns money by completing missions, allowing him to purchase better subs, weapons and equipment. The new equipment appears throughout the game, available for purchase, as the player progress in the storyline. Generally speaking, the player is allowed to buy a new boat and a new set of weaponry per chapter. While on stations, Flint can speak with various characters in order to get new missions and deepen the atmosphere of the game. The former system of upgrading the vessel with a variety of defensive turrets has been simplified by fixing the player's view to the cockpit as well as permitting the usage of only two on-hull-installed cannons. As the result of this change, the controls of the submarine have been adapted to the first-person shooter's mouse-based layout, removing the need for the joystick, thus the game has compromised its tactical depth in order to increase the intensity of combat. This change has raised critique among the reviewers, stating that the developers' focus fell inadequately on the visual performance rather than the actual gameplay of its predecessor. The game was one of the first applications to fully use the T&L; effects by supporting the NVIDIA Geforce 3 Ti graphics accelerator. The game includes a vast amount of true information on oceans, such as origins of different species, their specifics and man's adaptation to submarine life. The game manual consists of two chapters explaining various terms and facts that have been mentioned throughout the course of the story. =AquaNox 2: Revelation= The plot of the game centers on William Drake, the last remnant of the old aristocratic, industrialist family. After the bankruptcy of the family business and the death of the protagonist's grandmother, young William Drake sets \\"sail\\" for open seas on the last freighter of Drake Enterprises. The cargo ship soon gets taken over by a group of mercenaries while Drake rushes out to answer a distress call. While sparing his life, the group of seven invaders seize control of the boat, thus binding Williams' fate to their own. Drake sees no other option but to ally himself with his new crew, hoping for the best. The game features a total of four unique, playable and upgradeable gunships. The player most likely switches boats depending on a given mission's parameters. While certain missions require speed and stealth, others virtually require a heavy arsenal and thick plating. The game features a large variety of projectile armament as well as a set of torpedoes and a collection of directed energy weaponry, including lasers and EMP launchers. The torpedo combat is similar to the missile engagements of most flight simulators and space shooters, where the pilot is expected to release flares and perform classic evasion manoeuvres. Traveling is generally a simple matter of following the navigation points spread out through the game. The ship's controls can be switched from the FPS mode to Simulation Mode via a predefined shortcut, where the latter steering scheme switches the horizontal scrolling of the mouse from turning the cockpit horizontally to rotating the hull around its axis. Reaching the surface is not possible due to the depth-range limitation, which binds the player to the underwater world yet gives certain disadvantages during combat. In response to criticisms of poor interaction with other characters in AquaNox, a new dialogue system was added in the sequel. Between missions, the player is able to initiate conversations while on board the freighter as well as in the oceanic cities. The initiation of the conversations is mandatory. However, due to the absence of interaction during the dialogues, the outcome of the game is not open-ended. The dialogue and characters are the focus of many reviewers' ire, who criticize it as poorly- written and ultimately pointless. =AquaNox: The Angel's Tears= AquaNox: The Angel's Tears is the PlayStation 2 remake of AquaNox 2: Revelation. The title did not pass Sony's software quality assurance test and as Massive Development had already been closed by JoWood Productions, the release was cancelled. =AquaNox: Deep Descent= At Gamescom 2014, Nordic Games presented a tech demo of a new iteration from the Aquanox series. The Nordic Games officials confirmed they were working on a new iteration of the game. The demo was created using Unreal Engine 3 and showed a bit of the environment and one ship model prototype along with a hangar interface. The game was successfully crowdfunded through Kickstarter on the 11th of September 2015 by amassing US$95,979, surpassing its US$75,000 goal. The game will be released on October 16, 2020 in stores and on Steam. The game is developed by Serbian studio Digital Arrow.Press release, 24 September 2020 References External links * * Official Aquanox Homepage of the publisher Jowood (archived 2011-07-13) * Official Aquanox 2 Homepage of the publisher Jowood (archived 2011-07-13) * AquaNox-Portal - Official AquaNox Series webpage from Massive Development (archived 2005-02-07) Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Submarine simulation video games Category:DOS games Category:1996 video games Category:2001 video games Category:2003 video games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Underwater civilizations in fiction Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Blue Byte games Category:THQ Nordic franchises Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games set in the 27th century ","title":"AquaNox"},{"id":"6707399","text":"Linarolo is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Pavia in the Italian region Lombardy, located about 35 km south of Milan and about 9 km east of Pavia.

It gives its name to the surrounding area, the Lomellina. Lomello borders the following municipalities: Ferrera Erbognone, Galliavola, Mede, Ottobiano, San Giorgio di Lomellina, Semiana, Velezzo Lomellina, Villa Biscossi. History Laumellum was a Roman mansio (a stopping place on a road) on the way of Via Regina, the main road connecting Ticinum (now Pavia) with Turin along the way of the Galliae. The archeological excavations made by the Universities of Pavia and of London during the latest years, brought to light inscriptions, cemeteries of the Imperial period, as well as ruins of fortifications and an entrance door in the boundary wall. Laumellum was perhaps a pre-Roman center of the Ligures. During the Lombard domination (569-774), Lomello began to know a considerable prosperity. This was the place where Queen Theodolinda, widow of Authari, married Agilulf, Duke of Turin, in 590. Queen Gundeberga, daughter of Theodolinda and wife of Arioald, after being charged with the betrayal of her husband, was imprisoned in a tower in 629 and released after three years, thanks to the first \\"Judgement of God\\" ever celebrated in Italy. In the Carolingian period, it was the place of a comitatus and in 1024 the fortress of Lomello was elected to the residence of the Palatine Counts while, in the same years, the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore was built as a mark of wealth and power. The commune of Pavia defeated the Counts in the 1140s and captured Lomello, owning it until 1360, when Lomello came under the domination of the Visconti, who were followed, from 1450 to 1535, by the Sforza. Francesco Sforza assigned the County of Lomello to the Crivellis, who held it continuously until 1760. Main sights *Remains of the medieval walls * First Romanesque Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (known from the 11th century). *Baptistery of San Giovanni ad fontes (5th-7th century), one of the few examples of Lombard architecture in northern Italy. *Romanesque church of San Michele (12th century), in Romanesque style with the exception of the Baroque fa√ßade. *The Castle (15th century). Situated on a hillock in the middle of the village, its origin dates back to the 11th century, when the Palatine Counts extended their domain over the whole region. Almost entirely re-built by Antonio Crivelli from 1450 on, it was completed by his successors and particularly by Alessandro who, after the death of his wife, took up the ecclesiastical career, becoming a Cardinal in 1565. He was the commissioner of the frescoes in the internal halls, which represent the Winds and the Zodiac in the vault, the monthly labours in the lunette. In the second hall are the Paradise of Dante and some episodes from S. Catherine's life. The entrance tower with the hints of the draw-bridge and of the ditch date to the Sforza period. The castle is home to the town hall. On its first floor in the halls of the Civic Library are the remains of a mosaic once belonging to a Roman villa, representing geometrical decorations, magical symbols and the head of a Gorgon.

She is known best as the author and illustrator of The Egg Tree, which won the 1951 Caldecott Medal for U.S. picture book illustration. Born into a Quaker family active in the printing industry in Philadelphia, Milhous is also known for her graphic designs for the Works Progress Administration(WPA). Her work has been exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Life Katherine Milhous was born November 27, 1894, to Osborn and Katherine Daly Milhous of Philadelphia, Quakers who made their living as printers. When she was young they moved to Pitman, New Jersey, a small camp-meeting town. She returned to Philadelphia to attend the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art. Milhous helped support her schooling by illustrating magazines. In 1934, while at the Academy of Fine Arts, she won the Cresson Traveling Fellowship, which allowed her to study overseas. She then returned to Philadelphia where, for forty years, she shared a studio with her partner and fellow-artist Frances Lichten. From 1935 to 1940 Milhous was a supervisor for the Philadelphia Federal Art Project (FAP), a branch of the Works Progress Administration. Among her duties was the creation of posters promoting Pennsylvania. She incorporated familiar Pennsylvania Dutch designs into her posters. Alice Dalgliesh, head of the Children's Book division of Charles Scribner's & Sons, saw Milhous' posters during an exhibition in an FAP gallery, and hired her as a staff designer. Milhous co-wrote and illustrated several books with Dalgliesh, who was also an award-winning children's writer. She also illustrated for others, as well as writing and illustrating her own books. Milhous was a member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. She died in Philadelphia on December 5, 1977. Her papers are held in the University of Minnesota Children's Literature Research Collection and the Free Library of Philadelphia's Children's Literature Research Collection. Critical reception Milhous' books were generally well received by reviewers, both for their writing and their illustrations. Appalonia's Valentine was called \\"distinguished‚Ä¶ original and beautiful\\". On Patrick and the Golden Slippers, about Philadelphia's Mummers' Parade, the same magazine wrote \\"This is a picture book of enduring value to young Americans.\\" In her Caldecott Medal-winning The Egg Tree, \\"Her use of bright tempera paints brought to life the bold borders and vibrant pages of the book.\\" Selected works =Written and illustrated= * Once on a Time (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1938), edited by Alice Dalgliesh and Katherine Milhous * Lovina: A Story of the Pennsylvania Country (Scribner, 1940) * Herodia, the Lovely Puppet (Scribner, 1942) * Corporal Keeperupper (Scribner, 1943) * The First Christmas Crib (Scribner, 1944) * Snow over Bethlehem (Scribner, 1945) * The Egg Tree (Scribner, 1950) * Patrick and the Golden Slippers (Scribner, 1951) * Appolonia‚Äôs Valentine (Scribner, 1954) * With Bells On: A Christmas Story (Scribner, 1955) * Through These Arches: The Story of Independence Hall (J.

In the game, the player controls Pac-Man as he must eat all of the dots while avoiding the colored ghosts that chase him in the maze. Eating large flashing \\"Power Pellets\\" will allow Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for bonus points, which lasts for a short period of time. A new feature to this game allows Pac-Man to jump over the ghosts to evade capture. It is the ninth title in the Pac-Man video game series and was the last one developed for arcades up until the release of Pac-Man Arrangement in 1996. Development was directed by Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani. It was licensed to Atari Games for release in North America. Pac-Mania gained a highly-positive critical reception for its uniqueness and gameplay. It was nominated for \\"Best Coin-Op Conversion of the Year\\" at the Golden Joystick Awards in 1987, although it lost to Taito's Operation Wolf. The game sold 1,412 arcade cabinets in North America by the end of 1987, grossing around $2.82 million ($6.22 million adjusted for inflation). Pac-Mania was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the Atari ST, MSX2, Sega Genesis and Nintendo Entertainment System, the last of which being published by Tengen. Several Pac-Man and Namco video game collections also included the game. Ports for the Wii Virtual Console, iOS and mobile phones were also produced. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Pac-Mania is an isometric maze game. The player controls Pac-Man, a yellow circular creature that must eat all of the pellets in each stage while avoiding the five colored ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde and Sue. Eating large Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue and flee, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points and send them to the house in the middle of the stage. Clearing the stage of pellets will allow Pac-Man to move to the next. New to this game is the ability to jump over the ghosts, allowing Pac-Man to evade capture by the ghosts. Later areas of the game will introduce two new ghosts - the green ghost Funky and the steel gray ghost Spunky - which also have the ability to jump. While Pac-Man can still jump over Funky, it is impossible to jump over Spunky. Eating a certain number of pellets will cause a bonus items to appear in the middle of the stage, which Pac-Man can eat up for points. Some of these items will increase Pac-Man's movement speed or double the point values of blue ghosts. Ports Pac-Mania arrived on most of the 8-bit systems in 1988, and a very favourable home conversion appeared on the Commodore 64. The conversions were designed and ported by Teque Software, otherwise known as Peter Harrap (Monty Mole) and Shaun Hollingworth (ex-Gremlin), and the games were published by Grandslam Entertainment. A full screen 32-colour Commodore Amiga version was released in 1988 and highly rated, as was the X68000 version, and Acorn Archimedes. The 16-bit Atari ST conversion ran in 55% of the screen area, and used 16 colours. Pac-Mania was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990, and the Sega Genesis in 1991 by Tengen, with the NES version being unlicensed. Neither port was released in Japan. The NES port was outsourced to Westwood Associates and the Genesis port was outsourced to Sculptured Software. More recently, a port to the Atari STE, based on the ST version but modified to take advantage of the STE's features, was developed. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Pac-Mania on their December 15, 1987 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B-. The game was runner-up in the category of Best Coin-Op Conversion of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, behind Operation Wolf. Legacy The arcade version of Pac-Mania appeared in Namco Museum Volume 5, the 2001 Namco Museum release, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary and Namco Museum Virtual Arcade. In 2001, it was one of the games included in Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance. Later, in 2002, the arcade version was re-released and included as an unlockable bonus in Pac-Man World 2. In 2007, Pac-Mania was also released in Namco Museum Remix with Pac & Pal, Pac 'n Roll, Super Pac-Man and other non-Pac-Man games and was re-released in 2010 as part of the follow-up compilation Namco Museum Megamix, along with 17 other Namco arcade games and six remix games, five of which appeared in Namco Museum Remix. In 2010, the design of Pac-Man and the ghosts from Pac-Mania appear in Pac-Man Championship Edition DX and the game itself is released as an app in the App Store for iOS devices. Pac-Mania was also re-released as part of the Pac-Man's Arcade Party arcade machine in 2010 for Pac-Man's 30th anniversary. In February 2014 it was included in the Pac-Man Museum on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC Via Steam. In 2018, it was included in the Pac-Man's Pixel Bash arcade cabinet, along with other Pac-Man, and different Namco games. The music from Pac-Man's Park was later used in Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures as the \\"power up\\" theme for \\"Pac\\" (the show's version of Pac-Man). The same theme, along with Block Town's music, was remixed and used in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.

There she met Ines Cassettari, an immigrant from Italy who worked at the settlement.

Prentice was associated with the Hudson River School. Prentice grew up on a farm in Lewis County, New York By 1872, Prentice had traveled through the Adirondack Mountains, painting the views as well as the surrounding region. He opened his first studio as a landscape painter in Syracuse, New York in 1875. Self-taught artist Levi Wells Prentice is best known for his realistic still life compositions of fruit arranged within a landscape, or abundantly spilling from bushel baskets. Early in his career, he painted portraits and landscapes of the Adirondack Mountain region of Lewis County, New York, his birthplace. He followed a self-prescribed educational path, begun by the Hudson River School and reinforced by John Ruskin's (1819‚Äì1900) truth-to-nature principles laid out in his book Modern Painters. Although he can be allied to both schools of thought, Prentice can not be considered a member of either. This book has a photo of the artist in his early Brooklyn studio surrounded by his paintings and a complete essay on his life and work. Prentice then turned to painting still life subjects when he moved briefly to Brooklyn, New York in 1883, focusing on fruit, in order of frequency apples, strawberries, peaches, plums, raspberries, cherries, muskmelons, pears, currants, pineapples, gooseberries, grapes and bananas usually piled high in pots or in natural settings. Prentice married an English woman, Emma Roseloe Sparks, in Buffalo, New York in 1882 and had two children, Leigh (born March 22, 1887) and Imogene (born September 17, 1889). He moved around from 1903 to 1907 before settling in the Germantown district of Philadelphia. However, his work did not gain much recognition with historians until the 1970s. He was a member of the Brooklyn Art Association and frequently exhibited his paintings there. In addition to his artistic talents, he was a craftsman who enjoyed making his own brushes, palettes and frames. In his painting, Prentice placed an emphasis on dark outlining with a concern for textual precision, creating dramatic contrasts. The shift between dark background areas and the vibrant hues of the fruit are done to give the compositions an exciting, visual energy. The fruit is presented with clarity and precision. An emphasis appears to be placed on the idea of man versus nature. The wooden baskets with hand-wrought nails represent a structured, man-made object, while the overly ripe fruit represents the fleeting qualities of nature. These paintings also demonstrate Prentice's remarkable skills at rendering color, form, and texture. Art historian William H. Gerdts observed that there are several works by Prentice in which he achieves a quality of illusionism which is unsurpassed. In 1993, the skillful \\"illusionism\\" of Levi Wells Prentice was celebrated in a retrospective exhibition at the Adirondack Museum in New York. His works continue to be appreciated by modern collectors. He is represented in many museums including the New York State Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Montclair Art Museum, Philbrook Museum of Art, and Yale University Art Gallery. Prentice died November 28, 1935, in Germantown, Pennsylvania.

Economy is mostly based on agriculture, the main cultivation being that of rice. In recent years Met NewEn is forging ahead with the construction of its first wood biomass power plant in Italy. The 20 MW BiOlevano project is due to come on stream in the fourth quarter of 2011 at a cost of ‚Ç¨80 million. A key feature is the development of the wood-chip supply chain. A high proportion (more than 85%) of the plant's raw materials will come from a short supply chain. The BiOlevano unit features very high conversion efficiency (more than 30%) and extremely low emissions, lower than any other biomass power plant in Italy. The plant, designed to deliver 140 GWhe per year of renewable energy, sufficient to meet the needs of about 50,000 families, will consume approximately 200,000 tonnes/year of wood chips. These will come mainly from poplar trees grown according to the short rotation forestry (SRF) formula, defined as high-density plantations of fast-growing species to be used for energy conversion. Taking into account the carbon capture cycle of its raw materials, the Olevano plant will reduce atmospheric emissions of CO2 by more than 100,000 tonnes/year by replacing electricity generated from fossil fuels. History Located centrally in Lomellina, near the right bank of the Agogna, the village belonged to the Counts of Lomello. Some of them took up residence here and therefore received a title from the place. The feudal vassals, named thus Counts of Olevano, settled in an imposing, multi-towered castle probably built in the twelfth century, as we know that it was destroyed for the first time by Frederick Barbarossa. A second fortress was razed to the ground in 1404 by Facino Cane. A third reconstruction was finished in 1420. Part of the feud was given to the Attendolo-Bologninis by emperor Frederick III in 1469. In 1551 it passed down to the Beccarias for a short time. In 1557 the castle was once more nearly destroyed by the French troops, but a new fortified building sprang up from those ruins and was attacked for the last time in 1745 by the Austrian army. The first drastic changes followed and the edifice was transformed in appearance and lay-out. More alterations from the following century, and the first decades of the present one, have given the building its final appearance, which can be observed nowadays.

History  Oliva has been known since 972, when it was donated by Emperor Otto I to his daughter in law Theophano, who then in turn donated it (along with other properties in the nearby villages of Montalto and Mairano near Casteggio) to the monastery of Santa Maria delle Cacce in Pavia. Passed under the dominion of Pavia (1164), it was included in the podesteria (jurisdiction) of Montalto Pavese enfeoffed to the family Belcredi. The domain of the monastery continued, as mere possession of land, under the rule of the feudal lords of Montalto; before the seventeenth century the property was passed to the family Isimbardi of Pavia, vassals of the neighboring Santa Giuletta, who owned the castle and about two thirds of the lands of the village. With the extinction of the family Isimbardi in 1878, the property of the estate of Oliva passed to the De Benedetti family of Turin and then to another family from Milan. Between 1928 and 1946 the municipality was abolished and aggregated to Corvino San Quirico.

Sister Helen Prejean (Sarandon) establishes a special relationship with Matthew Poncelet (Penn), a character based on convicted murderers Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie. He is a prisoner on death row in Louisiana, and she visits him as his spiritual adviser after corresponding with him. Plot Matthew Poncelet has been in prison for six years, awaiting execution after being convicted and sentenced to death for killing a teenage couple. Poncelet, held in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, committed the crimes with Carl Vitello, a man who was sentenced to life imprisonment. As the day of his execution comes closer, Poncelet asks Sister Helen Prejean, with whom he has corresponded, to help him with a final appeal. She decides to visit him. He is arrogant, sexist, and racist and does not even pretend to feel remorse. He affirms his innocence and insists Vitello killed the two teenagers. Convincing an experienced attorney to take on Poncelet's case pro bono, Sister Helen tries to have his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. After many visits, she establishes a relationship with him. At the same time, she gets to know Poncelet's mother, Lucille, and the families of the two victims. The families do not understand Sister Helen's efforts to help Poncelet and claim that she is \\"taking his side.\\" Instead they desire \\"absolute justice,\\" his life for the lives of their children. Sister Helen's application for a pardon is declined. Poncelet asks Sister Helen to be his spiritual adviser through his execution, and she agrees. Sister Helen tells Poncelet that his redemption is possible only if he takes responsibility for what he did. Just before he is taken from his cell, Poncelet tearfully admits to Sister Helen that he had killed the boy and raped the girl. As he is prepared for execution, he appeals to the boy's father for forgiveness and tells the girl's parents that he hopes his death brings them peace. Poncelet is executed by lethal injection and given a proper burial. The murdered boy's father attends the funeral ceremony; although he is still filled with hate, he soon begins to pray with Sister Helen.
