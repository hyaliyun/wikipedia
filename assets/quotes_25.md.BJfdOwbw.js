The brother of the ispahbadh Dadhburzmihr, Farrukhan governed Tabaristan between 740/41 and 747/48 as regent for his underage nephew, Khurshid.  Biography  Map of Tabaristan and its neighbouring territories Farrukhan was the younger son of Farrukhan the Great (died ca. 728), the first ruler (ispahbadh) of the Dabuyid dynasty from whose reign coins are known.Rekaya (1986), pp. 68‚Äì70Pourshariati (2008), pp. 312‚Äì313 According to the traditional account, the Dabuyids had established themselves as the quasi-independent rulers of Tabaristan in the 640s, during the tumults of the Muslim conquest of Persia and the collapse of the Sassanid Empire. They owed only the payment tribute and nominal vassalage to the Arab Caliphate, and managed, despite repeated Muslim attempts at invasion, to maintain their autonomy by exploiting the inaccessible terrain of their country.Madelung (1975), pp. 198‚Äì199 A more recent interpretation of the sources by P. Pourshariati, however, supports that Farrukhan the Great was the one who actually established the family's rule over Tabaristan, sometime in the 670s.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 308‚Äì313 Farrukhan the Great was succeeded by his eldest son, Dadhburzmihr, who died in 740/41. He was succeeded by his son, Khurshid, but he was only six years old. Shortly before his death, Dadhburzmihr appointed Farrukhan the Little as regent until Khurshid came of age. Farrukhan effectively ruled Tabaristan for the next eight years, but this is not reflected in the coinage of the period, with coins struck solely in Khurshid's name from 741 on. Farrukhan's regency coincides with recorded attempts by the Dabuyids to strengthen their position vis-√°-vis the Umayyad Caliphate; they used the turmoil of the Third Fitna to rebel against Caliph Marwan II (r. 744‚Äì750), and even sent an embassy to the Tang court in 746, which recognized him (\\"king Hu-lu-ban\\") as a vassal prince. When Khurshid came of age, Farrukhan prepared to hand over power, but his own sons disagreed and tried to usurp the throne. Their plot was allegedly betrayed to Khurshid by a slave girl, Varmja Haraviya. With the help of the sons of another cousin, Jushnas, Khurshid managed to defeat and imprison Farrukhan's sons. He later took Varmja Haraviya as his wife, while the sons of Jushnas were given high positions in the state.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 313‚Äì314  References   Sources   Category:8th-century deaths Category:8th-century rulers in Asia Category:Regents Category:Year of birth unknown Category:8th-century Iranian people Category:Dabuyid dynasty Category:Persian people ","title":"Farrukhan the Little"},{"id":"39347097","text":"Ludwig Goldscheider (3 June 1896 ‚Äì 26 June 1973) was an Austrian-British publisher, art historian, poet and translator who is known for founding the world-renowned Phaidon Press.

This way of celebrating carnivals has attracted attention all over Europe. They are associated with the old tradition of the Basque Country and they have been celebrated in different ways since the age of the Roman Empire. Each village or city has a typical character and all the celebrations are associated with this character. They have had a lot of changes during the years in the costumes, rituals, meanings and ways to celebrate them. They have been also denounced several times, for example by Franco's dictatorship. But they always have been a very important part of the basque culture and it is also a symbol of it. Contents: Main characters Markitos This character is from Zalduondo (Alava). He is a doll dressed with a black suit and a tie. The Sunday of carnivals, he appears in the main street of the village riding a donkey and they take them to a castle. Here, they take him down from the donkey and they hang him from a six-meters stick for some hours. In the afternoon, a noisy procession appears. Here the preacher and the street cleaner come in the leading position. Then an old couple appears. These are the parents of Markitos, and a single person does the characters of both of them. And after them, other different characters. The last ones take Markitos down, and they put him in a cart. They drive this cart to a court wall and here the preacher judges Markitos. He says that he has to be killed, so people take the doll and they burn him. Kotilungorriak This character is typical from Uztaritz. The celebration lasts four days. The first three days, people dressed up as different characters, go home to home asking and there are also some parades during these three days. On these parades appears different characters like Kaskarot, Ponpiera and Kotilungorria. This last one is the most important one. Normally, there vare only two. They wear a red skirt over some white trousers. They wear also a white jacket and a typical apron. On their hands they wear a stick with a cow tail hanged. On their head, they wear a long pyramidal hut and their face is covered by a red clothing. This characters is usually scaring children. Atorrak They are a group of men and boys from Mundaka who go out to the street on the Sunday of Carnivals and they play music and they sing. They dressed white clothes, except the director of the band. Every year, they compose a new song and after going around all the village, they go to the harbor. This is the best part of their show. Joaldunak The Joaldunak are the protagonists from the Ituren and Zubieta carnivals in Navarre which are held on the Monday and Tuesday after the last Sunday in January. One of the notable characteristics of the Joaldunak is that they wear a pair of large cow bells tied tightly around their waist which they ring in a loud, rhythmic and atavistic dirge. They also wear a tall conical hat with coloured ribbons and a thick sheepskin over their shoulders. In their hands they hold a horse hair whip which they flick in front of them as they march.Carnavales de Navarra, Francisco Javier Tibero, 1993 pg 34 ‚Äì 38 On the Monday of carnivals, a troupe of Joaldunak from Zubieta, visit the village of Ituren where they are greeted by the locals who are dressed up as witches and demons. There is then a grand feast in Ituren village hall. On the Tuesday morning a troupe of Joaldunak from Ituren then march over to Zubieta where they are greeted by the villagers of Zubieta who are also dressed as demons and witches. Afterwards there is a large feast in Ituren village hall. The Joaldunak and the carnivals in Ituren and Zubieta have attracted much anthropological interest and some argue that they are the oldest pagan, pre-indoeuropean carnivals in Europe. Zalmantzain This is the protagonist of the dance of the Maskarada from Zuberoa, which lasts from the start of the carnivals and end on Tuesday. They celebrate it doing a show. In this shoe there are two different groups: the black ones and the red ones. The red ones are the characters that are elegantly and cleanly dressed (we can find Zalmantzain in this group). And the black ones are dressed as poor people. During the procession along the village, the black ones tried to annoy the red ones. When they arrive to the main square the red ones dance typical basque dances. Miel Otxin This is one of the principal characters of the carnivals on Monday and Tuesday in Lantz. With him, other ones appear like: Ziripot, Zaldiko and Txatxoa. Miel Otxin is a three-meter-tall doll made of straw. A Txatxo take him on his shoulders during the celebrations. Zaldiko is a centaur, a man dressed up as a horse. The Txatxos have different ways of dressing up. But they are always colorful and they wear a broom in their hands, their face covered and a colorful conical hut. The celebration starts on Monday. All this characters go out to the street. The Txatxos go around singing and dancing. Zaldiko tries to throw Ziripot and this one falls several times because he is a little bit clumsy. On Tuesday, the only character that goes out is Miel Otxin. The Txatxos carry him to the main square and here they judge him. They shoot him twice and they kill him. After that, they cut his body into pieces and they burn him.

It does not feature the band's original vocalist and guitarist, Goat, who left the band just after the reunion. Critical reception The album met with mixed to positive reviews. Sammy O'Hagar of MetalSucks gave the album a positive review and praised its raw sound and production. He also compared the album's sound to other notable second wave of black metal albums such as Transilvanian Hunger by Darkthrone and De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas by Mayhem. He also described the album's tempo as \\"mid-paced\\", in contrast to other black metal acts such as Satyricon, 1349 and Anaal Nathrakh. Venien's vocals were also likened to those of death metal, while the \\"rattling\\" guitar sound and noticeable basslines were noted. However, the reaction of Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media was mixed. He criticized the album's lack of progression and Venien's \\"bastardization\\" of Von's legacy although he also complimented on the album's low-fidelity production, high-energy and enthusiasm. Death metal, grindcore and hardcore punk elements in the album were also noted.

He belonged to the school of the Simonians, becoming its leader after the death of his master and instructor, Simon Magus, who was in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius. He is mentioned in the works of Irenaeus, Tertullian and others. Justin Martyr is the oldest source of knowledge about Menander after he met some of the devoted Menandrians in their old age. Biography Justin suggested that Menander was born in Cappareteia and established a school in Antioch where he announced himself the messiah and vowed to defeat the angels that were keeping the world in captivity, possibly through exorcism. When the Simonians divided during the Gnostic schism, Menander called his part of the sect Menandrians, holding the belief that the world was made by angels. His ideas contrasted with those of Saturninus of Antioch and the Satornilians, who believed the world was made by only seven angels against the will of a \\"Father on high\\". Menander held that a water baptism was essential as the source for eternal youth. Menander held solid to the belief that as head of the church, he was the savior and Power of God. Menander maintained that \\"the primary power continues unknown to all but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a savior, for the deliverance of men\\". Other magicians including Basilides and Cerdo became followers of Menander and were said to have \\"given immense development to his doctrines\\" with differing ethical consequences. It has been suggested that some of those who tried to interpret the doctrines of Menander, such as Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, took things far too literally. Irenaeus for instance, claimed that those in receipt of Menander's water baptism no longer grew old and became immortal.

Muhlenberg obituary from The Reading Eagle, December 12, 1960. His brother, Frederick Hunter Muhlenberg II (1865‚Äì1933), attended both Lafayette College and MIT. The founder's son, Charles Henry Muhlenberg V (1899‚Äì1985), attended the University of Wisconsin and MIT, and joined the firm in 1923. Frederick Hunter Muhlenberg II left the firm in the mid 1920s to go into partnership with his nephew, Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg II, operating as Muhlenberg & Muhlenberg. Muhlenberg Brothers designed both residential and commercial works, and large projects such as office buildings, churches and factories. Among the commissions were a vaudeville theater, a number of public school buildings, and much of the campus of Albright College. G. Russell Steininger, landscape architect, was a principal in the firm by 1929. Its main offices were located at 113-A South Fourth Street in Reading. It established a branch office in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and one in St. Petersburg, Florida in the 1920s.\\"Muhlenberg Bros. Registered Architects,\\" The Palm Beach Post, December 4, 1925, p.

The battle resulted in destruction of the castle, and retreat of the Croatian crew, that was forced to withdraw to safer territory of inland Croatia.  Historical background  Despite local skirmishes and battles along the Ottoman border with Croatia, Hungary and Transylvania at the beginning of the 1660s, there was a period of unstable and insecure (tacit assumption) temporary peace between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. It seemed that both sides wanted to keep it; however, Leopold I of Habsburg, twenty-year-old inexperienced Emperor, under strong influence of his advisors, feared Ottoman campaign towards Vienna and possible siege of the Austrian capital, so he kept the majority of his military forces close to Vienna. At the same time, Nikola Zrinski, a brave and skillful warrior, well-known all over Europe, demanded support from the Viennese court to consolidate and reinforce the border line in northern Croatia through new fortifications that would parry and neutralize the Ottoman threat from Kanije Eyalet in the occupied southwestern Hungary, but with no success. In 1661 Zrinski started to build a new stronghold, Novi Zrin Castle, on his own, at the confluence of the Mura River with the Drava, finishing it during 1662. Since then the castle was attacked several times by the Ottomans, especially in 1663, but the defence was solid and successful.  Siege  At the beginning of June 1664 a large Ottoman army, numbering up to 100,000 men (some sources mention even much more), including around 40,000 Ottoman and 30,000 Tatar fighters, led personally by the Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º, was moving from Constantinople to the northwest and approaching Novi Zrin (later to fight in the Battle of Saint Gotthard on 1 August 1664). The defenders of Novi Zrin consisted mostly of Croatian and German soldiers (around 3,000 men in total), while the majority of the Habsburg army (30,000 men), situated in the camp near Saint Gotthard, was waiting for the result of the battle. On 5 June 1664 K√∂pr√ºl√º ordered siege and continuous attacks upon the castle. After a few weeks of fighting, with exhausted defenders receiving only insignificant reinforcements from the Emperor's headquarters, the Turks managed to dig lagums, or tunnels, below the bastions and ignited gunpowder to blow them up. On 7 July 1664 the strong explosions destroyed some parts of the walls making big holes. Aggressors consequently rushed and penetrated into the castle. The surviving and enormously outnumbered Croatian defenders were forced to withdraw from the castle and to abandon the Mura River area. Ottoman commanders gave the order to their soldiers to ruin Novi Zrin completely to the ground and then moved further with the whole army to the north, first to Kanije and then towards Saint Gotthard.  Aftermath  The destruction of Novi Zrin, together with a little bit later (on 10 August 1664) signed unfavourable and shameful Peace of Vasv√°r, made Nikola Zrinski and other leading Croatian and Hungarian magnates angry and initiated the Zrinski‚ÄìFrankopan conspiracy. Later in the same year Zrinski died, allegedly killed by a wild boar, but the rest of magnates continued the conspiracy, which ended tragically in 1671. Novi Zrin was never rebuilt. Today there is only a memorial obelisk on the place where the castle once was.

It had been dissolved before World War I but was reformed for the war. It served with 7th Division on the Western Front before becoming XIV Army Brigade, RHA in February 1917. It was disbanded at the end of the war. History Formation Royal Horse Artillery brigades did not exist as an organizational or operational grouping of batteries until 1 July 1859 when the Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery was formed. The brigade system was extended to five (later six) brigades when the horse artillery of the Honourable East India Company had been transferred to the British Army in 1861. These brigades were reduced to five in 1871, then to three (of 10 batteries each) in 1877 and to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882. The brigade system was finally abolished in 1889. As battery designations were tied to the brigade that the battery was assigned to, batteries were redesignated in a bewildering sequence as they were transferred between brigades. For example, E Battery of C Brigade (E/C Bty) might become N Battery of A Brigade (N/A Bty) upon transfer. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation. The brigade system was revived in 1901. Each brigade now commanded just two batteries and a small staff (a Lieutenant- Colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major). Initially, batteries were not assigned to brigades in any particular order, but in 1906, at the insistence of Edward VII, brigades were redesignated so that batteries were roughly in order of seniority (hence I Brigade commanded A Battery and B Battery). XIV Brigade, RHA was formed on 1 March 1901 as the IV Brigade- Division, RHA with Z Battery and AA Battery. In 1903 it was redesignated as IV Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Woolwich. On 1 October 1906, it was redesignated as XIV Brigade, RHA and was dissolved on 1 August 1913. AA Battery had been disbanded on 1 May 1913 and Z battery was transferred to II Brigade, RHA at Canterbury. World War I =Reformed= XIV Brigade, RHA was reformed in September 1914 with C Battery (from II Brigade, RHA), F Battery (from IV Brigade, RHA) and XIV RHA Brigade Ammunition Column. It joined 7th Division at Lyndhurst on formation. With 7th Division, it crossed to Belgium on 4 and 5 October 1914 (landing at Zeebrugge on 6 October) and served with the division on the Western Front until February 1917. While with the division, it saw considerable action serving at the Siege of Antwerp, the First Battle of Ypres, and in the battles of Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, Festubert, Loos, and of the Somme. =Changes in organization= On 19 October 1914, C Battery left the brigade to join XV (later IV) Brigade, RHA in 3rd Cavalry Division. It was not replaced until 21 December 1914 when T Battery joined from The Force in Egypt. On 19 June 1915, F and T batteries replaced their 13-pounders with six 18-pounders each. 57th (H) Battery, RFA joined from XXXVII (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA on 27 November 1914. It returned to XXXVII (H) Brigade on 2 March 1915. D (H)/XIV Battery was formed on 17 May 1916 with one section of 31st (H) Battery and one section of 35th (H) Battery (both of XXXVII (H) Brigade, RFA). On 7 October 1916, 509th (H) Battery (four 4.5-inch howitzers) joined the brigade. On 13 February 1917 it was broken up to make up 31st (H) and 35th (H) batteries to six howitzers each. =Army brigade= On 10 February 1917, the brigade left 7th Division and became XIV Army Brigade, RHA. On 13 February, B Battery of CLXIX Brigade, RFA (B/CLXIX Battery) joined as C/XIV and one section of C(H)/CLXIX Battery, RFA made up D(H)/XIV Battery to six 4.5-inch howitzers. C/XIV Battery was later redesignated as 400th Battery and D(H)/XIV as 401st (H) Battery. The brigade moved to Italy in December 1917, before returning to the Western Front in March 1918. At the Armistice, it was serving as Army Troops with the Third Army with F Battery RHA, T Battery RHA, 400th Battery RFA and 401st (H) Battery RFA (eighteen 18-pounders and six 4.5-inch howitzers). The brigade was disbanded in Germany in May 1919. 400th and 401st (H) batteries were disbanded, F Battery joined III Brigade, RHA and T Battery joined IX Brigade, RHA, both in the United Kingdom.

It is named after the Tulpar, a winged horse in Turkic mythology. The vehicle has been designed to augment Turkey's new-generation Altay MBT in operations and to safely transport infantry to the front lines while providing fire support for other armored units. The IFV is also available in variants such as reconnaissance, command-and-control, personnel carrier, mortar, recovery, launch rocket system, air defence, ambulance and anti-tank vehicles. Background Even though the TSK has not formally posted an immediate requirement for a new infantry fighting vehicle, Otokar has started the development of Tulpar along with the Altay. Indeed, Tulpar was designed by the same team that developed Altay. After a 3-year design and development stage, Tulpar was finally unveiled to the public in 2013 at the IDEF international defense fair in Istanbul. Design Tulpar was designed for the dual role of providing fire support to friendly main battle tanks and safely transporting troops in a high-threat environment. Resistance against IEDs, small mines and high ballistic protection for its crew were among the high priority design criteria. Tulpar is also fully networkable with the Altay MBT and other units. In its basic form the Tulpar provides protection against small arms (STANAG 4569 level 2), but it can be upgraded with composite armor that provides protection against 25 mm projectiles (STANAG 4569 level 5). Tulpar features modular armor. This allows the maintenance center to quickly swap any damaged armor panels and also makes the IFV easily upgradable for added protection against higher caliber projectiles. Export customers of Tulpar can decide on what level of protection is desired based on their specific threat environment, terrain and IFV configuration. Otokar plans to install a hard kill system on the future variants of Tulpar. The vehicle is fully NBC protected. Mobility Tulpar is powered by an 810 hp, 15.7-liter, water-cooled V8 diesel engine that is turbo charged and drives a 32-speed automatic transmission. Suspension comes standard with a hydraulic damper and can carry up to 45 tons on the hull. Tulpar's maximum speed is 70 km/h and economic range is 600 km. Armament Otokar's Tulpar is fitted with the Mƒ±zrak-U turret system armed with a 30mm dual-fed automatic cannon and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. MIZRAK turret will be eqquiped Umtas anti tank missile. Situational Awareness Tulpar's crew enjoy full 360-degree day/night situational awareness thanks to an array of electro-optic sensors located on the Hull and Turret.  Variants   Tulpar IFV  Basic IFV model as described above.  Tulpar-S  First unveiled at IDEF 2015, the Tuplar-S is significantly lighter (15 tonnes), shorter and narrower than the Tulpar. It is a multi-purposed vehicle platform which retains basic features of standard Tulpar-IFV and has been designed to be both a light and an amphibious platform. Like the Tupar IFV, the Tulpar has been designed to be modular and can be configured for a variety of roles with a variety of weapons platforms. In the weapons-carrying, ATGM-armed RCT configuration, the Tulpar-S features a three-person crew (driver, commander, and gunner), with space for two dismounts. In its armoured-personnel-carrier version, the vehicle will also feature a three-person crew but with space for eight dismounts. Operators *: Turkish Armed Forces is expected to initially order up to 400 vehicles to augment the first batch of 250 Altay main battle tanks pending the evaluation trials of the IFV.

In its simplest form, a hyperlapse is achieved by moving the camera a short distance between each shot. The first film using the hyperlapse technique dates to 1995.  Technique  Regular time-lapse involves taking photos at a regular interval with a camera mounted on a tripod or using a motorized dolly and/or pan-and- tilt head to add limited motion to the shot. Hyperlapse relies on the time- lapse principle, but adds movement over much longer distances. This technique allows to use long exposures to create motion blur. The resulting image sequence is stabilized in post-production. The camera can also be mounted on a hand-held gimbal to achieve smooth motion while walking. A \\"Walking Hyperlapse\\", is a special hyperlapse technique that requires a person in the frame to walk at a specified interval. When played back, the person will appear to be walking at normal speed, while everything else appears to move quickly through the scene. For example, a hyperlapse recorded at 1 frame per second while a person is walking at 124 beats per minute, will capture a frame on every other step. When the hyperlapse is played back at 24 frames per second, the person will appear to be walking at normal speeds.  History  The first film using the hyperlapse technique seems to have been Pacer, shot on Super 8 film in Montreal in 1995 by Guy Roland, after experiments during the 1980s and 1990s. It has been suggested that the term \\"hyper-lapse\\" itself was first used in 2011 by American filmmaker Dan Eckert, and sustainably coined by Shahab Gabriel Behzumi¬¥s Berlin Hyperlapse in 2012. Films made from images derived from Google Street View and Google Maps have also been called hyperlapse videos. Software that can help produce hyperlapse-style videos include Hyperlapse from Instagram and a similarly named program from Microsoft. Unmanned aerial vehicles have been used to create aerial hyperlapses since at least 2015. Subgenres of hyperlapse are flowmotion and hyperzoom. Flowmotion was developed in the 2010s by British filmmaker Rob Whitworth. It combines hyperlapse, timelapse and regular film shots to create the suggestion of a story proceeding in one long, almost uninterrupted take. Hyperzoom was developed by Geoff Tompkinson and uses film and post-production techniques to create a seamless flight through diverse locations.

It premiered in its new Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot. This season consisted of 22 episodes. It stars Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir and Retta. The show moved to Thursdays at 8:30 pm beginning with its 100th episode. Much like the other seasons, Season 6 follows Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and her co- workers in local government of fictional Indiana town, Pawnee. The season chronicles Leslie facing the recall vote from City Council, Ann Perkins's (Rashida Jones) and Chris Traeger's (Rob Lowe) move to Michigan to start their family, Andy Dwyer's (Chris Pratt) career in London, and the city merger of Eagleton and Pawnee, resulting in the Unity Concert organized by Leslie. Cast Main * Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, the councilwoman for the town of Pawnee who loves her home town. She has not let politics dampen her optimism; her ultimate goal is to become President of the United States. Poehler departed from the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, where she was a cast member for nearly seven years, to star in Parks and Recreation. It was only after she was cast that Daniels and Schur established the general concept of the show and the script for the pilot was written. * Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse and political outsider who gradually becomes more involved in Pawnee government through her friendship with Leslie. Jones was among the first to be cast by Daniels and Schur in 2008, when the series was still being considered as a spin-off to The Office, where Jones had played Jim Halpert's girlfriend Karen Filippelli. * Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, Leslie's sarcastic and underachieving subordinate, who eventually begins to consider leaving his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests. As with Jones, Daniels and Schur had intended to cast Ansari from the earliest stages of the development of Parks and Recreation. * Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, the deadpan parks and recreation director who, as a libertarian, believes in as small a government as possible. As such, Ron strives to make his department as ineffective as possible, and favors hiring employees who do not care about their jobs or are poor at them. Nevertheless, Ron consistently demonstrates that he secretly cares deeply about his fellow co-workers. * Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate, a cynical and uninterested parks department intern who eventually becomes the perfect assistant for Ron. The role was written specifically for Plaza; after meeting her, casting director Allison Jones told Schur, \\"I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show.\\" * Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer, a goofy and dim-witted but lovable slacker. Pratt was originally intended to be a guest star and the character Andy was initially meant to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make him a regular cast member starting with season two. * Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt, Leslie's husband, a competent but socially awkward government official trying to redeem his past as a failed mayor in his youth. Scott left his starring role on the Starz comedy series Party Down to join the show. * Rob Lowe as Chris Traeger, an excessively positive and extremely health-conscious government official. Unlike Scott, Lowe was originally expected to depart after a string of guest appearances, but later signed a multi-year contract to become a regular cast member. * Jim O'Heir as Jerry Gergich, a sweet-natured but painfully incompetent longtime city employee who is the main target of the office petty unkindness, yet enjoys his life as the husband of a gorgeous woman and the father of three beautiful daughters. He reached retirement with a full pension in season 5, but returned to the Parks office to work as an intern. As of season six, the other characters have taken to calling him \\"Larry Gengurch,\\" after accidentally calling himself that name. * Retta as Donna Meagle, the confident and competent office manager for the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department. She is now accepting of her coworkers, previously dismissing them as boring. She has little tolerance for stupidity, can sometimes be selfish, enjoys casual dating, and is irresistible to many men. Donna loves her car, a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV. Recurring * John Balma as Barney Varmn, an accountant. He regularly attempts to hire Ben as an employee. * Alison Becker as Shauna Malwae-Tweep, a newspaper journalist working for The Pawnee Journal. * Kristen Bell as Ingrid de Forest, an elitist city councilwoman from Eagleton. * Lucy Lawless as Diane Lewis, a middle school vice-principal and Ron's wife. * Richard Burch as Herman Lerpiss, the owner of the Pawnee Pawn Shop. * Andrew Burlinson as Wyatt \\"Burly\\" Burlison, the lead guitarist of Andy's band \\"Mouse Rat\\". * Mo Collins as Joan Callamezzo, a tabloid journalist and hostess of the local news/talk show Pawnee Today. * Billy Eichner as Craig Middlebrooks, the former office manager of Eagleton's parks department.

Due to the departure of Jones and Lowe, longtime regulars Jim O'Heir and Retta were added to the show's opening credit sequence starting with episode 14, \\"Anniversaries\\". Jones appears as a special guest star in episode 17 when Ann has her baby. Chris Pratt was absent for much of the early part of the season, due to him filming Guardians of the Galaxy in London. Executive producer Michael Schur stated the show went to London for the first two episodes in order for Pratt's character Andy to make an appearance. Pratt made a brief return in the sixth episode, with Schur adding that Pratt would return to the series in the tenth episode, the series' 100th episode. In February 2014, NBC announced a digital tie-in for the show, titled \\"The Hapley Group\\", which aired on February 20. Created \\"to help viewers remain engaged with their favorite programs\\" while NBC broadcasts the 2014 Winter Olympics, it featured Jay Jackson, Matt Besser, Nick Kroll and Mo Collins reprising their roles as Perd Hapley, Crazy Ira, The Douche, and Joan Callamezzo, respectively, with Seth Morris as Mike Patterson, a new character who recurred on the TV show as well. The tie-in, directed by Morgan Sackett and written by Greg Levine, features the characters in a heated, political round-table discussion of Pawnee's hot topics. Retta tweeted on February 27, 2014 that filming for the season had finished. Episodes denotes an extended episode. denotes an hour-long episode.

G. Bagnall, Hunslet, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Vulcan Foundry for the Drewry Car Co. They were built between 1953 and 1967.  Introduction  Following on from the success of the initial batch of DS class 0-6-0DM shunting locomotives, NZR management decided to acquire further locomotives of this type. These locomotives would be similar to the DS class and would be allocated to the major centres where they would be used primarily as shunting locomotives. As they would be slightly heavier these locomotives were allocated the DSA classification. The first batch of seven DSA class locomotives arrived in 1953 from the Drewry Car Company, with another fourteen coming from that maker the following year. NZR also placed orders in 1954 with W. G. Bagnall and Hunslet for a further ten and fifteen locomotives respectively, which were delivered in 1956-57 by Bagnall and 1954-58 by Hunslet. No further DSAs were purchased until NZR placed an order with Mitsubishi Heavy Engineering for a further ten locomotives in 1967, all of which were delivered later that year. Drewry Car Company ; Road numbers DSA 216-235 (TMS DSA 209-401) ; Maker's Nos. 2414/D163-2433/D182 Designated as model A-2, these locomotives were built by the Vulcan Foundry of English Electric for the Drewry Car Company. They weighed 29.5 tons ready for service and were powered by a Gardner 8L3 diesel engine producing 204 hp. The driving wheels were 39¬æ\\", the same size as that of the DS class. All entered service between November 1953 and June 1954 and were based mostly in the North Island. Two locomotives, DSA's 218 and 234, were reallocated to the South Island and were noted in January 1977 as being based at Invercargill. Visually, the Drewry DSA was very similar to the earlier DS class, although the upper half of the cab tapered inwards as opposed to the straight-sided cab of the DS. Most retained their original red livery to the end of their service with NZR although two, DSA265 (pre-TMS DSA 221) and DSA401 (pre-TMS DSA 235) did receive the International Orange livery at NZR Otahuhu Workshops in 1982 and 1983 respectively. W. G. Bagnall ; Road numbers DSA 240-249 (TMS DSA 414-510) ; Maker's Nos. 3079-3088 These ten locomotives were standard Bagnall 0-6-0DM shunting locomotives, similar to those supplied to Tasman Pulp and Paper in 1954 (one locomotive) and Wilsons Portland Cement in 1958 (two locomotives). They weighed ready for service, and were originally powered by a National M4AA6 diesel engine producing connected to a Vulcan-Sinclair fluid coupling and Wilson five-speed epicyclic gearbox. They had wheels and a top speed of as built, later reduced to after re- powering. All were exclusively based in the North Island, and in 1977 it was noted that DSA's 240-247 were based in Wellington while DSA's 248 and 249 were based at Palmerston North. Later, several migrated to Gisborne where they finished their NZR service. Due to issues with the M4AA6 engine, NZR decided to refit the locomotives in 1968 with more reliable Caterpillar D343T diesel engines and Twin Disc torque converters. This resulted in the cosmetic appearance of the locomotive changing with a new housing mounted on the left- hand side running board to protect the torque converter while several hood panels were fitted with large mesh sections to improve cross-ventilation. Most of the locomotives were eventually repainted into the International Orange livery. One notable variant of this was DSA 470 (pre-TMS DSA 245) after it was involved in an accident which destroyed the original hood-front. A new one was fabricated from sheet metal, giving 470 a more austere look with its flat- faced hood. This locomotive spent its last years working out of Gisborne and was withdrawn in April 1990. Hunslet Engine Company ; Road numbers DSA 250-264 (TMS DSA 523-510) ; Maker's NOs. 4528-4537, 4697-4701 These fifteen locomotives were standard Hunslet 0-6-0DM diesel shunting locomotives, similar to the British Rail Class 2/8 and 2/9 class shunting locomotives. They weighed ready for service and had wheels. The initial batch of ten locomotives were fitted with National M4AA6 diesel engines developing a slightly higher 250 hp powering a Hunslet friction clutch and four-speed gearbox but this gave trouble and the last batch were fitted with hydraulic transmissions, again powered by the 250 hp M4AA6. All of the Hunslet locomotives were based exclusively in the South Island and came in three batches - the first in 1954-55 (DSA's 250-254, 257), the second in 1956 (DSA's 255, 258) and the third and final batch in 1957-58 (DSA's 256, 257, 259-264). At an early stage five were repowered with 204 hp Gardner 8L3 diesel engines but all were eventually repowered with 315 hp Caterpillar D343T engines. Mitsubishi Heavy Engineering ; Road numbers DSA 265-276 (TMS DSA 699-822) ; Maker's NO's. 1460-1471 These eleven locomotives were the last DSA class locomotives to enter service and the most modern. They weighed 38.1 tons ready for service and had 39¬æ\\" wheels. All were fitted with 315 hp Caterpillar D343T diesel engines with Twin Disc torque converters. All were exclusively confined to the South Island pre-1991. The class was regularly allocated to Timaru and at least three locomotives of this type were allocated there in the 1980s. Withdrawal and preservation With the rationalisation of New Zealand Railways Corporation in the 1980s, the need for the DSA class was reduced, with the first locomotives of this class being withdrawn early in this decade. The entire class was withdrawn by 1990 with the exception of two locomotives; Hunslet DSA551 (DSA 253) which was owned by New Zealand Railways but used as the shunting locomotive for the Kingston Flyer at Kingston, and Mitsubishi DSA782 (DSA 273) which had been overhauled and moved to Poverty Bay for use at Wairoa as a shunting locomotive. Due to the number of DSA class locomotives and their higher power rating, these locomotives were purchased in large numbers by industrial users. A smaller number of locomotives were purchased directly from New Zealand Railways as they were withdrawn. Return to service In the 1990s, New Zealand Rail Limited and its successor Tranz Rail took two DSA class locomotives back into their stock list - Hunslet DSA551 (DSA 253) and Mitsubishi DSA782 (DSA 273). In 1991, DSA782 was returned from loan to Rail Base Systems after the conclusion of track recovery beyond Middlemarch on the Otago Central Railway. Although obsolete, the DSA was overhauled and dispatched to Wairoa on the Palmerston North-Gisborne Line for use as a shunting locomotive in 1995. It retained its \\"International Orange\\" livery but with Frutiger-script numbers on the cab. The locomotive was later on-sold to the Northland Dairy Company and used to shunt their plant at Kauri. In 1999, former Kingston Flyer shunting locomotive DSA551 was replaced by a TR class locomotive. The DSA was then trucked to Dunedin and overhauled at Hillside Workshops, during which time it was repainted in a variant of the Tranz Rail \\"Cato Blue\\" livery. It was returned to service in 2001, before moving to Awatoto in 2003 to replace Mainline Steam-owned DSA 258 (DSA617) at Ravensdown Fertiliser Awatoto. The locomotive was later sold to Ravensdown for use as their plant shunter.

History The lighthouse in its compound. The lighthouse is built of local stone and was completed in 1881. It was opened by Joseph Chamberlain, the President of the Board of Trade. The lighthouse tower is twelve metres tall, the height of the light above the high-water mark is . The light is positioned to give a waypoint for vessels passing along the English Channel coast. Originally the light was illuminated by a Douglass multi-wick mineral oil burner, set within a large (first order) revolving 14-panel dioptric optic by Chance Brothers & Co. It was the first example of a significant new design of lighthouse optic, whereby (through the use of dense flint glass in the upper and lower portions) the height of a Fresnel lens could be significantly increased, dispensing with the need for additional reflective prisms above and below; the lenses alone stood high. The lamp was also specially designed for Anvil Point by James Douglass; it was subsequently used in other large coastal lighthouses, a series of international patents having been granted.US Patent grant 1883. An explosive fog signal was established at the lighthouse in February 1894, which in foggy weather sounded once every ten minutesLondon Gazette, Issue 26487, Page 1091, 20 February 1894 (later altered to every five minutes). In the early 20th century a paraffin vapour burner (PVB) replaced the oil lamp. During 1960, the lighthouse was modernised and electrified (with a new lamp, powered by mains electricity, replacing the PVB). At the same time a smaller optic replaced the original lens array, which was removed and donated to the Science Museum. That same year, the five-minute explosive fog signal was replaced by a triple-frequency electric signal, sounded from a stack of thirty tannoy emitters positioned on the seaward edge of the compound directly in front of the lighthouse. In 1981 new automatic equipment was installed, but the fog signal was discontinued in 1988. Anvil Point Lighthouse was fully automated on 31 May 1991 and is now monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at Harwich. The lighthouse had a 1,000 watt filament lamp with an intensity of 500,000 Candela. The lights range was about , but was reduced to following a review of aids to navigation in 2010. In 2012, a LED lamp was installed above the rotating Fresnel lens to serve as the main light at Anvil Point; its character is, as it was previously, a white flash every 10 seconds. (The old lens, though no longer in use, remains in place in the tower.) The lighthouse is near a visitor centre and is sometimes open to the public for tours. This area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Some of the old buildings have been refurbished as holiday cottages.

It is an original story written by Argentinian , whose work has included Amor en Custodia, Patito Feo, Braveheart, and Aurora, among others. It follows the adventures of the young vampire Daisy O'Brian, played by Greeicy Rend√≥n. Throughout Latin America, the series is broadcast by Nickelodeon Latin America. According to KidScreen Magazine, as of February 2014, Chica Vampiro was the most viewed program among children and teens between the ages of 4 and 17 in Colombia. In September 2019, RCN Televisi√≥n announced that Chica Vampiro would be available on Netflix.  Premise  The series follows the life of Daisy O'Brian (Greeicy Rend√≥n), an otherwise ordinary teenaged girl born into a family of vampires, who maintain a family tradition of offering the vampire curse to its members on their 16th birthday: Daisy, who had long made up her mind to remain mortal, is hit by a truck on that very day. When doctors inform her family that Daisy will die of her injuries, her parents Ana (Jacqueline Arenal) and Ulises (Juan Pablo Obreg√≥n) decide to bite her, turning her into a vampire and saving her life. With vampirism thrust upon her against her will, Daisy is forced to hide her true nature from mortals and learn to live between two worlds: the mortal realm, where she attends school and attempts to pursue her dream of being a singer, and the Vampire World (Mundo Vampiro in the series), where she must attend vampire school, to learn how to deal with her new condition. Daisy must also deal with her feelings for her neighbor Max de la Torre (Santiago Talledo), for whom she intended to remain mortal, and with the feelings of vampire Mirco Vladimoff (Eduardo P√©rez), who believes Daisy is his prophesized true love. Throughout the series, the O'Brian family also faces conflict from other sources, such as mortals attempting to unmask them and feuds with other vampire families.

Robert Henryson, author of The Morall Fabillis, was associated with the place. The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman is a poem by the 15th-century Scottish poet Robert Henryson and part of his collection of moral fables known as the Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian. It is written in Middle Scots. As with the other tales in the collection, appended to it is a moralitas which elaborates on the moral that the fable is supposed to contain. However, the appropriateness of the moralitas for the tale itself has been questioned. The tale combines two motifs. Firstly, a husbandman tilling the fields with his new oxen makes a rash oath aloud to give them to the wolf; when the wolf overhears this, he attempts to make sure that the man fulfills his promise. The fox mediates a solution by speaking to them individually; eventually he fools the wolf into following him to claim his supposed reward for dropping the case, and tricks him into a draw-well. The moralitas connects the wolf to the wicked man, the fox to the devil, and the husbandman to the godly man. A probable source for the tale is Petrus Alfonsi's Disciplina Clericalis, containing the same motifs, and William Caxton's Aesop's Fables‚Äîthough the tale is a beast fable, not Aesopic. Sources William Caxton (pictured centre-right), whose translation of Aesop's Fables was a probable source for the tale A probable source of the tale is Petrus Alfonsi's Disciplina clericalis, which has the same three motifs: the rash promise of the husbandman; the wolf mistaking the moon for cheese; and the wolf that descends into the well via a bucket, thereby trapping himself and freeing the fox.Farber 2000, p. 89. However, the discussion of legality and the questioning of language that take place alongside these motifs are entirely Henryson's invention. Whereas the moral of Alfonsi's tale explains that the wolf lost both the oxen and the cheese because he \\"relinquished what was present for what was to come\\" (Latin: pro futuro quod presens erat dimisit), Henryson's moralitas more fully involves the husbandman.Farber 2000, p. 90. Another source may be Aesop's Fables as published by William Caxton‚Äîscholar John MacQueen considers this more likely than Disciplina clericalis‚Äîalthough the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre.MacQueen 2006, p. 175. The plots of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making a victim of the wolf.MacQueen 2006, p. 176. Synopsis Tale A husbandman tilling the fields with his new, untrained oxen is made furious by their wrecking of the land. In his anger he makes the rash oath that the wolf \\"mot have you all at anis! [may, at once]\\". However, the wolf is lying nearby with the fox, and, overhearing it, promises to make him stay true to his word. Eventually the oxen calm down, but on the way back home the wolf jumps into their path. The wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them, since they are not his, to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before. The wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration, to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything. They argue, and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness; in response, he produces the fox. The creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute, and takes each aside in turn. To the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him were it not for the \\"grit coist and expence\\" of doing so; the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has, to which the fox acedes and goes off. To the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case. The wolf, after some complaint, agrees to this and the two proceed through the woods after the prize‚Äîall the while the fox considers how to trick the wolf. Eventually, as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest, they arrive at a draw-well with buckets on each end of a rope. Seeing the reflection of the moon in the water at the bottom of the well, the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up. When he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone, the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help. However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox has jumped, and so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end. Moralitas The wolf is likened to a wicked man who oppresses others. The fox is likened to the devil. The farmer is likened to the godly man, with whom the fiend finds fault. The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get. The cheese represents covetousness; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy, which draws men downwards into hell. Analysis As with other tales in the collection, the moralitas of The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman can be considered at odds with the tale itself. Lianne Farber highlights a number of these discrepancies, and says that the allegory \\"does not hold true in any traditional sense\\". Amongst the inconsistencies is that the fox, not the wolf, is the figure that argues with and finds fault in the husbandman; the \\"woods of the world\\" are not traversed by the husbandman, in spite of the moralitas suggesting it is applicable to all men; Farber argues that even assuming the moral to be true is problematic, since it apparently suggests that the godly man must bribe the figure of the judge, and that this does not affect his godly status. Furthermore, the absence of the legal discussion and the binding quality of words from the moralitas suggests to Farber that the \\"intricate legal framework ‚Ä¶ has no impact whatsoever in resolving the issues with which it is supposed to deal\\". In contrast, Philippa M. Bright considers that the moralitas of this tale, as well as several others, create \\"an additional sense which co-exists with the literal narrative and extends and complements it thematically\\"; treating literal details symbolically and establishing the sense through direct comparisons.Bright 1990, pp. 150‚Äì51. According to Dorothy Yamamoto, the significant themes in the tale are \\"solidity and vacancy, substance and illusion\\".Yamamoto 2000, p. 70. The cheese that apparently resides in the well is only an illusion, not a solid object, and similarly the fox creates a surface reconciliation between the wolf and the husbandman, but which betrays his real intentions.MacQueen 2006, p. 176. Through their frequent misuse, words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning. As an example, Yamamoto highlights the fox's taill on which the wolf and husbandman make their pledge‚Äîwhich body part she says is used by the fox in other tales to blind his foes, and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use.

He is also a professor at the University of Cape Town in the School of Dance.  Childhood  Maxwell's grandparents raised him. His family is from a village in the Eastern Cape called Cofimvaba and migrated in the 60s to settle in Cape Town for \\"greener pastures.\\" Maxwell was born and raised in Nyanga Township in Cape Town. He attended the Zolani Centre in Nyanga where he became a full-time boy scout of the fourth Den.  Early involvement in dance  While he was attending the boy scouts, he was also attending Zulu dance training and dancing in Zolani Centre in Nyanga. Eventually he gave up boy scouts and focused on dancing. His aunt worked for a ballet dance couple and they were familiar with Maxwell because he was with them at weekends. One of them, Professor David Pool, who was the head of department of UCT School of Dance, was the Director of Cape Town City Ballet for a long time. He showed interest in dancing Maxwell was involved with in the Township. David ended up coming to the Township to join in and got introduced to other dance forms. Maxwell learned about choreography, contemporary and ballet. A lot knowledge was acquired as far as dance discipline is concerned.  Later schooling  Maxwell attended high school in Nyanga Township at a school called Oscar Mpetha which was called Sizamile then. He then went to a private School which was a French school, where all subjects were in French. He attended college overseas in times of apartheid, including the Paris Institute and Greenwich in London, but ultimately ended up at University of Cape Town. He also freelanced as an established artist overseas.  Dance career  Maxwell's dance career started from Nyanga when David Poole was working with them, because at that time he had started performing professionally in theaters and other productions. It rose high when he went overseas to France, Canada and London. He was trained by many acclaimed teachers and dancers from Germaine Acogny to H. Patten in London. His experience in performing overseas taught him different styles and influences that made him an established South African Artist overseas and at home in South Africa. He started teaching dance overseas as an extramural thing as he was a full-time student and dancer. But his right knee made him to think hard about teaching as he was not consistent in terms of physio. During that time he was still in London. He taught African dance overseas in Brazil, Beijing, Senegal, Jamaica, and the USA (Philadelphia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina). One day he received a letter requesting to be a ‚Äúguinea pig‚Äù at the University of Cape Town School of Dance. He was to be the first African dance major student with a full scholarship. After giving a thought about the offer, he then accepted it because he wanted to return home and be a formal and accredited dance teacher with a qualification. He attended four years and then was planning on returning overseas when the head of the department, Professor Elizabeth Triegaardt, proposed that he stay and build the course to another level and stretch it a little bit by using his contacts and dance experience. It took a lot of negotiations to stay as he was dying to return to his familiar lifestyle because he realised lots of things such as ‚Äúhow far backwards his country was in the performance industry‚Äù. Though, at the time, South Africa's dance industry was not relatively active, he considers the country to be of much progress in recent times.

Downey Road, East Los Angeles, California USA Postal Code: 90023. History The Mount Zion Cemetery (opened 1916) property was owned by The Masonic Cemetery Association. It was used by the Jewish Free Burial Society (◊ó◊ë◊®◊™ ◊ß◊ì◊ô◊©◊ê ◊î◊ó◊ï◊§◊©◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊™ Chevra Chesid Shel Emeth) when opened. It is not clear that Chevra Chesid, the name translating Free Burial Society, was ever a charitable organization. The history of Charles Groman, at Hillside Cemetery where he is buried, states as follows: \\"Charles Groman (1883 ‚Äì 1932) In 1929, Charles Groman joined Louis Glasband to form Glasband-Groman-Glasband, the first licensed Jewish mortuary west of Chicago. It succeeded Chevra Chesed Shel Emes, a mortuary established in 1912 by Louis Glasband, Harry Lyons and H. S. Wapner.\\" The burial society (run by Groman and Glasband) seemed to be less a charitable organization but rather a society that offered Jewish burial services. The Masonic Cemetery Association was a for-profit corporation incorporated in 1904 managed by Masonic Lodge #42. There were many Jews of prominence in the lodge most affiliated with B'nai B'rith Temple (aka later Wilshire Blvd. Temple) including Rabbi Wolfe Edleman five time Grand Master. It would seem that the cemetery was initially used as a segregated burial ground for Jewish immigrants of Eastern European descent. Looking at the dates on the expensive headstones leads one to believe that after 1920 there were few free burials. The ongoing research by The Friends of Mount Zion Cemetery now calls into question the number of earliest burials that were charitable. The Jewish Free Burial Society, Chevra Chesid, faded away in 1929, with the partnership of Glasband-Groman-Glasband. The cemetery property's owner, today, is The Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles as successor in interest to the Masonic Cemetery Association. The Federation pays the annual property tax and pays Home of Peace Cemetery $12k per year to maintain the property. Mount Zion was basically a vandalized mess until 2013 when a group of local citizens raised funds to secure the property and perform the most minimal of restoration to destroyed grave beds and pillows.Los Angeles Times March 28, 2013 Its affluent neighbor, Home of Peace (originally owned by B'nai B'rith), boasts expanses of trimmed grass, handsome columns and statuary.

Completed on April 15, 1897, the well was drilled in the Bartlesville Sand near Bartlesville, opening an era of oil exploration and development in Oklahoma. It was abandoned as a well in 1964. The site was donated to the city of Bartlesville and is now a park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, featuring a restored drilling rig. Background The well was backed by George B. Keeler and William Johnstone, Keeler had been adopted into the Osage Nation and Johnstone had been adopted into the Delaware Nation after marrying Native American women. Keeler and Johnstone left Bartles to open their own store near the Osage Indian Agency on the Caney River, and was named for Johnstone's daughter. Keeler and Johnstone, together with partner Frank Overlees and their Native American wives, leased from the Cherokee Nation on an area of oil seep and engaged the Cudahy Oil Company to finance the actual drilling operation.\\"First Oklahoma Oil Well.\\" American Oil & Gas Historical Society. Accessed October 20, 2017. Organizing and drilling The firm of McBride and Bloom, headquartered in Independence, Kansas, had already been drilling in the Red Fork field. The original drilling rig had been used at a dry hole near Sapulpa. It took two weeks to move it by oxcart overland to the Bartlesville site. The well went to , and was completed using a then-usual technique of placing a \\"torpedo\\" (containing a liquid nitroglycerine charge) into the well to fracture the bore and release the oil. Keeler's stepdaughter, Jennie Cass, dropped the \\"go devil\\" charge, causing the explosive to detonate on impact, in front of fifty spectators. The ensuing gusher produced between 50 and 75 barrels a day, and had to be capped for two years until means could be found to move the oil to a more distant market. According to Kenny Franks' article in the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture, the Nellie Johnstone well had not been properly sealed before it was capped. Oil continued seeping into the sump while the well was blocked, eventually overflowing into the nearby Caney River. During the unusually cold winter that followed, a group of children ice skating on the frozen river, built a bonfire to keep themselves warm. Somehow the fire spread close to the oil seep, igniting it. The fire then spread to the Nellie Johnstone, causing major damage to the facility.Franks, Kenny A. \\"Petroleum Industry.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. Accessed October 20, 2017. The well was uncapped in 1900, after the Kansas, Oklahoma Central and Southwestern Railway, later acquired by Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, came to Bartlesville, stimulating the development of the Bartlesville field by offering to transport crude to market in Neodesha, Kansas. Nellie Johnstone Cannon, who was six years old at the time the well was drilled and named for her, was granted the land on which the well was drilled by allotment through her Native American ancestry. She sold the land to Bartlesville in 1917. The area is now Johnstone Park. Creation of Johnstone Park A replica drilling rig was built over the well in 1948, while the rig was still producing. After the Johnstone No. 1 well was abandoned in 1963, and interest in maintaining the site as a historical monument had begun to grow, the rig scene was reconstructed, using redwood timbers for the derrick. The derrick was rebuilt in 2008. The well site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

Valley RFC closeup-1988  Rugby  = Men's Rugby = Valley is the most successful Rugby Club in Hong Kong and has won trophies at all levels of competition over the past 12 years. In recent years, the Premiership team has won back to back championships and grand finals. From 2013-2018 the premiership team had a winning streak of 6 Grand Championships in a row. Along with 2 League victories over that time. 2015/16 and 2016/17. In 2009 Valley had an unbeaten season with wins in the league and Grand Championship! In the 2002/03 seasons Valley first team went undefeated for 16 consecutive matches taking out the League and then the Grand Championship. In the same season, the coach and captain were awarded by the HKRFU with the Coach of the Year and the Player of the Year respectively. The Top Try Scorer award also went to a Valley player, with a record 25 tries. A number of Valley players represent the Hong Kong National team In recent years two Valley players have moved on to play in the Super 12 tournament in the southern hemisphere and several have moved into the National First Divisions in European teams. One player from 1999 also went on to represent the New Zealand All Blacks. In the 2002/03 seasons, two ex-Super 12 players represented Valley at Club level, raising the levels of experience and talent throughout the club. Valley has a long-standing rivalry with the neighbour Hong Kong Football Club known as the Valley derby. Valley holds the record for most consecutive Grand Championship wins with six in a row as of March 2018 = Youth Rugby (Valley Fort RFC) = In 2002 Valley RFC re-established links with Stanley Fort so that it could build a better framework to cater for more youth sides and to help provide young rugby players with a seamless path from junior to senior rugby. In 2004, to enhance the affiliation with Valley RFC, Stanley Fort changed its name to Valley Fort RFC and now plays in black and red (following the senior team strip). Valley Fort is one of the larger mini-rugby clubs in Hong Kong and has over 600 registered players in its mini and colt sections. The club runs a number of teams at all age groups from Under 5's to Under 18s. = Ladies' Rugby = Valley Ladies (The Pink Ladies) was formed in 1996 as part of the development of women's rugby in Hong Kong. Ladies rugby in Hong Kong has evolved over the years from 7's rugby, 10-a-side rugby to the first season of 15's rugby being played in 2002‚Äì2003. At the time Valley couldn't field a women's 15's side, however they did continue in the ladies 7's league. They are supported by the same coaches and levels of expertise available to the men's section. Off the field and off-season they are as active with touch and tag rugby and Dragon Boating where this year The Pink Ladies Dragon Boating squad won the plate winners narrowly beating the Hockey section Avalon Maidens.  Hockey  Comprising five Men's teams and five Ladies' teams, the hockey section is the largest section within Valley RFC with over 200 active members  Netball  Valley RFC currently has 11 Netball teams competing throughout the 7 divisions of the Hong Kong Netball Association. Valley RFC Netball is one of the most successful and decorated netball clubs in Hong Kong bringing home over 20 league trophies in the Senior Women's Competition. Because of our history and success, Valley Netball continues to be the most coveted club attracting over 150 players to our Women's League annual August trials. Valley Netball has recently recruited Joline Henry, former Silver Fern as player and coach.

It was built in 1902‚Äì5 and is a replica of the Lourdes Grotto in France. The context of building this grotto is the vision of the Madonna that a young girl, Bernadette Soubirous, experienced 18 times. Prior to that the Pope had promulgated the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854. Pope Francis, a day after his appointment as the new Roman Pontiff, visited the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes on the afternoon of 15 March 2013 and offered prayers before the statue of the Virgin Mary. Background The historical context of creating a grotto in the Vatican Gardens is that on 8 December 1854 the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed by Pope Pius IX at a column of the Piazza di Spagna adorned with a statue of the Madonna or Virgin Mary. The context of the dogma was further accentuated by the visionary message given by the Madonna to Bernadette Soubirous, a young girl of 14, that \\"She\\" was the \\"Immaculate Conception\\" and that a shrine should be established for her at Massabielle near Lourdes. This visionary message had appeared to Soubirous 18 times. Pope Leo XIII called for a copy of the Grotto of Lourdes to be built and blessed in the Vatican Gardens where the clergy reside, meet and hold liturgical celebrations. On 1 June 1902, the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes, Fran√ßois-Xavier Schoepfer, presented the Grotto di Lourdes to Pope Leo XIII in the penultimate year of his pontificate. The reproduction in the Vatican Gardens was made by Constantine Sneider of the Apostolic Palaces. The medallion inscribed at the entrance to the grotto, made by Sneider, shows the images of both popes. Building of the Grotto was facilitated by the Missionaries of the Immaculate Conception throughout the Catholic world. The inaugural function was attended by cardinals, bishops and a large audience when Bishop Schoepfer recorded the universal value of the gift. A formal consecration was held on 28 March 1905 by Pius X when his successor Pius XI was also present. Features The Grotta di Lourdes in the Vatican is smaller than the French original but is on an appropriate scale. Even the surroundings of the church have been replicated. The spire of the Grotto which was fairly tall, was accessed by two flights of stairs, one on each side. However, the spire was ordered to be demolished by Pius XI for reasons of safety. In 1962, the two side stairways up to the spire were also demolished on orders from Pope John XXIII. With this change, the Grotto became a simple structure with an evocative altar and a small statue of the Immaculate. Below this statue there is an inscription of Mary's message to young Bernadette Soubirous (who was beatified in 1925 and canonized in 1933) of the Immaculate Conception. The square front courtyard of the Grotto was the venue, during the 1930s, for a papal guard of honour on the occasion of the oath-taking ceremony of new recruits joining the papal service. The original altar of the Lourdes Grotto in France was gifted by the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes Pierre-Marie Th√©as to Pope John XXIII in 1960 and was installed in the Grotta di Lourdes. Another annual event held every year on 31 May, during the conclusion of the procession, is the visit of the Pope to the Grotto in order to conduct mass. Pope John Paul II visited the Grotta on 31 May 2000, after which he addressed the assembled. Pope Benedict XVI visited the Grotta on 31 May 2011; he used to walk to the Vatican Gardens, visit the Grotto and offer prayers before the image of the Immaculate Conception. The structure is situated along the wall to the Torre San Giovanni. Next to the Grotto there is fountain dedicated to the invitation given by Our Lady to Bernadette and also a marble plaque which gives a history in Latin of the building of the Grotto until it was modified under the directives of John XXIII.

The Pacatnamu (Mochica : Pakatnam√∫, Spanish : Pacatnam√∫) site is located at the mouth of the Jequetepeque Valley on the northern coast of Peru. Rocky cliffs protect two of its sides and a manmade wall protects the third. This area of Peru does not have a tropical environment; it gets very little precipitation and has a mild climate, which sometime can become very humid.  Excavation history  Pacatnamu landscape. Explorers had mentioned the site of Pacatnamu since the late 1800s, but the site was not studied in detail until 1925. Kroeber made some sketches of the main architectural features of the site but only of one portion of the site. Archaeological excavations first began in 1937‚Äì39 by German archaeologist, Ubbelohde-Doering. He conducted more excavations in 1952‚Äì53 and again in 1962‚Äì63. His work resulted in more excavations of more pyramid complexes. Wolfgang and Giesela Hecker joined Ubbelohde-Doering on his 1962‚Äì63 excavations. They produced a general map of the site as a whole as well as some detailed maps of the architectural features. Richard Keatinge conducted an extensive surface survey in 1974 and published several brief reports on his findings. In 1983 the Instituto Nacional de Cultura in Lima approved the Museum of Cultural History at the University of California, Los Angeles request to do a five-year excavation permit at Pacatanamu. This excavation was extremely successful and from their research they produced hundreds of artifacts and created a chronology of occupation for the site.  Chronology  There are two periods of occupation-an early period when Moche ceramics were in use, and a later period characterized by the use of Chimu ceramics. Brick serration used in construction allows us to see a chronology of occupation within each of those times of occupation. Pacatnamu was unoccupied before the end of Moche IV or the beginning of the Moche V (ca. A.D. 600). During this Moche period some ceremonial architecture was constructed. During this time of occupation ceramics clearly show some Huari influence, but the textiles are clearly Moche. Also the burials from this time simply reflect Moche styles. Near the end of Moche occupation (ca. A.D. 900) a new ceramic for was added and this has clearly signaled the end of the Moche occupation. In approximately A.D. 1050 there is a break between the Moche occupation and Chimu occupation. This period coincides with extensive flooding in this area and a dramatic change in nearly all artifact types. Around A.D. 1100‚Äì1150 there was another large population living in Pacatnamu with a new style of ceramics, textiles and bricks, and new architectural forms that help us date the sites occupational periods. The second outbreak of population is known as the Chimu occupation. Major walls were built at this time because of a need for defense. There is a bit of unfinished wall to the north, which suggests they were trying to expand near the end of their occupation. Not much is known about why the Chimu occupation ended but it happened sometime around A.D. 1370. It is possible that more populations occupied Pacatnamu after 1370, but by the time the Inca conquered the North Coast the site was mostly in ruins.  Agriculture and economy   Agriculture  There are two periods of occupation-an early period when Moche ceramics were in use, and a later period characterized by the use of Chimu ceramics.

It is possible that more populations occupied Pacatnamu after 1370, but by the time the Inca conquered the North Coast the site was mostly in ruins.  Evidence of animal use  Llama proved to be an important animal at Pacatnamu both for everyday use and ritualistic purposes. Their bones are found in many burials throughout the site. The black vulture was also an important animal of religious life at Pacatnamu; its bones are often found with mass burials associated with ritualistic killings.  Trade  The site was one used for a pilgrimage site. There are good present from all over the nearby valley and spanning from many different occupational cultures, but there is no evidence of trade and there is repeated spiritual architecture and evidence of those buildings being used for much longer than other administrative buildings at the site. Otherwise there is no real evidence of a substantial economy. Ceramics, textiles, and some copper goods were things found at burials or religious centers throughout the city.  Specialization  Many of the buildings show detailed specialization, especially in the bricks, where it was necessary to specialize in making bricks. Textiles are very important to this society; they often show great specialization because of the varied array of weaving patterns and symbols (Hyer 1981). There are textiles found at almost every burial site. Also many buildings in the compound show use of textiles or evidence of textiles being made in the building itself. Pacatnamu has the largest number of Moche textiles found to date. (Donnan and Cock 1986) There is also evidence for bead and copper specialization. The textile business was completely dominated by the elite families, who all specialized in, to some degree, textile production.* Usually the peoples associated with being master fishermen were only part-time specialists because their households were usually found outside of the city walls and their refuse piles show an even variation between shellfish and other marine life and wildly collected plants. This suggests that these people spent equal time in fields and in the water working to supply the higher classes with food, but also trying to collect food for themselves.  Artifacts and agriculture   Architecture  Scholars disagree about what architectural style is most represented at Pacatnamu. The Moche and Chimu peoples are the two most usually associated with this site, but recently the Lambayeque group has been associated with Pacatnamu. Most of the archaeologists who work at Pacatnamu study the extensive wall system and the many huacas, truncated pyramids with mound top structures). The largest Huaca is the compound Huaca 1, located in the central portion of the site. The site is found with many distinctions between right and left entrances. Apparently this right-left dichotomy is found in many Chimu sites. The right hand entrances in Pacatnamu are more elaborate, easily accessible while the left is usually filled with debris and more closed off, leading to more domestic buildings where evidence of food preparation has been found. The right side has then been more associated with ceremonial uses and/ or administrative purposes. The architecture is more concerned with visual perception and movement rather than function also leading scholars to believe it was a religious center and not one intended for normal living conditions. *Huaca 1 :: 70 √ó 70m 10m high. The areas around this complex include courtyards, a two-level mound named the East Pyramid, and a large enclosure filled with compels architecture known as the Major Quadrangle. Both Huaca 1 and the Quadrangle are associated with the Initial Chimu phase. *Major quadrangle :: 175 √ó 170m walls were originally 5m tall. There are three main hallways leaving this section the right hall is more architecturally complex and well organized. There is little debris visible, whereas the left entrance is smaller, less complex. Scholars believe this is evidence to Pacatnamu's past as a pilgrimage site. The right was more for ceremony, and/ or administrative purposed, and the left was for everyday use or food preparation. While the majority of this structure comes from the Initial Chimu Phase it also shows much construction from the Terminal Chimu Phase. *Complex A :: Complex A is found leaving out of the West Corridor from the Major Quadrangle. It is notable for its audiencia and a textile fragment depicting a ceremony in progress. *Audiencia :: Contains three Disturbed Burial chambers and an amazing collection of miniature ceramics and 93 miniature textiles, tine ponchos, loincloths, and a crown. *Complex E :: Is found leaving the central pathway towards the entrance gate of the site. The archaeologists found layers of plaster, which suggest a storage facility for ceremonial wood artifacts, adding more evidence that this was primarily a religious center. *Funerary mound (H1M1?) :: Located in the southwestern corner of the Major Quadrangle. It was built using case-and-fill construction and is approximately 30m in diameter and 2.5 m tall. *Huaca 31 & associated structures :: Construction of these structures span the entire history of occupation, but they feature Classic Moche Bricks (flat rectangular) *N. Wall Built with, to a degree, Terminal Chimu Phase bricks (Flat-Bottomed ovoid shape)  Leadership and inequality  The structure of leadership at Pacatnamu is hard to determine because many archaeologists believe it was strictly a ceremonial or pilgrimage site, however Gumerman mentions that some of her research indicates that the elite of Pacatnamu were considered administrative and ritual specialists who were removed from subsistence production. This means the nobility had a place in a governmental/ ritualistic power over others. Some architectural features throughout the site show that peoples of higher rank in the over arching Chimu or Moche culture would come here for ceremonies, so there are special place for them, but there are no names of documents available stating direct leadership in the site of Pacatnamu. In general the architecture throughout the site is an indication of wealth and power differences; the more powerful received grander styles of monumental architecture while the commoners had a very common plain style of architecture. There are no sources indicating that the site of Pacatnamu had a centralized government or leadership system, therefore many archaeologists believe Pacatnamu was a part of a greater civilization. Later periods of occupation show the residence building defensive walls, but later research into those walls suggests that while one main reason for their construction is defense it isn't the only reason. The walls have many functions, but there needed many hands to help build them, so their construction may be because a lord or king asked for them to be built and sent peasants to do the labor. The building of the sites many walls suggests that there was an actual need for defense or whomever controlled the site perceived a threat, either way there have to be an army to help defend the city should it be attacked. While there is no documentation of a physical army or a battle happening at Pacatnamu the walls suggest that a height standing person asked for them because they could with their status and therefore there must have also been an army to help protect those walls. The architecture of the site has been studied extensively and many of the large courtyards throughout the site have a right-left oriented structure. For Pacatnamu the more grandiose buildings with more ceremonial artifacts are found down hallways towards the right while down the left side hallways we find more debris less monumental structures. These left side hallways usually lead to areas that were used for storage or food preparation. The main monumental pyramid, Huaca 1, is surrounded by high walls that completely block the view of the mound from view, these walls have been speculated to keep those who were not allowed to know about or join in on the ceremonies, so this creates a hierarchy of those who can participate and know what's going on and those who cannot. The variation of artifacts throughout the site indicates that those of higher rank had more specialized and unique items and more complex architectural buildings were as the commoners had non- monumental structures and less fine wear beads and textiles. Many of the studied burials at Pacatnamu have many grave goods such as, textiles, ceramics, sacrifices, copper and more. There isn't much differentiation between burials in terms of what's found in them, but some people are buried closer to ceremonial buildings like Huaca 1 and there are some people actually buried within the pyramid itself so that sets them apart from other people. All the burials at Pacatnamu have textiles, which were very important to this culture, ceramics, and copper. Lama sacrifices were important for ceremonies and are rare to find in burials, but there is evidence of this. The textiles found rage in their preservation and the overall quality of the item, the most impressive textiles are associated with people with more status, but there isn't anything else in the burials alerting us to the person‚Äôs identity. Many of the burials at Pacatnamu have been looted so many of the skeletons have been badly damaged. In many all that kind be determined is the age of the person, but not their sex. Around the entrance of Huaca 1 is found a mass burial of mutilated young men. There are three separate burials all on top of one another; each burial was done at a different time. All 14 of the bodies found are of men around the age of 14, many of them died by multiple stab wounds to the chest and back region and it's speculated that multiple people did the stabbing. It's hard to determine why exactly these individuals met with this end, but it may have been part of a ceremony because it's obvious these individuals were not chosen at random. According to ethnohistoric evidence we know that some people accused of rebellion in Incan culture had many different punishments and many of these individuals share these injuries.  Religion and ideology  \\"Pacatnamu offers \\"laboratory conditions\\" for the study of the art, architecture, and population of a major religious center shaped by the dynamics of local development and foreign conquest.\\" - Christopher B. Donnan Throughout the history of Pacatnamu many archaeologists believed it to be a major ceremonial and pilgrimage center for the Jequetepeque valley as a whole, but new evidence suggests that Pacatnamu was likely only used for ceremonies and for political and administrative uses and not for pilgrimages because of the lack of ceramics from the larger Jequetepeque valley and the burials in Pacatnamu suggest only the immediate residents and not a larger population of people. There are no written records from Pacatnamu even after Spanish colonial expansion. By the time the Incas controlled much of Peru the site was already in ruins. Much of its specific history still remains mostly a mystery to us. Overall the general architecture from the Moche period leads us to believe it was a ceremonial or administrative center. There is monumental architecture, which demonstrates that it was the place of many ritual and ceremonies. The only evidence of rituals or ceremonies the offering room and the ritual burial near one of the defensive walls, mentioned earlier. The offering room confused archaeologists when it was first discovered in 1984. It was discovered in the Huaca 1complexe. There were two other rooms connected to it, but they were both completely empty except for room 3, the actual site of the ritual. The room was very full of artifacts including ceramics, bone (both human and camelid), metal, textile, shell, and organic residue. The whole room showed evidence of being burned once all the artifacts had been stored inside. Before this discovery the archaeologists had never encountered this ritual, but in 1995 at the site of Dos Cabezas there was a similar room found with almost exactly the same items inside of it. There is already a tradition in Peru of burning offering so to give them to the gods instead of keeping them on earth. The Incas often burned textiles every morning to begin the day making the gods happy. In Pacatnamu there isn't sufficient evidence to name or actually identify persons of higher ranking, such as kings or priests, but there are a few graves North of Huaca 31 that have evidence of high status people. We have no evidence about specific gods that the people of Pacatnamu believed in.  Death   Treatment of the body  The burials in Pacatnamu do not show much variation between the sexes, but there is a small degree of variation when it comes to children's burials. We do not have sufficient evidence to tell for sure whether or not the peoples of Pacatnamu fit in with the traditional burial techniques of Peruvian ancients, but the Spanish noted that when a village member would die they would be mourned for five days then washed and prepared for burial. The bodies in Pacatnamu show great preservation, but we have no evidence of this practice in Pacatnamu. Women and girls usually have their hair braided, but overall most people are found with their hands and feet wrapped in yarn. Their faces are not always but usually covered in cloth; clothing is also usually present, but this material does not always preserve so we have no way of telling if only some people were buried with clothing or all of them. Textiles are a constant in all burials in Pacatnamu. Donnan and Cock mentioned that the only elite class burial is north of Huaca 31 otherwise all other graves show signs of being those of common people. (Donnan and Cock 1986) Elite peoples were buried in a series around Huaca 31 during the late intermediate period while during the same time frame a large number of common burials were found elsewhere at the site, but the ratio of elites to commoners is more in the favor of the commoners. Their graves are found most often. There are five different ways a body can be encased: *Shroud Wrap *Splint Reinforced *Cane Frame *Cane Tube *Cane Coffin  Burial goods  =Ceramics= Were found in both adult male and female burials. Ceramics are a very constant burial good and artifact all across the site. Gourds: Gourds were used to hold organic goods like corncobs and other agricultural crops although the people of Pacatnamu ate marine life their burial goods were usually agricultural crops like corn and quinoa. Gourds are more common than ceramics in burials. =Plants= Left out in the open plant life is seldom found, most of the data the archaeologist have found come from gourds. =Animals= Animal bones are found in most adult male and female burials, but usually only pieces of the animal, there is only one burial that has a complete llama skeleton. Other animals that have been found include: Fish, Guinea pigs, and birds. =Metal= Copper is found in all burials non-dependent on size or sex. =Decorative elements= *Ear ornaments These are only found in adult female burials. *Beads Found in almost all burials, throughout all ages and non-determinate on sex. *Feathered Headdress Only one of these was found in Pacatnamu. In other Moche sites feathered headdresses have appeared and are usually associated with high standing priests, but in this case the archaeologists believe this is not the case for the Pacatnamu one because instead of being made in copper it is made with bone and of lesser quality, so this is probably a common individuals try and making this type of artifact. *Textiles These are the most common burial good; they are found in all graves, but men usually have more than women. *Spindle Whorls Only found in graves of adult women. *Net Spacers Only found in graves of adult men, these are significant to fishing practices.  Disease and trauma  =Degenerative Joint Disease (Osteoarthritis)= Mostly found in older people in their hips, knees, shoulders, and elbows. Usually associated with regular life stresses on the body. When found in the shoulders and elbows it suggests much upper body labor and when found in the back, knees and hips it suggests much lower body lifting and kneeling. =Rheumatoid Arthritis= Harder to detect than normal arthritis, but the archaeologists are confident they have found minimal skeletal evidence of it. =Dental pathology= Most common people faced usually present with tooth loss and disease. This caused the most day-to-day pain the people of Pacatnamu suffered. This is usually associated with the diet of those living in Pacatnamu, while it was nutritious and well balanced; it was very damaging to their teeth. =Trauma= Fractures and dislocations were very uncommon in Pacatnamu, but the archaeologists found two examples of previously healed fractures, one case of multiple unhealed fractures and one case of a severe spinal injury, it was a skeleton belonging to a middle aged woman whose spine fractured at a 90 degree angle they stabilized the fracture and kept her at that angle for the rest of her life. Her knees showed some signs of stress and the archaeologists agree she continued to move around and function after the injury. There was also one case of an extensive injury to an adult males left eye; it is likely he lost the use of this eye in response to the injury or infection. (Donnan and Cock 1986) The archaeologists found two cases of tumors both were most likely benign and cartilaginous in nature. The first example was discovered in a young male's femur the second case was found in a male's left thumb, it was growing in the bone shaft, this is known as Chondroma. =Developmental Anomalies= #The head of the left radius bone in an adult female: Articular surface of the bone was convex rather than concave, the bones surrounding this were deformed themselves to make room for the deformity. #The right humerus of an adult male was much shorter than the left and his head was very deformed. The left side of his face around the occipital region was much larger than the right side of his skull. #Female spine deformity known as a \\"butterfly\\" vertebrate.  Warfare and violence  Although in the later periods of occupation the Chimu people built an extensive wall system it has been argued that the main point of these walls was not in fact for protection because of the many doors built into the walls. It is obvious thought that the Chimu were expanding Pacatnamu. There is no evidence of warfare specifically, but the mass burial of young men may be an indication that there was a small battle or the mass burial was for strictly religious purposes. Pacatnamu has no written documents to make a historical chronology off of, even once the Spanish arrived they never mention Pacatnamu, this is likely because when they arrive the site is already in ruins and abandoned.  Writing system, art, and symbolism  There was no writing system used in Pacatnamu, so we have no documents or written records to research, but textiles were an extremely important feature of the cultures of Peru and South America. Many of these textiles depict important rituals and ceremonies so they can almost be interpreted as a written document in a more artistic form. Symbols Animals were very important to the culture in Pacatnamu, the black vulture and llamas show up frequently in the textiles. They obviously not only had an important impact on everyday life, with labor and food, but they both hold significant religious properties. Usually in textiles that are depicting a religious ceremony there is one person who appears to be more refined, the one who is probably in charge of the ceremony, but there is no indication about who this person actually is. Hyer details the differences between the many different types of weave that could be used to weave a particular textile. Some designated a finer piece of material. One of the tombs found during the Moche IV holds the remains of an adult female, who is possibly a priestess. She was placed in a cane sarcophagus, or the cane coffin method mentioned above. Buried with her were a series of juvenile camelid placed around the head and feet of other juvenile camelids along with other offerings. There are many burial sites that have camelid bones as offerings this makes it clear that llama were indeed a very important part of the ritual aspect of Moche society. *Plain weave *Tapestry weave *Alternating float weave *Gauze *Openwork *Twill *Complementary weft *Supplementary warp and weft Wool yarn is the most used for weaving and usually makes the finest material. For grave textiles they were usually done in cotton and wool weft, supplementary weft float pattering and plain weave techniques. These patterns are also found throughout the coastal regions of Peru.  End of occupation  The date usually given for the end of the main period of occupation of Pacatnamu is around A.D 1370. Donnan and Cock speculate that there was probably a small group of people who continued to live there, but it was not very extensive. The majority of the population probably left in response to the Chimu conquest of the lower Jequetepeque Valley whose capital was at Chan Chan. Although there was a small group of people in Pacatnamu during this period by the time the Inca conquered the northern coast (A.D 1470) the site of Pacatnamu was empty. There is no indication of why the people finally decided to leave for good, but the site still had significance to outsiders, there is some evidence that people went back and had small ceremonies there, but these were probably only a few families and by no means was it a pilgrimage center. Offerings still appear during the early part of the colonial period, but after this time the site loses its use because no colonial documents note its location or significance.

After graduating from Lake Howell High School, Ertel earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Maryland University College. Ertel completed a \\"mini-MBA\\" program at Rollins College.Meet Mike Ertel  Military service  Ertel served in the United States Army, first in the Infantry and then as a public affairs representative, and took part in Army operations during the 1992 Los Angeles riots; during Operation Able Sentry, in which the United States established a base in Macedonia to monitor sanctions against Serbia; and in Bosnia during the Bosnian War. In the Army, he earned the Meritorious Service Madal, Army Commendation Medal (w/olcand the Army Achievement Medal (w/2olc), among other honors. Ertel undertook training at the Defense Information School.  Career  Ertel returned to Seminole County, where he continued his work in public affairs. After a trio of hurricanes hit Florida in 2004, he was contracted to conduct post-disaster media relations for Visit Florida, which was closely affiliated with the Florida Commission on Tourism. When longtime Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Sandy Goard resigned from her office in 2003, Dennis Joyner was appointed as her replacement. However, in 2005 Joyner announced his resignation as Supervisor of Elections in a letter to then-Governor Jeb Bush, noting, \\"My physicians have advised that I [resign] immediately,\\" which was effective on January 10.

She was born in England and moved to South Africa with her mother when she was 3 years old. During apartheid she was a member of both the Black Sash and one of the few women members of the Afrapix photography collective. Her images have been published in newspapers, magazines and books nationally and internationally. Unlike many of her counterparts, de Vlieg received little public acclaim for her work up until recently. About her work, she says, \\"I wanted to make a contribution to an alternative view of South Africa, a view not seen on the South African TV screen then.\\" Her images cover the following topics: land removals, rural lifestyle, township lifestyle, gender lifestyle, United Democratic Front (UDF), anti-harassment campaign, police violence, protests against death penalty, funerals, Black Sash, protests against incorporation into Bophuthatswana; Release Mandela Campaign, End Conscription Campaign (ECC), conscientious objectors, African National Congress (ANC) Welcome Home Rally, Day of the Vow (Geloftedag), street children, and homeless people.  Life Gille de Vlieg was born Gillian Ruth Hemson in Plymouth, England in 1940 during a Nazi bombing raid on the city. After losing their home in a later bombing raid, she and her mother relocated to Durban, South Africa in February 1944. Her father had been sent by the Admiralty (Royal Navy) to work on radar installations at the Simon's Town Naval Base and later on Salisbury Island, Durban. In 1958, de Vlieg was trained as a nurse at Greys Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. After finishing her diploma, she worked in London and met her first husband, Iain Paton Millar, a journalist. After a short period in Katanga Province of the DRC she moved to Johannesburg in 1963, where her daughters Ruth and Katherine were born. Katherine died when nine months old and her marriage to Iain disintegrated just prior to the birth of her son, Andrew. She lived for a time in Botha's Hill and Durban where she met and married Rob de Vlieg, a sail maker. They moved back to Johannesburg to set up his business in 1975. It was not until 1982 that she joined the Johannesburg Black Sash as a volunteer and she was soon put onto their regional committee and became a vice-chairperson. It was during the height of student riots in Tembisa in 1984 that Gille de Vlieg first made contact with Greg Thulare, an organiser for COSAS in Tembisa. She was slowly introduced to the politics of the UDF and ANC during this time. One of her responsibilities at Black Sash was to work with rural communities which were threatened with removal to the homelands, and she soon became interested in taking photos. When Paul Weinberg asked her to join Afrapix, she replied, \\"Okay, I will come to work for Afrapix, but I'm not working as a secretary, I want to be a photographer.\\" She had a camera and a couple of lenses but knew very little about photography. Paul Weinberg taught her how to process the film and Cedric Nunn taught her how to print. She quickly realised she could use photography as a means of protest. The next several years she spent documenting various townships and rural areas mostly in the former Transvaal. As it was then illegal for a white woman to enter the black townships, she lied to get a permit from the Tembisa Council and eventually was allowed into Tembisa under the guise of taking pictures for Anglo American. While working in Tembisa, she met other members of COSAS including Debra Marakalala, Sipho (Sandile) Qwabe, Tshepo Mphuti and Reuben Mahlagare. Trust developed between them and de Vlieg. Her house in the safe northern suburbs of Johannesburg was often used as a hideout when the police were looking for COSAS activists. In June 1986, de Vlieg was arrested after a raid on her house, initially under Section 50 of the Internal Security Act, and taken to John Vorster Square and then to the Hillbrow police station for thirty-seven days. De Vlieg now lives on the kwaZuluNatal North Coast.  Photography Gille de Vlieg was an activist before she was a photographer, coming to photography through her work with the Black Sash. Many of her images formed part of the Afrapix monthly packages sent to various European organisations to support the fight against Apartheid. The Gille de Vlieg photographic collection is included in the on-line South African History Archive and contains 581 black and white digital images. She is also one of two women featured in Beyond the Barricades. In 2014 she was nominated as a finalist of the Mbokodo Awards.

By lining up the two lights, vessels could navigate the Stamford Channel which no longer exists. They were rebuilt in 1628 and again in 1676. It was at this time that one light was moved up onto the cliffs above the Denes - the location of the present lighthouse - to assist vessels further out to sea;High Lighthouse Including North Cottage and South Cottage, Waveney, British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 2012-10-23. this new 'High Light' was lit using a coal fire brazier. 18th century The remaining 'Low Light' was discontinued in 1706 following sea encroachment, but then re-established in 1730 as a wooden tower that could be easily moved in response to further changes to the Stamford Channel and shoreline.London Gazette, Issue 6953, Page 2, 16 January 1730. It was lit with three candles which showed through a sash window in the upper storey. Rebuilt again in 1779, it was equipped with an open-cupped oil lamp which burned sperm oil. In 1777 the brazier in the High Light was replaced with an innovative form of reflector known as a 'spangle light': 126 lamp wicks (fed from an oil cistern by a common fuel line) were set in a circle around a central column on which were glued 4,000 tiny mirrors; it was said to be visible some out to sea. In 1796 improvements were made to both towers and they were each provided with Argand lamps and parabolic reflectors. 19th century =Low Light changes= In 1832 the position of the Low Light was moved from the Denes to the beach. At the same time it was rebuilt as 'a lantern on a framing of timber upon a brick foundation'.Drawing, 1856. The structure was painted white and a wooden dwelling was built alongside for the keeper. It was also known as the 'Beach Lighthouse'. In the mid-19th century both towers still had Argand lamps and reflectors (eleven of each in the High Light, three in the Low Light); they both displayed a fixed white light. In 1866 the Low Light was again moved and rebuilt (to a design by James Douglass), this time as a wrought iron structure. It was placed on the point of Lowestoft Ness, from the previous Low Light (the position of the Stamford Channel having altered). Accommodation for two keepers was provided in a 'neat white brick building' alongside. The new Low Light (also known as Lowestoftness Lighthouse) was lit by a three-wick oil burner set within a second-order fixed catadioptric optic designed by James Timmins Chance, which gave a visible range of . It was first lit on 15 January 1867 and shone red out to sea but with two white sectors indicating the safe inshore water (or Roads) to the north and the south.London Gazette, Issue 23210, Page 323, 18 January 1867 A fog bell was also provided, which sounded three times every fifteen seconds; it was rung by clockwork. In 1874 the light was converted to run on mineral oil, which was stored in four 220-gallon tanks installed at the base of the tower. In 1881, the Low Light was again improved and showed an occulting light (being eclipsed for three seconds every thirty seconds).London Gazette, Issue 24887, Page 5118, 1 October 1880 In 1883, due to the encroaching sea, the lighthouse was moved inland.London Gazette, Issue 25254, Page 3766, 27 July 1883 In 1894 a reed fog horn had been installed; it sounded a seven-second blast every half minute during foggy weather.London Gazette, Issue 26551, Page 5267, 11 September 1894 It was housed in a wooden building on ground level, beneath the light, along with a pair of two- horsepower Tangye gas engines to provide compressed air. The fog bell continued in use, but only to cover the interval between the appearance of fog and the fog horn commencing to sound. The Low Light was again moved to a new position ( further inland) in 1899, the sea having further encroached on the Ness.London Gazette, Issue 27067, Page 2160, 31 March 1899 At the same time it was converted to run on coal gas, a cluster of seven Welsbach mantle burners being installed within the optic. The burners were switched on and off by clockwork, to preserve the occulting characteristic (the gas being cut off for three seconds every half-minute). The red and white sectors had a range of 13 and 14.5 nautical miles respectively. =High Light changes= The High Lighthouse was repaired and improved in 1825, and also in 1840 (when a pair of houses were built alongside for the keepers). The new High Light, In 1870 the decision was taken to electrify the High Light, and because the tower itself was deemed not to be strong enough to support the new arc lamp and other equipment it had to be rebuilt. The new tower (the present lighthouse) was completed in 1874; however, due to the successful development of paraffin oil as an efficient and economical illuminant in the meantime, the new tower was equipped with a Douglass 4-wick paraffin burner instead. The new High Light was provided with a revolving first-order dioptric optic manufactured by Chance & co., an 'octagonal drum of lenses' which flashed white every thirty seconds. A fixed red light was also displayed, from a window lower down in the tower, towards Corton Sands to the north-east. 20th-21st century In 1901 the High Lighthouse was fitted with a Kitson oil vapour burner, which increased the intensity of the beam from 63,000 to 241,000 candlepower. This was the first installation of an incandescent petroleum vapour burner in an English lighthouse; the initial trial proved successful and subsequently (after modifications were made to the design by Sir Thomas Matthews) they were fitted by Trinity House in all its oil-lit lighthouses. The Low Light was discontinued in August 1923, the Stanford Channel no longer being navigable. In 1938 the High Light was connected to mains electricity; electric filament lamps were installed and placed within a new fourth-order 'twin' optic made up of four dioptric panels (arranged as two side-by-side pairs, placed back to back). The optic was mounted on a mercury float pedestal and rotated by a weight-driven clockwork. Each side of the optic was fitted with an automatic lamp changer, which would substitute a battery voltage lamp for the mains voltage lamp in the event of a power failure; Plant√© batteries were installed and trickle-charged from the mains, to provide the emergency power. The light was automated in 1975 and further modernised in 1997, since when it has been monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Planning Centre in Harwich.

Shires (June 9, 1858 - January 29, 1926), who performed and recorded as Billy Golden, was an American blackface comic and singer who was a popular recording artist between the 1890s and the 1910s. Portrait of Golden, from The Phonoscope, July 1898. Biography He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in St Louis, Missouri. He began performing as a blackface act in vaudeville in 1874 before working as a duo with, first, John Merritt, and then Billy Draiton. He originated a dance move known as the \\"cane pat\\" which became popular with blackface minstrels, and, as part of Bailess and Kennedy's \\"Brightlights\\" vaudeville act, became particularly associated with the song \\"Turkey in the Straw\\". In 1885, he started performing in a duo with his wife, May Golden. In 1891, he recorded \\"Turkey in the Straw\\" for Columbia Records; it became one of the best-selling recordings of the year. He re-recorded the piece many times for Berliner (as well as their successor company Victor), Zonophone, Edison and many others . Other successful recordings by Golden included \\"Uncle Jefferson\\" (1891), \\"Bye Bye, My Honey\\" (1898), and \\"Roll On The Ground\\" (1901). Most of his early recordings were as a solo performer. In 1907 he formed a new duo act with Joe Hughes, and they recorded together for several labels. Golden and Hughes were among the first two-man teams to record blackface minstrel humor in black dialect. After Hughes retired from performing, Golden began working with Jim Marlowe and then, after Marlowe's death in 1917, with Billy Heins. In 1919, Golden reunited with Hughes for several more recordings. After 1920, Golden continued to perform and record as a solo act. He died in New York City in 1926.

Most techniques used to create silver overlay involve the use of special flux which contains silver and turpentine oil. This is then painted on the glass ornament as a design. After the painting is complete, the entire ornament is fired under relatively low heat, it is then cleaned after being quenched and cooled, then it is placed in a solution of silver. A low voltage current is run through the solution and the silver binds in the design, creating a permanent fusion of the silver with the glass. A much older technique of overlay, which was commonly used in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, involves the use of a silver sheet wrapped around the ornament and then the design beaten onto the sheet or it may be burnished. This technique renders the design silhouetted against a dark backdrop and was commonly called the Aftabi design technique. This technique of overlay predates the technique that is common today, but without the use of electroplating, it was a time consuming and tedious process, which could only be accomplished by skilled artisans.  History  The typical thick, palpable silver work, permanently fused with the blue porcelain The history of who first devised the process is unknown. What is known is that from 1870 onwards, a number of patents were filed for the process. Although all patents appear after 1870, it has been suggested that the process may have been discovered earlier, and the patents claimed a short time afterwards. The most well known patent holders are Frederick Shirley from the United States of America, whose patent dates to 1879, Erard and Round who were under the auspices of Stevens & Williams Ltd. whose patent is from 1889, John Sharling also of the USA, whose patent is from 1893 and Friedrich Deusch, the German inventor whose name is most associated with silver overlay today, whose patented the process in 1895 and displayed his work in 1907 at an exhibition in Bordeaux. Deusch returned to Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd in southern Germany where, in 1912, he founded his firm Deusch & Co. Deusch continued exhibiting his wares and gained the Gold Medal at the 1913 World Exposition in Ghent, Belgium. With his presence, Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd became the center of German silver overlay production. Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd (about 20,000 inhabitants in that time) had a long tradition since the 16th century in the art of artists working with gold and silver. A school for applied arts existed there from an early date, which became a school for the precious metal industry in 1907. In the 1920s almost 190 firms were involved in the precious metals industry. The presence of materials, artisans, and component suppliers in on place created an ideal environment for the industry to thrive. After Deusch and Company, other firms specializing in silver overlay were founded. In particular, the firms of Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr and Alfred and Manfred Vehyl were established. Parallel to the development of German silver overlay, silver overlay production was also initiated in the United States.  Technique  Palpable overlay with purest silver The specific feature of German silver overlay is the degree of purity ‚Äì 925 for Sterling silver or 999 for fine silver. The quality of silver used for German overlay can be seen by identifying the impressed 1000 mark (usually on the base or side of an item). The purity and thickness of the silver overlay ensures the beauty of the item is maintained without any loss to the silver even after many years of cleaning. Although other kinds of silver, such as nickel silver, can be sued for silver overlay, the effect is not as vibrant. Bohemian and Venetian Murano glass are often described as silver overlay, but the silver is so thin that it looks as though it has been painted onto the surface, producing a flat effect. Friedrich Deusch invented a way to combine silver and a non-conductive surface such as porcelain or glass with galvanization. He achieved this with a special conductive fluid (a type of flux) which was fixed permanently on the prepared form. The particular objects (such as a vase) were first roughened by engraving or using hydrofluoric acid to etch a design. This implies that a very exact covering of the surfaces had to be achieved to prevent any damage to areas which were not to be overlaid. Maybe they used a masking lacquer which could withstand the following baking in the kiln which was used to fuse the flux with the surface of the item. The next step was to galvanize the item with the purest silver (1000). It was very important to monitor items being overlaid with silver ‚Äì waiting too long resulted in visible dark spots and slight roughness where the cathode or anode were fixed. The cathode and anode were used to charge the item electronically and this allowed the fusion of silver to the area painted with the silver flux. The thickness of silver desired on the finished item determined how long the item needed to be left in the silver bath; this could be more than 30 hours. Finally, if the masking lacquer (discussed earlier) did not burn in the kiln, it must have been removed later (probably with chemical fluids). When colored enamels were to be used on the finished product, they had to be fired prior to the final stage of the silver overlay process. Engraving the silver was the last, and sometimes most laborious, work; it was brought to the highest level by Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr and his workers.  Classifying  A vase of Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr Early items designed and produced by Friedrich Deusch are very classical, and this was followed by an abstract phase of Art D√©co in its purest form. From the 1950s, it was more a concrete style with flowers and so forth. Deusch applied silver overlay to vases, plates, coffee and tea services, and other items. From the outset, the firm of Alfred Veyhl had its own style. It was mostly the combination of polychromatic painted details of birds, flowers, and similar motifs, framed with silver. The more abstract designs are rare. Alfred, and later his son Manfred Veyhl, were the only ones who used a varnish to avoid silver oxidation. Alfred used more softer and rounder lines in his designs, whereas Manfred had a more angular, expressive style. A specialty for this company was that clients could choose from a certain range of porcelain forms and d√©cors. The items were then produced exclusively in a single production run. An outstanding figure is Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr. There is evidence that he learned his skill from Friedrich Deusch (some items of both firms have very similar formal designs). He was not only an artisan but an artist in developing repeating circumferential forms in a perfect and harmonic proportion. Very often it is the pure arrangement of lines (curved or straight), or their combination, with flowers or birds. Never over-designed, but enough to divide the small surface (for example of a vase) in a self-evident and harmonious way. Like the others, not only did he design and apply the silver overlay, he also prepared the porcelain with his own enamel colors, painted the motifs and engraved the silver. Of course he did not produce all these items by himself. Spahr's factory employed about forty specialized workers. The outstanding engraved pieces show the unrivaled quality of Spahr. The early items typically have a thicker silver layer. One can also see the stroke of the brush which proves the overlay and painted surface were handcrafted. Printed designs were used more often on items produced later, especially those of Manfred Vehyl. These can be recognized by studying the design: if the color is flat and full of small dots, this strongly indicates a printed design. Also, the silver work on printed color designs appears not to cover the design closely, as it should. The three companies bought and used porcelain blanks from several well known producers such as Rosenthal, Hutschenreuther, Thomas Bavaria, Krautheim & Adelberg and marketed the finished products under their own names. They also produced silver overlay glass in the same manner. A large amount of glassware came from WMF in Geislingen, which is not far from Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. A respectable amount of glass to be overlaid also came from Jean Beck, a famous glass designer in Munich. Until recently, it was believed that Beck created the brilliant silver designs himself and that Deusch only produced them. However, this was not the case. As with the porcelain, Deusch and others bought the delightfully stylized glass blanks, decorated them in silver overlay, and sold them under their own names.  The marks  Friedrich Deusch used the impressed mark \\"Deusch 1000 / 1000\\" on the early items. This mark was punched directly into the silver. Very often one may also find a red three- digit number on the bottom of the porcelain or glass which indicates this early production. Later, it was replaced by a red stamp which shows a coffeepot and the name Deusch. In addition, to these marks, the following marks may also be found: \\"1000 / 1000 Silber\\" or \\"1000 / 1000 Feinsilber\\". Later items may have the additional mark \\"Made in Western Germany\\". Alfred and Manfred Veyhl used many different marks, stamps and labels (always placed on the bottom of the item). Vehyl's work often shows the \\"1000/1000 silver\\" mark included in the body of the design. Some rare items are signed by handwritten monogram (MV for Manfred Veyhl) and the word \\"Handgemalt\\" (handpainted). Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr mostly used marks impressed directly into the silver. The very earliest and rarest of Spahr's marks began with \\"MSG 1000 10\\" (\\"MSG\\" standing for \\"Manufaktur Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd\\"). This mark was followed by \\"Spahr 1000 10\\" (sometimes stamped in black letters on a porcelain base), later with \\"Spahr 1000\\", and finally with transparent plastic labels on the bottom printed \\"Spahr Feinsilberauflage 1000 / 1000\\". Alvin Corporation, which was later owned by the Gorham Mfg. Co. after 1928, also used special marks. They manufactures pieces of sterling silver flatware, as well as hollowware and special toilet ware. The La Pierre Manufacturing Company also sued special marks. It was established by Frank H. La Pierre in 1885, and headquartered at 18 East 14th Street, NY. It relocated its offices to Newark, NJ before its incorporation in 1895. Their special marks appear on their silver overlay item such as hollowware and novelty items. The Rockwell Silver Company established in Meriden, CT around 1905 created a number designs which featured silver overlay, however they were merged with Silver City Glass Company in 1978, so even though they have done extensive work, there are no unique marks associated with the company. The Gorham Manufacturing Co. which was active from 1848 till 1865 used alion as their mark. They also used a rams head and the phrase \\"coin\\" to mark their items. File:Spahr stamp.JPG File:La Pierre Manufacturing Company Mark (1).png  Sales and Distribution  A Vase of Deusch with preserved label of jewellery store These luxurious products were most often sold in important jewellery stores. Sometimes the retailer's paper labels survived the cleaning attempts of the last decades, and these labels are always a keen addition for any collector. They confirm that silver overlay porcelain and glass was sold all over Germany. Friedrich Deusch, the oldest and biggest firm, also sold internationally and even produced a large amount of silver overlay tableware for the Royal House of Saudi Arabia. Deusch is the only firm that has survived (as of 2013), although the focus of production has changed from fine art to galvanizing parts for the automobile industry. In 1976, after three generations, the Deusch family relinquished interest in the firm of Friedrich Deusch and Company Today, there is scant knowledge and interest about this firm's history. Veyhl (father and son) traveled a lot offering their newest items to different jewellery stores. Later, they opened their own shop in Pl√ºderhausen (close to Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd). Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr created timeless designs which can be found today all over Europe and even in the United States. These are rare, desirable and mostly exquisite. Silver overlay was a very exclusive luxury ware from the beginning because of the very complicated and time-consuming steps of manufacturing. Silver overlay items were never mass-produced and were made in limited numbers. The development of silver overlay was forged by a technical alliance between artists, artisans and advances in chemistry, physics, electronics and, ultimately, the industrialized techniques of the late 19th century. The arts movements of the day were philosophically against industrialized techniques. Yet, ironically, many delightfully decorated pieces of silver overlay porcelain and glass can be seen with superb handicraft and Art Nouveau- inspired designs. Thus, while the handicraft movement died after a single incandescent generation, their designs live on, as do the stunning works of Friedrich Deusch, Friedrich Wilhelm Spahr, and Alfred & Manfred Vehyl.

It is one of the oldest lighthouse locations in Great Britain.  Origins  The first lighthouse was established on St Catherine's Down in 1323 on the orders of the Pope, after a ship ran aground nearby and its cargo was either lost or plundered. Once part of St Catherine's Oratory, its octagonal stone tower can still be seen today on the hill to the west of Niton. It is known locally as the \\"Pepperpot\\". Nearby there are the footings of a replacement lighthouse begun in 1785, but this was never completed because the hill is prone to dense fog. It is sometimes called the \\"salt pot\\".  History  The new lighthouse, built by Trinity House in 1838, was constructed as a stone tower. When first built the light was oil- fuelled; its lamp, with four concentric wicks, was set within a large (first- order) fixed dioptric lens, built by Cookson & co. and surmounted by 250 mirrors (which were later replaced with prisms). It was first lit on 1 March 1840; however, the light was often obscured by fog, which led in due course to the height of the tower being reduced by in 1875. At the same time the lamp was increased from four wicks to six and a system of 'dioptric mirrors' (prisms) was installed to redirect light from the landward side of the lamp out to sea. In 1868 a Daboll trumpet fog signal was installed in a building on the cliff edge; it used an Ericsson 4 hp caloric engine to sound a reed attached to an acoustic horn, once every 20 seconds. In October 1876, the reed was changed to a more powerful siren which sounded two blasts every four minutes. In the 1880s the decision was taken to convert the St Catherine's light to electric power. In 1888 a carbon arc lamp was installed, linked to a powerful set of De M√©ritens magneto-electric machines, powered by three Robey non-condensing compound steam engines. (St Catherine's was the last English lighthouse to be provided with an arc lamp). A new optic was also provided (a second-order 16-sided revolving dioptric lens array by Chance & co.) which showed a five-second flash every thirty seconds. As well as a new Engine House, more cottages were built, to accommodate the additional staff required to operate the generating plant. A new fog signal house was also built in 1888; in it a pair of double-noted 5-inch sirens were installed, sounding through a pair of upright horns, which emerged through the roof and were angled out to sea.postcard image Compressed air for the sirens was piped underground from the engine house, where the three engines were linked to an air compressor by way of a common drive shaft; compressed air was also used to power the mechanism that turned the lens. The sirens sounded two blasts every minute: a higher note followed by a low note. From 1890 a narrow red sector was added to the light, to warn vessels from approaching too near to the shore west of St Catherine's Point.London Gazette, Issue 26038, Page 1975, 1 April 1890 In addition to the flashing light showing red in this direction, a subsidiary apparatus redirected a fixed beam of light upwards from the rear of the main lens and reflected it to shine red in the same direction. In 1901 a series of trials of different sirens and reeds attached to trumpets of different sizes and designs took place at St Catherine's (which had sufficient engine power to produce the required volume of compressed air). The tests were overseen by Lord Rayleigh, scientific adviser to Trinity House, whose distinctive and eponymous design of fog signal trumpet was installed at several different fog signal stations (though not at St Catherine's itself) in the wake of the trials. In 1904 the 16-sided optic was removed from St Catherine's (and installed instead in South Foreland Lighthouse). A new, more powerful 4-sided optic, manufactured by Chance Brothers, was installed in its place.s:1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/Lighthouse The new apparatus, borne on a trough of mercury and driven by a large clockwork mechanism, revolved much faster to give a much quicker flash, once every five seconds.London Gazette, Issue 27720, Page 6452, 7 October 1904 It was said at the time to be 'the most powerful flash-light in [the] country', at 15,000,000 candlepower (compared to the 3,000,000 candlepower formerly produced by the old lens). The beam (albeit reflected on the clouds) could often be seen from Barfleur, 60 miles away. As part of the 1904 upgrade, the red sector light was reconfigured to shine from a window lower down in the tower, below the lantern; it continued to use light redirected from the landward side of the main lamp, by way of a series of lenses and prisms. View of the lighthouse, looking south-west out to the English Channel The arc lamp was decommissioned in the 1920s; by this time it was the last operational arc lamp in a lighthouse in the UK (it is now displayed as an exhibit in Southsea Castle.) It was replaced by a 4 kW filament lamp powered by mains electricity; an automatic lamp changer was provided, to engage a standby electric lamp in the event of a bulb failure (and a standby acetylene lamp in the event of a power failure). The 1904 optic was retained, with the addition of an electric winder to the clockwork rotation drive. By 1932 the fog horn house was being undermined by erosion; it was demolished and a second (smaller) tower was then built alongside the lighthouse to house a new more powerful 12-inch siren. On 1 June 1943 a bombing raid destroyed the engine house, killing the three duty keepers. As part of the post-war repairs, a diaphone was installed in place of the siren. This was itself replaced by a 'supertyfon' air horn in 1962, when new engines and compressors were also installed; the fog signal was discontinued in 1987.  Present day  The 2nd Order Fresnel lens in 2019 Today, the lighthouse has a range of and is the third-most powerful of all the lights maintained by Trinity House. The 1904 revolving optic is still in use (as of 2020). The red sector light, shown from a window lower in the tower, marks Atherfield Ledge. In 2020, Trinity House made a planning application to remove the 2nd order Fresnel lens and replace it with an LED system. A team of volunteers used to provide tours of the lighthouse year round; however in January 2020 Trinity House announced that St Catherine's lighthouse would have to 'close its doors to the visiting public as a tourist attraction' claiming that it was no longer economically viable to keep the visitor centre open. Cottages around the lighthouse can be rented out as holiday accommodation.

Joseph Nelson is associated with the design of at least fifteen lighthouses, mostly in the Bristol Channel. In 1987 the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation and up until 1995 was monitored from the Trinity House area control station at Holyhead. It is now monitored from the Trinity House depot at Harwich,Trinity House : Bardsey Lighthouse Retrieved 16 August 2009 with a local part-time attendant carrying out routine maintenance. Architecture The lighthouse is built of ashlar limestone and is unplastered inside and out, but painted in red and white bands on the outside. The lighthouse tower is 30 m (98 ft) high and is unusual amongst Trinity House towers of this period in being square in plan (Coquet Lighthouse, Northumberland is also square). Unlike many other lighthouses, it retains its original gallery railings, which are of iron and bellied (i.e. curved out in width at their crowns) towards the top. Other examples include Salt Island Lighthouse, at Holyhead, designed by John Rennie in the same year. The present lantern, fitted in 1856, did not require the removal of the original railings. The plinth of the tower is 4 m (13 ft) high and elaborately enriched, and at ground level it forms a square of 7.6 m (25 ft) reducing to 6.1 m (20 ft) at the top of the plinth and 4.6 m (15 ft) at the top of the tower below the crowning cornice, which juts out in a square of 5.5 m (18 ft). The walls are 1.2 m (4 ft) thick at the base reducing to under 0.9 m (3 ft) at the top. Originally, the light comprised reflectors but changed to a dioptric (refracting) mechanism in 1838; the appearance of the original lantern is not known. The present lantern of 1856 is a 4.27 m (14 ft) wide chamfered octagon and the light remained fixed, instead of revolving. The present revolving apparatus was installed in 1873 and gives a group of five flashes, originally driven by a vapourising oil-lamp, but replaced by electric in 1973. The lighthouse is unusual in lacking any sort of harbour or quay facilities. As it is on an established migratory route, the tower has many bird casualties and The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Trinity House have tried to help the problem by providing perches on the lantern top and flood-lighting the tower, although this does not seem to have helped.

England. Flamborough Head Lighthouse acts as a waypoint for passing deep sea vessels and coastal traffic, and marks Flamborough Head for vessels heading towards Scarborough and Bridlington. Old lighthouse The first lighthouse, built by Sir John Clayton, was completed in 1674 and is one of the oldest surviving complete lighthouses in England. Built from chalk, it was never lit. This is now a Grade II* listed building. Current lighthouse The lighthouse The present lighthouse, designed by Samuel Wyatt and costing ¬£8,000 to build, was first lit on 1 December 1806. It had a distinctive light characteristic of two white flashes followed by a red flash. This was provided by the lighting apparatus, which was designed by optics specialist George Robinson, who was also Chief Inspector of Lighthouses at Trinity House. It consisted of a revolving vertical shaft with a three-sided frame on which were mounted 21 argand lamps, 7 on each side, with parabolic reflectors. On one of the three sides the reflectors were covered with red glass: this was the first use of red glass in a lighthouse and represented the first use of the colour as part of a light characteristic; the idea was soon taken up elsewhere. According to a description of the lighthouse written in 1818, the red light was used to distinguish Flamborough's lighthouse from the one at Cromer. A Victorian pilot book used the mnemonic: 'Two whites to one red / Indicates Flambro' Head'. In 1872, a new paraffin lamp was installed to the design of James Douglass. Flamborough was the first Trinity House lighthouse to use paraffin, which had only lately been introduced as a lighthouse illuminant; afterwards, the Corporation upgraded all its oil burners to paraffin. Along with the new lamp, a new first-order dioptric optic was installed, by Chance Brothers of Smethwick, The revolving optic was designed to maintain the lighthouse's characteristic of two white flashes followed by one red flash; the speed of revolution was changed, however, from a flash every two minutes to a flash every 30 seconds. Driven by clockwork, the optic was described at the time as 'a circular frame of six faces, composed of great glass prisms, [...] the third and sixth faces having sheets of ruby glass before them to give the red effect to the light'.

These consumers may consist of multiple communities, are designated by the archive, and may change over time. Organizations determine their Designated Communities and establish standards and guidelines that create a mutually beneficial relationship. Designated Communities can be defined by their occupation, status, or geographic location. Designated Community is a term closely aligned with the concept of Open Archival Information System (OAIS). Each one gives the other a central purpose. The OAIS is a repository of information specified for its designated community. The designated community is the reason the OAIS maintains the information it collects. Designated Communities can change, grow, or shrink over time, depending on the purpose of the information being preserved. Sometimes, designated communities can start as one subset and evolve into a wholly different subset depending on how the information that was originally assigned is being used, or misused.  Example of a Designated Community  Canada‚Äôs York University has a very specific definition for its Digital Preservation Designated Community. They categorize their Designated Communities in terms of ‚Äúprimary‚Äù and ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù communities. This demonstrates their prioritization of the intent behind what is digitally preserved. With a primary community made up of the university‚Äôs faculty, students, staff, and researchers, York University situates that community‚Äôs digital preservation needs above anyone else.  Evolution of a Designated Community  Pepe the Frog was created in 2005 as part of an online comic. As meme culture took hold, Pepe the Frog became an established meme, often shared online by celebrities. As its population grew, the designated community morphed from fans of the author and comic to include members of the alt-right and Donald Trump supporters.

The successor to Sanctum, Sanctum 2 was announced in 2012 and released on 15 May 2013. Setting Sanctum 2 takes place in the future on the planet Loek-III where a major human colony has been established by the Britech Foundation in the city of Elysion-1, a vast elegant metropolis. A previous arboreal settlement, Brightholme, had been set up in the wilderness but had collapsed from repeated attacks by the Lumes, a race of diverse creatures native to the planet. It is hinted that some settlers still survive in the ruins of Brightholme and are part of an obscure organisation known as Tsygan, which is opposed to the vast, almost governmental power that Britech holds. Tsygan is a minority compared to the \\"Brightsiders\\" ‚Äì those who side with Britech. Key to the colonies' survival are Cores, which appear as large blue spheres of energy. They convert inert gases like nitrogen into oxygen, and cleanse areas of toxic mushroom-like spores native to Loek-III, which are linked to Lume activity. The Lumes, which are hostile to Cores, propagate large plant-like access shafts until they are close to a Core, and then launch a coordinated attack on the Core until it is destroyed. If successful, the area will become swamped with poisonous spores. To counter the Lumes, the Britech Foundation has created and armed a military wing known as the Core Guardians, who are tasked to defend the Cores using their arsenal of weapons and defensive towers.

Skye takes a drop pod down to a Britech manufacturing and research centre in the middle of a Lume attack, which she defeats. After the Core Guardians regroup, they fend off Lume attacks on the park of a nearby hotel, a research lab, and eventually the main entrance to the facility centre. After fending off the final wave, which included a dangerous boss called a Walker Patriarch, the Core Guardians are ordered to travel to the nearby rocky fields area, named after its distinctive karst topography. Following their successful defence of the initial core, they are ordered to travel to three other outposts to defend their cores. Eventually, they reach the farthest outpost and receive the true intention of their mission: to reach the ruins of Brightholme and find an abandoned lab containing details on the origin of the attacks. Because of the high spore content of the area, the Core Guardians must travel from old Core site to old Core site, each time activating them to sterilise spores and defending the ensuing Lume attack. Upon finding the lab, it is discovered that the use of the Cores caused an overall increase in spore production, leading to an increase in Lumes. Skye and Haigen decide to keep the data from Britech and instead transmit it to Tsygan, whom they believe would make better use thereof. Off the radar, the Core Guardians then follow the fault lines of earthquakes, which travel in an arc through the areas they have defended. Using the stolen information, they also discover a massive cavern beneath the original facility, which seems to be artificial but has no link to the surface. After trekking through the swamp, they eventually find a massive cavern with a Lume of incredible size (previously shown in the distance in the Sanctum level Aftershock) that releases a torrent of Lumes. The beast, which is the presumed source of the Lume attacks, earthquakes and caverns, fails to destroy the Core, and so instead destroys the area and travels to the surface. The Core Guardians escape its wrath and reach the surface to see it, in full height and gargantuan size, marching towards the skyscrapers of Elysion 1 with a cohort of Lumes. As the credits roll, the barrage of missiles and lasers from the Elysion 1 defences seem ineffective against the beast, and the players are left on a cliffhanger. Reception Sanctum 2 received mostly positive reviews from critics. The game holds an aggregated Metacritic score of 77/100 for Microsoft Windows, based on 28 critic reviews, and for Xbox 360, based on 12 critic reviews.

On the death of Philip II, Prince of Taranto in 1373, Marguerite and Francis claimed Taranto and Philip's Greek lands (chiefly the Principality of Achaea and its dependent territories) and titles for themselves and their son, James of Baux, as the last male descendant of Philip I, Prince of Taranto. Margaret's claim was supported by Pope Gregory XI. Queen Joanna, however, decided to exercise direct rule over the Prince of Taranto's Greek possessions. In April 1374, Queen Joanna decided to suppress the family and stripped Francis of all his lands and titles. This action led to a civil war between the Queen and the Baux family.

Little is known about his musical studies and when or where he was ordained priest. In 1624 Pereira was admitted as chaplain-singer at the Ducal Palace of Vila Vi√ßosa, the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Braganza, the most important title in the peerage of Portugal in the middle of the 17th century. In 1629 Pereira replaced Robert Turner (c. 1578-1629) as mestre de capela.

The film was written by Tessari and Biagio Proietti and based on the novel I milanesi ammazzano al sabato by Giorgio Scerbanenco. La morte risale a ieri sera stars Raf Vallone and Frank Wolff. The film's score was composed by Gianni Ferrio, whose baroque and psychedelic contributions to the soundtrack were described by one critic as inconsistent with the tone of the film. Plot Following the disappearance of his beautiful but mentally handicapped daughter, Avanzio Berzaghi (Raf Vallone) travels to Milan to track her down. Local detective Duca Lamberti (Frank Wolff) investigates the city's pimps and prostitutes for clues, eventually finding the girl's burnt body in a field. Apparently the pimps disposed of the young girl when they heard investigators were looking for her. Berzaghi vows to find the girl's murderer, eventually tracking down his quarry from a clue related to the girl's teddy bear. Berzaghi exacts his revenge, but finds no satisfaction from having done so.

The book was published just a few months before the author's death. Several of Scerbanenco's works featuring the detective character Duca Lamberti were adapted to film around this time, including Milano calibro 9 in 1972 and Il caso Venere privata in 1970. The film's soundtrack was composed by Gianni Ferrio, who had previously worked with Tessari on the 1969 spaghetti western Vivi o, preferibilmente, morti, and would do so again on his 1971 giallo Una farfalla con le ali insanguinate. Ferrio's score spans several musical styles, incorporating psychedelic rock, baroque pop and jazz. Release La morte risale a ieri sera was distributed by Titanus in Italy on September 5, 1970. The film grossed a total of 568,294,000 Italian lire domestically. The film was later released in West Germany as Gemordet wird nur Samtags on July 16, 1971. The film has been distributed internationally under the titles Death Occurred Last Night which had a 95 minute running time in 1970 as well as Death Took Place Last Night and Horror Came out of the Fog. Reception From retrospective reviews, Robert Firsching wrote in AllMovie that La morte risale a ieri seras plot featured \\"a great deal more humanity than is typical for the [crime] genre\\", finding that Tessari's focus on characterisation over plot was its key strength. Firsching commented on the film's score negatively, stating that Ferrio's score and its \\"bouncy\\" tone was inconsistent with the film. The film, and the character of Lamberti, have been seen as precursors to the postmodernist works of American director Quentin Tarantino.

Images as signs of agriculture  Images of agriculture were examined in Sara King‚Äôs thesis work in conjunction with Dr. Emily Rhodes, titled Impressions of Agriculture: Using Semiotics to Decode Agricultural Images. Jennifer Norwood observed similar patterns in her work: A semiotic analysis of biotechnology and food safety photographs, and used these to discuses images associated with agriculture. Agricultural images, according to King and Rhodes, when viewed as semiotic signs of agriculture are viewed on a scale. People with high exposure to agriculture (those with agricultural backgrounds such as FFA, family farms, etc.) tend to associate agricultural images with day-to-day tasks, such as operating farm equipment or getting things ready to plan and objects such as muddy boots or farm tools. Those with low exposure to agriculture (those who grew up in suburban or urban areas) tend to associate the images of agriculture with agricultural or open-space landscapes and finished agricultural food products in grocery stores. There are also those with medium exposure to agriculture, who view agricultural images as somewhere in between industrial and open-space settings of agriculture. In another study, conducted by Leslie Edgar and Tracy Rutherford titled: A Semiotic Analysis of a Texas Cooperative Extension Marketing Packet, agricultural images of this marketing packet revealed five repeating themes that included diversity, relationships, messages portrayed, and stereotypes. According to a study titled: ‚ÄúThe Stuff You Need Out Here‚Äù: A Semiotic Case Study Analysis of an Agricultural Company‚Äôs Advertisements by Emily B. Rhoades and Tracy Irani, agricultural images used in advertisements and in the media typically follow ideological views held by the American public. These ideologies contain stereotypes of those who live in rural areas and those who are directly involved in agriculture or agricultural production. Many of these stereotypes portray farmers in a negative way.  Symbolic, iconic, and indexical modes of visual agricultural signs  Charles Peirce identified three different types of signs: symbolic, iconic, and indexical modes of signs. Symbolic modes of signs are signs that do not resemble the signified; they are arbitrary or purely conventional. An example of a symbolic signs would be the alphabet. Iconic modes of signs are those in which the signifier is perceived as resembling the signified. Examples of iconic signs include portraits and scale-models. Indexical signs are those in which the signifier is not arbitrary but is directly related to the signified. Examples of indexical signs include thunder and footprints. Agricultural images in are typically classified in the iconic and indexical modes of Peirce's modes of signs. Images associated with agricultural typically depict open-space landscapes, farm machinery, farm or ranch workers, agricultural food products, farm clothing, corn, cows, and farm tools.

Composed of recordings that Kaufman made on microcassette from 1977 to 1979, the album was created by several of Kaufman's friends as well as contemporary comedians. Recording Comedian Bill Hader provided narration to bridge the gaps between bits on Andy and His Grandmother Kaufman recorded over 80 hours of material with the intention of recording an album similar to Steve Allen and Jerry Lewis' prank call comedy records‚Äîhis tapes include explicit instructions on how the album should sound. Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies kept the tapes for decades but never found the opportunity to release them until she published a 2009 book of letters sent to Kaufman and her publisher put her in touch with Drag City. The album was compiled by editor Rodney Ascher and comedian Vernon Chatman with narration between tracks by comedian Bill Hader and liner notes by Kaufman confidante Bob Zmuda. The album includes Kaufman's potential plans for faking his own death‚Äîa long-rumored prank that he has allegedly pulled on the public for over 30 years. Chatman is contractually barred from commenting on whether or not Kaufman in fact faked his death. Reception The album has received mixed and positive reviews‚Äîreview aggregator Metacritic has given it a 62 indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Nick A. Zaino III, writing for The Boston Globe called the compilation \\"undoubtedly one of the strangest albums in recent memory\\" making for a \\"perfect tribute\\" to Kaufman. Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound also drew parallels between the ambiguous nature of Kaufman's anti-comedy and these recordings. Ryan Dombal's review for Pitchfork Media emphasizes the timing of the recordings and how Kaufman's act changed from a kid-friendly to an adult-themed performance and notes that this album documents his increasingly provocative act. Charles Pitter of PopMatters gave the compilation a mixed score saying, \\"much of the content is either the start of an idea or what could be considered unfinished business. Despite this, if you're a huge Kaufman fan, it's likely to be of great interest, but potentially it may cause you a wave of depression.\\" Writing for Grantland, Alex Pappademas called the album a \\"landmark\\" and \\"part of Kaufman hasn‚Äôt been fully present in any of his work before\\".

Born in Chicago, Illinois, the third son of Joseph Novy and his wife Frances, grew up on the West Side, near the site where the Great Chicago Fire started in 1871. After attending the local public schools, Novy matriculated to the University of Michigan where he studied chemistry, graduating with a B.S. in 1886. He performed his graduate studies at the same institution, receiving his master's degree in 1887 with a thesis on \\"Cocaine and its derivatives\\". At this time he became an instructor at the University, teaching a course in bacteriology, then was awarded an Sc.D. in 1890 with a thesis titled, \\"The Toxic Products of the Bacillus of Hog Cholera\\". The following year, he completed the work needed to receive his M.D. He was married to Grace Garwood in 1891; the daughter of Dr. V. G. Garwood. Following his graduation, Dr. Novy was made Assistant Professor of Hygiene and Physiological Chemistry at the University of Michigan. He made visits overseas, to the University of Prague in 1894 and the Pasteur Institute in 1897, where he became a friend of Emile Roux and improved his understanding of bacteriology. By 1900, he had gained a national reputation as the foremost national expert of the subject of bacteriology. The same year, he helped to found the Society of American Bacteriologists. He was made full professor at Michigan in 1904 and became the first chairman of the University's Department of Bacteriology. It was early in the twentieth century that Dr. Novy began the study of trypanosomes and spirochetes, for which work he is best known. He developed techniques for their cultivation, and is possibly the first to cultivate a pathogenic protozoan in a laboratory. Among his other work, he performed studies of anaerobic bacteria, investigated an outbreak of the bubonic plague in San Francisco during 1900, researched anaphylotoxin, and studied the metabolism of microorganisms‚Äîespecially the tubercle bacillus. In 1905, he was selected for membership on the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association, a position he would retain until 1930. He was the Henry L. Russell Lecturer at the University of Michigan in 1927, then in 1931 the George M. Kober Lecturer at Georgetown University. In 1930, he was selected to be a gold medalist of the American Medical Association. He continued to contribute to the scientific research in bacteriology for the remainder of his career, publishing his final scientific paper in 1953 at the age of ninety. Much of his later years were consumed by administrative work. He served as fourth president of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1904, and was elected the president of the American Society for Experimental Pathology in 1921 and president of the American Association of Immunologists in 1924. Dr. Novy was chairman of the Executive Committee for the University of Michigan Medical School during 1930‚Äì33, then during 1933‚Äì35 he served as Dean of the University Medical School. He retired in 1935. His wife, Grace Garwood, died in 1946; Dr. Novy died at his Ann Arbor, Michigan home in 1957. He was survived by three sons and two daughters. All of his sons were practicing physicians. In Sinclair Lewis's 1925 novel Arrowsmith, Dr. Novy was the model for the character of Max Gottlieb.

Its common name is Amazon lava lizard. Etymology The specific name, torquatus, is Latin meaning \\"adorned with a neck chain or collar\\". Amazon Lava Lizard in Iguaz√∫ National Park, Argentina Geographic range It is native to South America, where it can be found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname. It is one of the most widely distributed species of genus Tropidurus. Description This is a medium-sized lizard with a relatively large head. Its scales are overlapping. The reproductively mature female ranges from snout-to-vent length (SVL). One sample of adult males had a mean SVL of , while another found a mean SVL of . Habitat This lizard lives mainly in open habitat types, especially restinga, part of the Atlantic Forest biome. It may occupy disturbed and degraded restinga. It is also known from the Abrolhos Archipelago, indicating that it can colonize offshore islands. It lives in the Cerrado. It may be found in residential areas, where it is adept at climbing the walls of houses. It is mostly ground-dwelling, living in termite nests and on or under rocks and logs.Ribeiro, L.B., et al.

It especially favors the fruit of little coca during the summer. Territoriality The male of the species is territorial. The male performs signalling behaviors such as head-bobbing and tail-whipping and exhibits aggressive behaviors such as chasing and fighting with other males. Larger, faster males tend to dominate higher-quality territories, such as those with many hiding places and abundant sunlight. Females prefer higher-quality territories and accept the males guarding them; a male may have access to a harem of several females in a good habitat. Reproduction The female may lay several eggs at a time, but a clutch of two is common, particularly in coastal areas. Clutch sizes may be larger in other geographical ranges. Bipedalism Another notable behavior of the species is occasional bipedal locomotion. It can run relatively quickly on its hind feet for a limited distance. It carries its body in an oblique position, lifting its hindlimbs high. It swings its forelimbs in phase with its hindlimbs, i.e. swinging its right forelimb as its right hindlimb comes up, and its left with its left.

The book discusses competitive business strategies. It made The New York Times Best Seller list after the authors placed orders for thousands of copies of their own book. Content The core of the book is based on five years of research by the authors into companies such as Wal-Mart, Dell, Southwest Airlines, Cott, Airborne Express, Atlantic Richfield, Home Depot, Intel, and Sony. It opens with several business questions, such as \\"Why is it that Casio can sell a calculator more cheaply than Kellogg's can sell a box of corn flakes? Does corn cost that much more than silicon?\\" The book raises questions about American business management and practices and then attempts to answer them. It also examines the financial benefits for companies that focus primarily on customer satisfaction rather than shareholder profits. The book provides a business model based on three dimensions (called 'Value Disciplines\\"): # Customer Intimacy # Product Leadership # Operational Excellence and postulates that any successful business needs to maintain at least \\"acceptable\\" levels of performance in each of the three dimensions but would need to choose one of them to become a market leader in its field. The model suggests that if you truly want to excel in any of the three disciplines you will have to make sacrifices in the other two as these become mutually exclusive. Reception The book debuted on The New York Times Best Seller Non-Fiction list on February 26, 1995, and remained on the list for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 4. The book also debuted at No. 1 on the Bloomberg Businessweek best-seller list on April 1. In 2012 it was reported to have sold over 250,000 copies. Lois Weisberg stated the book \\"Provides great insight into the linkage of product value, operating excellence and customer focus,\\" and Dale Dauten also spoke highly of it. Allegations An August 1995 article in Bloomberg Businessweek by Will Stern first alleged the authors had manipulated sales of their book. Treacy and Addison-Wesley denied trying to manipulate sales, though Stern states according to his sources the campaign was orchestrated by Treacy and carried out with the help of Wiersema, Addison-Wesley and CSC Index, an international consulting firm Treacy regularly consulted for. It was revealed that the names of the bookstores that would be used to gauge book sales for The New York Times Best Seller list had become known, and that orders for the book had been placed at those stores. Stern states he interviewed dozens of book store owners, including one who took a suspicious order for 125 copies of the book shortly after it was published. After also interviewing over 100 book industry representatives, Stern concludes the authors spent over $250,000 buying over 10,000 copies of their own book. The authors admitted to buying \\"fewer than 10,000\\" copies of the book for clients and prospective clients. Stern also states CSC Index was used to covertly purchase an additional 30,000 to 40,000 copies. He traced many purchases of the book to CSC employees and affiliates. Most CSC affiliates refused to comment on the issue; however, the President of Paragon Co, a database marketing firm in Oxford, Ohio, confirmed that CSC had reimbursed him for over 10,000 copies of the book that he ordered for his firm, costing over $200,000. It was reportedly boasted around the office at Paragon Co that the company was involved in a scheme to make the book a best-seller, and so many copies of the book arrived at the firm they were stored in a tractor trailer. An independent book store in Manhattan sold 2,500 copies of the book to a consulting firm in Chicago. The New York Times initially stated they were aware of the bulk book sales, and that they were confident the bulk sales had not increased the books position on the best- seller list. After reviewing the article in Bloomberg Businessweek, however, the editor of The New York Times book review section stated it was possible that the result had been manipulated, but that the process \\"would be so expensive that [they'd] have to have another reason for doing it beyond simply boosting book sales. It is alleged the authors spent money on their own book in order to gain the benefits that are common from making The New York Times Best Seller list, such as speaking engagements and consulting opportunities, as well as further book sales, as chart success often begets more chart success. Treacy was said to be giving around 80 speeches a year, increasing his speaking fee from $25,000 to $30,000 after featuring on the best-seller list. While it is uncertain if the practice is illegal, the tactic has been described by publishers and booksellers as highly unethical. Following the incident The New York Times improved their methods for filtering bulk sales from affecting the list, and made a better effort to hide the names of stores that were reporting for them.

In November 2012, 247Sports announced a content partnership with CBS Sports, in which 247Sports would provide content for its digital platforms (including CBSSports.com), and CBS Sports Digital would handle advertising sales for the site. In May 2013, 247Sports reached a long-term agreement to become the official online selection partner of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and the U.S. Army National Combine, replacing its competitor Rivals.com. In December 2015, CBS announced that it had acquired 247Sports. In February 2017, 247Sports acquired Scout.com. In October 2017, 247Sports announced a partnership with Pro Football Focus, in which it would provide coverage of Division I FBS college football for the website, including a PFF College microsite and integration of its player grades and rankings across 247Sports. In August 2020, founder and CEO Shannon Terry left the company. 247Sports Composite 247Sports features two ratings for high school football and basketball recruits: its own in-house evaluations done by its scouting staff, and also the 247Sports Composite ratings.

The Composite originally combined the ratings from 247Sports' in- house ratings, Rivals.com, ESPN, and Scout.com. Since 247Sports' acquisition of Scout in 2017, the Composite now only includes the former three constituent ratings. The Composite also does not include any athletes that do not yet have a recruiting profile on 247Sports, to prevent spoofs from other sites.

Sometimes linked with the so-called Berkeley Mafia group of economic advisers which included senior Indonesian economists such as Widjojo Nitisastro, Emil Salim and Ali Wardhana, Sumarlin held various important economics posts in the Indonesian government for many years until the late 1990s. He graduated from the Faculty of Economics, University of Indonesia (FEUI) in 1958. Positions held in government included, among others, Chairman of Supreme Audit Agency, Minister of Finance, Chairman of the National Planning Agency (Bappenas), and Minister for Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform.Bondan W., J.B. Sumarlin, Cabe Rawit yang Lahir di Sawah [J.B. Sumarlin: The Chilli born in a Rice Field], 2012, Jakarta, P.T. Kompas Nusantara.  Early life  Sumarlin graduated with an M.A. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1960, and a doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh in 1968. His master's thesis was about Some Aspects of American and Indonesian Fiscal and Monetary Policies: A Comparative Study and his doctoral's thesis was entitled Some Aspects of Stabilization Policies and Their Institutional Problems: The Indonesian Case 1950-1960. After graduating with an undergraduate degree (S1 in the Indonesian system) at the University of Indonesia in 1958, Sumarlin served as a teaching assistant for some years. In 1965 he was appointed as a lecturer in the FEUI, then as a professor in 1979. Previously, he had worked in an industrial company in Jakarta. During earlier political struggles, Sumarlin had worked as a member of the Indonesian Red Cross, and as a recruit in the Indonesian army (Tentara Nasional Indonsia, or TNI) in East Java. For his service, in 1973 he received the Mahaputra Utama star, one of the highest honours awarded in Indonesia. Two years later he was awarded the Grand Cross in the Order of Leopold II of the Belgian government. In his private life, Sumarlin was a sports enthusiast and enjoyed tennis and jogging. He was married to Th. Yostiana Soedarmi. Together they had four children. Sumarlin had a slight build and this was associated with an incident that became well known among his colleagues in Jakarta. Around 1969, during the early stage of the work of the New Order government of president Soeharto, in his position as Deputy Minister of the Indonesian National Planning Agency, Bappenas, Sumarlin was often required to accompany the Chair of Bappenas, Professor Widjojo Nitisastro, to Cabinet meetings. During one of the meetings at the National Palace, Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono is said to have casually gestured towards Sumarlin asking, \\"Who is the boy sitting there, Widjojo?\\" Widjojo then introduced Sumarlin to the Cabinet Secretary. Sudharmono responded that, indeed, he recalled that Widjojo had mentioned that he was recruiting a team to work with him in the National Planning Agency. After the incident, Sumarlin was reluctant to continue attending Cabinet meetings, knowing that attendance was usually severely limited and the names of participants needed to be notified to Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono beforehand. But Widjojo encouraged Sumarlin to continue attending. Widjojo's approach proved correct because, in time, Sumarlin became one of Soeharto's most trusted economics advisers. While serving as Deputy Chair of Bappenas, Sumarlin was closely involved in drafting government reforms with guidance from Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono. He was regularly involved, for example, in the preparation of the key Annex document attached to the Presidential State Address released on August 16 each year for presentation to parliament. He was also actively in government administration as a member of various official teams charged with reviews of procedures governing such things as controls over the procurement of goods and equipment. Experience in government Although of modest stature and known for a disarming smile, Sumarlin became an effective minister during the period of the New Order government in Indonesia. From 1970 through to 1998, he was influential in guiding economic and financial policy. Along with Widjojo and other ministers in the economic team, Sumarlin became a key economic policy adviser to president Soeharto. From 1970 to 1973 Sumarlin was secretary to the Indonesian Monetary Board. Previously he had held the post of deputy minister for Fiscal and Monetary Affairs in the Indonesian National Planning Agency. During the next ten years (1973‚Äì1983), Sumarlin served as Minister of State for Administrative Control. Later, between 1983 and 1988, he was appointed to the position of State Minister for National Development Planning, concurrently holding the post of Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas). On the sidelines during that period he was appointed interim Minister of Finance, and also Minister of Education & Culture ad interim replacing Prof. Dr. Nugroho Notosusanto who died in 1985. Sumarlin then became Minister of Finance in the Fifth Development Cabinet (March 21, 1988 ‚Äì March 17, 1993). Subsequently, before the fall of the New Order government in 1998, he was appointed to the senior post of Chairman of the Supreme Audit Agency (Badan Permeriksaan Keuangan, or BPK).

The first church to be established in the Jacksonville Beaches, it dates to 1887 with the construction of its original building. The current building was dedicated in 1967. Early history In 1886, a small group of locals in Pablo Beach, Florida (now Jacksonville Beach) and regular guests of the Murray Hall Hotel joined to host Episcopal services. Service was held at the hotel, as there were no churches in the Jacksonville Beaches area at the time. The following year, congregants raised $800 to build their own chapel, which was designed by architect Robert Sands Schuyler. The Atlantic Railroad donated land on the corner of 2nd Avenue South and 2nd Street.History will come alive Sunday morning in quaint Jacksonville Beach chapel  members.jacksonville.com The chapel sat empty in 1902 and 1923. Year- round services began in 1925, and St. Pauls-by-the-Sea became its own parish in 1940. As the congregation grew, the church made plans for a new, larger building.Saint Paul's By-The-Sea Episcopal Church (AIA Florida Top 100 Buildings) It acquired land at 11th Avenue and 5th Street North and moved the original chapel building there in 1953. It was renovated and expanded a few years later. In 1967 the congregation dedicated its current building, a substantially larger modern structure. Three years later, the congregation sold the original chapel to Central Christian Church at the Beaches, now Beaches Chapel. Its new owners relocated the structure to their property in nearby Neptune Beach. Beaches Chapel later built its own larger church, and used the small chapel primarily for Sunday services, weddings, and for the students at its school. In 2011, Beaches Chapel sold the building for $1 to the Beaches Area Historical Society, who moved it once more to Beaches Museum & History Park on Beach Boulevard, near its original location. Current building The modern church was dedicated in 1967. It was designed in the modern style by Blake Ellis and is made of coquina concrete. On April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects' Florida Chapter included the building in its list of \\"Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places\\".

Over the next day, the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February. After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo. The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu. Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March.

The extra-tropical remnants of Esau made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, where hail and a tornado were reported to have occurred. The name Esau was subsequently retired from the list of tropical cyclone names for the South Pacific basin. __TOC__ Meteorological history Towards the end of February 1992, a monsoon trough of low pressure was located over the South Pacific Ocean, between northern Australia and the Samoan Islands. A shallow tropical depression subsequently developed within this monsoon trough during 24 February, about to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. Over the next day the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February. After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa, before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo. Early on 26 February, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to issue advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 21P, while it was located to the east of Espiritu Santo. Later that day the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that the system had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Esau. Throughout that day as Esau intensified further, it moved south-westwards and away from the islands of Vanuatu. Esau subsequently accelerated westwards to the north of an intense subtropical ridge of high pressure and gradually intensified further as it moved into an area of decreasing vertical windshear. During 28 February, the system became a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while it was located about to the west of Espiritu Santo. During that day the system intensified further before it started executing a second clockwise loop as the subtropical ridge weakened and placed the system in an area of weak steering. The FMS subsequently reported that the system had peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . The system subsequently moved into the Australian region and brought gale-force winds to the Solomon Islands during 29 February. The JTWC also reported that Esau had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of , which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Over the next few days the system moved south-eastwards and back into the South Pacific basin, under the influence of a northwest steering flow and threatened the southern islands of Vanuatu. The system subsequently came to within of southern Vanuatu before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. The system made landfall near Ponerihouen in the French territory of New Caledonia during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As a result of passing over the mountainous island nation and increasing vertical wind shear, the system continued to weaken and transitioned into an extra tropical cyclone over the cooler waters of the Tasman Sea. The extra tropical remnants of Cyclone Esau subsequently made landfall on New Zealand's North Island in the Taranaki and Hawkes Bay area during 8 March, before they were last noted during the next day over the South Pacific Ocean. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau caused minimal damage as it affected the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and New Zealand, before the name was retired from the Lists of tropical cyclone names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. Esau first affected the northern Vanuatu Islands between 25‚Äì27 February, with heavy rain and strong winds of up to . The system subsequently affected the southern islands of Vanautu between 2‚Äì3 March, when it was considered to be as powerful and potentially damaging as Cyclone Uma. However, there was no damage or any gale-force winds reported in Vanautu, after the system had become the fourth tropical cyclone to affect the island nation during the 1991‚Äì92 season. The system subsequently became the fourth tropical cyclone to affect the Solomon Islands, during the 1991‚Äì92 season between 27 February ‚Äì 4 March. At its closest point of approach to the island nation between 28‚Äì29 February, Esau produced gale-force winds on the islands of Bellona and Rennell and knocked down several banana, coconut and pawpaw trees. The system also destroyed several houses and severely flooded various taro gardens and food crops. It was subsequently estimated that relief workers, would need to provide aid for around 5000 people on the two islands. After affecting both Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, Esau became the strongest tropical cyclones to affect New Caledonia on record as it made landfall on the northern region of the island nation with hurricane-force winds between 4‚Äì5 March. Ahead of the system making landfall, the maximum alert was introduced for most of the island nation, before it was extended out to cover the whole territory. Within the French territory wind gusts of were recorded in N√©poui and Cap N'Dua, while a wind gust of was recorded in Poindimi√©. Extensive flooding was reported in the territory while rainfall totals of , and were recorded in Kop√©to, Tiendanite and Tiwaka. Several roads were blocked as the system blew down trees and damaged buildings, while power and communications were also knocked out over the island. One person drowned as she tried to cross a river near Hienghene, while a young child went missing on the island of Lifou but was later found safe by local residents. Severe Tropical Cyclone Fran subsequently affected the northern part of the French territory between 10‚Äì11 March. On 8 March, the extratropical remnants of Esau made landfall on New Zealand's North Island in the Taranaki and Hawkes Bay area.

The main figure in the festival organising company, Music Power, was Hamish Henry, a young Adelaide millionaire entrepreneur who had a continuing involvement with rock music in the early '70s. As well as organising the Myponga festival, Henry managed several of the headlining local bands, War Machine and two other Adelaide groups, Headband and Fraternity. Trevor Brine was the festival's booker and artist liaison and Alex Innocenti sold some tickets through his Blues Cellar and assisted Trevor. The festival was headlined by heavy metal pioneers, Black Sabbath. Cat Stevens was advertised as co-headline artist at the festival but he cancelled to perform in Los Angeles. The compere was Adrian Rawlins, who wrote of his experiences at Myponga, and other festivals, in his book Festivals in Australia: an Intimate History (1982). Another international act was Syrius, (from Hungary, see Jackie Orszaczky). Alex Innocenti tells a tale that perfectly illustrates Hamish Henry's desire to fund the venture at any cost: \\"We went down to the farm at Myponga in Hamish's great American sports car with no roof, like movie stars,\\" he recalls. \\"The farmer says, \`What do you guys want?' and Hamish says, \`I want to buy your farm.' He gave him a $1 deposit and paid him the next week.\\" Innocenti says he has no idea what's happened to Henry. Australian artists included Daddy Cool, Spectrum, Fraternity, Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, Fanny Adams, Jeff St John's Copperwine with Wendy Saddington, Company Caine and Chain; South Australian artists included Steve Foster. The Canberra Times correspondent reported that the \\"festival rocked to a close tonight after taking l days to warm up. The pop crowd, estimated at 8,000, started arriving at the 62-acre farm at Myponga early on Saturday morning. Most of them had brought plenty of alcohol and, although violence did not erupt, the atmosphere at the festival was tense at times.\\" The promoters did not make any profit. Author Clinton Walker in his book 'Highway to Hell: The life and death of Bon Scott' described the Myponga Festival: \\"With a bill boasting an exclusive appearance by Black Sabbath as well as the cream of Australia's progressive bands, Myponga - bankrolled by Hamish Henry was the biggest thing to hit Adelaide since the Beatles...\\" In March 2013 Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne recalled the group's debut Australian performance, \\"That was the Myponga Pop Festival if I remember right? Management told us we'd have an exact copy of our amplifiers there, which we thought was great, but when we got there they were nothing like our amplifiers! But you know what? You get up there and do your best and I had a good time.

Definition  There are two generally recognized senses of the term Sino- Christian theology. In the broad sense, it belongs to the tradition of indigenous theology which stretches as early as the works during the time of the Jesuit China missions, until the present day. However, these indigenizing efforts are often critiqued for a lacking in their assessments of traditional Chinese culture, particularly as found in Confucianism. In the narrow sense of the term, Sino-Christian theology is associated with cultural Christians like Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu who have challenged the indigenizing approach and have proposed the greater need to articulate a critically reflective theology using the Chinese language. In recent years, it has been observed that there has perhaps been the growth of a younger generation of scholars in Sino- Christian theology. While the earlier generation included so-called \\"cultural Christians\\" () who often used methodologies within the humanities and social sciences, the younger generation includes individuals who identify themselves as ‚ÄúChristian scholars‚Äù () with a greater commitment to the Christian faith and believe the use of the human sciences is inadequate for articulating Christian theology. Many have become elders and pastors in urban churches, and often gravitated towards Calvinism as a means to offer a public theology for the Chinese Christian church.  Theological themes  Much of the writings within this field have looked at Christian theology as a means to engage China, in its pursuit for modernity. Often, this has focused on comparing Western culture, shaped by Christianity, with Chinese culture, shaped by Confucianism and Daoism. One areas of discussion has been around the Christian doctrine of sin. Liu Xiaofeng and Zhuo Xinping, for instance, have described China as having a \\"culture of joy\\" whereas the West has a \\"culture of sin.\\" In a post-Cultural Revolution context, they explain how the doctrine of original sin is useful in explaining the social ills that exist in contemporary Chinese society. Another area is with regards to morality. Whereas Confucianism is often understood as fundamentally a system of ethics, some have written about how the Christian understanding of morality has been shaped by the two commands of loving God and loving neighbor. Yang Huilin has gone as far as to compare Auschwitz with the Cultural Revolution, and speak of how the Christian virtues of love and forgiveness may benefit the Chinese context.

Life  Born in Madrid, she wrote under the masculine pen name of Remigio Andres Delafon. In 1884, she became the first woman speaker in the Ateneo de Madrid. She was considered to be both controversial and a bold freethinker in her time. Her radical thinking and critique on many controversial subjects of religious dogmatism, atheistic approach, illegitimate births, civil marriage (with the eventuality of divorce) created serious controversies. Cited as the \\"first woman playwright to have a theater closed down\\", she died at her own home in Gij√≥n, Asturias on 5 May 1923. Early life She was born in Madrid in 1851, in a well-to-do family. Taught by her father, she started writing poetry in castilian early in life. Other than that, not much more is known about her early life. She got married at the age of 25 to Infantry Lieutenant Rafael de La Iglesia and resided in Pinto (Madrid). Some time later they separated and he died in 1900. She did not marry again. Career 220px Her first publication was in 1874 in a local journal. In 1876, her first poetry based drama titled \\"Rienzi el tribuno\\" premiered at the Teatro Circo de Madrid, which received wide acclaim. In this drama, she presented in poetry form, a tragic theme highlighting the struggles that the Roman tribune Cola di Rienzo had to go through to bring to fore ancient Rome's greatness. In 1877, she published the play called \\"Amor a la patria\\" (Love of Country), depicting women's heroism as part of the peasants struggle against Napoleon Bonaparte's rule. In 1884, she was the first woman speaker to read her poetry in the Ateneo de Madrid poetry evening. In 1891, she published \\"El padre Juan\\" (The Father John), dealing with the hypocritical nature of the clergy, which caused some controversy. This was followed by the \\"La voz de la patria\\" (Pregnant Woman), in 1893, which also resulted in a lot of controversy as the drama highlighted the shenanigans of a pregnant woman trying to stop her fiance to enlist in the army. 220px She made significant contributions in poetry and some of them are: \\"Ecos del alma\\" (Echoes from the Soul) (1876); \\"Morirse a tiempo\\" (To Die on Time) (1880); \\"Sentir y pensar\\" (Feeling and Thought) (1884). In her approach to propagate the liberal social policy of the government she wrote the paper titled El crimen de la calle de Fuencarral; odia el delito y compadece al delincuente (The Crime of Fuencarral Street: Hate the Crime and Pity the Criminal) around 1880. This was based on a true crime of a murder case; her intent was to raise awareness of the social roots of crime. Her essays related to feminist issues are the \\"Consecuencias de la degeneraci√≥n femenina\\" (Consequences of Female Degeneracy) (1888); and Cosas M√≠as (My Things) (1917). An advocator of civil marriage, she believed in liberation. After the death of her husband in 1900, she shifted to Cueto (Cantabria) and started a poultry farm. At the same time she also started writing for the socialist weekly, Cantabrian and People's Voice. In 1909, she built her house on the top of a hill in Gijon and named her house as \\"Providence.\\" As an article she had written in a Paris newspaper was very controversial, she was exiled to Portugal in 1911 for two years. On her return she collaborated with Virginia Gonzalez and Theodomir Men√©ndez (1919) in the activities of the socialist party. She died at her home in Gijon on May 5, 1923.

Retrieved on 2013-07-28. but then forgotten, being re-discovered in 1935 and first printed in 1936 by Luka Mathai Plathottam at Athirampuzha St Marys Press in the year 1936. Varthamanappusthakam postulates that the foundation of Indian nationalism rests on the basic principle that India should achieve civic self-rule. Long before the debates on nationalism shaking the intellectual circles of Europe, Asia, and Africa, Thoma Kathanar offers a distinctive positionality as a minority Syriac Christian priest and subsequent administrator of the Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Kodungalloor with transnational ties to Portuguese ecclesiology who nevertheless argues in favor of autonomous Indian civic governance.http://www.nasrani.net/2013/01/28/nazrani-history-and-discourse-on- early-nationalism-in-varthamanapusthakam/#identifier_53_1038 It gives the history of a journey undertaken by the author along with Mar Joseph Kariattil from Malabar Coast (modern day Kerala) to Rome via Lisbon and back. Kottyam The manuscript of the book is kept at the St Thomas Christian Museum in Kochi. The historic journey to Rome to represent the grievances of Kerala's Syrian Catholics started from the boat jetty in Athirampuzha in 1785. From Athirampuzha they first proceeded to Kayamkulam by a country-boat. The journey then took them to Chinnapattanam, as Chennai was then known. From there they went to Kandy in Ceylon (Sri Lanka of today). From Ceylon they sailed to Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa. They were to sail to Portugal from there but adverse winds drifted their ship in the Atlantic Ocean taking it to the coast of Latin America. A further journey from the Latin American coast took them to their destination. The journey to the destination took more than a year. While they were in Europe, Mar Joseph Kariattil was ordained in Portugal as the Bishop of Kodungalloor Archdiocese - the first native Indian to get this appointment. The two representatives of the Kerala Catholic Church succeeded in convincing the church authorities in Rome and Lisbon about the problems in Kerala Church. On their way back home they stayed in Goa where Mar Kariattil died. Upon realizing that his end was near, Mar Kariattil appointed Thoma Kathanar as the Governador (governor) of Cranganore Archdiocese after him, and handed over the cross, chain and ring, the tokens of his power, which had been presented to him by the Portuguese queen.

It covers across four blocks of land - Pirongia (the largest), Te Maunga O Karioi Block, and the small Mangakino Block and Te Rauamoa Block. The park encompasses Mount Pirongia west of Pirongia and Mount Karioi near the coast southwest of Raglan. Wairƒìinga / Bridal Veil Falls Scenic Reserve is also in the area, but is separate to Pirongia Forest Park. Flora and fauna The park's climate is mild and wet, with humid summers and temperate winters. The area around Mount Pirongia receives over 2,400 mm of rain per year. Most of the park is covered in podocarp forest of rimu, totara, kahikatea and tawa with a dense understorey rich in tree ferns. Pirongia Forest Park lies at the natural southern limit of kauri forest. Towards the south of the forest park, the forest increasingly contains beech. The forest is inhabited by many native bird species such as kerer≈´, tui, bellbirds, fantails, morepork, and silvereyes, as well as rarer birds such as grey warblers, tomtits, and the occasional kaka. Kahikatea, tallest native tree in NZ Recreation The park contains several short walks as well as longer bush tramps leading to the summits of both mountains. Popular walks are the Nikau Track, also suitable for cycling, and a walking track to the Kaniwhaniwha Caves, two small limestone caves. A longer track, following the Bell Track, leads to the tallest kahikatea tree. This 66.5 m tall tree is the tallest recorded native tree in New Zealand. The Bell Track continues to the Mount Pirongia summit, which is also accessible via other tracks. Recreational hunting is encouraged, as it controls introduced wild animal populations such as goats. Brown trout can be found in the Kaniwhaniwha Stream. Permits/licenses are required for both activities. Accommodation options are three free campsites, a lodge, and a hut near the summit of Mount Pirongia.

The Chapel is under the jurisdiction of St. Joseph de Gagalangin Parish, and covers six barangays. Its Feast Day is celebrated every third Sunday of March. History On March 23, 1922, a young labourer named Crispino Lacandaso was chopping wood from a felled, hundred year-old sampalok (Tamarindus indica) tree on an empty lot at 1885 Juan Luna Street, Gagalangin, Manila, Lacandaso initially had difficulty cutting the trunk, but upon finally cleaving in twain, he saw a dark cross on a base, imprinted on both halves of the wood. The pieces of wood were subsequently encased in glass, and devotees from other parts of the city flocked to the site, and a small chapel was later built to enshrine the wood. Renovations The 2009 renovation completely altered the Chapel, adding a second altar and two more floors to the structure. On the second floor is the new choir loft, while a rooftop area and bellcote are on the third. The altar was also overhauled, and the Chapel received a new set of liturgical vessels. In 2013, the fa√ßade of the first storey was redesigned to appear as though it was built in the 19th Century. The two crosses outside changed into a wooden cross, while the wall was changed into adobe. Devotion During the fiesta, many people go to the Chapel to venerate the crosses, showing gratitude for the past year's blessings. On Maundy Thursday, many people from provinces and other cities in Metro Manila select the Chapel as a station as they perform the traditional Visita Iglesia pilgrimage. Feast Day The Chapel's Discovery Day is on 23 March, but the actual celebration is held on the third Sunday of March. A triduum of Masses precedes the day of the fiesta. On the feast day itself, two Masses are celebrated: one in the morning and one in the afternoon, followed by a procession. The fiesta commemorates the alleged miraculous properties of the chapel's twin crosses.

Muricy and J.S. Pearse. It is believed to be native to intertidal waters in the north east temperate Pacific Ocean and was first found in seawater aquaria in that region. It is used as a model organism in evolutionary biology. Description Oscarella carmela is either encrusting or massive and forms a slimy covering or a thicker layer of spongy matter with an uneven, lumpy, lobed surface. It grows in patches on hard substrates up to in diameter and overgrows other organisms. The colour is variable and ranges from orange-brown to tan or beige. This sponge does not contain spicules or spongin to reinforce its body wall and has a simple structure with only two types of cell with inclusions. Distribution and habitat Oscarella carmela is believed to be a native of northern and central Californian marine waters. It was first observed in Monterey Bay Aquarium and several research seawater aquaria in western California. It was later searched for, and eventually found, in the sea on the underside of boulders in rock pools in the high intertidal zone in Carmel Bay. Although it was not described until 2004, it is not believed to be an invasive species in the United States but is more likely to be indigenous and have been overlooked previously because it is uncommon and very similar to more common Halisarca species. It is in fact the only member of its genus Oscarella to be found in the eastern Pacific. It is hypothesized that in the wild it may be limited in its distribution by predation, whereas in the protected environment of an aquarium it grows profusely. Biology Like other sponges, Oscarella carmela is a filter feeder. It creates a current of water through its interior from which it extracts bacteria and planktonic food particles. Reproduction is viviparous and the planktonic larvae are the oval type known as amphiblastulae. This type of larval form is quite common in calcareous sponges but is unusual in other sponge groups. The genome of Oscarella carmela has been sequenced and it is used as a model in evolutionary developmental biology. Analysis of the genome suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and eumetazoan animals (a clade that contains all the higher animals except the sponges and placozoans) was more complex both genetically and morphologically than had previously been thought. The data suggest that homoscleromorph sponges have retained certain features that have been lost in other demosponges.

At the time of adoption, in 1887, he was only six years old, therefore, the Court of Wards along with the Diwani-i-Raj, Ban Bihari Kapoor, (the natural father of Bijaychand), ruled the estate up to 1902. In 1893, the title of 'Raja' was bestowed on Ban Bihari Kapoor. The government permitted the Raj in 1897 to maintain an armed force of 600 people and 41 cannons.Imperial Gazetteer of India by Sir William Wilson Hunter, 1908 ‚Äì Page 101 In 1899, Bijay Chand Mahtab passed the entrance examination of Calcutta University, and was the first in the Raj family to obtain a formal educational qualification. Ruler In 1902, he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers to the throne of Burdwan Raj. Next year in 1903, the title of 'Rajadhiraj' was bestowed on him at the Delhi Durbar. A pompous coronation was organised in the palace at Bardhaman, where Lieutenant Governor Bourdillon was present to bestow the honour. In 1903, he invited the Governor General Lord Curzon to the Bardhaman palace and to commemorate the event constructed a gate now known as Curzon Gate in Gothic style, which is a major landmark of Burdwan today and stands at junction of Bijaychand Road and Grand Trunk Road. The Royal Palace of Burdwan is situated one km from the gate. In 1903, he saved the life of the Lieutenant Governor, Sir Andrew Fraser. He risked his life to save that of Sir Andrew Fraser, lieutenant-governor of Bengal, when an attempt to assassinate him was made by Indian nationalists on 7 November 1908. In return for his loyalty to the British, he was honoured with the title of K.C.I.E. and Indian Order of Merit (Class III).Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (New Series) Table of Contents ‚Äì October 1941 ‚Äì Volume 73, Issue 04 pp: 387‚Äì388 Obituary : Maharaja Adhiraja Bijay Chand Mahatab of Burdwan.

He also served as representative of Bengal zamindars in Legislative and Provincial council, continuously for many years. In 1908, he toured England and Europe and later wrote a book named Diary of an European Tour. He was also noted for his philanthropy, especially in field of education and health welfare. For example, in 1908, he donated Rs. 40,000/- towards construction of hostel and other facilities for Ranchi Arts College, Ranchi, where Burdwan Raj also held large estates.Education and Social Changes in Bihar 1900‚Äì1921: A Survey of Social History by S.

He was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council from 1907 to 1918, and of the Imperial Legislative Council from 1909 to 1912. He was associated with the state administration in subsequent years and Member of Executive Council of Bengal for the years 1919‚Äì1924. He was also the President of British Indian Association from 1911 to 1918 and again in 1925. In 1914, he was appointed as one of the members of the committee that investigated in to riots of Budge Budge and Komagata Maru incident In 1924, he was one of the members of a committee headed by Sir Charles Todhunter, which looked into taxation reforms in British India, which submitted its report in 1925.Taxation and the Indian Economy by S.M. Jha, 1990‚Äì Page 166 and was also the member of Indian Reforms Enquiry Commission of 1924. Official seal of Bijay Chand Mahtab In spite of his loyalty towards the British, he provided warm hospitality to Mahatma Gandhi, when he visited Bardhaman in 1925 and welcomed cordially Subhas Chandra Bose when he visited Bardhaman in 1928 to campaign in the municipal elections. During the later part of his rule, however, there were allegations of financial corruption coupled with mismanagement and the affairs of the Raj were in shambles. The British administrator took over the complete management of Burdwan Raj and Bijoy Chand was deprived of management from the years 1929‚Äì1936. In 1936, he was handed over the reign of his Estate back by British. In 1938, he was a member of the Francis Floud Commission to suggest changes in the Permanent Settlement of 1793. The commission recommended the replacement of the zamindari system by a ryotwari (tenancy) system in which the ownership of land would vest with the ryot (tenant) and the land revenue payable by him could be revised periodically. The recommendations could not be implemented because of differences in the Fazlul Huq ministry. However, with the India's independence gaining momentum it was evident that the days of zemindars and princely states were coming to an end. It was this realisation that led Bijaychand Mahtab to extend indirect support to the Congress. Writer Bijaychand Mahtab was deeply involved with Bengali literature. He was president of the reception committee in the 8th session of the Bangya Sahitya Sammelan held at Bardhaman in 1914. From amongst the twenty books he wrote, mention may be made of Impression, The Indian Horizon, Meditation, Studies, Vijaygitika (collection of songs composed by him), Troyodashi (poem), Ranjit (play), and Manaslila (science-play). Death and successor Mahtab died on 29 August 1941 at Burdwan. His reign which began in 1887 and lasted till 1941, was the longest in history of Bardhaman Raj. He left behind two sons Uday Chand and Abhay Chand and two daughters, thereby ending the long history adoptions for succession in Burdwan Raj. His elder son Uday Chand Mahtab, succeeded him to the throne of Burdwan Raj.

Language users build relationships with their interlocutors by expressing such positions. In other approaches in linguistics (including linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, corpus linguistics), alternative terms such as evaluation or stance are preferred. J.R. Martin and P.R.R. White's approach to appraisal regionalised the concept into three interacting domains: 'attitude', 'engagement' and 'graduation'. Each of these has various sub-systems; for example, 'attitude' includes 'affect' (expression of emotion), 'appreciation' (evaluation of things/entities), and 'judgement' (evaluation of people and their behaviour), with different choices within these sub-systems. In the case of 'affect', for instance, these more delicate choices relate to different types of emotion. However, there is debate about the different sub-systems that should be recognised, and various researchers have since suggested modifications of the initial description. The analysis of appraisal has also become influential outside Systemic Functional Linguistics, in various types of discourse analysis.

He was a regular member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and a member of several European learned societies. The main area of scientific research of Vladimir Petkovic was Serbian medieval art, especially fresco painting. In Serbian historiography, he laid the foundations for the scientific study of monumental heritage. He gained his knowledge during his extensive fieldwork, after which he published numerous articles and monographic studies on Serbian medieval monasteries, churches, and paintings. He published well-known collections of material on medieval frescoes in Serbia and Macedonia, and his review of church monuments is particularly significant. He wrote about the stylistic characteristics of painting, especially iconography when he noticed the existence of special schools in Serbian medieval painting. He was also the first to pay attention to the importance of late medieval monuments - the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, part of which he published. He worked as an archeologist in Stoby and the Empress City.

Amateur career As an amateur Siddique was a 5-time Yorkshire Champion, 2x English Champion, England Schoolboy Captain and National Schoolboy Champion. Professional career He made his boxing debut in 2002, and competed at both light-welterweight, and welterweight where he went on to win the BBBofC Central Area welterweight title by way of 4th round TKO. He was also British Masters Champion. Siddique prepared for a fight against undefeated Julius Odion, however the fight was cancelled. His first loss came on his 22nd fight at the hands of then undefeated champion Martin Gethin. He came back to fight after a year off boxing for his 23rd fight against Tom Glover, an opponent he had previously defeated. Siddique was disqualified due to continuous low-blows and subsequently put boxing on hold due to a back injury.

This image does not depict the stellation, because different visible parts of a single hexagonal face of the stellation have different colors. However, the coloring is consistent with a depiction of the polyhedral compound of three flattened octahedra. Escher's solid is topologically equivalent to the disdyakis dodecahedron, a Catalan solid, which can be seen as a rhombic dodecahedron with shorter rhombic pyramids augumented to each face. In geometry, the first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron is a self- intersecting polyhedron with 12 faces, each of which is a non-convex hexagon. It is a stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron and has the same outer shell and the same visual appearance as two other shapes: a solid, Escher's solid, with 48 triangular faces, and a polyhedral compound of three flattened octahedra with 24 overlapping triangular faces. Escher's solid can tessellate space to form the stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb.  Stellation, solid, and compound The first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is a non-convex hexagon. It is a stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron, meaning that each of its faces lies in the same plane as one of the rhombus faces of the rhombic dodecahedron, with each face containing the rhombus in the same plane, and that it has the same symmetries as the rhombic dodecahedron. It is the first stellation, meaning that no other self-intersecting polyhedron with the same face planes and the same symmetries has smaller faces. Extending the faces outwards even farther in the same planes leads to two more stellations, if the faces are required to be simple polygons. For polyhedra formed only using faces in the same 12 planes and with the same symmetries, but with the faces allowed to become non-simple or with multiple faces in a single plane, additional possibilities arise. In particular, removing the inner rhombus from each hexagonal face of the stellation leaves four triangles, and the resulting system of 48 triangles forms a different non-convex polyhedron without self-intersections that forms the boundary of a solid shape, sometimes called Escher's solid. This shape appears in M. C. Escher's works Waterfall and in a study for Stars (although Stars itself features a different shape, the compound of three octahedra). As the stellation and the solid have the same visual appearance, it is not possible to determine which of the two Escher intended to depict in Waterfall. In Study for Stars, Escher depicts the polyhedron in a skeletal form, and includes edges that are part of the skeletal form of Escher's solid but are not part of the stellation. (In the stellation, these line segments are formed by crossings of faces rather than edges.) However, an alternative interpretation for the same skeletal form is that it depicts a third shape with a similar appearance, the polyhedral compound of three flattened octahedra with 24 overlapping triangular faces. The 48 triangular faces of the solid are isosceles; if the longest edge of these triangles is length s then the other two are \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}s, the surface area of the solid is 12\\\\sqrt{2}s^2 and the volume of the solid is 4s^3. Vertices, edges, and faces The vertices of the first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron include the 12 vertices of the cuboctahedron, together with eight additional vertices (the degree-3 vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron). Escher's solid has six additional vertices, at the center points of the square faces of the cuboctahedron (the degree-4 vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron). In the first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron, these six points are not vertices, but are instead the midpoints of pairs of edges that cross at right angles at these points. The first stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron has 12 hexagonal faces, 36 edges, and 20 vertices, yielding an Euler characteristic of 20 ‚àí 36 + 12 = ‚àí4. Escher's solid instead has 48 triangular faces, 72 edges, and 26 vertices, yielding an Euler characteristic of 26 ‚àí 72 + 48 = 2. Tessellation Escher's solid can tessellate space in the stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. Six solids meet at each vertex. This honeycomb is cell-transitive, edge-transitive and vertex-transitive. Tesselation of space with Escher's solids The Yoshimoto Cube, a dissection puzzle between a cube and two copies of Escher's solid, is closely related to this tessellation.

The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Gad, Joely Richardson, and Pink with supporting roles from Patrick Fugit, Carol Kane, Michaela Watkins, Emily Meade and Isiah Whitlock, Jr. The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews, and was released in the United States a year later. Plot Set in New York City, Thanks for Sharing centers around three people undergoing a 12-step process to recover from their sexual addiction. Adam (Mark Ruffalo) walks along the streets of New York, tempted to have sex by various advertisements and women on his way to work. Neil (Josh Gad), a doctor who is addicted to sex and masturbation, purposely grinds against a stranger in a train on the way to attend a sex addiction meeting. Mike (Tim Robbins) is a married recovering sex addict who leads the group. He sponsors Adam, who has not had sex in five years. Adam sponsors Neil. They are all at the sex addiction meeting, talking about their progress. Adam proclaims he's been 'sober' for five years, while Neil cracks jokes and admits he is only there because the court has forced him to. He goes back to masturbating the same night, and lies about being one month sober to the addiction group. Adam meets Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow) at a 'bug party' and they go out on a date. She reveals that she is a breast cancer survivor and that her ex-boyfriend is an alcoholic; he does not tell her about his own addiction for fear that she will reject him. They begin a relationship. Dede (Alecia Moore) joins the sex addiction meetings, and reveals at her first meeting that she has been addicted to sex since she was a young girl. Neil, a doctor, is caught secretly filming under the skirt of his boss, and is fired. He then begins to take the meetings more seriously, and admits he has a problem. Meanwhile, Mike's son Danny (Patrick Fugit), a recovering drug addict, has returned home and is attempting to make amends to Mike and his mother Katie (Joely Richardson). Phoebe eventually finds out about Adam's sex addiction when finding an addiction token in his pocket the morning after sleeping with him. She takes some time away from him, but eventually agrees to continue their relationship. Neil talks Dede out of having sex with her abusive ex- boyfriend, and they go to a dance together. They come close to kissing, but don't. Mike and Danny get into a fight when Mike assumes Danny stole his mother's pills. Danny reveals that Mike gave Katie Hepatitis C, and confronts him about hitting him when he was a child. Mike slaps Danny, who attacks Mike and knocks Katie over; upon realizing what he has done, Danny panics and runs out of the house. Phoebe has become frustrated with Adam's reticence to be physical with her, and breaks it off after they have a fight. Adam sleeps with a prostitute. Dede comes over to Neil's place, and helps him clean up his house and burns his porn. She admits she's never been 'just friends' with a man before. Mike finds Katie's pills, and realizes Danny didn't steal them after all. Katie tells Mike off for \\"always having to be right\\", and Mike goes to find Danny. While he is out, Katie calls him to tell him Danny is in the hospital after a DUI. Mike hugs his son in the hospital, who turns out to have been sober for the past eight months. Adam invites his ex-girlfriend Becky (Emily Meade) over, and as they start out by reenacting her father issues, she then wants Adam to slap her. When he refuses, she breaks down, locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide. Neil takes the train to get over to Adam's and breaks down his bathroom door to rescue Becky. Adam gets sober and goes back to Phoebe, who admits she too is not perfect. Neil confronts his inappropriately sexual mother, Roberta (Carol Kane), and all the addicts celebrate their sobriety.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a positive score of 51% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 5.59/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Thanks For Sharing showcases some fine performances but doesn't delve into its thorny premise as deeply as it should\\". Metacritic reports a score of 54 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Richard Roeper gave the movie a largely positive review, saying \\"First-time director Blumberg does a fine job and makes some brave choices.\\" Laremy Legel of Film.com was among the most critical, giving the film a D+, and commenting that it \\"can't quite find its footing as either a drama or a comedy, and near the end it's actively sliding off the rails\\".

More specifically, they are distinguished by their tetracyclic cyclopentanophenanthrene backbone that marks their close relationship with sterols. They fall in two major categories: Solanum alkaloids and Veratrum alkaloids. A Steroidal alkaloid has also been found in Chonemorpha fragrans (Frangipani vine), 'chonemorphine' was used to treat intestinal infections in Wistar rats. (Chatterjee DK et al (1987) Parasitol Res 74, 1, 30-33).Wiart Christophe  Solanum alkaloids  These compounds generally appear as their corresponding glycoside in plants of the genus Solanum. Solanum includes plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and various nightshades Starting with cholesterol, the biosynthesis of these compounds follow a similar general mechanism including hyroxylation, oxidation, and transamination before differentiating. Alkaloids found in these plants include chaconine, solanine, solasodine, tomatidine, tomatine, and solanidine. Typically they are used in plants as a protection mechanism against animals. Due to the typical anti-cholinesterase activity, they can be used as poisons against the plants' predators. They can be used as starting materials for steroidal drugs. There are various tests for identifying these alkaloids. The characteristic test involves dissolving the compound in hot amyl alcohol or ethanol and watching for the formation of a jelly-like product as the mixture cools.  Veratrum alkaloids  True to their name, Veratrum alkaloids come from plants of the genus Veratrum. Alkaloids are found in the roots and rhizomes of these plants. They include veratridine, cyclopamine, and jervine. Because of their actions on the cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and respiratory systems, Veratrum alkaloids have been used for the treatment of various conditions like myasthenia gravis, hypotension, and eclampsia.  Bioactivity  Steroidal alkaloids have been investigated for a wide range of potential bioactivities including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-estrogenic, and chemotherapeutic activity. These bioactivities are the result of a wide array of mechanisms across different compounds. For example, solasodine antimicrobial bioactivity is accomplished by interfering with the synthesis of genetic substances in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Prototheca wickerhamii. Solasodine inhibits growth signaling in Geim original algal. On the other hand, tomatidine synergistically works with aminoglycosides as antibiotics against S. aureus. Antiinflammation is similarly accomplished with a variety of mechanisms. Solasodine, for example, reduces interleukin-2 and -8 production whereas tomatidine inhibits specific nuclear translocation, JNK activation, as well as induce nitrous oxide synthase. Lastly, nine steroidal alkaloids have significant antiestrogenic activity whereas seven inhibit estrone sulfatase. However, in addition to their therapeutic benefits, steroidal alkaloids, specifically veratrum alkaloids, are potentially deadly. Veratrum alkaloid compounds act by attaching to voltage-gated sodium ion channels, altering their permeability. Veratrum alkaloids cause affected sodium channels to reactivate 1000x slower than unaffected channels. Furthermore, veratrum alkaloids block inactivation of sodium channels and lower their activation threshold so they remain open even at resting potential. As a result, sodium concentrations within the cell rise, leading to increased nerve and muscle excitability. These biochemical channels cause muscle contractions, repetitive firing of the nerves and an irregular heart rhythm caused by stimulation of vagal nerves which control the parasympathetic functions of the heart, lungs and digestive tract.

The paper operated out of a small office next to the Criterion Hotel in Goulburn Street, Crookwell, with the business registered as The Argyle Liberal printing works. The Liberal's stated editorial policy indicated it was to be a \\"free and independent journal in the interests of producers ... touching pastoral, agricultural, mining and social matters\\". By 1907, between 400 and 500 copies of each issue were being published: a significant circulation for a country newspaper of the time.Walker, R.B. (1976) The Newspaper Press in New South Wales, 1803-1920. Sydney University Press, p.177. It continued for a further 23 years, with publication having ceased by October 1930, primarily as a result of the Great Depression in Australia. The Editors The first proprietors of the Argyle Liberal were William James Smith and Laurence Patrick Francis Gilmartin. Laurence (also known as Patrick) Gilmartin was a staunch supporter of the labour movement. He was selected as candidate and representative for the NSW Political Labour League in 1907, and in the same year took over from partner WJ Smith as sole operator of the Liberal.\\"First Paper ‚Äì 1885\\" (12 March 1986).

On 18 October 1909, Gilmartin fell victim to a violent assault near his home in Crookwell, and subsequently died of complications from the injuries he received. Originally charged with Gilmartin's murder, his assailant, Christopher Stephenson, was convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter Gilmartin was buried in Crookwell's Roman Catholic Cemetery after a funeral which drew a cortege of \\"over a mile of vehicles following the body to the graveside\\" and during which \\"all the business houses closed from 11 to 12 o'clock\\". Following Gilmartin's death, his mother, Mary Ann, took over operation of The Argyle Liberal.\\"First Paper ‚Äì 1885\\" (12 March 1986). Goulburn Post, p.13. She remained as editor and proprietor for 18 years, until January 1927, when she relinquished control to Mr WJ Morton due to ill health. Mary Ann died on 3 October 1927, aged 72. In early 1930, The Liberal was being produced for Morton by AJ Lucas, however publication ceased entirely sometime between March and October of that year.

Published in Barcelona between 1902 and 1912, it followed the political line marked by Francesc Camb√≥'s Lliga Regionalista. History ¬°Cu-cut!, named after the cuckoo bird (), was first published on 2 January 1902 and, like El Be Negre magazine that would be published later, it steadfastly opposed Lerrouxism in Spain. Its director was Manuel Folch i Torres and most articles were written by Josep Morat√≥ i Grau, Eduard Coca i Vallmajor and Manuel Urgell√®s, among others such as Josep Abril i Virgili and Vicen√ß Cald√©s i Ar√∫s. The main illustrators were Joan Llaverias, Joan Junceda, Ricard Opisso, Feliu Elias, nicknamed Apa, Llu√≠s Bagaria, and Lola Anglada.

The price was ten c√®ntims. The literary director was Manuel Folch i Torres, the art director Gaiet√† Cornet i Palau and the managing director Ramon Pruna, who became a kind of scapegoat for the successive judiciary cases against the magazine and was imprisoned more than once. On 23 November 1905 the magazine published a caricature by Joan Junceda ridiculing the military. Following this, about 300 officers of the Spanish Army, angry at the magazine for having published the offending cartoon, stormed the Cu-Cut! offices, which were also the offices of En Patufet and La Veu de Catalunya. They caused much destruction in the building, burning the place before leaving.Jaume Capdevila, ¬´El efecto mariposa¬ª.

Even then, it was forced to close down in 1912 by the leaders of the Lliga Regionalista, sore at the satirical cover by Joan Llaverias on the 25 April 1912 issue.

It is owned and operated by Taipower. History In the early 1970s, the Atomic Energy Council formed a task group to search for sites as a temporary storage facility for mid and low-level nuclear waste. The decision to choose Long Men area of Lanyu Island as the storage site was made in 1974. The construction of the facility commenced by building a harbor in 1978 and later the storage in 1980. First shipment carrying nuclear waste arrived in May 1982. Aborigines living on the island have been protesting on the facility. Location The facility was built at the South Eastern tip of Lanyu Island. It faces the Pacific Ocean in one direction, and the other three directions face hills behind it, thus separating the facility from the residence by natural barriers. Functions The facility receives low-level radioactive solid waste from nuclear power plants, medical, agriculture, industrial, education and research sectors about 45,000 barrels annually, which is being shipped by boat from Taiwan Island every week. Safety Taipower claims that several safety measures are taken to ensure the safety of the facility. Wastes are tested and examined before being stored at the facility, transportation and storage are done under strict control, thorough investigation and examination are done to the environment surrounding the facility, and changes in the radioactivity level are strictly monitored.

Most of the area is occupied by two-story 19th and 20th century manufacturing lofts and industrial buildings which were once predominantly occupied by meat packers and butchers, but which now house restaurants, boutiques and high-end retailers. The clients and architects wanted the hotel to \\"reflect the historic feel of the neighborhood.\\" Josephine Minutillo, a critic for Architectural Record noted, \\"the Standard is sleek and gritty at the same time, echoing its Meatpacking District neighborhood, where high-end fashion showrooms and pricey art galleries have supplanted bloody butcher shops and no-frills warehouses.\\"  Design  Room in the hotel. The hotel is raised above street level on pilotis, five massive sculptural piers, which hoist the building thirty feet over the park below. On the east side of the structure \\"[a] single, sloped concrete pier, along which a tantalizing set of fire stairs runs, supports the building by the hotel entrance.\\" The elevation of this structure is one clear distinction from the orthogonal street grid of Manhattan. Another was hinging the two concrete slabs which make up the structure. The hinge technique was not only a stylistic choice but also a functional one. Because of the angle of the two slabs all 337 guest rooms have unobstructed views of Manhattan: the New York City skyline, the Hudson River or the Empire State Building. Balazs explains the choice for hinging the slabs as such: \\"It [allowed] us to squeeze in an extra room per floor, but more significantly, it provides a variety of view corridors while retaining as many views as possible of the Empire State Building.\\" The two prevalent materials used were concrete and glass. Two techniques of concrete pouring were used, pour-in-place and board form. The grid of the concrete serves as a frame for the water-white glass. The combination of the two materials creates a curtain wall for the fa√ßade of the structure. Architype Review notes that, \\"the juxtaposition of the building‚Äôs two materials‚Ä¶reflects the character of New York City: the gritty quality of the concrete contrasts with the refinement of the glass.\\" View of the hotel from the southwest  Architectural style  The style of the building is best related to the architectural vocabulary defined by Le Corbusier. There are numerous references to his style of building, from the use of the pilotis, to the incorporation of public space, the use of a glass curtain wall fa√ßade, and the utilization of the rooftop, which now houses a bar called Le Bain.Rooftop Drinker. Le Bain. Accessed July 29, 2013. These features also speak to the principles of the International Style. Joseph Minutillo notes that some of the references to Corbusier were intentional, while others may not have been. For example, \\"an elevated pedestrian zone slicing through the building [is] reminiscent of Le Corbusier‚Äôs multistreet-level designs for La Ville Radieuse.\\"  Ground-level public plazas  One of the client's objectives was to \\"create a living room for the neighborhood,\\" essentially to create a space where local members of the community as well as hotel guests could gather, and co-mingle. To this end, the street level of the Standard is an expansive outdoor plaza where guests of the hotel as well as the general public can sit and enjoy food from the Standard‚Äôs restaurant, The Standard Grill, or beer from The Standards Biergarten. The outdoor plaza is situated partly underneath the Highline, so the preexisting railroad tracks lie overhead. Because of the exposed elevated railroad tracks and the client‚Äôs stress on keeping with the historical feel of the Meatpacking District, numerous stylistic and design features were implemented. The fa√ßade of the entire restaurant is composed of reclaimed brick, very similar to the style of brick found in most other areas in the neighborhood. The architects also decided to hang metal canopies and use steel frame windows; these two architectural forms are commonly seen at meatpacking plants and other warehouses in this area. These stylistic choices allow this newly constructed building to keep with the historical feel of the Meatpacking District.  Elevator incident  On May 12, 2014, video footage was broadcast by the TMZ television program of Solange Knowles, sister of Beyonc√©, physically assaulting her brother-in-law, hip-hop mogul Jay-Z in an elevator in the hotel. The video spread quickly across the Internet and became an Internet meme.

Early in his career he worked as cantor in villages and cities in Russia such as Vilna and Odessa. In 1921 he immigrated to the United States and eventually joined the Congregation Shaare Zedek. Renowned for his lyric tenor compositional recordings and cantorial recitatives, Roitman became known as \\"the poet of the pulpit\\". Biography Roitman was born to Mordecai and Mariom Roitman on November 1, 1884 at the Jusefpol village in the Russian province of Podolia. At the age of 12, he became the choral assistant to a cantor at the nearby town Lidvinke. He was then apprenticed to a series of cantors starting with Yankel Sorover and including Zeidel Rovner. Roitman would remain with Rovner throughout his teenage years. He studied music at Yeshiva College and continued his studies as a post-graduate at the Leningrad Conservatory. Roitman worked as a cantor for five years at the Jewish Temple of Elisavetgrad, starting in 1904. From 1909 to 1912, he worked as cantor at Vilna. He became the chief cantor at the Ginsbourgh Synagogue in Leningrad starting in 1912, until the October Revolution of 1917 destroyed that congregation. During a 1918 pogrom, Roitman fled from Elisavetgrad to Odessa and there organized the Hebrew Music School, which the government would soon dissolve. Roitman lived in Kishinev, Moldova around the year 1920, making concert tours throughout Romania. Roitman emigrated to the United States in 1921 and spent two years with the Congregation Ohev Shalom in Brooklyn. In 1924 he joined the Congregation Shaare Zedek in Manhattan, with which he would officiate until his death. During this time, he made concert tours in Europe and South America. After a long illness, Roitman died in New York City on April 4, 1943. Musical career \\"Ashamnu Mikol Am,\\" composed by David Roitman. Roitman's voice was a lyric tenor, mellow in quality. He used mezza voce with a highly developed coloratura and falsetto. Roitman's renditions are noted for their clarity and improvisational simplicity. His style used a canonized system of practice and refinement known as nusa·∏• hat'filla. Roitman's earlier compositions reflected the sad fate of his people, while his later work emphasized a more dramatic and prophetic idiom. He made records while at Leningrad and Vilna, most of which remained unknown to the United States until archival releases in the 1970s. His only published composition during his lifetime was \\"Rachel Mevakkah Al Baneha\\" [Rachel Weeping for Her Children], which he wrote in Odessa. An unattributed recording by Yossele Rosenblatt made the composition popular in the United States even before Roitman immigrated there. Roitman's compositions \\"Ashamnu Mikol Am\\" and \\"Cantorial Anthology 2\\" also achieved widespread popularity during his lifetime.

The fis (commonly translated as \\"tribe\\", also as \\"clan\\" or \\"kin\\" community) stands at the center of Albanian organization based on kinship relations, a concept which can be found among southern Albanians also with the term far√´. Inherited from ancient Illyrian social structures, Albanian tribal society emerged in the early Middle Ages as the dominant form of social organization among Albanians. The development of feudalism came to both antagonize it, but also slowly integrate aspects of it in Albanian feudal society as most noble families themselves came from these tribes and depended on their support. This process stopped after the Ottoman conquest of Albania and the Balkans in the late 15th century and was followed by a process of strengthening of the tribe (fis) as a means of organization against Ottoman centralization particularly in the mountains of northern Albania and adjacent areas of Montenegro. It also remained in a less developed system in southern Albania where large feudal estates and later trade and urban centres began to develop at the expense of tribal organization. One of the most particular elements of the Albanian tribal structure is its dependence on the Kanun, a code of Albanian oral customary laws. Most tribes engaged in warfare against external forces like the Ottoman Empire. Some also engaged in limited inter- tribal struggle for the control of resources. Until the early years of the 20th century, the Albanian tribal society remained largely intact until the rise to power of communist regime in 1944, and is considered as the only example of a tribal social system structured with tribal chiefs and councils, blood feuds and oral customary laws, surviving in Europe until the middle of the 20th century.  Terminology  Fundamental terms that define Albanian tribal structure are shared by all regions. Some terms may be used interchangeably with the same semantic content and other terms have a different content depending on the region. No uniform or standard classification exists as societal structure showed variance even within the same general area. The term fis is the central concept of Albanian tribal structure. The fis is a community whose members are linked to each other as kin through the same patrilineal ancestry and live in the same territory. It has been translated in English as tribe or clan. Thus, fis refers both to the kinship ties that bond the community and the territorialization of that community in a region exclusively used in a communal manner by the members of the fis. In contrast, bashk√´si (literally, association) refers to a community of the same ancestry which has not been established territorially in a given area which is considered its traditional home region. It is further divided into fis i madh and fis i vog√´l. Fis i madh refers to all members of the kin community that live in its traditional territory, while fis i vog√´l refers to the immediate family members and their cousins (kush√´ri). In this sense, it is sometimes used synonymously with v√´llaz√´ri or vllazni in Geg Albanian. This term refers to all families that trace their origin to the same patrilineal ancestor. Related families (familje) are referred to as of one bark/pl. barqe (literally, belly). As some tribes grew in number, a part of them settled in new territory and formed a new fis that may or may not have held the same name as the parental group. The concept of farefisni refers to the bonds between all communities that stem from the same fis. Far√´ literally means seed. Among southern Albanians, it is sometimes used as a synonym for fis, which in turn is used in the meaning of fis i vog√´l. The term bajrak refers to an Ottoman military institution of the 17th century. In international bibliography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was often mistakengly equated with the fis as both would sometimes cover the same geographical area. The result of this mistake was the portrayal of bajrak administrative divisions and other regions as fis in early anthropological accounts of Albania, although there were bajraks in which only a small part or none at all constituted a fis.  Overview  Shkreli tribesmen. Photo taken by William Le Queux before 1906. The northern Albanian tribes are fiercely proud of the fact that they have never been completely conquered by external powers, in particular by the Ottoman Empire. This fact is raised on the level of historical and heritage orthodoxy among the members of the tribes. In the 18th century the Ottomans instituted the system of bajrak military organization in northern Albania and Kosovo. From the Ottoman perspective, the institution of the bajrak had multiple benefits. Although it recognized a semi-autonomous status in communities like Hoti, it could also be used to stabilize the borderlands as these communities in their new capacity would defend the borders of the empire, as they saw in them the borders of their own territory. Furthermore, the Ottomans considered the office of head bajraktar as a means that in times of rebellion could be used to divide and conquer the tribes by handing out privileges to a select few. On the other hand, autonomy of the borderlands was also a source of conflict as the tribes tried to increase their autonomy and minimize involvement of the Ottoman state. Through a circular series of events of conflict and renegotiation a state of balance was found between Ottoman centralization and tribal autonomy. Hence, the Ottoman era is marked by both continuous conflict and a formalization of socio-economic status within Ottoman administration. Members of the tribes of northern Albania believe their history is based on the notions of resistance and isolationism. Some scholars connect this belief with the concept of \\"negotiated peripherality\\". Throughout history the territory northern Albanian tribes occupy has been contested and peripheral so northern Albanian tribes often exploited their position and negotiated their peripherality in profitable ways. This peripheral position also affected their national program which significance and challenges are different from those in southern Albania. Such peripheral territories are zones of dynamic culture creation where it is possible to create and manipulate regional and national histories to the advantage of certain individuals and groups. An important institution within the social system of the Albanian tribesmen is Besa, usually translated as \\"faith\\", that means \\"to keep the promise\\" and \\"word of honor\\", a concept included in the Kanun, a collection of Albanian traditional customs and cultural practices. Besa is an important part of personal and familial standing and is often used as an example of \\"Albanianism\\". Someone who breaks his besa may even be banished from his community.  Organisation  Northern Albanians Shoshi by Edith Durham. Among Gheg Mal√´sors (highlanders) the fis (clan), is headed by the oldest male (kryeplak) and formed the basic unit of tribal society. The governing councils consist of elders (pleknit, singular: plak). The idea of law administration is so closely related to the \\"old age\\", that \\"to arbitrate\\" is me pleknue, and plekn√≠ means both \\"seniority\\" and \\"arbitration\\". The fis is divided into a group of closely related houses called mehala, and the house (shpi). The head of mehala is the krye (lit. \\"head\\"), while the head of the house is the zoti i shpis (\\"the lord of the house\\"). A house may be composed by two or three other houses with property in common under one zot. A political and territorial unit consisting of several clans was the bajrak (standard, banner). The leader of a bajrak, whose position was hereditary, was referred to as bajraktar (standard bearer). Several bajraks composed a tribe, which was led by a man from a notable family, while major issues were decided by the tribe assembly whose members were male members of the tribe. The Ottomans implemented the bayraktar system within northern Albanian tribes, and granted some privileges to the bayraktars (banner chieftains) in exchange for their obligation to mobilize local fighters to support military actions of the Ottoman forces. Those privileges also entailed Albanian tribesmen to pay no taxes and were excluded from military conscription in return for military service as irregular troops however few served in that capacity. Malisors viewed Ottoman officials as a threat to their tribal way of living and left it to their bajraktars to deal with the Ottoman political system. Officials of the late Ottoman period noted that Malisors preferred their children learn use of a weapon and refused to send them to government schools that taught Turkish which were viewed as forms of state control. Most Albanian Malisors were illiterate. Southern Albanians In southern Albania, the social system is based on the house (shpi or sht√´pi) and the fis, consisting of a patrilineal kinship group and an exogamous unit composed by members with some property in common. The patrilineal kinship ties are defined by the concept of \\"blood\\" (gjak) also implying physical and moral characteristics, which are shared by all the members of a fis. The fis generally consists of three or four related generations, meaning that they have a common ancestor three or four generations ago, while the tribe is called fara or gjeri, which is much smaller than a northern Albanian fis. The members of a fara know that they have a common ancestor who is the eponymos founder of the village. The political organization is communal, that is, every neighbourhood send a representing elder (plak), to the governing council of the village (pleq√´si), who elect the head of the village (kryeplak).  Culture  Autonomy, Kanun and Gjakmarrja Malisor society used tribal law and participated in the custom of bloodfeuding. Ottoman control mainly existed in the few urban centres and valleys of northern Albania and was minimal to almost non-existent in the mountains, where Malisors lived an autonomous existence according to kanun (tribal law) of Lek Dukagjini. At the same time Western Kosovo was also an area where Ottoman rule among highlanders was minimal to non-existent and government officials would ally themselves with local power holders to exert any form of authority. Western Kosovo was dominated by the Albanian tribal system where Kosovar Malisors settled disputes among themselves through their mountain law. In period without stable state control the tribe trialed its members. The usual punishments were fines, exile or disarmament. The house of the exiled member of the tribe would be burned. Disarmament was regarded as the most embarrassing verdict. Shala men. Photo taken by Edith Durham before 1909. The Law of Lek Dukagjini (kanun) was named after a medieval prince Lek√´ Dukagjini from the fifteenth century who ruled in northern Albania and codified the customary laws of the highlands. Albanian tribes from the Dibra region governed themselves according to the Law of Skanderbeg (kanun), named after a fifteenth century warrior who fought the Ottomans. Disputes would be solved through tribal law within the framework of vendetta or blood feuding and the activity was widespread among the Malisors. In situations of murder tribal law stipulated the principle of koka p√´r kok√´ (head for a head) where relatives of the victim are obliged to seek gjakmarrja (blood vengeance). Nineteen percent of male deaths in ƒ∞≈ükodra vilayet and 600 fatalities per year in Western Kosovo were from murders caused by vendetta and blood feuding during the late Ottoman period. Besa Besa is a word in the Albanian language meaning \\"pledge of honour. The besa was an important institution within the tribal society of the Albanian Malisors. Albanian tribes swore oaths to jointly fight against the government and in this aspect the besa served to uphold tribal autonomy. The besa was used toward regulating tribal affairs both between and within tribes. The Ottoman government used the besa as a way to co-opt Albanian tribes in supporting state policies or to seal agreements. During the Ottoman period, the besa would be cited in government reports regarding Albanian unrest, especially in relation to the tribes. The besa formed a central place within Albanian society in relation to generating military and political power. Besas held Albanians together, united them and would wane when the will to enforce them dissipated. In times of revolt against the Ottomans by Albanians, the besa functioned as a link among different groups and tribes.  Geography  The Malisors lived in three geographical regions within northern Albania. Mal√´sia e Madhe (great highlands) contained five large tribes with four (Hoti, Kelmendi, Shkreli, Kastrati) having a Catholic majority and Muslim minority with Gruda evenly split between both religions. Within Mal√´sia e Madhe there were an additional seven small tribes. During times of war and mobilisation of troops, the bajraktar (chieftain) of Hoti was recognised by the Ottoman government as leader of all forces of the Mal√´sia e Madhe tribes having collectively some 6,200 rifles. Mal√´sia e Vog√´l (small highlands) with seven Catholic tribes such as the Shala with 4 bajaraktars, Shoshi, Toplana and Nikaj containing some 1,250 households with a collective strength of 2,500 men that could be mobilised for war. Shoshi had a distinction in the region of possessing a legendary rock associated with Lek√´ Dukagjini. The Mirdita region which was also a large powerful devoutly Catholic tribe with 2,500 households and five bajraktars that could mobilize 5,000 irregular troops. A general assembly of the Mirdita met often in Orosh to deliberate on important issues relating to the tribe. The position of hereditary prince of the tribe with the title Prenk Pasha (Prince Lord) was held by the Gjonmarkaj family. Apart from the princely family the Franciscan Abbot held some influence among the Mirdita tribesmen. The government estimated the military strength of Malisors in ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak as numbering over 30,000 tribesmen and Ottoman officials were of the view that the highlanders could defeat Montenegro on their own with limited state assistance. In Western Kosovo, the Gjakov√´ highlands contained eight tribes that were mainly Muslim and in the Luma area near Prizren there were five tribes, mostly Muslim. Other important tribal groupings further south include the highlanders of the Dibra region known as the \\"Tigers of Dibra\\". Among the many religiously mixed Catholic-Muslim tribes and one Muslim-Orthodox clan, Ottoman officials noted that tribal loyalties superseded religious affiliations. In Catholic households there were instances of Christians who possessed four wives, marrying the first spouse in a church and the other three in the presence of an imam, while among Muslim households the Islamic tradition of circumcision was ignored.  History  Late Ottoman period During the Great Eastern Crisis, Prenk Bib Doda, hereditary chieftain of Mirdita initiated a rebellion in mid-April 1877 against government control and the Ottoman Empire sent troops to put it down. Montenegro attempted to gain support from among the Malisors even though it lacked religious or ethnic links with the Albanian tribesmen. Amidst the Eastern Crisis and subsequent border negotiations Italy suggested in April 1880 for the Ottoman Empire to give Montenegro the Tuz district containing mainly Catholic Gruda and Hoti populations which would have left the tribes split between both countries. With Hoti this would have left an additional problem of tensions and instability due to the tribe having precedence by tradition over the other four tribes during peace and war. The tribes affected by the negotiations swore a besa (pledge) to resist any reduction of their lands and sent telegrams to surrounding regions for military assistance. During the late Ottoman period Ghegs often lacked education and integration within the Ottoman system, while they had autonomy and military capabilities. Those factors gave the area of Geg√´nia an importance within the empire that differed from Tosk√´ria. Still many Ottoman officers thought that Ghegs, in particular the highlanders were often a liability instead of an asset for the state being commonly referred to as \\"wild\\" () or a backward people that lived in poverty and ignorance for 500 years being hostile to civilisation and progress. In areas of Albania were Malisors lived, the empire only posted Ottoman officers who had prior experience of service in other tribal regions of the state like Kurdistan or Yemen that could bridge cultural divides with Gheg tribesmen. Albanian Malisors in an early 20th postcard. Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Ottoman officials posted to Albanian populated lands and some Albanians strongly disproved of blood feuding viewing it as inhumane, uncivilised and an unnecessary waste of life that created social disruption, lawlessness and economic dislocation. To resolve disputes and clamp down on the practice the Ottoman state addressed the problem directly by sending Blood Feud Reconciliation Commissions (musalaha-ƒ± dem komisyonlarƒ±) that produced results with limited success. In the late Ottoman period, due to the influence of Catholic Franciscan priests some changes to blood feuding practices occurred among Albanian highlanders such as guilt being restricted to the offender or their household and even one tribe accepting the razing of the offender's home as compensation for the offense. Ottoman officials were of the view that violence committed by Malisors in the 1880s-1890s was of a tribal nature not related to nationalism or religion. They also noted that Albanian tribesmen who identified with Islam did so in name only and lacked knowledge of the religion. Shkreli tribe at the feast of Saint Nicholas at Bzheta in Shkreli territory, 1908. In the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 the new Young Turk government established the Commissions for the Reconciliation of Blood Feuds that focused on the regions such as ƒ∞pek (Pej√´) and Prizren. The commissions sentenced Albanians who had participated in blood feud killing and the Council of Ministers allowed them to continue their work in the provinces until May 1909. After the Young Turk Revolution and subsequent restoration of the Ottoman constitution, the Hoti, Shala, Shoshi and Kastati tribes made a besa (pledge) to support the document and to stop blood feuding with other tribes until November 6, 1908. The Albanian tribes showing sentiments of enthusiasm however had little knowledge of what the constitution would do for them. During the Albanian revolt of 1910, Malisors such as the Shala tribe fought against Ottoman troops that were sent to quell the uprising, disarm the population by collecting guns, and replace the Law of Lek with state courts and laws. Malisors instead planned further resistance and Albanian tribes living near the border fled into Montenegro while negotiating terms with the Ottomans for their return. The Ottoman commander Mahmud Shevket involved in military operations concluded that the bajraktars had become Albanian nationalists and posed a danger to the empire when compared to previous uprisings. The Albanian revolt of 1911 was begun during March by Catholic Albanian tribesmen after they returned from exile in Montenegro. The Ottoman government sent 8,000 troops to quell the uprising and ordered that tribal chieftains would need to stand trial for leading the rebellion. During the revolt, Terenzio Tocci, an Italo-Albanian lawyer gathered the Mirdit√´ chieftains on 26/27 April 1911 in Orosh and proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania and declared a provisional government. After Ottoman troops entered the area to put down the rebellion, Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. On 23 June 1911 Albanian Malisors and other revolutionaries gathered in Montenegro and drafted the Gre√ß√´ Memorandum demanding Albanian sociopolitical and linguistic rights with signatories being from the Hoti, Gruda, Shkreli, Kelmendi and Kastrati tribes. In later negotiations with the Ottomans, an amnesty was granted to the tribesmen with promises by the government to build roads and schools in tribal areas, pay wages of teachers, limit military service to the Istanbul and Shkod√´r areas, right to carry weapons in the countryside but not in urban areas, the appointment of bajraktars relatives to certain administrative positions and compensate Malisors with money and food arriving back from Montenegro. The final agreement was signed in Podgorica by both the Ottomans and Malisors during August 1912 and the highlanders had managed to thwart the centralist tendencies of the Young Turk government in relation to their interests. Independent Albania The last tribal system of Europe located in northern Albania stayed intact until 1944 when Albanian communists seized power and ruled the country for half a century. During that time the tribal system was weakened and eradicated by the communists. After the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, northern Albania underwent demographic changes in areas associated with the tribes becoming in many instances depopulated. Much of the population seeking a better life has moved either abroad or to Albanian cities such as Tiran√´, Durr√´s or Shkod√´r and populations historically stemming from the tribes have become scattered. Locals that remained in northern Albanian areas associated with the tribes have maintained an awareness of their tribal identity.  Tribal regions  Map of bajraks and tribes by Franz Seiner, 1918.

It developed into a form of social commentary for black South Africans and has undergone several transformations with the country's changing political tides.  Origins and history  Pantsula dance emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a response to the forced removals implemented by the apartheid government, shortly after its ascent to power. It began in Alexandra and Sophiatown, two townships in Johannesburg, as groups of older men engaged in informal street dance competitions. Gradually the dance form spread throughout South Africa. By the 1980s, pantsula was practiced by black South Africans of all ages and was no longer limited to men. It began to develop more political overtones. Pantsula was used as an expression of resistance during the political struggle then occurring against the apartheid government, as well as being used to spread awareness about social issues such as AIDS. After the end of apartheid in 1994, pantsula persisted as an expression of cultural roots for many black South Africans. It also gained popularity in the white community of South Africa and has begun to take on new meanings as a dance form for all.  Technique  Pantsula is a syncopated, quick-stepping, low to the ground form of dance which evokes the urban street culture of which it is a part. It is performed by groups of dancers who practice together for many hours each week. It provides a powerful, stylized form of expression. As one pantsula dancer describes it, \\"we have drive, we are one, we have power, we are young, strong and quick, we have our own style and we are competitive.\\" It developed from the Sotho dances of mqaquanga and marabi, with influence from 1930s American jazz. Later evolutions of pantsula dancing in the 1980s were influenced by American hip hop and breakdance. Quick, darting steps in geometric lines with an uneven rhythmic quality characterize this form of movement. The Charleston, a knock-kneed manoeuvre from American jazz, as well as the popping and locking found in US hip hop, are also found in this form of dance. The word pantsula is Zulu, and refers to \\"waddling like a duck.\\" This flat-footed move with the buttocks sticking out is commonplace in the dance form. Pantsula has three styles: Western Style, Slow Poison, and Futhuza. Western Style is the most typically found form, and it is highly rigorous. The arms remain wrapped around an upright torso while the feet move in extremely fast and particular shuffling and jumping movements as groups of dancers move in and out of geometric formations. This form requires good physical command of the body. Slow Poison is like Western style in form, with mostly stationary arms and intricate lower body movements, but it is performed in a slow, steady fashion with a constant beat. Futhuza is infused with elements of American breakdancing and hiphop. This form utilizes the somewhat disjointed, sometimes fluid, robotic motion of popping and locking.  Music  Originally, pantsula dancers did not have access to recorded music and danced to live music, including voices like Bra Sello and \\"Big Voice Jack\\" Lerole. As radios became more readily available, dancers opted for international and US pop music, calling on icons like Michael Jackson as well as rappers including MC Hammer and Puff Daddy. However, in the 1990s, a particular type of music for pantsula emerged: kwaito. This multilingual music is typical of the myriad of cultures in South Africa, and is a blend of seSotho, isiZulu, English, and Afrikaans. It is strong and sharp, like pantsula, and projects a streetwise, gangster image. Pantsula was featured in the 2018 music video All the Stars by the artist Kendrick Lamar.https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/all-the-stars- kendrick-lamar-sza-video-afrocentrism- afrofuturism/554306/https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/watch-kendrick-lamar-and- szas-all-the-stars-video.htmlhttps://mg.co.za/article/2018-02-12-kendrick- lamars-new-video-all-the-stars-video-in-appropriation-scandal  See also  * African dance  References  Category:Dance in South Africa ","title":"Pantsula"},{"id":"39350974","text":"The Strelitz Buildings, located at 30 Mouat Street, Fremantle, were built in 1897 for Paul and Richard Strelitz. In October 1994, the buildings were permanently listed on the Western Australian State Heritage Register. Strelitz brothers In 1896 Fremantle rate books record that vacant lot 49, 30 Mouat St, was brought by Drummond and Strelitz. On 5 January 1897 plans were passed for the building of a warehouse and offices on the land. Rate books of 1897 show that the site was owned by the Strelitz brothers, and the books record their occupation as merchants and also indicate that the building had been completed. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) both brothers were interned as enemy aliens. Paul Strelitz Paul Strelitz arrived in Melbourne in 1886, but, following the reports of gold discovery, moved to Western Australia in 1894. Settling in the Fremantle area, Paul Strelitz established himself as a merchant, and was an inaugural councillor for the East Fremantle Municipal Council where he served for a year. In 1904 the Dutch government appointed Paul Strelitz as its consul in Western Australia. Richard Strelitz While working for a German shipping company, Richard Strelitz was posted to Victoria in 1892 where he worked for six months before being transferred to Western Australia. When his brother arrived in Fremantle, he left that company and together they established the firm Strelitz Brothers: Merchants and Shipping Agents. In 1897 Richard was appointed as the consul for Denmark; six years later, in 1903, he became the vice consul for Sweden and Norway. Buildings The building is believed to have been designed by architect JF Allen, because it similar to some of his other work. Allen also designed other buildings for the Strelitz brothers, in Hay, Murray and William Streets Perth. Approval for the building was given by the Fremantle Council on 5 January 1897 after a proposal was put to the council by Councillor Forsyth with the support of Councillor Instone. The building has a warehouse at the rear with two floors of office space in front. Tenants in the offices included the architect firm of Cavanagh and Keogh who designed a number of buildings in Fremantle. Notable tenant Between 1904 and 1906, Herbert Hoover, then a mining engineer for Bewick Moreing & Co, had an office in the building. Hoover later became the 31st President of the United States.

Gorham would make substantial contributions to the technology and capability of Japan's fledgling automobile industry, and worked with a number of companies that would eventually be merged into the Nissan Motor Company by Yoshisuke Aikawa, who would become a close friend and business partner to Gorham. In David Halberstam's 1986 book The Reckoning, Halberstam states: \\"In terms of technology, Gorham was the founder of the Nissan Motor Company\\" and that \\"In 1983, sixty-five years after [Gorham's] arrival... young Nissan engineers who had never met him spoke of him as a god and could describe in detail his years at the company and his many inventions.\\" Early life Gorham was born in San Francisco, California in 1888 to William J. Gorham, an Asia area manager at tire manufacturer B.F. Goodrich. He accompanied his father on business trips to Japan in his youth, and after graduating from Heald College founded Gorham Engineering in San Francisco with his father in 1911. The company's products included hot bulb engines, fire pumps, and motorboats. Career in Japan Gorham moved to Japan with his wife and children in 1918 during World War I. He was initially interested in the aviation industry, but after a year without success shifted his attentions to the automotive industry. Gonshiro Kubota, a successful businessman who founded and led his eponymously-named firm into becoming the largest manufacturer of agricultural machinery in Japan was eager to enter the automobile market. At the time, the only two mass-production Japanese automobile manufacturers were Isuzu, and Kaishinsha, founded by Matsujiro Hashimoto. Kubota hired Gorham as chief designer, with Gorham designing the vehicles and setting up the manufacturing plants for Gorham's three-wheeled automobile. Along with other Japanese investors, Kubota and Gorham would found Jitsuyo Jid≈çsha, who would manufacturer the three-wheeled automobile as the Gorham, and a four-wheeled automobile of Gorham's design as the Lila. Jitsuyo Jid≈çsha and Kaishinsha would later be merged into a predecessor of the Nissan Motor Company. He worked with a number of predecessors of the Nissan Motor Company, including Jitsuyo Jid≈çsha, Tobata Castings, and Nihon Sangy≈ç, before departing in 1936 to found his own company, Kokusan Seiki, a precision manufacturing company, which would later be merged into Hitachi. In May 1941, Gorham and his wife renounced U.S. citizenship and naturalised as Japanese citizens. They apparently chose to do this so that they could remain in Japan, as wartime conditions meant increasing restrictions on foreigners. During World War II, Gorham continued his engineering work at Hitachi, focusing on multicut lathes and jet engines. After the end of the war, the United States government declined to charge him or his wife with treason since they had become Japanese citizens before the war began; in fact, he ended up working in a liaison position with the headquarters of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur regarding industrial problems. Throughout the 1940s, he also frequently acted as a consultant for Canon Inc. regarding their procurement and factory management practises, and developed a close relationship with company president Takeshi Mitarai. Gorham died in 1949 with Mitarai at his bedside. Family Gorham was married and had two sons, William Jr. and Don Cyril. William Jr. was born in 1915 in Oakland, California; after completing middle school in Japan, he attended high school in the United States and was attending Caltech when Japan attacked the United States. After his deferment ended in 1943, he served with the Office of Naval Intelligence at Pearl Harbour as a specialist in interrogating Japanese POWs, and at the war's end he helped with surrender arrangements on the island of Saipan and analyzed the effects of US bombing raids on Tokyo. He later worked for the Otis Elevator Company, and died in 2003. Don was born in Oakland as well in 1918, but attended Tokyo Imperial University after high school and graduated in 1941 with a degree in Japanese language and literature. On the urging of his father, he moved to Washington, D.C. before war with Japan began. Like his brother, he served in the Office of Naval Intelligence during World War II, and continued there as a civilian employee after the war ended until beginning a second career as a translator in the 1970s. He died in 2011.

In other words, its structure suggests a single roll of film. Girl Imagined by Chance explores the nature of photography, thereby raising questions about the simulated and the real, the mediaization of consciousness, originality, and the construction of identity.

It and its immediate development the Driggs Dart 1 had some competition successes; the design was further developed into two seat sesquiplanes known as the Driggs Dart 2 and Skylark. In all, about twenty were built. Design and development The Bumblebee was designed by Ivan Driggs and built by the Johnson Airplane Company. It had advanced features: cantilever monoplanes were uncommon in the 1920s, steel tube framed lightplanes novel and enclosed cockpits rare. Its parasol wing had two spars of laminated spruce, the number of laminations decreasing outboard, and a birch skin from the leading edge to the rear spar. Behind this the wing was fabric covered, as were the steel framed ailerons. In plan the wing was tapered with rounded tips. The wing was attached to the fuselage with four cabane struts on each side, plus one sloping downwards aft centrally. The Bumblebee was powered by a Henderson four cylinder engine, carefully cowled with a cooling air inlet beneath the drive shaft of the two blade propeller. The fuselage was built from internally wire braced welded steel tubes, a method user by Fokker aircraft but unfamiliar on light planes. The forward fuselage including engine, cockpit and wing mounting was rectangular in cross-section, becoming triangular, vertex up, aft. The pilot sat under the forward part of the wing not in an open cockpit as usual at the time but surrounded by curved celluloid sheet, attached to the cabane struts, which extended upwards vertically from the fuselage to the wing underside but sloping aft. There was a celluloid window in the wing over his head to provide upward vision. Access to the cockpit was via a port side door. The empennage of the Bumblebee was, like the fuselage, steel framed. Its straight edged, braced tailplane and split elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage; the fin had a curved leading edge, the rudder moving in an elevator cut-out. The undercarriage was of the fixed, conventional type, with mainwheels on a single axle, each side attached to the fuselage by a single streamlined strut. The first DJ-1 flew in 1924, with the Henderson engine. Some images show it without its cockpit transparencies. On its earliest outings it was referred to as the Driggs-Johnson Jimmie. A developed version, the Driggs Dart 1, was flown in 1926; powered by a Anzani engine, this had a maximum speed of , though it was later fitted with a Wright-Morehouse engine. Operational history At least two DJ-1s were built. The first of these won the race sponsored by the Dayton Daily News in early October 1924 and came second in both the speed and efficiency competition and a cross country race for the Rickenbacker trophy. The second was sold to the US Army and was fitted with slots and flaps. The Wright-Morehouse powered Dart 1 received a lightplane prize in the 1926 Ford Air Tour, despite failing to complete the course, as it was the only lightplane competing.

His role in the film The First Strike was carefully planned to explain his role in the empire, his relationship with Flynn as well as how he decides to leave them. Yuri also been well received with many writers for video game publications finding him as an appealing protagonist that contrasted other heroes. His role in The First Strike also received positive reception. The positive response has resulted in Yuri often appearing in polls and Tales producer Hideo Baba commenting on whether they could create another character with similar traits. Creation and design Yuri's American voice actor, Troy Baker, considered voicing him a \\"rarity\\" due to starting the dub near the same time of the original Yuri Lowell was designed for Tales of Vesperia by regular series designer K≈çsuke Fujishima. Compared to other characters like Flynn, Fujisaka found designing Yuri a challenge, as he was a type of protagonist that the series had not featured previously. Yuri was created to be different from previous protagonists in the series such as Kyle Dunamis from Tales of Destiny 2 and Luke fon Fabre from Tales of the Abyss. While the stories of previous games focused on revealing and developing these characters' personalities, Yuri was given a more adult personality. As such, Yuri was in a position to aid in the growth of the main cast. The game's theme of justice came partially from this portrayal. His deep friendship with Flynn also formed the core theme of Bonnie Pink's theme song \\"Ring a Bell\\". Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike was affected by Yuri and Flynn's younger ages. Niren Fedrock was created to serve as a mentor figure as well as the possible future of the two's careers. Since Yuri was surer of his interest, the coming of age story was more focused on Flynn. The friendship between Yuri and Flynn was seen as \\"priceless\\" by director Kenta Kamei due to the mutual respect each other share as well as the occasion each gets angry. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri looks up at the sky of Ceazontania the night before the Knights expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future. In Japanese, Yuri has been voiced by Kosuke Toriumi. Yuri has been voiced in the English version of the game by Troy Baker. Baker wanted to pay a homage to the original Japanese version, and while working with the script, Baker started understanding the character, considering sometimes what Yuri would say in the game. When he was brought into the project, the script was at a very early stage of development, meaning that he and the rest of the localization team were able to get right into Yuri's personality: Troy stated that this kind of feeling was a relative rarity in the profession. During announcements from the rerelease of Tales of Vesperia, Baker commented that he would have liked doing all of Yuri's new lines again but was never approached by the localization team. This resulted in Yuri being voiced by actor Grant George for his new lines. Appearances In Tales of Vesperia The 21-year-old protagonist of Tales of Vesperia, Yuri was born and raised in the Lower Quarter of the Imperial Capital, Zaphias. He was a member of the Imperial Knights, but left after only three months of service because of his contempt for the Empire's treatment of its lower citizens. He is willing to help those in need, even if he has to take extreme measures to do so, adopting a vigilante-like attitude in many situations. He is an expert fighter, capable of wielding swords and axes. He attempts to chase the thief of the aque blastia core from Zaphias' lower quarter. Along with Yuri's faithful dog Repede and a young girl named Estellise, the three leave the safety of Zaphias' barrier to chase after both Flynn and the thief. On their journey, Yuri learns about the state of the world and the philosophy of the guilds, who gave up their citizenship in order to live free from the rule of the Empire. After forming several alliances, Yuri's group stop the machinations of an evil guild leader named Barbos and recover the aque blastia core. Yuri turns the core over to Flynn and announces his intention to form a guild with Karol, later named Brave Vesperia. Yuri, seeing how the laws of the Empire are powerless against the corruption within its officials, takes matters into his own hands and kills two corrupt officials: Ragou, a conspirator in Barbos' plot, and Captain Cumore, a high-born knight who was using his power to commit atrocities. Flynn confronts Yuri in order to settle the outstanding issue of Yuri's double homicide and his willingness to let Flynn take credit for all of his accomplishments. Yuri tells Flynn that he is the leader that the world needs right now, and that Yuri is happy to be a criminal in the shadows to achieve that end. Flynn accepts this, but warns that if Yuri continues to break the law then Flynn will have no choice but to stop him; an ultimatum that Yuri gladly accepts. Yuri then continues working with Brave Vesperia to find a sentinent creature that threatened Estellise's life. However, their mission changes when Estellise is kidnapped and face the Imperial Knights' Commandant Alexei. Although they succeed in defeating Alexei, the group sees the return of the Adephagos, a being that is capable of destroying the planet. The party then allies to find a way to destroy the Adephagos as well as to stop Duke Pantarei, who plans to use his own method of defeating the Adephagos at the cost of all human life. Other appearances Yuri also appears in the manga adaptation of the series as well as a novelization; the latter depicts his backstory. He also serves as one of the protagonists in the 2009 Japanese animated prequel film Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike. There, he joins the Imperial Knights because like Flynn, he wants to change the imperial law and justice. He goes on a mission to protect a town from mysterious monsters. However, their superior Niren dies in the evacuation. Fellow corpsman Garista reveals that he was attempting to create a new kind of blastia that would give humans total control over aer. After killing Garista, Yuri leaves the knights, taking Niren's blastia as a keepsake and bringing Repede along with him, saying his goodbyes to everyone in the town. The film ends with Yuri leaving the Imperial Knights and swearing to meet Flynn once again. Outside Vesperia, Yuri has also appeared in Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2 and Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 3 as a playable character. He also appears in Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave, Tales of VS. and Tales of the World: Reve Unitia. The first print of Tales of Xillia 2 also included Yuri's outfit for Jude Mathis. Outside the Tales games, Yuri has been present in Project X Zone alongside Estellise as well as in the PlayStation Portable version of Venus & Braves. He returned in Project X Zone 2 with Flynn as his partner. Reception Yuri has been well received by the gaming audience and publications for video games. GamesRadar listed him as the thirty-sixth best character from his generation praising his unusual traits rarely seen in other Tales protagonists. Similarly, Eliot Gay from Japanator said Yuri \\"was also something of a revelation. At 21, he was one of the older Tales main characters and far more mature than most JRPG fans are probably used to.\\" In a Famitsu poll from 2010, he was voted seventh best video game character. In a Dengeki poll, he was voted fourth as a character readers wanted to befriend. Ever since his debut, Yuri has also been voted as the most popular Tales character in official polls, reaching the same spot three times. In another poll, Estelle and him were voted as the fifth best duo within the series. In addition, Yuri and Flynn ranked first in the \\"Best/Ideal Partners\\" poll 3 years in a row. According to RPGamer, \\"Yuri is a compelling protagonist and even something of an anti-hero.\\" Jared Prewitt from the same site commented that Yuri \\"breaks the mold of previous Tales games by being more in control with his destiny and willing to eliminate the foes that are a threat to society.\\" In a Tales of Graces review, the reviewer commented \\"There are prevailing opinions that the story doesn't quite match up to that of Tales of Vesperias, possibility heavily influenced by the absence of Yuri Lowell.\\" GameTrailers commented on how Yuri's actions later on in the game \\"will test the threshold of some player's morals.\\" 1UP.com's Andrew Fitch credited Yuri for most of the plot's enjoyment calling him \\"badass, charismatic ex-knight.\\" They also compared him with Luke fon Fabre from Tales of the Abyss, finding Yuri more relatable and relevant than him, also adding that Yuri was \\"the embodiment of that vigilante spirit.\\" Eurogamer's Simon Parkin called Yuri a \\"strong protagonist\\" as he is \\"Old enough to be appealing to any player past their teens, yet flawed enough to be believable, he remains heroic enough to provide the leadership his role requires.\\" Parkin also gave praise to the character's voice acting for making his character more engaging. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the interactions between Yuri and Estelle as \\"heartfelt\\" as one of the scenes that helps to further characterize them. Reviewing Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike, John Rose from the Fandom Post praised both Yuri and Flynn's characters as \\"neither character is simply some cardboard cutout incapable of growth or prevented from having another aspect to their personality and it is in these moments where the characters are able to show off their differences and complexities that the two really shine.\\" Eliot Gay said both \\"Yuri and Flynn receive full arcs of development that get them to where they need to be by the start of the game. The film doesn't assume you know who either of these two men are and does an impressive job of defining their relationship and opposing views of the Imperial Guard.\\" Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman commented that both of Yuri's voice actors do a good job at \\"capturing his character\\" even though Troy Baker makes it \\"a little too masculine for his slightly feminine design.\\" Siliconera's Spencer spoke with Tales producer Hideo Baba, commenting how Yuri was quite popular in the west due to how well developed he is as a character. He added \\"He knows who he is rather than searching for himself like the young \\"gung ho\\" JRPG hero archetype.\\" In response Baba commented: \\"There is a possibility to have another Yuri-style character again, but I think it‚Äôs important to listen to the fan‚Äôs voices,\\" Baba responded. \\"The development team is always creating new worlds and characters, so it‚Äôs possible to see different kinds of leading characters.\\" References Category:Fictional swordsmen in video games Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Male characters in video games Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Namco protagonists Category:Role-playing video game characters Category:Tales characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2008 Category:Video game protagonists ","title":"Yuri Lowell"},{"id":"39351121","text":"Freienbach railway station may refer to: * Freienbach SBB railway station on the Lake Zurich left-bank railway line in Switzerland * Freienbach SOB railway station on the Pf√§ffikon SZ‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway line in Switzerland ","title":"Freienbach railway station"},{"id":"39351128","text":"The Dragonlance Chronicles is a trilogy of fantasy novels written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, which take place in the Dragonlance setting. This series is the first set of Dragonlance novels, and is followed by the Dragonlance Legends series. The three books in the series are Dragons of Autumn Twilight (November 1984), Dragons of Winter Night (July 1985), and Dragons of Spring Dawning (September 1985). History The Dragonlance Chronicles novels were based on a series of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) game modules. The Chronicles trilogy came about because the designers wanted novels to tell the story of the game world they were creating, something to which TSR, Inc. (TSR) agreed only reluctantly.. Soon after Tracy Hickman came to TSR in 1982, management announced the intention to develop his series of dragons based role-playing adventures. Hickman's storyline was chosen for the Dragonlance books due to the 12 part storyline. Hickman's proposal resulted in the Dragonlance Chronicles, which led to his association with Margaret Weis. Weis was assigned to edit Hickman's \\"Project Overlord,\\" as it was initially called, a novel intended to be coordinated with a trilogy of AD&D; modules. Weis and her new partner, Tracy Hickman, worked to plot the novel; they had hired an author, who didn't work out, but by that time, Weis and Hickman were so into the project that they felt they had to write it. Jean Black, the Managing Editor of TSR's Book Department, picked Hickman and Weis to write Dragons of Autumn Twilight and the rest of the Dragonlance Chronicles series. The storyline of the original Dragonlance series had been plotted and outlined before either the novel trilogy or the games were written.Tracey Hickman quoted in Synopsis The plot of the Dragonlance Chronicles is centered around the conflict known as the \\"War of the Lance\\", in which the Heroes of the Lance march to fight against Verminaard, the lord of the draconians, and the dark goddess Takhisis. While the main events of the war are covered in the original trilogy of books, some later released books occur during the same time period, such as War of the Lance. Several game modules for the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing game were also released that expanded on the events of the war, such as Dragons of Glory and Dragonlance Adventures. Dragons of Autumn Twilight A group of old friends and new companions meet and begin their journeys to become the Heroes of the Lance. They enter Xak Tsaroth, find the Disks of Mishakal, are captured, meet Gilthanas, invade Pax Tharkas, meet Elistan, who becomes the first cleric of Paladine, incite a subsequent slave revolt, and kill a Dragon Highlord. Dragons of Winter Night The companions continue in their journeys to become the Heroes of the Lance. They travel to Tarsis, which is destroyed in an ensuing dragon attack, split into two groups, one of which goes to Silvanesti only to find it ravaged by a nightmare caused by a Dragon Orb, the other to Icewall Glacier where they kill a Dragon Highlord and take his Dragon Orb. The former group succeeds in obtaining the Dragon Orb and ending the nightmare. The latter group is attacked as they escape and are stranded on Southern Ergoth, an island where they meet numerous elves. Eventually, they travel to the tomb of Huma, where they meet Fizban and a silver dragon in disguise. The former group travel to Sancrist Isle, where Sturm becomes a full Knight of Solamnia, a Dragon Orb is shattered, and a dragonlance is forged. The identity of another Dragon Highlord is discovered. The dragons attack, but are driven off with new dragonlances. Dragons of Spring Dawning The group continue and conclude their journey in becoming Heroes of the Lance. Reception Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, stated a positive review of Dragonlance Chronicles, remarking that while the novels were not very original compared to previous fantasy works by J.R.R. Tolkien and Fritz Leiber, they filled a void for new gamers in 1980's by introducing fantasy fiction archetypes in a rich, cohesive setting. Film The Dragonlance Chronicles have also been adapted as an animated movie entitled Dragons of Autumn Twilight, starring Michelle Trachtenberg, Kiefer Sutherland, Michael Rosenbaum, and Lucy Lawless, and directed by Will Meugniot. \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\\" was released on 15 January 2008.

Members of Shllaku tribe are Catholics. The region corresponds to today's Shllak Municipality near Shkod√´r. Geography The historical region of Shllaku corresponds to Shllak. The tribal region borders the Shkreli, Dushmani and Toplana tribal regions to the north. Origins According to tradition, the Toplana, the ancestor of Shllaku as well as of the Gashi can trace their lineage back to 1450 when they arrived in their present area from the territory where now Vasojeviƒái is located in Montenegro.: \\"–¢–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–∞ –∏ –®–ª–∞–∫—É –º–æ–≥—É –∫–∞–æ –∏ –ì–∞—à–∏ —Å–≤–æ—ò—É –ª–æ–∑—É –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ç–∏ –∏ –¥–æ 1450, –∫–∞–¥–∞ —Å—É –∫–∞–∫–æ —Å–µ –≤–µ–ª–∏, –¥–æ—à–ª–∏ –∏–∑ –í–∞—Å–æ—ò–µ–≤–∏—õ–∞ —É –ê–ª–±–∞–Ω–∏—ò—É\\" Vasojeviƒái tradition traces their origin from Central Albania and moved around 1450 to their present location. Thus, Nopcsa and others have arrived to the conclusion that at some point Vasojeviƒái drove southwards the ancestral group of Toplana around this time. According to tradition, recorded by Nopcsa, the tribal ancestor was named \\"Can Gabeti\\", one of four brothers (the others were the founder of the Gashi, Toplana and Megulla). Gabeti, said to have been an Orthodox Christian from Montenegro, came across the original native population who were the ancestors of the Kol√´ Pep Fura family and whose last male descendant died about 1900. The original population of Shllaku was called Lorehic and is said to be related to the family of the same name in Guri i Zi on the plain of Shkod√´r.  History  Albanians bayraks as of 1918, Shllaku covers section 58. The earliest available record of the name of the tribe is 'Scelacu' from 1641. Shllaku descends from Toplana tribe. In 1877 Ottoman soldiers from Shllaku attacked Montenegro. In 1922 this tribe had a population of 1,500.

Miller was born in Cape Town but spent his childhood in Johannesburg. After studying psychology and working in the corporate world for several years, Miller was driven by the injustices of apartheid to use his hobby, photography, to document opposition to apartheid by becoming a full-time photographer.\\"Eric Miller\\"; in Paul Weinberg, ed. Then and Now: Eight South African Photographers (Johannesburg: Highveld, 2007; ), p.53. Career Miller began his work as a freelance photographer with a collective called Afrapix, which used photography to document the realities of apartheid and the resistance to the regime during the 1980s. Miller first got the attention of the international wire services with a photograph of a mineworker and his partner in a room of a mineworkers' hostel. The photo was particularly meaningful as the unions were fighting for family housing for mine workers, rather than single-sex hostels which forced workers to leave their families behind to make a living. Soon after, Miller was hired for his first international lead, taking photographs of the 1987 strike in which over 300,000 mine workers across South Africa walked off the job. The majority of Miller's work early in his career was the documentation of strikes, protests and funerals which were manifestations of people's opposition to the apartheid regime and contributed to its eventual downfall. For three years from 1988, Miller worked for Reuters. During the early 1990s, as the world witnessed the crumbling of the apartheid government, the subject matter of Miller's work changed from protests and funerals to the negotiations that would eventually lead to a democratic South Africa. Once the transition to a post-apartheid government began, the focus of his and others' photography was on transformation issues such as health, education and labour. After Nelson Mandela's release from prison in February 1990, Miller gained access to countries across Africa that had previously been closed to South African passport holders. The first place Miller travelled to after Mandela's release was South Sudan, to document the famine that occurred there in the 1990s. He has pursued photographic projects in 28 different countries including Botswana, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Namibia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Uganda, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. Although Miller spent much time and effort documenting South Africa's first democratic election during April 1994, he was also able to travel to Rwanda to document the last 10 days of the genocide there. He then documented the conditions of the (primarily Tutsi) victims of the atrocity who fled to refugee camps in Tanzania. His work reflects not only the internal chaos and violence caused by the genocide in Rwanda, but also the lasting effects for those who were forced to flee, and the problems faced by the neighbouring countries to which they fled. Miller's collection of photographs from Rwanda was more recently used in a project which he presented at the University of Cape Town during a symposium on post-apartheid and post-genocide transitions and violence in South Africa and Rwanda. During Miller's numerous visits to Uganda, he focused on the devastating effects of the war waged by Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) on every sector of the population. He documented the issue of child soldiers, and spent time getting to know young adults who had escaped from the LRA after being forced, as children, to become its soldiers.Tanya Farber, \\"The fitness myths\\", Mail and Guardian, 6 July 2007.

Exhibitions Miller has been involved in several photographic exhibitions. His photography was shown in Then and Now, an exhibition which travelled to Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg, Melbourne and Brisbane, and is housed at Duke University.

Berisha is numbered 16. Berisha is a historical Albanian tribe (fis) and region in Puk√´, northern Albania. Berisha is one of the oldest documented Albanian tribes, first recorded in 1242 in Dulcigno. In the Middle Ages, it was widely spread across northern Albania, southern Montenegro and Kosovo. People who traced their origin to Berisha are also found in the coastal trading hubs of Dalmatia in the Middle Ages. Berisha formed its own territorial community in Puk√´ in the course of the 14th century. In the apex of feudal development in Albania at the end of the 13th and during the long 14th century, Berisha was in a process of de-tribalization and reorganization of some branches as feudal families. This process stopped in the wake of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th century and was followed by a strengthening of tribal and kinship ties in the region. Berisha of Puk√´ is a Catholic fis. In the Ottoman period, brotherhoods (vllazni) from Puka settled in parts of Tropoj√´, some areas of Kosovo and Skopska Crna Gora in Macedonia. These branches converted to Islam starting from the 18th century onwards. The surname Berisha is common in Puka, Tropoja and Kosovo. Geography The historical tribal area of the Berisha is located in the Puk√´ district, south of the Drin, west of Fierza, in northern Albania. The centre is the Sapa√ß river basin, flowing into the Drin. Berisha traditionally borders with Dushmani and Toplana to the west, Bugjoni to the north, Iball√´ to the east and Kabashi to the south. The main settlements are Berisha e Vog√´l (Lower Berisha), Shop√´l and Berisha e Ep√´rme (Upper Berisha). Its inhabitants are called Berishas. In terms of administrative division, Berisha is part of the Iball√´ municipal unit of Fush√´-Arr√´z. Origins Oral traditions and fragmentary stories were collected and interpreted by writers who travelled in the region in the 19th century about the early history of the Berisha tribe. Since then, analysis of recorded historical material, linguistics and comparative anthropology have resulted in more historically-grounded accounts. Of particular importance is the archival research of Lajos Thall√≥czy, who found the first historical record of Berisha in the archives of the Republic of Ragusa in 1242. His work allowed for further archival research. Thus, in the following years Baron Nopcsa traced the ancestry of Berisha with certainty back to 1370 and formulated a probable lineage as far back as 1270. Edith Durham, Baron Nopcsa and others recorded the most widely known oral tradition about the origin of Berisha, which is also part of the tradition of all other tribes in the area. According to it, the tribe's first direct ancestor is Kol Poga, son of Pog Murri, son of Murr Dedi. Kol Poga's brother was Lek√´ Poga, ancestor of M√´rturi. Pog Murri's brother was Dit Murri, ancestor of Shala, Shoshi and Mirdita. The grandfather of Kol Poga, Berisha's ancestor, Murr Dedi was also the progenitor of the Tha√ßi and Toplana tribes. Berisha of Puk√´ form four brotherhoods, all of whom trace their origin to Kol Poga: Tetaj (Teta), Maroj (Poga), Deskaj (Desku), Do√ßaj (Do√ßi). In Montenegro, Marko Miljanov from Kuƒçi wrote in his book about hims home region that the Kuƒçi and Berisha were \\"regarded close\\", allegedly because the Berisha ancestors settled from Kuƒçi; Konstantin Jireƒçek further recorded about this story that Old Kuƒçi (Staro Kuƒçi), which placed a Grƒça, son of Nenad as its ancestor also placed him as an ancestor of the Berisha tribe. On the contrary, in Berisha it is believed that Old Kuƒçi itself descends from Berisha and is called Berisha i Kuq (Red Berisha) as opposed to Berisha of Puk√´, M√´rturi and a part of Piperi that traces its origin from Berisha, who are collectively called Berisha i Bardh (White Berisha).. In historical record, Berisha and the Old Kuƒçi appear in different areas and timelines as Old Kuƒçi formed part of the tribe of current Kuƒçi, which was based on different ancestral groups in the late 15th century . Nevertheless, if not kin by blood, Montenegrin and Albanian tribes regarded closeness in original or home territory from where someone \\"came\\". Therefore, Serbian geographer Andrija Joviƒáeviƒá put forward the narrative that the Kuƒçi were \\"kin\\" to Kastrati, Berisha and Kelmendi because their distant ancestor once, ostensibly, settled in the same general area as Kuƒçi. In later times, one brotherhood of Kuƒçi, the Drekaloviƒçi traced their descent to Berisha. In turn, from them a part of the Kastrati trace their origin. Thus, these groups have the custom of avoiding intermarriage with each other. In Koja e Ku√ßit, a Catholic Albanian tribe, sometimes classified as part of the wider Kuƒçi region, the Pali brotherhood stems from Berisha and settled in that area around 1500. This brotherhood is considered part of Red Berisha. Another brotherhood in modern Montenegro that is taken to be kin with the tribe is the Vu≈°oviƒá brotherhood from Velika near Plav. In Luma, the Arr√´ni tribe is an offshoot of the Berisha. In general, brotherhoods from Berisha are widespread in north-eastern Albania. The Berisha of Tropoj√´ who form three brotherhoods: Isufmemaj, Halilaj, Papaj in the Ottoman period were part of the same bajrak as Kojeli, who are from M√´rturi and thus kin to Berisha.

These are the brothers, Demetrius (Dhimit√´r) and Nicola (Nikoll√´) Berisha. The family itself is described as vetusta Berrisius familia (ancient family of Berisha). In the siege of Svetigrad, Demetrius Berisha showed great courage when he saved the life of Skanderbeg who was wounded in midst of battle against the armies of Ballaban Pasha.Historia e Skenderbeut (Gjergj Kastriot) Mbretit te Shqiperise 1412-1468 prej Peshkopit Theofan ( Fan.S.Noli) fq 250-251 In 1691 the name Berisa is recorded on a map of Francesco Maria Coronelli. In 1841, Nikola Vasojeviƒá estimated the Berisha to number 16,000, out of whom 4,000 men-at-arms, but Elsie notes that this very high number probably includes neighbouring tribes. The Austro-Hungarian census in Albania (1918) recorded 171 households with 1,013 inhabitants of Berisha. It was later said that the population was 2,300. Some members of the Berisha tribe migrated to Kosovo, mostly to the region of Gjakova, and converted to Islam. According to British intelligence report, the reason for this migration was the small size of the territory this tribe controlled. The feast of the Catholic Berisha who lived in villages around Peƒá was the Assumption of Mary (to which they refer to as Zoja e Berishes, or Zoja e Alshiqes, because the Alshiqi are the most numerous). The family name Berisha is derived from the name of the tribe and is particularly common among Albanians in Kosovo. In the 1920s, the whole Berisha tribe in Kosovo, under the leadership of Azem Galica, revolted against the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Traditions The Berisha are Catholic.

One of engine's propeller blades passed through the fuselage and severed pneumatic, hydraulic, and emergency airbrake lines as well as the electrical wiring for Curtiss electric propeller controls and some engine instruments. The blade continued out of the fuselage and struck the no. 2 engine, disabling its lube oil scavenge pump and causing it to begin filling with oil. After an abortive attempt to land at Burbank, which became a touch-and-go when the crew discovered that hydraulic brakes, thrust reverse, and emergency air brakes were all inoperative, the captain elected to attempt an emergency landing on the longer, uphill Runway 34L at Van Nuys. Because of severe damage resulting in loss of power from the No. 2 engine, a bare firewall where the No. 3 engine had separated, and drag from the drooping landing gear and flaps, the airplane was unable to make it to the runway and attempted to land on a golf course in the final approach corridor. The nose of the aircraft struck a concrete foundation of a partially constructed building, separating the nose gear main trunnion and jamming the gear assembly up into the cockpit.

It is the direct use of computer simulation in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of a disease. More specifically, in silico medicine is characterized by modeling, simulation, and visualization of biological and medical processes in computers with the goal of simulating real biological processes in a virtual environment. History The term in silico was first used in 1989 at a workshop \\"Cellular Automata: Theory and Applications\\" by a mathematician from National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The term in silico radiation oncology, a precursor of generic in silico medicine was coined and first introduced by G. Stamatakos in Proceedings of the IEEE in 2002.G.Stamatakos, D.Dionysiou, E.Zacharaki, N.Mouravliansky, K.Nikita, N.Uzunoglu,\\"In silico radiation oncology: combining novel simulation algorithms with current visualization techniques,\\" Proceedings of the IEEE, vol.90, issue 11, 2002, pp.1764-1777, DOI: 10.1109/JPROC.2002.804685 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1046955&abstractAccess;=no&userType;=inst The same researcher coined and introduced the more generic term in silico oncology.Stamatakos, Georgios.; (2006) \\"Spotlight on Cancer Informatics\\" Cancer Informatics (2) pp.83-86 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/117693510600200029 OPEN ACCESS In silico medicine is considered an extension of previous work using mathematical models of biological systems. It became apparent that the techniques used to model biological systems has utility to explain and predict dynamics in the medical field. The first fields in medicine to use in silico modeling were genetics, physiology and biochemistry. The field saw a dramatic influx of data when the human genome was sequenced in the 1980s and 1990s. Concurrently the increase in available computational power allowed for modeling of complex systems that were previously impractical. Rationale There are numerous reasons why in silico medicine is used. For example, in silico medical modeling can allow for early prediction of success of a compound for a medicinal purpose and elucidate potential adverse effects early in the drug discovery process.Ahmet, Ahmet; Sean, Ekins; Sandhya, Kortagere. \\"Applications and Limitations of In Silico Models in Drug Discovery.\\" Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery, 2012-01-08. V910, p87-124. http://www.springerprotocols.com/Abstract/doi/10.1007/978-1-61779-965-5_6 In silico modeling can also provide a humane alternative to animal testing. It has been purported by a company in the field, that computer-aided models will make the use of testing on living organisms obsolete.http://www.insilico- biotechnology.com/en/improving-the-welfare-of-animals-researchers-develop- computer-aided-models-to-replace-animal-testing  Examples  The term in silico medicine is exemplified in initiatives such as the Virtual Physiological Human by the European Commission and in institutes such as the VPH Institute and the INSIGNEO Institute at the University of Sheffield.

The bombings targeted African-American leaders of the Birmingham campaign, a mass protest for racial justice. The places bombed were the parsonage of Rev. A. D. King, brother of Martin Luther King Jr., and a motel owned by A. G. Gaston, where King and others organizing the campaign had stayed. It is believed that the bombings were carried out by members of the Ku Klux Klan, in cooperation with Birmingham police. In response, local African-Americans burned businesses and fought police throughout the downtown area. Civil rights protesters were frustrated with local police complicity with the perpetrators of the bombings, and grew frustrated at the non-violence strategy directed by King. Initially starting as a protest, violence escalated following local police intervention. The Federal government intervened with federal troops for the first time to control violence during a largely African-American riot. It was also a rare instance of domestic military deployment independent of enforcing a court injunction, an action which was considered controversial by Governor George Wallace and other Alabama whites. The African-American response was a pivotal event that contributed to President Kennedy's decision to propose a major civil rights bill. It was ultimately passed under President Lyndon B. Johnson as the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Background  On May 10, 1963, negotiators for the city, local businesses, and the civil rights campaign had completed and announced the \\"Birmingham Truce Agreement.\\" The agreement included city and business commitments for partial desegregation (of fitting rooms, water fountains, and lunch counters in retail stores), promises of economic advancement for African-American workers, release of persons who had been arrested in demonstrations, and the formation of a Committee on Racial Problems and Employment. In an afternoon press conference held at the Gaston Motel, where King and his team were staying, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth read a version of the agreement, after which King declared a \\"great victory\\" and prepared to leave town.Bernstein, Promises Kept (1991), p. 92. However, some white leaders, including the city's powerful Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor, who had used dogs and firehoses against demonstrators, denounced the agreement and suggested that they might not enforce its provisions.Bernstein, Promises Kept (1991), pp. 92‚Äì93. Preparations On the morning of May 11, 1963, state troopers were withdrawing from Birmingham under orders from Governor George Wallace. Investigator Ben Allen had been alerted about a potential bombing of the Gaston Motel by a source within the Klan and recommended that these troops stay for a few more days. Allen's warning was disregarded by state Public Safety Director Al Lingo, who said he could \\"take care of\\" the Klan threat.Diane McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 424. \\"By daybreak on Saturday, May 11, Governor Wallace's army of state troopers had pulled out of Birmingham. State investigator Ben Allen had argued for staying through the weekend. A reliable Klan informant had told him that the Gaston Motel was going to be bombed. \\"Colonel\\" Al Lingo, Wallace's public safety director, brushed aside Allen's concerns, saying that he could \\"take care of\\" the Klan leader. It wasn't clear whether he meant that he would, or merely could, call off the bombing.\\" Martin Luther King, Jr., left Birmingham for Atlanta.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 425. Also during the day on May 11, Klan leaders from across the South were assembling in nearby Bessemer, Alabama for a rally. Klan Imperial Wizard Robert Shelton addressed the white crowd, urging rejection of \\"any concessions or demands from any of the atheist so-called ministers of the nigger race or any other group here in Birmingham.\\" He also said that \\"Klansmen would be willing to give their lives if necessary to protect segregation in Alabama.\\"May, The Informant (2005), p. 70. The crowd was, reportedly, unenthusiastic, as they were demoralized by the momentum toward desegregation.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), pp. 425‚Äì426. \\"Shelton's inability to rev up this family crowd was perhaps the truest reflection of the sea change that had been inspired by Birmingham that week. In the growing consensus that segregation had to go, the Klan was losing its mainstream appeal and shrinking into a purely terrorist cell.\\" The rally ended at 10:15 pm.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 427. At 8:08 PM that evening, the Gaston Motel received a death threat against King, Bombings At around 10:30 PM, a number of Birmingham police departed the parking lot of the Holy Family Hospital, driving toward the home of Martin Luther King's brother, A. D. King, in the Ensley neighborhood. Some police traveled in an unmarked car.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 427. \\"At Holy Family Hospital in Ensley, a few miles from where the Klan rally had ended at around 10:15, the Alabama Christian Movement's Carter Gaston was keeping vigil over Shuttlesworth. Sometime between 10:30 and 11, Sister Marie, the nurse who had developed a proprietary attitude toward her patient's Movement, motioned Gaston and said, 'Watch this.' Three carloads of police were in the parking lot. Some officers got out of their cruisers and headed in the direction of A. D. King's house a few blocks away. A. D. King residence At about 10:45 PM, a uniformed officer got out of his police car and placed a package near A. D. King's front porch. The officer returned to the car. As the car drove away, someone threw a small object through the house's window onto the sidewalk, where it exploded. The object created a small but loud explosion and knocked over bystander Roosevelt Tatum.Ben Greenberg, \\"From Delmar to Bombingham (5) ‚Äî THE BOMBING\\", Hungry Blues, 28 June 2004. Tatum got up and moved toward the King house‚Äîonly to face another, larger, blast from the package near the porch. This explosion destroyed the front of the house. Tatum survived and ran toward the back of the house, where he found A. D. King and his wife Naomi trying to escape with their five children. Tatum told King that he had seen police deliver the bombs. King called the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), demanding action against the local police department.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 428. \\"Inside the bombed house, among the indignant well- wishers, Roosevelt Tatum told A. D. King what he had seen before the explosions. King called the FBI. It seemed that, at long last, the bureau might get around to investigating a bombing in Birmingham.\\" Gaston Motel Bomb wreckage near Gaston Motel At 11:58 PM, a bomb thrown from a moving car detonated immediately beneath Room 30 at the Gaston Motel‚Äîthe room where Martin Luther King had been staying. The Gaston Motel was owned by A. G. Gaston, an African-American businessman who often provided resources to assist the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Attorney and activist Orzell Billingsley had intended to sleep in Room 30 because he was exhausted from days of negotiation and his wife was throwing a party at the couple's house. However, he was so tired that he fell asleep at home after stopping there for clothes.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 429. The motel bomb could be heard all over town. It interrupted the singing of children in the juvenile detention center, most of whom had been arrested during the civil rights demonstrations. Next, the children heard the sound of white men repeatedly singing \\"Dixie\\" over the jail's loudspeakers. Bryan McFall of the FBI was expecting his Klan informant Gary Rowe to report at 10:30 PM, immediately after the end of the Klan rally.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 428. McFall searched in vain for Rowe until finding him at 3:00 AM in the VFW Hall near the Gaston Motel. Rowe told McFall, his FBI handler, that Black Muslims had perpetrated a false flag bombing in order to blame the Klan. McFall was unconvinced.May, The Informant (2005), p. 71. However, in submitting his final report to J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, McFall did not identify the Klan as potentially responsible for the bombing, nor did he question the credibility of Rowe as an informant.May, The Informant (2005), p. 73. \\"If Byron McFall suspected that Rowe was involved, he kept his doubts to himself. In a report written for the special agent in charge, McFall did note that Rowe was unreachable for several hours but described his excuse without comment. The later report that went to Washington never even mentioned the missing informant and, in fact, accepted Rowe's version of events. The Klan, J. Edgar hoover was told, was not responsible for the bombings on May 11, 1963. And nine days later, McFall submitted an evaluation in which he rated the informant 'EXCELLENT'. Once again, the FBI decided to protect its informant rather than investigate whether he had broken the law.\\" Contemporary historians widely believe that the bombing was carried out by four Klan members, including Gary Rowe and known bomber Bill Holt.May, The Informant (2005), p. 72. Rowe was already suspected by the Klan to be a government informant, and other members may have compelled him to assist with the bombing in order to test his fidelity to the white supremacy cause.  Unrest  Many African-American witnesses held police accountable for the bombing of the King house, and immediately began to express their anger. Some began to sing \\"We Shall Overcome,\\" while others began to throw rocks and other small objects.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), pp. 427‚Äì428. More people mobilized after the second blast. As it was Saturday night, many had been celebrating the agreement that had been reached and had been drinking. Many of them were already frustrated with the strategy of nonviolence as espoused by Martin Luther King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference and turned to violence. Three African-American men knifed white police officer J. N. Spivey in the ribs.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 430. Several reporters who had been drinking at the bar got into a shared rental car and headed toward the commotion. A crowd of about 2,500 people had formed and was blocking police cars and fire trucks from the Gaston Motel area.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 431. A fire that started at an Italian grocery store spread to the whole block. As traffic started to move, Birmingham Police drove their six- wheeled armored vehicle down the street, spraying tear gas.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 432. An unexplained U.S. Army tank also appeared.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 433. At 2:30 AM, a large battalion of state troopers, commanded by Al Lingo and armed with submachine guns, arrived on the scene. About 100 were mounted on horses. These troops menaced any African-Americans remaining in the street, as well as the white journalists, who were forced into the lobby of the motel. Hospitals treated more than 50 wounded people.Bernstein, Promises Kept (1991), p. 93. The white journalists and a group of blacks were sequestered in the bombed motel (with no food or water) until morning.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 437. Heavily armed forces continued to patrol the streets, \\"giving this industrial city...\\" (in the words of one newspaper report) \\"the appearance of a city under siege on this Mother's Day.\\" \\"Riots Erupt in Birmingham: JFK Sends Troops to State: Thousands Clash After Bombings: Blasts Rip Home of Negro Motel; Nearly 50 Hurt\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 13 May 1963.  Operation Oak Tree  U.S. President John F. Kennedy ended a vacation at Camp David (near Thurmont, Maryland) early in order to respond to the situation.\\"JFK Ends His Weekend At Camp David\\", Lodi News-Sentinel, 13 May 1963. Conflicted about whether to deploy federal troops, Kennedy wanted to save face after the violence in Birmingham became covered as international news, and he wanted to protect the truce that had just been established. At the same time, he did not want to set a precedent that might compel routine military interventions, and he feared a backlash among southern white Democrats who opposed a federal \\"invasion.\\"Branch, Pillar of Fire (2007), p. 138. In Kennedy's opinion, however, in Birmingham \\"the people who've gotten out of hand are not the white people, but the Negroes by and large,\\" thus making intervention more palatable.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 438. Over TV and radio, Kennedy announced that the \\"government will do whatever must be done to preserve order, to protect the lives of its citizens ... [and to] uphold the law of the land.\\" He raised the alert for troops on nearby military bases and suggested that the Alabama National Guard might be federalized. He also dispatched Department of Justice attorney Burke Marshall, who had just returned to Washington, D.C. after helping to broker the Birmingham Truce.Scheips, Federal Military Forces (2005), p. 138.

General Creighton Abrams and headquartered with the FBI in the Birmingham federal building.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), pp. 442‚Äì443. At the operation's peak (on May 18), about 18,000 soldiers were placed on one-, two-, or four-hour alert status, prepared to respond to a crisis in the city.Scheips, Federal Military Forces (2005), p. 139.McWhorter, Carry Me Home (2001), p. 443. Governor Wallace learned of Operation Oak Tree on May 14 and complained. In response, Kennedy quietly shifted the Operation's headquarters to Fort McClellan while a handful of officers remained behind at the federal building.Scheips, Federal Military Forces (2005), p. 140. Wallace complained again, to the Supreme Court. The Court responded that Kennedy was exercising his authority within U.S. Code Title X, Section 333, stating: \\"Such purely preparatory measures and their alleged adverse general effects upon the plaintiffs afford no basis for the granting of any relief.\\" Perceived inefficiencies of the operation led the Joint Chiefs of Staff to draft a memo on preparedness for domestic civil disturbances. According to this memo, the newly created Strike Command should be able \\"to move readily deployable, tailored Army forces ranging in size from a reinforced company to a maximum force of 15,000 personnel.\\"Scheips, Federal Military Forces (2005), p. 142. The Strike Command designated seven Army brigades (amounting to about 21,000 soldiers) as available to respond to civil unrest.Scheips, Federal Military Forces (2005), p. 143. The Operation also led the military to increase its efforts at autonomous intelligence gathering, as well as collaboration with the FBI.Scheips, Federal Military Forces (2005), p. 144. Significance Birmingham activist Abraham Woods considered the disorder to be a \\"forerunner\\" to the 1967 wave of riots that followed passage of civil rights legislation and expressed protest at the slow rate of change.Howell Raines, My Soul is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered (Penguin Books, 1983) p. 165 Operation Oak Tree was the first time in modern United States history that the federal government deployed military power in response to civil unrest without a specific legal injunction to enforce. New York City Congressman Adam Clayton Powell warned that if Kennedy did not move quickly on civil rights in Birmingham, as well as nationally, then riots would spread throughout the country, including to the capital in Washington, DC.NBC News, 6 May 1963 Malcolm X affirmed Powell's warning, as well as his criticism of the president.WSB newsfilm clip from May 16, 1963 Malcolm cited the federal response to the Birmingham crisis as evidence of skewed priorities:M S. Handler, \\"Malcolm X Scores Kennedy on Racial Policy: Says He Is 'Wrong Because His Motivation Is Wrong': Head of Black Muslim Group Cites Birmingham Crisis\\", New York Times, 17 May 1963; accessed via ProQuest. > President Kennedy did not send troops to Alabama when dogs were biting black > babies. He waited three weeks until the situation exploded. He then sent > troops after the Negroes had demonstrated their ability to defend > themselves. In his talk with Alabama editors Kennedy did not urge that > Negroes be treated right because it is the right thing to do. Instead, he > said that if the Negroes aren't well treated the Muslims would become a > threat. He urged a change not because it is right but because the world is > watching this country. Kennedy is wrong because his motivation is wrong. Malcolm X later said in his well-known Message to the Grass Roots speech: > By the way, right at that time Birmingham had exploded, and the Negroes in > Birmingham ‚Äî‚Äî remember, they also exploded. They began to stab the crackers > in the back and bust them up 'side their head ‚Äî‚Äî yes, they did. That's when > Kennedy sent in the troops, down in Birmingham. So, and right after that, > Kennedy got on the television and said \\"this is a moral issue.\\" Malcolm X's evaluation is largely confirmed by modern scholarship. Nicholas Bryant, author of the most comprehensive study of President Kennedy's decision-making on civil rights policy, notes that during the predominantly nonviolent Birmingham campaign, Kennedy refused to make a commitment to forceful intervention or new legislation. He resisted the influence of the powerful, internationally publicized photograph of a police dog tearing into an African-American youth. The legislative situation was hopeless, he claimed, and he did not think the events in Birmingham would influence the voting intentions of a single lawmaker ... While Kennedy recognized the potent symbolic value of the [police dog] image, he was unwilling to counteract it with a symbolic gesture of his own.\\"Nicholas Andrew Bryant, The Bystander: John F. Kennedy And the Struggle for Black Equality (Basic Books, 2006), 338 Bryant concludes: > It was the black-on-white violence of May 11 - not the publication of the > startling photograph a week earlier ‚Äì that represented the real watershed in > Kennedy's thinking, and the turning point in administration policy. Kennedy > had grown used to segregationist attacks against civil rights protesters. > But he ‚Äì along with his brother and other administration officials ‚Äì was far > more troubled by black mobs running amok.Bryant, The Bystander, 393 Timothy Tyson affirms this position, writing that \\"The violence threatened to mar SCLC's victory but also helped cement White House support for civil rights. It was one of the enduring ironies of the civil rights movement that the threat of violence was so critical to the success of nonviolence.\\"Timothy B. Tyson, \\"The Civil Rights Movement,\\" in The Oxford Companion to African- American Literature, eds. William L.

The index is designed for self-paced workers and does not rely on estimation of actual metabolic rates, a process that is difficult and subject to considerable error. The index has been introduced into the United Arab Emirates and Australia, resulting in a substantial and sustained fall in the incidence of heat illness in the latter.  History  The idea of a thermal work limit (TWL) was developed by Dr. Graham Bates and Dr. Derrick Brake in 1997. Over the past 80 years, many heat stress indices have been developed to assist with the management of heat stress problems. Some of these have been developed for particular industries and empirically derived such as ISO 7933 and WBGT. These indices required estimation of metabolic rate but failed to consider the direct measurement of wind speed, reduction of work rate, location and time shift during work and removal of clothing, making these indices not accurate for self-paced and acclimatized workers. The need for a heat stress index designed primarily for self-paced workers has led to the development of the thermal work limit (TWL). TWL and its accompanying management protocols have been introduced into several industrial operations where workers are subject to thermal stress. Approximately 1400 persons work in these locations with over 10 million man- shifts being worked between 1965 and 1995 at wet bulb temperatures in excess of . Since the introduction of TWL-based policies in the Australian mining industry, the amount of man-hours lost due to serious heat illness has fallen from 12 million to 6 million, and the amount lost due to all heat illness incidences has fallen from 31 million to 18 million.  Theory  The basic purpose of the thermal work limit index is to calculate the maximum metabolic rate, in watts of metabolic heat per square meter of body surface area, that can be continuously expended in a particular thermal environment, in order to keep the body within safe physiological limits. The TWL is an integrated measure of the dry bulb, wet bulb, wind speed and radiant heat. From these variables, and taking into consideration the type of clothing worn and acclimatization state of the worker, the TWL predicts the maximum level of work that can be carried out in a given environment, without workers exceeding a safe core body temperature and sweat rate. In excessively hot conditions, the index can also determine the safe work duration, thus providing guidelines for work/rest cycling. Sweat rates are also calculated, so the level of fluid replacement necessary to avoid dehydration can be established. The thermal work limit algorithm builds on work originated by Mitchell and Whillier, who developed an index ‚Äúspecific cooling power,‚Äù which subsequently became known as ‚Äúair cooling power‚Äù (ACP). TWL calculation sheet, Abu Dhabi  Methodology  To determine TWL the following must be measured: * Dry Bulb Temperature (ambient air temperature) (in degrees ¬∞C) * Wet Bulb Temperature (determined by the humidity/evaporation) (in degrees ¬∞C) * Globe Temperature (determined by the radiant heat) (in degrees ¬∞C) * Wind speed in meters per second The thermal environment can be classified on the basis of TWL into the working zones shown in the adjacent image.  Application  Thermal work limit application in the field The TWL heat stress index is the heat stress index that has been included in the Abu Dhabi EHSMS code of practice for the management of Heat Stress. TWL gives a measure of the maximum safe work rate for the environmental conditions present at a worksite. If TWL is too low then even low rates of work cannot safely be carried out continuously and extra rest breaks and other precautions are needed to ensure worker safety.

He played for several years for Distillery in his native country before turning professional with Celtic. After a spell in the United States with the Detroit Cougars, he spent seven years with English Football League club Lincoln City and had a spell in non-league football with Lincoln United. Kennedy was an amateur international for Northern Ireland, played for the Irish League representative team, and kept goal for Great Britain in qualifying matches for the 1964 Summer Olympics. Life and club career Kennedy was born in Newtownards, Northern Ireland. He attended a rugby-playing school, but played association football for Boys' Brigade and church teams. When he was 18, he signed for Distillery as an amateur. He made his first-team debut in 1958, and soon became the club's regular goalkeeper. He helped Distillery win the Irish League title in 1962‚Äì63 ‚Äì their first championship in 60 years ‚Äì in a 4‚Äì2 defeat of their nearest rivals, Linfield, on the last day of the season, and played on the losing side against the same opposition in the 1963 Irish Cup Final. The League win afforded qualification for the preliminary round of the European Cup, in which Distillery were drawn against Portuguese champions Benfica, who had reached the final the previous year. Kennedy kept goal as Distillery, captained by the 41-year-old former England international Tom Finney, who was reportedly paid ¬£500 to come out of retirement to play in the game, held the twice European champions to a 3‚Äì3 draw. They lost the second leg 5‚Äì0. By the end of his Distillery career, Kennedy had played 241 games in the Irish League, and had won the County Antrim Shield in 1964 and the City Cup twice. In March 1965, Kennedy turned professional and became Jock Stein's first signing as manager of Celtic, for a ¬£5,000 fee. He played only one first-team game for the club in two seasons. He replaced regular goalkeeper John Fallon for the second leg of a League Cup quarter-final against Raith Rovers, and kept a clean sheet as Celtic progressed 12‚Äì1 on aggregate, but Stein selected Ronnie Simpson for the next Scottish League match, and it was Simpson who established himself in the starting eleven. Kennedy was released at the end of the 1966‚Äì67 season, and guested for the Glentoran team that played as the Detroit Cougars in the United Soccer Association, an embryonic professional league in the United States whose inaugural season featured only imported teams. On his return, he signed for Lincoln City of the Football League Fourth Division. He went straight into the first team, and was ever-present for his first 18 months. A fractured elbow, sustained in the first half of an FA Cup replay against Chester which Lincoln won to earn a third-round meeting with First Division club Birmingham City, kept him out for the second half of the 1968‚Äì69 season, but once he regained fitness he kept his place as first-choice goalkeeper until ending his Football League career at the end of the 1973‚Äì74 season. He had played 278 senior matches for the club, of which 251 came in the Football League. In 1970, Kennedy was the first to receive Lincoln City's Supporters' Club Player of the Season award. He remained with the club for a time as a youth coach, and played for Lincoln United in the Yorkshire League. A cartilage operation put an end to his playing career. While at Lincoln City, Kennedy had combined football with a teaching career. He remained in the Lincoln area after he finished playing football, where he taught at the City School until his retirement in 1994. Representative football Kennedy won seven caps for the Northern Ireland amateur international team. He played twice in early 1961, against Wales and Scotland in the British amateur Home Championship, and in five consecutive games from September 1963 against England to January 1965 against Wales. He \\"put up a brilliant show during the spells of heavy Welsh pressure\\" in 1964 to ensure a draw, which combined with a defeat of England and a draw with Scotland contributed to Northern Ireland winning that year's British amateur championship outright. After the other goalkeeper in Great Britain's squad, Griffin of Leytonstone, struggled in a 4‚Äì0 defeat in a warmup match against a Manchester United reserve team, the Daily Express predicted that Kennedy would keep goal in the Olympic qualifier against Greece.

Career  Kergariou-Locmaria was born on 17 September 1739 at Coatilliau Castle, near Lannion, in a family of old nobility. He was brother to Jonathas de Kergariou-Locmaria,killed in 1765 during the Larache expedition to Pierre-Joseph de Kergariou-Rosconnet and to Raymond-Marie de Kergariou-Coatl√®s.  Early career  Kergariou-Locmaria joined the Navy in the Gardes de la Marine in 1755, and served on the 50-gun Aigle, under Captain de Saint-Alouarn, in a fleet bound for Saint-Domingue and commanded by P√©rier. Promoted to Ensign on 17 April 1757,Levot, Biographie bretonne, vol.2, p. 10 he was appointed to command the batteries of the coastal defences of Saint-Domingue. He served at sea from 1758 to 1770, appointed first on and taking part in the Siege of Louisbourg, and from 1759 on Sardine.Taillemite, p. 273 He then served on Orient, on which he took part in the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. He later served as an officer on the frigates H√©b√©, from 1760, and Licorne, from 1762. In Licorne, he took part in the raids against British establishments on Newfoundland, under Admiral de Ternay. After Ternay's expedition, Kergariou-Locmaria returned to the Caribbean, serving on the frigate Com√®te from 1763, the 80-gun Saint-Esprit from 1764, the fluyt Balance in 1766 and eventually the frigate Belle-Poule from 1769. In February 1770, Kergariou-Locmaria was promoted to Lieutenant. In 1772, he took part in a campaign in the Indian Ocean on Belle- Poule, before taking command of the fluyt Esturgeon in 1773. In 1774, he was appointed to command the 14-gun corvette Serin, on which he patrolled and captured several British slave ships. In 1775, Kergariou-Locmaria was appointed Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. In 1776, Kergariou served off √éle de France as an officer on the 56-gun Brillant. Two years after, he was appointed to command the frigate Oiseau, part of a fleet under Orvilliers. In 1779, he returned on Belle-Poule, this time as her captain.  Service on Junon  Promoted to Captain on 13 March 1779, Kergariou-Locmaria received command of the frigate Junon, on which he captured the British corvette , on 13 September of that year.Roche, vol.1, p. 269 In May 1781, Kergariou transferred to the prestigious first-rate Royal-Louis, on which he served as first officer in Guichen's squadron.  Service on Sibylle  In June 1781, Kergariou was appointed to command the 32-gun frigate Sibylle. During the Action of 18 October 1782, Sibylle supported Scipion, under Grimouard.Levot, Gloires maritimes, p. 221 Sibylle departed Saint-Domingue, along with the 14-gun corvette Railleur, escorting a 16-ship convoy bound for North America. On 2 January 1783, the convoy was chased by the 44-gun ship of the line HMS Endymion and the 32-gun frigates HMS Emerald and Magicienne. Kergariou- Locmaria signaled the convoy to pursue its route with the Railleur, and endeavoured to cover its retreat, first engaging Magicienne. In the ensuing exchange of fire, Kergariou-Locmaria was severely wounded, but his first officer, Morel d'Escures, took command and managed to dismast Magicienne. Sibylle retreated when the Endymion and Emerald intervened.Levot, Gloires maritimes, p. 257 Thomas Graves, who commanded Magicienne, later commissioned two engravings of the battle, one representing its beginning, and the other its end. Four days later, a gale entirely dismasted Sibylle; Kergariou- Locmaria was forced to have twelve guns thrown overboard to keep his ship afloat. In distress, Sibylle was spotted by the British corvette, HMS Hussar, under Thomas McNamara Russell, yielding the Action of 22 January 1783. Kergariou ordered a British flag hoisted over the French ensign, indicating that Sibylle was a British prize captured from the French, and furthermore had a yachting ensign hoisted upside down as a distress signal; Hussar was not fooled by the ruse, and Kergariou lowered the British flag and fired a broadside at Hussar to prevent her from warning the rest of the British forces of his presence.Troude, vol.2, p. 238 However, the yachting ensign got stuck and could not be lowered. Hussar fired a single broadside that struck Sibylle under the floating line, inundated her poweder reserves and caused leaks so severe that her pumps could not compensate. Kergariou ordered twelve more guns thrown overboard; when Hussar returned with the 50-gun HMS Centurion, Kergariou's situation became hopeless and he struck his colours after Centurions second broadside. Controversy later ensued when Russell accused Kergariou of firing a broadside while flying British colours and distress signals. After receiving Kergariou's sword, Russell broke it publicly, accusing him of bad faith and violation of the laws of war; Kergariou and his officers were kept under guard in the orlop, fed basic food rations, and were not given bedding to sleep. Later, Admiral Digby received Kergariou with courtesy. In the automatic court-martial for the loss of his ship, the allegations were brought to the attention of the court; Kergariou-Locmaria was honourably discharged of all accusations of wrongdoing. On 16 August 1784, Kergariou-Locmaria was admitted to the Society of the Cincinnati. At the end of the American War of Independence, he totalled nine campaigns in America, three journeys in the Indian Ocean, had fought in three battles and had been severely wounded.Levot, Biographie bretonne, vol.2, p. 11  French Revolution and the Battle of Quiberon  In 1786, Kergariou was given command of the frigate Calypso, leading a three-year expedition in the Indian Ocean. At the beginning of the French Revolution, Kergariou-Locmaria emigrated. He later took part in the British-sponsored Invasion of France in 1795, where he was captured by Republican forces under General Hoche. Tried by the Revolutionaries, he was sentenced to death. Geoffroy d'Antrechaux later reported that Kergariou thus addressed his troops: Kergariou is also reported to have recited a memorial office to his fellow prisoners before being shot. Amongst the others executed that day was his brother Kergariou-Rosconnet.

His research is mainly concerned with nonlinear physics and complex systems sciences and their applications to challenging problems in Earth system, physiology, systems biology and engineering. Biography Kurths studied mathematics at the University of Rostock and was awarded his PhD in 1983 at the GDR Academy of Sciences, followed by his installation in 1991 in theoretical physics at the University of Rostock. In 1991, in a special program of the Max-Planck-Society, he was selected as one of a few scientists from East Germany to become a director of a new working group and he has formed an internationally well-known group on nonlinear dynamics. In 1994 he got a full-chair on theoretical physics/nonlinear dynamics at the University of Potsdam. There he was also Dean of the Science Faculty (1996‚Äì1999), and established as the founding director the Interdisciplinary Centre for Dynamics of Complex Systems (1994‚Äì2008). He was the founding director of the Leibniz- Kolleg Potsdam.

The company was founded in Barking, Essex, 1920, as Collaro Ltd, and was a private company in 1924. In 1961 it was described as the largest manufacturers of record changers in the United Kingdom, and also manufactured fan heaters. In 1960 it was reported in US publication 'Billboard' that the President of the American Magnavox corporation, Frank Freimann had announced the 'acquisition' of Collaro, along with managing director of Collaro, Isaac Wolfson. However, he is also reported as noting that \\"the linking of the two firms carries not only product but distribution ramifications,\\" which suggests some sort of cooperative alliance with acquisition of selling rights rather than a total 'buy-out'. Isaac Wolfson, a major British industrialist, was at the time also the head of Great Universal Stores, a large chain of retail outlets throughout Britain, Continental Europe, and the British Empire, suggesting perhaps that an earlier link-up took place between Wolfson and the originators of Collaro. The record decks comprised the mechanical unit incorporating a turntable and pickup, without electronics, and were built into many manufactured and home-constructed record players of the time. Magnavox were acquired by Philips in 1974. The Collaro Transcriptor, and Collaro Studio were tape decks (mechanisms without associated electronics) that were incorporated into many home tape recorders at the time.

With its large natural rock arches, a network of caves rich in fossils, and a beautiful, unspoiled natural environment typical of temperate rainforests, it is one of the most striking places of the Kahurangi National Park. The Oparara Basin is also famous for its unique remains in paleozoology and for being the sole habitat of several plant and animal species. 180¬∞ panoramic view of the Oparara Basin from the access road History With its natural environment relatively closed and isolated, the Oparara Basin has long been protected from human influence. However, the locations of natural rock arches have been indicated in maps as early as from the 1880s. Logging of native timber in the area started in the late 19th century, with the building of the McCallum's sawmill. As the logging areas progressed to be further away from the sawmill, it became necessary to build an access road into the rugged environment.Report of Commission on the Timber and Timber-Building Industries (from the National Library of New Zealand website. Accessed 2013-09-16.) Eventually, maintenance costs and extensions of this road escalated, and after changes of ownership and a belated attempt at reforestation, the sawmill went bankrupt. Selective logging continued in the forest until it was banned in 2002. At the time of the bankruptcy, a major campaign was launched to ensure the protection and enhancement of the basin, as well as road maintenance, culminating in the founding of the Oparara Valley Project Trust and the purchase of the area on 1 October 2004.History of the Oparara Basin (from Oparara Trust web site. Accessed 2013-09-16.) Miners and deer hunters have often reported spectacular rock formations in the Honeycomb Hill area, but it was not until an exploration of the Buller Caving Group in the 1980s that an inventory of the 70 entrances to 13 km of galleries located in the Honeycomb Hill Cave system was compiled. These explorations revealed the scientific significance of the cave system by discovering the largest collection of bird fossils ever found in New Zealand. A six-year project to complete a 30 km network of walkways and mountain biking tracks was completed in 2009, opening up more of the Oparara Basin to tourists who would have originally only visited the Heaphy Track.West Coast locals open up native forest and caves to visitors (from 3 News website. Accessed 2013-09-16.) Several placenames in the area are inspired by The Lord of the Rings, such as Galadriel Creek, Nimrodel Creek, and Moria Gate Arch. Geology and climate The Oparara Basin resides on a foundation of 350 million year old granite, which was covered with a 15-60m thin layer of limestone approximately 35 million years ago. The surface layer consists of blue-grey mudstone. The limestone layer has been extensively eroded by annual rainfall of up to 6m and the roots of the lush vegetation. Tectonic activity as well as changes in the level of the nearby sea have supported the appearance of unique geological formations. The basin currently contains many of the typical features found in a karst landscape, as well as some impressive rock arches and caves, and sites rich in limestone fossils. Moa skeleton in Honeycomb Hill Cave Fauna of the past The Oparara Basin is famous for its unique remains in paleozoology. The Honeycomb Hill Cave area was discovered in 1976 and in 1982 was given the status of a site of global significance in paleozoology due to discoveries of bones of several species that had gone extinct upon human settlement. In 1984, the first systematic discovery campaign led to finds of the bones of fifty birds, most of which were extinct species. The first and most complete bones of the Haast's eagle were found here, now on display at the National Museum of New Zealand in Wellington. Further finds included skeletons of Lyall's wren, New Zealand owlet-nightjar, Aptornis otidiformis, and nine different species of moa, whose skeletons are visible in the caves. Bones of amphibians and lizards, as well as the remains of about 40 different species of snails have also been found. The wealth of intact bones and skeletons is explained by the fact that the holes in the limestone could trap bones, protect them from heavy rains and preserve them for long periods of time due to constant thermal conditions and the chemical similarity of bones and limestone. Intact skeletons older than 20,000 years have been discovered. In 2008, the Kahurangi National Park was expanded by an additional 10 hectares to complete the protection of the Honeycomb Hill Cave system. Honeycomb Hill Cave is in a restricted area, with access permitted by permit only. The Oparara Trust has a concession from the Department of Conservation to provide guided tours of the area. Today's fauna and flora Nowadays this basin is an important habitat of many endemic species, some of which are endangered or unique to the area. The Oparara Basin is the only place where the snails Powelliphanta marchanti and Powelliphanta annectens have been found. The former is strictly protected, with even the collection of empty shells prohibited, while the latter has only been found in areas around 700m from the Oparara River. The spiders Oparara karamea and Oparara vallus are also endemic to the area, while the caves are home to the protected Nelson cave spider, glowworms, and the New Zealand greater short-tailed bat. The Oparara Basin is also a habitat of the blue duck, great spotted kiwi, both classified as endangered species, as well as the endemic kea, weka, New Zealand falcon, and paradise shelduck. Most of the area is covered in mixed beech and podocarp forest. The forest floor consists of a thick carpet of mosses, ferns, and understorey plants. Due to the sometimes shallow soil, these plants often have to squeeze their root systems through cracks in the limestone to gain a hold, furthering the erosion of the limestone layer. The very rare moss Epipterygium opararense has been named after the area and grows near the entrances of arches and caves in the Oparara Basin. Despite meticulous research, only 175 plants have been found near a tramping pathFife & Shaw 1990: 375 Several of the plant species in the area release tannins into the water upon the decomposition of their vegetation. This colours the waters of the streams and rivers in the area a brown to red tea-like hue, depending on season and rainfall.

Construction was started in 1914 and the shed was commissioned in 1920 for James Nutter & Sons Limited. The mill closed on 22 December 1978 and was demolished. The engine house, chimneys and boilers have been preserved and maintained as a working steam museum. The mill was the last steam-driven weaving shed to be constructed and the last to close. The engine house is open to visitors and the William Roberts cross compound 600hp engine regularly runs from steam generated from donated wood.  Location  Bancroft Shed was the last weaving shed to be built in Barnoldswick, which had twelve others. It is midway between Burnley and Skipton and north of Manchester, in altitude in the Pennine hills. In 1920 this industrial town had a population of 10,000 people and there were 24,000 looms. Historically in Yorkshire, in 1974 Barnoldswick and a number of surrounding villages were transferred to the Borough of Pendle in the Non-metropolitan county of Lancashire as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. The town is located on the edge of the Yorkshire wool district and the Lancashire cotton weaving district.  History  James Nutter had space at Calf Hall Shed, a room and power mill, while his mill was built. His mill was designed by W M Atkins of Colne in 1914, but construction was suspended because of the Great War. The weaving shed was completed in 1920 and the opening ceremony was performed in March 1920. About 50 Lancashire looms were installed and weavers from Calf Hall were brought in on a standard wage to loom-in. In 1920, most four-loom weavers were on piece work and were expected to weave six pieces each of a week for 6s each. Bedding in a new shed was too problematic, however, to rely on piece work wages, so a standard wage was paid. When all the looms were installed and everything was running six weeks later, the company reverted to the Uniform List of Weaving Prices. The shed opened with part of the first double row of looms closest to the warehouse, eventually 80 pairs of looms on this row ran from one cross shaft. Eventually there were 19 cross shafts. Opening in 1920, Bancroft Shed missed the profitable years. During the Great War, Britain lost much of its export market, and only the most specialised weaving sheds survived. More looms system Increased efficiency was sought, four-loom weavers were encouraged to work six or more looms. This was the more looms system, which reduced the number of weavers required. The looms were slowed from 220 picks per minute to 180 by changing the diameter of the pulleys. Elsewhere this caused industrial action, but here management maintained the four loom system in most of the mill. Additional power was required in the 1940s and a supplementary Cornish boiler was installed. In 1935, 450 people were working at the mill running 1,152 looms for 50 hours a week making of grey cloth. During the 1939‚Äì45 war, many empty weaving sheds in Lancashire were requisitioned; Rover and Rolls Royce moved into Barnoldswick. An extra layer of management was imposed on the industry when the Cotton Control Board was set up by the Board of Trade. Labour and all resources were rationed. James Nutter took action to close his businesses at Grove Mill and Westfield Shed and moved his looms into storage at Bancroft. This reduced his operable looms to 500 at exactly the time he was required by the Cotton Control Board to reduce output to 40%. While other firms collapsed, Nutters wove throughout the war. From a high point of 808,797 looms nationally in 1915, the numbers had fallen to 530,000 in 1939 and plummeted to 220,000 in 1941 rising marginally to 355,500 in 1949. Under Board of Trade control, working conditions for the weavers improved and the average wage increased from 31s 5d to 78s 0d. On 19 August 1941 a minimum wage agreement was signed. The existence of aero-engine manufacturers in the town provided alternative employment in cleaner conditions. When the war ended weavers expected better working conditions, but the more looms system became almost universal. Bancroft weavers worked eight-loom sets, then ten sets. Tacklers' sets were reduced from 140 to 70 to cope with extra work. Conditions eased in the 1950s, mill lighting was changed from 110 V DC to 250 V AC. Mechanical Proctor coking stokers were fitted to the Lancashire boiler. The looms were re-spaced into ten sets with a separating alley, though a row of eight sets was retained as a \\"Pensioner Side\\". Opinion varied as whether a ten set produced as much cloth as an eight set run by an experienced weaver. In 1976 production consisted of contract weaving and part warps. Experienced weavers and tacklers recognised that demand was drying up and left. In September 1978 closure was announced. The mill struggled until 22 December when it finally closed. Demolition began the following year.  Mill   Architecture  The layout of Bancroft Shed in 1955 The mill consisted of a two-storey warehouse, a boiler room and engine shed with a large single-storey weaving shed. On closure in 1979, the warehouse and weaving shed were demolished. A chimney was situated to the west and a by lodge to the south. Following demolition of the shed, the lodge was filled in and the line of the road altered. The large Lancashire boiler is kept full of water from the roof gutters, and is used in the condenser (under the engine) and as feed water for the Cornish boiler. As originally built, the weaving shed was about by , set into the hillside with typical north facing roof lights to provide natural light, it housed 1200 looms. On the west side was the boiler room and engine house, and the warehouse was to the south. The ground floor was the warehouse and the upper floor was for preparation, sizing, drawing in and winding.  Power  Steam was raised by a Lancashire boiler and in 1947, when the warehouse needed extra steam for sizing, a Cornish boiler was added but disconnected in 1948 because of problems sharing the same flue. A Green's economiser preheated the feedwater. The boiler was stoked manually, until a Proctor automatic stoker was fitted in the 1930s. Steam was raised to 160 psi. On closure in 1979, the Lancashire boiler required work, and the Cornish boiler that had been unused for 30 years was renovated, fired up and certificated. It is steamed at 50 psi, powered by donated scrap wood, to drive the engine on Heritage Steam Days.UK Heritage Hub Issue 20 19 April 2013 Bancroft Mill Engine Museum - Part 6 HARRY MOORE. C. ENG. As this was a single boiler shed, it has a chimney to provide the pressure difference needed to draw the air into the boiler. The Bancroft chimney was repaired and 'banded' by Fred Dibnah in 1997. The Bancroft mill engine is a horizontal cross compound Corliss valve condensing steam engine built 1914 and installed by William Roberts of Nelson in 1920. As was traditional, the cylinders were named, the high-pressure cylinder \\"James\\", and the low-pressure \\"Mary Jane\\". Together they were rated to at 600 ihp, enough for 1200 0.5 hp looms, the rating was conservative and the engine could deliver more power if needed. Its speed is 68 rpm controlled by a Porter type governor and a Lumb regulator acting on the high-pressure cylinder valves and Dobson-type trip gear is fitted. The high-pressure cylinder (HP) has a bore and the low-pressure (LP) ; both have a stroke of . It uses Corliss valves. The engine drives a diameter flywheel running at 68 rpm, with an diameter second motion wheel running at 136 rpm. The flywheel is grooved for 13 cotton ropes which are preserved with a dressing of tallow and graphite. The second motion wheel drives the lineshaft which ran for to the back of the weaving shed. =Gallery= File:Cornish boiler, Bancroft Mill - geograph.org.uk - 1624951.jpgThe Cornish boiler File:Bancroft Mill, economiser and engine - geograph.org.uk - 1627652.jpgThe telltale chains and wheels of an economiser File:Bancroft Mill engine at speed - geograph.org.uk - 680971.jpgBancroft Mill Engine running without load on 50 psi File:Barnoldswick - Bancroft Shed Engine House - geograph.org.uk - 531165.jpgThe low pressure \\"Mary Jane\\" engine File:Chimney, Bancroft Mill - geograph.org.uk - 1343942.jpgThe tall chimney, brick with oversailing caps  Weaving equipment  When yarn enters a weaving mill on different-sized cops and cheeses, it is rewound on to pirns to fit the shuttles used by the looms. Bancroft Shed bought its weft \\"shuttle ready\\" on pirns in 1920; there was no winding on site. Pirning was started and, in 1970, the mill used Britoba pirn winders. The pirns were carried in two types of shuttles. The original kissing shuttles caused health scares and were replaced by self-threading shuttles. Warp is taken from 300 bobbins on a V-shaped frame and wound onto a beam. Four or five beams are merged to make the 2000 end beam required, and placed in the Cylinder Tape Sizing Machine like ones made by Howard & Bullough Ltd. of Accrington. The threads pass through size to stiffen them and reduce friction. The size is a mixture of flour, soft soap and tallow: specific to the mill. The threads are dried over steam-heated cylinders and wound onto the weavers beam. The weavers beam is placed on a drawing-in frame, where each end is passed through the healds, and then through a reed. This job was done by a reacher-in and a loomer. The reacher-in, usually a young boy, passed each end in order to the loomer, who threaded it through the healds and reeds. The mill had two drawing-in frames. Alternatively, if the loom had already run that cloth, a short length of warp thread could be left on the healds and reed. A twister would knot the threads and draw it through. A Barber-Colman knotter could tie in warp threads to the new beam, much faster than a twister. This process took 20 minutes, considerably faster than starting afresh. The loomed weavers beam was taken into the weaving shed, where a weaver would tenter four Lancashire Looms working at 220 picks per minute. The beam was gaited to the loom and kept working by a tackler who tentered 130. With the More Looms system brought in after the second war, weavers tentered ten looms, but the tackler had a set of 70. =Gallery= File:Queen Street Mill - Beaming Frame - geograph.org.uk - 531481.jpgBobbins for beaming frame (at Queen Street Mill, Burnley) File:Queen Street Mill - Cylinder Sizing Machine - geograph.org.uk - 528575.jpgCylinder sizer (at Queen Street Mill, Burnley) File:Queen Street Mill - Drawing in or Looming Frame - geograph.org.uk - 528577.jpgDrawing-in frame (at Queen Street Mill, Burnley)  Bradley engine  In 1901 a Smith Bros. and Eastwood, was installed at Cross Lane Mill, Bradley, near Skipton, for cloth manufacturers Peter Green and Sons. The well-established company had a parent mill in the next village of Cononley. The new engine, replacing an earlier beam engine at the mill, went on to extend the life of the mill for another 77 years. Early in 2003 the mill premises were sold for development but an enthusiast was given ownership by the owner and permission to dismantle and remove the engine, and to find a new home for it. Without any under-cover storage forthcoming for the dismantled engine, the Bancroft Trust committee offered a large storeroom at Bancroft Mill, and the parts were transported there. The engine owner and the Trust produced a plan to re-assemble the engine at Bancroft, with the hope of eventually running it on steam. Unlike the Bancroft engine, the Bradley engine has a tandem configuration, with both cylinders in-line and with only one crank . An example of a northern-built engine with several novel features, and it is believed to be the sole surviving engine built by Smith Bros. & Eastwood, who were established in Bradford and ceased business in 1902. It has an overall length of and is housed in a large brick, stone and steel building, previously used as a store. To accommodate the engine, in 2006 the building was extended by approximately at the end nearest the chimney, the work being enabled by a grant of ¬£15,000 from the Lancashire Environmental Fund. Stone cladding was erected around the extension by Trust members. By April 2011 the foundations for the Bradley engine were completed and both main bed castings were installed and levelled. Anchors to tie the engine to its foundations were manufactured by Trust members and design work undertaken on replacement piston rod bearing/seals and bearing shells. The engine crankshaft is carried in bronze bearings, one on the bed casting and the other as an \\"outrigger\\". Both bearings, unusual in their design, were missing on arrival at Bancroft. The bearing on the bed is of 3-segment design which allowed adjustment in both the horizontal as vertical plane. The outrigger bearing uses only a bottom half=bronze insert whilst relying on flywheel weight, of about 8.8 tons, to hold the shaft in place. Cracking of the main bearing seat on the main casting and on each side of the casting have required stitching. Reassembly of the engine continued over the following years using only chains, pulley blocks, levers and jacks. A new steam pipe to the engine, from the Cornish Boiler, was installed, tested with steam, and lagged. The flywheel was eventually moved from its temporary home in the car park and was carefully aligned, one half at a time. An electric barring system was installed in May 2016 to enable slow turned of the engine under power to allow final checks and timing settings to be made. On 8 September 2017 the engine was finally returned to steam for the first time in 39 years. It can be seen running on the museum's steaming days.

Interested in understanding the region, he took an active part in developing French scientific research in West Africa in collaboration with the anthropologist Maurice Delafosse.  Biography  Fran√ßois Clozel was born on 29 March 1860 in Annonay, in the Ard√®che department. He graduated with a diploma in Arabic from the School of Oriental Languages. He completed his military service in a regiment of Zouaves in Algeria. He participated in the mission of Casimir Maistre to the French Congo in 1892. He led an expedition in 1894-95 in the north of this country. In 1896 he was sent to the Ivory Coast. From 25 November 1902 to 4 May 1903 he was acting governor, before being appointed governor on 19 November 1905. After a short interlude when Albert Anatole Nebout held office, he resumed his place as governor from 27 October 1906 to 25 April 1908. His name is associated with the construction of the railway in C√¥te d'Ivoire. On 18 February 1908, when William Merlaud-Ponty became Governor General of French West Africa, Fran√ßois Clozel replaced him as governor of the French Sudan. He was Acting Governor General of French West Africa from January to August 1912 under Ponty. On the death of the latter, he fully succeeded him, holding office from 14 June 1915 to 3 June 1917. Clozel was interested in the indigenous peoples, and encouraged his subordinates to study local customs. With a very different attitude from Ponty, he tried to establish cooperative relations with the African leaders. He was the author of several ethnographic studies, and in 1912 he directed the publication of a series of works by Maurice Delafosse entitled Haut S√©n√©gal-Niger, for which he wrote the preface. On 11 December 1915, he founded the Committee of Historical and Scientific Studies of French West Africa, of which Delafosse was a member. Clozel was the first governor to take into account ethnological research in his directives. Both in tone and in content, his circulars differ from the usual line of colonial administration. Captain Joost van Vollenhoven succeeded Clozel at the head of French West Africa on 3 June 1917. Fran√ßois Clozel died suddenly in Rabat on 10 May 1918. Clozel's tombstone, Christian cemetery, Rabat, Morocco  Legacy  An avenue in Cotonou, Benin, and a boulevard in the Plateau of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, now bear his name. On the square of the Dakar railway station is a monument dedicated in 1923 \\"to the creators of French West Africa and the glory of the black army\\". It has - in addition to statues of Demba and Dupont, and of Senegalese troops, medallions of Louis Faidherbe and four prestigious Governors: William Merlaud-Ponty, Joost van Vollenhoven, Fran√ßois Joseph Clozel and No√´l Ballay.

After gathering enough money to pay lobola, the couple married in the local Presbyterian Church. Together they had six children. In order to support his family Ngudle returned to Cape Town. Political history During the 1940s and 1950s Ngudle saw bulldozers demolished black-owned homes in Kensington, South Africa, to make way for a White-only neighbourhood. It was at this time, during the 1950s, that Ngudle joined the African National Congress (ANC). Ngudle's obligation was to raise funds. The funds were used for when ANC members were arrested and required a lawyer. He would often stage large jazz concerts with the local choir and musicians. During this time in order to still send support to his family, he partook in the making and selling of leftist newspapers such as Fighting Talk and New Age.

Common in Arabic before year 1000.A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval Arabic dictionaries are online at Baheth.info and/or AlWaraq.net. One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari's \\"Al-Sihah\\" which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is Ibn Manzur's \\"Lisan Al- Arab\\" which is dated 1290 but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources, including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, volume 1, page xxx (year 1863). Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon contains much of the main contents of the medieval Arabic dictionaries in English translation. At AlWaraq.net, in addition to searchable copies of medieval Arabic dictionaries, there are searchable copies of a large number of medieval Arabic texts on various subjects. Early records in European languages are at seaports in Italy and Catalonia. They include Latin garbellare = \\"to sift\\" in year 1191 sifting drugs and resins, Latin garbellus = \\"a sieve for sifting spices\\" in 1227, Latin garbellare sifting dyestuffs in 1269, Italian gherbellare = \\"to sift spices and drugs\\" in 1321.Regarding Italian-Latin garbellare meaning \\"to sift spices, drugs, dyes and resins\\", a set of examples at the port of Genoa in and around the 13th century is in the downloadable book Vocabolario Ligure, by Sergio Aprosio, year 2001 on page 419, including wordforms garbellatura, garbellus, etc. An example at the port of Marseille in Latin in the mid 13th century is at Du Cange. Examples at the port of Pisa in Italian in the early 14th century are at garbel @ Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini, including wordforms gherbellare (verb) and ghierbello (noun). Examples at the port of Valencia in Catalan in the early 14th century are at Ref, Ref, Ref, where the sifted materials were spices and dyes and the wordforms included garbellar  guarbellar  garbellada. In Italian with date around 1340 the word occurs more than two hundred times in a merchant's handbook, Francesco Pegolotti's La Pratica della Mercatura, where it comes up in the context of quality-control of spices, drugs, dyes, and resins, and is spelled both garbell__ and gherbell__. In Spanish there is a not-common garbillo = \\"sieve\\". It entered Spanish from the Catalan garbell. Its uncommonness in Spanish is shown by the CORDE Spanish text database, which does not have it in medieval Spanish, and rarely has it in post-medieval Spanish. One of the uncommon instances in Spanish in the CORDE database is in year 1509 in a translation to Spanish of a medicine book written in Italy in Latin by Theodoric of Lucca (died c. 1298), spelled in Spanish garbelladura. In German in 1420 there is gerbelieren = \\"to cleanse wares from impurities\\", clearly from the Italian gherbellare ‚Äì Raja Tazi 1998. French grabeler = \\"to sift spices or drugs\\" (1439) is understood to be from the Italian and Catalan and ultimately from the Arabic gharbal ‚Äì grabeler @ CNRTL.fr. From the medieval use contexts and the locations where the early Latinate records are found, the inference is made that the Arabic word entered Italian merchant vocabulary from the Mediterranean-wide sea-commerce in spices, drugs, colorants, and resins. For background information on such commerce by Italians in Arabic-speaking cities, Pegolotti is good. In addition to the Italian Maritime Republics, the Catalans based at Barcelona and Valencia were active in the Mediterranean-wide sea- commerce in the same way as the Italians ‚Äì Ref (spices on page 40). They begot English garbele = \\"to sift spices\\" starting 1393. In later-medieval Europe, pepper and ginger and other spice trade items were always imports from the Arabic-speaking Eastern Mediterranean, and the same goes for many botanical drugs (herbal medicines) and a few expensive colorants. The spices, drugs and colorants contained variable amounts of natural chaff residuals and occasionally contained unnatural added chaff. In England among the merchants of these products in late medieval and early post-medieval centuries, garble was a frequent word.In England around year 1400, either in English or in Anglo-Norman French, all of the following words referred to sifting removal of stalks and impurities from spices: garbel, garbelage, garbelen, garbelinge, garbalour, garbelure, garbellable, ungarbled ‚Äì Middle English Dictionary. For example in an Act of Parliament in 1439 applying to English ports where spices were offered for sale, any spices not \\"trewly and duely garbelyd and clensyd\\" were subject to \\"forfaiture of the said Spiceries so yfound ungarbelyd and unclensyd\\". Garbled meant that the parts of the spice plant that were not part of the spice were removed. Garble was also used as a noun for the refuse removed by garbling; e.g. in an Act of Parliament in 1603-04: \\"If any of the said Spices... shall be mixed with any Garbles...\\" ‚Äì ref: NED. The verb Garble has records in England starting from 1393 documented in the Middle English Dictionary at ref and ref. A Garbler or Garbelour, also 1393, was an official in the City of London who could enter a shop or warehouse to view spices and drugs, and garble them, to check them for compliance with rules against having cheaper stuff mixed in with them. Meanwhile, the early meaning of the English \\"garbage\\" (first known record 1422, in London) was the low-grade yet consumable parts of poultry such as the birds' heads, necks and gizzards ‚Äì ref: MED. Over the next two centuries \\"garbage\\" gradually came to mean the refuse parts of butchered animals ‚Äì ref: Lexicons of Early Modern English. In the early 18th century Nathan Bailey's English Dictionary defined garbage as \\"the entrails, etc., of cattle\\", and defined garble as \\"to cleanse from dross and dirt\\", and defined garbles as \\"the dust, soil or filth separated by garbling\\" ‚Äì ref. Nathan Bailey says the parent of garbage is garble (together with the suffix -age). Most dictionaries today disagree with Bailey. They say instead the parent of garbage is unknown. The influential New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1901) says the word garbage is \\"of obscure origin\\". To that dictionary's knowledge, however, the earliest record for garbage is 1430 and the earliest for garble is 1483 (ref: NED), which, if it were true, would imply that \\"garbage\\" existed in English prior to the arrival of garble. The fact that garble has records from 1393 makes it easier to believe that garbage probably or possibly came from garble. Sifting and culling was word's usual meaning in English until the 19th century and today's meaning grew out from it.English verb \\"garble\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1901). ;gauze : ŸÇÿ≤Ÿë qazz, silk of any kind ‚Äì this is uncertain as the source for the Western word, but etymology dictionaries are almost unanimous the source is probably from medieval Arabic somehow. The English is from late medieval French gaze, pronounced gazz  ga:z in French, meaning \\"high-quality lightweight fabric having an aspect of transparency\\" (very often silk but not necessarily silk). Al-qazz = \\"silk\\" was frequent in medieval Arabic, and it could be relatively easily transferred into the Latin languages because much of the silk of the medieval Latins was imported from Arabic lands. Other propositions involving other Arabic source-words for the French gaze have also been aired.In medieval Arabic al-qazz meant \\"silk\\" including \\"silk garment\\", \\"silk fabric\\", \\"silk yarn\\", and \\"raw silk\\", and it is a common word in medieval Arabic ‚Äì see ÿØŸÖŸÇÿ≥ AND ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≤Ÿë @ Baheth.info and ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≤Ÿë @ AlWaraq.net. Latin Gazzatum = \\"luxurious clothing\\" is in Latin in 1279 ‚Äì Du Cange. In medieval Latin that is a rare word and it looks foreign although the -atum part of it is a common Latin suffix. The Latin suffix -atum means \\"having properties characteristic of\\". So gazzatum clothing is clothing having properties of gazz (whatever gazz is). French gaze is pronounced like English gazz. French gaze has its first record in 1461 as man's robe made of gaze ‚Äì CNRTL.fr. In French in 1483 it is some kind of garment fabric and is spelled gaz ‚Äì DMF. In French in the later 16th century gaze was \\"high-quality light-weight fabric having transparency\\" (example: Cotgrave's French-English dictionary year 1611, where Cotgrave's English \\"tiffany\\" meant transparent silk). The French gaze is the parent of English gauze (1561), Spanish gasa (1611), German Gass (1649), German Gaze (1679), Italian garza (1704), Catalan gasa (1736) ‚Äì Raja Tazi, year 1998 page 201. Excepting small quantities, silk was not produced in Latin Europe until the 14th century. Instead almost all the silk fabric of the medieval Latins was imported from Byzantine and Arabic lands, pre-14th century; and importing continued in the 14th and 15th centuries ‚Äì \\"Silk in the Medieval World\\" by Anna Muthesius in The Cambridge History of Western Textiles (year 2003). Hence multiple mercantile routes existed by which an Arabic word for silk could have entered Western languages. A change from 'q' to 'g' in going from Arabic qazz to a Western gazz has parallels in other Arabic loanwords in the West, which are noted by Dozy year 1869 page 15, Devic year 1876 page 123, and Lammens year 1890 page xxvii - xxviii. In medieval Arabic there was also ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ≤Ÿë al-khazz = \\"silk fabric; half- silk fabric; fine fabric\\" and it was a commonly used word ‚Äì ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ≤Ÿë @ Baheth.info, ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ≤Ÿë @ AlWaraq.net, Lane's Lexicon page 731 ‚Äì and an Arabic 'kh' converted to a medieval Latin 'g' has parallels in Algorithm, Magazine, and Galingale. As a separate idea, some of today's dictionaries report that the late medieval French name gaze originated from the name of the Middle Eastern coastal town Gaza. This is an old idea which can be found in Gilles M√©nage's Dictionnaire √âtymologique year 1694. But the idea comes without supporting evidence, and comes lacking a fabric definition for the supposed exported fabric, and moreover the historical records are such that \\"the existence of a textile industry in medieval Gaza is not assured\\" ‚Äì CNRTL.fr. In the West the word has had varying sense over time, something it has in common with a number of other fabric names. A common explanation is that the word is derived from the city Gaza.https://www.britannica.com/topic/gauze ;gazelle : ÿ∫ÿ≤ÿßŸÑ ghazƒÅl, gazelle. Two species of gazelle are native in the Middle East. The word's earliest known record in the West is in early 12th-century Latin as gazela in a book about the First Crusade by Albert of Aix.More details at CNRTL.fr Etymologie in French language. Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales (CNRTL) is a division of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Another early record is in late 12th-century French as gacele in a book about the Third Crusade by Ambroise of Normandy. Another is in late 13th- century French as gazel in a book about the Seventh Crusade by Jean de Joinville. ;gerbil, jerboa, gundi, jird : These are four classes of rodents native to desert or semi-desert environments in North Africa and Asia, and not found natively in Europe. Jerboa is a 17th-century European borrowing of Arabic Ÿäÿ±ÿ®Ÿàÿπ yarb≈´ øa = \\"jerboa\\". Early-19th-century European naturalists created \\"gerbil\\" as a Latinate diminutive of the word jerboa.Book, Addenda au FEW XIX (Orientalia), by Raymond Arveiller, year 1999, on pages 132-134 for jerboa  gerboa  gerbo and gerbil. Gerbil is a diminutive of gerbo, and gerbo came from jerboa in the 18th century. ŸÇŸÜÿØŸä qundƒ´ = gundi, 18th-century European borrowing ÿ¨ÿ±ÿØ jird = jird, 18th-century European borrowingThe word Jird is rare in the European languages until the 20th century. One early record is the following English from Travels, or, Observations Relating to Several Parts of Barbary and the Levant, by Thomas Shaw, year 1738 (and translated to French 1743): \\"The Jird and the Jerboa are two little harmless animals which burrow in the ground.... All the legs of the Jird are nearly of the same length, with each of them five toes; whereas the fore-feet of the Barbary Jerboa are very short and armed only with three.\\" ;ghoul : ÿ∫ŸàŸÑ gh≈´l, ghoul. Ghouls are a well-known part of Arabic folklore. The word's first appearance in the West was in an Arabic-to-French translation of the 1001 Arabian Nights tales in 1712. Its first appearance in English was in a popular novel, Vathek, an Arabian Tale by William Beckford, in 1786.\\"Ghoul\\" in NED (year 1900). Ghouls appear in English translations of the 1001 Arabian Nights tales in the 19th century. ;giraffe : ÿ≤ÿ±ÿßŸÅÿ© zarƒÅfa, giraffe. The giraffe and its distinctiveness was discussed by medieval Arabic writers including Al- Jahiz (died 868) and Al-Masudi (died 956).Al-Masudi's 10th-century Arabic, together with modern French translation, is online in chapter 33 of Al- Masudi's Prairies d'Or. The earliest records of the transfer of the Arabic word to the West are in Italian in the second half of the 13th century, a time at which a few giraffes were brought to the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples from a zoo in Cairo, Egypt.Book The Giraffe in History and Art by Berthold Laufer (year 1928), chapter headed \\"The Giraffe among the Arabs and Persians\\" and chapter headed \\"The Giraffe in the Middle Ages\\". H ;haboob (type of sandstorm) : Ÿáÿ®Ÿàÿ® hab≈´b, gale wind. The English means a dense, short-lived, desert sandstorm created by an air downburst. Year 1897 first known use in English. ;harem :ÿ≠ÿ±ŸäŸÖ harƒ´m, women's quarters in a large household. The Arabic root-word means \\"forbidden\\" and thus the word had a connotation of a place where men were forbidden. (Crossref Persian and Urdu Zenana for semantics.) 17th-century English entered English through Turkish, where the meaning was closer to what the English is. In Arabic today harƒ´m means womenkind in general. ;hashish : ÿ≠ÿ¥Ÿäÿ¥ hashƒ´sh, hashish. Hashƒ´sh in Arabic has the literal meaning \\"dried herb\\" and \\"rough grass\\". It also means hemp grown for textile fiber. Its earliest record as a nickname for cannabis drug is in 12th- or 13th-century Arabic.Book The Herb: Hashish versus medieval Muslim society, by Franz Rosenthal, year 1971, pages 41‚Äì45. In English in a traveller's report from Egypt in 1598 it is found in the form \\"assis\\". The word is rare in English until the 19th century. The wordform in English today dates from the early 19th century.\\"Hashish\\" in NED (year 1901). ;henna, alkanet, alkannin, Alkanna : ÿ≠ŸÜŸëÿßÿ° hinnƒÅ, henna. Henna is a reddish natural dye made from the leaves of Lawsonia inermis. The English dates from about 1600 and came directly from Arabic through English-language travellers reports from the Middle East.Henne pronounced hen-ne and meaning henna is in Latin in the 13th and 14th centuries ‚Äì ref, ref. But it is rare in medieval Latin ‚Äì ref, ref. The word is not on record in French until 1541 and English until c. 1600. Today's English dictionaries report that the English was borrowed directly from Arabic hinnƒÅ, because the early English records are in travelers' reports and generally do not conform well to the Latin spelling ‚Äì ref: NED. Henna was in use in the Mediterranean region from antiquity and the name for henna in classical Latin was cyprus (kupros in ancient Greek). Alkanet dye is a reddish natural dye made from the roots of Alkanna tinctoria and this word is 14th- century English, with a Romance-language diminutive suffix '-et', from medieval Latin alcanna meaning both \\"henna\\" and \\"alkanet\\", from Arabic al- hinnƒÅ meaning henna.The active dye chemical in both alkanet and henna is a naphthoquinone derivative (alkannin in alkanet, lawsone in henna) and the two dyes are similar in several ways. The name alcanna  alchanna = \\"alkanet dye\\" has late medieval records in Latin, and some Romance languages, and English. Examples from 14th- and 15th-century English are in the MED. The same word alcanna  alchanna was also in use in late medieval Latin meaning \\"henna\\". An example noted by Raja Tazi (year 1998) is that in Gerard of Cremona's Arabic- to-Latin translation of Ibn Sina's Canon of Medicine, Ibn Sina's Arabic hinnƒÅ was translated to Latin alcanna. An example of the Latin spelling alchana meaning henna is in Simon of Genoa's medical dictionary, dated late 13th century. In the Arabic alphabet there are two letters h, one like a Latin and English h, and the other with a stronger sound, and the h of al-hinnƒÅ is the strongly pronounced one, which helps explain why it got rendered as 'ch' or 'c' in Latin (the same rendering is seen in the medieval Latin wordform Machometus  Macometus meaning the Prophet Mahommed ‚Äì Ref). The rendering most likely originated in Italy. In Italy in Latin, and Italian, if it had been rendered as hanna there would have been much tendency to pronounce it \\"anna\\" (still true in Italian today). The often weak and disappearing pronunciation of the sound /h/ in Latin, especially in Italy, is an aspect of Latin pronunciation (the sounds of Latin). Medieval Italian had alcan[n]a = \\"henna\\" + \\"alkanet\\" ‚Äì TLIO. Medieval Catalan had alquena = \\"henna\\" ‚Äì Vocabulario del Comercio Medieval. This was not in Spanish, where the form was alhe√±a  alfe√±a = \\"henna\\". Medieval Spanish has practically no example where an Arabic letter h got converted in Spanish to Spanish 'c' or /k/ sound (examples come from Catalan) ‚Äì ref: Dozy 1869 and Steiger 1932. And medieval Spanish has no records of alcana or alcaneta meaning henna or alkanet ‚Äì Dozy 1869 and Ma√≠llo Salgado 1998 and Corriente 2008. The alkanet dye plant Alkanna tinctoria was in use in the Mediterranean region as a dye since antiquity (was called anchusa in classical Latin). In medieval Arabic it had several names, none related to al-hinnƒÅ ‚Äì see ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸÜÿ¨ÿßÿ± @ Baheth.info and e.g., e.g.. ;hookah (water pipe for smoking): ÿ≠ŸÇŸëÿ© huqqa, pot or jar or round container. The word arrived in English from India in the 2nd half of the 18th century meaning hookah.\\"Hookah\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. The Indian word was from Persian, and the Persian was from Arabic, but the Arabic source- word did not mean hookah, although the word re-entered Arabic later on meaning hookah. ;hummus (food recipe): ÿ≠ŸÖŸëÿµ himmas, chickpea(s). Chickpeas in medieval Arabic were called himmas and were a frequently eaten food item.Book Medieval Arab Cookery: Essays and Translations, by M. Rodinson, A.J. Arberry and C. Perry, year 2001. In the 19th century in Syria and Lebanon the word was commonly pronounced hommos.The Arabic dictionaries spell it \\"himmas\\" but the people pronounce it \\"hommos\\", said Henri Lammens, who lived in Beirut in the 19th century ‚Äì Remarques sur les mots fran√ßais d√©riv√©s de l'arabe, by Henri Lammens, year 1890, page 93. It was pronounced \\"homos\\" in Egypt in the 18th century ‚Äì Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica, by Peter Forskal, year 1775, page LXXI (in Latin). This was borrowed into Turkish as humus, and entered English from Turkish in the mid-20th century. The Turkish and English hummus means mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini and certain flavourings. In Arabic that is called himmas bil tahina. See also the list's Addendum for Middle Eastern cuisine words. J ;jar (food or drink container) : ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿëÿ© jarra, an earthenware jar, an upright container made of pottery. First records in English are in 1418 and 1421 as a container for olive oil.\\"Jar\\" in the Middle English Dictionary: a quote dated 1421. The same dictionary has another quote for \\"Jar\\" dated 1418. The jars hold olive oil in both of those cases. Jar was rare in English until the 17th century, and the 17th century English jar still had the primary meaning of a large earthenware jar holding imported olive oil (or less often other vegetable oil) used as fuel for oil-lamps. This can be seen from a search for jar  jarr  jarre  iar  iarre at Lexicons of Early Modern English (LEME). More on the early meaning of \\"Jar\\" in English is in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. Documents for Catalan jarra start in 1233, Spanish jarra in 1251, Italian iarra in 1280s.Gerra @ Dictionari.cat modern Catalan dictionary reports the first record of gerra in Catalan is in 1233 spelled jarra. Jarra @ Corpus Diacr√≥nico del Espa√±ol has its earliest record in Spanish in 1251. Iarra @ Girolamo Caracausi, year 1983 reports early records in southern and northern Italian in the 1280s. Arabic jarra is commonplace centuries earlier. For the medieval Arabic and Spanish word, and also for the word's early centuries of use in English, the typical jar was considerably bigger than the typical jar in English today. ;jasmine, jessamine, jasmone: Ÿäÿßÿ≥ŸÖŸäŸÜ yƒÅs(a)mƒ´n, jasmine. In medieval Arabic jasmine was well known. The word has an early record in the West in southern Italy in an Arabic-to-Latin book translation about year 1240 that mentions flower-oil extracted from jasmine flowers. In the West, the word was uncommon until the 16th century and the same goes for the plant itself (Jasminum officinale and its relatives).Jasmine is rare in late medieval Latin. In French it is not found until the early 16th century, except for one isolated instance in the 14th century as jasimin ‚Äì CNRTL.fr. Spanish and Catalan have their first instances in the 14th century while the earliest in Portuguese is about 1500 ‚Äì DEAF. It is in Italian in the 14th century in the form gelsomino ‚Äì TLIO. During the 16th century the plant became common in gardens in western Europe, including England. An English botany book in 1597 said correctly that the plant was unknown to the ancient Greek botanist Dioscorides ‚Äì Gerarde's Herball, 1597. The plant was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. In late medieval southern Italy the jasmine flower-oil was sold under a Latin name of the form sambacus  zambacca which was from Arabic zanbaq = \\"jasmine flower- oil\\"; crossref sambac. ;jerboa, jird: see gerbil ;jinn (mythology) : ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜŸë al- jinn, the jinn. The roles of jinns and ghouls in Arabic folklore are discussed by e.g. Al-Masudi (died 956). (The semantically related English genie is not derived from jinn, though it has been influenced by it through the 1001 Nights tales). ;julep (type of drink) : ÿ¨ŸÑÿßÿ® julƒÅb, rose water and a syrupy drink. Arabic was from Persian gulab = \\"rose water\\". In its early use in English it was a syrupy drink.\\"Julep\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. Similarly in An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, by Walter W. Skeat, year 1888. Like the words candy, sugar, and syrup, \\"julep\\" arrived in English in late medieval times in association with imports of cane sugar from Arabic-speaking lands. Like syrup, julep's early records in English are mostly in medicine writers. ;jumper (dress or pullover sweater) : ÿ¨ÿ®Ÿëÿ© jubba, an outer garment.Dictionnaire d√©taill√© des noms des v√™tements chez les Arabes, by Reinhart Dozy, year 1845. On pages 107 - 109 it quotes the garment word jubba from some medieval Arabic records. In Western languages the word is first seen in southern Italy in Latin in 1053 and 1101 as iuppa, meaning an expensive garment and made of silk, not otherwise described. Mid-12th-century Latin juppum and late-12th-century French jupe meant some kind of luxury jacket garment.All the Western languages in the late medieval period had iuppa  juppa as a kind of jacket. The earliest Western record, year 1053 southwestern Italy, just has iuppa named in a list of valuable goods at an abbey, with many of the other listed goods made of silk (text is online in Latin). The next earliest, year 1101 southeastern Italy, involves a gift of a silk iuppa (online in Latin). Other records of a somewhat early date in Latin, French and Italian include: instances where the juppa garment was banned or restricted at monasteries because it was considered too luxurious, instances where it was made of silk, instances where it was buttoned in front with jeweled buttons, instances where it was an item in a Last Will and Testament, instances where it was being worn on a battlefield, and instances where it was said to be worn by Muslims and made in Muslim lands ‚Äì refs: Jupa @ Du Cange (Latin J pronounced Y); Jupe @ Women's Costume in French Texts of the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries, by Eunice Rathbone Goddard, year 1927; Iuppa @ Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia, by Girolamo Caracausi, year 1983; Giubba @ TLIO. The earliest record in French is in a poem, Partonopeus de Blois, dated 1170-1188, in which a Christian princess is described as wearing \\"a purple-ish jupe well- made of Muslim workmanship\\" ‚Äì ref, ref, ref. The medieval jupe could be a man's or a woman's jacket. The style or shape of the jacket is not clear in its early records in Latin Europe but indications are it was short in length ‚Äì see Goddard 1927, above. In 14th and 15th century Europe the shape was like the pourpoint jacket (pictures of 14th century pourpoint) and the Doublet jacket. In English, the 14th-century ioupe  joupe, 15th-century iowpe  jowpe, 17th-century jup, juppe, and jump, 18th jupo and jump, 19th jump and jumper, all meant jacket.Examples in late medieval English are at Joupe @ The Middle English Dictionary; see also Jupon @ The Middle English Dictionary. Jupe continued in use in Scots English as late as the mid-19th century, meaning jacket, but in standard written English jupe became near-extinct or very rare about two centuries earlier ‚Äì ref: NED. In a German-to-English dictionary dated 1706 the German Joppe or Juppe was translated as standard English \\"a jupo, jacket, or jump\\" ‚Äì ref: Ernest Weekley. Bailey's English Dictionary in 1726 defined a jump as \\"a short coat; also a sort of bodice for women\\" ‚Äì ref. Webster's English Dictionary in 1828 defined a jump as \\"a kind of loose waistcoat worn by females\\" ‚Äì ref. Webster's English Dictionary in 1913 defined a jump as \\"a kind of loose jacket for men\\" ‚Äì ref ‚Äì and defined a jumper as \\"a loose upper garment; a sort of blouse worn by workmen over their ordinary dress to protect it\\" ‚Äì ref. New English Dictionary on Historical Principles published in 1901 defined a jumper in year 1901 as \\"a kind of loose outer jacket reaching to the hips, made of canvas, serge, coarse linen, etc., and worn by sailors, truckmen, etc.\\" ‚Äì ref: NED. That dictionary has more on jup, jupe, jump, and jumper as jackets. Most dictionaries say: jumper = \\"jacket\\" is from jump = \\"jacket\\" which is from jupo  jup = \\"jacket\\". Some dictionaries also say: the alteration from the older jup  jupe to the newer jump can have occurred through the influence of the unrelated common English word jump. Such an alteration ‚Äì where the less-common word becomes phonetically 'contaminated' by a somewhat-comparable more-common word ‚Äì is called assimilation by \\"folk etymology\\". Dictionaries reporting in favor of the ultimate ancestry of jumper in the medieval Arabic \\"jubba\\" include NED (1901), Weekley (1921), Klein (1966), Partridge (1966), Ayto (2005), Concise OED (2010), Collins English (2010), Webster's New World (2010), and American Heritage (2010), although some of these also flag the case as incompletely established. It is universally accepted that medieval English jupe descended from Arabic jubba but in the judgment of some dictionaries the descent of English jumper from English jupe is incompletely documented. Addendum for words that may or may not be of Arabic ancestry ;garbage : This English word is not found in bygone centuries in French or other languages. The early meaning in English was poultry entrails and its earliest known record in English is 1422. Its parentage is not clear. Some nouns formed by suffixing -age to verbs in late medieval English and not found in French: cartage (1305), leakage (1444 lecage), steerage (1399 sterage), stoppage (1465), towage (1327).As documented in the Middle English Dictionary (the \\"MED\\"). Garbage is arguably from English garble = \\"to sift\\" (first known record 1393), which clearly came to English through the Romance languages from Arabic gharbal = \\"to sift\\". The forms \\"garbellage\\" and \\"garblage\\" meaning the garbage or inferior material removed by sifting, are recorded spottily in English from the 14th through 18th centuries and those are clearly from garble. ;genet/genetta (nocturnal mammal) : Seen in 13th-century English, 13th-century French and Catalan, and 12th-century Portuguese. It is absent from medieval Arabic writings.Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais d√©riv√©s de l'arabe by R. Dozy & W.H. Engelmann. 430 pages. Published in 1869. Nevertheless, an oral dialectical Maghrebi Arabic source for the European word has been suggested. ÿ¨ÿ±ŸÜŸäÿ∑ jarnait = \\"genet\\" is attested in the 19th century in Maghrebi dialect. But the absence of attestation in Arabic in any earlier century must make Arabic origin questionable. ;guitar : The name is ultimately descended from ancient Greek kithara, which was a plucked string musical instrument of the lyre type. Classical and medieval Latin had cithara as a lyre and more loosely a plucked string instrument. So did the medieval Romance languages. Cithara was pronounced \\"sitara\\". Cithara is unlikely to be the parent of the French quitarre (c. 1275), French guiterne (c. 1280), French kitaire (c. 1285), Italian chitarra (c. 1305; pronounced \\"kitarra\\"), and Spanish guitarra (1330‚Äì1343), each meaning a gittern type guitar.Dictionnaire √âtymologique de l'Ancien Fran√ßais (D√âAF) has records for the guitar word in French in the later 13th century with spellings quitarre, guiterne and kitaire. Early records in Italian and Spanish are cited in \\"Lute, Gittern, & Citole\\" by Crawford Young, a medieval history article published in A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music (year 2000). Chitarra appears in the Italian writer Dante at or before 1307 and another early record in Italian is around 1300 as chitarre in a poem entitled L'Intelligenza (which is online). Additional early records in Italian, dated 1313, 1324-28, and 1334, are at chitarra @ TLIO.ovi.cnr.it. Italian chitarre was pronounced ki-tar-re. Italian etymology dictionaries say the Italian word came directly from Greek kith√°ra ‚Äì e.g. Etimo.it. In Spanish the earliest reliably dated record of the guitar word is as guitarra in a poem entitled Libro de buen amor dated 1330-1343 (a note about dating issues concerning two other Spanish texts is at Ref). Spanish etymology dictionaries say the Spanish word originated in Spain from an unrecorded Andalusian Arabic qƒ´tƒÅra ‚Äì e.g. guitarra @ Diccionario RAE. But that claim by the Spanish etymology dictionaries has to be doubted for the reason that forms of the word have multiple records in France and Italy for many decades beforehand. That is, the chronology of the records clearly admits the possibility that guitarra entered Spanish from French and Italian. In France (the south of France particularly) and Italy from broadly around that time period there are many instances in which a word-initial /k/ sound got altered to a /g/ sound. Four examples that later ended up in English are \\"grease\\", \\"gourd\\", \\"gulf\\" and noun \\"grate\\" (whose etymologies are briefly summarized by English dictionaries and more details on them are given in French dictionaries at CNRTL, D√âAF, and DMF, plus Ducange). The reason it is unlikely: A change from ci- to any of qui-  gui-  ki-  chi- has almost no parallel change in form in other words within the Romance languages around that time; i.e., change from sound /s/ to sound /k/ or /g/ is a rarity. Hence the qui-  gui-  ki-  chi- form (which is essentially all one form) is believed to have been introduced from an external source. A minority of dictionaries report the external source was medieval Greek kith√°ra = \\"lyre, and more loosely a plucked string instrument\\", a common word in medieval Greek records. A majority of dictionaries report the external source was Arabic ŸÇŸäÿ™ÿßÿ±ÿ© qƒ´tƒÅra  ŸÉŸäÿ´ÿ±ÿ© kaƒ´thara, with the same meaning as the Greek. An Arabic name of roughly the form qƒ´tƒÅra  kaƒ´thƒÅr is extremely rare in medieval Arabic records, which undermines the idea that Arabic was the source.According to minority opinion, the word \\"guitar\\" does not have Arabic ancestry. The basis for this opinion is, firstly, the scantiness of records of such a name in medieval Arabic and the abundance of records for guitar-type instruments under other names in medieval Arabic; and, secondly, the medieval Greek kith√°ra (and medieval Latin cithara), meaning a plucked string instrument, has the potential to be a non-Arabic source for the French quitarre (c. 1275) and Italian chitarre (c. 1300); and, thirdly, the guitar word has numerous records in French and Italian for 50 years before it is on record in Spanish, which undermines an hypothesized route of transmission via Arabic Iberia. Among the experts with this opinion is Reinhart Dozy, who omits guitarra from his 1869 book Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais d√©riv√©s de l'arabe (Ref). Records of qƒ´tƒÅra  qƒ´thƒÅr are found in Arabic after guitar had become established in the Romance languages. Reinhart Dozy's 1881 book Supplement Aux Dictionnaires Arabes attributes the post-medieval Arabic qƒ´tƒÅra  qƒ´thƒÅr to borrowing from the Romance languages (Ref). Others with this minority opinion include Concise OED (2010), NED (1900), Henri Lammens (1890), Friedrich Diez (1864). The experts at CNRTL.fr do not have the minority opinion but they are unable to cite a medieval Arabic record of the form qƒ´tƒÅra  qƒ´thƒÅr. A couple of records do exist for a medieval Andalusian Arabic kaythara = \\"lyre or plucked string instrument\\". One of these is in an approximately 12th-century Latin-Arabic dictionary written in Spain by someone who was more proficient in Latin than Arabic: Glossarium Latino-Arabicum. The other too is in a Latin-Arabic dictionary written by a native Spanish speaker, estimated dated around 1300: Vocabulista in Arabico. Those two Latin dictionaries are not fully reliable about Arabic, and there is no record of kaythara in actual Arabic writers. Also the form kaythara, with a kay- or kai-, is relatively \\"unsuitable to be the immediate etymon of the Romance word\\" in Spain (qƒ´tƒÅra would be more suitable) ‚Äì F. Corriente year 2008 page 320 (see also F. Corriente year 1997). Several very large entirely Arabic dictionaries were written in medieval times (including the Lisan al-Arab which occupies 20 printed book volumes) and none of them has a word of the form kaythara  kƒ´thƒÅr  qƒ´tƒÅra  qƒ´thƒÅr  qithƒÅr etc. The geographer Al-Masudi (died 956) wrote about the musical instruments that were used by the medieval Greeks. He indicated that he had gotten his information from a certain medieval Greek informant. In that context, Al-Masudi wrote that ÿßŸÑŸÇŸäÿ´ÿßÿ±ÿ© al- qƒ´thƒÅra is a musical instrument with twelve strings used by the medieval Greeks ‚Äì Ref. Some manuscript copies of Al-Masudi's book have it mis-spelled ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ¥ÿßŸàÿ© al-qishƒÅwa, which is signalling that the transcriber was unacquainted with the word ‚Äì Ref. A book about musical instruments by Ibn Khordadbeh (died c. 912) has the same statement that ÿßŸÑŸÇŸäÿ´ÿßÿ±ÿ© al-qƒ´thƒÅra is an instrument of the medieval Greeks ‚Äì Ref. Other than stating it is an instrument of the Greeks, no such word is known in medieval Arabic. The proposition that the Western word descends via Spanish from Arabic is an old tradition that goes back to Gilles M√©nage's year 1670 Dictionnaire Etymologique (Ref) which for its evidence noted the presence of the word in 17th century Arabic ‚Äì but not in medieval Arabic. In medieval Greek kithara[s] was common as a name for a lyre and more loosely a plucked string instrument ‚Äì some examples are in the Suda compilation. Lute and tanbur on this list are descended from names that are common in medieval Arabic records for guitar-type musical instruments. ;hazard : Medieval French hasart  hasard  azard had the primary meaning of a game of dice and especially a game of dice where money was gambled. The early records are in northern French and the first is about year 1150 as hasart, with multiple records of hasart in northern France about year 1200, and Anglo- Norman hasart is in England before 1216,Hasart in the Anglo-Norman Dictionary, quoting from the text Le Petit Plet which is dated early 13th century before year 1216. The Anglo-Norman Dictionary also documents from before year 1216 Anglo-Norman hasardur = \\"person who plays the hasard dice game\\", and from circa 1240 Anglo-Norman hasardrie = \\"hazardry, i.e. hazarding money in the dice game called hazard\\". These records underscore that the root-word was well-established in Norman French before it started to show up in Italian (first known record c. 1250) or Spanish (first known record 1283). and Anglo- Norman has hasardur and hasardrie at and before 1240, which is followed by Italian a√ßar about 1250 with the same meaning as hasart  hasard,See azaro @ Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini (TLIO). Relatedly, Italian has zaroso = \\"hazardous\\" in 1304 (ref) where Italian -oso equals English -ous. and Italian-Latin azar(r)um and azardum later in the 13th century,Du Cange's Glossary of Medieval Latin. and Spanish azar starting around 1250,Azar at Corpus Diacr√≥nico del Espa√±ol of Real Academia Espa√±ola. and English hasard about 1300. According to its etymology summary in a number of today's dictionaries, the French word was descended through Spanish from an unattested Arabic oral dialectical az-zƒÅr  az-zahr = \\"the dice\\" ‚Äì but that is an extremely improbable proposition because that word has no record in Arabic with that meaning until the early 19th century.With regard to proposed ancestry of \\"hazard\\" in an Arabic az-zƒÅr  az-zahr meaning dice, Walter Skeat (1888) says the Arabic is \\"a word only found in the vulgar speech\\" in Arabic and that's why it's hard to establish it, but he believes Persian zar -> Arabic al-zar [equals Arabic az-zar] -> Spanish azar -> French hasard -> English hazard. The same judgment is made by today's Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Concise OED. The earliest known record of Arabic az-zar  az- zahr = \\"dice\\" is in the early 19th century in oral dialect in Egypt, whereas the Western azar  hasard = \\"game of dice; hazard\\" is in French, Italian, Spanish and English since the 12th and 13th centuries. Hence Ernest Weekley (1921) says Arabic \\"az-zahr (al-zahr) is a word of doubtful authority which may have been borrowed from Spanish azar or from Italian zara.\\" John Florio's year 1611 Italian-English dictionary has Italian zara = \\"dice\\" (ref) and Florio also has Italian azara = \\"hazard\\" (ref). Marcel Devic (1876) notes zahr may have entered Arabic post-medievally from Turkish zar = \\"dice\\". In year 1680, F. Mesgnien Meninski published a multi-volume dictionary of Turkish, Arabic and Persian. It lists ÿ≤ÿßÿ± zƒÅr = \\"dice\\" as a Turkish word, and Turkish only (and it does not have ÿ≤Ÿáÿ± zahr = \\"dice\\" in any of the three languages) ‚Äì ref. Dice is called zar in today's Azerbaijani, Armenian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, and Albanian, as well as Turkish. Thus the word is in all the languages of the former Ottoman Empire and has to have been for some centuries, while the Arabic zahr has not been in writing as a dice until the 19th century, and this goes to support a judgment that the word in Arabic is a late borrowing from Turkish. An alternative proposition, having the advantage of attestation in medieval Arabic, derives it from medieval Arabic Ÿäÿ≥ÿ± yasar = \\"playing at dice\\".The rootword Ÿäÿ≥ÿ± yasar = \\"playing at dice\\" and \\"gambling\\" is in the medieval Arabic dictionaries at Baheth.info. It is also in Richardson's 1852 Arabic‚ÄìEnglish dictionary (ref), though not in the Arabic dictionaries of today. The idea of deriving the medieval French hasart from the Arabic yasar is mentioned at Etymonline.com, CNRTL.fr, and Etymologiebank.nl. Conceivably this might have entered French through the Crusader States of the Levant. The French word is of obscure origin.

First, workers themselves are at risk of road traffic injury. Contributing factors include fatigue and long work hours, delivery pressures, distractions from mobile phones and other devices, lack of training to operate the assigned vehicle, vehicle defects, use of prescription and non-prescription medications, medical conditions, and poor journey planning. Death, disability, or injury of a family wage earner due to road traffic injury, in addition to causing emotional pain and suffering, creates economic hardship for the injured worker and family members that may persist well beyond the event itself. Employers are in a unique position because they can use the employer- employee relationship as leverage to complement and enforce government policies that require safety belt use, prohibit impaired driving, and prohibit mobile-phone use and other forms of distracted driving. Safe-driving policies implemented in the workplace can promote safer driving away from work. In addition, employers, as purchasers of large fleets of vehicles, can spur improvements in vehicle safety, and encourage development of road safety capacity and legislation in the local areas and countries in which they operate, thereby improving road safety for all. Research examining motor vehicle crashes has focused on topics such as driver fatigue, medical conditions, distracted driving, biomechanics, vehicle engineering, collision warning systems, stability control, naturalistic driving data and the potential relation these factors have on the crashes. Various interventions from researchers studying driver behaviours have focused on vehicle monitoring devices, seat belt controls, behaviour interventions and obeying safe driving practices. Crash data and data sources Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are consistently the leading cause of work-related fatalities in the U.S. A total of 8,173 workers died in work-related MVCs on public highways from 2003 to 2008, representing 24% of all work-related fatalities for the period. The annual average fatality rate was 0.9 deaths per 100,000 workers. Workers employed in the trucking industry accounted for the greatest number (2,320) and highest rate of highway transportation deaths (19.6 per 100,000 workers). Other U.S. industries with high fatality rates due to work-related MVCs were logging (11.7 per 100,000 workers), wholesale distribution of petroleum products (8.6), waste management (8.5), support activities for mining (7.9), and taxi and limousine services (6.8). The majority of work-related MVC fatalities occurred among occupants of trucks (67% of deaths), especially tractor-trailers (34% of deaths). Nearly half of all fatalities were collisions between two or more vehicles (49%), and 19% were non-collision incidents, especially jack-knifed trucks and overturned vehicles. These statistics include only drivers and passengers in motor vehicles; U.S. data do include MVCs occurring off public highways, as well as fatalities of pedestrian workers, but these are not presented here. However, U.S. data on work-related fatalities do not include motor vehicle crashes while commuting to or from work, nor do crash data systems for the general population identify commuting status. blind spots, around trucks and buses where crashes are more likely to occur. The source of the data discussed above is the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), a program managed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) with data provided by state agencies. CFOI is the most comprehensive surveillance system for work-related injury fatalities in the U.S. Multiple data sources are accessed to compile data, including death certificates, OSHA reports, workers‚Äô compensation reports, police reports, and media accounts. Cases are deemed to be work-related upon confirmation by two independent data sources. CFOI combines strong methods for case ascertainment with detailed information on worker demographics and company characteristics. However, because CFOI must capture information on all kinds of occupational fatalities, it provides little detail on circumstances and risk factors specific to MVCs. A national surveillance system based on police crash reports provides more detailed information on circumstances and contributing factors for fatal MVCs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) collects comprehensive data on the crash, the vehicle, the driver and other persons involved. However, FARS identifies work-related fatalities only through the death certificate, which often does not fully ascertain work-related fatalities. Nor does FARS categorize fatally injured workers by industry or occupation. U.S. data on nonfatal work-related crashes are limited. Through a sample survey of employers, the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII), BLS generates annual estimates of nonfatal occupational injuries by variables such as industry, source of injury (e.g., a motor vehicle), body part(s) injured, age, and median lost work days. SOII provides little incident-level detail that can help to guide MVC prevention initiatives. Further, because SOII does not cover certain worker groups such as agricultural workers on farms with fewer than 11 employees and the self-employed, it undoubtedly underestimates the number of work-related MVCs and other events. The operating environment for work-related road safety Workplace driving in the U.S. takes place in two distinct settings: the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulatory regime that covers large trucks and buses, and the unregulated operation of lighter-weight fleet or personal vehicles driven for work purposes. Regulations to promote safe operation of large trucks and buses have been part of U.S. Federal policy since the 1930s. Most recently, the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 assigned this regulatory responsibility to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation. Most of the large body of research on occupational road safety in the U.S. has focused on identifying and mitigating road risk for operators of large trucks and buses through behavioral, engineering, and management interventions. Light vehicles used for work, such as these pizza delivery cars, are not regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. In contrast, there is no corresponding body of regulations applicable to U.S. workers who operate motor vehicles other than large trucks or buses as part of their job duties: i.e., those who operate lighter vehicles that are employer-owned or leased, or those who drive personal vehicles for work purposes. It is true that at-work drivers are covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ‚Äúgeneral duty clause‚Äù, which requires that an employer provide ‚Äúemployment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees‚Äù. Further, OSHA has issued regulations covering limited aspects of mobile equipment operation in construction, logging, marine terminals, and agriculture. However, OSHA has not put in place regulations for operation of motor vehicles on public roadways that would cover a wide range of vehicles, drivers, and work situations. In general, the OSHA policy response to occupational risks of light vehicle operation has been carried out through voluntary initiatives, guidance documents and ad hoc advisory committees. Operation of lighter vehicles in the U.S. workplace is in effect governed by traffic laws, augmented by employer policies. In the U.S., laws related to mobile-phone use, safety belts, speed limits, age of licensure, and license renewal are the responsibility of individual states. Inconsistency from state to state can complicate road-safety management for organizations that operate in multiple states. Many employers, recognizing the substantial economic and human toll of MVCs on their organizations and their workers, have implemented organizational policies for road safety that exceed the requirements of traffic laws. In response to safety advocacy, public opinion, and increasing threats of costly litigation, U.S. employers are moving to ban text messaging or use of mobile phones while driving on organizational business. The U.S. DOT, the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety (NETS), and the National Safety Council (NSC) offer a variety of resources to assist organizations in formulating and implementing policies on text messaging and mobile phone use: sample policies, reviews of liability issues, results of company surveys on mobile phone policies, and guidance on policy implementation and enforcement. FMCSA has recently issued rules banning both text-messaging and the use of handheld mobile phones by operators of commercial motor vehicles (large trucks and buses). Distracted driving has become a chief concern in road safety, given the advent of mobile phone usage. The American Trucking Associations has published a comprehensive textbook on risk factors, proximal causes, and prevention of large/heavy truck crashes. Topics include the size and nature of the truck collision problem; safety research methods; driver, vehicle, and roadway risk factors; vehicle-based technologies; safety management and operations; regulations, enforcement, and compliance; and ‚Äúactive safety.‚Äù ‚ÄúActive safety‚Äù encompasses the many fleet- based safety practices that are beyond legal compliance requirements but which can dramatically enhance safety performance. The book emphasizes implementation of these practices within individual fleets, but they could also be disseminated through government-industry collaborations and alternative compliance approaches. In addition, OSHA recently implemented its first broad-based enforcement initiative related to motor vehicle safety on the topic of distracted driving. At the 2010 Distracted Driving Summit, former Secretary of Labor Hilda Sol√≠s announced that OSHA would focus on preventing distracted driving through education and partnerships, complemented by a new enforcement initiative. In her remarks, the Secretary stated: ‚ÄúWhen OSHA receives a credible complaint that an employer requires texting while driving or who organizes work so that texting is a practical necessity, we will investigate and where necessary issue citations and penalties to end this practice.‚Äù Research and surveillance studies Based on the premise that targeted interventions are the most effective means of preventing occupational fatalities, researchers in the United States have published a number of studies aimed at documenting risk factors for occupational MVCs in various occupations and industries. Because fatality risk is consistently highest in the truck transportation sector, the vast majority of U.S. literature on occupational road safety addresses known and hypothesized risk factors for truck drivers, including driver fatigue and hours of service, medical conditions, and use of mobile devices. In the U.S., a great deal of this research has been accomplished through partnerships between government agencies and government-supported research institutes housed at universities. Because U.S. regulation of occupational road safety is largely limited to the safety of large trucks and buses, these institutes have focused on providing the evidence base to support changes to the FMCSA safety regulations that cover these larger vehicles. Two research institutes that conduct much of the research on heavy-vehicle safety are the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI). UMTRI houses the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics. For many years, it has worked collaboratively with FMCSA and NHTSA to maintain the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents (TIFA) and Buses Involved in Fatal Accidents (BIFA) databases. Starting with cases identified in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) (the U.S. national database of road traffic fatalities based on police crash reports), UMTRI researchers collect detailed data on vehicle configuration, cargo type, hours of driving, and other variables. In addition, TIFA and BIFA data collection protocols are easily adapted to address emerging issues. Other strengths of the UMTRI program include vehicle engineering, crash avoidance systems such as collision warning systems and stability control, biomechanics, and risk factors such as distraction, fatigue, and medical conditions. With support and collaboration from U.S. DOT agencies, VTTI has developed strong expertise in the collection of analysis of naturalistic driving data, i.e., video and other data collected from instrumented vehicles operated by drivers over an extended period under normal driving conditions. VTTI has collected naturalistic driving data for passenger vehicles and for large trucks. Its research has influenced recent changes in FMCSA regulations that prohibit operators of large trucks and buses from engaging in text-messaging and using handheld mobile phones while driving. Other VTTI research based on naturalistic driving data has demonstrated that not all commercial vehicle drivers have an equal likelihood of experiencing ‚Äúsafety-critical events,‚Äù i.e., crashes, near-crashes, or high-risk events such as lane deviations. One example is that drivers classified as obese were significantly more likely to be rated as fatigued, to be involved in a safety-critical event, and to be involved in safety-critical events related to fatigue. Another naturalistic driving study of local and short-haul truck drivers found that 8 of the 42 drivers in the study accounted for 60% of the 77 safety-critical events documented. In progress at VTTI is a case-control study that seeks to differentiate commercial drivers who are involved in a crash from those who are not according to individual and organizational characteristics. This line of research has implications to improve trucking safety by identifying attributes of higher-risk individuals and implementing controls to monitor and improve their safety performance. It can also identify high-risk organizational attributes amenable to changes in safety management practices. Other U.S. studies have used injury and fatality to describe crash risk factors in worker groups perceived to be at high risk. Reports published in the last decade have addressed MVCs among law enforcement officers, home healthcare workers, workers operating agricultural equipment on public roadways, and workers in the mining sector. Intervention evaluations Researchers in the United States have undertaken field evaluations of in-vehicle devices that monitor driver behaviours and fuel consumption. Studies that tested the use of in-vehicle monitoring in emergency medical services (EMS) reported substantial improvements in driver behaviour through in-vehicle monitoring systems that gave drivers real-time feedback. The researchers reported that the technology demonstrated sustained cost savings in regards to vehicle maintenance and required minimal retraining of drivers. Another study of EMS drivers reported similar results and recommended gradual implementation of in-vehicle monitoring, with attention to defusing potential concerns regarding a punitive approach to corrective action. Another intervention study, conducted among U.S. and Canadian drivers, evaluated a device that prevents drivers from shifting vehicles into gear for up to 8 seconds unless safety belts are buckled. Participants were 101 commercial drivers who operated vans, pickups, and other light trucks. The driver could escape or avoid the delay by fastening his or her safety belt before shifting out of park. Unbelted participants experienced either a constant delay of 8 seconds, or a variable delay of 8 seconds on average. A 16-second delay was introduced for those U.S. drivers who did not show significant improvement. Safety belt use increased from 48% to 67% for U.S. drivers and from 54% to 74% for Canadian drivers. After the driver fastened his or her safety belt, it tended to remain fastened for the duration of the trip. Seat belt use by type of law in 2008. Few U.S. studies have assessed the effectiveness of initiatives intended to change occupational drivers‚Äô behaviours through management interventions. One exception is a series of related experimental studies conducted over many years by Ludwig and Geller among pizza delivery drivers. In the United States, these workers tend to be college-age and thus relatively inexperienced drivers. Drawing from principles of organizational and community psychology, Ludwig and Geller proposed that interventions should be applied in a multiple-level hierarchical fashion, beginning with low-cost, low-intensity interventions targeted at all drivers and proceeding to higher- intensity and more intrusive interventions for those who resisted initial interventions. They also hypothesized that an intervention's effectiveness depends on four variables: * Involvement: The higher the level of employee involvement, the greater the likelihood that social norms within the work group will change. * Peer support: Greater opportunities for interactions between workers will lead to individuals prompting one another to adopt the desired safety behaviour. * Response information: The more salient and timely is the feedback the worker receives, the greater is the likelihood he or she will act on this feedback. * External consequences: Stronger consequences, whether they come in the form of rewards for compliance or penalties for non- compliance, will be associated with stronger responses to the intervention. The studies conducted by Ludwig, Geller, and colleagues focused on inducing drivers to use safety belts and turn signals and to come to a complete stop at intersections. The interventions assessed in this research included awareness- raising, safety pledges, individual and group goal-setting (with goals assigned by managers or developed by workers), directives from management, and individual and group competitions for rewards. In general, the researchers found that high-involvement interventions were effective in changing the targeted behaviour, and that in some cases these also seemed to be associated with positive changes in other safe driving behaviours. In addition, individualized public feedback was more effective than generic feedback, and worked well for those who were initially non-compliant with low-level, non- intrusive interventions. When external consequences were discontinued, compliance was not sustained. The researchers recommended that organizations begin with low-intensity, low-cost interventions such as group meetings, signage, or other media, progressing to more intrusive interventions for those who fail to respond to low-level interventions. They also noted that those who comply initially can be enlisted as agents of change who can influence co- workers, family, and friends to drive safely. Governmental initiatives Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration The mission of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is to ensure the safe operation of large trucks and buses, primarily by promulgating and enforcing safety regulations. FMCSA also supports research and non-regulatory safety initiatives related to new technology, management practices, and driver behaviour. Examples of regulatory and non-regulatory FMCSA initiatives follow: * Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations: This body of regulations cover all aspects of large truck and bus operations in the United States: the commercial driver's license (CDL) program, oversight of companies that transport freight or passengers, transport of hazardous materials, conditions under which a vehicle or a driver may be disqualified, drug and alcohol testing, hours of service of drivers, use of mobile phones, vehicle markings, securing of cargo, and many others. * FMCSA Medical Program: This initiative aims to ensure that the physical qualifications of drivers reflect current clinical knowledge and practice. The program includes a National Register of Certified Medical Examiners to ensure quality, consistency, and accountability for the medical examination required to obtain a CDL. * Cross-border safety, inspection, and collision statistics are available, by their country of domicile, for registered intrastate and interstate motor carriers operating in the United States. Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) opened U.S. borders to motor carriers from Canada and Mexico and led to the development of initiatives to ensure that all carriers adhere to U.S. safety regulations. * ‚ÄúShare the Road Safely‚Äù aims to improve the knowledge of all highway users to minimize the likelihood of a collision with a large/heavy truck and reduce the consequence of those that do occur. * The Safety Belt Partnership is an initiative to increase use of safety belts among drivers of large trucks and buses through outreach, education, and research. Safety belt use increased from an estimated 48% in 2002 to 78% in 2010, and is moving toward belt-use levels for the general motoring population. * Safety is Good Business provides resources to help motor carriers better understand their business responsibilities under the regulations, as well as the economic benefits of safety, and offers tools to help companies improve their safety performance initiatives. * CMV Web-based Driving Tips is a collection of defensive driving tips focusing on common driving errors made by commercial vehicle drivers. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a road safety agency in the U.S. DOT with a wide range of responsibilities for vehicle safety and driver safety. Although NHTSA does not have special responsibilities related to occupational road safety, a number of its activities are relevant to occupational road safety. In the realm of vehicle safety, NHTSA promulgates the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which apply to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale or use in the United States. It also conducts crash tests of motor vehicles and publishes safety ratings for all makes and models based on these tests. These NHTSA manufacturing standards and crash tests are directly relevant to occupational road safety, as they influence the safety of vehicles available to U.S. organizations and provide information to guide selection of fleet vehicles. NHTSA has produced models and guidance on the economic burden of traffic crashes on employers. Because public and private employers in the U.S. generally subsidize at least a portion of health insurance premium costs for employees and their dependents, employers bear some of the costs of crashes involving employees and families away from work in addition to at-work crashes. Employers are also liable for damages awarded in the courts for crashes for which employees are found to be at fault. In 1998‚Äì2000, motor vehicle crash injuries occurring on and off the job were estimated to cost employers nearly US$60 billion annually. On average, a fatality occurring on the job cost a business over US$500,000 in direct and liability costs, and each nonfatal injury cost nearly $74,000 USDs. For on- and off-the-job crashes combined, the study estimated the cost of non-use of safety belts at more than $6 billion each year, and the cost of alcohol-related crashes at more than $9 billion each year. NHTSA has also used occupational fleet vehicles to pilot- test a new application of a technology-based intervention to increase safety- belt use. In this small pilot test, drivers who were unbelted experienced sustained haptic feedback to the gas pedal when they exceeded 25 miles per hour (mph). Although drivers could continue to drive unbelted and exceed 25 mph by pressing on the pedal harder, they needed to exert constant mental and physical effort to do so. Alternatively, they could buckle their safety belts to make the feedback disappear. The intervention was uniformly successful in inducing all drivers in the test to buckle their safety belts, showing the promise of this and similar interventions to improve the safety of vehicle fleets. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the U.S. Federal agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for prevention of all kinds of occupational injuries and illnesses. Over the past 10 to 15 years, NIOSH has devoted considerable effort to building its capacity for research and prevention activities related to occupational road safety. This has been accomplished through analysis and interpretation of injury and fatality data development of injury prevention resources, and research to advance prevention of MVCs and resulting injuries in high-risk populations. NIOSH seeks to effect change through a variety of mechanisms: communication of research results through the peer-reviewed literature and industry channels, safety information targeted to employers and workers, changes in government regulations, and development of voluntary consensus standards. In partnership with other Federal agencies and private-sector and non-governmental partners, NIOSH is engaged in a comprehensive program of research and prevention activities for preventing MVCs among emergency responders, including fire fighters and emergency medical services (EMS) workers. These activities encompass a program for investigations of fire fighter line-of-duty fatalities due to MVCs, which lead to comprehensive case reports that are disseminated throughout the fire service nationwide. NIOSH has also produced guidance documents on topics such as tanker-truck rollovers, safety at railroad crossings, and safety of pedestrian workers at incident sites. The risk of ambulance crashes affects workers in the cab and patient compartment, patients, and members of the public. In addition, NIOSH researchers are pursuing a line of research related to ambulance safety. In the U.S., an ambulance may be one of a number of vehicle body types, and there are no comprehensive safety standards that specify requirements for safety and crashworthiness. Of special concern is the safety of workers in the ambulance patient compartment, where work tasks are not compatible with the use of occupant restraints and where equipment and interior layout put workers at high risk of injury in the event of a crash. Sled and crash tests of ambulances conducted by NIOSH and partners show that retrofitting patient compartments with redesigned occupant restraints will allow EMS workers the level of mobility needed to care for patients and at the same time afford greater protection from injury than standard lap belts. NIOSH work in this area has led to development of new voluntary standards for crash-testing of ambulances. The research program has now expanded to address the full range of human-factors concerns about worker safety in ambulance patient compartment, with a number of other manufacturing standards and testing standards in progress. NIOSH has also conducted research on the health and safety of truck drivers. Taking advantage of existing expertise in anthropometry ‚Äì the measurement of body dimensions for the purpose of designing safer and more ergonomically efficient work environments ‚Äì NIOSH researchers conducted a nationally representative field survey of truck drivers using advanced digital body scanning and more traditional manual measurements of body dimensions. NIOSH researchers also assessed the driver's interface with the vehicle, measuring distances between the driver's hands and feet and vehicle control systems. Results from the anthropometric study and the in-cab measurements have been transferred to vehicle manufacturers, who will use them to design the next generation of truck cabs to better accommodate today's population of truck drivers. The safety implications of these design changes are many ‚Äì improved visibility for drivers, better control of the vehicle, improved safety-belt design, and reduced risk of chronic conditions such as low back pain. NIOSH is also engaged in global initiatives for occupational road safety as part of its mission to provide global leadership in occupational safety and health. NIOSH, with its partner agency the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, represents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United Nations (UN) Road Safety Collaboration, and provides input to UN resolutions and reports on road safety. NIOSH also provides technical assistance and exchanges information with international partners such as the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Transport Safety Council, and with government agencies and non-governmental organizations in the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Australia, Mexico, India, and other locations. National Transportation Safety Board The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent U.S. government agency charged with determining probable causes of transportation incidents in all modes of transportation through in-depth, on- scene investigations. Comprehensive reports of these investigations are available to the public. Based on its investigations, NTSB makes safety recommendations directed to those groups best-positioned to bring about change, in most cases the Federal government, states, or manufacturers. In recent years, NTSB has produced a number of motor vehicle crash reports with relevance to work-related road safety, including crashes of motorcoaches, large trucks, and 15-passenger vans. Presidential Executive Orders President Barack Obama speaking at the Department of Transportation, shown with Vice President Joe Biden and US Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood. U.S. Presidents have mandated certain road safety rules for the nearly 3 million civilian Federal employees in advance of these requirements being incorporated into basic road safety law. For example, in 1997, President Bill Clinton issued an Executive Order requiring all Federal employees to wear safety belts while on official business, and encouraging government contractors to follow suit. As of this writing, one U.S. state, New Hampshire, had no law requiring vehicle occupants to use safety belts, and several other states did not allow law enforcement officers to issue a citation for non-use of safety belts unless the motorist had committed a more serious infraction. In 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order prohibiting Federal employees from text-messaging while driving a government-provided vehicle, while driving a personal vehicle on official Government business, and at any time when using Government-supplied electronic equipment while driving. More than 30 states now prohibit text-messaging while driving. Occupational Safety and Health Administration As noted above, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has recently implemented a new enforcement directive around prohibition of text-messaging while driving. Although OSHA has few other regulations that address vehicle safety, it has built alliances with public and private groups to promote occupational road safety. One example is the ‚ÄúEvery Belt‚ÄìEvery Ride‚Äù initiative to encourage seat belt use among federal workers. The OSHA Web site also provides case studies of corporate fleet safety initiatives in the U.S., and guidance for employers produced in collaboration with NETS and NHTSA. Department of State The U.S. Department of State provides safe travel and driving advice for 209 countries. This includes general advice on road safety for U.S. citizens traveling abroad48 and country-specific information based on reports provided by U.S. embassies. Although this information is not designed specifically for the work environment, it is comprehensive and up-to-date, and could easily be adapted for use by organizations whose employees and contractors are expected to drive outside the United States. ANSI/ASSE Z15.1 The American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) spearheaded the development of the ANSI/ASSE Z15.1 standard, Safe Practices for Motor Vehicle Operations, an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) consensus standard for fleet safety targeted at organizations operating small- and medium-sized vehicles not covered by FMCSA regulations for large trucks and buses. The original standard covers the following topics: * Management, leadership, commitment, and administration * The importance of written policies covering general operating rules, safety belts, impaired driving, distracted driving, routing, and scheduling * Driver qualifications, management, training, and record keeping *Vehicle acquisition, modifications, equipment, inspection, checks, maintenance, and replacement criteria * Incident reporting, review, and analysis, including methods for calculating key performance indicators for vehicle safety * Sample policies for business and personal use of vehicles owned or leased by the company, business use of vehicles owned or leased by the employee, and use of rental vehicles In 2012, ANSI approved the first revisions to the standard, the majority of which address driver behavior and organizational policies: * Language that calls for employer policies to require employees in all seating positions to use safety belts * Language that places fatigue management in the realm of organizational responsibility as well as with the individual driver * A new section on journey management by the employer (e.g., evaluating whether work can be performed without road travel, planning routes to avoid road construction or congested areas, or allowing employees the option to stop for the night if they are fatigued) * Expanded information on distracted driving, including a sample employer policy as an appendix To date, ANSI/ASSE Z15.1 has not been formally evaluated with respect to its adoption by U.S. companies or its impact on road safety performance in organizations that have implemented it. However, like the United Kingdom's Driving at Work guidance on work- related road safety, ANSI/ASSE Z15.1 informs employers of core requirements for occupational road safety programs and has generated increased awareness of the need to manage occupational road risk. Network of Employers for Traffic Safety The Network of Employers for Traffic Safety (NETS) is a not-for- profit organization dedicated to improving the health and safety of employers, their families, and the community by preventing traffic crashes on and off the job. NETS was established more than 20 years ago with support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the premise that in addition to implementing road safety programs in the workforce, employers could exert a major influence on traffic safety in workers‚Äô families and communities. Throughout its history, NETS has been governed by a Board of Directors with representation from private sector employers and insurers as well as government agencies (ex officio). Originally, NETS worked primarily through a large network of state-based coordinators, many of whom were based in governors‚Äô highway safety offices. Today, due in part to declining resources at state level, NETS is active in only a few states, and its work is done primarily through its member companies and Board of Directors. Since its inception, NETS has delivered its signature road safety campaign, Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each day during the course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS's member services is the ‚ÄúSafety in Numbers‚Äù fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data). Crash test performed at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Vehicle Research Center. Other agencies and groups Other resources available from sources in the United States include: * National Safety Council (NSC): This not-for-profit organization has developed a number of products to support occupational road safety. One example is the ‚ÄúCell Phone Policy Kit‚Äù, which is designed to assist organizations in implementing policies and communicating them to employees. NSC provides other online road safety resources of value to employers; its road safety page links to resources on distracted driving, teen driving, and its employer road safety initiative ‚ÄúOur Driving Concern.‚Äù NSC also offers a comprehensive safety manual for use by organizational fleet managers, which contains numerous checklists and sample policies as well as articles on topics such as distracted driving. * Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS): IIHS conducts crash tests of motor vehicles manufactured for use in the U.S., the results of which can inform purchasing decisions by fleet owners. IIHS also provides current state-by- state information on road safety legislation related to safety belts, mobile phone use, text messaging, and graduated driver's licensing. * The Transportation Research Board (TRB), an arm of the National Academies, provides a forum for wide dissemination of academic research results related to occupational road safety. Its annual meeting attracts thousands of researchers from around the world, and outstanding papers from the meeting are published in the TRB peer-reviewed journal, the Transportation Research Record. To date, most of the research published through TRB has emphasized truck and bus safety, and this is reflected in the composition of relevant TRB standing committees. TRB also has a series of publications, the Commercial Truck and Bus Safety Synthesis Program, which produces succinct reviews of a wide range of health and safety topics such as driver wellness, fatigue management, driver selection, and management practices. * U.S. DOT initiative on distracted driving: Former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has made prevention of distracted driving a policy priority within the Department. National summits on the topic were held in 2009 and 2010, the second of which emphasized the role of employer policies in reducing distraction-related crashes. A variety of materials to encourage employer and employee involvement may be downloaded. See also *Michael H.

(September 12, 1812 ‚Äì December 11, 1892) was an Irish Benedictine monk, and later a titular abbot. He served as professor at the Urban College, curial official, and guide to prominent English-speaking visitors to Rome in the mid to late nineteenth century. Dom Smith was also the first pro-rector of the Pontifical North American College, the national college for American seminarians in Rome. He served as pro-rector before the arrival of the first rector, William McCloskey, in March 1860. Life Bernard Smith was born in County Cavan, Ireland on September 12, 1812. At the age of 22, he entered the Irish College in Rome, on October 10, 1834. He was ordained a secular priest on September 21, 1839, in Rome, for his home diocese of Kilmore. He won his Ph.D. in 1840 and S.T.D. with distinction. He left the Irish College on October 25, 1843. Feeling a call to religious life, Smith made his profession as a Benedictine monk of Monte Cassino on March 21, 1847. Because of the Sicilian revolution of 1848, however, he was forced as a British citizen to leave the monastery, which fell within the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. He was allowed to return to Rome, and from 1850 to 1855 he served as vice-rector of the Irish College. Around this time he was also named professor of dogmatic theology at the Urban College and consultor to the Sacred Congregation of the Index. He was also made consultor to the Oriental Congregation in 1862, to the Holy Office in 1874, and to the Propaganda Fide in 1880. He was readmitted to the monastic life in 1857 at St. Paul Outside the Walls, while residing at San Callisto in Trastevere. Eventually he became Roman procurator for the English and American Benedictine congregations, and Roman agent for at least 22 American dioceses and several American religious communities. It was in this semi-diplomatic capacity that Father Smith served as a guide to famous English-speaking visitors, including the future Edward VII of England, U.S. President Franklin Pierce, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. One of his briefest assignments was as pro-rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome. The college was founded on December 7, 1859, and Father Smith served in the place of Father William G. McCloskey, until March 3, 1860. Smith retired from his professorship at the Urban College in 1880. He was later made titular abbot of Polirone by Pope Leo XIII in late 1884 or early 1885.

Founded in 1977. it provided accommodation, facilities, and training to aspiring artists, particularly those marginalised by apartheid.  Historical context  CAP opened in 1977. in the midst of social and political turmoil. South Africa was then under the rule of apartheid, which enforced racial segregation, prioritising the needs of the white minority and marginalising the black and coloured majority. Among other laws enforcing segregation, the Group Areas Act of 1950 assigned people to live in different regions according to their race. Black and coloured individuals were relegated to townships outside the city centers, away from jobs and essential facilities. Black children were also subjected to the \\"Bantu\\" education system, which was far inferior to that offered to white children and trained black children for jobs as labourers and servants. In protest, thousands of students took to the streets on 16 June 1976. These protests were met with violent police retaliation, and many schoolchildren were killed. The period following the 1976 Soweto Uprisings saw a huge surge in community arts centers, largely related to \\"the burning social and political issues of the time.\\" The lack of adequate art education in schools, and the blatant refusal of the government to provide better, prompted community members to provide education and facilities independent of the systems already in place. Arts centers gave disadvantaged individuals the skills to interact with the national and international arts scene at a time when art was viewed as \\"an elite, white privilege beyond the control of the ordinary individual.\\" CAP's beginnings were also embedded in the rise of the Black Consciousness Movement, which encouraged self-reliance and self-determination among non-white communities. The movement also strove to combat the self-devaluation which resulted from the conditions of apartheid. \\"The native detested white society, but was envious of it. Realising that his own skin prevented him from ever attaining privilege, the native despised his own blackness.\\" To counter this, the Black Consciousness Movement encouraged personal dignity and pride in one's identity and culture. In 1977, Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, died after violent police interrogation. As a result of his high profile, news of his death drew national and international attention. Within the country, the Black Consciousness Movement was supported more vehemently than ever, including within the art scene. Globally, many became aware of the brutality of the apartheid regime and began to more actively fight it.  Mission  CAP was founded to provide accommodation, facilities, and training to artists, particularly those marginalised by apartheid. The training provided at CAP was meant to serve not only its members, but the larger community as well. The center was founded on the idea of \\"each one teach one\\" ‚Äì after an artist had been trained, they would take what they had learned back to their community to help empower the broader society. A large part of the work created at CAP was embedded in and served the struggle against apartheid. CAP is well known for its posters through the 1980s and early 1990s. \\"reclaiming public visual space through training people in producing posters.\\" Many of these advertised activism and attempted to mobilise the oppressed. However, the center's main aim was providing opportunity to all in a non-sectarian, multiracial space. CAP never aligned itself with a particular political party and quite a bit of the work produced at CAP did not pertain directly to the struggle, but spanned a wide range of themes. CAP activist Ishmael Moss explains, \\"It was not so much pressure on the art to \\"toe the line\\", rather we worked to give the people space.\\" Also, CAP distinguished itself as one of the few community arts centers which catered to all races, but was located in a white residential area rather than a township, drawing in liberal white artists as well as non-whites. Though it was not entirely without internal tension, CAP has been described as an \\"island outside the polarization in the rest of the country.\\" It focused less on directly combating existing apartheid institutions and more on creating new multiracial ones. It has been argued that this community itself, by its multiracial nature, served the anti-apartheid struggle just as well as the art intended to challenge segregation. The fight for equality \\"adopted its most literal expression as a fight for a political democracy in the production of protest posters; however even the ‚Äòmelting pot‚Äô of different races and ideas created at CAP enacted a democratic community in opposition to state segregation.\\" CAP aimed to provide a space for self-definition and healing, where \\"marginalized people could empower and humanize themselves through creativity.\\"  History  In 1976, lecturers from the University of Cape Town began two temporary projects, offering workshops to marginalised artists. While these were originally intended to be temporary projects, the enthusiastic response and demand for more workshops lead to the decision to open the more permanent Community Arts Project the following year. When CAP opened in 1977, it was housed at 17 Main Road in the Cape Town suburb of Mowbray. In its early years, it was very community driven, classes being formed in response to requests for them. In addition to the visual arts, CAP taught theatre, dance and music, and (while priority was given to the arts) the center also offered yoga and karate classes. While it catered mainly to adults, weekly children's classes were offered as well. In 1982, the Culture and Resistance Conference in Gaborone was attended by several members of CAP. The conference urged artists to use their skills to serve the communities around them. This marked the beginning of the increased politicisation of the center. The same year, CAP launched the Media Project, which produced silkscreen posters and was most closely associated with political activism. But the fine arts produced by the center also became increasingly directly political. Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s, CAP was much more of an anti-apartheid political figure. The South African Police \\"raided CAP four times in three months under emergency regulations, removing pamphlets, banners, photographs, diaries, and personal letters,\\". demonstrating the threat that the government perceived in the center. In the early 1900s, independent community arts centers around the country fell into financial crisis. During the reign of apartheid, when many political organisations were banned, community centers served as covers for more direct political action. With the fall of apartheid, many politically motivated foreign investors withdrew funds as their objectives were achieved. They no longer saw the centers as weapons against apartheid. They also believed that the newly elected ANC government would take over funding these centers. However, this was not necessarily the case. The government funded 40 new centers, but provided very little support to the ones in existence. The Community Arts Project was additionally affected by the enactment of the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) as defined by the South African Qualifications Authority, which defined standards that had to be achieved to grant qualification to learners. This did mean that artists training at CAP could now obtain widely recognised certification. However, it has been argued that the NQF's emphasis on the \\"scientific\\" methods of art didn't allow for as much exploration of theme which the center had previously focused on. Lionel Davis, a former facilitator at CAP said, \\"the problem with a qualification system for the arts is that the qualification does not make you an artist. Rather it is what you do with the space and resources you are provided with\\". Many people felt that CAP had \\"lost the vibrancy of a community centre\\". The bureaucracy of the system also added an additional obstacle to arts centers, particularly smaller ones. Despite the struggles experienced during the transition, CAP was able to make ends meet and continue to produce many artistic individuals, many of whom went on to become successful artists. It was \\"one of the few art centres which survived from the 1980s into the 21st century and continued to provide art education for numerous individuals despite the many obstacles and difficulties it faced over the years.\\" In 2004, the Community Arts Project and the Media Project officially merged to create the Arts and Media Access Centre. In 2008, the center was forced to close its doors, due to lack of funding.  The archive today  After the center closed its doors, the archive of its works lay dormant for several years. However, in 2012 the Center for Humanities Research at the University of the Western Cape reopened the archive and assembled an exhibition to be shown at the Iziko South African National Gallery. The exhibition, ‚ÄúUncontained: Opening the Community Arts Project archive,\\" was intended to reopen the archive and revitalise it in mainstream cultural history. The exhibition, like the archive as a whole, was largely 1980's anti-apartheid art, but also showed pieces with a large range of themes and subjects. The National Gallery website explains the exhibition is an ‚Äúopen-ended and complex narrative of human experience, imagination, and social and personal relations in the world of apartheid and in its aftermath\\". The exhibition was also accompanied by a book by the same title, which shows several of the works on display and pairs them with pieces of literature to create a more complex dialogue around the art and writing. The book gives some history of the center and includes curatorial essays from the organisers. The exhibition's catalogue essay explains: > On the one hand, the resistance works on the show are reminders of an era in > which artists responded to a crisis of the human condition resulting from > apartheid. On the other, these artworks offer us the possibility for > thinking about the post-apatheid present, given the dehumanizing legacy of > apartheid. In both respects, they invite a re-imagining of political society > in the face of unemployment, poverty, disease, unequal education, persistent > racial divisions and new class polarizations. These works therefore remind > us that the question of the human condition is still at the heart of > understanding post-apartheid society. They also draw attention to the > silence of cultural resistance in contemporary times. Today, substantial parts of the work that was produced at the center is housed at the University of Cape Town (Manuscripts and Archives) and at the University of the Western Cape (Mayibuye Centre and Centre for Humanities Research).

It is a former sheep grazing property on a pastoral lease abutting the Murray River and the Murray-Sunset National Park in the Mallee region of north-western Victoria, south-eastern Australia. History The station was established in 1849 by Edward Meade ('Ned') Bagot, son of Charles Hervey Bagot, a wealthy South Australian pastoralist and parliamentarian. Bagot first visited the area in late 1847 when he retrieved the body of his friend Fred Handcock, a fellow pastoralist who drowned nearby.‚Äô‚ÄôSouth Australian‚Äô‚Äô, 7 December 1847, p. 3. Bagot started by grazing cattle but soon switched to sheep, using riverboats on the Murray to transport the wool. The property was named after Ned, a shepherd on the property. In 1876 the lease was sold to Robert Barr Smith. In 1920 the lease was taken over by the Neds Corner Pastoral Company. In 1946 the lease was sold again to the Kidman Pastoral Company, owned by Sir Sidney Kidman. In 2002 it was purchased by the Trust for Nature to be managed for conservation. Description The reserve lies at the confluence of the arid and semi-arid zones. It contains strips of River Red Gum forest and Black Box floodplain woodlands along the Murray and its associated wetlands. Much of the rest of the property consists of flat alluvial plains with mallee woodlands, chenopod shrublands, semi-arid grasslands and ephemeral lignum wetlands.

An adherent of La Sape is known as a sapeur or, if female, as a sapeuse. The movement embodies the elegance in style and manners of colonial predecessor dandies. History La sape can be traced back to the period of colonialism in Africa, particularly in the cities of Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The noted musician Papa Wemba was an important supporter of La Sape in Congo A major influence on the Congolese elite, present during the 1920s (the so-called Roaring Twenties), was West African colonial workers who came to the Congo. These Bapopo or Coastmen, as they were called, served as inspiration for the Congolese elite \\"to combat ingrained charges of inferiority leveled at them\\" by French and Belgian colonialism. Young Congolese men took the style of their masters‚Äô and made it their own. In the historian Didier Gondola's essay titled \\"La Sape Exposed!: High Fashion Among Lower-Class Congolese\\", he says: The houseboys used their connections in France to acquire their clothing. According to Gondola, Camille Diata frontlined the sape movement in Brazzaville in the 1930s, but also had a deep influence in France. He was also part of L'Amicale, \\"a loosely organized anti-colonial movement,\\" formed in France in 1926 by the imaginative Congolese revolutionary Andr√© Matsoua. The organization mainly helped Africans new to Paris get settled in the city because they were not welcomed well by the French, facing imprisonment and deportation. By the time of Matsoua's death in 1942, his political developments gained prominence in the Congo and were \\"hijacked\\" by the Congolese intellectual elite. They not only adapted the fashion sense but also his anti-colonial views. This movement became a distinctly ethnic Bakongo and Balari one characterized by potent political symbolism and ideology that would manifest in postcolonial era. A Brazzaville sapeur being interviewed by Spanish filmmakers for the documentary: Dimanche √† Brazzaville (2010) The 1950s gave rise to the cosmopolitan, thus bringing prominence to the music scene. Nightclubs and beer halls made up the venues home to the music and young urbanites of the Congolese townships of Kinshasa and Brazzaville. During the postcolonial years, the unique dynamics of La Sape coalesced in 1960 when both Congos were granted independence. Economic chaos ensued and many were left jobless. This caused numerous Congolese people to move abroad to western cities like London and Paris. Since they were also not very welcome, La Sape acted as refuge for them to cope with European life. Papa Wemba, a Congolese musician, is credited with reviving la sape in Kinshasa during the 1970s by emphasizing the importance of smartly dressed Congolese men. Today A sapeur in Kinshasa (2014) Congolese dandies living in Paris and other European cities were only deemed sapeur once they returned to Brazzaville in the summer to showcase their style before the mid-1990s. Although war and strife had riddled the Congo over the years, there has been a revival of La Sape in Brazzaville. Whereas before in the early 1980s when campaigns were being prompted to bar La Sape from public spaces, they are now well respected and are \\"darlings of the regime.\\" They have been raised to a higher status of \\"cultural heritage\\" by Denis Sassou Nguesso by allowing them to participate in public cultural events like the African Exhibit of Fashion and Crafts (Salon africain de la mode et de l‚Äôartisanat). Gondola argues that: Cultural influences Sapeurs are shown in a film 35 Cows and a Kalashnikov (2014), directed by Oswald von Richthofen.

The phenomenon has been observed in molecular crystals, aggregates, disordered thin films, and covalently-linked dimers, where the chromophores are oriented such that the electronic coupling between singlet and the double triplet states is large. Being spin allowed, the process can occur very rapidly (on a picosecond or femtosecond timescale) and out-compete radiative decay (that generally occurs on a nanosecond timescale) thereby producing two triplets with very high efficiency. The process is distinct from intersystem crossing, in that singlet fission does not involve a spin flip, but is mediated by two triplets coupled into an overall singlet. It has been proposed that singlet fission in organic photovoltaic devices could improve the photoconversion efficiencies. History The process of singlet fission was first introduced to describe the photophysics of anthracene in 1965. Singh, S.; Jones, W. J.; Siebrand, W.; Stoicheff, B. P.; Schneider, W. G. J. Chem. Phys. 1965, 42, 330. Early studies on the effect of the magnetic field on the fluorescence of crystalline tetracene solidified understanding of singlet fission in polyacenes. thumbnail Acenes, Pentacene and Tetracene in particular, are a prominent candidates for singlet fission. The energy of the triplet states are smaller than or equal to half of the singlet (S1) state energy, thus satisfying the requirement of S1 ‚â• 2T1. Singlet fission in functionalized pentacene compounds has been observed experimentally. Intramolecular singlet fission in covalently linked pentacene and tetracene dimers has also been reported. The detailed mechanism of the process is unknown. Particularly, the role of charge transfer states in the singlet fission process is still debated. Typically, the mechanisms for singlet fission are classified into (a) Direct coupling between the molecules and (b) Step-wise one-electron processes involving the charge-transfer states. Intermolecular interactions and the relative orientation of the molecules within the aggregates are known to critically effect the singlet fission efficiencies.Polymorphism Controlled Singlet Fission in TIPS-Anthracene: Role of Stacking Orientation, Kalishankar Bhattacharyya and Ayan Datta, J.

She received her BFA degree from The Cooper Union School of Art, New York, New York, in 1997. Since her graduation she has rapidly risen to critical acclaim, and her work has been featured in major surveys of contemporary art, importantly the 2004 Whitney Biennial. Inspirations The characters in Cutler's prints and paintings will often be wearing elaborately patterned clothing. Cutler utilizes culturally-inspired patterns from women's clothing from around the world. She draws inspiration from sources as varied as U.S. military survival manuals, nature books, Japanese woodblock prints, Persian miniatures, and Indonesian designs. She admits that she isn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äútrue to the source‚Äù as she picks and chooses elements from the source material, while also expanding on it. Ceremonial textiles based on Indian and Chinese designs are worn by some of the characters Cutler has created. The artist has stated that some of her work is inspired by her rejection of traditional gender roles in her 30s, when she chose to buy her own house instead of getting married and having children. Motherhood, though an inspiration for several of her works, is shown from a third-party perspective as the artist is now a mother. She has said of her art involving motherhood that ‚ÄúYou ignore the woman...the woman is the life support\\".  Themes  Cutler's drawings, paintings, and prints often focus on groups of women, dressed in Victorian style clothing, doing familiar \\"women's work\\". Using this, she creates strange narratives that play off of known fairy tales and archetypes.Vitamin D: New Perspectives in Drawing, 2005/ Her women characters are frequently paired in scenes with household items, wild animals and hybrid creatures. Despite her figures' childlike appearances they exhibit darker themes such as poverty, social injustice and violence.  Style  Cutler's style is characterized by intricate and linear figurative drawings, her figured are often depicted with elongated noses teapot heads, and broomstick arms. Cutler's painting work features negative space frequently around her characters, showing her desire to ‚Äú...get rid of the background‚Äù, which she credits for her choice to switch from painting on wood to primarily painting with gouache on paper.http://sitesantafe.org/lecture-archive/amy-cutler- artists-talk/ Exhibitions Cutler has held several solo exhibitions including museum shows at the Art, Design & Architecture Museum, California (2012), the Huntington Museum of Art, West Virginia (2012), the Weatherspoon Art Museum, North Carolina (2010), the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Maine (2008), the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid (2007), the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indiana (2006), Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (2002).

Life and work Veleko was born on 19 August 1977 in Bodibe, North West (South African province). She grew up in Cape Town and attended Luhlaza High School in Khayelitsha. In 1995 she studied graphic design at the Cape Technikon. After moving to Johannesburg, she studied photography at the Market Theatre Photo Workshop(1999‚Äì2004), an organisation co-founded by David Goldblatt which aims to provide formal training to young photographers who would otherwise not have access to such resources. In 2003, Veleko documented graffiti throughout Cape Town and Johannesburg, a series she titles The ones on top won't make it Stop! in her first solo exhibition at the Johannesburg Art Gallery. These photographs encapsulated the social and political atmosphere of post-apartheid South Africa. This same year, Veleko was nominated for the MTN New Contemporaries Arts Awards. This competition identifies four rising South African artists and selects a winner. Throughout the next couple of years, her work was showcased in various exhibitions throughout South Africa, Europe and Australia. In 2006, her photographs were part of the group exhibition Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography, at the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York. There, the bold and lively portraits depicting South Africa street style from her series Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder attracted a great deal of attention and international acclaim, shifting previous perceptions of Africa as a whole on an international scale. Veleko explains that she looks at fashion ‚Äúand how it creates identity, because fashion plays with identity‚Äù. In regards to the title of the series, she states: ‚ÄúI thought the way I see beauty and the way I perceive beauty might be different to someone else next to me...So the project is called Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder, because for me they are beautiful.‚Äù Alongside this, Veleko has also included clothing in her projects \\"to deliberately challenge assumptions of identity based on appearances and historical background\\". Such is evident in her more personal project from 2002, www.notblackenough.lolo, which depicted an exploration of mixed cultural and racial identity through different costumes of role play. In 2006, Veleko‚Äôs work was also exhibited in Personae & Scenarios-the new African photography at the Brancolini Grimaldi Arte Contemporanea in Rome, Italy. That same year, her photographs were displayed in the exhibition titled Olvida Quien Soy- Erase Me from Who I Am at the Centro Atlantico de Arte Mordeno in Las Palmas, Canary Islands. In 2007, Veleko's work and reputation reached a larger international audience with her work being exhibited throughout Southern Africa, Europe, Asia, North and South America. She has also been a part of shows such as 7th Recontres Africaines de la Photographie exhibition. During this year, she also received a two-month residency with the International Photographic Research Network (IPRN) in the UK where she explored the notions of work, identity and clothes. In 2008, Veleko was the second photographer to be awarded the Standard Bank Young Artist for Visual Art for her traveling exhibition Wonderland. This focuses on familiar aspects of her previous work such as fashionable street-goers, primarily younger adults, as well as graffiti and personal spaces. Through exploration of such subjects Veleko continues to delve deeper and defy clich√©s of outdated perceptions of South Africans, and Africans in a larger context, that have been largely focused on the notions of fashion and the way of life. Wonderland not only displays the unique personalities of eclectically dressed urbanites but also captures the cosmopolitan nature of cities such as Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. Veleko's work presents a strong statement of a younger generation that is loud, self-expressive and daring; a collection of youth she strongly relates to. Such sentiments are evident in the photographs resulting from what she considers to be a \\"collaborative process\\". The portraits are taken after being granted permission from the subjects. She gives copies of the photos to their rightful owners and invites them to the exhibition openings. For the ongoing series of graffiti shots The ones on top won't make it Stop, Veleko met the graffiti artists and continued to follow the progress of those whose style she favoured. > Graffti, like photography is a form of visual communication.

She was also a project manager/co-coordinator at the Market Photo Workshop, where she was previously a student. Reception In discussion of her photography, Mark Stevens wrote in the New York Magazine Art Review, \\"It was a shock- an awakening shock- to come upon the bursting contemporary colours worn by the fashion-struck people portrayed by Nontsikelelo \\"Lolo\\" Veleko on the streets of Johannesburg\\". Critic Leslie Camhi has related the fashion-savvy subjects of Veleko's street portraits to the widely recognisable image of \\"hipsters\\" \\"dressed in electric, Kool-Aid colours [whose] incorrigible chic and appropriations of Western icons...proclaim them heirs to Ke dandified Bamakois bourgeoisie\\". Leslie Camhi of The Village Voice (2006) further noted: :If independence has a style, this is it- vivid, highly individualised, and a touch defiant. These images are antidotes to the prevailing view of the \\"dark continent\\" as a place of entropy and despair; these are people in charge of at least their own sartorial destiny.

Hand of Mercy released three full-length albums, and two EPs, and toured extensively throughout Australia and internationally.  History  Hand of Mercy formed when guitarist Adam Mclean and friend drummer Josh Zimmer started playing together. The pair advertised for musicians with similar influences and found guitarist Joshua Campiao. At a Parkway Drive show Josh Zimmer met Scott Bird and invited him to audition as a vocalist. Bird then introduced his friend Adam van den Crust, a bassist. For several years Hand of Mercy played at hardcore venues around Sydney, and appeared at youth centres throughout the state. They began appearing as opening acts for established groups. They released two EP's Trash the Party and Scum of the Earth in 2007 and 2008 respectively. In 2010 Hand of Mercy were hired to play the annual Resist Records Sydney Hardcore Festival. Hand of Mercy's first album, The Fallout was released through Dogfight Records and the band toured in March 2011 to promote the record. Zimmer announced his departure from the band and his drumming duties were passed on to Cullum Jensen CJ Mackinnon. The band went on to play with the group A Day to Remember at the Big Top in Luna Park. In August 2011 Hand of Mercy supported For the Fallen Dreams and were then joined well-known band Parkway Drive on the 'Sick Summer' tour in December. In 2012 Hand of Mercy traveled to the USA and recorded in Cape Cod, Massachusetts with producer Shane Frisby. In June 2012 van den Crust left the band and was replaced by his friend Michael Dawson. Shortly after, the band signed with UNFD, which released the second studio album 'Last Lights' on 17 August.\\"Feature: Hand of Mercy\\" .

It was founded by Mary Harris Thompson, who received her degree in Boston in 1863 from the New England Female Medical College, the first medical school for women. Thompson's established the hospital because of her inability to gain a position at Chicago's two hospitals (one of which refused admittance to women patients). The hospital treated the wives, widows, and children of Union soldiers and it was funded by donations. The hospitals objectives were: *To afford a home for women and children among the respectable poor in need of medical and surgical aid *To treat the same classes at home by an assistant physician *To afford a free dispensary for the same *To train competent nurses An affiliated nursing school was established in 1871. The hospital building was totally destroyed in the Chicago fire of 1871 and temporary accommodations were set up quickly to deal with the aftermath. In 1872 with a $25,000 commitment from the Chicago Relief and Aid Society a permanent building was purchased. In 1885 a new building was erected on the site. The hospital provided opportunities for women exclusively until 1972 when men joined the staff. Due to financial issues it closed in 1988. History On May 8, 1865, Mary Harris Thompson founded the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children because women were not yet permitted to be on any of Chicago's hospital staffs. Thompson's objective was to serve widows and orphans of Civil War soldiers who had died in battle. The hospital depended upon the aid of wealthy Chicago women and the support of several medical men. The laywomen raised funds and managed all administrative work. The medical men became consulting physicians who aided Thompson in her medical and surgical practice. These doctors provided Thompson and her institution with the stamp of medical approval required because of a widespread prejudice against women physicians. With the rapid inflow of patients and Thompson's desire to expand women's roles in the medical field, the hospital underwent some changes. The first facility was small, with fourteen beds, a dispensary, and a pharmacy. During the first five years the hospital treated about two hundred patients and more than five hundred patients visited the dispensary. By July 1869 the facility was not large enough for the amount of incoming patients, so the hospital moved to new quarters with sixteen beds and a larger dispensary. Thompson and a fellow doctor, William H. Byford, founded Woman's Hospital Medical College and classes began in 1870. The faculty consisted of nine physicians. After the school moved its quarters closer to the hospital in October, of 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the buildings of the college, the hospital, and the homes of most of the faculty. The hospital reopened immediately for burned and sick patients in a private home on Adams Street in Chicago. The college continued classes in an Adams Street residence a few blocks from the hospital. In 1873, the Relief Aid Society of Chicago donated $25,000 for a new building and the hospital reopened that same year along with the dispensary. A house was purchased, renovated, and enlarged for the hospital's construction. A building on the grounds became the medical college and offered Thompson the opportunity to provide training for female nurses. The nursing program was not initiated until 1874 because of limited space. In 1871, the newly established Woman's Hospital Medical College (later renamed the Chicago Woman's Medical College and then the Northwestern University Woman's Medical School) provided Chicago women with access to formal medical education. Women medical students relied on the hospital for clinical observations and demonstrations. Graduates of the school, who seldom gained appointments in male hospitals, became interns, residents, and attending physicians in the hospital. After Thompson's death in 1895, the hospital was renamed the Mary Thompson Hospital for Women and Children. It continued to provide otherwise unavailable clinical opportunities for medical women until 1972, when men were integrated into the staff. In 1892, the faculty sought and secured an alliance with Northwestern University, believing that the relationship would enhance their school's respectability, ensure its longevity, and secure funding to improve teaching and laboratory facilities. Northwestern University refused to invest money in the women's medical school. As resources diminished and other medical schools in Chicago and in the nation began accepting women, the school's ability to meet students' educational needs was threatened and enrollment declined. In 1902, the Northwestern University Woman's Medical School was closed. The demise of the Woman's Hospital Medical College resulted from its success in educating women as physicians and proving that women could become physicians. The Woman's Hospital Medical College convinced other medical schools to remove obstacles to the medical education of women. The hospital soon was under financial constraints, due to the inability of patients to pay their bills. 80 percent of the patients were on some form of Medicare or Medicaid. Mary Thompson's administrators did not foresee these financial problems in 1972 when they spent $3.7 million on additions to the building, that brought the hospital up to its current capacity. In 1977 the hospital underwent extensive renovations, financed by a $3.3 million federal grant and a $3 million bank loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. In April 1988, officials stated the hospital was closed. The reasons were never completely clear, but the most likely reason was because of the financial problems caused by a lack of patients and inadequate government aid. Nursing After receiving $25,000 for the rebuilding of the hospital by The Relief Aid Society of Chicago, in 1873, a house was purchased, renovated, and enlarged for the hospital, and a building on the property became the new medical college. The new building also gave Doctor Thompson the chance to provide training for women to become nurses. In the hospital's early years the nursing program was not a possibility because of the facility's limited space. In 1874, Thompson began directing a nursing school within the hospital. All women from the Chicago area, and elsewhere, were allowed to attend lectures and, for practical instruction, to spend a certain number of morning hours in the wards daily. This continued until the new building gave better facilities, and since then nurses, whose only occupation was nursing and who could remain in the hospital, were beginning to be taught more in-depth medical procedures and required more training to be part of the nursing occupation. Each undergraduate nurse was required to serve in the several departments for two years, in this way, getting the practical instructions, which she needed to perfect herself as a nurse. The nurses received training in various medical skills, such as securing and cleaning wounds, administering proper type and dosage of a given medication for patients, and numerous other skills.(1896) In memoriam: Mary Harris Thompson, founder, head physician and surgeon of the Mary Thompson Hospital of Chicago for Women and Children ... May 1865 ‚Äì May 1895Chicago The school grew with the hospital and Thompson taught mass quantities of women who graduated as nurses. The nursing school allowed Mary Thompson to set standards, and supervise the educational process, but it also gave training to women in another professional area of medicine. A big force that helped push for nurses to be trained in anesthesiology, can be attributed to the highly skilled nurses that were trained through Mary Thompson's nursing program. These nurses were sought after by hospitals all over the country. On May 8, 1907 a new building for the nursing school was established. Dr. Lucy Waite and her assistants supervised the nurses‚Äô training. With the new building came more accommodations and a more organized location for the nurses to continue their medical training and education. Like the medical college, the nursing program also shut down. The program was discontinued due to the over supply of nurses in the field in the year 1931 then reopened on July first, 1936.Women and children's hospital to reopen school of nursing. (1936, Jun 20). Chicago Daily Tribune (1923‚Äì1963). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/181850750 The program ultimately ended in 1988, along with the hospital, due to overwhelming financial issues. Medical program After graduating and receiving her medical degree from the New England Female Medical College, Mary Harris Thompson decided to try to establish her practice in Chicago. She found employment working with women and children who lost their husbands and fathers in the Civil War. It wasn't long before she decided to raise money for a hospital to tend to the overwhelming numbers of women and children seeking medical help. The Chicago Hospital for Women and Children opened in 1865. She became the surgeon and top physician. Even though she had a medical degree, she applied to Rush Medical College for more training. The college denied her application until she enlisted the help of William Byford of Chicago Medical College. She graduated in 1870. More women were not able to follow due to numerous objections by male students and faculty. After graduation, she and Byford founded the Woman's Hospital Medical College in connection with her hospital. Thompson was a professor at the college and also maintained her position at the hospital, becoming one of the best-known women surgeons in the nation. She specialized in pelvic and abdominal surgery and also sought to improve current surgical instruments by inventing her own. Because of her competence, some males in the field who had doubts about women's capacity to practice medicine changed their views. She used her influence to aid women in pursuing careers as physicians. Organization Hospital Staff (As of 1877) From the beginning, the Mary Thompson Hospital was under the direction of a special Board of Trustees. The members of this board were major investors to the hospital. They elect the members of the Board of Councilors, who manage the hospital and its expenses. They also directed the admission of patients, alongside the attending physician, Mary Thompson. The Board of Councilors was made up entirely of females, in addition to all of the medical staff.

The group was established in 1982 and dissolved itself in 1991.  About Afrapix  Afrapix was independently funded by its members, who were both black and white. The group received both national and international feedback, as their photographs were used across the world. Oxfam used photographs by a number of Afrapix members to illustrate their 1990 publication 'We Cry for our Land: Farmworkers in South Africa', and some Afrapix pictures were also used in Oxfam's 'Front Line Africa: The Right to a Future' (1990). Afrapix members photographed their own projects and also conducted workshops in black communities that focused on photography and literacy through artwork. Afrapix members shared their technical knowledge while mentoring individuals in these areas. As the period was known as the \\"struggle years,\\" the photographs and projects produced through Afrapix were labelled as \\"struggle photography.\\" Many of the photographers considered themselves political activists or had a political agenda, and worked to raise awareness about the evils of apartheid. The various artists of Afrapix agreed that they were a team working against apartheid, but that their inspirations came from different places. Many of the images were of rallies or protests, instances of authority brutality, and impoverished areas. Kylie Thomas suggests that the history of social documentary photography in the Afrapix period is probably more complex and heterogenous than often suggested, especially when analysing the work of women photographers such as Gille De VliegKylie Thomas, \\"Wounding apertures: Violence, affect and photography during and after apartheid\\", Kronos 38 (2012). and Gis√®le Wulfsohn.Annabelle Wienand, \\"Portraits, publics and politics: Gisele Wulfsohn's photographs of HIV/AIDS, 1987‚Äì2007\\", Kronos 38 (2012).\\"Afrapix timeline 1978‚Äì1991\\", South Africa History Online. A detailed timeline of Afrapix is accessible at the SA History Online website.http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/afrapix-timeline-1978-1991  Principles and Objectives  Paul Weinberg, one of the co-founders of Afrapix, said that Afrapix aimed to be \\"an agency and a picture library and to stimulate documentary photography\\" (see 'Art and the End of Apartheid', Peffer, 2009, p.254) and also set this in the context of the day: > photography can't be divorced from the political, social issues that > surround us daily.

While working in townships, their works were confiscated at times. The facilities of some Afrapix members were pillaged. Surveillance by Security Police made situations difficult. Photographers could also be detained extralegally. Since there was no single person or persons in charge of Afrapix, there were contrasts of perspectives and ideas amongst the members. Due to this, disagreements occurred and the eventual split between the more political side and the individual documentary side, which would later be called Southlight. There were also many criticisms of the Afrapix movement. It was viewed negatively by some who thought the group only showed black Africans as powerless. Various Afrapix photographers themselves said they felt pressured to fulfill stereotypes through their images.  Projects  * Omar Badsha, ed. South Africa: The cordoned heart: Essays.

Cambridge University Press. . describe luminescence of semiconductors resulting from spontaneous recombination of electronic excitations, producing a flux of spontaneously emitted light. This description established the first step toward semiconductor quantum optics because the SLEs simultaneously includes the quantized light‚Äìmatter interaction and the Coulomb-interaction coupling among electronic excitations within a semiconductor. The SLEs are one of the most accurate methods to describe light emission in semiconductors and they are suited for a systematic modeling of semiconductor emission ranging from excitonic luminescence to lasers. Due to randomness of the vacuum-field fluctuations, semiconductor luminescence is incoherent whereas the extensions of the SLEs include the possibility to study resonance fluorescence resulting from optical pumping with coherent laser light. At this level, one is often interested to control and access higher- order photon-correlation effects, distinct many-body states, as well as light‚Äìsemiconductor entanglement. Such investigations are the basis of realizing and developing the field of quantum-optical spectroscopy which is a branch of quantum optics. Starting point The derivation of the SLEs starts from a system Hamiltonian that fully includes many-body interactions, quantized light field, and quantized light‚Äìmatter interaction. Like almost always in many-body physics, it is most convenient to apply the second- quantization formalism. For example, a light field corresponding to frequency \\\\omega is then described through Boson creation and annihilation operators \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_\\\\omega and \\\\hat{B}_\\\\omega, respectively, where the \\"hat\\" over B signifies the operator nature of the quantity. The operator-combination \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_\\\\omega\\\\,\\\\hat{B}_\\\\omega determines the photon-number operator. When the photon coherences, here the expectation value \\\\langle \\\\hat{B}_\\\\omega \\\\rangle, vanish and the system becomes quasistationary, semiconductors emit incoherent light spontaneously, commonly referred to as luminescence (L). (This is the underlying principle behind light-emitting diodes.) The corresponding luminescence flux is proportional to the temporal change in photon number, \\\\mathrm{L}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\langle \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_{\\\\omega} \\\\hat{B}_{\\\\omega} \\\\rangle = 2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Re}\\\\left[\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\omega}^\\\\star\\\\, \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} \\\\right]\\\\,. As a result, the luminescence becomes directly generated by a photon-assisted electron‚Äìhole recombination, \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} \\\\equiv \\\\Delta \\\\langle \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_\\\\omega \\\\hat{P}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\rangle that describes a correlated emission of a photon (\\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_\\\\omega) when an electron with wave vector \\\\mathbf{k} recombines with a hole, i.e., an electronic vacancy. Here, \\\\hat{P}_\\\\mathbf{k} determines the corresponding electron‚Äìhole recombination operator defining also the microscopic polarization within semiconductor. Therefore, \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} can also be viewed as photon-assisted polarization. Many electron‚Äìhole pairs contribute to the photon emission at frequency \\\\omega; the explicit \\\\Delta notation within \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} denotes that the correlated part of the expectation value \\\\langle \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_\\\\omega P_\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\rangle is constructed using the cluster- expansion approach. The quantity \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\omega} contains the dipole- matrix element for interband transition, light-mode's mode function, and vacuum-field amplitude. Principal structure of SLEs In general, the SLEs includes all single- and two-particle correlations needed to compute the luminescence spectrum self-consistently. More specifically, a systematic derivation produces a set of equations involving photon-number-like correlations \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\omega'}^\\\\star \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} + \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\omega} \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega'}^\\\\star \\\\right] cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} whose diagonal form reduces to the luminescence formula above.

The Coulomb renormalization are identical to those that appear in the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs), showing that all photon-assisted polarizations are coupled with each other via the unscreened Coulomb-interaction V_\\\\mathbf{k}. The three-particle correlations that appear are indicated symbolically via the T[\\\\Pi] contributions ‚Äì they introduce excitation-induced dephasing, screening of Coulomb interaction, and additional highly correlated contributions such as phonon-sideband emission. The explicit form of a spontaneous-emission source \\\\Omega^\\\\mathrm{spont}_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} and a stimulated contribution \\\\Omega_{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{stim} are discussed below. The excitation level of a semiconductor is characterized by electron and hole occupations, f^e_\\\\mathbf{k} and f^h_\\\\mathbf{k}, respectively. They modify the \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} via the Coulomb renormalizations and the Pauli- blocking factor, \\\\left( 1-f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k}}-f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k}}\\\\right). These occupations are changed by spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes, yielding \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} f^e_\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\right_\\\\mathrm{L} = \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} f^h_\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\right_\\\\mathrm{L} = -2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Re} \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{\\\\omega} \\\\mathcal{F}^{\\\\star}_\\\\omega \\\\, \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} \\\\right]\\\\,.

Intuitively, f^e_\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\, f^h_\\\\mathbf{k} describes the probability to find electron and hole with same \\\\mathbf{k} when electrons and holes are uncorrelated, i.e., plasma. Such form is to be expected for a probability of two uncorrelated events to occur simultaneously at a desired \\\\mathbf{k} value. The possibility to have truly correlated electron‚Äìhole pairs is defined by a two-particle correlation c_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}}; the corresponding probability is directly proportional to the correlation. In practice, c_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}} becomes large when electron‚Äìhole pairs are bound as excitons via their mutual Coulomb attraction. Nevertheless, both the presence of electron‚Äìhole plasma and excitons can equivalently induce the spontaneous-emission source. As the semiconductor emits light spontaneously, the luminescence is further altered by a stimulated contribution \\\\Delta\\\\Omega_{\\\\omega}^\\\\mathrm{stim} = \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\sum_{\\\\omega} \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\omega'} \\\\,\\\\Delta \\\\langle \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_{\\\\omega} \\\\hat{B}_{\\\\omega'} \\\\rangle that is particularly important when describing spontaneous emission in semiconductor microcavities and lasers because then spontaneously emitted light can return to the emitter (i.e., the semiconductor), either stimulating or inhibiting further spontaneous-emission processes. This term is also responsible for the Purcell effect. To complete the SLEs, one must additionally solve the quantum dynamics of exciton correlations \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} c_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}} = & \\\\left( \\\\tilde{\\\\epsilon}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} - \\\\tilde{\\\\epsilon}_{\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\right)\\\\, c_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\+ S_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\+ \\\\Bigl( 1-f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k'}}-f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\Bigr) \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{l}} V_{\\\\mathbf{l}-\\\\mathbf{k}'} \\\\,c_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{l}} \\\\- \\\\Bigl( 1-f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k}}-f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\Bigr) \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{l}} V_{\\\\mathbf{l}-\\\\mathbf{k}'} \\\\,c_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{l},\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\+ D_\\\\mathrm{X,\\\\,rest}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}}+ T_\\\\mathrm{X}^{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\mathbf{k'}}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} The first line contains the Coulomb-renormalized kinetic energy of electron‚Äìhole pairs and the second line defines a source that results from a Boltzmann-type in- and out- scattering of two electrons and two holes due to the Coulomb interaction.

Progress in Quantum Electronics 30 (5): 155‚Äì296. doi:10.1016/j.pquantelec.2006.12.002 Interpretation and consequences Microscopically, the luminescence processes are initiated whenever the semiconductor is excited because at least the electron and hole distributions, that enter the spontaneous-emission source, are nonvanishing. As a result, \\\\Omega^\\\\mathrm{spont}_{\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega} is finite and it drives the photon- assisted processes for all those \\\\mathbf{k} values that correspond to the excited states. This means that \\\\Pi_{\\\\omega,\\\\mathbf{k}} is simultaneously generated for many \\\\mathbf{k} values. Since the Coulomb interaction couples \\\\Pi_{\\\\omega,\\\\mathbf{k}} with all \\\\mathbf{k} values, the characteristic transition energy follows from the exciton energy, not the bare kinetic energy of an electron‚Äìhole pair. More mathematically, the homogeneous part of the \\\\Pi_{\\\\omega,\\\\mathbf{k}} dynamics has eigenenergies that are defined by the generalized Wannier equation not the free-carrier energies. For low electron‚Äìhole densities, the Wannier equation produces a set of bound eigenstates which define the exciton resonances. Buildup of photon-assisted polarization (Œ† correlation) that is initiated by the spontaneous-emission source. The buildup occurs equally for all momentum states. In a many-body system, a photon (wave arrow) is generated collectively through multiple coupled Œ†-transition correlations. Therefore, \\\\Pi_{\\\\omega,\\\\mathbf{k}} shows a discrete set of exciton resonances regardless which many-body state initiated the emission through the spontaneous-emission source. These resonances are directly transferred to excitonic peaks in the luminescence itself. This yields an unexpected consequence; the excitonic resonance can equally well originate from an electron‚Äìhole plasma or the presence of excitons.Kira, M.; Jahnke, F.; Koch, S. (1998). \\"Microscopic Theory of Excitonic Signatures in Semiconductor Photoluminescence\\". Physical Review Letters 81 (15): 3263‚Äì3266. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3263 At first, this consequence of SLEs seems counterintuitive because in few-particle picture an unbound electron‚Äìhole pair cannot recombine and release energy corresponding to the exciton resonance because that energy is well below the energy an unbound electron‚Äìhole pair possesses. However, the excitonic plasma luminescence is a genuine many-body effect where plasma emits collectively to the exciton resonance. Namely, when a high number of electronic states participate in the emission of a single photon, one can always distribute the energy of initial many-body state between the one photon at exciton energy and remaining many-body state (with one electron‚Äìhole pair removed) without violating the energy conservation. The Coulomb interaction mediates such energy rearrangements very efficiently. A thorough analysis of energy and many-body state rearrangement is given in Ref. In general, excitonic plasma luminescence explains many nonequilibrium emission properties observed in present-day semiconductor luminescence experiments. In fact, the dominance of excitonic plasma luminescence has been measured in both quantum-wellChatterjee, S.; Ell, C.; Mosor, S.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H.; Hoyer, W.; Kira, M.; Koch, S.; Prineas, J.; Stolz, H.

As the main difference, \\\\Pi_{\\\\omega,\\\\mathbf{k}} also has a photon index \\\\omega, its dynamics is driven spontaneously, and it is directly coupled to three-particle correlations. Technically, the SLEs are more difficult to solve numerically than the SBEs due to the additional \\\\omega degree of freedom. However, the SLEs often are the only (at low carrier densities) or more convenient (lasing regime) to compute luminescence accurately. Furthermore, the SLEs not only yield a full predictability without the need for phenomenological approximations but they also can be used as a systematic starting point for more general investigations such as laser designHader, J.; Moloney, J.

The presented SLEs discussion does not specify the dimensionality or the band structure of the system studied. As one analyses a specified system, one often has to explicitly include the electronic bands involved, the dimensionality of wave vectors, photon, and exciton center-of-mass momentum. Many explicit examples are given in Refs.Imhof, S.; B√ºckers, C.; Thr√§nhardt, A.; Hader, J.; Moloney, J. V.; Koch, S. W.

Semiconductors also can show several resonances well below the fundamental exciton resonance when phonon-assisted electron‚Äìhole recombination takes place. These processes are describable by three-particle correlations (or higher) where photon, electron‚Äìhole pair, and a lattice vibration, i.e., a phonon, become correlated. The dynamics of phonon-assisted correlations are similar to the phonon-free SLEs. Like for the excitonic luminescence, also excitonic phonon sidebands can equally well be initiated by either electron‚Äìhole plasma or excitons.B√∂ttge, C. N.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.

It was located at Wilhelmina Park, which demolished around 1961 and replaced by the Istiqlal Mosque. The local people often referred to the fort as Gedung Tanah (The Ground Building). History Origins The site was once the location of a tavern, built before 1669. In 1723 sergeant-major Herman van Baijen rebuilt the tavern as a large country house. Later, from 1743 to 1820, the building was used as a hospital, called the Outer Hospital because it was outside the city walls. The location was considered healthy since it was in the low hills inland from Batavia, so the risk of malaria was lower. The site was in what would become Wilhelmina Park in the Weltevreden area, today's Sawah Besar, between the two branches of the Ciliwung River. The surrounding countryside was extremely fertile, with deep, rich topsoil. Construction The fort before 1918 The fort was built in 1837 to the order of Governor-General Johannes van den Bosch as part of a planned line of defence in today's Kebon Sirih, Menteng. The engineer Colonel Carel van der Wyck designed the building, and Captain Lucius Gerhard Johan George Schonermarck was responsible for construction. Prince Willem Frederik Hendrik (1820‚Äì1879) laid the first stone, and later opened the fort. The citadel was named after the prince, one of the sons of King William II of the Netherlands and one of the few members of the royal family to visit the East Indies. Wilhelmina Park Surrounding Citadel Prins Frederik was Wilhelmina Park, built to honour Queen Wilhelmina who was born 31 August 1898. The park was built on the initiative of van den Bosch in 1834. The park had an area of 9.32 hectors, was known as the largest park ever in Batavia, even the largest modern park in Asia at the time. Aside from functioning as a vegetable garden for Dutch officers in the region, the Wilhelmina park was also one of the favorite sightseeing spots for Company officials, as well as landlords who settled around Weltevreden. The location of this park was in front of the Jakarta Cathedral Church. There was also Waterloo Monument (or Atjeh-Monument), the monument built to commemorate the death of Dutch soldiers in the Aceh War. Structure The fort was built from brick, and was protected by an earth rampart. It was rectangular, with a bastion at each corner. The windows could be used as portholes for cannon. A rectangular tower in the center had clocks, windows and doors on each side, and was used as a look-out. The defences were never put to the test, since no enemies attacked Batavia until 1942, by which time it was obsolete.

Britton was an original member of the Kentucky Negro Education Association, which formed in 1877. She was president of the Lexington Woman's Improvement Club and later served as a charter member of the Ladies Orphan Society which founded the Colored Orphan Industrial Home in Lexington, in 1892. During her lifetime she accomplished many things through the obstacles she faced. After teaching black children in Lexington public schools, she worked as a doctor from her home in Lexington. She specialized in hydrotherapy, electrotherapy and massage; and, she was officially granted her license to practice medicine in Lexington, Kentucky in 1902, making her the first woman doctor to be licensed in Lexington. Background and early life Mary Ellen Britton was born as a free person of color on April 5, 1855, the only one of her siblings for whom a record of birth can be located. She was one of seven children of Laura and Henry Britton who lived on Mill Street, somewhere between Second and Third Streets which is now in the Gratz Park Historical District of Lexington, Kentucky. Contrary to the limited opportunities many other African-Americans of the time were allowed, she and her siblings‚ÄîSusan J. (born 1850), Julia (born 1852), Joseph (also known as Josiah, born 1856), Robert H. (born 1857), Martha (born 1860), William (born 1867) and Hattie (born 1868), Lucy (born ca. 1872), and Thomas Marshall (born 1873) ‚Äî all acquired a classical education. Her father Henry was a freeborn carpenter (born around 1824) of Spanish/Indian heritage who later became a barber in Lexington and Berea. Her mother, Laura Trigg, was a gifted singer and musician who had been well-educated under the protection of her mother who was an enslaved mistress to Kentucky statesman Thomas F. Marshall. Laura had been emancipated at the age of sixteen. At a young age Britton was offered the best education possible for African American children in that time - attending private schools created out of subscriptions from Lexington's African-American professional class. In 1859, along with older sister Julia Britton Hooks (later known as a gifted musician and educator, as well as Berea's first African American teacher), Britton attended a branch school in Lexington started by Mr. William H. Gibson of Louisville, Kentucky.See more about Gibson's public career in Louisville and the branch schools he opened in 1859 in Lexington and Frankfort, p. 69: The family later moved to Berea, Kentucky where Laura Britton was hired as a matron at Berea College. From 1871 to 1874, Mary E. Britton attended Berea College, the first institution of higher learning to admit blacks in the state of Kentucky. At the time the only profession offered to an educated woman of any race was teaching. While she was there as a student, she was also a part of the faculty teaching instrumental music - making her the first African-American to teach white students at Berea. After the death of both her parents (within four months of each other in 1874), Britton left Berea in order to seek employment. She taught in the Lexington School System beginning around 1876 and ending in August 1897. Professional career After leaving Berea, Britton taught in several schools in central Kentucky and advocated for the improvement of pedagogy in African-American schools. Her paper entitled \\"Literary Culture of the Teacher\\" was presented at the second meeting of the Kentucky Negro Education Association (KNEA) in Louisville in 1879. At the Ninth Annual Convention of the KNEA in Danville, she gave two speeches, the second of which (on July 6, 1887), she spoke out on behalf of woman suffrage. In her speech, which later was published as \\"Woman's Suffrage: A Potent Agency in Public Reform,\\" she argued that women, like men, had a right to define their own fate within the laws of the land, and that laws should be equally applied to both women and men. She wrote: \\"If woman is the same as man then she has the same rights, if she is distinct from man then she has a right to the ballot to help make laws for her government.\\" In 1894 she presented \\"History and Science of Teaching\\" before the American Association of Educators of Colored Youth in Baltimore, Maryland. On April 15, 1892, Britton presented a speech to the joint Railroad Committee of the Kentucky General Assembly on behalf of a delegation of women protesting the Separate Coach bill. In her speech, she questioned the white supremacists' assumptions about their monopoly on virtue, intelligence, and aestheticism - reminding the legislators of the horrors of slavery and atrocities by whites that were allowed. She also decried the segregationist approach of punishing a whole group of people simply because of their shared color of skin when only one African-American was convicted and punished for a crime committed. Britton argued on behalf of all Americans and their right to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" concluding that a law based solely on race was unjust and un-American. That same year, Britton and 19 other women met at St. Paul A.M.E. Church to establish the Ladies Orphans' Home Society. This group raised the money and created the Colored Orphan Industrial Home in Lexington, Kentucky. This organization provided food, shelter, education and training to destitute orphans and elderly, homeless women until it closed in 1988. In 1893 Britton tested whether the grand \\"White City\\" in Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 was open to blacks. African-American participation in the exhibits had been very limited, leading to calls for protests. According to Karen Cotton McDaniel, Britton was curious if the Kentucky building in the Exposition would allow her entrance. Her open defiance of white supremacy at the door of the Kentucky exhibit‚Äîand subsequent \\"humiliation, indignation and other strains she experienced\\" was highly publicized. She resigned from teaching in 1897 to work at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan where she learned about hydrotherapy, phototherapy, thermotherapy, electrotherapy and mechanotherapy‚Äîthe strategies and health principles advocated by the Seventh- day Adventist Church to which she belonged. She attended classes there with the American Medical Missionary College and took classes in Chicago, graduating in 1902. She returned home and became the first African-American woman licensed to practice medicine in Lexington, Kentucky. After about a year, she built home and office at 545 North Limestone Street (fronting Rand Avenue) where she practiced for over twenty years. Other accomplishments and attributions Britton was an original member of the Kentucky Negro Education Association which was formed in 1877 to improve schools for African-American children and to make statewide changes through legislative action. She was also President of the Lexington Woman's Improvement Club. The initial goal for this club was the \\"elevation of women, the enriching and betterment of home, and the encitement of proper pride and interest in race.\\" For many years, the Club managed a Day Nursery for the children of working mothers. Her writings on moral and social reform can be found in local newspapers such as the Lexington American Citizen and the Lexington Daily Transcript‚Äîshe wrote a regular women's column in the Lexington Herald (signed \\"Meb\\"). She also wrote for the Cleveland Gazette, the Indianapolis World, the Baltimore Ivy and the American Catholic Tribune in Cincinnati. Death Dr. Britton never married or had children. Most of her siblings died before her, most at an early age. Martha and Joseph died in childhood sometime after 1860; Hattie shot herself in the head at the age of 23 while living with sister Julia in Memphis. Thomas, her youngest brother, went on to become a successful jockey, but in 1901 at the age of 28 and banned from many racetracks he committed suicide by drinking carbolic acid.Britton, Thomas M., Sr. \\"Tom\\" Notable Kentucky African Americans Database Lucy had married Will F. \\"Monk\\" Overton (a jockey whose career was also overturned by Jim Crow), but died in her early thirties from acute nephritis.Interstitial nephritis Medline Plus In 1914 the eldest sister, Susan who was the wife of a prominent African-American barber in Lexington named Benjamin Franklin, died. Dr. Britton retired from her medical practice at the age of 68 in 1923. Mary E. Britton died in Lexington's St. Joseph Hospital on August 27, 1925, only a few hours after she had been admitted. The Blue Grass Medical Society published a proclamation in the Lexington Leader (August 30, 1925) describing their esteem for her work and character. The funeral was held at her home/office on North Limestone and she was buried in Lexington's segregated Greenwood Cemetery (now known as Cove Haven).http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid;=1802031 She willed most of her estate to her sister Julia Britton Hooks and Julia's sons, and she gave her library to the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Education In 1952, Rasul earned a BA in Political Science cum laude from the University of the Philippines, Diliman, in Quezon City. She also obtained a master's degree in National Security Administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines. In 1978, Rasul earned doctoral credits in public administration from the University of the Philippines' College of Public Administration. Political career Rasul, together with Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani, was one of the first women senators in Congress reestablished during the Fifth Republic. Her first experience in government and public service, however, was as a public school teacher in Siasi and Jolo from 1952 to 1957. From 1963 to 1964, she became technical assistant to the Office of the President of the Philippines. She has been an advocate of adult literacy and peace-building for years through her affiliations to various non- government organizations. The political career of Rasul started when she became a barrio councilor of Moore Avenue, Jolo, for two consecutive terms; from 1960 to 1961 and from 1962 to 1963. From 1971 to 1976, she was a provincial board member of the Provincial Board of Sulu. She also served as a Commissioner for Muslim and other ethnic minorities from 1978 to 1987 while being affiliated with the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports (renamed the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports during the administration of President Corazon Aquino) as a member of its board. Senate tenure Rasul was elected senator and served for two consecutive terms; from 1987 to 1992 and from 1992 to 1995. As a senator for eight years, Rasul authored, co- authored, and/or sponsored important legislation concerning women's rights, Muslim affairs, family, and gender equality. An important legislation that she co-authored with Senator Raul Roco was Republic Act No. 7192 or the Women in Development and Nation-Building Act of 1995. The Act outlawed discrimination against women, opened the doors of the Philippine Military Academy to women, and mandated that a substantial portion of government funds at all levels be used for programs that would benefit and develop women's capabilities. She also sponsored Republic Act No. 6949, the law declaring March 8 of every year as National Women's Day in the Philippines. Rasul was also the chairperson of such important Senate committees as Civil Service and Government Recognition, and Women and Family Relations. Rasul was recognized by the Senate and the Women and Gender Institute of Miriam College for her dedication to her legislative duties and for her tireless effort to pursue gender equality, improve Philippine society, and promote and uphold democracy. She was also designated as Honorary Ambassador of UNESCO during the International Literacy Year in 1990. Personal life She was married to former Philippine Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Abraham A. Rasul (1922 - 2002), with whom she has six children.

Notions of socialism in Great Britain have taken many different forms from the utopian philanthropism of Robert Owen through to the reformist electoral project enshrined in the birth of the Labour Party.  Origins  The Reformation occurred later in Britain than in most of mainland Europe. As in the rest of Europe, various liberal thinkers such as Thomas More became prominent, but another important current was the emergence of the radical Puritans who wanted to reform both religion and the nation. The Puritans were oppressed by both the monarchy and by the established church. Eventually these pressures exploded in the violent social revolution known as the English Civil War, which many Marxists see as the world's first successful bourgeois revolution. During the war several proto-socialist groups emerged. The most important of these groups were the Levellers, who advocated electoral reform, universal trial by jury, progressive taxation and the abolition of the monarchy and aristocracy and of censorship. This was strongly opposed by Oliver Cromwell's government, who also persecuted the moderate reformist group the Fifth Monarchy Men and the radical utopian group the Diggers.  19th century   Industrial Revolution and Robert Owen  The Industrial Revolution, the transition from a farming economy to an industrial one, began in the UK over 30 years before the rest of the world. Textile mills and coal mines sprang up across the whole country and peasants were taken from the fields to work down the mines, or into the \\"Dark, Satanic Mills\\", the chimneys of which blacked the sky over Lancashire and West Yorkshire. Appalling conditions for workers, combined with support for the French Revolution turned some intellectuals to socialism. The pioneering work of Robert Owen, a Welsh radical, at New Lanark in Scotland, is sometimes credited as being the birth of British Socialism. He stopped employing Children under the age of 10, and instead arranged for their education, and improved the working and living conditions of all his workers. He also lobbied Parliament over child labour, and helped to create the co- operative movement, before attempting to create a utopian community at New Harmony.  Trade unions  The trade union movement in Britain gradually developed from the Medieval guild system. Unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, but were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as Luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the Radical War (or Scottish Insurrection) in Scotland in 1820, when 60,000 workers went on a general strike, which was soon crushed. From 1830 on, attempts were made to set up national general unions, most notably Robert Owen's Grand National Consolidated Trades Union in 1834, which attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries. It played a part in the protests after the Tolpuddle Martyrs' case, but soon collapsed. Militants turned to Chartism, the aims of which were supported by most socialists, although none appear to have played leading roles. More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The London Trades Council was founded in 1860, and the Sheffield Outrages spurred the establishment of the Trades Union Congress in 1868. Union membership grew as unskilled and women workers were unionised, and socialists such as Tom Mann played an increasingly prominent role.  Christian socialism  The rise of Non-Conformist religions, in particular Methodism, played a large role in the development of trade unions and of British socialism. The influence of the radical chapels was strongly felt among some industrial workers, especially miners and those in the north of England and Wales. The first group calling itself Christian Socialists formed in 1848 under the leadership of Frederick Denison Maurice. Its membership mainly consisted of Chartists (see below). The group became dormant after only six years, but there was a considerable revival of Christian socialism in the 1880s, and a number of groups sprang up. Ultimately, Christian socialists dominated the leadership of the Independent Labour Party, including James Keir Hardie.  Chartist movement  The Chartist movement of the 1830s and 1840s was the first mass revolutionary movement of the British working-class. Mass meetings and demonstrations involving millions of proletariat and petty- bourgeois were held throughout the country for years. The Chartists published several petitions to the British Parliament (ranging from 1,280,000 to 3,000,000 signatures), the most famous of which was called the People's Charter (hence their name) in 1842, which demanded: # Universal suffrage for men. # The secret ballot. # Removal of property qualifications for members of parliament. # Salaries for members of parliament. # Electoral districts representing equal numbers of people. # Annually elected parliaments. The government subsequently subjected the Chartists to brutal reprisals and arrested their leaders. The remaining party then split as a result of a divide in tactics: the Moral Force Party believed in bureaucratic reformism, while the Physical Force Party believed in workers' reformism (through strikes, etc.). The Chartist movement's reformist goals, although not immediately and directly attained, were gradually achieved. In the same year as the People's Charter was created, the British Parliament instead responded by passing the 1842 Mining Act. Carefully valving the steam of the working-class movement, Parliament reduced the working day to ten hours in 1847.  Marx and early Marxism  Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels worked in England, and they influenced small √©migr√© groups including the Communist League. Engels' Condition of the Working Class in England became a popular expose of conditions for workers, but initially Marxism had little impact among Britain's working class. The first nominally Marxist organisation was the Social Democratic Federation, founded in 1882. Engels refused to support the organisation, although Marx's daughter Eleanor joined. The party soon split, with the Socialist League of William Morris becoming divided between anarchists and Marxists such as Morris and Eleanor Marx. A much later split produced the Socialist Party of Great Britain, Britain's oldest existing socialist party, and the Socialist Labour Party. Although Marxism had some impact in Britain, it was far less than in many other European countries, with philosophers such as John Ruskin and John Stuart Mill having much greater influence. Some non-Marxists theorise that this was because Britain was amongst the most democratic countries of Europe of the period, the ballot box provided an instrument for change, so a parliamentary, reformist socialism seemed a more promising route than elsewhere.  Liberal‚ÄìLabour and the Independent Labour Party  The Reform League, which was founded in 1865 to press for universal male suffrage and vote by secret ballot, qualified its demand for suffrage with the phrase \\"registered and residential\\" shortly before the passing of the 1867 Reform Act. This qualifier excluded a great number of British labourers, casual workers, and unemployed. The change in policy has been attributed to donations received by the League from Liberal Party politicians in 1866 and 1867. At the time, Marx wrote that he and Engels had been \\"betrayed [...] in the Reform League where, against our wishes, [Cremer and Oder] have made compromises with the bourgeoisie\\". However, a great deal of collaboration came to exist between the Liberal Party and the leaders of the labour movement, though Marx saw these as effective bribes by the bourgeoisie and the government. The 1867 Reform Act passed and enfranchised roughly three million people, around half of whom were working class. This was extended to five million by the Representation of the People Act 1884, which extended the householder's franchise. The Liberal Party was worried about the prospect of a socialist party taking the bulk of the working-class vote, while their great rivals the Conservatives initiated occasional intrigues to encourage socialist candidates to stand against the Liberals. In 1874, the Liberals agreed not to put candidates against Thomas Burt and Alexander Macdonald, two miners' leaders who were standing for Parliament. Both were elected and became known as Liberal-Labour or Lib-Labs for short. Other miner's leaders entered Parliament via the same route. In 1888, Robert Cunninghame-Graham the MP for Lanarkshire North-West since the 1886 general election left the Liberal Party and formed his own, independent, Scottish Labour Party, becoming the first socialist MP in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. At the 1892 general election, Keir Hardie, another Liberal politician who had joined Cunninghame-Graham in the Scottish Labour Party, was elected as an Independent Labour MP, and this gave him the spur to found a UK- wide Independent Labour Party in 1893.  20th century  Timeline of parties in the broad socialist movement The early twentieth century saw a number of socialist groups and movements in Britain. As well as the Independent Labour Party and the Social Democratic Federation, there was a mass movement around Robert Blatchford's newspaper The Clarion from the 1890s to the 1930s; the more intellectual gradualist Fabian Society; and more radical groups such as the Socialist Labour Party. However, the movement was increasingly dominated by the formation of the British Labour Party.  Birth of the Labour Party  In 1900, representatives of various trade unions and of the Independent Labour Party, Fabian Society and Social Democratic Federation agreed to form a Labour Party backed by the unions and with its own whips. The Labour Representation Committee was founded with Keir Hardie as its leader. At the 1900 general election, the LRC won only two seats, and the SDF disaffiliated, but more unions signed up. The LRC affiliated to the Socialist International and in 1906 changed its name to The Labour Party. It formed an electoral pact with the Liberals, intending to cause maximum damage to the Unionist government at the forthcoming election. This was successful, and in the process, 29 Labour MPs were elected to the House of Commons.  Women's suffrage  The campaign for women's suffrage in Britain began in the mid- nineteenth century, with many early campaigners including Eleanor Marx being socialists, but many established socialists, including Robert Blatchford and Ernest Bax opposed or ignored the movement. By the early twentieth century, the campaign had become more militant, but some of its leaders were reluctant to involve working-class women in it. Sylvia Pankhurst campaigned for enfranchisement among women in the East End of London and eventually built up the Workers Socialist Federation.  Syndicalism and World War I  Supporters of Daniel De Leon in the Social Democratic Federation chiefly in Scotland split to form the Socialist Labour Party. Their fellow impossibilists in London split from the SDF the following year to form the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB, still in existence). The remainder of the SDF attempted to form a broader Marxist party, the British Socialist Party. The SLP and BSP parties came to influence the shop steward movement, which became particularly prominent in what became known as Red Clydeside. Socialists such as John Maclean led strikes and demonstrations for better working conditions and a forty-hour working week. This activity took place against the background of the First World War. The Labour Party, like almost all the Socialist International, enthusiastically supported their country's leadership in the war, as did the leadership of the British Socialist Party. This split the BSP, and a new anti-war leadership emerging.  Bolshevism and the Communist Party of Great Britain  The shop steward movement worried many right-wingers, who believed that socialists were fomenting a Bolshevik revolution in Britain. A Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was founded, but it attracted only existing left-wing militants, with the British Socialist Party and Workers Socialist Federation joining many Socialist Labour Party activists in it. The CPGB soon became known for its loyalty to the line of the Comintern, and proposed the motion to expel Leon Trotsky from the international. Under the leadership of Harry Pollitt, it finally gained its first MP, and began to expel Trotskyists.  Labour and the general strike  The Labour Party continued to grow as more unions affiliated and more Labour MPs were elected. In 1918, a new constitution was agreed, which laid out several aims of the party. These included Clause IV, calling for \\"common ownership\\" of key industry. With their success at the 1923 general election, Labour were able to form their first minority government, led by Ramsay MacDonald. This government was undermined by the infamous Zinoviev Letter, which was used as evidence of Labour's links with the Soviet Union. It was later revealed to be a forgery. In 1926, British miners went on strike over their appalling working conditions. The situation soon escalated into the General Strike, but the Trade Union Congress, ostensibly worried about reports of starvation in the pit villages, called the strike off. The miners tried to continue alone, but without TUC support had eventually to give in. Labour formed a minority government in 1929 again under MacDonald, but following the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the Great Depression engulfed the country. The government split over its response to the crisis. MacDonald and a few supporters agreed to form a National Government with the Liberals and the Conservatives. The majority of the Labour Party regarded this as a betrayal and expelled them, whereupon they founded National Labour. The Great Depression devastated the industrial areas of Northern England, Wales and Central Scotland, and the Jarrow March of unemployed workers from the North East to London to demand jobs defined the period.  Ethical socialism  Ethical socialism is a variant of liberal socialism developed by British socialists.John Dearlove, Peter Saunders. Introduction to British politics. Wiley-Blackwell, 2000.

Oswald Mosley  Oswald Mosley had been a rising star in the Conservative Party but left over the government's policy of repression in Ireland and eventually joined Labour. Mosley rose just as quickly on the Labour benches and was a government minister charged with dealing with unemployment during the Great Depression. Mosley proposed the \\"Mosley Memorandum\\" which suggested the formation of Cabinet committees to deal with specific policy issues, rationalisation and mechanisation in industry to make it more competitive, and a programme of public works. Although the memorandum prefigured Keynesian policies that would be accepted by later governments, it was too radical a set of proposals for 1930 and both the Labour government and the party rejected it. In response, Mosley left Labour in 1931 to found the New Party, taking four other Labour MPs with him. The New Party failed to win any seats in 1932 and Mosley subsequently came to support fascism, merging his party with several far-right groups to form the British Union of Fascists.  Spanish Civil War and World War II  ARP Canteen Fund\\" The Independent Labour Party disaffiliated from the Labour Party in 1932, in protest at an erosion of their MPs' independence. For a time, they became a significant left-of-Labour force. In 1936, the Spanish Civil War was viewed by many socialists as a contest against the rise of fascism which it was vital to win. Many CPGB and Independent Labour Party members went to fight for the Republic and with the Stalinist led International Brigades and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) anti-fascist forces, including George Orwell who wrote about his experiences in Homage to Catalonia. The Labour Party leadership always supported British involvement in World War II, and they joined a national government with the Conservative Party and the Liberals, and agreed a non-contest pact in elections. The CPGB at first supported the war, but after Joseph Stalin signed a treaty with Adolf Hitler, opposed it. After the fascist invasion of the Soviet Union, they again supported the war, joined the non- contest pact, and did all in their power to prevent strikes. But strikes did occur, and they were supported by the anti-war Independent Labour Party and the newly formed Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist Party.  1945 landslide Labour victory  To widespread surprise, the Labour Party led by wartime Deputy Prime Minister Clement Attlee won a landslide victory over popular war leader Winston Churchill at the 1945 general election, and implemented their social democratic programme. They established the NHS, nationalised some industries (for example, coal mining), and created a welfare state. The CPGB also grew on the back of Stalinist successes in Eastern Europe and China, and recorded their best-ever result, with two MPs elected (one in London and another in Fife). The Trotskyite Revolutionary Communist Party collapsed. Labour lost power in 1951 and after Clement Attlee retired as party leader in 1955, he was succeeded by the figurehead of the \\"right-establishment\\" Hugh Gaitskell, against Aneurin Bevan. Although there were some disputes between the Bevanites and the Gaitskellites, these disputes were more about personality than ideology, and the rift was healed when Harold Wilson, a Bevanite, was elected as Leader of the Labour Party after Gaitskell's sudden death.  1960s and 1970s  The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament briefly gained leverage over Labour Party policy at the beginning of the decade, but soon went into a long eclipse. The Vietnam War, given lukewarm support by Harold Wilson, radicalised a new generation. Significant anti-war protests were organised. Trotskyist groups like the International Marxist Group and the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign came to prominence, particularly due to high- profile members like the IMG's Tariq Ali. After the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the CPGB became to divide between Stalinists and Eurocommunists. The party suffered a series of splits. Various Maoist inclined elements left, the most significant forming the Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist). Later in 1977, other traditionalist pro-Russian elements left to form the New Communist Party. In 1969, Wilson's Labour Government introduced In Place of Strife, a white paper designed to circumvent strikes by imposing compulsory arbitration. Opposed by many trade unionists, including Home Secretary James Callaghan; it was soon withdrawn. Later legislation passed by Edward Heath's Conservative government was successfully resisted as union militants, many close to the CPGB, led the successful 1974 UK miners' strike. More ominously for the left, the unsuccessful Grunwick dispute, and the 1978‚Äì79 Winter of Discontent were also blamed on them. The Labour leadership's failure to work with trade unions, or for their opponents an inability to keep them under control, resulted in the election in 1979 of an economically liberal Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, which finally ended the post-war political consensus.  1980s  After the 1979 Labour defeat, Jim Callaghan tried in vain to keep the left-wing of the party (in which Tony Benn was prominent) and the right-wing (in which Roy Jenkins was prominent) together. In 1980, the Labour Party conference was dominated by factional disputes and what Callaghan regarded as Bennite motions. Callaghan resigned as party leader late that year and was replaced by Michael Foot, a left-winger who by then had distanced himself from Benn but failed to transmit this to the media or the voters. The following year, Denis Healey only narrowly won the deputy leadership in a contest with Benn. In 1981, thirty MPs on the right-wing of the Labour Party defected to found the Social Democratic Party, which formed an alliance with the Liberal Party and opinion polls briefly saw the new alliance appear capable of winning a general election. At the 1983 general election, Thatcher benefited from increased popularity, an after effect of the successful Falklands War, and a Labour manifesto which Labour MP Gerald Kaufman described as \\"the longest suicide note in history\\". Labour suffered their worst election defeat since 1918 with eight and a half million votes, over three million votes down on the previous general election. Many former Labour voters had voted for the SDP-Liberal Alliance instead. The Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes, but had only a fraction of its seats due to the limitations of the first-past-the-post system. After the 1983 general election, Neil Kinnock, long associated with the left-wing of the Labour Party, became the new leader. By that point in time, the Labour Party was factionalised between the right, including Healey and deputy leader Roy Hattersley, a \\"soft left\\" associated with the Tribune group, and a \\"hard left\\" associated with Benn and the new Campaign Group. The Trotskyist Militant tendency, using entryist tactics in the Labour Party, had gradually increased their profile. By 1982, they controlled Liverpool City Council, and had a presence in many Constituency Labour Parties. The Labour NEC began to expel Militant members, beginning with their newspaper's \\"editorial board\\", in effect their Central Committee. A revival in municipal socialism seemed, for a time, a solution to Conservative hegemony for many on the left. The Greater London Council, led by Ken Livingstone, gained the most attention, seeming genuinely innovative to its support base, but the GLC was abolished by the Conservatives in 1986. The defining event of the 1980s for British socialists was the 1984‚Äì5 miners' strike. Miners in the National Union of Mineworkers, led by Arthur Scargill, struck against the closure of collieries. Despite support in the coalfields, including many miners' wives in Women Against Pit Closures, the strike was eventually lost owing to a union split, amongst other reasons. The Conservatives had already begun to privatise other state industries. Labour lost the 1987 general election by a wide margin, although it did manage to reduce the Conservative majority significantly.  Socialism and nationalism  Scottish and Welsh nationalism have been the concern of many socialists. Having been raised in the nineteenth century by Liberals also calling for Irish Home Rule, Scottish Home Rule became the official policy of the ILP, and of the Labour Party until 1958. John Maclean campaigned for a separate Communist Party in Scotland in the 1920s, and when the CPGB refused to support Scottish independence, he formed the Scottish Workers Republican Party. The poet Hugh MacDiarmid, a Communist, was also an early member of the National Party of Scotland. The CPGB eventually changed their position in the 1940s. The early nationalist parties had little connection with socialism, but by the 1980s they had become increasingly identified with the left, and in the 1990s Plaid Cymru declared itself to be a socialist party. Following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, both the Scottish National Party and Plaid have been challenged by socialists in recent years. The Scottish Socialist Party, who also support Scottish independence as an immediate goal, has had recent electoral success; it won six MSPs in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. Forward Wales, with a less militant programme, aimed to replicate their success. Irish republicanism came to be supported by socialists in Britain. Labour's election manifestos for 1983, 1987 and 1992 included a commitment to Irish unification by consent.  1990s  In 1989 in Scotland, and 1990 for the rest of the UK, the Conservatives introduced the deeply unpopular poll tax. For the first time in the decade, socialists were able to organise effective opposition, culminating in the \\"Poll tax riot\\" on 31 March 1990. Margaret Thatcher's own party compelled her to step down on 22 November that year, and she was replaced by John Major, who abolished the charge in 1991. The CPGB dissolved itself in 1991, although their former newspaper, the Morning Star, continues to be published and follows the programme of the Communist Party of Britain which was founded in 1988 after an internal crisis in the CPGB led to a split. The Eurocommunists, who had controlled the party's magazine Marxism Today, formed the Democratic Left In the run-up to the 1992 general election, polling showed that there might be a hung parliament, but possibly a small Labour majority ‚Äì the party's lead on the opinion polls had shrunk and some polls had even seen the Tories creep ahead in spite of the deepening recession. In the event, the Conservatives led by John Major; won a fourth consecutive election with a majority of 21 seats. This has been attributed to both the Labour Party's premature triumphalism (in particular at the Sheffield Rally) and the Tories' \\"Tax Bombshell\\" advertising campaign, which highlighted the increased taxes that a Labour government would impose. This general election defeat was shortly followed by Kinnock's resignation after nearly a decade as leader. And, as had happened in the aftermath of the 1959 general election defeat, there was widespread public and media doubt as to whether a Labour government could be elected again ‚Äì without an overhaul of the party's policies, it seemed too difficult to imagine the party being able to win a general election in any situation if it had been unable to do so in the event of a recession and rising unemployment. After the brief stewardship of John Smith, Tony Blair was elected leader following Smith's sudden death from a heart attack in May 1994. He immediately decided to amend Clause IV, dropping Labour's commitment to public ownership of key industries and utilities, along with other socialist policies. Many members of the party were unhappy with the proposed changes and several unions considered using their block vote to kill the motion, but in the end their leaderships backed down and settled for a new clause declaring the Labour Party a \\"democratic socialist party\\". However, Labour had been ascendant in the opinion polls since the Black Wednesday economic fiasco a few months after the 1992 general election, and the increased lead of the polls under Blair's leadership remained strong in spite of the revolt, and the fact that the economy was growing again and unemployment was falling under Major's Conservative government. Labour's popularity was also helped by the fact that the Conservative government was now divided over Europe. Several party members, such as Arthur Scargill, regarded this as a betrayal of Labour's ideology and left the Labour Party. Scargill formed the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) which initially attracted some support, much of which transferred to the Socialist Alliance on its formation, but the SA has since been wound up and the SLP has become marginalised. The Scottish Socialist Party have proven much more successful, while Ken Livingstone became the Mayor of London, standing against an official Labour Party candidate. Livingstone was re-admitted into the Labour Party in time for his re-election in 2004. Under Blair, Labour launched a PR campaign to rebrand as New Labour. The party also introduced women-only shortlists in certain seats and central vetting of Parliamentary candidates to ensure that its candidates were seen as on-message. Labour won the 1997 general election with a landslide majority of 179 seats; their best result to date. 21st century The international anti-globalisation movement, while difficult to define, has become a focus for other socialists in the twenty-first century, and many see a reflection of it in the opposition of large sections of the population to the 2003 Iraq War. Several minor socialist parties merged in 2003 to form the Alliance for Green Socialism which is a socialist party that campaigns on a wide variety of policies including; economic, environmental and social. After George Galloway's expulsion from the Labour Party in October 2003 following his controversial statements about the war in Iraq, he became involved in Respect ‚Äì The Unity Coalition (later renamed the Respect Party) in an alliance with the Socialist Workers Party and leading figures from the Muslim Association of Britain. Galloway, who stood as a candidate for Respect, was elected as the Member of Parliament for Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2005 general election, where he defeated the sitting Labour MP; Oona King. Galloway strongly opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq while King strongly supported it. The association with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) ended in 2007. Galloway did not seek re-election for Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2010 general election, but stood at the Poplar and Limehouse constituency instead. However, he finished in third place, behind Tim Archer of the Conservatives and Jim Fitzpatrick of the Labour Party. After a two-year absence from Parliament, Galloway returned to the House of Commons after winning the 2012 Bradford West by-election. Respect though has suffered from the resignation of leading members over the years,Matthew Tempest \\"Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens\\", theguardian.com, 17 February 2004Andrew Woodcock \\"Respect chief Salma Yaqoob quits over George Galloway rape row\\", The Independent, 12 September 2012 and Galloway lost his seat to Naz Shah of the Labour Party at the 2015 general election. In 2013, director Ken Loach made an appeal seeking to create a United Left Party in light of the perceived successes seen by Syriza in Greece, the perceived failures of previous Left of Labour projects such as Socialist Alliance and the perceived failings of Respect. The Left Unity political party was founded in November 2013 as a result of the appeal.  2010 general election  The Labour Party was defeated at the 2010 general election, after talks of forming a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats failed. During their thirteen years in government, Labour made few changes to the trade union reforms passed by the previous Conservative governments, and the only nationalisation which took place during that time were of several leading banks facing collapse in the recession of 2008 and 2009 under the premiership of Gordon Brown. The Conservatives returned to power with the Liberal Democrats as a coalition government following a hung parliament; the first in 36 years. Other socialists place their hopes in a trade union revival, perhaps around the \\"Awkward Squad\\" of the more left-wing trade union leaders, many of whom have joined the Labour Representation Committee. Others have turned to more community-based politics. Yet others believe they can reclaim the Labour Party. The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) was formed in January 2010 to contest the 2010 general election. Founding supporters include Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT), Brian Caton, general secretary of the POA and Chris Baugh, assistant general secretary of the PCS. RMT and Socialist Party executive members, including Bob Crow, form the core of the steering committee. The coalition includes the Socialist Workers Party, which will also stand candidates under its banner,Party Notes, 25 January 2010, RESPECT and other trade unionists and socialist groups. This followed the No2EU coalition which fought the European elections in 2009 gaining the official backing of the RMT. The RMT declined to officially back the new TUSC coalition, but granted their branches the right to stand and fund local candidates as part of the coalition.Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition gets started, http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/8710. (Portsmouth RMT stands in election with Bob Crow's support)  2014 Scottish independence referendum  The Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) has been actively campaigning for Scottish independence since the announcement of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Its co-convenor, Colin Fox, sits on the Advisory Board of the Yes Scotland campaign organisation. The party's support for Scottish independence is rooted in a belief that \\"the tearing of the blue out of the Union Jack and the dismantling of the 300-year-old British state would [be] a traumatic psychological blow for the forces of capitalism and conservatism in Britain, Europe and the USA\\", and that it would be \\"almost as potent in its symbolism as the unravelling of the Soviet Union at the start of the 1990s\\". Representatives of the party have also claimed that while the break-up of the United Kingdom would not result in \\"instant socialism\\", it would cause \\"a decisive shift in the balance of ideological and class forces\\". The campaign for independence has also enjoyed support from a minority of trade unionists. In 2013, a branch of the Communications Workers Union covering Edinburgh, Lothians, Fife, Falkirk, and Stirling voted to back a motion describing independence as \\"the only way forward for workers in Scotland\\", and agreeing to \\"do all in our power to secure [a Yes] outcome\\". Additionally, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has refused to take a stance on the referendum, instead laying out \\"challenges for both sides of the debate\\", in particular calling on Better Together to \\"outline a practical vision of how social and economic justice can be achieved within the union\\". Other left-wing sections refused to support a nationalist position, instead arguing either for working-class unity or a critical approach to both sides. Campaigns such as Socialism First and the Red Paper Collective were a challenge to the official campaigns on both sides arguing for \\"Class over Nation\\". Until 2006, the RMT was affiliated with the Scottish Socialist Party. The Labour Party campaigned in favour of a \\"No\\" vote through the referendum campaign, headed by former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, and through United with Labour, a campaign composed solely of Labour Party figures. However, some members of Scottish Labour joined Labour for Independence, a pressure group of Labour members who back Scottish independence. The appeal of independence is attributed by the group's leader to a feeling of being \\"let down and betrayed by a party who no longer represent them or the people of Scotland\\".  2015 general election  Polls had suggested a hung parliament at the 2015 general election, which was the party's first general election with Ed Miliband at the helm. When the final results were counted however, Labour suffered a second consecutive defeat and the Conservatives led by David Cameron; formed a majority government for the first time since 1992. The number of Labour MPs declined by 26 from 2010, after they lost 40 of the 41 seats they had in Scotland to the Scottish National Party and finished with 30.4% of the vote nationally and 232 seats in the House of Commons. Miliband resigned as party leader following his party's defeat and subsequently triggered a Labour Party leadership election. Harriet Harman served as acting leader while the election was contested. The Labour Party are currently the official Opposition Party. Miliband's election as Leader of the Labour Party on the back of trade union member votes had been seen by some as a return to the left following the New Labour years (1994-2010). Miliband was nicknamed \\"Red Ed\\" by some (predominantly right- wing) media. After assuming office as Leader of the Opposition, Miliband softened some of the more left-wing ideas he had adopted during the leadership election, but remained committed to causes such as a living wage and the 50% tax rate on high earners. However, the Labour Party under Miliband focused on calls for \\"responsible capitalism\\" rather than socialism. Labour's then-Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls also committed to maintaining some spending cuts scheduled for 2015 and 2016 by the Conservative-led coalition, and was accused of planning to cut the state pension. These were unpopular ideas with traditional socialists.  2017 general election  Jeremy Corbyn became Leader of the Labour Party in September 2015.

A graph showing Labour Party individual membership, excluding affiliated members and supporters, 1928-2018 In August 2015, prior to the 2015 leadership election, the Labour Party reported 292,505 full members. , the party had approximately 570,000 full members, making it the largest political party by membership in Western Europe. On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced she would seek an unexpected snap election on Thursday 8 June 2017. Corbyn said he welcomed May's proposal and said his party would support the government's move in the parliamentary vote announced for 19 April. The necessary super-majority of two-thirds was achieved when 522 of the 650 members of parliament voted in favour of an early election. Some of the opinion polls had shown a 20-point Conservative lead over Labour before the election was called, but this lead had narrowed by the day of the 2017 general election; which resulted in a hung parliament. Despite remaining in opposition for the third general election in a row, Labour won 40% of the popular vote, its greatest share of the vote since 2001. It was also the first time the Labour Party had made a net gain of seats since their 1997 landslide victory. Thirty new seats were gained to reach 262 total MPs, and, with a swing of 9.6%,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/labour-can-win-majority- if-it-pushes-for-new-general-election-within-two-years achieved the biggest percentage-point increase in its vote share at a single general election since 1945.

As with all forms of colonialism, it is based on exogenous domination, typically organized or supported by an imperial authority. Settler colonialism is enacted by a variety of means ranging from violent depopulation of the previous inhabitants to more subtle, legal means such as assimilation or recognition of indigenous identity within a colonial framework. Unlike other forms of colonialism, the imperial power does not always represent the same nationality as the settlers. However, the colonizing authority generally views the settlers as racially superior to the previous inhabitants, which may give settlers' social movements and political demands greater legitimacy than those of colonized peoples in the eyes of the home colonies, whereas natural and human resources are the main motivation behind other forms of colonialism. Despite the end of the European colonial empires, settler populations typically remain. In this way, settler colonialism lasts indefinitely, except in the rare event of complete evacuation or settler decolonization. Settler colonialism is generally discussed in terms of the one-way flow of British values, which overtake and repudiate the culture and history of the location in question. Transnational and global studies of settler colonialism often give more importance to the histories of British emigrants rather than of the displaced indigenous peoples. Legal proceedings in Australia and Canada have challenged settler rights, highlighting the lasting effects of colonial takeovers, and the continued displacement of Indigenous peoples at the start of the twenty-first century. In the United States, Western Australia and South Africa, governments used land allotment as a legal way to take possession of indigenous peoples' land. In the ancient world Settler colonialism has occurred extensively throughout human history, including in the ancient world.  Greek colonization  Greek (in red) and Phoenician (in yellow) colonies around 8th to 6th century BC Following the collapse of the Greek Bronze Age, Greek City states, or poleis, began to grow. By the 8thcentury BCE, population growth was no longer sustainable in and around the Aegean, prompting the Ancient Greeks to look to the other shores of the Mediterranean and Black Sea to direct their people to. Miletus, an Ionian Greek city-state on the Western shore of Anatolia, was a rich polis that was considered to be greatest Greek metropolis. Pliny the Elder, in his book Natural History, credits Miletus with founding over 90 colonies, including Sinope in the Black Sea. Sinope itself founded several Greek colonies in the Black Sea region and flourished in its own right, but the site of Sinope was once a Hittite port called Sinuwa before being colonized by the Greeks. The Hittite empire, at its height, spanned across Anatolia. The Hittites were a distinct people from the Greeks and contact between the two cultures extended back to the Late Bronze Age during the time of the Mycenaean Greeks. Sinope is an example of an Œ±œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± ‚Äì apoikia (pl.: Œ±œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ±Œπ, apoikiai), which is a colony that eventually develops into a self-determining city state yet keeps cultural ties with its mother city. Greek colonies were founded across the Mediterranean and facilitated the Hellenization of the basin. Cicero, the Roman orator, once made a remark about the extensive colonization movements of the Greeks and spread of their culture by saying \\"It were as though a Greek fringe has been woven about the shores of the barbarians.\\" Rome The Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire commonly established settler colonies in newly conquered regions. The colonists were often veterans of the Roman army, who received agricultural land to develop. These agricultural communities provided bastions of loyal citizens in often hostile areas of the Empire, and often accelerated the process of Romanisation among the nearby conquered peoples. Near the city of Damascus in present-day Syria, the contemporary settlements of Mezze and Deraya can trace their origins back to villages opened for settlement by the Romans during the third century CE. Philip the Arab, the Roman Emperor from 244‚Äì249, designated this area around Damascus a colonia, and encouraged settlement by veterans of the VI Ferrata legion, as commemorated by coins minted in the city around this time. Medieval Eras Germany Stages of German eastern settlement, 700-1400 Ostsiedlung was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of Germanic-speaking peoples into less-populated regions of Central Europe, parts of west Eastern Europe, and the Baltics. Japan Natives called Emishi (Tang China: ÊØõ‰∫∫) in Mutsu Province lived politically independent yet in constant battle with settlers and conquerors from further south, with Kyoto's victory over them in 802 A.D., after which there was cultural extinction and forced assimilation gradually erasing their culture and ethnicity by the time of the Northern Fujiwara. In early modern and modern times During the early modern period, some European nation-states and their agents adopted policies of colonialism, competing with each other to establish colonies outside of Europe, at first in the Americas, and later in Asia, Africa, and Oceania. In the Americas Territories in the Americas claimed by a European great power in 1750 European colonization of the Americas began as early as the 10th century, when Norse sailors explored and settled limited areas on the shores of present-day Greenland and Canada.Wolfe 2006 According to Norse folklore, violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately made the Norse abandon those settlements. Extensive European colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by Genoese Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration, colonization and industrial development soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492‚Äì93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1497, sailing from Bristol on behalf of England, John Cabot landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America. Spanish cities were founded as early as 1496 with Santo Domingo in today's Dominican Republic. Other powers such as France also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands, and small coastal parts of South America. Portugal colonized Brazil, tried early (since 1499) colonizing of the coasts of present-day Canada, and sat for extended periods on the northwest bank of the River Plate (including it in the Brazilian region). This was the beginning of a dramatic territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars, and was only slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the bubonic plague; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.\\"settlercolonialstudies.org\\" Eventually, the entire Western Hemisphere came under the ostensible control of European governments, leading to profound changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas. The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), communicable disease, and ideas between the Pan-American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas. =Settler colonialism in the United States= In the context of the United States, early colonial powers generally respected the territorial and political sovereignty of the indigenous tribes, due to the need to forge local alliances with these tribes against other European colonial powers (i.e. British attempts to check French influence, etc.). However, with the emergence of an independent United States, desire for land and the perceived threat of permanent indigenous political and spatial structures led to violent relocation of many indigenous tribes to the American West, including the notable example of the Cherokee in what is known as the Trail of Tears. While the United States government and local state governments directly aided this dispossession through the use of military forces, ultimately this came about through agitation by settler society in order to gain access to indigenous land, which in some cases (especially in the American South) used in order to build a plantation society and perpetuate the practice of slavery in the creation of said plantation. U.S. territorial acquisitionsportions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century. This forcible relocation of tribes came about in part through the mentality of Manifest Destiny, the mentality that it was the right and destiny of the United States to expand its territory and its rule across the North American continent, to the Pacific coast.The History Channel; Manifest Destiny. http://www.history.com/topics/manifest-destiny Through various armed conflicts between indigenous tribes on one side, with settler society backed by American military power on the other side, along with an increasing number of treaties centering around land cessation, Native American tribes were slowly pushed onto a system of reservations, where they traded territory for protection and support from the United States government.Columbia River Inter- Tribal Fishing Commission, Treaties: Promises between Governments. http://www.critfc.org/member_tribes_overview/treaty-q-a/Calloway, Colin G. First Peoples-A Documentary Survey of American Indian History. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2008. However, this system could be disadvantageous for tribes, as they often were forced to relocate to reservations far from their traditional homelands, or had trouble obtaining goods and annuity payments that were promised by the government, leading to further armed revolts and conflicts such as the Dakota War of 1862 in Minnesota.Anderson, Gary Clayton, and Alan R. Woodworth, eds. Through Dakota Eyes-Narrative Accounts of the Minnesota Indian War of 1862. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1988. Following the conclusion of U.S./Native American conflicts in the late 1800s, displacement of indigenous peoples and identities switched to a more legal basis. Attempts were made to assimilate them into American society while stripping away territory; legislation like the Dawes Act of 1887 led to the division of previously communally held indigenous lands into individually owned pieces of land that were to be held by tribal members.Indian Land Tenure Foundation, Land Tenure History. 'https://iltf.org/land-issues/history/ While 'allotment' was as mentioned held up as a way to help indigenous people become 'civilized' and further assimilated into settler society, other motives included the erosion of tribal culture and social unity, along with allowing for more land for European-American settlement and economic ventures to make use of indigenous lands.https://iltf.org/land-issues/history/Calloway 2008 In the educational sphere, a system of boarding schools for Native children (Col. Richard Pratt's Carlisle School being a notable example) worked to strip indigenous languages, religions and cultures away from children in order for them to better assimilate into American culture, in schools that were often geographically distant from their home reservation. Further developments such as the Federal policies of termination and relocation in the 1950s and 1960s reinforced the aims of settler society to eliminate indigenous identity and occupation of space, through the disestablishment of Federal treaty/trust obligations to tribes, the transfer of civil and criminal jurisdiction over many reservations to the individual states, and the encouragement of Native Americans to leave their reservations and relocate to cities such as New York City, Minneapolis, Denver and Portland; it was hoped that this relocation would further erode tribal identity and speed up the process of assimilation.Rosenthal, Nicolas G. \\"Repositioning Indianness: Native American Organizations in Portland, Oregon, 1959‚Äì1975.\\" Pacific Historical Review 71, no. 3 (2002): 415‚Äì38. While both policies were officially (in the case of termination) and unofficially (relocation) ended by the early 1970s, they had the effect of creating a large population of Native American urban populations, and the unintended side effect of giving rise to increased political awareness among Native Americans, leading to the creation of organizations such as the American Indian Movement. In the present day, the legacy of settler colonialism in the United States has created a complicated relationship between indigenous tribes and the United States, especially in the area of treaty rights and sovereignty.Fairbanks, Robert. \\"Native American Sovereignty and Treaty Rights: Are They Historical Illusions?\\" American Indian Law Review 20.1 (1996): 141‚Äì49Freedman, Eric. \\"When Indigenous Rights and Wilderness Collide: Prosecution of Native Americans for Using Motors in Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area.\\"American Indian Quarterly 26.3 (2002): 378‚Äì92 Much contemporary literature written by indigenous scholars and scholars within the field of American Indian Studies/Native Studies centers around recognising the disruptive effects that settler colonialism has had on Native American tribes, including land loss, destruction of tribal languages and cultures, and tribal efforts to maintain recognition of rights they have gained via treaties with the United States government.Waziyatawin. What Does Justice Look Like?-The Struggle for Liberation in Dakota Homeland. St. Paul, MN: Living Justice Press, 2008.Simpson, Audra. Mohawk Interruptus. Durham: Duke UP, 2014. Print Elizabeth Cook-Lynn defines the effects of \\"American colonialism\\" within towns that sit outside of the Navajo Nation's boundaries. Dine/Navajo people continue to face racism, discrimination and systemic violence, but continue to form resistance against settler colonialism. The United States has acknowledged its history of slavery, but has not yet publicly dealt with the historic violence of settler colonialism. Although settler colonialism is a racial issue, it cannot be reduced simply to racism, and therefore cannot be solved through inclusion alone. Afghanistan Starting from the 1880s, various governments of Afghanistan have pursued policies towards the goal of having more ethnic Pashtuns (Afghans) settle in northern Afghanistan (especially in Afghan Turkestan). These Pashtun colonization policies had three major purposes‚Äîto strengthen Afghanistan government's hold on its northern territories, to allow Afghan governments to deport their opponents up north, and to help economically develop northern Afghanistan. Nepal The native inhabitants of the plains have been the Madheshis. However, due to large planned settlement of Hills people by the King Mahendra of Nepal after construction of a parallel Highway to the existing Hulaki Rajmarg, in many places the native population has been reduced to a minority. Overall the demographic change has been such that a 6% population of people of the hills origin in the plains has risen to 36% in between 1951 & 2011. Vietnam The native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the Degar (Montagnard) peoples. Vietnam conquered and invaded the area during its \\"march to the south\\" (Nam ti·∫øn). Ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) people now outnumber the indigenous Degars after state sponsored colonization directed by both the government of South Vietnam and the current Communist government of unified Vietnam. The Montagnards have fought against and resisted all Vietnamese invaders, from the anti-Communist South Vietnamese government, the Vietcong, to the Communist government of unified Vietnam. The Montagnard lands in the Central Highlands were subjected to state sponsored colonization by ethnic Vietnamese settlers under the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem which resulted in estranging the Montagnards and leading them to reject Vietnamese rule. The South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonization of the Central Highlands have been compared to the historic Nam ti·∫øn of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam ti·∫øn (March to the South) Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonized (ƒë·ªìn ƒëi·ªÅn) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state sponsored colonization of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of \\"New Economic Zones\\" by the now Communist Vietnamese government. Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the Nam ti·∫øn, 1069‚Äì1757). The thousand year violent war the Vietnamese in the lowlands had with the Montagnards in the mountains was a long established custom and the Vietnamese used the derogatory word \\"Moi\\" (savages) to address the Montagnards, the South Vietnamese government was strongly against the autonomous Montagnard CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Groups) who were fighting against the Vietcong because they feared that the Montagnards would gain independence so the South Vietnamese and Montagnards violently clashed against each other. The Vietnamese Communists implemented harsh punishment against the Montagnards after the defeat of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous Montagnards in the CIDG from the Central Highlands as \\"savages\\" and this caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese. The Montagnard Rhades mounted a revolt, seizing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians and soldiers, assassinating officers of the Vietnamese special forces and seizing American advisers on 19‚Äì20 September but the 23rd Division of the South Vietnamese army stopped them from sizing Ban Me Thout, the provincial capital of Darlac Province. The South Vietnamese and Communists \\"victimized\\" the Montagnards. In the Central Highlands the Montagnard FULRO organization fought against both the Communists and South Vietnamese due to discrimination by the South Vietnamese army against the Montagnards. After the victory of the Communist North Vietnamese, the Vietnamese refused autonomy to the Montagnards, and on Montagnard land they settled around one million ethnic Vietnamese in addition to using \\"reducation camps\\" on the Montagnards, leading the Montagnard FULRO to continue the armed struggle against the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard. The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region. Violent demonstrations with fatalities have broken out due to Montagnard anger at Vietnamese discrimination and seizure of their land since many Vietnamese Kinh were settled by the government in the Central Highlands. Long tails and excessive body hair were attributed as physical characteristics of Montagnards in Vietnamese school textbooks in the past. Up until French rule, the Central Highlands was almost never entered by the Vietnamese since they viewed it as a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) populated area with fierce animals like tigers, \\"poisoned water\\" and \\"evil malevolent spirits\\", but with the French transformation of the land into a profitable plantation area for crop growing, its desirability increased to the Vietnamese. in addition to the natural resources from the forests, minerals and rich earth and realization of its crucial geographical importance. Ethnic minorities in general have also been referred to as \\"moi\\", including other \\"hill tribes\\" like the Muong. The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the natives, and settlement of native lands by a massive amount of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous native ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January‚ÄìFebruary 2001 and this event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another. The same state sponsored settlement of ethnic minority land by Vietnamese Kinh has happened in another highland region, the Annamite Cordillera (Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n), both the Central Highlands and Annamite Cordillera were populated by ethnic minorities who were not Vietnamese during the 20th century's start, but the demographics of the highlands was drastically transformed with the mass colonization of 6 million settlers from 1976 to the 1990s, which led to ethnic Vietnamese Kinh outnumbering the native ethnic groups in the highlands. Most of the highlands like the Annamite Range and the Central Highlands were populated by ethnic minorities who were not Vietnamese during the 20th century's start, but the demographics of the highlands was drastically transformed with the mass colonization of 6 million settlers from 1976 to the 1990s, which led to ethnic Vietnamese Kinh outnumbering the native ethnic groups in the highlands. The Vietnamese Kinh dominated government media propagate negative stereotypes of the highlander ethnic minorities, labeling them as \\"ignorant\\", \\"illiterate\\", \\"backward\\" and claim that they are impoverished and underdeveloped because of their own lack of economic and agricultural skills. Ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settlers have negative stereotypes and views of the native ethnic minorities with barely any intermarriage and little interaction since they deliberately choose to live in different villages which are a stark difference from the government's portrayal of harmonic relations between minorities and Vietnamese, with the government claiming that \\"backward areas\\" are experiencing \\"development\\" from the Vietnamese Kinh settlers they are encouraging yet these places are not underdeveloped and no advantages have come about the minorities form the Vietnamese Kinh settlers, instead only negative consequences of the Vietnamese colonization have been brought upon the minorities like the wiping out of their culture and replacement by Vietnamese Kinh culture and exacerbated poverty due to control of the economy by the Vietnamese Kinh. Cham Muslims in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized and pushed into poverty by Vietnamese policies, with ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settling on majority Cham land with state support, and religious practices of minorities have been targeted for elimination by the Vietnamese government. Indonesia Ireland China Map showing the southward migration of the Han Chinese (in blue) The expansion of the Qing Dynasty of China Philippines The native peoples of Mindanao are the Moro Muslims and the Lumad Animists. They have been turned into a minority by the settlement of millions of Filipino Christians from Luzon and the Visayas onto their land. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Moro and Lumads controlled an area which now covers 17 of Mindanao's 24 provinces, but by the 1980 census, they constituted less than 6% of the population of Mindanao and Sulu. Heavy migration to Mindanao of Luzon and Visayans, spurred by government-sponsored resettlement programs,http://www.davaotoday.com/main/todays-views/we-who-seek-to-settle- part-9/ turned the indigenous Lumads and Moros into minorities.\\"Islam and the Politics of Identity\\". University of Hawaii ‚Äì Center for Philippine Studies. The native Moro Muslims and Lumads were supplanted by the first Spanish and American colonization programs with Christian settlers taking control of key areas and disrupting the Muslim's administrative structures and control over resources, the Americans chose Christian settlers to become officials of settler populated townships instead of Lumads and Muslims, with the environment becoming ruined due to the activities of the settlers and logging. Severe deterioration of the land in Mindanao ensued after the continuing influx of Filipino settlers, with the land becoming essentially useless. Eric S. Casi√±o wrote on the interaction between the Filipino settlers, the Moro Muslim and Lumad natives and the impact on the environment in his book \\"Mindanao Statecraft and Ecology: Moros, Lumads, and Settlers Across the Lowland-highland Continuum\\". The Americans started a colonization program on Mindanao for foreign agricultural companies and Filipino Christian settlers against the native Muslims and non-Muslim Lumads of Mindanao, in order to secure the area with a Christian presence and help the American military assert control over the area once it was conquered. 90% of Mindanao's people used to consist of native Moro Muslims at the start of the 20th century but the invasion and colonization sponsored by the American and Philippine governments led to Filipino Christian settlers turning into the majority of almost 75% of the population, with the American colonial government helping to kick natives off their land and giving the land titles to Christian colonists. Media compared the American conquest of the west from the Native Americans to the Filipino conquest and settlement of Mindanao from the Muslims, the Philippine government, Philippine military and Filipino militias used extremely violent tactics against natives to support the settlers. The government agencies involved in settlement on Mindanao were the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) and subsequently the Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO), followed by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA). The Americans used their control over property and land laws to let American corporations and Filipino Christian settlers take over Lumad and Moro Muslim resources and land and depriving them of self-governance after eliminating the sovereignty of the Moro Sultanates, and ignoring Moro requests for their own independence, with the Philippine government continuing the colonization program after independence leading to a humongous number of Filipino settlers streaming into Moro territories, and this led to Moros making moves for independence and armed struggle against the Philippines. After 1960 the settlement program turned the Moro Muslims into a minority from their previous majority in Mindanao, similar to what happened in the Indonesian Transmigration program where frontier areas are settled with ethnic Madurese and Javanese people. The native Moros became victims to land grabs by Filipino Christian settlers.http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/681384/moro- doctors-try-to-heal-sufferinghttp://opinion.inquirer.net/83325/historical- truth-and-bangsamoro-autonomy Severe violence between native Muslims and Christian settlers erupted due to the influx of Christian colonists, companies and other entities seeking to exploit new land on Mindanao who engaged in land grabbing. Lumad and Muslim interests were ignored by the state sponsored colonization program led by the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) which provided benefits for the colonists and made no consideration for the Muslims. Moro Muslims are just 17% of Mindanao's population whereas prior to the colonization program initiated by the governments of the Philippines they had been a massive majority and the colonization and land grabs led to the current violent conflict, with private companies and Filipino colonists from the Visayas and Luzon taking lands from Moro clans with the Philippine government issuing land titles to settlers and ignoring Moro ownership of the land since they declared Moro land as public lands. Massive settlement by Filipino Christian colonists continued after independence was granted and rule passed to Christian Filipinos from the Americans and land disputes the Christian settlers had with the Muslim and tribal natives broke out in violence, eventually the colonization, along with the Jabidah massacre, led to the formation of the Moro National Liberation Front and Moro armed insurgency against Philippine rule. The Philippine government encouraged Filipino Christian settlers in Mindanao to form militias called Ilaga to fight the Moros. The Ilaga engaged in massacres and atrocities and were responsible for Manili massacre of 65 Moro Muslim civilians in a Mosque on June 1971, including women and children. The Ilaga also engaged in cannibalism, cutting off the body parts of their victims to eat in rituals. The Ilaga settlers were given the sarcastic nickname as an acronym, the \\"Ilonggo Land Grabbers' Association\\".http://pcij.org/blog/2015/03/07/ph-souths-separatist-armed-groups The Moros were only incorporated into the Philippines by \\"conquest and colonization\\", constituting a separate nation from Filipinos analogous to the experience of Native Americans who violently resisted American conquest.http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Opinion&title;=should- there-be-a-moro-nation&id;=103716 Bangladesh The CHT were subjected to colonization by Bengalis supported by the government of Bangladesh after independence.

In Africa  = South Africa = In 1652, the arrival of Europeans sparked the beginning of settler colonialism in South Africa. The Dutch East India Company was set up at the Cape, and imported large numbers of slaves from Africa and Asia during the mid-seventeenth century. The Dutch East India Company established a refreshment station for ships sailing between Europe and the east. The initial plan by Dutch East India Company officer Jan van Riebeeck was to maintain a small community around the new fort, but the community continued to spread and colonize further than originally planned. There was a historic struggle to achieve the intended British sovereignty that was achieved in other parts of the commonwealth. State sovereignty belonged to the Union of South Africa (1910-61), followed by the Republic of South Africa (1961-present day). As of 2014, the South African government has re-opened the period for land claims under the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act.

According to a report by the FMEP issued in 2000, the settler population in the West Bank and Gaza strip grew from approximately 1,500 in 1972 to approximately 73,000 in 1989, and more than doubled that in 1998 to approximately 169,000. The report also describes demographics statistics indicating that, by place of birth, 78% of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza were from Europe or America, 19% from Israel.

A number of scholars have objected to the idea that Zionism and the State of Israel are tantamount to settler colonialism. Avi Bareli, in his essay 'Forgetting Europe: Perspectives on the Debate about Zionism and Colonialism', argues that the \\"Colonialist School offered this alternative interpretation to replace the account of the return of the Jewish people to its land\\". Moreover, he asserts that it \\"ignores the economic, social, and cultural processes that spurred the Jews in Eastern Europe to emigrate to Palestine over decades in the twentieth century\\".Bareli, Israeli Historical Revisionism: From Left to Right, pp. 99‚Äì100 Arnon Golan contends that \\"Zionism was not imperialist or colonialist in nature, but a national liberation movement that developed in eastern and central Europe, in conjunction with other national liberation movements in these regions\\" and that \\"Zionism was a diaspora national movement that aspired to promote its interests in the destined homeland through becoming a collaborator of imperial powers.\\"Arnon, Space and Polity, p. 140-141 S. Ilan Troen, in 'De-Judaizing the Homeland: Academic Politics in Rewriting the History of Palestine', argues that Zionism was the repatriation of a long displaced indigenous population to their historic homeland, and that \\"Zionists did not see themselves as foreigners or conquerors, for centuries in the Diaspora they had been strangers\\". Troen further argues that there are several differences between European colonialism and the Zionist movement, including that \\"there is no New Vilna, New Bialystock, New Warsaw, New England, New York,...and so on\\" in Israel. He writes that \\"mandates were intended to nurture the formation of new states until independence and this instrument was to be applied to Jews, even as it was for the Arab peoples of Syria and Iraq. In this view, Jews were a people not only entitled to a state but that polity was naturally located in a part of the world in which they had originated, had been resident since the ancient world, and still constituted a vital presence in many areas of the region, including Palestine\\" and that \\"perhaps the most manifest or visible evidence‚Äîfor those who would be willing to acknowledge‚Äîwere found in the revival of Hebrew into a living language; the marking the landscape with a Jewish identity; and the development of an indigenous culture with roots in the ancient past.\\" He concludes that \\"casting Zionists as colonizers serves to present them as occupiers in a land to which, by definition, they do not belong.\\" See also * Colonialism * Exploitation colonialism * Expansionism * Human migration * Imperialism * Frontier * Frontier Thesis * Indian removal * Lebensraum * List of diasporas * Internal colonialism * Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation * Colony Further reading * Settler Colonial Studies articles in Western American Literature * *Settler Colonialism in the Twentieth Century (edited by Susan Pedersen and Caroline Elkins, Routledge, 2005) * Irwin J.

Exploitation colonialism is the national economic policy of conquering a country to exploit its population as labour and its natural resources as raw material. The practice of exploitation colonialism contrasts with settler colonialism, the policy of conquering a country to establish a branch of the metropole (motherland). A reason for which a country might practice exploitation colonialism is the immediate financial gain produced by the low-cost extraction of raw materials by means of a native people, usually administered by a colonial government. The geopolitics of an Imperialist power determine which of these colonial practices it will follow. In the example of the British Empire, colonists settled mainly in northern North America and in Australia, where the native populations declined due to disease and violence in the course of establishing a facsimile society of the metropole, the abuse of the Thirteen Colonies caused the American Revolution. Whereas the densely populated countries of the British Raj (1858‚Äì1947), in the Indian subcontinent, and the British occupation of Egypt and South Africa, as well as the island of Barbados, were ruled by a small populace of colonial administrators (colonial government) that redirected the local economies to exploitation management to supply the metropole with food, raw materials, and some finished goods. Exploitation was often reinforced by colonial European geographers who implemented theories such as environmental determinism, which suggested warmer climates produced less civilized people. These theories were among the scholarly canon that helped legitimize colonial activity and expansion into overseas territories. Geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel suggested that the survival of empire relied on its ability to expand its control and influence around the world. By implying a correlation between colonial expansion and national success, geographers were able to produce a sense of nationalism within many European nations. Their influence created a sense of pride that was able to reassure subjects that their nation's activity abroad was beneficial to not only them, but that their presence was necessary within the territories being occupied. Barbados was claimed for the English in 1625 by Captain John Powell, and by the 1660s the English had come to regard Barbados as being by far and away their most highly prized possession anywhere in the New World. The island's value to England, and the enormous wealth of a minority of its English inhabitants, hinged on the relationship that had been forged during the previous twenty years between sugar and slavery.

In his Prefaces, Lenin states that the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) was \\"an annexationist, predatory, plunderous war\\"\\"Imperialism and Capitalism\\" in the Communist International, No. 18, October 1921. p. 3. http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1916lenin-imperialism.html#bm3. among empires, whose historical and economic background must be studied \\"to understand and appraise modern war and modern politics\\".\\"Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism Preface April 26, 1917. http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1916lenin-imperialism.html. In order for capitalism to generate greater profits than the home market can yield, the merging of banks and industrial cartels produces finance capitalism and the exportation and investment of capital to countries with underdeveloped economies is required. In turn, such financial behaviour leads to the division of the world among monopolist business companies and the great powers. Moreover, in the course of colonizing undeveloped countries, business and government eventually will engage in geopolitical conflict over the economic exploitation of large portions of the geographic world and its populaces. Therefore, imperialism is the highest (advanced) stage of capitalism, requiring monopolies (of labour and natural-resource exploitation) and the exportation of finance capital (rather than goods) to sustain colonialism, which is an integral function of said economic model.Paul Bowles (2007) Capitalism, Pearson: London. pp. 91‚Äì93Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism III. Finance Capital and the Financial Oligarchy Furthermore, in the capitalist homeland, the super-profits yielded by the colonial exploitation of a people and their economy permit businessmen to bribe native politicians, labour leaders and the labour aristocracy (upper stratum of the working class) to politically thwart worker revolt (labour strike). Theoretical development Lenin's socio-political analysis of empire as the ultimate stage of capitalism derived from Imperialism: A Study (1902) by John A. Hobson, an English economist, and Finance Capital (Das Finanzcapital, 1910) by Rudolf Hilferding, an Austrian Marxist, whose synthesis Lenin applied to the new geopolitical circumstances of the First World War, wherein capitalist imperial competition had provoked global war among the various colonial powers of Europe. Three years earlier, in 1914, rival Marxist Karl Kautsky proposed a theory of capitalist coalition, wherein the imperial powers would unite and subsume their nationalist and economic antagonisms to a system of ultra- imperialism, whereby they would jointly effect the colonialist exploitation of the underdeveloped world. Lenin countered Kautsky by proposing that the balance of power among the imperial capitalist states continually changed, thereby disallowing the political unity of ultra-imperialism, and that such instability motivated competition and conflict, rather than co-operation: The post-War edition of Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1920) identified the territorially punitive Russo‚ÄìGerman Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918) and the Allied‚ÄìGerman Treaty of Versailles (1919) as proofs that empire and hegemony‚Äînot nationalism‚Äîwere the economic motivations for the First World War.Christopher Read (2005) Lenin. London: Routledge. pp. 116‚Äì126 In the preface to the French and German editions of the essay, Lenin proposed that revolt against the capitalist global system would be effected with the \\"thousand million people\\" of the colonies and semi-colonies (the system's weak points), rather than with the urban workers of the industrialised societies of Western Europe.Vladimir Lenin (2000) Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism pp. 37‚Äì38 He proposed that revolution would extend to the advanced (industrial) capitalist countries from the underdeveloped countries, such as Tsarist Russia, where he and the Bolsheviks had successfully seized political command of the October Revolution of 1917.Christopher Read (2005) Lenin. London: Routledge. pp. 116‚Äì126 In political praxis, Lenin expected to realise the theory of Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism via the Third International (1919‚Äì1943), which he intellectually and politically dominated in the July and August conferences of 1920.Prabhat Patnaik (2000) \\"Introduction\\" to Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, by Lenin. New Dehli, Leftword Books. pp. 10‚Äì11  Intellectual influence  Immanuel Wallerstein, an exponent of the World-systems theory. (ca. 2008) Lenin's use of Hobson pre-figured the core‚Äìperiphery model of unequal capitalist development and exploitation. He argued in the preface to the 1920 edition of Imperialism, the structural causes of the reformist failure; that imperialism afforded ‚Äòsuperprofits‚Äô to the capitalists of the advanced countries and that Making use of English economist J. A. Hobson's work, Lenin understood capitalism as world system of unequal development that created the reformist labor aristocracy in industrial countries: Lenin specifically used the term \\"world system,\\" which, combined with his use of J. A. Hobson and Rudolf Hilferding to emphasize the global accumulation of wealth among colonizing countries, was an insight into the global dimensions of capitalism. Such ideas were early contributions to the development of world-systems theory, but similar ideas are found in Marx's work as well. Immanuel Wallerstein adopted the term \\"world-systems\\" from Ferdinand Braudel's concept of the Mediterranean \\"world-economy\\" and applied it to the \\"capitalist world-economy\\" which is also known as \\"the modern world-system\\" as an entity that is a \\"world\\" not necessarily global in size, though it eventually became global in size, and that is a \\"system\\" through the integrated functioning of a division of labor manifest in zones: core countries, semi-periphery countries, and periphery countries. The core‚Äìperiphery expression originated in dependency theory, whose proponents Ra√∫l Prebisch, Andre Gunder Frank and Fernando Henrique Cardoso proposed that countries and colonies become peripheral zones because they specialize in the low tech and labor-intensive activities, including the supply of raw materials and cheap labor to core zone areas, and thus become \\"underdeveloped\\" through unequal exchange mechanisms consequent to colonization and/or imperialism.John Baylis and Steve Smith (2005) The Globalization of World Politics.

While it may belong to a tradition of spring festivals, the date was chosen in 1889 for political reasons by the Marxist International Socialist Congress, which met in Paris and established the Second International as a successor to the earlier International Workingmen's Association. They adopted a resolution for a \\"great international demonstration\\" in support of working-class demands for the eight-hour day. The date had been chosen by the American Federation of Labor to continue an earlier campaign for the eight-hour day in the United States, which had culminated in the Haymarket affair, which occurred in Chicago on 4 May 1886. May Day subsequently became an annual event.

In that year beginning on 1 May, there was a general strike for the eight-hour workday. On 4 May, the police acted to disperse a public assembly in support of the strike when an unidentified person threw a bomb. The police responded by firing on the workers. The event led to the deaths of seven police officers and at least thirty-eight civilians; sixty police officers were injured, as were one hundred and fifteen civilians.

The following day on 5 May, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the state militia fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard. In 1889, a meeting in Paris was held by the first congress of the Second International, following a proposal by Raymond Lavigne that called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. May Day was formally recognized as an annual event at the International's second congress in 1891. Subsequently, the May Day riots of 1894 occurred.

In 1882, Matthew Maguire, a machinist, first proposed a Labor Day holiday on the first Monday of September while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union (CLU) of New York. Others argue that it was first proposed by Peter J. McGuire of the American Federation of Labor in May 1882, after witnessing the annual labour festival held in Toronto, Canada. In 1887, Oregon was the first state of the United States to make it an official public holiday. By the time it became an official federal holiday in 1894, thirty US states officially celebrated Labor Day.

A 1 May rally in Bucharest in 1967 May Day has been a focal point for demonstrations by various socialist, communist and anarchist groups since the Second International. May Day is one of the most important holidays in communist countries such as China, North Korea, Cuba and the former Soviet Union countries. May Day celebrations in these countries typically feature elaborate workforce parades, including displays of military hardware and soldiers. In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated 1 May to \\"Saint Joseph the Worker\\". Saint Joseph is the patron saint of workers and craftsmen, among others. Today, the majority of countries around the world celebrate a workers' day on 1 May. Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc under communist governments May Day rally in Moscow, 1 May 1960 Eastern Bloc countries such as the Soviet Union and most countries of central and eastern Europe that were under the rule of Marxist-Leninist governments held official May Day celebrations in every town and city, during which party leaders greeted the crowds. Workers carried banners with political slogans and many companies decorated their company cars. The biggest celebration of 1 May usually occurred in the capital of a particular communist country and usually included a military display and the presence of the president and the secretary general of the party. During the Cold War, May Day became the occasion for large military parades in Red Square by the Soviet Union and attended by the top leaders of the Kremlin, especially the Politburo, atop Lenin's Mausoleum. It became an enduring symbol of that period. In Poland, since 1982, party leaders led the official parades. In Hungary, May Day was officially celebrated under the communist regime, and remains a public holiday. Traditionally, the day was marked by dancing around designated \\"May trees\\". Some factories in communist countries were named in honour of International Workers' Day, such as 1 Maja Coal Mine in , Poland. In East Germany, the holiday was officially known as ' (\\"International Day of the Struggle and Celebration of the Workers for Peace and Socialism\\"); similar names were used in other Eastern Bloc countries.

May Day started to get more attention by African workers in 1928, which saw thousands of workers in a mass march. In 1950, the South African Communist Party called for a strike on 1 May in response to the Suppression of Communism Act declaring it illegal. Police violence caused the death of 18 people across Soweto. It has its origins within the historical struggles of workers and their trade unions internationally for solidarity between working people in their struggles to win fair employment standards and more importantly, to establish a culture of human and worker rights and to ensure that these are enshrined in international law and the national law. In 1986, the hundredth anniversary of the Haymarket affair, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) called for the government to establish an official holiday on 1 May. It also called for workers to stay home from work that day. COSATU was joined by a number of prominent anti-apartheid organizations, including the National Education Crisis Committee and the United Democratic Front (South Africa). The call was also supported by a number of organizations regarded as conservative, such as the African Teachers Association, the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, and the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa, an organization that represented employers in the metal industries. More than 1,500,000 workers observed the call and stayed home, as did thousands of students, taxi drivers, vendors, shopkeepers, domestic workers, and self-employed people. In the following years, 1 May became a popular, if not official, holiday.

He served as the adviser on Israel under international law to Yuval Ne'eman while Ne'eman was the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure in the Yitzhak Shamir Government. Biography Howard Grief was born and educated in Montreal, Quebec, Canada where he attended Baron Byng High School, McGill University, and McGill Law School, obtaining degrees in Arts and Law. He became a member of the Bar of Quebec in 1966 and was a self-employed practicing attorney for 23 years, principally in the fields of civil and commercial law.In August 1989, Grief immigrated to Israel together with his Jerusalem-born wife and their two sons. In May 1991, he was admitted to the Israel Bar Association and subsequently became a notary. In December 1991, he was formally appointed by Yuval Ne'eman, then Minister of Energy and Infrastructure in the Yitzhak Shamir Government, to be his legal adviser in international law on matters pertaining to the Land of Israel. Legal career In May 1991, Grief was admitted to the Israel Bar Association and became a notary. In December 1991, he was appointed by Yuval Ne'eman, then Minister of Energy and Infrastructure in the Yitzhak Shamir Government, to be his legal adviser in international law on matters pertaining to the Land of Israel. He petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to annul the Oslo Accords in 1999, and advanced the thesis that de jure sovereignty over all of Palestine was devolved upon the Jewish People at the 1920 San Remo Peace conference. He is the author of the book The Legal Foundation and Borders of Israel under International Law published in 2008, as well as of numerous articles mainly published in the Ariel Center for Policy Research's journal Nativ. Views and opinions In 1999, Grief presented the \\"Petition to Annul the Interim Agreement\\" to Israel's Supreme Court claiming that the agreements between Israel and the PLO were illegal both under constitutional and criminal Israeli law. The Supreme Court called the petition \\"a political position\\" and would not deal with it. Grief drew attention to the wider scope of the 1920 San Remo conference, His thesis was that de jure sovereignty over the entire Land of Israel (Palestine) was vested in the Jewish People as a result of the reference to the Balfour Declaration, adopted at the San Remo Conference in April 1920. Grief maintained that Israeli politicians and jurists, including the authors of the 2012 Levy Report failed to grasp the full importance of the \\"San Remo Resolution\\", a term he coined to clarify his position, according to the Algemeiner.

Nevertheless, the couple treated their union as a marriage and Laura was known as Baroness von Wallburg and their four children who were baptised with the surname 'von Wallburg'.

Timeline 2012 At the beginning of the summer 2012, two Hezbollah fighters were killed in a clash with Syrian rebels who were on Lebanese territory. On 17 September, Syrian Ground-attack aircraft fired three missiles over the border into Lebanese territory near Arsal. It was suggested that the jets were chasing rebels in the vicinity. The attack prompted Lebanese president Michel Sleiman to launch an investigation, whilst not publicly blaming Syria for the incident. On 22 September, a group of armed members of the Free Syrian Army attacked a border post near Arsal. This was reported to be the second incursion within a week. The group were chased off into the hills by the Lebanese Army, who detained and later released some rebels due to pressure from dignified locals. Michel Sleiman praised the actions taken by the military as maintaining Lebanon's position being \\"neutral from the conflicts of others\\". He called on border residents to \\"stand beside their army and assist its members.\\" Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns. On 11 October 2012, four shells fired by the Syrian military hit Masharih al-Qaa, where previous shelling incidents have caused fatalities. Lebanon's position of ignoring the attacks and dissociating itself from the conflict remained unchanged. On 30 November 2012, between 14 and 20 Islamists from North Lebanon, as well a Palestinian, were killed in an ambush in Tall Kalakh near the Lebanese border. They had gone to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian rebels.  2013  On 1 February 2013, two Lebanese soldiers were killed, along with 1-2 militants, and six were wounded in clashes near the Syrian border which started after an attempt by the military to arrest an anti-Assad rebel commander, who was also killed.Soldiers in Lebanon Die in Raid Near Syria Three Lebanese soldiers were killed in an attack on their checkpoint near the border town of Arsal by unknown militants who than fled over the border into Syria.Violence in Lebanese Border Towns Adds to Fears of Syrian Encroachment In the night of 2 June 2013, heavy clashes between Syrian rebels and Hezbollah took place near the Lebanese town of Ain el-Jaouze, which is close to the border area between Lebanon and Syria. The rebels were ether members of the radical Al-Nusra Front or of the Free Syrian Army. Hezbollah fighters attacked a rebel rocket team which was reportedly preparing to fire rockets into Shi'ite areas of the Lebanese Beqaa Valley. 14‚Äì17 rebels and one Hezbollah fighter were killed. The rebels said the attack was in retaliation for Hezbollah's support for the Syrian Army at the battle of al-Qusayr. On 6 June 2013, unknown gunmen attacked a Lebanese Army checkpoint in Arsal, near the border. In the ensuing gunfight two of the gunmen were killed. The Army captured a pick-up truck that contained weapons and ammunition. After examining the bodies, it was determined that at least one of the dead gunmen was a Syrian national. The nationality of the other dead man was not stated. 2014 On June 14, 2014, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah fighters bombed the village of Tfeil in the Bekka valley causing much damage to people and property. On 14 July, Hezbollah fighters launched an attack on Syrian rebels holding out on the border with Lebanon between Qalamoun and Arsal, killing three rebels and wounding ten. The clashes left one fighter from Hezbollah dead and twelve others wounded. The fighting moved into Lebanon outside the town of Nahleh, with fighting killing an additional seven Hezbollah fighters and 32 rebels. On 16 July, Al Nusra Front ambushed Hezbollah fighters attempting to enter Al Qalamoun from Lebanon, leaving three of them dead. By this time, it was estimated that 26 Al Nusra Front fighters had been killed. On 17 July, fierce clashes broke out between Hezbollah fighters and Al Nusra Front fighters on the outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal and Al-Fakiha. Hezbollah reportedly captured seven Al Nusra Front fighters. The fighting continued into the next day, with Syrian jets and Hezbollah bombarding rebel positions stretching from Arsal to Nanleh. Arsal residents were apparently being coerced into allowing fighters to rest there, and many civilians from Lebanese border villages had been kidnapped. On 2 August, Al Nusra Front leader Emad Jumaa was detained by Lebanese authorities at a checkpoint near Arsal. Al Nusra Front fighters, still reeling from an ambush orchestrated by pro-Syrian forces across the border, promptly surrounded Lebanese army checkpoints around the town and demanded his release. The army refused, and Al Nusra Front, backed by fighters from the Islamic State, stormed Arsal and captured the police station. Clashes broke out in and around the town between the militants and the Lebanese army, leaving 11 militants and 7 soldiers dead. The Lebanese army began to shell the town throughout the night, as Al Nusra Front detained 16 members of the local security forces. From the second to the fifth fierce battles raged, lasting until the Jihadi army withdrew back into Syria on the fifth, capturing dozens of hostages, which were later used as bargaining chips. Desperate battles between Al Nusra Front and Hezbollah fighters took place on the Syrian side of the border, spilling over into the Arsal area again on 21 August. On August 26, Syrian bombers targeted suspected rebel outposts on the Lebanese side of the border, beginning an offensive that inadvertently involved Lebanese troops, threatening to turn the Bekka valley into major battlefield of a regional war. On 16 September, Al-Nusra Front fighters crossed into Lebanon after clashing with the Syrian army. The Lebanese army repelled them, killing and wounding an unverified number. On 19 September, two Lebanese soldiers were killed and three were wounded when a bomb exploded as their convoy was headed towards the outskirts of Arsal. On 2 December, six Lebanese soldiers were killed and one wounded in an ambush by unknown gunmen in the Tal Hamra area of Ras Baalbek, near the border with Syria.Lebanese troops killed near Syrian border 2015 On 23 January, eight soldiers were killed and 22 wounded near Ras Baalbek after their outpost near the border was attacked by Al Nusra.

There were several prominent kinds of music in the 1870s. U.S. and North America Traditional Folk Music Traditional folk songs were some of the most popular fare of this decade. While the American Civil War was over and the conflict was healing much of the passion from that era remained in these post-war songs. Many of the songs most remembered today from this decade are prime examples of this tradition well. Some of this decades' hits were the songs which are seen today including \\"Good-bye, Liza Jane\\", \\"My Grandfather's Clock\\" and \\"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\\". These songs carried a large amount of more philosophical and emotional content than say \\"Camptown Races\\" which was a major hit before the war. This was likely one of the reasons that so many American folk songs from this period are remembered today. C.A. White wrote many great songs of the era such as \\"Marguerite\\", \\"Moonlight on the Lake\\", \\"When 'Tis Moonlight\\", and \\"The Fisherman and His Child\\". Songs such as \\"Barney, Take Me Home Again\\" and \\"I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen\\" were designed to go together. Folk songs were also used in political campaigns as they long had been before the era of television. Rutherford B. Hayes used the song \\"The Boys in Blue will see it Through\\" as his campaign song. This was a new era of passion in music. While the mainstream saw many sorts of songs after the war there were also the kind of songs which formed part of another group. There were many songs of the folk genre in this time period. Choruses continued their evolution to be the major part of a song in this period. In songs before this, the chorus is not any more important than the verses. This is a major change which characterizes folk music from the 1870s. Political Protest Songs As in later decades, the 1870s saw many songs which were designed to get the listeners to support a certain political point of view or perspective. This was the dawn of a new musical genre which has been influencing a good deal of music in the modern world as well. The big things which inspired protests in this time were prohibiting alcohol, which became a major goal of the progressive era, especially among Republicans. These included hits such as \\"Sons of Temperance\\" and \\"Let Us Pass This Goodly Measure\\". Some were militant and others sentimental, often dealing with the perspective of the abused child of an alcoholic. On the other side were songs like \\"Now Suppose You Pass This Measure\\" and songs which showed children in Poverty while their parents attended temperance meetings. These were intended to mock temperance. There were also those who supported allowing women to vote, which became a theme in certain political songs such as \\"Daughters of Freedom! The Ballot be Yours\\" These suffrage songs gained much publicity in the United States, though many were since lost due to copyright issues. In short, political causes became a major theme in popular music for the first time in the 1870s, with the exception of campaign songs for candidates which were already a major musical genre and remained so until the 1950s when they were largely replaced by television. Broadway This was the first decade in which there was competition from numbers originally written for the stage. Before this, the closest thing to that was opera. Opera often was in foreign languages such as German, Italian, and French. The musical took form in 1866 with The Black Crook opening on Broadway. The show Out of Bondage was a big hit in this decade as it helped spread a noble image of reconstruction. This was a new genre which would come into greater prominence until it became the largest segment of the music industry in the Tin Pan Alley era. The Tin Pan Alley era had of course not begun yet and the influence of Broadway musicals on popular music at the time was no more than that of opera. U.K. and Europe British Music Hall The 1870s saw the expansion of the British Music Hall genre. Those who wrote music began more than ever to write them for live performances. It was an era of light music. The well-known composer G. H. MacDermott was known for his dedication to themes which were not appropriate at the time which led many to ban his work. This was an important period of transition in English music as it went from the focus on rotating pieces in performance to the era of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.

Details At the start of the Peasants' Revolt in June 1381, John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north from Essex towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.; Wrawe had considerable influence over the development of the revolt across eastern England. The number of rebels in the eastern counties, then a very populous region, may have approached those in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited men may also have proved unreliable in the face of a popular uprising.; On 12 June, Wrawe attacked Sir Richard Lyons' property at Overhall, advancing on to the towns of Cavendish and Bury St Edmunds in west Suffolk the next day, gathering further support as they went. John Cambridge, the prior of the wealthy Bury St Edmunds Abbey, was disliked in the town, and Wrawe allied himself with the townspeople and stormed the abbey. The prior escaped, but was found two days later and executed.; A small band of rebels marched north to Thetford to extort protection money from the town, and another group tracked down Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.; Cavendish was caught in Lakenheath and executed. On 15 June, revolt broke out in Cambridgeshire, led by elements of Wrawe's Suffolk rebellion and some local men, such as John Greyston, who had been involved in the events in London and had returned to his home county to spread the revolt, and Geoffrey Cobbe and John Hanchach, members of the local gentry. The University of Cambridge, staffed by priests and enjoying special royal privileges, was widely hated by the other inhabitants of the town. A revolt broke out in Cambridge with the University as its main target, backed up by the Mayor of Cambridge. The rebels ransacked Corpus Christi College, which had connections to John of Gaunt, and the University's church, and attempted to execute the University bedel, who escaped. The University's library and archives were burnt in the centre of the town. The next day, the University was forced to agree a new charter, giving up its royal privileges. Revolt then spread north from Cambridge toward Ely, where the gaol was opened and the local Justice of the Peace executed. As the revolt was suppressed, John Wrawe was captured and was tried in London. He probably gave evidence against 24 of his colleagues in the hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382.; References Bibliography * * * Category:1382 deaths Category:English rebels Category:Peasants' Revolt Category:English tax resisters Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"John Wrawe"},{"id":"39353192","text":"The decorations at the funeral The funeral of King Gustav III of Sweden took place on 14 May 1792.

The play takes the story of Jack Straw, a rebel leader in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The play was possibly written by George Peele and probably originally designed for production in one of London's guild pageants. The play portrays Jack Straw as a tragic figure, being led into wrongful rebellion by the priest John Ball, drawing clear allegorical links between the instability of late-Elizabethan England and the politics of the 14th century. It is one of the earliest political plays of its type in England. The play was initially printed in 1593 by John Danter for William Barley, and the rights were subsequently transferred to Thomas Pavier, who printed a new edition in 1604. There is no record of performance from the early modern period contained in either edition. Performances in the modern era are rare.

Russell Williams (Textiles) Limited,Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd (t/a Washington DC), [2001] E.C.D.R. 10 is a leading House of Lords case on what constitutes copying in copyright infringement cases. The House of Lords considered whether there was infringement of a fabric design. Although both the copyrighted work and the infringing design were different in detail, the overall impression of the designs was the same. This decision is significant because the House of Lords ruled that copyright infringement is dependent on whether the defendant copied a substantial portion of the original work, rather than whether the two works look the same. The outcome suggests that in the United Kingdom the overall impression of a copyrighted work is protected if the copied features involved the labour, skill and originality of the author's work, even if the copyrighted work and infringing work are different in detail.  Background of case  Designer Guild Limited (‚ÄúDGL‚Äù) and Russell Williams (Textiles) Limited (‚ÄúRWT‚Äù) both design and sell fabrics and wallpapers. DGL held a copyright in its Ixia design. DGL accused RWT of copyright infringement, alleging that the RWT design, Marguerite, copied Ixia. Both designs included a combination of flowers and stripes, a similar style of painting, and use of the resist effect (part of the stripe color shows through the flower petals). Under section 16(3) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, infringement will be found if there is copying of the work as a whole or any substantial part of it. There were two issues at the trial: *Did the designers of Marguerite copy from the Ixia design? *Did what had been copied amount to the whole or substantial part of Ixia? The deputy judge of the Chancery Division found that RWT's Marguerite design had been copied from DGL's Ixia design and that there had been copying of a substantial part. The judge identified the copied features as: the combination and relation of flowers and stripes, the manner in which they were painted, and the ‚Äúresist effect‚Äù. The judge determined that the combination of these features formed a substantial part of the Ixia design. On appeal, RWT challenged the judge's finding that the copied features formed a substantial part of the Ixia design. The issue of copying was not challenged. The Court of Appeal upheld RWT's challenge to the finding of substantiality.Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd (t/a Washington DC), [2000] F.S.R. 121 DGL appealed.  The Court's decision  The House of Lords allowed DGL's appeal, finding no reason to interfere with the judge's decision.  Lord Bingham of Cornhill  Lord Bingham of Cornhill found that the Court of Appeal erred in overruling the decision of the judge because: *The Court of Appeal's analysis of the dissimilarities between the two designs failed to give effect to the judge's finding that there had been copying, which was not an issue on appeal. This was in error because a finding of copying was crucial to concluding the issue of substantiality. *The Court of Appeal inappropriately addressed the issue of substantiality in the manner of a first instance court. Lord Hope of Craighead agreed with these reasons and also allowed the appeal.  Lord Hoffmann  Lord Hoffmann found that the Court of Appeal erred in overruling the decision of the judge because: *The Court of Appeal wrongfully engaged in a visual comparison. The issue was whether the features which the judge found to be copied from the Ixia designed formed a substantial part of this work. Once these features had been identified, there was no need to revisit whether or not the two designs looked alike. *The Court of Appeal erred by dissecting the component parts of the designs, rather than considering their cumulative effect because it ignored the judge's findings of fact. *The Court of Appeal erred in its belief that the defendant did not copy a substantial part of the expression of the Ixia design, but rather the idea. The techniques used in Ixia to form the expression required sufficient skill and labor from the author for the judge to find that they formed a substantial part of the originality of Ixia. *The judge was in a better position to assess the substantiality issue because he assessed the credibility of the expert witnesses with experience identifying which features of the design produce a specific visual effect. Lord Hoffmann provided guidance on the concept that British copyright law protects the expression of the idea rather than the idea itself. He noted two propositions about the distinction between ideas and expression: # \\"The first is that a copyright work may express certain ideas which are not protected because they have no connection with the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic nature of the work. . . . However striking or original [the idea] may be, others are (in the absence of patent protection) free to express it in works of their own.\\" # \\"The other proposition is that certain ideas expressed by a copyright work may not be protected because, although they are ideas of a literary, dramatic or artistic nature, they are not original, or so commonplace as not to form a substantial part of the work.\\" Lord Hoffmann concluded that the Ixia expression was more than just the idea of a flower-stripe combination, and therefore original enough to represent the author's skill and labour and form a substantial part of the originality of the work. A writer for the European Intellectual Property Review explained that while he did not explicitly state it, Lord Hoffmann provided a new test for whether a substantial part of the original work was copied. The proposed test is whether the part taken would itself attract copyright protection.Mark Chacksfield, E.I.P.R. 2001, 23(5), 261.  Lord Millett  Lord Millett found that the Court of Appeal erred overruling the decision of the judge because: *The Court of Appeal did not agree with the judge's finding that the work had been copied and as a result were too quick to reject the judge's finding of substantiality, which as a matter of impression, appellate courts should hesitate to do. *The Court of Appeal erred in its understanding of the visual comparison. The question of substantiality addresses whether the copied feature is a substantial part of the copyrighted work. It may not be a substantial part of the defendant's work. Therefore, even if the defendant's design looked different from Ixia, it does not mean that the copyright was not infringed.

With the partition of India in 1947, railways in Assam got delinked from that of the rest of India. Indian Railway took up the Assam Link Project in 1948 to build a metre-gauge rail link between Fakiragram and Kishanganj. Fakiragram was connected to the Indian railway system in 1950. In the mid 1960s, the first -wide broad gauge line was laid in the area from New Jalpaiguri to Jogihopa via New Bongaigaon. The Fakiragram‚ÄìDhubri line was opened in September 2010 after conversion to broad gauge. Up to the sixties there was a railway link from Cooch Behar to Dhubri via Golokganj. It was then known as the Assam Line Railway Service. It also connected East Pakistan, even after partition. However, collapse of the rail-cum-road bridge over the Gadadhar in the seventies ended that link. The bridge has been rebuilt and the track laid again as broad gauge, entirely through Indian territory. The line became operable in 2012. Dhubri-New Jalpaiguri Inter-city Express via New Cooch Behar was introduced in February 2012. Note: The map alongside presents the position as it stands today (2020). The international border was not there when the railways were first laid in the area in the 19th-20th century. It came up in 1947. Since then, it has been an effort to live up to the new realities.

During 1377, protests began to break out in south- east and south-west England. Rural workers organised themselves into protest groups and refused to work for their lords, arguing that, according to the Domesday Book, they were exempt from requests for feudal labour services. This argument depended on the legal concept of ancient demesne, and their belief that the Domesday Book was an accurate reflection of early land tenure agreements. Unsuccessful appeals and petitions were made both to the law courts and to King Richard II. The events of the Great Rumour closely resembled much of the subsequent Peasants' Revolt of 1381.

She was laid down on 2 February 1917 by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Govan, Scotland, and launched on 29 October 1917. She was completed on 19 December 1917 and commissioned into service the same day. Her original pennant number, F9A, was changed to F93 in January 1918 and to F14 in April 1918. It became D53 during the interwar period.Naval History: SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY, 1914-1919 - in ALPHABETICAL ORDER (Part 2 of 2) Service history World War I The V- and W-class destroyers, Venetia among them, were assigned to the Grand Fleet or Harwich Force and saw service in the last year of World War I. Interwar years In 1921, as part of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Venetia joined the light cruisers , , , and and the destroyers , , , , , , and in a Baltic cruise. Departing the United Kingdom on 31 August 1921, the ships crossed the North Sea and transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to enter the Baltic, where they called at Danzig in the Free City of Danzig; Memel in the Klaipƒóda Region; LiepƒÅja, Latvia; Riga, Latvia; Tallinn, Estonia; Helsinki, Finland; Stockholm, Sweden; Copenhagen, Denmark; Gothenburg, Sweden; and Kristiania, Norway, before crossing the North Sea and ending the voyage at Port Edgar, Scotland, on 15 October 1921.Naval History: HMS VANQUISHER, BALTIC CRUISE 1921 Venetia later served in the Home Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet before being decommissioned and placed in the Reserve Fleet. World War II When the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, Venetia was recommissioned. In October 1939, she began service escorting convoys in the North Atlantic Ocean. On 6 January 1940, she and Winchelsea joined Convoy OG 13 in the Southwestern Approaches to serve as its escort during the first leg of its voyage to Gibraltar. The two destroyers detached from the convoy on 8 January 1940 and joined Convoy HG 13 to escort it on the final leg of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool, where it arrived on 10 January 1940. On 1 March 1940, she and the sloop joined Convoy OG 20 in the Southwestern Approaches to escort it during the first day of its voyage to Gibraltar. The two warships detached the following day and joined Convoy HG 23 to relieve the sloop as its escort on the final leg of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool, detaching on 6 March 1940. On 7 April 1940, Venetia, the destroyer and the sloops and joined Convoy HG24 as its escort for the final stage of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool. In May 1940, Venetia was transferred to Nore Command for operations related to the evacuation of Allied personnel from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France because of the successful German offensive there. On 12 May, in Operation J, she and the destroyer escorted the destroyer as Codrington transported the Dutch Royal Family from the Hook of Holland into exile in the United Kingdom. On 23 May 1940, Venetia and the destroyers , , , and arrived off Boulogne, France, to evacuate troops of the British Armys Irish Guards and Welsh Guards, who had been trapped there by advancing German troops and tanks of the 2nd Panzer Division during the Battle of Boulogne. Sixty German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers had recently attacked the harbour and French destroyers bombarding offshore, so they awaited the arrival of Royal Air Force fighter cover before attempting to enter the harbour. After it arrived at 19:20 hours, Whitshed and Vimiera entered the harbour first, taking aboard as many British soldiers as possible - over 550 men each - under fire from German forces before steaming back out of the harbour at 20:25 hours, with Whitshed completely destroying two German tanks at point-blank range with her 4.7-inch (120-mm) guns as she departed.Sebag-Montefiore, Hugh, Dunkirk: Fight To the Last Man, Harvard University Press, 2006, pp. 208-209, 593-594. Venomous and Wild Swan entered the harbour next, at 20:35 hours, followed by Venetia at 20:40 hours. The Germans opened fire on Venetia with heavier guns as she entered the harbour, apparently in an attempt to sink her in the harbour entrance to trap Venomous and Wild Swan and bring the evacuation operation to an end. A German shell, probably from a tank, hit Venetia, starting a fire aft and prompting her crew to jettison her torpedoes and burning Carley floats. Another shell hit her \\"B\\" gun turret, blowing overboard and killing some of the men there, and German gunfire also inflicted casualties among the men on her bridge, causing her to go out of control and briefly run aground. Gunners aboard Venomous, seeing that Venetia was in danger of being sunk, realized that the Germans had captured Fort de la Cr√®che on a hill overlooking the entrance and were using its coastal artillery to fire on Venetia. Venomous opened fire on the fort; her first salvo went over it, but her second salvo blew off one side of the fort and much of the hillside it was on, causing artillery pieces to roll down the hill and silencing the fort. Venomous also detected a German light field gun in the garden of a house and fired on it; her first salvo flattened all of the trees in the garden, set the house on fire, and caused German troops in the vicinity to flee. All heavy German guns fell silent after this and, given a reprieve, Venetia, which had taken seven hits and been unable to embark any troops, quickly refloated herself and backed out of the harbor at full speed at 20:48 hours. Venomous and Wild Swan followed Venetia out of the harbour, also in reverse, carrying about 400 evacuees each, along the way knocking out a German tank and shooting up two German troop columns, then escorted the damaged Venetia to Dover, England. After spending the summer of 1940 undergoing repairs, Venetia returned to Nore Command in August 1940 and began convoy defence and patrol duties in the North Sea and Thames Estuary in September 1940. On 19 October 1940, she struck a mine off Knob Buoy in the Thames Estuary 12 nautical miles (22 km) northwest of Margate, Kent, England, and sank at either or (sources differ).

The Yongle Emperor started building the treasure fleet in 1403. The grand project resulted in seven far- reaching ocean voyages to the coastal territories and islands in and around the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, and beyond. Admiral Zheng He was commissioned to command the treasure fleet for the expeditions. Six of the voyages occurred during the Yongle reign (r. 1402‚Äì24), while the seventh voyage occurred under the Xuande reign (r. 1425‚Äì1435). The first three voyages reached up to Calicut on India's Malabar Coast, while the fourth voyage went as far as Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Afterwards, the fleet made voyages to the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. The Chinese expeditionary fleet was heavily militarized and carried great amounts of treasures, which served to project Chinese power and wealth to the known world. They brought back many foreign ambassadors whose kings and rulers were willing to declare themselves tributaries of China. During the course of the voyages, they destroyed Chen Zuyi's pirate fleet at Palembang, captured the Sinhalese Kotte kingdom of King Alekeshvara, and defeated the forces of the Semudera pretender Sekandar in northern Sumatra. The Chinese maritime exploits brought many foreign countries into the nation's tributary system and sphere of influence through both military and political supremacy, thus incorporating the states into the greater Chinese world order under Ming suzerainty. Moreover, the Chinese restructured and established control over an expansive maritime network in which the region became integrated and its countries became interconnected on an economic and political level. The Ming treasure voyages were commanded and overseen by the eunuch establishment whose political influence was heavily dependent on imperial favor. Within Ming China's imperial state system, the civil officials were the primary political opponents of the eunuchs and the opposing faction against the expeditions. Around the end of the maritime voyages, the civil government gained the upper hand within the state bureaucracy, while the eunuchs gradually fell out of favor after the death of the Yongle Emperor and lost the authority to conduct these large-scale endeavors. The collapse of the expeditions was further brought about by the elite-driven economic interests against the central state control of commerce, as the maritime enterprise had been key to counterbalancing much of the localized private trade, which drew the enmity of authorities that benefited from that trade. Over the course of the maritime voyages in the early 15th century, Ming China became the pre-eminent naval power by projecting its sea power further to the south and west. There is still much debate about issues such as the actual purpose of the voyages, the size of the ships, the magnitude of the fleet, the routes taken, the nautical charts employed, the countries visited, and the cargo carried.. Background Naval power The Yongle Emperor inherited a powerful navy from his predecessor, the Hongwu Emperor... He further strengthened and expanded the Ming navy as an instrument for an expansive overseas policy. The Taizong Shilu contains 24 short entries for the imperial orders for shipbuilding, with figures pointing to at least 2868 ships, from 1403 to 1419.. Over the course of 1403, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Huguang's provincial governments as well as Nanjing, Suzhou, and other cities' military garrisons were ordered to begin constructing ships.. Creation of the fleet Under the reign of the Yongle Emperor, Ming China underwent militaristic expansionism with ventures such as the treasure voyages... In 1403, the Yongle Emperor issued an imperial order to start the immense construction project of the treasure fleet.. Zheng He was ordered to initiate the construction of the fleet. The treasure fleet was known by its original designation Xiafan Guanjun (‰∏ãÁï™ÂÆòËªç; lit. \\"foreign expeditionary armada\\") in Chinese sources.. It came to comprise many trading ships, warships, and support vessels. The Longjiang shipyard was the construction site for many of the fleet's ships,.. including all of the treasure ships. It was located on the Qinhuai River near Nanjing, where the Qinhuai flows into the Yangtze River.. Many trees were cut along the Min River and upper reaches of the Yangtze to supply the necessary resources for fleet's construction. The Yongle Emperor placed great trust in Zheng He and appointed him to command the treasure fleet.. The emperor even gave him blank scrolls with the imperial seal to issue imperial orders at sea. Course First voyage Modern wax statue of Admiral Zheng He (Quanzhou Maritime Museum) In the third lunar month (30 March to 28 April) of 1405, a preliminary order was issued to Admiral Zheng He and others to command 27,000 troops to the Western Ocean.. An imperial edict, dated 11 July 1405, was issued containing the order for the expedition... It was addressed to Zheng He, Wang Jinghong, and others.. The Yongle Emperor held a banquet for the crew on the evening before the fleet's maiden voyage.. Gifts were presented to the officers and the common crew according to their rank. Sacrifices and prayers were offered to Tianfei, the patron goddess of sailors, in the hopes of ensuring a successful journey and safe passage during the voyage. In the autumn of 1405, the treasure fleet had assembled at Nanjing and was ready to depart from the city.. According to the Taizong Shilu's 11 July 1405 entry about the dispatch of the fleet, Zheng and \\"others\\" departed for the first expedition \\"bearing imperial letters to the countries of the Western Ocean and with gifts to their kings of gold brocade, patterned silks, and colored silk gauze, according to their status\\".. The treasure fleet made a stop at Liujiagang.. There, the fleet was organized in squadrons while the fleet's crew honored Tianfei with prayers and sacrifices. Afterwards, the fleet sailed down the coast towards the mouth of the Min River, where it awaited the northeast monsoon at Taiping anchorage in the Changle district. More prayers and sacrifices were conducted for Tianfei by the crew while waiting for the monsoon. Afterwards, the fleet departed via the Wuhumen (lit. \\"five tiger passage\\") in Fujian.. The treasure fleet sailed to Champa,. Java,. Malacca, Aru, Semudera, Lambri, Ceylon, Quilon, and Calicut.. From Lambri, the treasure fleet sailed straight through the Indian Ocean instead of following the Bay of Bengal coastline to Ceylon. Three days after the departure from Lambri, a ship split off and went to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. After six days, the treasure fleet saw the mountains of Ceylon and arrived at Ceylon's western coast two days later. They were met with hostility from Alagakkonara, so they left.. Dreyer (2007) states that it is possible that Zheng made port at Quilon‚Äîalthough there is no account confirming this‚Äîbecause the King of Quilon traveled with the fleet to China in 1407. Mills (1970) states that the fleet may have made a four-month stay at Calicut from December to April 1407. Around Cape Comorin at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, the treasure fleet changed direction and began its return journey to China.. During the return, the fleet stopped at Malacca again.. During the return trip in 1407, Zheng and his associates engaged Chen Zuyi and his pirate fleet in battle at Palembang. Chen Zuyi was a pirate leader who had seized Palembang and dominated the maritime route of the Malaccan Strait. The battle ended with Chen's pirate fleet being defeated.. He and his lieutenants were executed on 2 October 1407 when the fleet returned to Nanjing.. The Ming court appointed Shi Jinqing as the Pacification Superintendent of Palembang, establishing an ally at Palembang and securing access to its port.. The fleet returned to Nanjing on 2 October 1407... After accompanying the treasure fleet during the return journey, the foreign envoys (from Calicut, Quilon, Semudera, Aru, Malacca, and other unspecified nations) visited the Ming court to pay homage and present tribute with their local products. The Yongle Emperor ordered the Ministry of Rites, whose duties included the protocol concerning foreign ambassadors, to prepare gifts for the foreign kings who had sent envoys to the court. Second voyage Painting of the Yongle Emperor, Ming dynasty (National Palace Museum) The imperial order for the second voyage was issued in October 1407. The edict was addressed to Zheng, Wang, and Hou Xian (‰æØÈ°Ø). Lang Ying's Qixiuleigao (‰∏É‰øÆÈ°ûÁ®ø) records that Zheng, Wang, and Hou were dispatched in 1407.. The Taizong Shilu records that Zheng and others went as envoys to the countries of Calicut, Malacca, Semudera, Aru, Jiayile, Java, Siam, Champa, Cochin, Abobadan, Quilon, Lambri, and Ganbali. On 30 October 1407, a grand director was dispatched with a squadron to Champa before Zheng He followed with the main body of the fleet.. The fleet departed in the fifth year of the Yongle reign (late 1407 or possibly early 1408). The fleet traveled from Nanjing to Liujiagang to Changle. Then it sailed to Champa; Siam; Java; Malacca; Semudera, Aru, and Lambri on Sumatra; Jiayile, Abobadan, Ganbali, Quilon, Cochin, and Calicut in India. Dreyer (2007) states that it is possible that Siam and Java were visited by the main fleet or by detached squadrons before regrouping at Malacca. During this voyage, Zheng and his fleet did not land on Ceylon.. The fleet was tasked to carry out the formal investiture of Mana Vikraan as the king of Calicut.. A tablet was placed in Calicut to commemorate the relationship between China and India. In this voyage, the Chinese forcibly settled the enmity between Ming China and Java. In a civil war on Java between 1401 and 1406, the King of West Java killed 170 members of a Chinese embassy who had come ashore in his rival's territory at East Java. The entry dated to 23 October 1407 in the Ming Shilu states that the Western King of Java had sent an envoy to the Ming court to admit his guilt for mistakenly killing 170 Ming troops who had gone ashore to trade. It further states that the Ming court responded by demanding 60,000 liang of gold for compensation and atonement, warning that they would dispatch an army to punish the Javanese ruler for his crime if he failed to comply, and stating that the situation in Annam (referring to Ming China's successful invasion of Vietnam) can serve as an example.. The Chinese accepted the payment and apology, and restored diplomatic relations. Yan Congjian's Shuyu Zhouzilu notes that the emperor later forgave 50,000 liang of gold that was still owed from this as long as the western ruler was remorseful for his crime.. Tan (2005) remarks that Zheng had submitted the case of the killings to the emperor for a decision, rather than undertake a military invasion in revenge, as the killings were not willful. The Chinese would use the voyages to keep surveillance over Java.. During the journey, as recorded by Fei Xin, the fleet visited the Pulau Sembilan in the Strait of Malacca in the seventh year of the Yongle reign (1409). Dreyer (2007) concludes that the stop was made during the return journey of the second voyage as the treasure fleet did not leave the Chinese coast for the third voyage until early 1410. Fei Xin wrote that \\"in the seventh year of Yongle, Zheng He and his associates sent government troops onto the island to cut incense. They obtained six logs, each eight or nine chi in diameter and six or seven zhang in length, whose aroma was pure and far- ranging. The pattern [of the wood] was black, with fine lines. The people of the island opened their eyes wide and stuck out their tongues in astonishment, and were told that 'We are the soldiers of the Heavenly Court, and our awe- inspiring power is like that of the gods.'\\". The treasure fleet returned to Nanjing in the summer of 1409. The confusion of whether Zheng undertook the second voyage stems from the fact that a Chinese envoy was dispatched before he had departed with the main body of the fleet. The imperial edict for the third voyage was issued during the second voyage while the treasure fleet was still in the Indian Ocean, so Zheng was either absent when the court issued the imperial order or he had not accompanied the fleet during the second voyage. On 21 January 1409, a grand ceremony was held in the honor of the goddess Tianfei, where she received a new title. Duyvendak (1938) thinks that Zheng could not have been on the second voyage, because the ceremony's importance required Zheng's attendance. Mills (1970), citing Duyvendak (1938), also states that he did not accompany the fleet for this voyage.. However, Dreyer (2007) states that it is strongly suggested that Zheng had been on the second voyage, as Fei's account about the 1409 visit to Pulau Sembilan explicitly mentions him.. Third voyage The imperial order for the third voyage was issued in the first month of the seventh year of the Yongle reign (16 January to 14 February 1409)... It was addressed to Zheng, Wang, and Hou.. Zheng embarked on the voyage in 1409. The fleet departed from Liujiagang in the ninth month (9 October to 6 November 1409) and arrived at Changle the following month (7 November to 6 December)... They left Changle in the twelfth month (5 January to 3 February 1410) for the seas via the Wuhumen (at the entrance of the Min River in Fujian). The fleet made stops at Champa, Java, Malacca, Semudera, Ceylon, Quilon, Cochin, and Calicut.. They traveled to Champa within 10 days. Wang and Hou made short detours at Siam, Malacca, Semudera, and Ceylon. The treasure fleet landed at Galle, Ceylon, in 1410. During the homeward journey in 1411, the treasure fleet confronted King Alakeshvara (Alagakkonara) of Ceylon.. Alakeshvara posed a threat to the neighboring countries, local waters of Ceylon, and southern India.. When the Chinese arrived at Ceylon, they were overbearing and contemptuous of the Sinhalese, whom they considered rude, disrespectful, and hostile.. They also resented the Sinhalese for attacking and committing piracy towards neighboring countries who had diplomatic relations with Ming China. Zheng and 2000 troops traveled overland into Kotte because Alakeshvara had lured them into his territory. The king separated Zheng and his men from the treasure fleet anchored at Colombo and planned to attack the fleet. In response, Zheng and his troops invaded Kotte and captured its capital. The Sinhalese army (recorded to have over 50,000 troops) hastily returned and surrounded the capital, but were repeatedly defeated in battle against the invading Chinese troops. The Chinese took Alakeshvara, his family, and his principal officials captive to Nanjing, China.. Zheng returned to Nanjing on 6 July 1411.. He presented the Sinhalese captives to the Yongle Emperor, who decided to free and return them to their country. The Chinese dethroned Alakeshvara in favor of their ally Parakramabahu VI as the king with Zheng supporting him... From then on, the treasure fleet did not experience hostilities during visits to Ceylon on subsequent treasure voyages. Fourth voyage Ming China during the Yongle reign (r. 1402‚Äì24) On 18 December 1412, the Yongle Emperor issued the order for the fourth voyage... Zheng and others were commanded to lead it. The Yongle Emperor attended an archery contest for the Midsummer Festival of 1413 (5th day, 5th month, 11th year) that all the Chinese officials and foreign envoys were invited to. Duyvendak (1939) states that these envoys were so numerous that they most-likely comprised many of those whom Zheng escorted back to their countries during the fourth voyage than just close neighbors.. This expedition led the treasure fleet into Muslim countries, so it must have been important for the Chinese to seek out reliable interpreters. The interpreter Ma Huan joined the voyages for the first time. A 1523 inscription at a Muslim mosque in Xi'an records that, on the 4th month of the 11th year, Zheng was there to seek reliable interpreters and found a man named Hasan.. Zheng's fleet left Nanjing in 1413, probably in the autumn.. It set sail from Fujian in the 12th month of the 11th year in the Yongle reign (23 December 1413 to 21 January 1414). Calicut was the westernmost destination during the previous voyages, but the fleet sailed beyond it this time. The Taizong Shilu records Malacca, Java, Champa, Semudera, Aru, Cochin, Calicut, Lambri, Pahang, Kelantan, Jiayile, Ormuz, Bila, Maldives, and Sunla as stops for this voyage. The fleet sailed to Champa, Kelatan, Pahang, Malacca, Palembang,. Java, Lambri, Lide, Aru, Semudera,. Ceylon, Jiayile (opposite Ceylon), Cochin; and Calicut. They proceeded to Liushan (Maldive and Laccadive Islands), Bila (Bitra Atoll), Sunla (Chetlat Atoll), and Hormuz.. At Java, the fleet delivered gifts and favors from the Yongle Emperor. In return, a Javanese envoy arrived in China on 29 April 1415 and presented tribute in the form of \\"western horses\\" and local products while expressing gratitude. In 1415, the fleet made a stop at northern Sumatra during the journey homeward from Hormuz, where it engaged Sekandar.. Sekandar had usurped the Semudera throne from Zain al-'Abidin, but the Chinese had formally recognized the latter as the King of Semudera; Even though Sekandar was an autonomous ruler, he was not recognized by the Chinese. Fei describes Sekandar as a false king who robbed, stole, and usurped the throne of Semudera, Ma portrays him as someone who attempted to overthrow the ruler, as the Ming Shilu records that Sekandar was the younger brother of the former king and plotted to kill the ruler.. Zheng was ordered to launch a punitive attack against the usurper and restore Zain al-'Abidin as the rightful king. In retaliation, Sekandar led his forces to attack the Ming forces and was defeated. He reportedly attacked with \\"tens of thousands\\" of soldiers. The Ming forces pursued Sekandar's forces to Lambri where they captured Sekandar, his wife, and his child. King Zain al-'Abidin later dispatched a tribute mission to express his gratefulness. This conflict reaffirmed Chinese power over the foreign states and the maritime route by protecting the local political authority that sheltered the trade. Sekandar was presented to the Yongle Emperor at the palace gate and later executed. It is not known when this execution happened, but Ma states that Sekandar was publicly executed in the capital after the fleet returned. On 12 August 1415, Zheng's fleet returned to Nanjing from this voyage.. The Yongle Emperor had been absent since 16 March 1413 for his second Mongol campaign and had not returned when the fleet arrived. After the fleet's return, envoys bearing tribute from 18 countries had been sent to the Ming court. Fifth voyage On 14 November 1416, the Yongle Emperor returned to Nanjing.. On 19 November, a grand ceremony was held where the Yongle Emperor bestowed gifts to princes, civil officials, military officers, and the ambassadors of 18 countries. On 19 December, the eighteen ambassadors were received at the Ming court. On 28 December, they visited the Ming court to announce their departure and were bestowed robes before they left. That day, the Yongle Emperor ordered the undertaking of the fifth voyage,. the aim of which was to return the 18 ambassadors and to reward their kings. Zheng and others received orders to escort the ambassadors back home. They carried imperial letters and gifts for several kings. The King of Cochin received special treatment because he had sent tribute since 1411 and later also sent ambassadors to request the patent of investiture and a seal. The Yongle Emperor granted him both requests, conferred to him a long inscription (allegedly composed by the emperor himself), and gave the title \\"State Protecting Mountain\\" to a hill in Cochin. Zheng may have left the Chinese coast in the autumn of 1417.. He first made port at Quanzhou to load up the fleet's cargo holds with porcelain and other goods.. Archaeological finds of contemporary Chinese porcelain have been excavated at the East African places visited by Zheng's fleet. A Ming tablet at Quanzhou commemorates Zheng burning incense for divine protection for the voyage on 31 May 1417... The fleet visited Champa, Pahang, Java, Palembang, Malacca, Semudera, Lambri, Ceylon, Cochin, Calicut, Shaliwanni (possibly Cannanore), Liushan (Maladive and Laccadive Islands), Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and Malindi.. For Arabia and East Africa, the most- likely route was Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and then Malindi.. The Tarih al-Yaman reports that Chinese ships reached the Aden coast in January 1419 and did not leave the Rasulid capital at Ta'izz before 19 March.. On 8 August 1419, the fleet had returned to China. The Yongle Emperor was in Beijing but ordered the Ministry of Rites to give monetary rewards to the fleet's personnel. The accompanied ambassadors were received at the Ming court in the eighth lunar month (21 August to 19 September) of 1419. Their tribute included lions, leopards, dromedary camels, ostriches, zebras, rhinoceroses, antelopes, giraffes, and other exotic animals, amazing the courtiers in the Ming court. Sixth voyage The Taizong Shilu's 3 March 1421 entry notes that the envoys of sixteen countries (Hormuz and other countries) were given gifts of paper, coin money, ceremonial robes, and linings before returning to their respective countries.. The imperial order for the sixth voyage was dated 3 March 1421.. Zheng was dispatched with imperial letters, silk brocade, silk floss, silk gauze, and other gifts for the rulers of these countries. Gong Zhen's Xiyang Fanguo Zhi records a 10 November 1421 imperial edict instructing Zheng He, Kong He (Â≠îÂíå), Zhu Buhua (Êú±ÂçúËä±), and Tang Guanbao (ÂîêËßÄ‰øù) to arrange the provisions for Hong Bao and others for their dispatch to escort foreign envoys home.. The envoys of the 16 different states were escorted to their homelands by the treasure fleet. It is likely that the first few destinations were Malacca and the three Sumatran states of Lambri, Aru, and Semudera. The fleet was divided into several detached squadrons at Semudera.. All the squadrons proceeded to Ceylon, whereafter they separated for Jiayile, Cochin, Ganbali, or Calicut in southern India. The squadrons traveled from there to their respective destinations at Liushan (Maldive and Laccadive Islands), Hormuz at the Persian Gulf, the three Arabian states of Djofar, Lasa, and Aden, and the two African states of Mogadishu and Brava. The eunuch Zhou (probably Zhou Man) led a detached squadron to Aden. Ma mentions Zhou Man and Li Xing in connection to the visit of Aden.. Their squadron may have also visited Lasa and Djofar. According to the Mingshi, Zheng personally visited Ganbali as an envoy in 1421. Of the twelve visited nations west of Sumatra, this was the only one explicitly reported to have been visited by Zheng himself. Even though Quilon was not visited, the squadron for Mogadishu probably separated near Quilon as a navigation point while the main fleet continued to Calicut.. A large squadron proceeded further from Calicut to Hormuz, which may have traveled via the Laccadives. Upon return, several squadrons regrouped at Calicut and all the squadrons regrouped further at Semudera. Siam was likely visited during the return journey. The fleet returned on 3 September 1422.. They brought with them envoys from Siam, Semudera, Aden, and other countries, who bore tribute in local products. The foreign envoys, who traveled to China with the fleet, proceeded overland or via the Grand Canal before reaching the imperial court at Beijing in 1423. Nanjing garrison The Great Bao'en Temple as depicted in Fischer von Erlach's A Plan of Civil and Historical Architecture (1721) On 14 May 1421, the Yongle Emperor ordered the temporary suspension of the voyages.. At the expense of the treasure fleet's voyages, imperial attention and funding was diverted to the third, fourth, and fifth Mongol campaigns.. Between 1422 and 1431, the treasure fleet remained in Nanjing to serve in the city's garrison.. In 1424, Zheng departed on a diplomatic mission to Palembang... Meanwhile, Zhu Gaozhi inherited the throne as the Hongxi Emperor on 7 September 1424 after the death of the Yongle Emperor on 12 August 1424.. Zheng's returned from Palembang after his death.. The Hongxi Emperor did not support the treasure voyages.. and on 7 September 1424 he terminated further ones... He kept the treasure fleet as a part of Nanjing's garrison.. The fleet also retained its original designation Xiafan Guanjun. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Zheng as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the treasure fleet for the city's defense.. On 25 March 1428, the Xuande Emperor ordered Zheng and others to supervise the rebuilding and repair of the Great Bao'en Temple at Nanjing.. The temple was completed in 1431,. and it is speculated that the funds to build it were diverted from the treasure voyages.. Seventh voyage Route of the seventh voyage Gong records that an imperial order was issued on 25 May 1430 for the arrangement of necessary provisions for the dispatch of Zheng, Wang, Li Xing, Zhu Liang, Yang Zhen, Hong Bao, and others on official business to the countries of the Western Ocean. It was addressed to Yang Qing (Ê•äÊÖ∂), Luo Zhi (ÁæÖÊô∫), Tang Guanbo (ÂîêËßÄ‰øù), and Yuan Cheng (Ë¢ÅË™†). On 29 June 1430, the Xuande Emperor issued his orders for the seventh voyage to Zheng and others... The Xuanzong Shilu reports that Zheng, Wang, and others were sent to distant foreign lands to bring them into deference and submission. The emperor wished to reinvigorate the tributary relations that were promoted during the Yongle reign. Before departing for the seventh voyage, Zheng and his associates had the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions inscribed. The Xia Xiyang provides information about the dates and itinerary for this voyage. The fleet embarked from Longwan (lit. \\"dragon bay\\") in Nanjing on 19 January 1431... On 23 January, the fleet stopped at Xushan, an island in the Yangtze where the crew hunted animals. On 2 February, the fleet sailed through the Fuzi Passage (present-day Baimaosha Channel) to the Yangtze River's estuary before arriving at Liujiagang the following day (3 February). On 14 March, the Liujiagang inscription was erected there.. On 8 April, the fleet arrived and stayed at Changle from 8 April to mid-December. The Changle inscription, dated to the 11th month of the 6th year of the Xuande reign, was erected during the end of their stay. On 16 December 1431, they traveled to the Fu Tou Shan, possibly near Fuzhou. The treasure fleet sailed through the Wuhumen on 12 January 1432. On 27 January, the fleet briefly stopped at the capital city Vijaya (near present-day Qui Nhon) of Champa before departing on 12 February.. On 7 March, the fleet arrived at Surabaya, Java.. The fleet remained in the region before departing on 13 July. The fleet stayed at Palembang from 24 ‚Äì 27 July.. From Palembang, the fleet sailed down the Musi River, through the Banka Strait, and passed the Lingga and Riau archipelagos.. The archipelagos had pirates that threatened passing ships, but they posed no threat to the treasure fleet. On 3 August, the treasure fleet arrived at Malacca and left on 2 September. The fleet's next destination was Semudera, where it stayed from 12 September to 2 November. On 28 November, the fleet arrived at Beruwala on Ceylon and left on 2 December. It stopped at Calicut 10 ‚Äì 14 December 1432, beforie arriving at Hormuz on 17 January 1433.. The treasure fleet remained in Hormuz for almost two months before traveling homeward on 9 March 1433. Of the eight destinations recorded for the seventh voyage in the Xia Xiyang, Hormuz was furthest west. The Mingshi and other sources describe the voyage visiting a total of seventeen countries (including those already mentioned in the Xia Xiyang).. The additional destinations reported in the Mingshi are Coimbator (Ganbali), Bengal, Laccadive and Maldive island chains, Djofar, Lasa, Aden, Mecca, Mogadishu, and Brava. Gong recorded a total of 20 visited countries. During the voyage, as Fei mentions, the fleet stopped at the Andaman and Nicobar island chains.. He writes that, on 14 November 1432, the fleet arrived at Cuilanxu (probably the Great Nicobar Island) where it anchored for three days due to the unfavorable winds and waves.. He further writes that the native men and women came in log boats to trade coconuts. The neighboring Aru, Nagur, Lide, and Lambri were certainly visited by a few ships, according to Dreyer (2007), on the fleet's way to Semudera in northern Sumatra. Zheng is mentioned in the Mingshi in connection to the visits of Ganbali (possibly Coimatore),. Lasa, Djorfar, Magadishu, and Brava. Dreyer (2007) states that the account is unclear on whether he went to those places in person, but the wording in the Mingshi could indicate that he proclaimed imperial instructions to the kings of these countries. Dreyer also speculates that it might have not been the case, as the fleet only made short stops at Calicut (4 days outward and 9 days homeward), which would not have provided enough time to travel overland to Ganbali, unless the location did not refer to Coimatore but elsewhere in southern India.. The overland journey may have been undertaken by someone else than Zheng. The Mingshi's report of Lasa states that ambassadors from Lasa, Aden, and Brava traveled with Zheng to China,. which means the ships carrying them possibly reassembled with the main fleet in Calicut if Zheng visited those countries in person. Dreyer (2007) thinks that the detached squadrons had probably already assembled at Calicut for its homeward journey, because the main fleet did not stay there for long. Hong commanded a squadron that Ma was in for the journey to Bengal.. It is not known when they exactly detached from the treasure fleet for Bengal. They sailed directly to Bengal from Semudera.. At Bengal, they traveled to Chittagong, Sonargaon, and finally to the capital Gaur.. Afterwards, they sailed directly from Bengal to Calicut; Zheng's fleet had departed from Calicut for Hormuz by the time Hong's squadron arrived in Calicut. Hong noticed that local ships were being prepared for Mecca and he sent seven Chinese men to accompany a ship bound for Mecca;. It is likely that one of the seven men was Ma. After a year, the seven men returned with commodities and valuables that they had purchased, including giraffes, lions, and ostriches. Dreyer (2007) suggests that Hong may also have been involved with several other destinations, such as Djofar, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, and Brava.. Dreyer (2007) states that the following countries may also have been visited by a few of the ships when the fleet passed by them: Siam; the northern Sumatran states of Aru, Nagur, Lide, and Lambri (when sailing to Semudera); and Quilon and Cochin (when sailing to Calicut). Mills (1970) concludes that Zheng's associates‚Äînot Zheng himself‚Äîhad visited Siam, Aru, Nagur, Lide, Lambri, Nicobar Islands, Bengal, Quilon, Cochi, Coimbatore, Maldive Islands, Dhufar, Lasa, Aden, Mecca, Mogadishu, and Brava. Pelliot (1933) suggests that the squadrons detached from the fleet at Hormuz to travel to Aden, the East African ports and perhaps Lasa. The Xia Xiyang also provided the dates and itinerary, as described hereafter, for the return route of the seventh voyage. The fleet at Hormuz departed on 9 March 1433 and arrived at Calicut on 31 March before leaving on 9 April.. The fleet stayed at Semudera from 25 April to 1 May. On 9 May, the fleet arrived at Malacca. The fleet arrived at the Kunlun Ocean on 28 May. On 13 June, the fleet arrived at Vijaya (present-day Qiu Nhon) and left on 17 June.. The Xia Xiyang notes several geographical sightings at this point until the fleet entered Taicang on 7 July. The Xia Xiyang notes that it did not record the journey from Taicang to the capital. On 22 July 1433, they arrived in Beijing... On 27 July, the Xuande Emperor bestowed ceremonial robes and paper money to the fleet's personnel. Dreyer (2007) states that they did not stop at Ceylon or southern India, because they were sailing under favorable conditions and were running before the southwest monsoon. Ma records that the various detached ships reassembled in Malacca to wait for favorable winds before continuing their return.. Zheng returned with envoys from 11 countries, including one from Mecca.. On 14 September 1433, as recorded in the Xuanzong Shilu, the following envoys came to court to present tribute: King Zain al-Abidin of Semudera sent his younger brother Halizhi Han, King Bilima of Calicut sent his ambassador Gebumanduluya, King Keyili of Cochin sent his ambassador Jiabubilima, King Parakramabahu VI of Ceylon sent his ambassador Mennidenai, King Ali of Djofar sent his ambassador Hajji Hussein, King Al-Malik az-Zahir Yahya b. Isma'il of Aden sent his ambassador Puba, King Devaraja of Coimbatore sent his ambassador Duansilijian, King Sa'if-ud-Din of Hormuz sent the foreigner Malazu, the King of \\"Old Kayal\\" (Jiayile) sent his ambassador Abd-ur-Rahman, and the King of Mecca sent the headman (toumu) Shaxian. Aftermath Situation near the end Admiral Zheng He's empty tomb at Nanjing During the course of the voyages, Ming China had become the pre-eminent naval power of the early 15th century.. The Yongle Emperor had extended imperial control over foreign lands during the span of the voyages. However, in 1433, the voyages ceased and Ming China turned away from the seas.. The trade flourished long after the voyages had ceased. Chinese ships continued to control the east Asian maritime trade and trade with India and East Africa... However, the imperial tributary system over the foreign regions and state monopoly over the foreign trade gradually broke down as time progressed as private trade supplanted the centralized tributary trade.. Foreign commerce shifted to the domain of local authorities, which further undermined the authority of the central government. The Ming treasure voyages had been a means to establish direct links between the Ming court and foreign tribute states, which had effectively outflanked both private channels of trade and local civil officials who were sabotaging the prohibitions against overseas exchange. The nobility and military were an important part of the ruling elite during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. Over time, the political power gradually shifted to the civil officials;. as a consequence, the eunuch faction was unable to gather enough support to initiate projects opposed by the civil government. Civil officials remained wary of future attempts by the eunuchs to restart the treasure voyages. Moreover, no later emperor would seriously consider undertaking new expeditions.. The withdrawal of Ming China's treasure fleet left an enormous void in the dominance over the Indian Ocean.. Causes of cessation It is not exactly known why the voyages completely ended in 1433. Duyvendak (1939) suggests that the cessation of the expeditions was partly due to the considerable expenses,Duyvendak (1939). Cited in . but Ray (1987), Finlay (1992), and Dreyer (2007) note that the costs for undertaking the voyages had not overburdened the Ming treasury... Ray (1987) adds that the Ming treasure voyages were a profitable enterprise and rejects the notion that the voyages were terminated because they were wasteful, costly, or uneconomic.. Even though civil officials had ill feelings towards eunuchs for their overbearing nature and interference in state affairs, much of the hostility that came to characterize the relationship between the officials and eunuchs manifested long after the voyages ended, when eunuchs wielded their power to enrich themselves through extortion and persecute their critics... According to Lo (1958) and Ray (1987), the hostility between these factions can not explain the cessation of the voyages. Lo (1958) also notes that Zheng was on friendly terms with many high officials and was respected by them, while Ray (1987) mentions that eunuchs such as Zheng and Hou were held in high esteem by the court. The voyages were also favorably depicted in contemporary records. Ray (1987) states that the cessation of the Ming treasure voyages primarily happened as traders and bureaucrats, for reasons of economic self-interest and through their connections in Beijing, gradually collapsed the framework supporting both the state-controlled maritime enterprise and the strict regulation of the private commerce that was subjected to prohibitive policies.. Similarly, Lo (1958) states that rich and influential individuals used their connections in Beijing to undermine efforts to restore the trade to official channels and possibly revive the voyages, because they tried to safeguard their interests and were antagonistic to the government's monopoly of foreign trade. Impact Goals and consequences The voyages were diplomatic, militaristic, and commercial in nature.. They were conducted to establish imperial control over the maritime trade, to bring the maritime trade into the tributary system,. and to force foreign countries to comply with the tributary system.. The diplomatic aspect comprised the announcement of the Yongle Emperor's accession to the throne, the establishment of hegemony over the foreign countries, and safe passage to foreign envoys who came bearing tribute.. The Chinese did not seek territorial control, as they were primarily motivated by the political and economic control across space entailing a domination over a vast network with its ports and shipping lanes.. Finlay (2008) underscores the goal of controlling maritime commerce in which the Ming treasure voyages are regarded as an attempt to reconcile China's need for maritime commerce with the government's suppression of the private aspects, representing \\"a deployment of state power to bring into line the reality of seaborne commerce with an expansive conception of Chinese hegemony.\\" The trading centers along the maritime routes were kept open to other foreign people in a joint effort to further promote international trade.. Neither the pursuit for exclusive access nor the forceful integration of foreign countries' wealth (through exclusive exploitation by removal of natural or human resources) was a feature of the expeditions. The voyages changed the organization of a maritime network, utilizing and creating nodes and conduits in its wake, and restructured international and cross-cultural relationships and exchanges. It was especially impactful as no other polity had exerted naval dominance over all sectors of the Indian Ocean prior to the these voyages.. The Ming promoted alternative nodes as a strategy to establish control over the network. For instance, due to crucial Chinese involvement, ports such as Malacca (in Southeast Asia), Cochin (on the Malabar Coast), and Malindi (on the Swahili Coast) grew as key contenders to other important and established ports.. Through the voyages, Ming China intervened with the local affairs of foreign states and asserted itself in foreign lands. The Chinese had installed or supported friendly local regimes, captured or executed rivals of local authorities, and threatened hostile local rulers into compliance. The appearance of the Ming treasure fleet generated and intensified competition among contending polities and rivals, each seeking an alliance with the Ming.. The voyages brought about the Western Ocean's regional integration and the increase in international circulation of people, ideas, and goods. It provided a platform for cosmopolitan discourses, which took place in locations such as the ships of the Ming treasure fleet, the Ming capitals of Nanjing as well as Beijing, and the banquet receptions organized by the Ming court for foreign representatives.. Diverse groups of people from across the maritime countries congregated, interacted, and traveled together as the Ming treasure fleet sailed from and to Ming China. For the first time in its history, as Sen (2016) emphasizes, the maritime region from China to Africa was under the dominance of a single imperial power and allowed for the creation of a cosmopolitan space.. Another purpose of the Chinese expeditions was the maintenance of political-ideological control across the region.. In this regard, foreigners needed to acknowledge that China was the supraordinate power in the region, not cause disturbances towards neighboring territories, and accept the tributary system out of their own interest. Foreign rulers were compelled to acknowledge the inherent moral and cultural superiority of China, an obligation expressed by paying homage and presenting tribute before the Ming court. The Chinese had the intention to civilize the many foreign peoples by bringing them into formal submission within Ming China's greater world order.. During the course of the voyages, the Yongle Emperor reasserted the political and cultural hegemony of Ming China over all others. The cultural aspect of the voyages appears in the Liujiagang inscription, stating that \\"those among the foreigners who were resisting the transforming influence (genghua) of Chinese culture and were disrespectful, we captured alive, and brigands who indulged in violence and plunder, we . Consequently the sea-route was purified and and the natives were enabled quietly to pursue their avocations.\\". The treasure fleet was, as Mills (1970) characterizes, \\"an instrument of aggression and political dominance.\\" It brought forth the manifestation of China's power and wealth to awe foreign lands under Chinese hegemony... This was actualized by showing the Ming flag and establishing a military presence along the maritime trade routes.. Diplomatic relationships were based on a mutually beneficial maritime commerce and a visible presence of a Chinese militaristic naval force in foreign waters.. The Ming Chinese naval superiority was a crucial factor in this interaction, namely because it was inadvisable to risk punitive action from the Chinese fleet. In addition, the worthwhile and profitable nature of the Ming treasure voyages for foreign countries was a persuading factor to comply. There is a theory, considered very unlikely, suggesting that the voyages were initiated to search for the dethroned Jianwen Emperor... This search is mentioned as a reason for the voyages in the later Mingshi.. As the Yongle Emperor usurped the throne, he may have actually sought to legitimize his reign by forcing the foreign countries to recognize their tributary status within Ming China's greater world order.. To this end, according to Wang (1998), the Yongle Emperor announced his intent to find the deposed Jianwen Emperor may have served no more than a public justification for the voyages in face of the prohibitive policies for military actions overseas from the Hongwu reign. Another theory, also considered very unlikely, explains that the voyages were a response to another power across Asia: the Timurid state of Tamerlane, an enemy of Ming China. However, Ming China was left unchallenged by the Timurid after Tamerlane's death in 1405, because the new Timurid ruler Shahrukh (r. 1405‚Äì1447) normalized diplomatic relations with China and was preoccupied with holding his state together. There is no evidence for both theories in contemporary historical sources, so they lack the support and conformation to be accepted. Policy and administration Painting of the Xuande Emperor, Ming dynasty (National Palace Museum) Zheng He served as the Grand Director in the Directorate of Palace Servants, a eunuch-dominated department, before his appointment to command the expeditions.. Construction projects were usually the domain of eunuchs, who were often assigned to supervise them. The treasure fleet's construction was not different in that eunuchs were assigned to supervise it, while the military was assigned to carry it out. Civil officials criticized the state expenses brought by the fleet's construction, but the emperor was set to continue his grand plans. In the Ming court, the civil officials were the faction who opposed the voyages. In contrast, the eunuch establishment stood at the head of the fleet and the expeditions.. The civil officials condemned the expeditions as extravagant and wasteful, but the Yongle Emperor was unconcerned about the costs of the voyages and was determined to complete them.. Traditionally, the civil officials were not only political opponents to the eunuch faction, but also to the military who crewed the fleet. This political and institutional disadvantage within the state system contributed to the inherent opposition of civil officials against the voyages... On cultural grounds, the civil officials were hostile to the voyages, because the trade and acquisition of strange foreign goods conflicted with their Confucian ideologies.... The undertaking of these expeditions only remained possible as long as the eunuchs maintained imperial favor.. The Hongwu Emperor was wary of the political and social consequences that maritime commerce could bring,.. so he sought to restrain it by outlawing private maritime trade.. This policy continued well into the Yongle Emperor's reign.. In addition, the Yongle Emperor aimed at consolidating imperial control over maritime commerce, stopping the coastal criminality and disorder, providing employment for mariners and entrepreneurs, exporting Chinese products to foreign markets, importing desired goods for Chinese consumers, extending the tributary system, and displaying imperial majesty to the seas.. The voyages functioned as trade commissions in the government's attempts to regulate maritime commerce by establishing an imperial monopoly over it and incorporating it into the tributary system.. There was supposedly an idea about a foreign policy comprising an extended foreign trade supported by a heavy military naval presence and a cultivation of shared interests with local allies. The emperor's interest in the voyages was the highest during the period spanning the first three voyages, but he became more occupied with his offensive military campaigns against the Mongols after establishing the capital at Beijing.. By the fourth voyage, the emperor showed interest in the expansion of trade and diplomatic activity to West Asia.. Therefore, the Chinese sought and employed Persian and Arabic interpreters, such as Ma Huan and Guo Chongli, to accompany the fleet. After the capital was transferred from Nanjing to Beijing, the south and the seas were given less and less attention from emperors and officials alike.. The Hongxi Emperor wished to revert his predecessor's relocation of the capital, but he died on 29 May 1425 before he could do so;. he was succeeded by the Xuande Emperor who remained in Beijing.. In contrast to the Hongxi Emperor who relied on civil officials during his reign, the Xuande Emperor relied on eunuchs.. Dreyer (2007) states that the prospects for the voyages would have been better if the capital was relocated back to Nanjing, because the court would have been near the Longjiang shipyards where most of the ships were built and where the voyages started. Minister of Finance Xia Yuanji (Â§èÂéüÂêâ) was a vocal opponent to the treasure voyages... The Hongxi Emperor was also fiercely against the treasure voyages throughout his reign. After taking Xia's advice, the emperor ordered the cessation of the treasure voyages on 7 September 1424, the day of his accession to the throne.. When the Xuande Emperor ordered the seventh voyage, he went against the general court opinion.. After 1433, the civil officials succeeded in halting subsequent maritime expeditions. The ships were left to rot and their lumber was sold for fuel in Nanjing. The mariners were reassigned to load grain on barges of the Grand Canal and to build the emperor's mausoleum. After the voyages, subsequent Ming emperors would reject the Yongle Emperor's policy of bringing the maritime trade into the structure of the tributary system. Personnel and organization treasure ship (Hong Kong Science Museum) The Chinese fleet comprised an array of ships, each of which fulfilled specialized functions... Each treasure ship was crewed by about 500 men according to Mills (1970) or at least 600 men according to Finlay (1992).. The high-ranking officers‚ÄîAdmiral Zheng He and his associates‚Äîwere from the eunuch faction.. The crew was predominantly from the Ming military and was primarily recruited from Fujian.. There were seven Grand Directors (taijian) who served as the ambassadors and commanders of the fleet, and were followed by 10 Junior Directors (shaojian): they were all eunuchs. Zheng was one of the Grand Directors. In total, there were 70 eunuchs in command of the treasure fleet. They oversaw 2 brigadiers (du zhihuishi), 93 captains (zhihuishi), 104 lieutenants (qianhu), and 103 sub-lieutenants (bohu)... There were also 180 medical personnel, a Ministry of Finance bureau director, two secretaries, two Court of State Ceremonial protocol officers, an astrological officer, and four astrologers.. The personnel also had guard judges (wei zhenfu) and battalion judges (suo zhenfu). The remaining personnel included petty officers (qixiao or quanxiao), brave corps (yongshi), power corps (lishi), military soldiers (referred as guanjun, \\"official soldiers\\", or qijun, \\"flag soldiers\\"), supernumeraries (yuding), boatsman (minshao), buyers (maiban), and clerks (shushou).. Zhu Yunming's Xia Xiyang records the following personnel: officers and petty officers (guanxiao), soldiers (qijun), mess leaders (huozhang), helmsman (tuogong), anchormen (bandingshou), interpreters (tongshi), business managers (banshi), accountants (susuanshi), doctors (yishi), anchor mechanics (tiemiao), caulkers (munian), sailmakers (dacai), sailors (shuishou), and boatmen (minshaoren). The Liujiagang inscriptions record Zheng He (ÈÑ≠Âíå) and Wang Jinghong (ÁéãÊôØÂºò) as the principal envoys. It also records Zhu Liang (Êú±ËâØ), Zhou Man (Âë®Êªø), Hong Bao (Ê¥™‰øù), Yang Zhen (Ê•äÁúü), and Zhang Da (ÂºµÈÅî) as deputy envoys. The Changle inscription repeats this, but adds Li Xing (ÊùéËàà) and Wu Zhong (Âê≥Âø†) as deputy envoys. All envoys are recorded to have carried the rank of Grand Director in both inscriptions, except Zhang Da who was reported with the rank of Senior Assistant Director in the Liujiagang inscription and the rank of Grand Director in the Changle inscription. Additionally, the Changle inscription mentions Zhu Zhen (Êú±Áúü) and Wang Heng (ÁéãË°°) as the brigadiers. These people and unnamed \\"others\\" are mentioned on the respective inscriptions as those who have composed it. The Changle inscription also mentions that the Daoist priest Yang Yichu (Ê•ä‰∏ÄÂàù) begged to erect the respective stele. For the first voyage, the fleet had a personnel of 27,800 or 27,870 men. and 317 ships. The Mingshi states that there was a crew of 27,800 men and that 62 of the ships were treasure ships, though Dreyer (2007) suggests the possibility of an extra treasure ship. Tan Qian's (Ë´áÈÅ∑) Guoque (ÂúãÁ¢∫) records 63 treasure ships and a crew of 27,870 for the first voyage. The Zuiweilu records a personnel of 37,000, but this is probably an error.. Yan Congjian's (Âö¥ÂæûÁ∞°) Shuyu Zhouzilu records an imperial order for the construction of 250 ships specifically for the voyages to the Western Ocean: it is actually two separate imperial orders‚Äîas recorded in the Taizong Shilu‚Äîboth of which were issued to the Nanjing's capital guards for 200 ships (Êµ∑ÈÅãËàπ haiyunchuan; lit. \\"seagoing transport ships\\") on 4 September 1403 and for 50 ships (Êµ∑Ëàπ haichuan; lit. \\"seagoing ships\\") on 1 March 1404.. However, the Taizong Shilu did not record the purpose of these 250 ships.. It also records an imperial order issued on 2 March 1404 for Fujian to construct five ships (haichuan) to be used in the voyages to the Western Ocean. These 255 ships plus the 62 treasure ships add up to 317 ships. For the second voyage, it is thought that the treasure fleet comprised 249 ships. On 5 October 1407, as the Taizong Shilu records, Wang Hao was ordered to supervise the conversion of 249 ships in preparation for embassies to the countries at the Western Ocean.. This was close to the date when the second voyage was ordered, thus the fleet likely comprised these 249 ships for the second voyage. The number of treasure ships or personnel. is not known. For the third voyage, Fei Xin's Xingcha Shenglan records that the fleet had 48 haibo (Êµ∑Ëà∂; lit. \\"ocean traders\\") and a crew of over 27,000.. Dreyer (2007) states that Fei was probably referring to the treasure ships as haibo.. Yan's Shuyu Zhouzilu and Lu Rong's Shuyuan Zaji use the term \\"treasure ship\\" instead when they mention the 48 ships for this voyage. Coincidently, the Taizong Shilu records the imperial order issued on 14 February 1408 for the construction of 48 treasure ships to the Ministry of Works at Nanjing; these were possibly the 48 treasure ships for the third voyage. Dreyer (2007) states that the treasure fleet likely had an undisclosed array of support ships besides the 48 treasure ships. Ma's Yingya Shenglan records 63 treasure ships for the fourth voyage,. which were probably accompanied by support ships. The fleet was crewed by 28,560 or 27,670 men.. Fei records a personnel of 27,670 for this voyage, but another source records 28,560. There is no record for the number of ships or personnel for the fifth voyage. On 2 October 1419, an order was issued for the construction of 41 treasure ships from an undisclosed shipbuilder.. It is possible that Zheng used these ships for the sixth voyage.. Most scholars conclude that these were likely used for the sixth voyage, but many other treasure ships had already been constructed or were in construction by that time.. There is no specific figure for the ships or personnel of the sixth voyage. The treasure fleet probably made use of several dozen of the treasure ships each accompanied by half a dozen support vessels. For the seventh voyage, the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions speak of over a hundred large ships (Â∑®Ëà∂ jubo; lit. \\"giant ships\\"). Dreyer (2007) suggests that this probably included most of the remaining treasure ships, which were likely accompanied by support ships. In the Xia Xiyang, Zhu Yunming gives the names of several ships‚ÄîQinghe (Ê∏ÖÂíå; \\"pure harmony\\"), Huikang (ÊÉ†Â∫∑; \\"kind repose\\"), Changning (Èï∑ÂØß; \\"lasting tranquility\\"), Anji (ÂÆâÊøü; \\"peaceful crossing\\"), and Qingyuan (Ê∏ÖÈÅ†; \\"pure distance\\")‚Äîand notes that there were also ships designated by a series number. The fleet had 27,550 men as personnel for the voyage. Military affairs Before the voyages, there was turmoil around the seas near the Chinese coast and distant Southeast Asian maritime regions, characterized by piracy, banditry, slave trade, or other illicit activities.. The treasure fleet had a large number of warships to protect their precious cargo and to secure the maritime routes. They established a substantial Chinese military presence around the South China Sea and trading cities in southern India. The early stages of the voyages were especially characterized by highly militaristic objectives, as the Chinese stabilized the sea passages from hostile entities as well as strengthened their own position and maintained their status in the region.. Even though Zheng sailed through the oceans with a military force larger and stronger than any local power, there is no written evidence in historical sources that there was any attempt that they forcibly tried to control the maritime trade in the regions of the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. Dreyer (2007) adds that foreign nations must have seen a \\"terrifying apparition\\" when the large Chinese fleet came within visible reach before their coastlines, bringing any state into submission by the sole sight of it alone.. From the fourth voyage onwards, the treasure fleet ventured further than their usual end-destination of Calicut to lands beyond where there would be less direct hostilities.. The fleet engaged and defeated Chen Zuyi's pirate fleet in Palembang, Alakeshvara's forces in Ceylon, and Sekandar's forces in Semudera, bringing security and stability of the maritime routes via Chinese control.. These actors were viewed as hostile threats in their regions and the battles served as a reminder of the tremendous power of Ming China to the countries along the maritime routes. On the Malabar coast, Calicut and Cochin were in an intense rivalry, so the Ming decided to intervene by granting special status to Cochin and its ruler Keyili (ÂèØ‰∫¶Èáå).. For the fifth voyage, Zheng He was instructed to confer a seal upon Keyili of Cochin and enfeoff a mountain in his kingdom as the Zhenguo Zhi Shan (ÈéÆÂúã‰πãÂ±±, Mountain Which Protects the Country). He delivered a stone tablet, inscribed with a proclamation composed by the Yongle Emperor, to Cochin. As long as Cochin remained under the protection of Ming China, the Zamorin of Calicut could not invade Cochin and a military conflict was averted. When the Ming treasure voyages ceased Cochin was eventually invaded by Calicut. In Malacca, the Chinese actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for the voyages into the Indian Ocean. Malacca had been a relatively insignificant region, not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both Ma and Fei, and was a vassal region of Siam.. In 1405, the Ming court dispatched Zheng He with a stone tablet enfeoffing the Western Mountain of Malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country. The Chinese also established a government depot (ÂÆòÂª†) as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers. It served as a storage facility as the fleet traveled and assembled from other destinations within the maritime region. Ma Huan reports that Siam did not dare to invade Malacca thereafter. The rulers of Malacca, such as King Paramesvara in 1411, would pay tribute to the Chinese emperor in person. In 1431, when a Malaccan representative complained that Siam was obstructing tribute missions to the Ming court, the Xuande Emperor dispatched Zheng He carrying a threatening message for the Siamese king saying \\"You, king should respect my orders, develop good relations with your neighbours, examine and instruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or aggressively.\\" Diplomacy and commerce Porcelain wares, similar to these Yongle-era porcelain flasks, were often presented as trade goods during the expeditions (British Museum) The treasure ships had an enormous cargo comprising various products.. The commodities that the fleet's ships carried included three major categories: gifts to be offered to rulers, money for exchange of goods or payment of goods with fixed prices at low rates (e.g. gold, silver, copper coins, and paper money), and luxury items that China monopolized (e.g. musks, ceramics, and silks). It was said that there were sometimes so many Chinese goods unloaded into an Indian port that it could take months to price everything.. In turn, Zheng returned to China with many kinds of tribute goods, such as silver, spices, sandalwood, precious stones, ivory, ebony, camphor, tin, deer hides, coral, kingfisher feathers, tortoise shells, gums and resin, rhinoceros horn, sapanwood and safflower (for dyes and drugs), Indian cotton cloth, and ambergris (for perfume). The ships even brought back exotic animals, such as ostriches, elephants, and giraffes. The imports from the voyages provided large quantities of economic goods that fueled China's own industries.. For example, there was so much cobalt oxide from Persia that the porcelain industry at Jingdezhen had a plentiful supply for decades after the voyages. The fleet also returned with a large amount of black pepper that the once- costly luxury became a common commodity in Chinese society.. The treasure voyages resulted in a flourishing Ming economy and significantly boosted the lucrative maritime commerce.T'ien (1981). Cited in ... The expeditions developed into a maritime trade enterprise where the Chinese began trading and supplying the commodities that were non-Chinese in origin.. This highlighted the commercial character of the voyages in which the Chinese expanded upon the already large profits from their trade. The impact of the expeditions on commerce was on multiple levels: it established imperial control over local private commercial networks, expanded tributary relations and thereby brought commerce under state supervision, established court-supervised transactions at foreign ports and thereby generate substantial revenue for both parties, and increased production and circulation of commodities across the region.. The voyages induced a sudden supply shock in the Eurasian market, where the Chinese maritime exploits in Asia led to disruptions of European imports with sudden price spikes in the early 15th century.. Imperial proclamations were issued to foreign kings, meaning that they could either submit and be bestowed with rewards or refuse and be pacified under the threat of an overwhelming military force... Foreign kings had to reaffirm their recognition of the Chinese emperor's superior status by presenting tribute.. Those rulers who submitted received political protection and material rewards... Many countries were enrolled as tributaries.. The treasure fleet conducted the transport of the many foreign envoys to China and back, but some envoys traveled independently.. Geography and society Cakra Donya bell, a gift from Zheng He to Semudera (Aceh Museum) During the onset of their voyages, the treasure fleet would embark from the Longjiang shipyard, north-west of Nanjing.. They would then sail down the Yangtze River to Liujiagang. Once there, Zheng would organize his fleet and make sacrifices to the goddess Tianfei. Over the course of the following four to eight weeks, the fleet would gradually proceed to Taiping anchorage in Changle, Fujian, and wait there for the favorable northeast winter monsoon before leaving the Fujian coast... They would reach the sea through the Wuhumen and mostly sailed through established trade routes to other regions.. The port of Qui Nhon in Champa was always the first foreign destination that the fleet visited. During the first three voyages from 1405 to 1411, the fleet followed the same basic maritime route: from Fujian to the first call in Champa, across the South China Sea to Java and Sumatra, up the Strait of Malacca to northern Sumatra for assembly of the fleet, across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, then along the Malabar Coast to Calicut.. At the time, the fleet sailed no further than Calicut. During the fourth voyage, the route was extended to Hormuz.. During the fifth, sixth, and seventh voyages, the fleet traveled further to destinations in the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. For the sixth voyage, the treasure fleet sailed up to Calicut, where several detached squadrons proceeded to further destinations at the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. For the seventh voyage, the treasure fleet followed the route up to Hormuz, while detached squadrons traveled to the other far-lying destinations at the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. The treasure fleet sailed the equatorial and subtropical waters of the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, where they were dependent on the circumstances of the annual cycle of monsoon winds.. Therefore, the fleet's navigators precisely organized the voyages under careful considerations of the periodical patterns of the tropical and subtropical monsoon.. For the southward route from Changle in China to Surabaya in Java, the fleet followed the northeast wind, crossed the Equator (where the northeast wind changes into the northwest wind due to the Coriolis force), and then followed the northwest wind.. At Java, the fleet waited for the arrival of the tropical southeast wind in the Southern Hemisphere and used it to sail towards Sumatra. At Sumatra, the fleet was halted due to the change of the southeast wind into a strong southwest wind at a northern latitude close to the equator and waited until next winter for the northeast wind. For the northwestward route towards Calicut and Hormuz, the Chinese took advantage of the northeastern wind. The return journey was set during the late summer and early autumn because favorable monsoon winds were present at that time.. The fleet left Hormuz before the southwestern monsoon arrived over the Indian Ocean. They made use of the northern wind for the southward journey from Hormuz to Calicut. For the eastward journey from Sumatra, the fleet used the newly-arrived southwestern monsoon over the eastern parts of the Indian Ocean. After the fleet passed through the Strait of Malacca, the fleet caught up with the southwest wind over the South China Sea to sail back to China. As maritime conditions were limited by the monsoon winds, squadrons were detached from the main fleet to diverge to specific destinations. The first point of divergence was Sumatra from where a squadron would travel to Bengal. The second point of divergence was Calicut, from where ships sailed to Hormuz as well as other destinations at the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. Malacca was the rendezvous point where the squadrons would reassemble for the final leg of the return journey. During all the voyages, the fleet departed from Sumatra to sail westward across the Indian Ocean.. Northern Sumatra was an important region for the fleet's anchorage and assembly before they proceeded through the Indian Ocean to Ceylon and southern India. Its location was more important to the fleet than its wealth or products. Ma wrote that Semudera was the main route to the Western Ocean and characterized it as the most important port of assembly for the Western Ocean.. The journey from Sumatra to Ceylon took about two to four weeks without seeing land. The first part of Ceylon that became visible after departure from Sumatra was Namanakuli (or Parrot's Beak Mountain), the easternmost mountain (6680 ft in elevation and 45 miles away from the coast). Two or three days after its sighting, the treasure fleet adjusted their course to sail south of Dondra Head at Ceylon. After a considerable long time at sea since leaving Sumatra, the fleet arrived at a port in Ceylon, usually at Beruwala and sometimes at Galle.. Even though it stopped at both locations, it preferred Beruwala over Galle.. Ma characterized Beruwala as \\"the wharf of the country of Ceylon.\\" Ming China had cordial relations with Calicut, which was valuable as they tried to extend the tributary system to the states around the Indian Ocean. Ma described Calicut as the \\"great country of the Western Ocean\\" and had a positive response to the Calicut authorities' regulation of trade and attention to weights and measurements. Fei described Calicut as the \\"great harbor\\" of the Western Ocean countries. Navigation Section of the Mao Kun map During the voyages, the fleet acquired and collected a large amount of navigational data: these were specifically recorded by the astrological officer and his four astrologers.. The navigational data were processed into different types of charts by a cartographic office,which included an astrological officer, four astrologers, and their clerks.. It provided the expeditionary commanders with the necessary navigational charts for their voyages. Many copies of the expeditionary charts were housed in the Ministry of War. Additional navigational data were probably also supplied by local maritime pilots, Arab records, Indian records, and earlier Chinese records. The Mao Kun map is associated with the voyages' routes.. The map is collected in the Wubei Zhi, compiled by Mao Yuanyi. It depicts various geographic locations, from Nanjing to Hormuz as well as the East African coast, with routes illustrated by dotted lines. The directions are expressed by compass points and distances, with references to navigational techniques (such as depth sounding to avoid shallow waters) and astronomy (particularly along the north‚Äìsouth route of Africa where the latitude is determined by the height of constellations relative to the horizon). The distances are expressed by time according to a watch system (two hour periods).. The Mao Kun map is appended by four stellar diagrams that are used to determine the position of the ship in relation to the stars and constellations on specific sections of the maritime route. Faith and ceremony Tribute Giraffe with Attendant, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys to the Ming court (Philadelphia Museum of Art) The faith of the treasure fleet's crew centered around Tianfei, the \\"Heavenly Princess\\" who was the goddess of sailors and seafarers.. The Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that Zheng's life was mostly defined by the treasure voyages and that his devotion to Tianfei was the dominant faith that he adhered to. The two inscriptions honored and commemorated the goddess Tianfei.. Zheng and his associates established these inscriptions at the temples of Tianfei at Liujiagang on 14 March 1431 and Changle between 5 December 1431 and 3 January 1432.. These inscriptions make reference to the crew witnessing St. Elmo's fire during dangerous storms and interpreting it as a sign of divine protection by Tianfei.. The Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions are considered the epitaphs of the Ming treasure voyages.. In Galle, Ceylon, Zheng set up a trilingual inscription dated 15 February 1409.. The inscription is in three languages, in which the Chinese section praised the Buddha, the Tamil section praised the local god Tenavarai Nayanar (an incarnation of Vishnu), and the Persian section praised Allah. Each section contains a similar list of offerings, such as 1000 pieces of gold, 5000 pieces of silver, 100 rolls of silk, 2500 catties of perfumed oil, and a variety of bronze ornaments.. As shown by this inscription, the Chinese paid their respect to the three dominant religions in Ceylon. On 20 September 1414, Bengali envoys presented a giraffe as tribute in the name of King Saif Al-Din Hamzah Shah of Bengal (r. 1410‚Äì1412) to the Yongle Emperor of Ming China.. The giraffe was presented as the qilin, but the Yongle Emperor dismissed this association and did not want his officials to send laudatory memorials on behalf of its auspicious appearance during his reign.. Records and literature There are several extant contemporary accounts, including Ma Huan's Yingya Shenglan [ÁÄõÊ∂ØÂãùË¶Ω], Fei Xin's Xingcha Shenglan [ÊòüÊßéÂãùË¶Ω], and Gong Zhen's Xiyang Fanguo Zhi [Ë•øÊ¥ãÁï™ÂúãÂøó]... Ma served as an interpreter on the fourth, sixth, and seventh voyage;. Guo Chongli was Ma's collaborator on the Yingya Shenglan and participated in three of the expeditions;. Fei served as a soldier on the third, fifth, and seventh expedition;. and Gong served as Zheng's private secretary on the seventh voyage.. These three sources provide observations to the political, economic, social, cultural, and religious conditions of the lands visited throughout the voyages. In addition, the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions are considered to be valuable records by Zheng and his associates.. Pages from a copy of Ma Huan's Yingya Shenglan The Ming Shilu provides a lot of the information relating to the treasure voyages, particularly the exchange of ambassadors. The work is divided into individual sections about the reigns of Ming emperors. Zheng lived through the reigns of five Ming emperors, but he directly served three emperors.. He is mentioned in the Taizong Shilu of the Yongle reign, the Renzong Shilu of the Hongxi reign, and the Xuanzong Shilu of the Xuande reign.. The Taizong Shilu combined the second and third voyages into one expedition,. which misconstrued Zheng's Palembang journey from 1424 to 1425 as the sixth voyage instead of his seventh.. However, the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions make a clear distinction between the second and third voyage as they correctly date the second voyage from 1407 to 1409 and the third voyage from 1409 to 1411... The Taizong Shilu was followed by the History of Ming.. A number of later works have been preserved. The accounts in the History of Ming (1739) and Huang Xingzeng's Xiyang Chaogong Dianlu [Ë•øÊ¥ãÊúùË≤¢ÂÖ∏ÈåÑ] (1520) rely on the Yingya Shenglan.. Zheng Xiao's Wuxuebian [ÂêæÂ≠∏Á∑®] (ca. 1522) relies on Zhang Sheng's rifacimento of the Yingya Shenglan. Zhu Yunming's Qianwen Ji (\\"A Record of Things Once Heard\\") (ca. 1526) contains his Xia Xiyang (‰∏ãË•øÊ¥ã; lit. \\"Down the Western Ocean\\"), which provides a detailed itinerary of the seventh voyage... There are also Lu Rong's Shuyuan Zaji (ËèΩÂúíÈõúË®ò; lit. \\"Bean Garden Miscellany\\") (1475), Yan Gongjian's Shuyu Zhouzilu (ÊÆäÂüüÂë®Âí®ÈåÑ; \\"Record of Despatches Concerning the Different Countries\\") (1520), and Gu Qiyuan's Kezuo Zhuiyu (ÂÆ¢Â∫ßË¥ÖË™û; \\"Boring Talks for My Guests\\") (ca. 1628).. Mao Yuanyi's Wubei Zhi (Ê≠¶ÂÇôÂøó) (1628) preserves the Mao Kun map [ËåÖÂù§Âúñ], which is largely based on material from the treasure voyages. Luo Maodeng's Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi (‰∏âÂØ∂Â§™Áõ£‰∏ãË•øÊ¥ãË®òÈÄö‰øóÊºîÁæ©) (1597) is a novel about the exploits of Admiral Zheng He and his fleet.. In the preface, Luo states that Chinese maritime power was essential to maintain world order.. In Luo's work, Zheng sailed the oceans to search for a sacred imperial seal that would restore harmony in the Middle Kingdom. He never finds this seal in the story, suggesting that the world order cannot be restored by any other means than military force according to Finlay (1992).. Luo's novel contains a description of different classes of ships with their sizes: the 36 nine-masted treasure ships (baochuan) were 44.4 by 18 zhang, the 700 eight-masted horse ships (machuan) were 37 by 15 zhang, the 240 seven-masted grain ships or supply ships (liangchuan) were 28 by 12 zhang, the 300 six-masted billet ships or troop transports (zuochuan) were 24 by 9.4 zhang, and the 180 five-masted combat ships or warships proper (zhanchuan) were 18 by 6.8 zhang.. Dreyer (2007) argues that this work holds little to no evidential value as a historical source, but also notes that Duyvendak thinks that it may be based on some truth.. The Kezuo Zhuiyu and the Shuyu Zhouzilu describe the following circumstances of what happened to the official archives about the expeditions.. The Chenghua Emperor issued an order to retrieve the documents concerning the expeditions to the Western Ocean from the Ministry of War archives, but the official Liu Daxia (ÂäâÂ§ßÂ§è) had hidden and burned the documents.. Liu dismissed the accounts as \\"deceitful exaggerations of bizarre things far removed from the testimony of people's ears and eyes.\\". The Shuyu Zhouzilu adds the following to the story: The Minister of War Xiang Zhong (È†ÖÂø†; in office 1474‚Äì1477) sent a clerk to retrieve the documents, but the clerk could not find them after several days of searching. Liu eventually confessed and justified his actions to Xiang by stating that \\"the expeditions of Sanbao to the Western Ocean wasted tens of myriads of money and grain, and moreover the people who met their deaths [on these expeditions] may be counted by the myriads. Although he returned with wonderful things, what benefit was it to the state? This was merely an action of bad government of which ministers should severely disapprove. Even if the old archives were still preserved they should be destroyed in order to suppress [a repetition of these things] at the root.\\" Xiang Zhong was recorded to have been impressed by this explanation. The Mingshi, the Xuanzong Shilu, and the Mingshi Jishi Benmo (ÊòéÂè≤Á¥Ä‰∫ãÊú¨Êú´) attribute the reason for the suppression and destruction of the archived records to prevent eunuch Wang Zhi (Ê±™Áõ¥) from consulting it for his invasion of Vietnam.Mingshi (Cited in ); Mingshi, Xuanzong Shilu, and Mingshi Jishi Benmo (Cited in ). Dreyer (2007) notes that Liu could not have had access to the records and doubts his alleged involvement. Duyvendak (1939) states that the Ministry of War officials were not influential enough to stop the retrieval of the documents and speculates that Liu may have destroyed them with the Minister of War's approval.. Southeast Asian sources also provide clues about the Ming treasure voyages, but Suryadinata (2005) remarks that their reliability should be scrutinized as these local histories can be intertwined with legends but still remain relevant in the collective memories of the people concerned.. For instance, he highlights the difficulties of doing research in the role of the Chinese voyages in the Islamization of Java and Malacca, as these activities are not mentioned in the Chinese chronicles and local accounts may contain more legend than history.; . Legacy In 1499, shortly before Vasco da Gama's return from India to Portugal, Girolamo Sernigi reported on the Portuguese accounts from da Gama's expedition that \\"certain vessels of white Christians\\" had made port at Calicut on the Malabar coast generations before their arrival.. He speculated that these unknown mariners could have been the Germans or the Russians, but concluded that they may learn who those people are when da Gama arrives.. After his arrival at Calicut, da Gama began hearing tales of pale bearded men who sailed with their giant ships along the local coastal waters of Calicut generations before:. the Portuguese had encountered Malabar traditions that preserved the memory of Zheng's voyages,. but they were not aware that these tales were about his fleets. They would eventually discover that these unknown mariners were, in fact, the Chinese. Da Gama's men were apparently even mistaken for the Chinese at first on arrival at the East African coast, because the Chinese were the last pale-skinned strangers arriving in large wooden ships in the memories of the East African people. In the late 16th century, Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza wrote that \\"it is plainly seene, that [the Chinese] did come with shipping into the Indies, having conquered al that is from China, unto the farthest part thereof. . . . So that at this day there is great memory of them . . . in the kingdom of Calicut, where be so many trees and fruits . . . were brought thither by the Chinos when that they were lords and governours of that countrie.\\"Mendoza, Juan Gonz√°lez de (16th century). Translation by Parke, Robert (1588) in Cited in . In November 1997 during a Harvard University speech, President Jiang Zemin praised Zheng for spreading Chinese culture abroad. Many present-day Chinese people perceive that these expeditions were conducted in accordance with Confucian ideals.. Since 2005, in commemoration of the Ming treasure voyages, China has annually celebrated its National Maritime Day on 11 July.. That year also marked the 600th anniversary of Zheng's maiden voyage.. Although the present-day popular narrative may emphasize the peaceful nature of the voyages, especially in terms of the absence of territorial conquest and colonial subjugation, it overlooks the heavy militarization of the Ming treasure fleet to exercise power projection and thereby promote its interests.. In present-day Chinese political discourse, with rising developments in China's maritime capabilities and ambitions, the Ming treasure voyages are evoked to underscore a peaceful emergence of modern China.. It is suggested that, by drawing parallels between contemporary China and the historical narrative as provided by these voyages, this political process provides several functions for China: it stimulates national pride, shapes national identity, reaffirms a maritime identity, legitimizes the development of maritime power, provides an image of a harmonious and peaceful development, highlights interconnectedness with the broader world, and provides contrast to the violent nature of western colonialism.. As such, the Ming treasure voyages play an important narrative role in China's desire to change its strategic paradigm to that of a maritime power.

It was produced and broadcast on Venevisi√≥n for about a year and a half, spanning 1967‚Äì1968. The original story, written by Delia Fiallo, has inspired several variations and adaptations through the years, most of them by Fiallo, both for television and cinema. In 1972, Venevisi√≥n aired its own remake. Summary This story is strongly based in the Cinderella mold. Yet, there are major aspects on the adaptation that make this Spanish soap opera one of the best in the history of telenovelas. Baura makes a great performance of Lucecita, a na√Øve girl that leaves her impoverished, rural home to work as a maid for a wealthy and feuding family, who own a cattle-ranching land. At this point, the man of the house is Gustavo (played by Bardina), who is married to Angelina, She is a woman pretending to be paralyzed, in order to manipulate the feelings of her husband and prevent him from leaving. But while working there, Lucecita falls in love with Gustavo. Then Angelina discovers the romance between Lucecita and Gustavo; she is full of hatred and jealousy, but after learning that Lucecita is her half- sister, her hatred towards her is even harder. But really, here is where real problems begin to arise. Solid performances by Magaz as Modesta, Lucecita's loyal best friend, and Attas for her role of Angelina. Both reprised their respective roles in tn the 1972 version.

The independent Spanish-Colombian co-production is directed by Llu√≠s Qu√≠lez based on a screenplay by Alex Pastor, David Pastor, and Javier Gull√≥n. Filming took place in Colombia between April 2013 and July 2013, after which it entered post- production. The film premiered at Germany's Fantasy Filmfest on , 2014. Plot In 1992, Dr Contreras Sr. prepares to abandon a finca in Santa Clara, Colombia. He attempts to burn a number of files, stashing them in the dumbwaiter when he hears noises around the house. On the second floor, he is chased by what appears to be a group of children, falling to his death when he is pushed from the balcony. Twenty years later, Sarah and Paul move from the UK to Santa Clara with their daughter, Hannah. Sarah is to be the new manager at a paper mill that her father Jordan owns. They move into the finca, which is owned by the company. The small family adore the finca, though Hannah is frightened by the open dumbwaiter in the wall of her room. Shortly after their arrival, Sarah and Paul attend a dinner on the opening night of the Los Ni√±os Santos festival, leaving Hannah in the care of her nanny, Catalina. Strange occurrences begin to occur around the finca, and a sleeping Hannah is woken by the door of the dumbwaiter snapping open. Seeing her favorite stuffed toy, Hannah climbs into the dumbwaiter to retrieve it, becoming trapped. Arriving home, Sarah and Paul discover Hannah, ill and developing a rash. Catalina uncomfortably mentions that she believes there was a ghost in the house and is fired by Paul. Over the following day, Hannah ails, her rash worsening, and the couple agree to take Hannah back to the UK for proper medical care. That night, as a storm brews, children who wear stained and dirty bandages appear and kidnap Hannah, taking her away through the jungle. The police are sceptical of Sarah and Paul's account, and a frustrated Paul searches for Catalina, desperate for answers. Catalina takes Paul to the church where he sees one of the children, following the boy back to a shanty house where he finds the parents of a boy who vanished mysteriously twenty years ago. Prior to his disappearance, the child exhibited the same symptoms as Hannah. Meanwhile, Sarah notices a drawing Hannah made of the dumbwaiter and investigates. Falling to the bottom of the shaft, she discovers the files of several children who died of mercury poisoning. Separately, Sarah and Paul make their way to the old paper mill where they meet and search for Hannah. Jordan aids in their search, crawling through a pipe to be confronted by the children, who begin to remove the bandages covering their burn-like rashes. He is attacked by the children because of his hiding the dead bodies instead of telling the police and the children's families about their deaths. He then sees Hannah and makes his way to her. Cradling his granddaughter, trickles of mercury emerge from her rashes and are absorbed by Jordan's body. Surrounded by the children, the mercury streaming from their bodies, he dies. Hannah awakens, now healthy, in her mother's arms. Over the credits, children play in a school named for the shanty town the missing children had lived in. Hannah is a student, and Catalina is now a teacher.

The company develops, manufactures, and sells high-performance automotive components for GM lines. Its founder, Aaron Pfadt \\\\faht\\\\, built the company into one of the leading developers of aftermarket Corvette and Camaro suspension components. It is one of the few companies in the United States that engineers, manufactures, and assembles all of its aftermarket performance products domestically for the GM line. In 2011 it was listed as one of Utah's fastest growing companies, ranking number 16. It has also been the receiver of other awards for its rapid growth and success as a leader in the automotive industry.http://www.apexedi.com/2011/10/06/apex-edi-one-of-utahs-fastest- growing-companys/  History  After engineering school Aaron Pfadt headed straight to Detroit to begin his career at General Motors. Working there instilled in him a passion for design and manufacturing excellence at a level worthy of the Corvette moniker. Weekends were spent at the race track learning the apex, pushing the limits, being free of the daily race. It was then that he realized the Corvette from the factory just needed a few truly race- inspired enhancements to make it competitive with the likes of Porsche and BMW. Shortly there after, he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, to found Pfadt Engineering. After experiencing a period of rapid growth in its core Corvette product lines the company launched new suspension lines for the Camaro and Cadillac ATS. It also launched exhaust headers for Corvette and Camaro, all manufactured in house at the Salt Lake facility. With this expansion the company sought and found a partner. Advanced FLOW Engineering, based in Corona, California, secured the company and continues to manufacture and sell the entire Pfadt product line. Under the company's new Advanced Control Engineering division and Pfadt's management, the new company continues to focus on suspension products and its advanced engineering focus.  Awards  In 2011 Pfadt Race Engineering achieved #16 on the Mountain West Capital Network's Utah 100 list of Fastest Growth Companies. The MWCN's Utah 100 rankings are determined from thousands of eligible companies throughout the state representing all industries. The rankings for 2011 were determined by the percentage of revenue increase from 2007 through 2011. In 2012 Pfadt Race Engineering achieved #59 on the Mountain West Capital Network's Utah 100 list of Fastest Growth Companies. The rankings for 2010 were determined by the percentage of revenue increase from 2006 through 2010.  Product line  Originally the GM-based track experience of owner Aaron Pfadt had a very strong influence on the initial product line. A majority of the original line was focused on C5 and C6 Corvette suspension. After quickly gaining recognition as one of the leading Corvette suspension experts, they soon diverted their efforts to expand the product line to include the fifth- generation Camaro as well. Among these changes, they have also shifted their focus to a line of power adding products such as performance exhaust headers and a turbo kit for the Cadillac ATS 2.0 L platform which is capable of producing over 450 HP. GM Factory driver Johnny O'Connell In 2010, Aaron Pfadt and Johnny O'Connell launched a new Corvette suspension line carrying O'Connell's signature and design input. This long-term partnership continues today. As a GM Factory driver, O'Connell has a record including four wins at LaMans, and as the driver of the championship Cadillac ATS., Engineered and built by Pfadt, the parts were tested and approved by O'Connell through rigorous track testing and street driving. As an aftermarket upgrade appropriate for both street and track use, the original package included sway bars and shock absorbers. After the growth in popularity of the line continued, the two paired again to launch a track day specific package featuring adjustable coil overs and adjustable sway bars. BMW Upon the acquisition by Advanced Flow Engineering, the company developed and launched a series of suspension components for the BMW. The lineup includes drop springs, sway bars and coil overs, all engineered, developed, and built in Corona, California. Ford Mustang The company entered the Ford Mustang market with a suspension package including lowering springs and sway bars.  Transition to AFE  With the growth in sales and additional product line launches the company worked to keep up with demand and ultimately found a partner in Advanced Control Engineering. After a brief downtime as the new deal was finalized, the new company came on line in August 2014 and products began to ship again and the customer service team addressed all open inquiries. Since the transition the company has launched new products for the BMW and the new Mustang, adding to the existing line up of GM-based products. Located on the 150,000-square-foot facility of the Corona, California, headquarters, the company continues to manufacture its core suspension and exhaust header lineup.

Life and career Leigh was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, and began his football career as an apprentice with Doncaster Rovers. He made his debut in February 1967, initially playing on the left of midfield, and made 37 league appearances before, in February 1968, he was part of a multiple transfer in which he and Graham Watson joined fellow Fourth Division club Rotherham United while Colin Clish, Chris Rabjohn and Harold Wilcockson moved in the other direction.

He averaged 40 games a season over his first four full seasons, but lost his place early in 1972‚Äì73 and was transfer-listed. In February 1973, Leigh became one of Graham Taylor's first signings for Lincoln City, choosing them ahead of Peterborough United.

Previously published under the pseudonym Remia (), she gained fame outside the Arab world when she recited a poem against fatwas on Million's Poet, an Emirati reality television poetry competition, and became the first woman to reach the program's finals. Early life and work Hilal, whose full name is Hissa Hilal al-Malihan al-‚ÄòUnzi, was born in the northwest of Saudi Arabia, near Jordan, in a Bedouin community, and began writing poetry at the age of 12, including on the themes of writing and justice. She hid her poetry from her family, who did not approve. She went to high school in Bahrain, where she encountered classic English literature, but was not able to attend university for financial reasons. Hilal was able to have some of her poems published in Saudi newspapers and magazines while working in a clerical position in a hospital in Riyadh, using the money from her first sales to buy a fax machine so that she could write arts articles from home. Hilal worked as an editor and correspondent for a number of newspapers and magazines in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region, and was also the poetry editor of al-Hayat. She published two poetry collections, The Language of the Sand Heap (1993) and The Bedewed One. During this time, she wrote under the pseudonym \\"Remia.\\" Hilal says that marrying gave her more creative freedom from her family, and that her four children are a source of stability. Her husband is also a poet. Hilal had wanted to compete on earlier seasons of Million's Poet, but her husband, while not refusing her the written permission that she as a Saudi woman would need to travel outside the country, was hesitant to grant it. It was for the fourth season that he gave her permission. Million's Poet Hilal and her poetry were praised enthusiastically by both the judges and the audience of Million's Poet. One judge said, \\"Her strength lies in the invention of images...Her poetry is powerful. She always has a message and a strong opinion, even on controversial subjects.\\" Hilal's most famous poem from the competition was \\"The Chaos of Fatwas.\\" It criticized in rhymed dactyls the \\"barbaric\\" clerics that run her country, condemning the violence and restrictions of rights precipitated by their fundamentalist stance. The poem was seen as responding specifically to recent remarks by Sheikh Abdul-Rahman al-Barrak which called for supporters of sex integration to be put to death. Hilal received death threats online for this poem. She says that she uses provocative language and imagery in her poems, such as a description of fundamentalist clerics that evokes an image of suicide bombers, because \\"extremism is so strong and you cannot talk about it in any other way.\\" Hilal's poem the subsequent week was 15 verses on a similar theme, and won her the top score of the round, a place in the final, and the judges' praise for her courage. Hilal's poem in the penultimate round said that media, a topic which the judges chose, could be used to fight ignorance and censorship. \\"I join the birds of light in a battle of enlightenment, we want to rise with a world that is fighting its ignorance.\\" Hilal came in third place in the competition, winning 3 million dirhams and prompting more women audience members to attend the final than ever before. Her final entry was an address from the poet to her poems: \\"You have a waving wing / You will not be betrayed by your open skies.\\" She received the highest score from the panel of judges, which counts for 60% of a contestant's final score, but did not gain enough of the audience vote to win the contest. The Independent writes that \\"Million's Poet is a particularly remarkable venue for her message given the conservatism of its format,\\" which promotes traditional poetry and may reach a wider and more conservative audience than more Western-influenced talent shows; because the genre is respected and traditional, the content is able to push boundaries. Hilal adds that since extremist clerics are able to hold support by using \\"the religious terms and expressions that are deep-rooted in everyone's psyche,\\" moderates should counter them using similar rhetoric rather than a modern language that people will not relate to. Analysts have suggested that this poetry form is increasingly being used to discuss social problems and that Hilal's participation will likely further that trend. Hilal's appearance on the program wearing niqab was noted in the media. She stated that she did this so that her male relatives, who support her poetry, would not be criticized by other men, and that she hoped her daughters would not have to cover their faces. Hilal said that her experience wearing niqab while traveling outside Saudi Arabia was part of what led to the composition of \\"The Chaos of Fatwas\\"; the negative reactions she received from westerners made her think of how extremists of her own religion have given all Muslims a bad name. Later work After participating in Million's Poet, Hilal published several more books. Divorce and Kholu' Poetry: A Reading of the Status of Women in Tribal Society and Nabati Poetry as a Witness (2010) is a collection of poems written before 1950 by Bedouin women. Hilal edited the collection, which she sees as demonstrating the freedom of speech and autonomy in family matters that women in Saudi Arabia had in former generations. The book contains poems by fifty women poets from different Bedouin tribes and is made up of two sections, \\"The Right of Choice\\" and \\"Rejection and Resistance.\\" The poems' date of composition varies, with the oldest over two centuries old and the newest about forty years. Hilal says of this book, \\"Tribal women used to recite poetry requesting a divorce, and when their husbands heard it, they would divorce them.\\" Many of the poems in the book were first collected by Abdallah ibn Raddas in the 1950s and 1960s and are based on stories from the oral tradition about women who sought separation from their husbands, whether out of desire for independence and free expression, frustration with a husband, or overbearing or sexist in-laws, or who were strong-willed in their response to divorce orders initiated by husbands. Hilal's anthology runs counter to the prevailing idea that modern society is more civilized than the tribal society of older days, and illustrates differences between gender roles in Bedouin desert communities and in the urban communities that came to dominate. Enlightenment (2011) is a compilation of Hilal's poems from the past decade, and includes \\"The Chaos of Fatwas.\\" References Further reading * External links * Hilal reads \\"The Chaos of Fatwas\\" * Full translation of \\"The Chaos of Fatwas\\" * Full translation of Hilal's final poem in the contest Category:Arabic-language women poets Category:Bedouins in Saudi Arabia Category:Living people Category:Proponents of Islamic feminism Category:Saudi Arabian feminists Category:Saudi Arabian journalists Category:Saudi Arabian poets Category:Saudi Arabian women journalists Category:Women poets Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century Saudi Arabian writers Category:21st-century Saudi Arabian women writers Category:21st-century journalists Category:21st-century poets ","title":"Hissa Hilal"},{"id":"39353620","text":"The Gereja Kristen Kalam Kudus () was a mission of the Evangelize China Fellowship in Indonesia.

It is the sequel to Plants vs. Zombies, and was released worldwide on Apple App Store on August 15, 2013 and Google Play on October 23, 2013. Plot The protagonist of the game uses a time machine named Penny to travel to different pseudo-historical settings with their neighbor, Crazy Dave, to find Dave's taco. The protagonist is engaged in a race through time with Dr. Zomboss, the main antagonist of the previous game, who is trying to prevent a paradox.In-game dialogue, Modern Day, Day 32 level. \\"Your reckless pursuit of an already-eaten taco has shattered all of time!\\" Gameplay Overview Plants vs. Zombies 2 is a freemium game, unlike its predecessor, supporting in-app purchasing of coins in order to utilize certain power up abilities: Plant Food, a new power-up, allows plants to power up for varying amounts of time. Each plant has its own ability when given Plant Food. Players can complete the whole game without purchasing these abilities, some of which can be earned throughout the game instead of being purchased. Additionally, users can level up their plants using Seed Packets (found in-game or bought with real moneyhttp://www.player.one/plants-vs- zombies-2-power-plants-update-seed-packets-will-strengthen-your-arsenal- new-577866) to allow them to permanently enhance their abilities. Players can start an optional tutorial which takes place in front of the player's house. Afterward, the player travels to Ancient Egypt and can win in-game World Keys by completing Day 6 to unlock a series of additional period settings (\\"worlds\\"); this required a certain number of stars in earlier updates. The Chinese version has four additional worlds, that is Kungfu World, Sky City, Steam Age, and Renaissance Age. As players go through levels, they unlock new plants each with advantages and unique boosts.

Cox Samuel P. Cox (December 16, 1828 ‚Äì August 21, 1913) was a businessman and farmer who is best remembered as the commander of the Union troops that killed \\"Bloody Bill\\" Anderson in the Battle of Albany in the American Civil War. An alleged attempt to assassinate Cox in 1869 in reprisal for the killing marked the first time that Frank James and Jesse James were publicly identified as outlaws. Early life Cox was born in Williamsburg, Kentucky. He moved with his parents to Daviess County, Missouri in 1839. He joined the Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1847. After the war he returned to Gallatin, Missouri and briefly settled in Grass Valley, Nevada and Oroville, California (1854‚Äì1856) before returning to Daviess County in 1857 where he was briefly a deputy sheriff. He worked for Russell, Majors and Waddell as a wagon master during the Utah War in 1858‚Äì59. Battle of Albany In 1861 Cox joined the Missouri Militia with the rank of major. During this time he was elected in absentia circuit clerk of Daviess County in 1862. He resigned in 1863, citing ill health, and returned to Gallatin. In 1864 he returned to the Missouri Militia, this time as a lieutenant colonel of the Thirty-third Regiment of Missouri State Militia. On September 27, 1864, Anderson's troops seeking to assist Price's Raid, a Confederate attempt to retake Missouri in the Civil War, killed more than 100 in the Centralia Massacre. Union soldiers were scalped, mutilated, and shot at point-blank range while unarmed, prompting an all-out effort to pursue Anderson. Among Anderson's men at Centralia were reported to be Frank James and Jesse James, although their notoriety had not been established at that point. Anderson held off the Union troops pursuing him using guerrilla attacks, by sending out small contingents which were attacked by Union troops which in turn were overwhelmed by hidden Confederate troops. On October 26, 1864 in the community of Albany, Missouri (now Orrick, Missouri and unrelated to another similarly- named town). Cox used Anderson's strategy against him, luring Anderson's men screaming the Rebel Yell to charge a seemingly vulnerable Union advance only to run into the guns of the Union lines. Anderson was shot twice in the back of the head. His body was taken back to Richmond, Missouri where it was placed on display. Various reports indicated that he had a scalp on his saddle and another report indicated that Anderson had 59 knots on a rope on his horse indicating the men he had killed. The attacking Confederate force only had included Anderson and five or six men (although some reports say 20) and the Confederate losses in the battle including the attacking line as well as those in the rear was just 7. Four Union soldiers were shot but no injuries were fatal. Gallatin Bank Robbery After the Civil War Cox returned to Gallatin, where he formed the mercantile firm of Ballinger, Cox & Kemper. Ballinger was another military officer and J.M. Kemper, a businessman who was the father of William Thornton Kemper, Sr. who went on to found two of the largest banks headquartered in Missouri (Commerce Bancshares and UMB Financial Corporation). Cox's business relationship with Kemper only lasted one year, dissolving in 1866. When Cox had first joined the Missouri Militia, his commanding officer was James H.B. McFerran who would found the Daviess County Savings Association. On December 7, 1869, two men (reported to be Frank and Jesse James) robbed the Daviess County Savings Association Bank and in the process shot the cashier John W. Sheets in the head and heart. Although there was $700 in the bank the robbers left with only $5 in fractional currency. The men were encountered near Kidder, Missouri where one of the men (believed to be Jesse) said that he was the brother of Bill Anderson and that he had avenged Anderson's murder by Cox. The Gallatin Bank Robbery marked the first time that Frank and Jesse were formally identified as bank robbers. A reward of $3,000 was raised for their capture. Jesse sent a letter to the Kansas City Times saying that he was innocent and could prove he was not in the area. He said he would surrender but was concerned that he would be lynched before he could prove his innocence. During the escape from Gallatin one of the robbers (believed to be Jesse) was thrown from his horse and dragged by the stirrup and after disentangling himself rode out on the horse of the other robber (believed to be Frank). They subsequently encountered Daniel Smoote and stole his horse. Smoote then filed a civil suit in Daviess County against the James brothers. They initially maintained their innocence and Jesse acknowledged the horse left in Gallatin was his but that he had sold it earlier. Eventually the James withdrew their defenses and allowed Smoote to take possession of the horse used in the robbery. After Jesse James was killed in 1882, Frank James surrendered to the authorities. Frank was not tried for the bank murder however he was tried in 1883 in Gallatin for an 1881 murder of a Rock Island Railroad employee at nearby Winston, Missouri. A jury acquitted him. Cox was reported to have been in California in 1869 visiting his parents and did not return until 1870 when he continued to operate other business including a hotel, livery and a different mercantile until formally retiring in 1871. He is buried in Brown Cemetery in Gallatin. References Further reading * Samuel P. Cox in Jordin, John F.

Born to a Methodist family in Maltby in Yorkshire, Ball was articled to the architect William Willmer Pocock in London in 1877, and moved to Birmingham in 1880 to set up in private practice after winning a competition to design the Handsworth Wesleyan Theological College, now the Hamstead campus of Birmingham City University. In 1881 he built a range of offices, shops and warehouses at the junction of Cannon Street and Cherry Street in Birmingham whose Queen Anne revival style marked one of the first signs of the new simplicity in Birmingham architecture that would emerge with the Arts and Crafts movement, in reaction against the heavily decorated terracotta style then prevalent. During the early 1880s, he trained Robert England from Christchurch in New Zealand; England would become a prominent architect in his home town. During the 1890s Ball emerged as one of the leading domestic architects in England and fully absorbed the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement, designing a series of one-off houses that gradually abandoned his earlier classical influences, culminating in the exceptional simplicity of the semi detached pair of houses he built for himself at 17 and 19 Rotton Park Road in Edgbaston. In 1899 Ball collaborated with William Lethaby on 122‚Äì124 Colmore Row in central Birmingham, whose break with revivalism makes it a building of European importance. In 1904 he completed Winterbourne House in Edgbaston, his most important individual commission and one of the finest houses of its period in the Birmingham area, comparable to contemporary work by other notable Birmingham Arts and Crafts architects such as William Bidlake, Charles Bateman and Herbert Tudor Buckland.

It was a remake of the original British television series of the same name, created by Roger Price, which ran from 1973‚Äì79. The series follows a group of young people who possess psionic powers as the result of human evolution. The Tomorrow People premiered on October 9, 2013 and ended on May 5, 2014. It originally aired Wednesdays at 9:00 p.m. Eastern/8:00 p.m. Central, but on March 17, 2014, it was moved to Mondays at 9:00 p.m. Eastern/8:00 p.m. Central. On May 8, 2014, The CW canceled The Tomorrow People after one season due to the low ratings. Premise The Tomorrow People are humans who, as a result of evolutionary development, have become early instances of the next state of human evolution ‚Äì Homo superior. However, while they are early examples of their particular human subspecies, they are not the first such generation to have developed such abilities- currently, the oldest Homo superior appear to have started to emerge thirty to forty years ago and exist across the world. As a consequence of their \\"breaking out\\" of the limitations of their pre-telepath developmental phase in young adulthood, they develop psionic abilities (the \\"Three T's\\" ‚Äì Telepathy, Teleportation and Telekinesis. A fourth T ability featured in the series is Temporal Manipulation). The series focuses on Stephen Jameson, a newly emergent member of the Tomorrow People, as was his father who, as the most powerful of the Tomorrow People, disappeared years before the current events in the series, trying to find a place where they could live safely. The Tomorrow People are hunted by Ultra, an anti-telepath genetic cleansing organization that uses Tomorrow People to hunt down others and neutralize, or kill, them; their headquarters are designed to neutralize the powers of Tomorrow People, although Stephen seems resistant to its effects. Outside Ultra, their parents, and their loved ones, the existence of the Tomorrow People is unknown to the general public, as they fear greater persecution. Consequently, they spend much of their time in the Lair, a subterranean base of operations beneath the streets of Manhattan. Cast and characters Main * Robbie Amell as Stephen Jameson, who suddenly experiences the onset of psionic abilities, realizing he is of a different human species. He is also a synergist: a second-generation telepath whose parents are both Homo superior. After joining the Tomorrow People, he joins their enemy Ultra as a double agent in order to take the evil group down. He quits Ultra after he found them trying to hunt Astrid down but soon agrees to continue working there. He was in a romantic relationship with Hillary until her death. At the end of the series, he becomes the Tomorrow People's latest leader. * Peyton List as Cara Coburn, one of the Tomorrow People who encountered her own psionic abilities five years prior to the series, when she was a deaf girl who was attacked by a teenaged boy, which caused her to accidentally kill him when using her powers. She was in a relationship with John. She has now been elected the leader of the Tomorrow People. When questioned who she would risk everything for, her answer was John. While she still loves him, she also has a strange bond with Stephen. * Luke Mitchell as John Young, leader of the Tomorrow People. He was in a relationship with Cara. He was also a former Ultra agent and Jedikiah's favorite prot√©g√©, and comes from a highly dysfunctional family background. Later voted out of his position as leader, then thrown out of the Tomorrow People group by Cara. Unlike other Tomorrow People, Ultra's Annex Project gave him the ability to kill deliberately as opposed to accidentally. He later bonds with Astrid Finch after she pulled the bullet out of him and it is later revealed that Cara is jealous. At the end of the series, he has temporarily lost but then regained his abilities, but has once more become a pawn of Jedikiah Price, former leader of anti-telepath organization Ultra. * Aaron Yoo as Russell Kwon, another member of the Tomorrow People. He fled his strict, overbearing Korean father and a prospective career as a prodigy concert pianist to become a petty thief. Later after cheating at various casinos, he gained a partner in crime \\"Talia\\", whom he turned in after she stole his money to begin a life of super heroism. How he first came in contact with the Lair is unknown but he is John's best friend. * Madeleine Mantock as Astrid Finch, Stephen's best friend and a 'Sap' (member of the species Homo sapiens). She learns about Stephen's powers and the world of the Tomorrow People, which soon puts her in danger. She has a close bond with Stephen and after nearly being killed twice, develops a close bond with John, who helps her get over her fears. * Mark Pellegrino as Jedikiah Price, Stephen's uncle, an evolutionary biologist and anti-telepath zealot who is head of Ultra. He was in love with a Tomorrow Person, Morgan, with whom he has fathered a (as yet unborn) child. However Jedikiah has a love/hate relationship with John Young, his former student whom he sees as a son, like John sees him as a father. Despite having tried to kill John numerous times, Jedikiah still cares for him, but later recruits John as the core of a new organization at the end of the series. Recurring * Sarah Clarke as Marla Jameson, wife of Jack/Roger and Stephen's mother. It is revealed that she is also an older first-generation Tomorrow Person which explains her son's rare ability to stop time like her husband, Jack, as well as his intensified psionic abilities relative to other, first-generation Tomorrow People like John, Cara, and Russell. * Jacob Kogan as Luca Jameson, Marla's son and Stephen's brother. He was suspected of being a Tomorrow Person like his brother Stephen, but was revealed to just be smoking cannabis. * Jeffrey Pierce as Jack Jameson/Roger Price, Stephen's father and Jedikiah's brother. He left Stephen's family when Stephen was a child. It is confirmed in the eighth episode that he had been shot by John after he was ordered to by Jedikiah, and in the fourteenth episode was found cryogenically frozen. He worked with Jedikiah and the Founder to create Ultra. * Alexa Vega as Hillary Cole, Ultra agent and one of Stephen's partners who has an initially adversarial but later romantic relationship with him. In the twentieth episode, she betrays Ultra and blows herself up with a bomb which is triggered by a phone call from Astrid to kill the Founder. Before doing this she told Stephen how much she loved him. * Meta Golding as Darcy Nichols, Ultra agent and one of Stephen's partners. In the sixth episode, it is revealed that she has a sister named Piper, however after betraying Ultra, she is shot dead. * Nick Eversman as Kurt Rundle, a guy with telekinesis powers.

Charlotte was experimented on at \\"The Citadel\\", an anti-telepath prison, but is later rescued by the Tomorrow People.) She appears to be closest to John. * Ben Hollingsworth as Agent Troy * Carly Pope as Morgan Burke, Jedikiah's girlfriend who is a Tomorrow Person and in the sixteenth episode, it is revealed that she is pregnant with his child. * Nicholas Young as Aldus Crick, a scientist who worked with Roger Price on researching the abilities of Homo superior. He was killed by Ultra. Nicholas Young played John in the original 1973‚Äì1979 series. * Serinda Swan as Cassandra Smythe, the Founder's daughter and a powerful synergist. Her father used her as a guinea pig for unknown experiments. She was accidentally killed by the Founder when he used his telekinesis to deflect a bullet that was meant for him. * Simon Merrells as Hugh Bathory, better known as \\"the Founder\\".

Sphecomyrminae contains eight genera, divided into two tribes Sphecomyrmini and Zigrasimeciini. The tribe Sphecomyrmini contains the six genera Armania, Cretomyrma, Gerontoformica, Orapia, Pseudarmania and Sphecomyrma; while Zigrasimeciini contains Boltonimecia and Zigrasimecia. A number of taxa have been removed from the subfamily and placed either in other subfamilies or are now treated as incertae sedis in Formicidae. Sphecomyrminae is the most basal of the Formicidae subfamilies, but has not been included in several phylogenetic studies of the family. Symplesiomorphies of the subfamily include the structure of the antenna, which has a short basal segment and a flexible group of segments below the antenna tip. The petiole is low and rounded, with an unrestricted gaster and the presence of a metapleural gland. The subfamily is characterized by three major synapomorphies, the short pedicel, a second flagellar segment that is double the length of the other antenna segments, and the loss of the apical end of the CuA veins in the wings of adult males. Tribes and genera A 2017 study recognized three tribes, Haidomyrmecini, Sphecomyrmini, and Zigrasimeciini and included the genera formerly placed in Armaniidae within the tribe Sphecomyrmini. Further review of the haidomyrmecins resulted in them being elevated to the separate subfamily Haidomyrmecinae and removed from Sphecomyrminae. *Sphecomyrminae Wilson & Brown, 1967 **Sphecomyrmini Wilson, Carpenter & Brown, 1967 ***Armania Dlussky, 1983 ***Baikuris Dlussky, 1987 ***Cretomyrma Dlussky, 1975 ***Dlusskyidris Bolton, 1994 ***Orapia Dlussky, Brothers & Rasnitsyn, 2004 ***Pseudarmania Dlussky, 1983 ***Sphecomyrma Wilson & Brown, 1967Zigrasimecia tonsora **Zigrasimeciini Borysenko, 2017 ***Boltonimecia Borysenko, 2017 ***Zigrasimecia Barden & Grimaldi, 2013 ***Protozigrasimecia Cao et al, 2020 The genus Sphecomyrmodes was formerly placed into Sphecomyrmini; however, in 2016, it was made a synonym of the stem group genus Gerontoformica, which was considered incertae sedis in Formicidae at the time.

The project is in association with Uthango Social Investments and Eclipse PR. The settlement is officially recognized as Symphony Way Temporary Location Area. The project is led by South African photojournalist Lizane Louw, and was active between 2008 and May 2012. The subject of the photographs are the substandard living space and the socioeconomic challenges of the residents.Louw, Lizane. Personal Interview. May 2013. Lizane's goal is to give the people of Blikkies a voice through the use of imagery and media presence attempt to spur change for this ineffective solution to Cape Town's eviction crisis. Since Lizane began her mission to capture the injustices of Blikkies, the settlement has grown almost 15 times larger, inflating from a population of 1600 to a count of 25000 in 2013, and now each structure houses between 5 and 15 people. The photos became the material of her first solo-exhibition which premiered in 2012. The photos are also a precursor to a documentary film that Lizane plans to shoot in 2014. Project History The Blikkiesdorp project began when Lizane was covering the settlement for a local newspaper called the Kaap Rapport to report on the unsatisfactory conditions of the community. The article has now turned into the material of a lifelong project. Lizane was inspired to inaugurate her Blikkies effort as an official documentary project when two of the elderly ladies she had been working with died of starvation and tuberculosis due to the circumstances living in the community. She learned over time that despite the government initiation of the project, the issues plaguing the area such as rape, prostitution, and both human and drug trafficking went unnoticed without any NGO or public organization working directly with the community. Rather than photograph these negative stories, she decided to focus on the inspiring and beautiful unsung parts of Blikkiesdorp. About the photographer Lizane Louw is a photojournalist, events photographer, and portrait photographer who has been active in the South African media industry since 2007. She served as a contract photojournalist for national publications of Media 24, Rapport, Kaap Rapport and Die Burger until December 2010. She published successfully in Huisgenoot, You, Beeld, The Argus, Cape Times, Mango Magazine, NRC, Nederland's Handelsblad, L'officiel NL, and Africa is a Country and various other local and international publications, print as well as online. As a freelance photojournalist, when in South Africa, she also contributes images to the Gallo Image Library and Africamediaonline. In 2008 she was nominated, with fellow journalist, Colin Hendricks, for Vodacom Journalist of the Year 2008, Category: Hard News, for a feature and investigative story, 'The Suitcase Murder' for Kaap Rapport. In 2011 she was published by the Royal School of Fine Art, Stockholm, Architecture Department and later that same year a selection of photographs from her archive was chosen by Utango, a Non Profit Company, for a WEF (World Economic Forum) event. The photos were used in a presentation to create awareness for Impact Investing in Africa. In September 2011, Louw was an official photographer of Archbishop Desmond Tutu's book launch, Tutu, the Authorized Portrait. Visual Representation Details The photos are intended to raise awareness about sanitation standards and living conditions which ignite comparisons to a concentration camp and cause symptoms of depression in the residents. Lizane's technique of documenting Blikkies involves a political strategy that shares the information through social media and exhibition channels such as Facebook and Twitter. She stresses telling the subject's stories without exploiting or abusing their sensitive experiences in conjunction with a political agenda. The photos focus on a sense of vulnerability, issues mainly of poverty, unemployment and crime. Lizane's shooting techniques include urban landscape photography, capturing everything as it was found, nothing fabricated for the purpose of photo aesthetic. The demographics of the subjects are unique for the cultural setting of the project, as the struggling residents of Blikkies are white, black, and coloured. Examples of the subjects she tries to capture are individuals who are completely dependent on donations for survival, as well as those who are challenged by the extreme weather due to feeble housing structures. She was also confronted with a spread of other issues plaguing the area, such as rape, prostitution, and both human and drug trafficking without any NGO working directly with the community. Louw gives a first-hand account of the Blikkiesdorp atmosphere: Rather than photographing only the negative aspects of these stories, she decided to combine on the inspiring and beautiful unsung parts of the wasteland by including images of motivated and heroic people as well as the family-like bond between the residents as a counterbalance. In order to locate her subjects, Louw collaborated heavily with community leader Bernadine de Kock, who is also running her own project in the Blikkies community working with food distribution. Bernadine would lead Lizane to willing individuals who were experiencing harsh circumstances that reflected standard challenges of the area. All the images can be found on the project's Facebook page and are shot with a Nikon D7000. Resident accounts The story that originally prompted Louw to create the Blikkiesdorp Project was the story of Ouma Magdalena. At 91 years old, she was the oldest resident in Blikkiesdorp. Ouma died in 2010 due to starvation, and she with her name on the public housing list as it had been for 17 years. Ouma died during the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in Cape Town, as millions of dollars were spent on funding for the event rather than communities like Ouma's. Adeen and Anton were a couple living in Blikkies together. Anton applied for and received his first disability grant at the end of May and left Adeen in Blikkies. Due to this, their \\"engagement\\" is off and also the wedding Adeen's mom, Tannie Elna, was dreaming about. Eileen Plaatjies was diagnosed with cancer last year. The doctors that was treating her, gave up hope and said there is nothing more to be done to help her in her fight against the disease. According to her caregivers, neighbors and woman from the Blikkiesdorp community, she was given two bottles of Liquid Morphine to drink and was sent home from hospital. Blikkiesdorp Project Press Articles about the Blikkiesdorp Project have been written by the Kaap Rapport, the Paperli blog, the Africa is a Country blog. A team of Journalists from TV Folha, Brazil, in 2011, who interviewed Louw about her work for the project to investigate South Africa and the Soccer World Cup of 2010 for a YouTube feature titled \\"Ap√≥s dois anos, √Åfrica do Sul ainda paga conta de est√°dios\\". The World Cup contributed to a spike in the population at Blikkies, as the city attempted to clean up the streets of its homeless vagrants or \\"Bergies\\", and planted them in Blikkies. The press has positively impacted the morale of the community, as Louw reports that \\"The pastors, priests and leaders of the community posted the page on walls and in the community halls\\".

The school was founded in 2007 by Robert L. Luddy and graduated its first senior class in 2016 with three seniors. As of 2019, there were over 3,000 students across eight campus locations in North Carolina. The Pre-K‚Äì12 college preparatory school was named for the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, often credited as the father of Greek Philosophy.  History  Thales Academy, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit school, was established in 2007 by Robert L. Luddy, a North Carolina entrepreneur, educator, philanthropist, and founder of CaptiveAire Systems. Prior to Thales, Luddy founded Franklin Academy in Wake Forest, one of the state‚Äôs largest charter schools, and St. Thomas More Academy in Raleigh, an independent Catholic college preparatory school. Luddy founded Thales in an effort to create a model school to offer a higher quality education than local schools at a more affordable cost. Since its founding, Thales Academy has opened eight locations, with more in development.  Locations  The front side of Thales Academy in Rolesville Current locations for Thales Academy are Rolesville, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Raleigh, Apex, Wake Forest, and Waxhaw, North Carolina, with developing campuses in Cary, and Pittsboro. The newly constructed, two-story brick buildings consist of approximately 20 classrooms on 34,000 square feet (grades K‚Äì5 campuses) or 55,000 square feet (grades 6‚Äì12 campuses). The buildings feature Greek columns, polished concrete floors, large windows, and painted classical murals in hallways in an effort to instill ‚Äúthe importance of order and beauty.‚Äù K‚Äì5 campuses offer playgrounds with artificial turf. Junior high and high school campuses offer full-sized gymnasiums and auditoriums as well as outdoor soccer fields.  Education methods  Thales Academy uses a classical education method to educate its students. In grades K‚Äì5, the school uses a methodology known as Direct Instruction (DI). DI uses repetition and frequent assessment to verify student achievement before moving to the next lesson. Lessons are fast-paced with choral responses to maintain student engagement.

His career spanned from 1937 to 1974, competing in bull riding, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, team roping, and steer wrestling. He was the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) World Bull Riding Champion in 1962. Brown was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for Bull Riding in 1979. Brown was also inducted into the inaugural class of the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2015. Brown was most famous for riding Tornado, who had an undefeated record of 220 riders. Brown was also a close friend and mentor of Lane Frost. Early career In 1937 Brown started in the rodeo at Willcox, Arizona at age 16. In 1941 he rode his horse to Cody, Wyoming,‚Äîa long distance‚Äîwhere he won his first bull trophy, then rode back again. World War II Brown enlisted to join the U.S. army, and undertook basic training in Fort Sill. He studied horseshoeing while stationed at Fort Riley. He was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and \\"did his part by helping to train Chinese paratroopers in secret\\". The war ended in the summer of 1945, and Brown \\"returned to China to compete in a Red Cross-sponsored event in which U.S. pack mules were used in place of saddle- broncs and barebacks and native cattle were rounded up for bull riding. Brown left China with the all-around title\\". 1962 World Championship Brown was injured badly in October 1962 at the rodeo in Portland, Oregon. While riding a bull name \\"Black Smoke\\" for 8 seconds, the bull flipped Brown, who fell on his head, paralyzing him. The doctor \\"pulled on his head and feeling returned to his right side and left foot\\". He was operated on and put in traction for 34 days, followed by a plaster cast \\"from his waist to the top of his brow for over 2 months\\". He had saved enough money to win the Championship. His earnings in 1962 were $18,675. During that year he won the World Bull Riding Championship at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) while he was on the sidelines watching. Tornado, the unrideable bull Brown is remembered for riding an \\"unrideable\\" bull named Tornado in December 1967. The bull, owned by Jim Shoulders, had thrown over 200 riders over a 14-year period before Brown's successful ride, and was considered the ultimate challenge on the bull-riding circuit, but Brown stayed on for the 8 seconds required, in front of 6,000 people. Tornado died in 1972 as unridden by 220 professional riders except for Brown and two others, and was buried on the grounds of the Cowboy Hall of Fame, near two notable bucking horses, Midnight and Five Minutes Til Midnight. Brown, this ride, and Tornado are all memorialized in Red Steagall's song, \\"Freckles Brown\\".Cathy Logan, \\"Freckles Brown's ride on Tornado is the stuff of songs and legends\\", Tulsa World, January 5, 2006.

Brown had a wife named Edith, and a daughter named Donna Harrison, and two grandchildren. Brown had retired at age 53 to his 600-acre ranch in Soper, Oklahoma. Brown was found to have prostate cancer in November 1982. He was advised to go to Houston for radiation treatment, but was determined to go to the December finals beforehand, where a dance was held to raise funds to support his treatment. By March 1983 he had returned home to give interviews. His cancer returned in 1987, after being in remission for four years. Another fundraiser was planned for March 1987, but Brown died two days before at his ranch in Soper, Oklahoma. The fund raiser went forward nevertheless and US$41,000 was raised to help with Brown's medical bills. He was a friend and mentor to bull riding champion Lane Frost, who is buried next to him in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Hugo, Oklahoma.\\"Cowboy's funeral draws throng\\", AP in Tulsa World, August 3, 1989.

It is a large post mill, built above a roundhouse, used for grinding wheat flour. It is the only windmill in the Netherlands that drives three pairs of millstones. The mechanism is mostly wooden, since iron was expensive when it was built. The windmill, which is still functional, can be rotated on its post to face the wind for maximum effect. History \\"Tot Voordeel en Genoegen\\" (to advantage and satisfaction) was built in 1798 for P. van Dam. It is beside the river so it catches as much wind as possible. The last miller to own and operate it was van Dreumel, to whom farmers in the Alphen area regularly brought their flour to be ground until 1978. The municipality of West Maas en Waal now owns the mill, which is still functional, and may be visited for tours and demonstrations. The mill was completely restored in 1964, and moved about . The post is no longer elm, but is now made from bilinga wood. The sides of the box are now also made from this wood. Description The windmill's sails have a wingspan of . The whole upper part of the mill is built around a vertical timber post about thick. The upper part, which weighs , can be turned on this axis to orient the blades so they get maximum force from the wind. The lower part of the windmill is a brick roundhouse. The ropes are made from flax, which was once grown in the area, and the gears are wooden. Use of iron was avoided wherever possible due to the cost. The mill is unique in having three sets of millstones, each of which can be operated independently. The main drive from the upper wheel turns the forward wheel, which in turn drives the two rear wheels. This differs from most post mills, where there are two sets of millstones, each driven directly by the upper wheel. The forward and the left rear mills have artificial stones with a diameter of .
