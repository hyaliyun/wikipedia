History =As Officer= He was known have kept personal copies of the works of Alexander Herzen, published in London, in his own officer's library. =With the Anarchists= Kukel's aide-de-camp was the famous Anarchist, a young Peter Kropotkin, with whom Kukel had shared an interest in geography. In this connection Kropotkin had applauded Kukel's efforts at reforming the prison system, while at the same time criticizing Kukel for not going far enough in the direction of progress, liberty, and human dignity. Kropotkin would eventually inspire Kukel with higher standards of living for Russian prisoners. Kukel would eventually be fondly remembered by the anarchist in his memoirs, Memoirs of a Revolutionist. Kropotkin would say that when Kukel, the reader of Alexander Herzen, was finally recalled from his post, he decided that it was time to become an explorer. While on assignment in Siberia, Kukel introduced Alexander II to the poet, Mikhail Larionovitch Mikhailov, and he suggested to Peter Kropotkin that he should meet Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the Mutualist-Anarchist from whom many more modern currents of Anarchism sprung. Mikhail Bakunin's escape from Russian authority has been connected with the feud between Kukel and Governor-General Korsakov. Between his connections with Bakunin and with those of Kropotkin, Kukel is probably the most Anarchist- inspired of all Russian generals. There are some who suggest that his cooperation with anarchist Bakunin and poet Mikhail Larionovitch Mikhailov were responsible for his fate of being replaced. Without Kukel, it's quite possible that modern Anarchism would never have assumed the libertarian, collectivist aspect that Kropotkin and Bakunin had so much preached for.

It was a crucial event during the Brabant Revolution: the Patriots received a major boost by taking this first large city, and the authority of the Austrian Netherlands was beginning to disintegrate. Within two weeks, the Treaty of Union was drafted, that would establish the independent republic of the United Belgian States on 11 January 1790. On 4 January 1790, Flanders declared its independence from the Habsburg Monarchy by the Manifesto of the Province of Flanders.  Background  Ghent was not a bulwark of Patriot activity. Therefore, the Austrian military governor Richard d'Alton judged it useful to concentrate his troops in De Kempen and around Li√®ge, and leave only a garrison of 300 men in Ghent (two companies of the Vierset regiment). According to his expectations, the Committee of Breda, which had retreated its small Patriot army after its victory in the Battle of Turnhout (27 October 1789), would focus its attention again on Brabant. Patriot leader Jan Frans Vonck, who had always been advocating an attack on Flanders, was now able to gather support for this plan, especially after notary Jan Baptist Cammaert had crossed the border in the beginning of November to confirm the information on the small Ghent garrison.Van Aerde, p. 125 On 4 November, the French major Philippe Devaux advanced from Roosendaal with 800 soldiers to the Waasland. After crossing the river Scheldt on 7 November at the former fort Frederik Hendrik in Berendrecht with some difficulties, and being reinforced with 200 Patriots from the camp of Hulst, he encamped in Sint-Niklaas on 9 November. The population reacted with caution rather than enthusiasm. The Waasland volunteers who joined the Patriot army were fewer than hoped for, but in his justification after the fact, d'Alton reported them to have numbered 500. The rebels put themselves in motion, and picked up several small cannons at the D'Ursel Castle, as promised by Duchess d'Ursel. Meanwhile, the Austrian response was rather slow. D'Alton was not informed of the movements until 8 November, at which point he urgently sent reinforcements under Gontroeul and Gottfried von Schr√∂der; however, because of lingering, they lost three more valuable days, and were no longer able to cut off the road to Ghent. Then d'Alton also sent a regiment (c. 2,400 infantrymen) led by Nicolas Antoine d'Arberg to Ghent, where the garrison was also strengthened by the 600 men advancing from Aalst under colonel Jacques- Henri de Lunden. Only Lunden would arrive in time, meaning that Ghent was defended by about 900 men when the Patriots appeared before the city gates on Friday 13 November.  Course  Belfry and Dulle Griet as symbols of Ghent. On the morning of 13 November, just before 7 a.m., Devaux ordered a charge on the Bruges Gate (Brugse Poort) and the Sas Gate (Saspoort). A simultaneous attack on the Antwerp Gate (Antwerpse Poort) was carried out to distract the enemy. Noting that a handful of gate guards spread great confusion amongst his inexperienced troops, Devaux simply gave up. He departed back to the Netherlands, together with Louis de Ligne, his staff and all eight dragoons of the army.Van Aerde, pp. 125‚Äì126. However, the Patriots would not yield so easily, and continued under the command of captain Jean-Baptiste Davaine. They took the Bruges Gate, and the Sas Gate with some difficulty as well, and advanced towards the Kouter square in the centre. There they clashed with the barricades put up by Lunden at strategic locations in the city (Madou Bridge, Ketel Bridge, Muink Bridge, Heuver Gate and Kortrijk Gate). His main force was garrisoned inside Saint Peter's Abbey, and the Spanjaardenkasteel ('Spaniards' Castle') also had a small occupation force.Van Aerde, p. 128. The Patriots pushed the Imperials back far beyond the Madou and Ketel bridges. When the night fell, plundering started. Primarily the Imperial troops, most notably the \\"Clerfayt\\" Regiment, badly misbehaved by robbing, raping and killing about.Van Aerde, pp. 129‚Äì131. Both Imperial and Patriot sources report an astonishing lack of discipline amongst the Imperial soldiers, and that their crimes committed against civilians at the early stages of combat was a crucial factor in motivating the civilian population of Ghent to side with the rebels.Van Aerde, pp. 133‚Äì134. The Patriots aimed for the houses of royalist dignitaries, many of which were razed to the ground.Van Aerde, p. 130. By now, they received almost full support from the Ghent locals, who broke up entire streets in order to throw paving stones at the Imperials.Van Aerde, p. 131. The Austrian reinforcements arriving during the night (Gontroeul's c. 2,400 menVan Aerde, pp. 131‚Äì132.) and morning were informed of this, and decided to take up positions inside the Spanjaardenkasteel after passing through the Antwerp Gate. Turnhout had taught them to be careful with urban combat. On Saturday 14 November, Arberg ordered a bombardment on the city from the Spanjaardenkasteel, which was now defended by several thousands of soldiers. This caused fires at several places. From inside the Kattenberg barracks, Lunden tried to alert his allies to his precarious position by firing several cannon shots, but they were lost in the clamour of battle. A detachment of a hundred soldiers which he ordered to sally forth, was caught and neutralised.Van Aerde, p. 132. At dusk, new attempts at plundering were made from the Spanjaardenkasteel, but the defenders were prepared and drove them back, inflicting heavy losses.Van Aerde, p. 133. The following day, 15 November, commenced with a fresh bombardment, followed by an Imperial sortie from the castle the around noon. The Patriot soldiers fired with many rifles, while civilians threw stones and other debris from rooftops at the Austrians. Schr√∂der, bothered by his defeat in Turnhout, fought in the front line. After just 15 minutes of fighting, a 14-year-old rebel firing a large nail from a kind of self-made blunderbuss struck his leg, after which Schr√∂der ordered a retreat. Emboldened by this success, many Patriots wanted to storm the Kattenberg barracks in a rush, but Devaine managed to retain their discipline and ordered an end to the fighting for the day.Van Aerde, p. 135. Around nightfall, the city administration granted the Patriots permission to take weapons and ammunition from the city storages. Moreover, captain Alison with 250 fighters from Kortrijk and four cannons came to reinforce the rebels. On 16 November, with renewed courage, the Patriots assaulted the barracks garrisoned by Lunden, whose troops were suffering from food shortages. The rebels set a storage on fire and shelled the barracks with the Kortrijk guns. Soon after, the colonel appeared in front of a window with a white flag to surrender the barracks. His men were spared from the people's rage, and imprisoned in monasteries. Next, the liberation committee sent a message to the Spanjaardenkasteel that the bombardments had to cease if they wished to spare the lives of Lunden and his officers. The threat worked. In fact, the Imperials silently abandoned their citadel in the night of 16 to 17 November. The Patriots were utterly surprised when they discovered the Austrian withdrawal the next morning.Van Aerde, pp. 135‚Äì137. Contrary to Arberg's orders, his rearguard had not burnt the citadel's supplies, perhaps for fear of them falling into rebel hands. When the retreating Imperial army marched to Brussels, many soldiers born in the Southern Netherlands deserted; many of them were caught by the peasant population and carried off to Ghent; they killed some of the plundering deserters.Van Aerde, p. 137. Inside the city, 27 houses were burnt down, with dozens of others damaged. 600 Imperial soldiers were killed, 200 were wounded, and over a thousand had been made prisoners of war, held captive in monasteries. The Patriot army suffered 32 casualties, while 79 Ghent civilians were killed in the fighting, 31 of whom were unarmed.  Aftermath  Because of the conquest of Ghent, the rest of the county of Flanders sided with the Patriots in a matter of days. The Imperial forces, plagued by desertion, surrendered Brussels almost without a fight. Within several weeks, they were pushed back beyond the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge (which at the time was controlled by the pro-Patriot Li√®ge Republic) towards the Fortress of Luxembourg. Emperor Joseph II was not amused: after the loss of Ghent, he suspended Schr√∂der, disgraced d'Alton and forced Arberg to resign. The emperor soon entered his deathbed, and told prince Charles de Ligne that it was because of the Brabant Revolution: :'Votre pays m'a tu√©: Gand pris a √©t√© mon agonie; et Bruxelles abandonn√©e, ma mort.' :('Your country has killed me: the capture of Ghent was my agony, and the abandonment of Brussels was my death'). After Joseph's death, the United Belgian States managed to consolidate themselves for several months. However, the Patriots would suffer from internal strife in this time, and failed to prepare themselves for a new Austrian offensive. General Bender would put a relatively quick end to the first Belgian adventure of independence in November and December 1790. The First Austrian Restoration would last until the French revolutionary army under Dumouriez crushed the Imperials again in the Battle of Jemappes (6 November 1792).

It sits next to Aichi K≈çgen Quasi-National Park, and is a popular tourist destination, famous for its autumn foliage and its Erythronium japonicum flowers. Background Taigetsu Bridge In 1634, Kazuhisa Sanei, the 11th head priest of K≈çjakuji Temple, is said to have planted maple and cedar trees in Asuke, on the approach from Yodogawa to Kasuji. Many maples have, since then, been planted by residents. It is said that 11 different types of maple trees have been planted at Korankei. A walking path has been built around the North side of the river valley. The Taigetsukyo bridge () was named the symbol of the river in 1953. After three changes, the bridge was finally settled on as a symbol in 2007. In 1930, when the priest and hamlet mayor were asked by Osaka Mainichi Shimbun about the naming, the answer given was \\"From Iimori-yama hill comes a balmy breeze, going over the Tomoegawa, and through Seifu on the approach to Kozaku-ji.

Pelang or pilang is a traditional boat from Indonesia and Malaysia. It may refer to several different type of boats in the Nusantara, but commonly they refer to outrigger canoe. The function differs from where they were used, from transporting people, fishing, to trading. Pilang has been known from at least the 14th century.Hikayat Banjar, 1.2: Then Ampu Djatmaka sailed with the same boat following it. Kapal and pilang are not as speedy as Si Prabayaksa; the size and the length and the ornamentation [of them] does not surpass Si Prabayaksa.  Etymology  The name \\"pelang\\" can be traced from Old Javanese word pelang which means freight boat or a type of ancient merchant boat.Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder, 1982, Old Javanese ‚Äì English Dictionary, The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff. 2 v. (xxxi, 2368 p.) In collaboration with S.O. Robson. The Great Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI) explain it as \\"trading boat\\". According to M. Rafiek, pelang is a rather large boat used to sail through the Java sea. A pelang with outboard engine as its main propulsion. In northern Sulawesi, It was originally a term for a mahera-based boat (mahera means dugout - the base keel made from a whole piece of hollowed wood), but with the influx of Filipino technology (see vinta), then a boat made of waterproof plywood can also be referred to as a pelang.  Description  In western part of Nusantara, it refers to a large, flat bottomed canoe-like boat with one mast, stepping a lug sail made of cloth. Usually built of giam wood. H. Warington Smyth noted the dimensions of a pilang: About 42 ft (12.8 m) long, 5 ft (1.5 m) wide, 2 ft 3 in (69 cm) draught, with 1 ft (30 cm) of freeboard. The capacity was 1 koyan (2.419 metric tons). The mast itself is about 40 ft (12.2 m) tall. In the eastern part of Nusantara, the name refers to small, canoe- like outrigger boat. In Northern coast of Sulawesi, pelang refers to outrigger fishing boat. North Sulawesian pelang is about 6-8 m in length, 1 m in width and crewed by 4-6 men. This pelang has an operational range of 5-7 miles (8-11.3 km). The Mahera (dugout base) does not have enough height to be used as a boat. Thus, the mahera is in the form of the flat keel of wood with a slight curvature. To improve the seaworthiness, additional side planks were added. The side planks are made of marine plywood with some frame construction and side beams as reinforcement. Modern pelang of Northern Sulawesi were equipped with outboard motors. The motor gradually replaced the sail in the 1970s. A pelang that has been fitted with lamps and generator for light fishing. There are also pelang that are equipped with lamps and electric generator for light fishing. Lights were used to attract fish for improving the quantity of the catch. The raw material is marine plywood with a length of about 7 m.

Much of the castle was destroyed during the Japanese colonial period, but the remains of the south gate are well-preserved; it is a majestic dragon gate in the style of Confucian Chinese architecture. Notably, the Tonggun Pavilion was the northern terrace of the Castle. It is cited as one of the Eight Scenic Spots in the Kwanso Area of the country. History During the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592, King Seonjo of Joseon took refuge at Uiju, taking the ancestral tablets from Jongmyo and the shrines with him; the tablets were returned to Seoul in October of 1593. Im Gyeong-eop was in charge of the castle in the early 17th century. During the Manchu invasion of Korea in 1636, Qing soldiers were able to sneak into the fortress through a drainage hole and opened the gate of the fortress. In June 2015, a painting dated from 1723 depicting the castle, was found in the collections of the Yamaguchi Prefectural University, having never before seen by the public. It was likely brought to Japan by Terauchi Masatake, among other items smuggled into Japan by Masatake.

He is a tenure-track professor in Sustainable Food Processing at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. His work primarily focuses on finding sustainable and nutritional food and animal feed alternatives that would improve the sustainability performance. Research career Mathys earned his Doctor of Engineering from the Technical University of Berlin in 2008. While there, he studied food technology and food preservation processes. He wrote his thesis on the effects high pressure thermal sterilization on Geobacillus and Bacillus spores. His work on this topic earned him several awards, including the George F. Stewart IFT International Research Paper Competition Finalist in 2007 and the ICEF \\"Young Food Engineer\\" award in 2008. He went on to work at the Nestl√© Research Center in Lausanne, Switzerland from 2009 to 2012. After that, he developed the Bioeconomy department at the German Institute of Food Technology. He was designated a \\"Young Researcher\\" at the 60th Meeting of Nobel Laureates in 2010. That year, he was also given the \\"Einstein Scholarship Award\\" at the Falling Walls conference. For each of the following two years at the conference, Mathys was designated an A.T. Kearney Scholar, as well. In 2015, he became a tenure-track professor in the Sustainable Food Processing program at ETH Zurich. In general, much of Mathys' research deals with the study of global food systems and the environmentally unsustainable production of meat. By 2050, meat production is expected to reach 470 million tons annually, double the amount produced in 2018. Mathys' research has focused on the idea that a largely meat-based diet contributes to environmental degradation through the depletion of resources and an increase in the pollution of air, water, and soil. He also notes that a transition to a largely plant-based diet would improve those conditions while also optimizing health and nutrient indicators. =Algae as a food source= As the head of the Sustainable Food Processing Laboratory at ETH Zurich, Mathys has researched a variety of sustainable food alternatives, including algae. In 2016, he collaborated with the B√ºhler Group on a project to design algae-based biorefineries to cultivate and process algae as a human food source. His research on the topic has suggested that microalgae can be integrated into food sources as a bulk protein while also providing other nutritional and health benefits including antioxidative, anticoagulant, immunomodulatory, and antihypertensive activities (among others). The high protein content in certain algae may also make it an appropriate replacement for meat, which could reduce the impact that traditional meat sources place on the environment. Mathys' research has also pointed out that wide-scale cultivation and processing of microalgae is not yet competitive with current biorefinery concepts and technology. Mathys is currently researching nanosecond pulsed electric field treatment as a method of effectively producing algae for human consumption. His work aims to optimize the effectiveness of algae cultivation and processing in the future. Mathys' research is also looking at broader applications of microalgae cultivation, including as a food source and life support system for astronauts traveling long distances and/or creating colonies on other planets. =Insects as food and animal feed= In addition to algae, Mathys has also researched the efficacy of cultivating and processing insects for both human and animal consumption. He has noted that insects provide a high-protein content and can be cultivated more efficiently than traditional meat sources. He has also stressed that more research is required to study the efficacy of insects for wide-scale human consumption. His research has also looked at insects as a more environmentally-sustainable source for animal feed. In a 2017 collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Mathys and other researchers from ETH Zurich studied the consumption of biowaste by black soldier fly larvae. The larvae were able to effectively utilize the waste (which included discarded household food and restaurant scraps), allowing for a more sustainable method of eliminating that waste. The larvae could then be used as animal feed with less harmful environmental effects than traditional feed sources, such as fish meal.

Early and personal life He was born in England, likely in Essex and emigrated to Dedham, Massachusetts, becoming a proprietor of that town in 1637. Hinsdale married as his first wife, probably in England, Ann Woodward, the daughter of Peter Woodward of Dedham. With her he had six sons and two daughters: Elizabeth, Barnabas, Samuel, Gamaliel, Mary, Experience, John, and Ephraim. Ann was a sensitive and timid woman and she fainted when asked to make a public profession of her faith to join the First Church and Parish in Dedham on June 2, 1639. She died June 4, 1666. Hinsdale married second for a second time around 1668 to Elizabeth Hawks, the widow of John Hawks of Hadley. They had no children. Elizabeth was a woman of different mold from Ann. The union did not prove a happy one and they soon parted. At court on March 30, 1674, they were charged with living separately and with \\"lascivious and wanton carrage.\\" Elizabeth refused to answer the charges and appears to have gotten off clear. The court found Hinsdale guilty, however, and ordered him whipped ten stripes on the naked body. The court also imposed a fine for which his sons became responsible and which the court refused to remit after his death. The inventory of Robert Hinsdale's estate was taken October 22, 1676. His son Ephraim was surety for Elizabeth, his step mother. Dedham Early Dedham records show Hinsdale was a faithful attendant on town meetings and he appears to have been a valuable and public spirited member of the community. He was elected a member of the very first Board of Selectmen on July 18, 1637 and was reelected on May 17, 1639, December 31, 1639, and January 1, 1645. On March 13, 1639 he was admitted freeman of Massachusetts Colony. He was one of the eight founders of the First Church and Parish in Dedham on November 8 1638. It took months of discussions before a church covenant could be agreed upon and drafted. The group established thirteen principles, written in a question and answer format, that established the doctrine of the church. With the doctrinal base was agreed upon, 10 men, including Hinsdale, were selected to seek out the \\"living stones\\" upon which the congregation would be based. The group began to meet separately and, one by one, they would leave the room so that the others could elect or reject them. They decided that Hinsdale and five others, John Allen, Ralph Wheelock, John Luson, John Fray, and Eleazer Lusher were suitable to form the church. He has been described as a \\"pillar of the church\\" in Dedham. On January 1, 1645 he was part of a unanimous vote to establish the first public school in the United States, what has become the Dedham Public Schools. They agreed to raise the sum of twenty pounds per annum in support of the school. In 1645, he was chosen a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the oldest military organization in this country. Medfield On November 14, 1649 he was appointed one of a committee of Dedham citizens to organize a new town which afterwards came to be Medfield, Massachusetts. He was one of those who negotiated a payment of ¬£50 pounds, payable by the Medfield settlers to the Dedham proprietors, for the rights to all the lands in Medfield. He was among the first thirteen who took up houselots at Medfield and his homestead there was on what is now North Street in 1652. Soon after the town granted him 46 acres of land near what was later known as Collin's Mill. He started his life n Medfield as he left it in Dedham, as a respected and prosperous member of the community. Hinsdale was chosen one of its first Selectmen and served six years in that capacity. He was active in organizing the first Medfield church. In 1659, he purchased a bell and brought it up for the use of the town. Hinsdale had a series of unfortunate events in Medfield, however. He built a mill there, but it was burned by Indians in 1676. On August 20, 1663, he and his wife Ann conveyed his 90 acre farm in Medfield to Jeremiah Tauke, a citizen and clothworker of London, as payment for a ¬£153 debt. He had mortgaged all his other land in Medfield in 1656 and eventually turned it over to Samuel Shrimpton, a wealth merchant. Deerfield About 1667, he removed with his family to the Connecticut Valley, settling first at Hadley, Massachusetts. It was there in 1672 when he was released from military duty on account of age and a sore leg. He was an original proprietor in the 8,000 acre grant given to the Dedham people at Deerfield. Being a remote outpost, the settlement was vulnerable to attack. He drew lot 31 in 1671, the site of the Willard House in the early 1900s. He and his four sons were inhabitants of Deerfield by November 13, 1673 and he began clearing his land for agriculture. He was the deacon of the first church there and one of the principal and most active citizens. He and his son Samuel, Sampson Frary, John Farrington, and Samuel Daniel were the only men of the original 32 Dedham proprietors of Pocumtuck, the native people's name for the area, who became actual settlers of Deerfield. The others sold out their rights. Hinsdale and his three sons, Samuel, Barnabas, and John, were slain by King Phillip and his men at the Battle of Bloody Brook on September 18, 1675. Eight women of Deerfield were made widows that day, including the four wives of Robert and his three oldest sons.

Premise Taking place after a long war between humans and monsters ended, the story focuses on the human Dr. Glenn Litbeit and his lamia assistant, Saphentite \\"Sapphee\\" Neikes, as they run a clinic in the city of Lindworm which is home to many species of monsters living alongside humans. Characters ; : :The main character, Glenn is a human male from a merchant family from the far east, who specialized in medicines during the war. He strives to become a doctor for the monster population of the city of Lindworm. His calm demeanor and quick mind and focus allows him to treat everyone from a harpy girl to an immortal dragon. This tends to make him have a cadre of girls vying for his affection, much to the annoyance of Sapphee. ; : :Glenn's childhood friend and assistant in the clinic who goes by the nickname of \\"Sapphee\\". She organizes the clinic and monitors the fairies that assist them. She is a rare albino lamia so she has to wear a special outfit whenever she goes out into the sunlight. Her family were also merchants during the war, allying with the Litbeit family to aid the wounded and ensure medicine production on both sides. She was sent to the Litbeits as a political hostage where she met Glenn and fell in love with him. However, her family are also well known assassins and if the Litbeits were to betray them, she was set to kill Glenn's family. She also has a low tolerance for alcohol. ; : :A centaur who is the sole heiress of Scythia Transportation. A high ranked arena fighter, she was on a losing streak until Glenn realized her problem and was able to help her by giving her horseshoes. She is very open about her infatuation for Glenn and is not afraid to say so in public, mostly to annoy Sapphee, who she considers to be a friend and romantic rival. ; : : A mermaid who sings at the Merrow Waterways. She does this in order to provide financial support for her family. Even while suffering from inflammation of her gills due to staying above and out of water, she continued singing. She saved a boy from drowning and Glenn saves her from drowning due to her gills. She develops feelings for Glenn after he saved her and treated the inflammation. ; : :An arachne who is a fashion designer, by sewing clothes with her own silk. She is a friend of Sapphee and has known her for a long time and has made several of her sunblocking outfits due to arachne silk being very durable. Her skill is so good, she can do minute stitchwork swiftly and efficiently (such as a surgeon). She tries to seduce Glenn originally to get a response from Sapphee and Tisalia, but soon realizes that she has fallen for him herself. ; : :The chairwoman and head council representative of Lindworm. She was the dragon that was able to bring the humans and monsters together before they could destroy each other completely, bringing an end to the war and founding the city as an experiment to see if monsters and humans can co-exist. She is hundreds of years old, yet has the body of a young girl. She dresses head to toe in robes and a veil so few have seen her face, but they are used to hide a parasitic condition. Due to the condition, she rarely speaks above a whisper so her words are relayed by Kunai, but for those who have heard her speak normally say they can hear the power she possesses as well as her feelings. After the parasite is excised by Glenn and Cthulhy at the end of Volume 3, she is able to speak normally, and from time to time act impulsively and even childishly (such as challenging Tisalia during her promotion match, or sneaking midnight snacks), including declaring that she is interested in Glenn, much to Sapphee, Tisalia, and Kunai's chagrin. ; : :The personal assistant and bodyguard to Lady Skadi. A rare flesh golem from the east, she was taken in by Skadi and becomes entirely devoted to her and takes her job seriously. However, due to her nature, she has been known to lose parts if she is damaged. Due to how she was created she is not fond of doctors and she can hear the voices of those of the body parts she is created from. While she is very proud of her warrior nature, her heart is that of a pure maiden who develops feelings for Glenn after he helps repair her during a mission. Now she goes to him whenever she needs to replace her stitches or parts, because as he helps her, the voices are a lot quieter. ; : :A harpy who was captured by bandits and forced to lay eggs to be sold. However, she had an impacted egg from stress until Glenn helped her while Skadi and Sapphee held off the remaining bandits. Afterward, she and the others went to a nearby harpy village to live. However, she soon began to possess a stubborn and rebellious streak which made the rest of the village upset. It is soon discovered that she is one of the rare phoenix harpy bloodline thought to be extinct due to the war. She now works as a messenger for the village and Skadi due to her fast flight ability and memory skills. She is also drawn to Glenn due to him saving her. ; : :A cyclops who works at the Kuklo Workshop. She has issues due to dry eye because hers is larger than the others. However, it gives her more clarity in very fine work such as detailing and making surgical instruments like scalpels and needles that the hospital and Glenn use. She was inspired by Skadi to try to make things people could use to live. She also likes wearing Gothic Lolita outfits created by Arahnia. She seems to have feelings for Glenn but often felt embarrassed when get closer to him. ; : :A centaur who is one of Tisalia's attendants. She was a war orphan who was adopted by the Arte family, servants of the Scythia family. ; : :A centaur who is one of Tisalia's attendants. Like Kay, Lorna was a war orphan who was adopted by the Arte family. Due to her being more sensitive than Tisalia and Kay, she suffers from self-esteem issues and needs a more controlling hand than Kay. ; : :A rare gigas who lives near the harpy village and sees Glenn for a head cold while he was performing examinations at the village. Due to her size, she moves very slowly and carefully so not to injure any smaller creatures, but every step causes earthquakes and landslides. Though young for her race, she still is hundreds of years old and has known Ctulhy and Skadi for a long time. She is friends with Illy, who goes to her mountaintop to visit her. She is the one that identifies the parasitic heart of Skadi as a shoggoth. ; : :A Scylla who is the head medical doctor of the Lindworm Central Hospital. Cthulhy is the mentor and primary teacher of Glenn and Sapphee who had them start the clinic to expand their learning of medicine and to groom Glenn to take over for her one day. She has known Skadi for a long time, hinting she is hundreds of years old despite looking like she is in her 30s. She enjoys openly flirting with Glenn, much to the annoyance of Sapphee. ; :The former shoggoth that was attached to Skadi. Once collected, she joined the skeleton of the former supervisor of the dead district and is working to make it a tourist attraction with the help of the undead residents. She uses a shovel as a weapon in order to keep the more unruly monsters in line. She is also highly interested in Glenn, more as a lover than a mate. ; :Glenn's sister from the east who suffers from Demonitis. She began sprouting horns from her forehead, which proves her family has more than just human blood in their ancestry, which lead her to overheating if she becomes flustered or overexerts herself until Glenn was able to help her.

He is also Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington. Hechter first became known for his research in comparative-historical analysis. His book Internal Colonialism: The Celtic Fringe in British National Development, 1536-1966 (1975; 1998) presented a social structural analysis of nationalism ‚Äì in contrast to then-popular cultural explanations of the phenomenon‚Äîand was one of the first such studies to employ multivariate statistical analysis. It was deemed one of the best books of the 20th century by the International Sociological Association. Subsequently, he began to deploy rational choice theory to explain a series of macrosociological problems, including nationalism, state formation, collective action and social order. These issues are analyzed in The Microfoundations of Macrosociology (1983), Principles of Group Solidarity (1987), Containing Nationalism (2000), Alien Rule (2013), Rational Choice Sociology (2019), and The Genesis of Rebellion (2020), co- authored with Steven Pfaff. A collection of his contributions in this vein can be found in Rational Choice Sociology (2019). Hechter is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 2004) and an elected member of the Society for Comparative Research. He was a fellow at the Russell Sage Foundation, and twice a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.  Early life and education  Hechter is the son of Oscar Hechter, a prominent steroid biochemist, and Gertrude Hechter, an artist. He was born in Los Angeles, California and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he attended the Putney School and graduated from Worcester Academy. He received an A.B in 1966 and a Ph.D. in Sociology in 1972, both from Columbia University.  Career  Hechter joined the Department of Sociology at the University of Washington in 1970, where he stayed until 1984. He then took a professorship at the University of Arizona where he remained for a full decade before moving to the joining the University of Oxford as a fellow of New College and a University Lecturer in Sociology From 1996 to 1999, Hechter returned to the United States and resumed teaching at the University of Arizona. In 1999, he rejoined the sociology department at the University of Washington, becoming Emeritus Professor in 2005. He then joined Arizona State University as a Foundation Professor in School of Global Studies, later becoming a Foundation Professor of Political Science in 2013 and a core faculty member of the Center for the Study of Social Dynamics and Complexity. From 2008 to 2009, he was the Director of School of Global Studies at ASU. He was also a Professor of Sociology at the University of Copenhagen from 2015 to 2017. Hechter currently serves on the editorial boards of Man and the Economy, Ethnopolitics, Nations and Nationalism and Legal Theory. Hechter has edited a number of special issues of journals on core sociological matters. \\"Internal Colonialism in Comparative Perspective\\", (with John Stone) appeared in Ethnic and Racial Studies in 1979. He produced an issue of Theory and Society in 1994 on \\"Theoretical Implications of the Demise of State Socialism\\" with Iv√°n Szel√©nyi. In 1995, he was in charge of a Special Issue of the American Journal of Sociology on \\"Prediction in the Social Sciences.\\" \\"Legitimacy in the Modern World,\\" came out in the American Behavioral Scientist (2009). \\"Center-Periphery Bargaining in an Age of Democracy,\\" (with David Siroky and Sean Mueller) appeared in the Swiss Political Science Review (2016).  Research and work  = Internal colonialism = Hechter‚Äôs first book, Internal Colonialism: the Celtic Fringe in British National Development 1536-1966, published in 1975, was selected as one of the Best Books of the Century by the International Sociological Association in 2000. An Italian translation was published in 1979. The book argued that colonialism was hardly limited to overseas colonies. Internal colonialism arose in many Western European countries in the course of state- building. England had conquered Wales in 1536, added Scotland with the Treaty of Union in 1707, and incorporated Ireland in 1801. The concept of internal colonialism was first used by Russian populists to describe the exploitation of peasants by urban classes. Subsequently, it was adopted by Antonio Gramsci and others to characterize the persisting underdevelopment of certain Russian and Italian regions. Internal Colonialism, however, limited the term to core states that extended their control over culturally distinct peripheries. The book presented two separate but related arguments. The first was couched at the level of regions. This argument holds that the lack of political sovereignty characteristic of internal colonies limited their economic welfare and threatened their cultural integrity. The peripheral population is denied the privilege and responsibility of determining its own political fate. The second argument focused on individuals rather than regions and asserts that culturally distinct identities remain salient among the members of groups subject to a cultural division of labor. = The cultural division of labor = His 1978 paper \\"Group formation and the cultural division of labor\\", published in the American Journal of Sociology, highlighted two primary types of group formation ‚Äì based on principles of hierarchy and segmentation‚Äîwith implications for social stratification in any society. This theme has recently been elaborated in a number of recent articles by political scientists on horizontal inequality, as well as Hechter‚Äôs co-authored 2016 article on \\"Ethnicity, Class and Civil War.\\" = Nationalism = Hechter‚Äôs work on nationalism addresses three questions: its timing, reasons for the political salience of cultural distinctions, and the consequences of alien rule. His 2000 book, Containing Nationalism explains why nationalist political movements only tended to arise since the 19th century. This is due to the recent increase in direct rule ‚Äî centralized political control ‚Äî in most advanced states. The rise of direct rule threatened traditional authorities in the peripheral regions of multicultural states; in response, they had good reason to mobilize their dependents under the flag of nationalism to challenge the legitimacy of core state rule. This book is translated into Simplified Chinese. In 2004, \\"From Class to Culture\\" in the American Journal of Sociology offered an explanation for the heightened importance of cultural politics in advanced societies. It argues that the growth of direct rule ‚Äì as indicated by the increasing centralization of state power and the development of policies promoting welfare expenditure and specific cultural policies‚Äîwith respect to immigration, same sex marriage, abortion, and so forth‚Äîtends to increase the salience of cultural politics at the expense of its class alternative. Alien Rule (2013) is about tensions that arise in societies when the ruling authorities are not themselves members of that collectivity, commonly giving rise to nationalist movements. The book describes the conditions that have made ‚Äì and might continue to make ‚Äì alien rule legitimate in the eyes of the ruled. It therefore explores the possibility that \\"good alien governance may be better than bad native governance\\", and will, if it is to succeed, be a question of whether it is able to \\"effectively produce the right kinds of collective goods, and allocate these goods fairly to the ruled\\". =Sociological rational choice theory = In the 1980s, Hechter‚Äôs interest in social theory led him to consider the wedding sociology with Rational Choice Theory. The first public airing of this work appeared in The Microfoundations of Macrosociology (1983). In 1987, Hechter wrote Principles of Group Solidarity, which argued that the solidarity of any group is determined by the conjunction of individuals‚Äô dependence on the group for access to collective goods, as well as the group‚Äôs capacity to monitor and sanction members for their compliance to corporate obligations. This volume was selected by Choice as an Outstanding Academic Book in 1988 and was a finalist for the American Sociological Association‚Äôs Distinguished Contribution to Scholarship Award. This book is also translated into Japanese. Beyond that, Hechter has written extensively on a variety of social phenomena. Rational Choice Sociology (2019) compiles some of his most important papers on theory, collective action and social order. = The value of children and grandchildren = Hechter‚Äôs interest in rational choice led him to consider the role of values and other motivational states in determining behavior. In this context, he wrote about the value of children and grandchildren. In 1994, he co-authored 'A theory of the value of children‚Äô in Demography. This article explores why people in advanced societies continue to have children even when the cost of so doing far exceeds their economic value to them. The argument hinges on the primacy of the behavioral assumption of uncertainty reduction. The authors review the inadequacies in the prevailing literature based on prevailing normative and rational choice explanations. The theory is explored from a number of angles including that of ‚Äòmarital solidarity enhancements‚Äô, and is related to the then-extant empirical literature. In a subsequent article, 'A Theory of the Value of Grandchildren' in Rationality and Society, published in 2008, the theme of uncertainty reduction is explored from a different angle. Since grandparents cannot know the length of their own life course, grandparents invest differentially in the children of those children who they deem most likely to support them in old age. Hechter‚Äôs engagement in value theory in general, and the measurement of values in particular, is shown in yet another paper, 'Prediction vs Explanation in the Measurement of Values' in the European Sociological Review, where rational action is explored from different measurement angles. In taking the role of values seriously as motivating factors in assessing social behavior, the authors construct a parallel factorial survey method to the more commonly used descriptive survey in value measurements. This method is based on an indirect form of measurement (factorial surveys) in that respondents have to make choices about a series of hypothetical vignettes, rather than responding to direct questions. = Collective action = In his 2020 book, The Genesis of Rebellion: Governance, Grievance and Mutiny in the Age of Sail, co-authored with Steven Pfaff, mutiny is analyzed as a manifestation of collective action and contentious politics. The book uses narrative evidence and statistical analysis to trace the processes by which governance failed, social order decayed, and Royal Navy seamen mobilized. The findings highlight the complexities of governance, showing that it was not mere deprivation, but how seamen interpreted that deprivation, which stoked the grievances that motivated rebellion. Using the Age of Sail as a lens to examine topics still relevant today - what motivates people to rebel against deprivation and poor governance, the book contributes to understanding the emergence of populism and rejection of the establishment.

Host Lulo or naranjilla (Solanum quitoense) is a perennial shrub whose fruit is an important input for production of fresh juice in Colombia, Ecuador, and other Latin American countries. Lulo is highly profitable for small-scale farmers and its production reached more than 3800 ha in Colombia in 2013 and 5000 ha in Ecuador in 2010. This crop has been considered as very promising for export markets since the 1970s but problems of low productivity and susceptibility to many diseases have limited its potential. Symptoms Diseased plants are easily distinguishable due to their flaccid and chlorotic appearance. Flaccidity and chlorosis start in the lower regions of the plant and progressively move upwards causing wilt of the entire plant. In later stages of disease development, progressive defoliation occurs, which is followed by necrosis in leaves. Discoloration of the vascular system is a characteristic symptom. Vascular discoloration, ring shaped brown coloration of the phloem, is visible as the vascular system becomes exposed following leaf and flower abscission in defoliation. Vascular discoloration is clearly observed when longitudinal or transverse cuts are made on the main roots, stems, leaf petioles, fruit peduncles, and fruits. Impact Vascular wilt has a huge impact on crop yield. Some regions in Ecuador can reach up to 80% in yield losses for Lulo production due to vascular wilt. This reduced yield is very problematic since many small communities depends economically mostly on this crop and resources for diseases management at these areas are not available,. But this disease not only has an economic impact, environmental problems also are derived from this problematic in the form of deforestation. Deforestation is often associated with Lulo cultivation because farmers generally abandoned the land once the disease shows and move to other areas that are pathogen free which are often natural forest areas. The lack of knowledge that this disease can be seed transmitted and combining it with the fact that moving to free- pathogen areas is a common practice to avoid disease leads to more deforestation. In Ecuador this deforestation is a major concern because the Amazon region, where most Lulo is produced, is considered a biodiversity ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù. Data collected in several commercial farms located at the Pastaza Province, Amazon region of Ecuador, determine that the incidence of this disease in a period between October 2017 and January 2018 was around of 17%, observing that the variety was the most susceptible. This problematic increases as time goes on due to the poor availability of information for farmers regarding management practices. Environment There are many factors that play an important role for the spread a Fusarium species in the fields. In the case of vascular wilt in Lulo there is two major factors that make this disease an epidemic problem in Ecuador and Colombia. Primarily this pathogen benefits from the combination of the cultural practices and from the fact that it is seed transmitted for spread itself. In Ecuador, Lulo seed is produced informally, farmers get their seeds from selected ripe fruits, and plants are produced in improvised seed beds near naranjilla plots. Since it is a seed- borne pathogen and because there is no initiative to produce a pathogen-free seed then is very easy to spread the disease and cause epidemics. Also, this pathogen as a species is a soil-borne pathogen which means that it can persist in the soil for many years. Another factor that benefits the presence vascular wilt in Lulo is the presence of the nematode Meloidogyne incognita which increases the plant's susceptibility to infection from F. oxysporum f. sp. quitoense probably due to lesions on the root surface. Management Primarily, the lack of management strategies is the main reason that this disease cause epidemics in Latin America. In Ecuador, the IPM CRSP began the development of management strategies for the control of this disease. The project pursued two management strategies: (1) use of pathogen-free seeds; and (2) development of naranjilla varieties with genetic resistance. The production of certified disease-free seed is not practical in naranjilla growing areas where producers are wide spread and access by seed suppliers is limited. Chemical control took place for disease control. Laboratory testing with chemical alternatives determined that the use of carbendazim in 2g/L of water provides a good control of the pathogen in the seed and was the most cost effective. An (INIAP) bulletin and other outreach materials were developed to help the information to be spread to the farmers. For the production of resistant varieties of Lulo, several accessions of the Lasiocarpa section genus Solanum were found to be resistant to F. oxysporum f. sp. quitoense. The development of the resistant varieties focused on the use of plant grafting. An experiment found that grafting common Lulo cultivar ‚Äúnanegalito‚Äù with the accession ECU-6242 of Solanum hirtum provided the best result for getting better yields. One interesting fact is that ECU-6242 is resistant to the root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) which also helps the disease to develop. In Nari√±o Department, Colombia, researchers have also found that grafting S. hirtum with S. quitoense is a good way to improve the plants resistance to infections of F. oxysporum without losing fruit quality.

A variation, Bleuda, Kueh Bleuda or Kue Bludder is also found in the Malacca Dutch Eurasian community and in Kochin, a city in the south-west of India. The mould used to bake the Breudher is typically a heavy brass or iron mould with deep groves with a tube in the centre, so that when the cake is baked, it comes out in a grooved ring shape with a central cylindrical hole. Each family has its own variation, but essentially the recipe for Breudher consists of butter, sugar, eggs, bread dough, milk, nutmeg and raisins/sultanas. The end product is a bread like cake with a slight yeasty taste. Breudher is traditionally served at Christmas breakfast, and New Years Day, cut into slices, spread with butter and topped with Dutch Edam cheese or fruit, such as green skinned bananas. The difference in the recipe between the Sri Lanka Dutch Burgher and the Malacca Dutch Eurasian community, is that the Malaccan version uses toddy (fermented sap from the flower of the coconut tree) instead of yeast. It is likely that toddy was used as a local substitute when yeast was difficult to source. In Kochin bakers use maida flour, ghee (instead of butter), candied orange peel, a blend of ground spices and serve it as a bread loaf. Traditionally the local Anglo-Indian community serve it as part of breakfast during a wake, seven days after a funeral. Origin Breudher is most likely to have originated from traditional Dutch breakfast cakes and breads, such as Ontbijtkoek or the German Kugelhupf. Singaporean food writer, Sylvia Tan, in Forgotten Foods and Mealtime Memories, published by the National Library Board believes that breudher is a derivate of \\"the Dutch word, brood-tulband, referring to the fluted turban-shaped mould used to make it\\". Brood-tulband literally translates to ‚Äòbread turban‚Äô, a description of its peculiar shape. The flute turban shaped Breudher cake, has all the ingredients which were commonly used in Dutch East Indies households: butter, sugar, eggs and spices. The main feature which makes the Breudher cake, particular is its usage of nutmeg, some spices and egg yolks. The Malacca Portuguese Eurasians claim it as originating from their community, which is said to be a traditional Malacca Portuguese cake. However there was a significant emigration of Ceylonese Burghers to Malacca in the early 1900s who brought with them their food and customs, assimilating into the local Eurasian community. It is generally concluded that \\"Breudher\\" originated from the Dutch and that the Portuguese \\"Blueda\\" is derived from the Dutch version.

The listing included a area with nine contributing buildings, a contributing structure and two contributing sites. The ranch was established in 1872 by Jane Ferris. It is located in the heart of the Ruby River valley. Ferris' application described an original c.1866 barn which still exists. Jane Ferris was a widow with two small children. She seems to have been the only woman in the Sheridan area who was successful in using preemption to secure land and a home, for herself and her heirs. The lower Ruby Valley was opened for settlement in 1863, soon after gold discoveries in Bannack and in Alder Gulch nearby, and before there was any government survey of the land which could have led to sale of the land to the public. By the 1841 Preemption Act, any 160-acre area of unsurveyed land was open for settlement, essentially by squatters who lived on the land for 14 months, by heads of households being either a man over age 21 or a widow. The property that she claimed included an 1866 cabin, which became a portion of the main residence, and an 1866 barn, and these were described by Ferris in her 1872 application for preemption. The property was farmed by her daughter and her family in the late 1870s and early 1880s. Later, the Frederick and George Hermsmeyer families further improved the property with additional buildings related to farming. Various owners held the property after World War I, then in 1937 the Fendon family took ownership. The Fentons brought the ranch back into prosperity and improved it, especially during and after World War II when agricultural prices were better. The ranch had stayed among Fenton descendants for 70 years when it was nominated for listing on the National Register in 2007, at which time it was owned in the Wuelfing last name. The ranch was deemed significant for its \\"association with women's history and the use of federal public land law for settlement in southwest Montana during the formation of Montana territory.\\" With References Category:Barns in Montana Category:Ranches in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Montana Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1866 ","title":"Ferris-Hermsmeyer-Fenton Ranch"},{"id":"62338393","text":"Hydrolea quadrivalvis is a species of flowering plant in the family Hydroleaceae that is known by the common name of waterpod.

Its focus is on point-of-sale transactions, debit orders, electronic funds transfers, and security of financial transactions ‚Äì particularly debit card security. Bank Zero joins other new banks in South Africa, such as TymeBank and Discovery Bank.  History  In January 2018, Bank Zero was founded by former First National Bank employees, Michael Jordaan and Yatin Narsai, and obtained a provisional banking license from the South African Reserve Bank. The bank's focus would be point-of-sale transactions, debit orders, electronic funds transfers, and financial service security. In October, after registering as a mutual bank in August, Bank Zero began trialing its services. As a mutual bank, customers who hold \\"specific cash investment products\\" will become shareholders in the bank. In March 2019, it announced that it began testing EFT payments and other services. Bank Zero had originally planned to soft launch some of its products at the end of 2019, but decided to delay its launch to 2020. In November, Bank Zero announced that it had patented a debit card with additional security features. Bank Zero uses IBM Z mainframe computers and LinuxONE, a secure platform which can protect against data breaches with IBM's Secure Service Container. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, Bank Zero stated that it still plans to launch in mid-2020.  Security  = Debit card = In November 2019, a patented debit card which, instead of storing the card number that is embossed on the card on both the magnetic stripe, and in the card chip, would have three different card numbers for each: the embossed number, the magnetic strip, and the card chip. This would allow Bank Zero to limit specific types of transactions to each card number. For example, the magnetic strip card number could only be used at an ATM and at a point-of-sale terminal; the card chip card number could only be used at point-of-sale devices; and, the card number embossed on the card could only be used for online transactions. The bank said, \\"[this] will dramatically minimise the negative impact of card data theft and card skimming.\\"  References  Category:Online banks Category:Banks of South Africa Category:Banks established in 2018 Category:Companies based in Johannesburg Category:South African companies established in 2018 ","title":"Bank Zero"},{"id":"62338422","text":"The 2018 Little Rock mayoral election took place on November 6 and December 4, 2018, to elect the Mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas.

The restaurants specializes in serving bubble tea, but also serve other entrees and snacks. Founded in 1983 as Yanghsien Tea Shop, Chun Shui Tang is one of two Taiwanese restaurant chains that claim to have invented bubble milk tea, the other being Hanlin Tea Room. Aside from restaurants, Chun Shui Tang also owns TP Tea, another chain of take-out stores that only sell bubble tea.  History  Chun Shui Tang was founded as Yangmu Tea Shop (ÈôΩÁæ®Ëå∂È§®) on May 20, 1983 by Han-chieh Liu (ÂäâÊº¢‰ªã) on Siwei Ave in Taichung. Fascinated by formalities of Chinese tea culture, Liu was very insistent on his decor and placed old paintings and burnt incense in his shop. In the summer months, hot tea doesn't sell as well, so Liu began experimenting with cold tea drinks using a cocktail shaker, which sold unexpectedly well. He was inspired to serve cold tea by a trip to Japan on which he saw coffee being served cold. The chain claims to have invented bubble milk tea in March 1987 when Hsiuhwei Lin (ÊûóÁßÄÊÖß) poured tapioca into a tea drink on a whim. In 2013, Chun Shui Tang established their first store outside Taiwan in Daikanyama, an upscale shopping district in Tokyo, Japan. Since then, more stores have opened in Japan, causing a boom in bubble tea's popularity in Japan. In 2018, Chun Shui Tang opened another store in Hong Kong's West Kowloon railway station. Till late 2020, Chun Shui Tang has already opened 8 branches in Hong Kong, including Causeway Bay and Mong Kok.  Menu  A cup of bubble tea in Chun Shui Tang. Chun Shui Tang specializes in bubble tea, but they also serve a wide variety of Taiwanese food, including gaifan dishes, beef noodle soup, lu wei, dougan, pig's blood cake, mochi, and more. It takes six months for a bar worker to learn to make the 80 or so drinks on the menu. Chun Shui Tang offers different seasonal products by time to time, e.g. Uji Matcha series, Herbal Jelly series etc.  TP Tea  TP Tea (short for Taiwan Professional Tea, ), formerly known as Tea Pa Tea, is a subsidiary of Chun Shui Tang. Similar to most bubble tea shops in Taiwan, TP Tea only sells bubble tea, though snacks are sold occasionally for a limited time. The chain was founded in 2005, and has since spread to China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States. The first TP Tea shop in Hong Kong was opened in 2016, which is located in Tin Hau. Until 2020, TP Tea has already opened 6 stores in Hong Kong.

Definition The trace is defined in the context of a symmetric monoidal category C, i.e., a category equipped with a suitable notion of a product \\\\otimes. (The notation reflects that the product is, in many cases, a kind of a tensor product.) An object X in such a category C is called dualizable if there is another object X^\\\\vee playing the r√¥le of a dual object of X. In this situation, the trace of a morphism f: X \\\\to X is defined as the compositition of the following morphisms: \\\\mathrm{tr}(f) : 1 \\\\to X \\\\otimes X^\\\\vee \\\\stackrel{f \\\\otimes id} \\\\to X \\\\otimes X^\\\\vee \\\\to 1 where 1 is the monoidal unit and the extremal morphisms are the coevaluation and evaluation, which are part of the definition of dualizable objects. The same definition applies, to great effect, also when C is a symmetric monoidal ‚àû-category. Examples If C is the category of vector spaces over a fixed field k, the dualizable objects are precisely the finite-dimensional vector spaces, and the trace in the sense above is the morphism :k \\\\to k which is the multiplication by the trace of the endomorphism f in the usual sense of linear algebra. In this sense, the categorical trace generalizes the linear-algebraic trace. If C is the ‚àû-category of chain complexes of modules (over a fixed commutative ring R), dualizable objects V in C are precisely the perfect complexes. The trace in this setting captures, for example, the Euler characteristic, which is the alternating sum of the ranks of its terms: :\\\\mathrm{tr}(id_V) = \\\\sum_i (-1)^i \\\\operatorname {rank} V_i.

He also created the makinori dying technique.  Biography  Moriguchi was born in Moriyama, Shiga prefecture on December 10, 1909. His given birth name was Heishichiro. He apprenticed with y≈´zen dyer Nakagawa Kason when he was 15. Moriguchi took the artist name \\"Kak≈ç\\" in 1934, when he was 25. He then opened his own studio in 1939. However, he struggled because of the anti-luxury measures that were implemented during World War II, and had to re-establish his studio in 1948. Moriguchi first exhibited at the Japanese Traditional Craft Exhibition (Nihon Dento Kogei ten) in 1955, where he won third place. He was named a Living National Treasure in 1967. In 1971 he was awarded the Japanese Medal of Honor (purple ribbon). He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun in 1982. Moriguchi died on February 20, 2008. His son, Kunihiko Moriguchi, continues his father's work as a y≈´zen kimono artist.  Style  Y≈´zen-dyed items are usually very colorful, but Moriguchi's works are not. His designs are classic, and seem like they were painted. His themes are usually inspired by the natural world, especially chrysanthemums. Moriguchi is best known for using the makinori (sprinkled rice paste) method of dying. This method involves sprinkling flakes of zinc-infused paste to fabric and then resist dying it. When the paste is removed it leaves a delicately spotted, mist-like pattern. This is actually a technique from the Edo period that was forgotten, but Moriguchi replicated the technique after he saw a kosode at the Tokyo National Museum. He originally thought that he could learn from a lacquer artist because they sprinkle gold fragments on some finished pieces, but he was unable to find a teacher. He instead replicated the makinori technique after much trial and error. Museums that hold Moriguchi's work include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Matthew returned to the UK, to pursue graduate studies in BA Humanities at the Nottingham Trent University and New York State University. Following his graduation and a number of management positions in the UK, Matthew was posted to India in 1996, as the Chief Operating Officer of the travel group Cox & Kings Ltd. During his time at Cox & Kings, Matthew played rugby for the Indian national team and was awarded international rugby caps for India and playing in the World Cup Qualifiers in 2001. He spent much of his spare time practicing rugby at the Bombay Gymkhana. Outside his club, he observed a group of boys, hanging around its premises, watching the game with interest. He invited them into the club and began coaching them. In 1999, Matthew founded Magic Bus with a group of street and slum-dwelling children from Mumbai. It was an opportunity for these children to engage in sports as a momentary relief from their day-to-day challenges. In 2001, Matthew resigned his job at Cox & Kings to focus full time on Magic Bus. He teamed up with an NGO named Akanksha with the intention of providing children a weekend break away from the difficulties of their everyday lives. Every fortnight he hired a bus taking the rugby boys to mentor younger children from local NGOs, to a hill station or the beach. The children started calling this the Magic Bus.

At that time, it consisted of 8 engine companies, 3 hose companies, and 1 hook and ladder company.

That same day, J√≥hannes Stef√°nsson, the former general manager of Samherji in Namibia and a whistleblower working with anti-corruption authorities in Namibia, and other countries, stated on the investigative TV-program Kveikur on R√öV that Samherji's CEO and biggest shareholder, √ûorsteinn M√°r Baldvinsson, authorized the bribe payments. The scandal also reached Norway when it was revealed that its biggest bank, Den Norske Bank, was involved in the transfer of money used in the alleged bribes. On 15 November 2019, Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ published a story about an email exchange between the general manager of S√≠ldarvinnslan hf., Gunn√æ√≥r Ingvason, and Samherji employees, A√∞alsteinn Helgason, J√≥hannes Stef√°nsson and an unidentified third man. Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ stated that Gunn√æ√≥r asked for advice on behalf of Henrik Leth, the chairman of Polar Seafood, the largest private fish industry company in Greenland, on conning fishing quota out of authorities in Greenland and pointed to their experience in Namibia. At that time, S√≠ldarvinnslan and Polar Seafood owned together the East Greenland Codfish company. Both Gunn√æ√≥r and Leth stated that the email had been taken out of context and pointed out that the full transcript clearly states that a third party had voiced interest in building a fish factory in Ammasalik on the east coast of Greenland, something they believed was only a ploy to obtain fishing quota from the government. They further stated that the purpose of the email was to obtain information on the potential cost of such buildup, as Samherji had done similar buildup in Africa, to see if it was feasible. Reactions In response to the allegations, Samherji published a statement on 12 November where J√≥hannes Stef√°nsson, the whistleblower and former general manager of the Namibia operation, was accused of solely being behind the alleged bribes and that other high ranking staff members were unaware of his actions. Although J√≥hannes did admit to being part of the bribe sceme, further records showed that he never had control of the companies bank accounts in Cyprus, where the money flowed through, and that the alleged bribes continued for three years after he left the company.

Before being promoted to an Associate Professor of Economics at New York University Stern School of Business. She left New York University in 2015, after spending 15 years teaching there. During this time, she was also employed at the Hoover Institution National Fellow located within Stanford University from 2010-2011 and the Kenen Fellow within the Department of Economics at Princeton University from 2006-2007. = Current career = She is on the New York University Stern Committees since 2007, with responsibilities including financial oversight, obtaining tenure, and teaching at Ph.D. programs. Veldkamp obtained a National Bureau of Economic Research faculty research fellow in 2008, and a research fellow at Center for Economic and Policy Research since 2009. In 2011, she became a coordinator for the Economic Fluctuations, Growth, and Development research group in the New York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business. In 2014, she joined the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Macro Annual Editorial Board. Then in 2016, she joined the Board of Editors at the American Economic Journal in the Microeconomics division. She most recently joined the Monetary Policy Advisory Panel in the New York Federal Reserve. She currently teaches at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business as a Professor of Finance and serves as a co-editor of the Journal of Economic Theory.  Research  Veldkamp's research varies from macroeconomics, monetary economics, international finance, and asset pricing. It focuses on how individuals, investors, and firms obtain information, and how that information influences their decisions, and how those decisions change the macroeconomy and financial markets. Some of her other work investigates how women choose to participate in the labor force, and how women observe influences that contribute to employment patterns that reflects the \\"geographic patterns of female labor force participation in the United States\\". She also explores how research for investments are done by mutual fund managers. = Publications = Veldkamp has published multiple works in outlets such as The American Economic Review, The Review of Economic Studies, The Journal of Finance, Journal of Economic Theory, and the Journal of Monetary Economics. A collaboration on the paper \\"Leadership, Coordination and Corporate Culture\\" with economists Patrick Bolton from Columbia University and Markus K. Brunnermeier from Princeton University, was awarded the 2008 JP Morgan Price for the best paper at the Utah Winter Finance Conference. It was then printed in the Review of Economic Studies on April 2013, in volume 80(2), from pages 512-537. It was regarding the role of leaders in large organizations, in which a model of leadership was proposed to help manage corporate culture in large organizations, coordinate followers' actions over time, and help to steer an organization when faced with changing environments. Veldkamp also collaborated with economist Vasiliki Skreta from New York University on the paper \\"Ratings Shopping and Asset Complexity: A Theory of Ratings Inflation\\", which was awarded 3rd place by the Glucksman Institute Research Prize. It was also published in the Journal of Monetary Economics on July 2009, in volume 56(5), from pages 678-695. The paper regards the emergence of rating bias, and how more competition in the ratings market can continuously distort ratings, as well as how investors can no longer use past data to detect rating bias. An economic model was introduced to help explain the situation. A key assumption of the model was that investors were unaware of the rise of asset complexity and were also creating ratings bias. Veldkamp's most awarded paper was \\"Information Immobility and the Home Bias Puzzle\\", written in collaboration with economist Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh. It was awarded 1st place by the Glucksman Institute Research Prize, and was also awarded the best paper prize in investments by the Financial Management Association. It was published in The Journal of Finance on June 2009, in volume 63(3), from pages 1187-1215. The paper studies the criticism regarding information-based models of the home bias and attempts to answer the question \\"If home investors have less information about foreign stocks, why don't they choose to acquire foreign information, reduce their uncertainty about foreign payoffs, and undo their portfolio bias?\\" The study shows a model of investors deciding which risky asset payoff to study. It then dives into the world of asymmetric information, where investors pursue the incentive to purposefully learn and obtain information that others do not know. Showing that investors choose to have different information than other investors. Veldkamp is the author of the textbook Information Choice in Macroeconomics and Finance, printed by the Princeton University Press. The textbook highlights how information choice can be used to answer questions regarding \\"monetary economics, portfolio choice theory, business cycle theory, international finance, asset pricing, and other areas.\\" It also covers how information friction can be used to build and test applied theory models, and includes recent research topics such as \\"rational inattention, information markets, and strategic games with heterogeneous information.\\"  References  Category:Living people Category:1975 births Category:Stanford Graduate School of Business alumni Category:Columbia University faculty Category:21st-century American economists Category:American women economists Category:New York University Stern School of Business faculty Category:Northwestern University alumni ","title":"Laura Veldkamp"},{"id":"62341620","text":"Tr·∫ßn Tu·∫•n Minh (born 21 October 1997) is a Vietnamese chess Grandmaster (GM) (2017), two-times Vietnamese Chess Championships winner (2017, 2018).

Her main research interests lay in respiratory physiology and carbon monoxide poisoning. Early life and education Killick was born on 3 May 1902 in Ilford to Arthur Killick and Henrietta Fanny (n√©e Moulton). She attended Leeds Girls' High School and went on to study at the University of Leeds, earning a BSc with honours in physiology followed by an MB ChB in 1929. She later received an MSc (1937) and DSc (1952) from Leeds. Career Killick worked in the physiology department of the University of Leeds from 1929 to 1931, as an investigator to the Safety in Mines Research Board. During this period she studied carbon monoxide poisoning and acclimatisation, and collaborated with John Scott Haldane from the University of Birmingham. In 1935, she was appointed lecturer in industrial medicine at the University of Birmingham. Killick moved to London in 1939 with an appointment as lecturer in applied physiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. In 1941, she was appointed to the Sophia Jex-Blake chair of physiology London School of Medicine for Women (renamed the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in 1947), where she spent the remainder of her career. She held a visiting professorship at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1953. Killick sat on numerous committees, including the Medical Research Council's industrial research board, the National Coal Board's physiological panel, the European Coal and Steel Community's committee on medical research on carbon monoxide poisoning, and the Physiological Society committee. She was a member of numerous boards for the University of London, and oversaw the establishment of the pre-clinical departments of the university's overseas colleges, University College Ibadan (now the University of Ibadan) and University College of the West Indies (now the University of the West Indies). =Research= Killick began investigating respiratory physiology and carbon monoxide poisoning in her first role at Leeds, and this was her primary research interest throughout the rest of her career. In Birmingham, she conducted a series of experiments in which she \\"gassed herself for science\\" (as reported by the Birmingham Gazette in 1941) by exposing herself to carbon monoxide in a sealed box at weekly intervals, causing herself to become hypoxic and sometimes lose consciousness. She did, however, demonstrate acclimatisation over time, with her symptoms and blood carbon monoxide levels decreasing with successive sessions over a period of many months. She reported her findings in articles published in 1936 and 1948. She was the first to show that humans and mice acclimatise to carbon monoxide differently due to differences in the respiratory epithelium. Later in her career, she investigated treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning, using different gases to ventilate dogs that were unconscious due to excess carbon monoxide; she showed that a mix of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide was more effective than air or pure oxygen. Personal life Killick married Arthur St George Huggett, a physiologist, in 1938. They had two daughters, Margaret (b. 1940) and Jean (b. 1945). She died in London's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery on 31 May 1960, aged 58, from a cerebral haemorrhage.

He was one of the spreaders of Islam in the late 15th century in the Majapahit Kingdom. He is the son-in-law of Sunan Ampel, although some say he is the father-in-law of Raden Paku, who is better known as Sunan Giri. He is estimated to have lived during the Sunan Ampel period of 1400-1481 M. He had a daughter named Dewi Wardah. His tomb is directly behind Taman Bungkul Surabaya.  Folk Tales  One of the tales circulating about Sunun Bungkul revolves marrying off his child but could not find the right man for the marriage. He then organized a contest to find a match. Whoever could pick from the pomegranate tree growing in his garden would wed his daughter, Dewi Wardah. Many men tried but none succeeded in picking a pomegranate from the tree, some even dying in the process. One day, Raden Paku, who is also known as Sunan Giri, walked through Sunan Bungkul's garden. As he arrived at the pomegranate tree, a pomegranate fell from the tree. Raden Paku took it and handed it to Sunan Ampel, his teacher at the pesantren. Sunan Ampel said to Raden Paku, \\"Blessed are you, because soon you will be the in-law of Ki Ageng Supo through an arranged marriage with his daughter, Dewi Wardah\\". Raden Paku responded with confusion as he was supposed to be married to the daughter of Kanjeng Sunan. Raden Paku then explained Ki Ageng Supo's contest and stated that it must be Raden Paku's destiny to have two wives, Dewi Wardah and Dewi Murtosiah. Another tale tells a different version wherein Ki Ageng Supo accidentally picked a pomegranate and it washed away in the river Kalimas. The pomegranate flowed north until it reached the Ngemplak split, where the river is divided into two. The left branched towards Ujung and the right flowing into the Pegirikan river. The pomegranate floated and drifted towards the right. One morning, a santri of Sunan Ampel found the pomegranate while taking a bath in the river and handed it over to Sunan Ampel. The following day, Ki Ageng Supo traced the riverbanks and located the place where many students were bathing in the river. He was certain that this was where the pomegranate was found by one of his students. When asking if anyone found a pomegranate, Raden Paku confessed he was the one who found it, and was subsequently married to Dewi Wardah.

Life  Diethelm's father, Jakob von Wartensee, was chief bailiff of Rorschach. His mother was Apollonia von Syrgenstein. Diethelm went to the Latin school in Lindau. He is mentioned as conventual at the Abbey of Saint Gall in 1523. Since 1528, he held the office of governor of Rorschach. On 19 September 1530, he was elected abbot at the Abbey of Wettingen-Mehrerau. He received the papal confirmation from Clement VII on 22 May 1531. Before that (on 10 October 1530), Emperor Charles V had already accorded him the prerogatives. After Diethelm had assured himself of the support of the five catholic towns of the Confederancy in Zug, he let himself be paid homage by his subjects in Wil on 12 December 1531 and a few days later also at L√∂mmenschwil and Gossau. He received the consecration from Auxiliary bishop Melchior Fattlin on 28 April 1532.  Works  By means of the contract of Wil in 1538, Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee succeeded in reintroducing Toggenburg into the dominion of the Abbey of Saint Gall. As prince abbot, he was confronted with the so- called putsch of Rorschach in 1559 which was directed against the rights of serfdom of the abbey. In churchly matters, he strove for the renewal of Catholicism and for the restitution of monastic jurisdiction rights. Furthermore, he was severe on the Anabaptists among his subjects. On 28 February 1532, the city of Saint Gall restituted the abbey and guaranteed the Catholics free practice of religion in the defined monastery district. During Diethelm's term of office, the number of conventuals steadily increased. In 1555, St. John Abbey in the Thur Valley was also incorporated by the Abbey of Saint Gall due to a papal decision. Abbot Diethelm proved to be a zealous promoter of catholic scholarliness. On 6 June 1551, he laid the foundation for the new library building at the Abbey of Saint Gall. He sent several of his conventuals to Dillingen to study, and later on also to Paris. Endeavouring to renew the religious life, he ordered the return of the relics of Saint Othmar to Saint Gall, as they had been brought to Einsiedeln Abbey during the reformation riots. Moreover, Diethelm appointed conventuals of Saint Gall as reform abbots atWettingen Abbey (Peter Eichhorn) and Fischingen Abbey (Markus Schenkli). Probably due to his endeavours regarding the Catholic reform, he received invitations to the Council of Trent in 1543 and 1551, which, however, he did not obey.

The attack occurred on 24 June 1967, in the early hours of the traditional festival of the Night of San Juan which is a winter solstice festival in the Southern hemisphere. The army was acting under the orders of the president of Bolivia, General Ren√© Barrientos Ortu√±o. Background Ren√© Barrientos Ortu√±o considered that the start of a new guerrilla resistance to his dictatorship was brewing among the mining communities, inspired by Che Guevara's small force which was operating in Bolivia at the time. The ambush was planned to crush any attempt to organise resistance among the miners.

At around 5 in the morning the soldiers poured out of the train carriages and descended on the assembled mass, attacking with machine guns and dynamite. The electricity had been cut shortly before the attack, so the local radio station La Voz del Minero (the Voice of the Miner) was unable to warn the miners or spread the news to the outside world. The soldiers shot men, women and children at close range. Many of the miners and families were either asleep or intoxicated after the all night festivities and the sound of the initial shots and explosions were confused with the traditional firecrackers of the celebration. The bulk of the victims were in the encampment called La Salvadora around the Canca√±iri railway station. Under the conditions of dictatorship, media reporting of the massacre was severely limited and no official investigation followed. La Patria newspaper reported that: Initial estimates of casualties were of 20 dead and 72 wounded.

The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season one stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his new wife Krystle; Pamela Sue Martin as Blake's headstrong daughter Fallon; Al Corley as Blake's earnest son Steven; John James as playboy Jeff Colby; Wayne Northrop as Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane; Bo Hopkins as Denver‚ÄìCarrington geologist Matthew Blaisdel; Pamela Bellwood as Matthew's troubled wife Claudia; Katy Kurtzman as Matthew and Claudia's teenage daughter Lindsay Blaisdel; and Dale Robertson as wildcatter Walter Lankershim. Notable recurring performers include Lee Bergere as Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders, and Lloyd Bochner as Jeff's uncle, Cecil Colby. Development Aaron Spelling, already well known for his successful ABC series, including Starsky and Hutch, Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Vega$ and Hart to Hart, took on Richard and Esther Shapiro's vision of a rich and powerful family who \\"lived and sinned\\" in a 48-room Denver mansion. Esther Shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was I, Claudius, a fictionalized depiction of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Roman emperors. Shapiro said in 1985, \\"We wanted to do something that would be fun, an American fantasy. We thought people had seen enough stories where families fell apart. We wanted a strong, nineteenth- century sort of family where people were in conflict but loved each other in spite of everything.\\" Intended by ABC to be a competitor for CBS's Dallas, the working title for Dynasty was Oil. In early drafts of the pilot script, the two main families featured in the series were known as the Parkhursts and Corbys; by the time production began, they had been renamed the Carringtons and Colbys. George Peppard was cast as series patriarch Blake Carrington, but ultimately had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role, and was quickly replaced with John Forsythe. Filmed in 1980, the pilot was among many delayed due to a strike precipitated by animosity between the television networks and the partnership of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Dynasty finally premiered on ABC as a three-hour event on January 12, 1981. The first season was ranked #28 in the United States. Esther Shapiro later said in the DVD commentary of the first season, \\"The audience told us almost immediately: All they wanted to do was be in the mansion. [They] couldn't care less about the oil fields. They didn't want to see grubby rooms.\\" Plot As Dynasty begins, powerful oil tycoon Blake Carrington is about to marry the younger Krystle Jennings, his former secretary. Beautiful, earnest, and new to Blake's world, Krystle finds a hostile reception in the Carrington household‚Äîthe staff patronizes her, and Blake's headstrong and promiscuous daughter Fallon resents her. Though devoted to Krystle, Blake himself is too preoccupied with his company, Denver- Carrington, and blind to Krystle's predicament. Her only ally is her stepson Steven, whose complicated relationship with Blake stems from their fundamental political differences and Steven's resistance to step into his role as future leader of the Carrington empire. Meanwhile, Fallon, better suited to follow in Blake's footsteps, is (as a woman) underestimated by and considered little more than a trophy to her father. She channels her energies into toying with various male suitors, including the Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane. At the end of the three-hour premiere episode \\"Oil\\", Steven finally confronts his father, criticizing Blake's capitalistic values and seemingly amoral business practices. Blake explodes, revealing the secret of which Steven thought his father was unaware: Blake is disgusted by Steven's homosexuality, and his refusal to \\"conform\\" sets father and son at odds for some time. In counterpoint to the Carringtons are the Blaisdels; Denver-Carrington geologist Matthew‚Äîunhappily married to the emotionally fragile Claudia‚Äîis Krystle's ex- lover. Returning from an extended assignment in the Middle East, Matthew quits and goes into business with wildcatter Walter Lankershim. As Blake's behavior begins pushing Krystle toward Matthew, the men are set as both business and romantic rivals. Blake is further enraged when Steven goes to work for longtime friend Matthew, in whom Steven sees qualities lacking in Blake. Though previously in a relationship with another man, Steven finds himself drawn to Claudia, who is putting her life back together after spending time in a psychiatric hospital. Fallon makes a secret business deal with Blake's old friend and more-powerful business rival Cecil Colby, marrying his nephew Jeff to secure Cecil's financial assistance for her father. When Blake stumbles upon Steven in an innocent goodbye embrace with his former lover Ted Dinard (Mark Withers), Blake angrily pushes the two men apart; Ted falls backward and hits his head, the injury proving fatal. Blake is arrested and charged with murder, and an angry Steven testifies that Ted's death had been the result of malicious intent. A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears in the season finale \\"The Testimony\\", and Fallon gasps in recognition: \\"Oh my God, that's my mother!\\"  Cast  = Main = * John Forsythe as Blake Carrington * Linda Evans as Krystle Carrington * Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon Carrington * Pamela Bellwood as Claudia Blaisdel * Al Corley as Steven Carrington * John James as Jeff Colby * Wayne Northrop as Michael Culhane * Katy Kurtzman as Lindsay Blaisdel * Dale Robertson as Walter Lankershim * Bo Hopkins as Matthew Blaisdel = Recurring = * Lloyd Bochner as Cecil Colby * Peter Mark Richman as Andrew Laird * Lee Bergere as Joseph Anders * Mark Withers as Ted Dinard * Brian Dennehy as Jake Dunham  Episodes  Reception The first season of Dynasty was \\"modestly popular\\" among viewers, ranking #28 in the United States with a 19.0 Nielsen rating, while #1 series Dallas achieved a 31.8 rating that season.

A shadowier figure, William Walker Atkinson (Yogi Ramacharaka) translated yoga texts into Russian, but they were all burnt during the Russian Revolution of 1917, and yoga, especially yoga teaching, was forbidden in the USSR. =Stanislavski's system= Constantin Stanislavski used several elements of yoga in his system for training actors. The Russian actor and trainer Constantin Stanislavski developed a system for training actors significantly influenced by yoga and Indian philosophy. He saw how beneficial yoga was for his students and used it extensively in the Second Studio (founded 1916), in the Opera Studio (1918-1922), and in the Moscow Arts Theatre, where his 1919-1920 notebooks describe the use of Hatha Yoga alongside Swedish gymnastics, rhythm exercises, and voice training. In the Opera Studio he spoke of \\"the laws of correct breathing, the correct position of the body, concentration and watchful discrimination\\"; the scholar William H. Wegner glosses these as pranayama, asana, and dharana respectively. which cites Stanislavski was thus, note the scholars Dorinda Hulton and Maria Kapsali, making use of traditional yoga, not its modern posture-based form, which had not yet been created. =Indra Devi= The yoga pioneer Indra Devi, born in the Russian Empire, escaped to the West during the Russian Revolution and studied yoga under Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. She helped to make yoga popular as exercise in America, especially amongst women, and in 1960 visited the USSR, seeing St Petersburg (then Leningrad) for the first time in 40 years, and meeting the government ministers Andrei Gromyko and Alexei Kosygin at the Indian ambassador's reception at the Sovetskaya Hotel. An authorised English version of the article is available on the Wild Yogi website. Yoga as exercise A woman practising Janusirsasana in a Moscow park, 2010 Yoga has become increasingly popular in Russia since the 1980s, particularly in major cities, mainly due to its reputation for health benefits. B. K. S. Iyengar twice visited the country, leading to the establishment of some fifty Iyengar Yoga studios, the best-known of them in the Old Arbat district of Moscow. 2nd International Yoga Day, Vladivostok, 2016 In 1991, the managing editor of Yoga Journal, Linda Cogozzo, noted that Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost had allowed yoga to be practised openly. She recorded that in 1986 Arkadiy Greenblatt had been put in prison for three years for teaching yoga, but in 1990 an American delegation, including such luminaries as Judith Lasater, Amrit Desai and Lilias Folan, had been allowed to visit Russia and share knowledge of yoga. It also mentioned two men, Yuri Nicolaiovich Polkovnikov and Genadiy Gregorievich Stasenko, who \\"took the risk\\" of teaching yoga in Russian gymnasiums in the 1960s, describing it as \\"gymnastics or health therapy\\". Russia's first school of yoga was founded in Moscow in 1993 by Viktor Sergeyevich Boyko; it has expanded to have branches around Russia. Yoga steadily increased in popularity; in 2007, the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, stated that \\"little by little, I'm mastering yoga\\". By 2015, yoga was ubiquitous, with a class in every gym and new yoga studios in every town. The president, Vladimir Putin, met the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi at the BRICS summit that year, and promised to try yoga alongside his other sporting activities. In 2018, two entrepreneurs who made their money in knitting, Mikhail Galaev and Dmitry Demin, founded Prana, a yoga business in Moscow with 23 practice rooms, said to be the largest in Europe. Yoga styles available in Russia have expanded to include new forms such as Aerial Yoga (with hammocks) and Jivamukti Yoga. The Russian yoga teacher Nina Mel, who created \\"N-Code Yoga Practice\\", was featured as Yoga Magazines teacher of the month in 2019. Russian yoga teacher Nina Mel in Kukkutasana (Rooster pose) Russia's relationship with yoga has remained uneasy, however; in 2015, officials in Nizhnevartovsk closed yoga classes as \\"religious cults\\"; in 2017, the yoga teacher Dmitry Ugay was charged with \\"illegal missionary activity\\" under an anti-terrorism law; and in 2019 the Russian member of parliament Yelena Mizulina stated that yoga could \\"turn people gay\\".

His area of research spans from animal wildlife genetics to the management of captive populations and livestock breeds to animal biobanking. After earning his B.Sc. from the University of Portsmouth and his PhD from the University of Leicester, Bruford worked at the Zoological Society of London where he became Head of Conservation Genetics before joining Cardiff University as reader in 1999 and professor in 2001. In addition to his research activities at Cardiff University, he is also director of the Frozen Ark project, which seeks to preserve threatened animal species by means of cryopreservation.  Education and career  Bruford was born to Ann and Colin Bruford in 1963. After graduating from St Cyres Comprehensive School in 1981, he pursued and earned a B.Sc. (Hons) in biomolecular science from the University of Portsmouth in 1984. He then joined the University of Leicester for his PhD research under the supervision of Terry Burke on minisatellite markers in the genome of the domestic chicken. Bruford's PhD thesis, titled Hypervariable markers in the chicken genome, was submitted in 1992. In 1990, he joined the Zoological Society of London's conservation genetics group as a research associate, becoming its acting head in 1993 and finally its head in 1994. Bruford held the latter position until 1999, when he took on the position of a reader in the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University. Two years later, in 2001, he became a professor at Cardiff University. He became co-chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission‚Ä≤s Conservation Genetics Specialist Group in 2014 (alongside Gernot Segelbacher). Initially a trustee, Bruford has been director of the Frozen Ark project since 2015; the same year he became co-director (to Terry Marsden) of the Sustainable Places Institute in Cardiff. In 2019 he became Dean for Environmental Sustainability at Cardiff University. Over his career, Bruford has also served as editor for several journals in conservation biology and genetics; from 2012 to 2016, he was editor-in-chief for Heredity. He has been part of the IUCN Conservation Breeding Specialist Group since 1993.  Research topics  Trained as a molecular biologist, Michael Bruford established links to behavioural ecology and conservation biology early on in his work. One of his first publications together with Terry Burke and Nick Davies seeks to link insights from bird genetics to their mating and breeding behaviour in dunnocks. Since the early 1990s, Bruford has made contributions to conservation biology by exploring population genetics of wild, captive and domestic animals. Recently, he has also sought to advance the field of biobanking of animal DNA, tissue and germlines for conservation purposes in the United Kingdom and beyond. Aside from his role as director of the Frozen Ark, a charity which seeks to support animal cryobanks and develop best practise procedures, Bruford is currently principal investigator in the BBSRC-funded project \\"CryoArks\\", which aims at establishing a national UK cryobank network. Michael Bruford has received a number of awards for his work. In 2003, he was awarded the Scientific Medal of the Zoological Society of London. The Learned Society of Wales elected him as a fellow in 2010. From 2012 to 2016, he held a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award.  Publications  Bruford is (co-)author of more than 300 scientific publications in journals and edited volumes. Together with Giorgio Bertorelle, Heidi Hauffe, Annapaolo Rizzoli and Cristiano Vernesi, he edited the handbook Population Genetics for Animal Conservation (2009).

Life He was born at Waddon in Surrey, the son of Samuel Bernard, formerly vicar of Croydon, and his wife, Elizabeth; the physician Francis Bernard was his brother. In 1670 he was apprenticed to the surgeon Henry Boone. Bernard, a Tory and High Churchman, was elected surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1686, by special command of the king. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1696. He was the chief surgical practitioner in London of his time, noted for saving the leg of a young Benjamin Hoadly, later to become Bishop of Winchester, from amputation. He became sergeant-surgeon to Queen Anne in the first year of her reign. Bernard died at Longleat on 9 October 1710, where he was treating Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth. He was a bibliophile, and his library was auctioned on 22 March 1711. Family Bernard in 1679 married Susanna Gardner, and they had a son and three daughters. Of the daughters, Elizabeth married Ambrose Dickins, apprentice to Bernard who became a physician and FRS, and another married William Wagstaffe.

In January 1900 he was elected to the French senate, representing the Finist√®re d√©partement. His senatorial career was brief, however, since he died slightly less than a year later. Biography =Personal= Ars√®ne Mathurin Louis Marie Lambert was born at four in the morning in Carhaix (Finist√®re) in the far north-west of France. He was baptised in the town at the church of Saint Tr√©meur the next day. His mother, born Jos√©phine Maillet, is identified as the owner of a piece of land at Saint-Joseph on the island d√©partement of R√©union, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. His father, Jean Fran√ßois Herv√© Lambert, served as an army officer, and it was presumably as a result of the engineering skills he acquired in the army that he was subsequently appointed to a position as \\"conducteur des Ponts et Chauss√©es\\", involved in bridge and road construction and maintenance. Ars√®ne Lambert also decided on a military career at a relatively young age. There was nevertheless another side to him. He was deeply interested in the arts and literature. He displayed talents as an artist and sculptor. In his later years he also wrote histories of the wars in which he had participated. He married, on 11 May 1870, Isabelle Eug√©nie Jos√©phine Delisle, a French woman of Cuban provenance. =Professional= \\"Scramble for Africa\\" Lambert graduated from the Saint Cyr military academy, then at Yvelines near Paris, in 1856 and enlisted with the \\"Infanterie de marine\\" (loosely, \\"Marines\\"). The regiment was at that time enged in the conquest of Senegal where he arrived in February 1858 and where it is reported that he distinguished himself. He was still only twenty-five when he was awarded his first medal. Between February and June he was mandated to \\"take control\\" of the hilly Fouta Djallon region in land from what was becoming the French colony of Rivi√®res du Sud (subsequently French Guinea).Lambert Ars√®ne, ¬´ Voyage dans le Fouta-Djalon c√¥tes occidentales d‚ÄôAfrique (f√©vrier-juin 1860) ¬ª, Revue maritime et coloniale, 1861, n¬∞2, pp. 1-51. He was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1862. There followed a six year posting to R√©union between 19 May 1863 and 28 August 1869, where he was stationed at Saint-Denis as a captain of the marines (\\"capitaine d'infanterie de marine\\". He was involved in containing the riots that erupted at Saint- Denis in 1868. In 1869 he was promoted again, becoming a battalion commander. Almost immediately after that he became deputy chief of staff, assigned to General √âlie de Vassoigne, with the 12th infantry regiment. Franco- Prussian war Back in Europe, responding to a characteristically devious provocation from Chancellor Bismarck, the French parliament voted to declare war against Prussia on 19 July 1870. Lambert's unit found itself close to Sedan where the French commander Marshal de MacMahon had decided to concentrate military resources in order to block an anticipated Prussian military advance through Belgium. By this time Lambert was serving with the 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (\\"2e R√©giment d'Infanterie de Marine\\") which formed part of the so-called Blue Division which in a series of savage engagements during the wider Battle of Sedan captured and then recaptured Bazeilles from I Royal Bavarian Corps under the command of General von der Thann. With a handful of men Lambert was given the task of organising the defence of the Rougerie Inn which had become a key focus of the fighting and which later became a little museum known as the House of the Last Cartridge (\\"Maison de la derni√®re cartouche\\"). The little force put up an obstinate resistance lasting several hours. Captain Ars√®ne Lambert homself had the honour of firing the final cartridge before the defenders were forced to surrender. The Bavarian commander was so impressed by the courage shown by the defenders that he spared their lives, despite allowing a massacre by his troops of the local population whose support for the French forces enraged the German forces. Lambert was taken prisoner but managed to escape. He managed to escape and reconnect with the French army. He was with the army that on 21 May 1871 entered Paris and regained control from the revolutionary communards who had taken over the city, in the chaos following the four month Prussian army siege, on 18 March 1871. Ars√®ne Lambert succeeded in taking control of several strategically important locations including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building, the parliament building (\\"Corps l√©gislatif (Second Empire)\\") and the Gare d'Orl√©ans, which was the Paris rail terminus for trains to Tours. (The provisional French government had decamped to Tours in September/October 1870 during the first part of the Siege of Paris. In recognition of his contributions he was appointed an officer of the Legion of Honour, the award being announced on 10 June 1871. The award ceremony took place on 14 September 1871: the honour was physically handed over by his former military commander, who had already, in May of the previous year, attended and signed off at Lambert's marriage as a witness. Third republic Despite the immediate recognition of Ars√®ne Lambert's heroic contributions during the Franco- Prussian War and the rapid termination of the commune experiment, the French Third Republic was born out of military defeat. For the military establishment that was little to celebrate, which may explain why within the army further promotion came slowly for Ars√®ne Lambert. He was made a full colonel only in 1885. Five years later, and having become known as a committed supporter of the Republican establishment despite having spent the first part of his career serving the Empire, he became a Brigadier general (g√©n√©ral de brigade) at the end of 1888 (or, according to some sources, during 1890) and, in around 1890, \\"commandant militaire du S√©nat\\". By 1892 (when he was a witness at a marriage) he was giving his domicile as Quimper, where he was given charge of an infantry brigade (\\"130e r√©giment d‚Äôinfanterie de ligne\\"). Despite a developing arms race among the principal military powers of Europe and continuing colonising activity, both in Africa and further afield, on the home front the 1890s was essentially a decade of peace, coupled with social and economic progress. In 1896, by now aged 62, Ars√®ne Lambert was released from active military service. Within the Legion of Honour his retirement was marked, on 22 June 1896, by a promotion to the rank of \\"Grand Officier\\". He was elected to the presidency of two veterans associations, the \\"Soci√©t√© nationale des v√©t√©rans de terre et de mer\\" and the \\"Union des soci√©t√©s r√©gimentaires\\". On 28 January 1900 Ars√®ne Lambert was elected to the senate in succession to Corentin Hall√©guen, the previous senator for Finist√®re, who had died the previous year. He sat with the democratic left (\\"Gauche d√©mocratique\\" group in the chamber. Slightly counter-intuitively, he nevertheless took a full part in discussions concerning the organisation of troops in the colonies, insisting that colonial defence was something that should be left to the Ministry for War. His enduring concern with matters military were also evident in a question he addressed to the newly installed minister for war concerning celebrations to mark the centenary of the death of Th√©ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, a favourite soldier of Emperor Napol√©on I. Ars√®ne Lambert died on 11 January 1901.

As head of the EAD, she has overseen the successful breeding of captive Scimitar-horned oryx in Abu Dhabi and reintroducing them back into the wilderness, thus seeing a species that was listed as Extinct in the Wild now increase its numbers in their natural habitat. Al Mubarak currently serves several executive roles in various environmental organisations in the UAE and is a public spokesperson for environmental and conservation issues in the UAE. Early life and background Al Mubarak was born in 1979 in Abu Dhabi. She is the daughter of Khalifa Ahmed Abdulaziz Al-Mubarak, a former UAE ambassador to France who was assassinated in 1984 in Paris by the Abu Nidal Organization terrorist group and Sameera Al Khamis. Al Mubarak's grandfather was the Ahmed Abdulaziz Hamad Al-Mubarak, former judge and chairperson of the Shari'a Judicial Department in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Al Mubarak has three siblings: Rasha; Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Managing Director of Mubadala Investment Company; and Mohamed Khalifa Al-Mubarak, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority. Al Mubarak holds an MSc in Public Understanding of Environmental Change from the University College London, UK and a BA (Hons) in Environmental Studies and International Relations from Tufts University, Massachusetts, in the United States. Al Mubarak is married to Badr Jafar, a prominent Emirati business executive and social entrepreneur. Environmental work The EAD has played a key role in reintroducing the Scimitar horned oryx into the wild in Chad. Pictured here is one of the first calves born in the wild after almost two decades. In 2001, Al Mubarak helped establish Emirates Nature-WWF (EN-WWF)--a UAE affiliate of the WWF. She is currently its Managing Director. In 2008, she became the founding Managing Director of the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (MBZ Fund) ‚Äì a UAE-based philanthropy supporting direct species conservation worldwide. Since its inception in 2008 to November 2019, the MBZ Fund has supported more than 2,041 projects in 150 different countries benefiting 1,341 different species and subspecies and made a significant impact on species conservation globally. Al Mubarak is currently the Managing Director of the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD). Employing over 1,000 people, the EAD is a government agency responsible for environmental regulation, conservation and promotion of sustainable development in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. Appointed in 2011, she was the first woman to serve as Secretary General and was promoted to its Board of Directors in 2018 by the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Under Al Mubarak, the EAD played a key role to reintroduce the Scimitar-horned oryx into the wild in Chad. In 2000, the Scimitar-horned Oryx was officially declared Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List. Beginning in 2016, efforts by the EAD together with the Sahara Conservation Fund, Zoological Society of London, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, and the Government of Chad have successfully released 200 oryx that were bred in Abu Dhabi into the wild in Chad. In 2017, the reintroduction effort reported a number of successes including the first calves born in the wild in decades. Along with the Scimitar-horned oryx, the EAD has also undertaken a successful captive breeding programme and reintroduction efforts to reintroduce the Arabian oryx back into the wild. The Arabian oryx has moved from \\"Endangered\\" to the less- serious category of \\"Vulnerable\\" in the latest Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In an interview with UK's The Guardian newspaper Al Mubarak has mentioned: > To have brought the Arabian oryx back from the brink of extinction is a > major feat and a true conservation success story, one which we hope will be > repeated many times over for other threatened species.

Kies worked as a public school teacher for three years before going against the traditional gender norms of her time and completing an M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Over the duration of her 30-year career at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, Kies researched nutritional biochemistry. She demonstrated relationships between minerals, proteins, and dietary fiber through pioneering human subject research. Her findings led to advancements in human knowledge of copper and protein metabolism. She was honored with the Borden Award and was a fellow of the American College of Nutrition. Kies was a feminist and a member of the National Organization for Women and the Women's Equity Action League. She died of uterine cancer three months after her diagnosis.  Early life and education  Kies was born on December 13, 1934 in Blue River, Wisconsin. Her mother had been an educator and her father was superintendent of the school system. As a child, her family, including Kies and her three sisters, Cosette, Camilla, and Carolyn moved to a farm in Platteville, Wisconsin. She was the valedictorian at her graduation from Platteville High School. Kies attended Wisconsin State College, Platteville, where she earned a Regents Fellowship and other academic honors. In 1955, she completed a B.S. in English with minors in history, geography, library science, and home economics. After graduation, Kies worked as a public school teacher for three years. During this period, Kies determined that she had become an educator because of traditional gender norms. Kies saved money for graduate school and studied human physiology while she continued teaching. She earned an M.S. in foods and nutrition in 1960 and a Ph.D. in human nutrition and medical physiology in 1963 from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Her master's thesis was titled \\"Studies in Urinary Nitrogen Excretion\\". Kies' dissertation was titled \\"Effect of Essential to Non-essential Amino Acid Relationships in Adult Man and in the Rat\\". As a graduate researcher, Kies worked in the laboratories of Hellen Linkswiler and May Reynolds in the department of home economics. She was a research assistant tasked with managing the nutrition program's \\"diet squads\\" of research participants in metabolic studies. She also worked as a part-time dietitian at the Wisconsin General Hospital. Her research focused on nonspecific nitrogen including nonessential amino acids, excess essential amino acids, and nonprotein sources including urea and diammonium citrate.  Career  After completing her doctorate, Kies joined the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln (UNL) in 1963 as an assistant professor in the department of food and nutrition. She was promoted to associate professor in 1965 and full professor in 1968. She would remain at Lincoln for the remainder of her 30-year career. Her investigations focused on nutritional biochemistry. Throughout her career, Kies was a prolific writer. In 1965, she published her first paper in the Journal of Nutrition. Kies published thirteen papers in that journal. Her work can be found in other journals including The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Federation Proceedings and the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. She wrote over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles and authored books and chapters about minerals and plant proteins. Kies organized national iron, calcium, and copper-related conferences. She later edited monographs of these conferences. Kies reported in 1974 that she spent 70% of her time researching at the UNL Experiment Station with the rest of her time devoted to teaching nutrition courses. She also participated in women's issues, serving as coordinator of the UNL class on \\"Women in Contemporary Society.\\" In 1974, she was the advisor for the UNL Women's Resource Center and the University Women's Action Group. Kies identified as a feminist and was a member of the National Organization for Women and the Women's Equity Action League. In her experience, she witnessed more discrimination against women in academia and research than in the commercial sector. She found that a large issue in addressing these problems lay in difficulties changing unconscious discrimination. Kies also believed that women in home economics are not always taken as seriously by academics in other disciplines due to gender bias. Kies became a well-known researcher who attended numerous domestic and international conferences. In 1987, Kies received a distinguished visiting faculty award from the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China through which she worked with the Ministry and the Department of Food Hygiene at Shandong University. In China, she taught the methodology of conducting human metabolic studies. Kies recruited several Chinese students to pursue their education in the United States. Kies was a member of the American Institute of Nutrition, the American Dietetic Association, the Institute of Food Technologists, the American Oil Chemists' Society, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and the Society for Nutrition Education. She was a certified home economist and a registered dietitian. During her career at Lincoln, served as the major professor for approximately 173 M.S. students and 32 Ph.D. students. Kies continued advising students after her August 1993 uterine cancer diagnosis. = Research = Kies' early research was in amino acids and nitrogen excretion. Kies' advancements in the understanding of protein metabolism stemmed from her pioneering use of human subjects to research nutrients and their interactions through controlled feeding studies. In these studies, research participants lived in university live-in facilities alongside nonparticipants. In exchange for housing, American and international students participated in feeding studies that involved controlled diets and the collection of urine and stool samples. Her research found that the essential amino acid and mineral requirements did not vary by race, ethnicity or sex. Conversely, Kies found that plasma lipoproteins and lipids varied among races with Asian women having higher values. The controlled feeding studies cost $10,000 per participant and were funded by the Nebraska University Agricultural Experiment Station and the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Kies conducted five to six of these studies a year. In 1973, Kies' work in the agronomy program entailed testing the nutritional value of new lines of wheat developed by plant breeders. The UNL food and nutrition department chair Hazel Metz Fox remarked that Kies was a \\"creative researcher\\" who was adept in both basic and applied research. Kies' research focus explored human nutritional requirements and the nutritional value of processed foods. Their study found that butanediol and urea are potentially valuable nutritional additives for humans based on their lack of demonstrated toxicity, low cost, and availability. Kies investigated the nutritional needs of children with Fox. Focusing on preschool-aged children, they studied the urine levels of creatinine, nitrogen, thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and niacin. They also compared differences between low and high-income children. In 1974, Kies' research interest included human nutrient requirements and how nutrients interact with each other, and awareness of and attitudes toward nutrition in different communities. With Fox, Kies researched the nutrition knowledge and attitudes of farmers and wheat and beef producers in Nebraska. By 1987, she had investigated the nutrition of meat and cereal products for ten years. From 1983 to 1987, Kies focused on trace minerals such as manganese. Her research suggested that many Americans, especially women, did not consume enough manganese. Kies' findings corroborated those of biologist Paul Saltman. Both Kies and Saltman's research suggested that manganese- deficient diets resulted in progressively weaker bones in both animals and humans. In 1989, Kies led a study on human nutrition in bottle-fed, breast-fed diabetic, and breast-fed non-diabetic babies. The department was specifically analyzing the manganese, potassium, and sodium levels in diabetic and non- diabetic mothers and their infants. This involved collecting nearly 2,000 dirty diapers a day. This \\"dirty diaper\\" study first began at the University of Nebraska Omaha but later moved to the East Campus at UNL. Kies researched nitrogen balance and the use of urea as a nitrogen source for ruminants. Her research revealed that urea could be effectively used in human metabolism to maintain a nitrogen balance. She found that protein quantity was just as important as protein quality. Kies and Fox demonstrated that increases in low- quality protein foods can support nutritional requirements of human adults. Kies shifted from researching nonspecific nitrogen to internutrient metabolism. She was most interested in the relationships between minerals, dietary fiber, and fat. Her laboratory examined hemicellulose, cellulose, and pectin. They found that hemicellulose increased the levels of zinc, copper, and magnesium in fecal excretions. She also found that supplementing hemicellulose improved urinary excretion of vitamin C. Kies discovered that pectin and zinc decreased urinary excretion of vitamin C. Her later research explored the relationship between dietary fat and mineral absorption. She observed correlations between the absorption rate of iron, zinc, and manganese and decreased intake of dietary cholesterol and fat. She found that consuming dietary fiber reduced total and LDL-cholesterol. Kies found that calcium supplements increased copper absorption while magnesium, selenium, and potassium decreased it. Kies demonstrated that phytates, tannins, and dietary fiber inhibited dietary copper utilization.  Personal life  Kies was interested in Inuit and Native American weaving, carving, sculpture, and pottery because she was intrigued by pieces she could touch. She was also a fan of reading and classical music. Kies died of uterine cancer in Lincoln, Nebraska, on November 30, 1993, at the age of 59. She was cremated and her ashes were placed in her family's plot in Platteville, Wisconsin. Kies was survived by her sisters. Services were held at the home economics auditorium on UNL's East Campus.  Awards and honors  Kies received the Borden Award and $1,000 from the American Home Economics Association in 1973 in recognition of her research in the field of nutrition and experimental foods. She was honored with the University of Wisconsin-Platteville's alumni award in 1974. In 1983, Kies won the Outstanding Research Award from Ross Laboratories. In 1986, she received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Chemical Society. She became a fellow of the American College of Nutrition in 1989. Also in 1989, she received the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln Distinguished Faculty Scholar Award from the College of Home Economics. She was nominated for the Outstanding Faculty Teaching Award by the College of Home Economics in 1989, 1990, and 1991.

Initially, her professional focus was in the field of Middle Eastern Archaeology. Her dissertation, ‚ÄúMoveable Property in the Nuzi Documents,\\" was described as a \\"classic\\" in her field. Cross's research was based on an analysis of the transactions of two well-off families in the region in second millennium B.C. Through translating family records, business transactions, and court proceedings on cuneiform tablets, Cross was able to examine measuring systems as well as the different values of various goods during the time. Specifically, Cross examined the relative values of produce, clothing, metals, and metrology, among others. It is important to note that Cross published all of her professional works under her maiden name of Cross but was later known at Hunter College as Professor Jensen.  Influence in field of Middle Eastern archaeology  In addition to publishing her dissertation, Cross also contributed to the field of Middle Eastern archaeology throughout her time in graduate school and after receiving her Ph.D. From 1930-38, Cross served as assistant curator at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. Cross also served as registrar on the Tell Billa and Tepe Gawra excavations in Iraq under Professor Ephraim A. Speiser. Based on this research, Cross published \\"The Pottery of Tepe Gawra,\\" which detailed the changes in pottery with regards to shape, decoration, and wares. Cross' chapter became a model for later studies of Middle Eastern pottery, as Cross pioneered the first research on the subject.  Influence in field of New Jersey anthropology and prehistory  After returning to the United States, Cross changed the focus of her research to New Jersey prehistory, specifically with regards to the Indians of the Delaware Valley. Cross initially became involved with the New Jersey State Museum, where she spearheaded public education efforts such as the publication of leaflets and lay articles about New Jersey's history. In 1936, Cross was appointed as supervisor of the Indian Site Survey of New Jersey, a Works Project Administration project that was part of the New Deal. This project consisted of retelling New Jersey's history, and Cross was in charge of the project's budget of $250,000. Using the data from this project, Cross published a two-volume book entitled Archaeology of New Jersey. Volume I consisted of descriptions of sites across New Jersey and a compilation of data that resulted from previous uneven explorations. Volume II analyzed the history of the controversial historical site Abbott Farm. In this volume, Cross concluded that Paleo-Indians traversed the site but full occupation began with the Archaic period. Cross later published a 95-page work entitled ‚ÄúNew Jersey‚Äôs Indians,\\" which was intended for a lay audience. From 1959-1967, Cross was appointed supervisor of the Tocks Island Reservoir Area excavations for the National Park Service. A lifelong member of the New Jersey State Museum, Cross was involved in the museum for 43 years and was appointed to various positions, including State Archaeologist.  Professorship and teaching  Cross began her teaching career at the summer school at Rutgers University. In 1929, she became a charter member of Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology, and she was made an honorary member of the Archaeological Society of New Jersey in 1937. By 1939, she simultaneously was an archaeologist for the New Jersey State Museum as well as an instructor at Hunter College. Due to lack of funds, Cross taught a variety of courses at Hunter College, where she was known as Professor Jensen. From 1950-1957, Cross served as Divisional Chairwoman of the Department of Anthropology, and after 28 years of teaching became a full professor. She had a reputation for being honest and inquisitive among her students at Hunter. From 1940-1960, Cross also served as Program Chairwoman of the Eastern States Archaeological Federation.  Final years and death  Cross never retired, despite suffering from a host of health issues including low blood pressure and emphysema. She spent her final years in frustration as the New Jersey State Museum shifted its focus to modern art, leaving behind much of her work on the natural history of New Jersey. Cross died at age 65 of pneumonia in 1972.

The daughter of parents who were water skiers and who operate a swimming pool business, she competed in the sport from the age of 13. Teelow entered events across the globe and won the 2013 Waterski Racing World Championship in the Formula 2 category. Teelow was killed from an atlanto- occipital dislocation she sustained in an accident during the 2013 Bridge to Bridge Water Ski Classic. Personal life Teelow was born in the Wellington Hospital in Wellington, New South Wales on 22 January 1993 to Tania (n√©e Williams) and Chris Teelow; both of her parents competed in water skiing events and her mother is a two-time world champion. The family operates a swimming pool business in Wellington and reside in the town. Teelow has a younger brother, Jarrod. She was taught at the St Mary's Catholic School in Wellington and completed her education at the St Johns College in Dubbo. Teelow took part in athletics events for the Wellington Little Athletics club. At the time of her death, she was enrolled on a bachelor of science human movement course at the University of Technology Sydney. Career Aged 13, Teelow began competing in water skiing events. She learnt to ski on the Burrendong Dam in 2007. Teelow was named the Australian and Australian Capital Territory Junior Skier of the Year for 2008 and the New South Wales Junior Skier of the Year. She secured qualification to the 2009 Waterski Racing World Championships in Belgium at the national selection rounds in Lake Charm. Teelow prepared for the competition by broadening her experience on rough waters with ski sessions in Botany Bay and Port Jackson. She came fourth and fifth overall in the concluding two rounds for a final finish of fourth-place overall. Thereafter, Teelow made appearances in competitions across the world, in such countries as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. She participated the Catalina Ski Race, the Grafton Bridge to Bridge, and the Bridge to Bridge events in 2011. Teelow sustained a broken ankle during an event in 2012 and she spent time recuperating. In September 2013, she won the Formula 2 category of that year's World Waterski Racing Championships in the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands. According to Teelow's father, she planned to progress to the Formula 1/Opens class as the next step of her career. Death On the morning of 24 November 2013, she partook in the Bridge to Bridge Water Ski Classic on the Hawkesbury River to the north of Sydney. Soon after the race had commenced, which was held on calm waters and with a negated wind, Teelow passed under the Hawkesbury River railway bridge at around before her driver slowed and an observer raised his left arm to inform her of incoming minor waves. Teelow hit the first wave without incident until her ski was observed to launch airborne ahead of her approximately into the race. She flipped and cartwheeled along the water; her ski helmet detached from the first contact with the water. Teelow had contusions in the upper part of her thoracic and the lower part of her cervical vertebrae; she went into cardiac arrest and the emergency services resuscitated her upon being moved to another slipway. She was transported by helicopter to the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney a \\"critical condition\\". Teelow was placed on life support before she was declared dead from her injuries at approximately 17:55 local time. She was the seventh water skier in Australia to die from injuries sustained over the past five years. A subsequent limited autopsy determined Teelow died from an atlanto-occipital dislocation that caused blunt force head and neck injuries due to her striking water at high speed. On the afternoon on 8 December, a memorial to celebrate Teelow's life was held in her memory at the Hunstanton Ski Club. Her death was investigated by the New South Wales Police Force and the Roads and Maritime Services with co-operation from Ski Racing Australia; the police prepared a report for the New South Wales coroner. The results of the investigation into Teelow's death were published on 31 May 2018. According to the report, it was unable to determine where the wave that Teelow struck originated from and whether the ski she used contributed to her accident. The report found her helmet was not a contributing factor to her death. The New South Wales deputy state coroner Teresa O'Sullivan recommended Ski Racing Australia develop technical specifications for ski helmets and flotation devices to suit water skiers and inspect and secure safety equipment before the start of races. She also called for the governing body and the Roads and Maritime Services to consider adopting speed restrictions in the Formula 2 category. Personality and legacy Teelow was described by her friends as a \\"champion on and off the water\\" and her former school co-ordinator called her \\"a beautiful girl with such a joyous smile\\". According to her father, she saved the lives of six individuals through the donation of her organs. The 2014 Bridge to Bridge Water Ski Classic was allowed to commence as scheduled by organisers and was converted into a memorial in Teelow's honour.

She worked for over several decades in conservation at the Institute and was also a significant influence in the early years of archaeologically-themed television programmes.  Education  Ione Gedye attended Francis Holland School, Graham Terrace between 1918 and 1925. Gedye was a student of Flinders Petrie, and studied classical archaeology at University College, London.The Calendar for the year 1931-1932, University of London, pp. 299, 502 She volunteered to clean items from one of Petrie's excavations for a summer exhibition. Gedye worked at the Verulamium excavations with Tessa Verney Wheeler and Kathleen Kenyon. Wheeler had her clean metalwork from the excavations and encouraged her interest in artefacts. Whilst studying at the University of London, Gedye also rowed for her university on the same team as Eleanor Gait.  Career  Gedye (right) and Delia Parker working in the Technical Department at St John's Lodge. Gedye was one of the original staff members in the technical department at the Institute of Archaeology, which opened in 1937. She was the founder of the Repair Department, which was initially housed in a former operating theatre. There was no formal training programme in conservation in the 1930s, and Gedye conducted experiments to inform her work. She also learned about restoring and cleaning artefacts from people such as Harold Plenderleith at the British Museum Research Laboratory and from staff at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels. During the war, she worked on reconstructions of Pleistocene mammals. Gedye taught conservation from 1937 to 1975. After World War II, she headed a conservation course that became increasingly attractive to students, and gradually expanded from a one-year certificate to become a three-year degree course. In the late 1950s, Gedye was joined in her work by Henry W. M. Hodges who helped her to develop the training course. Early broadcasts of archaeological digs by the BBC were informed by Gedye's work, as well as that of Margot Eates and Delia Parker. This work educated the public and contributed to the professionalisation of archaeology in the UK. Gedye retired in July 1975.  Death and legacy  Gedye died in 1990. The UCL Institute of Archaeology awards an Ione Gedye Award each year for the best conservation-based dissertation. This prize was created when Gedye requested that her colleagues create a prize for students rather than buy her a retirement gift. Gedye's portrait hangs in the Institute.

His disclosures and eyewitness accounts revealed that Rhode Island children in state care were shuffled from night-to-night shelters, denied an education, and routinely placed in treatment facilities that violated state and federal laws both in Rhode Island and out-of-state. At the age of 15, after his legislative advocacy and news coverage of the abuse he suffered, Alahverdian was sent to facilities in Nebraska and then to Florida where he was tortured and raped. The Florida and Nebraska homes were subsequently shut down after Alahverdian, as an adult and a lobbyist, exposed the abuse and called for reform once again. Alahverdian later attended Harvard University. Alahverdian had also managed political campaigns, written op-eds for The Providence Journal, and had cameo roles in Brotherhood and Underdog. In early 2020, NBC 10 News, WPRI News, ABC 6 News, and WPRO News revealed that Alahverdian was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Associated Press and other news agencies confirmed that Alahverdian died on February 29, 2020, of the illness which had spread to his kidneys and lungs.  Early life and political beginnings  In April 2002, Alahverdian attended a special hearing of the Cranston City Council and addressed over 900 taxpayers upset over a threat of state control of the city's financial department and budget deficits. Alahverdian noted that the first-term mayor John O'Leary was being blamed for the city deficit, and not the past mayoral administrations. In an interview published in The Providence Journal, reporter Mark Arsenault wrote that Alahverdian said \\"We have a great City Council and I oppose a state takeover\\" and that Mayor O‚ÄôLeary cared deeply for the community. Arsenault went on to say that Alahverdian \\"was unfazed by the crowd's rough reception.\\" He said, \\"I stand up for what I feel. As did everyone.\\" Alahverdian was offered jobs with the city and the state following his speaking up at the City Council meeting where he was publicly supported by Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island AFL‚ÄìCIO President George Nee and others. After a short time lobbying for increased state aid to local schools, Alahverdian was ultimately hired by Reps. Gordon Fox, Bea Lanzi, Joanne Giannini, and David Cicilline (who later went on to become a congressman) as a page and then as a legislative aide. Shortly after the start of his employment at the Rhode Island State House, Alahverdian became an orphan after his mother had a nervous breakdown. He was placed in shelters and group homes in what was called the DCYF \\"night-to-night\\" program. This scenario gave Alahverdian, who, by age 14, was simultaneously a Rhode Island House of Representatives page, legislative aide, and DCYF orphan, the ability to tell lawmakers about the abusive and negligent occurrences in the DCYF night-to-night program. In Rhode Island, at the time, the standard practice for the night-to-night program was to be transferred from the DCYF building during the day to a shelter where the child would spend the night. During his stays in these facilities, Alahverdian was abused and neglected by employees and other clients present in the shelters. Since he was still a state employee working with members of the Rhode Island General Assembly, he was able to inform lawmakers of the attacks when he reported for work at the Rhode Island State House. Due to the legislators finally having the opportunity to get the facts from Alahverdian, the Rhode Island House of Representatives read and passed a resolution that requested \\"that the Department of Children, Youth and Families present a plan to the General Assembly on or before May 1, 2002 which will eliminate night to night placement in Fiscal Year 2002.\\" In 2003, Alahverdian resigned his position as a legislative aide and became a full-time lobbyist to advocate for DCYF reform and continue his whistleblowing efforts. A state representative approached Family Court Chief Judge Jeremiah S. Jeremiah and offered to adopt Alahverdian. This was revealed in a September 2012 interview when a former state representative called in to The Buddy Cianci Show on Newstalk 630 WPRO and reported that he was one of the lawmakers who witnessed the abuse in the shelters and offered to adopt Alahverdian. He said he saw Alahverdian testify before multiple legislative committees and commissions on DCYF issues. None of the legislators or inquiring members of the press were told that Alahverdian had been sent to Nebraska and then on to Florida. Alahverdian was prohibited from having any contact with the outside world. Both the Nebraska and Florida placements were closed by their respective states for significant abuse before, during, and after Alahverdian was admitted. Alahverdian explained in interviews that he was sent out of state because his political activity, lobbying, and media appearances from 2002 until early 2003 made him a publicity threat. He said in a 2011 Providence Journal interview that \\"The problem here was, I was consistently informative, a source of information on DCYF.\\" Being sent from Rhode Island to Nebraska and then to Florida where Alahverdian knew no one, with both facilities having questionable records of care, worked to prevent him from speaking with the legislators, the media, lawyers, or the courts. The torture and rapes continued until Alahverdian was released \\"beyond recognition and ability to function\\" due to Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. A DCYF spokesperson confirmed that the agency had stopped using the Florida facility where Alahverdian was raped, remarking in an interview that \\"There were concerns we had with the way they were treating our kids.\\" Providence Journal columnist Bob Kerr wrote of Alahverdian's time in the night-to-night program as such: \\"He was put in night-to-night placement by the Department of Children, Youth and Families, a practice so hideously abusive and stifling that it would seem better fit to a Charles Dickens novel than to 21st century Rhode Island.\\" Kerr also wrote that \\"[Alahverdian] has always suspected that he was sent out of state because he was so outspoken about the horrors of night-to-night placement. He had been a page and an aide at the Rhode Island State House before his exile, and he was not reluctant to point out the hard lessons learned from his DCYF experience.\\"  Work as a lobbyist  Along with Pawtucket Police Captain and State Rep. and current East Providence Mayor Bob DaSilva and other legislators, Alahverdian had a press conference in March 2011 to reveal an unprecedented bipartisan legislative plan to spark reform at DCYF. In a statement to the press issued by the Rhode Island House of Representatives Legislative Press Office, Representative DaSilva said: Rep. DaSilva's bill would have kept Rhode Island children in Rhode Island group homes as opposed to sending them far from home. National political truth researchers PolitiFact cited Alahverdian's battle with the DCYF and wrote an article claiming that Rep. DaSilva's claim that the DCYF was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars was \\"mostly true\\"‚Äîbecause the state had actually been spending millions on out-of-state placements. DaSilva said he was moved by Alahverdian's story. The article went on to say Alahverdian was also responsible for other legislation. During several legislative sessions in the 2010s, he worked with legislators in both the House and Senate to propose a resolution creating an emergency oversight commission on DCYF that would give lawmakers the opportunity to identify problematic practices and potential solutions within the agency. In 2011, Alahverdian drafted a bill introduced by Rep. Michael Marcello that would guarantee the constitutional rights of children and adolescents in DCYF care. Alahverdian told NBC News that he was \\"subjected to torture, beatings, and assault\\" in Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Florida. He also explained that he was refused to contact anyone at all, including the courts, his social worker, or his lawyer until his 18th birthday. During a news conference, he said \\"These facilities are dangerous. My question to Rhode Island: Why are we paying for them?\\". Among other causes, he promoted the passage of social justice legislation. Alahverdian fused abuse data and budget analyses with his own experience in DCYF custody to inform the Rhode Island legislature of what taxpayers were funding. Alahverdian lobbied for DCYF reform while attending Harvard full-time, often supplanting extra-curricular activities with traveling to Providence to testify at hearings at the Rhode Island State House. DaSilva's bill banned the use of treatment facilities outside the state of Rhode Island unless the Family Court made a finding that the services could not be offered in Rhode Island. As recent as the 2000s, Rhode Island was removing children from their families at twice the national average. Alahverdian testified against Governor Lincoln Chafee's selection for the Office of Child Advocate, Regina Gibb, for being a former DCYF employee. Before the Senate committee Alahverdian explained that if she felt strongly about preventing child abuse and protecting children, she would have started doing so at DCYF. In a 2011 Associated Press article about children in Rhode Island DCYF care by AP investigative reporter David Klepper, Alahverdian disclosed that Rhode Island had been spending millions of dollars on sending children out of Rhode Island. Alahverdian reported that he was not allowed to contact anyone while in the Florida and Nebraska care homes, including the courts, the police, his social worker, Rhode Island legislators, or anyone else that could help him escape the torture. During a hearing on legislation pertaining to former Family Court Chief Judge Jeremiah, Alahverdian successfully persuaded the House Judiciary Committee to consider the abuse and negligence that occurred under Judge Jeremiah's reign and refuse his request. The bill, if passed, would have given the emeritus Family Court Chief a special ‚Äúemeritus judge license plate.\\" Alahverdian, quoted in The Providence Journal, stated it was \\"against the best interests of the state.\\" The bill ultimately failed and Jeremiah never received the special license plate Rep. Bob DaSilva introduced the bill to bar out-of-state placements once again in 2012. In April 2012, longtime Providence Journal columnist Bob Kerr remarked that ‚Äúregardless of what happens in federal court or at the State House, Alahverdian has left his mark. Night-to-night placement has been ended forever. And Manatee Palms, the Florida facility where Alahverdian experienced so much abuse, is no longer used by DCYF. Alahverdian, I have to believe, had something to do with those changes.‚Äù  Lawsuit  Alahverdian featured on the cover of The Newport Daily News Alahverdian sued the DCYF, former Rhode Island governor Donald Carcieri, the states of Nebraska, and Florida, the group homes, and others because of the part they allegedly played in allowing the documented abuse in the Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Florida treatment centers to go on without investigation. When Alahverdian attempted to enter a state courthouse to obtain documents for his federal lawsuit, he was prevented from accessing the court clerk's office and allegedly assaulted by a courthouse deputy. According to CBS News affiliate WPRI, a witness stated, \\"I saw the officer‚Äôs elbow and forearm pull back and then quickly thrust forward causing him (Alahverdian) to cry out.\\" The Boston Globe reported that U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell called the first hearing with the parties in the case in June 2011. In December 2011, Judge McConnell held another hearing where The Providence Journal reported that Alahverdian said: \\"America can‚Äôt be America unless the requirements of a state law called the Children‚Äôs Bill of Rights are met and individual freedom and independence prevail.\\" WPRI and The Providence Journal reported that Alahverdian was supported by two State Representatives, Doreen Costa and Michael Chippendale, when the State of Rhode Island sent Alahverdian a bill for $207,000.00 for medical care he received while in DCYF care. The Executive Office for Health and Human Services sent Alahverdian through his attorney a letter claiming Alahverdian owed the state money if a settlement agreement with the state defendants was reached. Costa and Chippendale held a press conference to express their anger with the DCYF and support for Alahverdian. Costa and Chippendale also announced legislative initiatives to prevent what happened to Alahverdian from happening to others in similar situations in the future. In October 2012, Alahverdian gave an interview to the Rhode Island PBS Viewpoint program where he was joined by musician, journalist, and advocate Rudy Cheeks of The Providence Phoenix. Cheeks compared Alahverdian's living under the DCYF care system to living in the Soviet Union because Alahverdian was unable to speak out, obtain a formal education, or contact the state legislators for whom he once worked while he was sent to Nebraska and Florida. Aside from the civil case, to date only a handful of the employees who tortured and raped Alahverdian were prosecuted. Most notably is a worker from the Florida facility who admitted to sexual battery and was sentenced to prison.  Aftermath  In May 2011, State Rep. Rene Menard introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives honoring Alahverdian for \\"fighting for the rights and privileges of children and adolescents in state care\\", being \\"an outspoken advocate for abandoned, abused, and neglected children\\", and doing his utmost for the \\"protection of rights for youth in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\\" Following several incidents of DCYF abuse as reported in 2013, columnists from The Providence Phoenix asserted that those in power in Rhode Island listen to Nicholas Alahverdian and his legislative ideas so that DCYF abuse and deaths can be prevented. In August 2013, the federal case was settled. Settlement details with the private corporations that own the facilities were not disclosed. Alahverdian had discussed the Trust set up by the federal court in an interview with WPRO News reporter Steve Klamkin. CBS News affiliate WPRI 12 reported that The Nicholas Edward Alahverdian Trust was approved by Judge John J. McConnell and that an abuse hotline, academic scholarship, and drop-in center will be established in his name. WPRI also reported that Alahverdian settled with the state in exchange for the state waiving a $206,918 lien against him for medical care he received while in state care. On February 12, 2015, the legislation prohibiting out of state placements was reintroduced in the Rhode Island Senate at the initiative of Alahverdian. In April 2017, Alahverdian was a guest columnist in The Providence Journal, America's oldest continuously published daily newspaper, where he called for an auditing of unnecessary expenditures, an increase in frontline staff, and investing in state-of-the-art case management software. Also in April 2017, Alahverdian was invited to testify before the House of Representatives Finance Committee on DCYF finances, management practices, and staffing deficits. In October 2018 during the 2018 Rhode Island gubernatorial election, Alahverdian called for incumbent Governor Gina Raimondo to withdraw from the race. Raimondo, according to Alahverdian and substantiated by multiple news reports concerning child fatalities and near-fatalities, was responsible for a 1,450% increase in deaths or near-deaths of children in state custody. Alahverdian stated: \\"In 2008, DCYF investigated reports of the death of a child in their care. In 2003, we saw the tragic death of T.J. Wright. Within a five year timespan, we had two investigations of DCYF-related deaths,\\" said Alahverdian. \\"In the Chafee administration from 2011 to 2015, there were no child deaths. Yet under Gina Raimondo, we as a state have to take a seat and say to ourselves 'within 4 years there have been over 30 deaths or near-deaths.'\\" Alahverdian endorsed Cranston Mayor Allan Fung in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Also in October 2018, Alahverdian called for the Rhode Island General Assembly to pass legislation that has been pending for nearly a decade. The Administration for Children and Families, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, ordered DCYF to improve in 33 of 36 areas assessed. The federal report noted that DCYF services were \\"inadequate, not developed when needed, or lacked consistent monitoring.\\" Alahverdian stated \\"For three decades, we have seen reports nearly identical to this one: child deaths, an increase in caseloads, low staff morale, severe child abuse marked as ‚Äúinformation‚Äù cases ‚Äî cases that will not be investigated and that are only solely meant for taking reports and not conducting an investigation ‚Äî and comprehensive pandemonium within the DCYF.\\" Harvard Kennedy School professor and former Obama Administration official Jeffrey Liebman agreed with Alahverdian and claimed that the DCYF is \\"the most messed-up agency ever.\\" Alahverdian remarked that his comprehensive DCYF reform legislation, supported by current and former legislators, would provide the solutions to the problems that ACF ruled DCYF needed to solve. The Orphan Chronicles In October 2019, Nicholas Alahverdian announced that he was working on several volumes of memoirs called The Orphan Chronicles that will cover his life in DCYF care, simultaneously working for the state government, legislative advocacy, life and times at Harvard University, and how he persevered from DCYF care to the Ivy League. The first volume, Dreading and Hoping All, was released in late October 2019. This volume covers his experiences in Rhode Island, including the beginning of his political career as a legislative aide and a page, as well as being sent to the Florida placement. Cancer diagnosis In January 2020, multiple news agencies revealed that Alahverdian had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In an interview with Steve Klamkin of WPRO News following the diagnosis, Alahverdian expressed his desire to highlight the urgent need to improve the troubled RI DCYF. Alahverdian expressed his displeasure with Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo‚Äôs lack of leadership at the agency, especially since it is once again without a permanent Director since the forced resignation of Raimondo appointee Trista Piccola. Piccola presided during a two-year period which saw the death or near-deaths of 31 children, high staff turn-over rates, votes of no confidence, and high budget deficits. Alahverdian told Klamkin that \\"It‚Äôs a mistake to try to look at what DCYF is going to look like ten years from now. For DCYF to be improved, it has to start today, it has to start with the social worker, it has to start at the initial steps, where there is pride at the agency as opposed to the overburdened social workers that we see today.\\" NBC 10 News reported that \\"In 2020,\\" Alahverdian \\"remains critical of the state agency (RI DCYF), which has struggled with budget deficits and the safety of children.\\" In an interview with NBC, Alahverdian said \\"It's going to take willpower, energy and effective management to provide for the overhaul of the department.\\" 2020 legislation In February 2020, Rhode Island State Representative Ray Hull introduced another bill to create a DCYF legislative oversight commission in honor of Alahverdian. In an interview with The Providence Journal, Hull said, \\"I‚Äôve known Nick since he was a young kid, and now he‚Äôs sick. I‚Äôm delighted to put this in because we have seen so much turmoil at DCYF over the last couple of years.\\" Hull was referring to Alahverdian's cancer diagnosis earlier in 2020. WPRI reported that the bill would permit \\"The speaker of the House to appoint nine state representatives to the commission, and they would investigate any unconstitutional or unethical procedures at DCYF that put children in harm‚Äôs way. A report would be due from the commission next May.\\" Alahverdian told ABC 6 News that \\"DCYF has been fatally flawed and plagued with problems for decades. I've lived it, I grew up with it, and it's time for it to change.\\" Representative Hull added \\"If you look at the turmoil in DCYF and what may be happening to other children, it's more than adequate to push it forward now.\\" During an interview with The Providence Journal, Nicholas Alahverdian said, \\"an oversight commission would give legislators the authority, power and privilege to investigate DCYF in a way that has never been [conducted] before.\\" Co-sponsors of the bill included Reps. John J. Lombardi, David Bennett, and James N. McLaughlin. WPRI noted that \\"During his time as a page and legislative aide for the Rhode Island General Assembly, Alahverdian provided insight into the abusive and negligent practices by DCYF. The proposed commission was created in his honor.\\" In an interview with WPRI about the proposed legislation, Alahverdian said \\"The policy of this bill is the safety of children at every cost. The aim of this bill is adequate education and housing for children in the care of the state. People may ask at what cost. We say at any cost, for the life of a child in a system with a $220 million budget deserves at the very least food, schooling and stable shelter, and if possible, a family life. We must never give up, and I certainly won‚Äôt.\\" Death and memorials The Associated Press, U.S. News & World Report, and other news agencies reported that Nicholas Alahverdian died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on February 29, 2020, leaving his wife and two children. His wife told WPRI News that \\"He lived a warrior‚Äôs life. A fighter in spirit, but a peacemaker in practice. He overcame significant abuse and harmful living conditions.\\" Alahverdian's remains were cremated and scattered at sea. On Tuesday March 3, 2020, Representative Raymond Hull gave a speech on the floor of the Rhode Island House of Representatives in commemoration of the work and life of Alahverdian. In his speech, Hull said \\"I'd like to adjourn in the memory of my friend, Nicholas Alahverdian, who had a battle with cancer. A very, very smart individual when I started here some eight years ago, and I say this on purpose, and I say this to you young people that are standing there: have passion in what you do and never give up on it. He had that. And it touched me to be honored to get up to say something on his behalf today, because he believed in something that happened to him, and he looked forward to the change in DCYF. I ask that all my colleagues remember him. God bless.\\" After Representative Hull's remarks, the House of Representatives unanimously voted to adjourn in memory of Nicholas Alahverdian \\"as a further mark of respect.\\" The motion was made by Representative Hull and seconded by House Majority Leader Joseph Shekarchi and Minority Leader Blake Filippi. A moment of silence followed prior to the adjournment. On March 11, 2020, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Leaders Shekarchi and Filippi, and Reps. Ray Hull, and John Lombardi introduced House Resolution 7994 entitled ‚ÄúHouse Resolution Expressing Condolences on the passing of Nicholas Alahverdian.‚Äù The Resolution honoring Alahverdian was read by the Clerk of the House and passed unanimously by the House of Representatives, resolving that ‚Äú[the] House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations hereby extends deepest condolences on the passing of Nicholas Alahverdian.‚Äù Alahverdian was honored with memorial proclamations from Rhode Island Congressman James R. Langevin and several Rhode Island mayors including Allan Fung of Cranston, Jorge Elorza of Providence, Lisa Baldelli-Hunt of Woonsocket, and Bob DaSalva of East Providence. Of Alahverdian, Mayor Elorza said that Alahverdian was \\"a beloved community leader whose selflessness and lifelong contributions to the residents of the State of Rhode Island have earned him the unwavering admiration and respect of many.\\" On June 18, 2020, Senator Maryellen Goodwin, the Senate Majority Whip, introduced a Resolution honoring the memory of Alahverdian and expressing condolences to his family. The Resolution was voted on and it passed the Rhode Island Senate unanimously.

It narrates the encounter of Hanuman and Sovann Maccha during the construction of the causeway to Lanka in Reamker, a Cambodian version of Indian epic Ramayana.  History  Cambodian Sovann Maccha and Hanuman characters in 1906. = Robam = One of the earliest records of dance (Khmer: robam/ rabam) in Cambodia is from the 7th century, where performances were used as a funeral rite for kings. During the Angkor period, dance was ritually performed at temples. The repertoire of the female dance that was famously known in the West as Royal Ballet of Cambodia is composed of about 60 dance (pure dance pieces) and among them Robam Sovann Maccha, extracted from Reamker is an episode of great popularity among Cambodian audience. = Reamker = Hanuman flirting Sovann Machha (Middle Khmer period). National Museum of Cambodia. Phnom Penh. The original Ramayana arrived to Southeast Asia from South India along with Hinduism, but its adaptation there suggests Buddhist influence. The exact time that Ramayana was introduced to Cambodia is unknown. The earliest mentioning of the epic dates to the 7th century according to a stone inscription at Veal Kantel, Stueng Treng. Based on this inscription, the epic then existed in Cambodia as the inscription mentioned the offering of the epic's manuscript to a temple that expressed its importance in Khmer belief. The surviving text of Reamker dates to the 16th century. Intricate carvings on the walls of Angkor Wat depict a scene from the Ramayana dating back nearly a millennium. Statues of the poem's heroes were worshiped in temple sanctuaries, akin to the wall paintings at Cambodia's Royal Palace and Wat Bo. The Cambodian version includes incidents and details not found in the Sanskrit original written by the poet Valmiki. An example of a story that does not appear in Indian texts and performance is that of the encounter between Hanuman, the monkey general, and Sovanna Maccha, the mermaid, a favorite of Cambodian audiences.  Story  The dance narrates a scene of Reamker. Preah Ream (Rama) orders Hanuman to construct a causeway. He directed monkey troops to collect rocks and drop them into the sea. But these rocks kept disappearing. Hanuman dove into the sea to discover that the golden mermaid‚ÄîSovann Maccha‚Äîwas responsible for the disruption. While trying to overcome Sovann Maccha, they fall in love, then give birth to a monkey with a fish tail known as Macchanub. Hanuman explains to the golden mermaid why he needed the rocks. Sovann Maccha agrees to allow the causeway to be built, and returns the stolen rocks. She then assists Hanuman in the project.  Character and costumes  The characters performs in Robam Sovann Maccha consists of Sovan Machha- the golden mermaid who leads a shoal of fish disrupting the construction of the causeway to Lanka and Hanuman- the monkey general who leads a troop of monkeys. = Sovann Maccha = Sovann Maccha dancing in gold costume. In the past, Sovann Maccha worn mokot ksatrei, a single-spire crown as seen in the Reamker mural painting at Silver Pagoda in Phnom Penh and the Sovan Maccha dancer in 1900s. However, in today traditional dance, most Sovann Maccha character wears another type of crown known as mokot kantuy hong (hamsa's tailed crown). The costume is seen solely gold in accordance to the character's name (Sovannn Maccha) which is literally translated as golden mermaid. The ears are adorned with flora (flower and lbak pkar on both side), the earings, and chor trajeak (ears decorating jewelry). Unlike other female roles in Royal Ballet of Cambodia, Sovann Maccha does not wear sbai (a shawl-like garment worn in Cambodia) and only wears a gold long sleeved silk shirt. Around the neck and over the shirt is an embroidered collar known as srang kor. A decorated band of beads known as ksae sangvar is worn crosswise. Over the srong kor is a large-single pendant necklace. The character of Sovann Maccha wear a gold sampot sarabap. The sampot is wrapped around the lower body and then pleated into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. An embroidered piece of cloth is worn in front under the belt. Moreover, Sovann Maccha wears decorative and embroidered cloth with fish scale patter in the shape of a tail of fish (caudal fin) from the front to the back side with another piece of embroidered cloth drops downward. This caudal fin-shaped cloth piece distinguish Sovann Maccha from other female role in Royal Ballet of Cambodia. The jewelry for this role includes various types of ankle and wrists bracelets and bangles with many styles. = Hanuman = Hanuman costume with his mask. Human's entire costume can be seen solely white. The character wears monkey mask, designed specifically for the character. Hanuman also wears the srong kor, an embroidered collar around the neck. Unlike other female characters' costume, Hanuman's costumes are more intricate than the female role, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. The shirt that Hanuman character worn is a white silk long sleeved shirt with gold spiral as the pattern. Under the srong kor and over the shirt is a sangvar, an X-like strap around the body. A kite- shaped ornament called 'sloek por' is also worn on the centre point of the sangvar. The 'sampot' is worn in the 'chang kben' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the 'sampot' itself. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered hem around the knees. The other component of Hanuman's costume are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The front piece is called 'robang muk' while the two side pieces are known as a 'cheay kraeng' with another piece in the back called a 'robang kraoy'.

Mermaid companions  The costume of the other mermaid characters or fish shoal can be distinguished from Sovann Maccha via their blue costume and kbang (front crown) is worn instead of mokot kantuy hong. The rest of the decoration, jewelry, and costume is similar to that of Sovann Maccha.  Monkey troop  The other monkey troops plays minor in the dance, thus the costume is quite simple compare to Hanuman. The whole costume is seen as grey in color representing the fur of a monkey. The characters wears a simple mask with less decoration designed for this minor monkey role. The characters are shirtless, only wears the srong kor (an embroidered collar around the neck) and the X-like strap around the body called sangwar with a kite-shaped ornament called sloek por.

As a two-year-old in 2018 he showed top-class form to win two races including the Acomb Stakes as well as finishing second in both the Champagne Stakes and the Vertem Futurity Trophy. He recorded his greatest success on his first run of 2019 when he easily defeated a strong field to take the Irish 2000 Guineas. He failed to reproduce his best form in four subsequent starts and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Background Phoenix of Spain is a grey colt bred in Ireland by Cherry Faeste. As a foal in December 2016 he was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 78,000 guineas by Good Will Bloodstock. He returned to the Tattersalls sale ring in October 2017 and was sold to Howson & Houldsworth Bloodstock for 220,000 guineas. The colt entered the ownership of Tony Wechsler and Ann Plummer and was sent into training with Charles Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire. He was ridden in seven of his ten races by Jamie Spencer. He is from the fifth crop of foals sired by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Lope de Vega. His other foals have included Newspaperofrecord, Belardo, Vega Magic (Memsie Stakes) The Right Man (Al Quoz Sprint) and Santa Ana Lane (Stradbroke Handicap). Phoenix of Spain's dam Lucky Clio showed no racing ability, failing to win in five starts, but did better as a broodmare, producing six other winners. She was distantly descended from La Faisanderie, a full sister to Slieve Gallion. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= On 6 July 2018 Phoenix of Spain began his racing career in a novice race (for horses with no more than two previous wins) over seven furlongs at Sandown Park for which he started a 16/1 outsider and came home fourth behind the John Gosden-trained King of Comedy. Later that month in a similar event on the Tapeta surface at Wolverhampton Racecourse the colt was ridden by Callum Shepherd and started the 6/5 favourite against six opponents. After tracking the leaders he went to the front a furlong out and recorded his first success as he won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths. He was then stepped up in class for the Group 3 Acomb Stakes at York Racecourse on 22 August and started at odds of 9/2 in an eight-runner field. Phoenix of Spain was restrained towards the rear by Spencer before taking the lead a furlong out and winning by one and a half lengths from the favourite Watan. After the race Charles Hills said: \\"He was impressive at Wolverhampton and we felt York would suit him better. I thought Jamie gave him a great ride. He was a bit windy beforehand and he settled him well... You'd like to think a mile would be within his compass this season\\". James Doyle took the ride when Phoenix of Spain contested the Group 2 Champagne Stakes on 15 September at Doncaster Racecourse. He raced in third place and kept on well in the closing stages to finish second of the six runners, beaten one and a quarter lengths by the odds-on favourite Too Darn Hot. The colt returned to the same track on 27 October when he was moved up in class and distance for the Vertem Futurity Trophy over one mile and went off the 11/2 third choice in the betting. Phoenix of Spain came from well off the pace to dispute the lead inside the final furlong, but after being hampered in the closing stages he finished second in a blanket finish, beaten a head by Magna Grecia with Western Australia, Circus Maximus and Great Scot close behind. In the official ratings of European juveniles for 2018 Phoenix of Spain was given a mark of 112, making him the fourteen pounds inferior to the top-rated Too Darn Hot. =2019: three-year-old season= For his three-year-old debut Phoenix of Spain was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh on 25 May and went off at odds of 16/1. Too Darn Hot and Magna Grecia started joint favourites while the other eleven runners included Skardu (Craven Stakes), Mohawk (Royal Lodge Stakes), Shelir (Tetrarch Stakes), Emaraaty Ana (Gimcrack Stakes) and Van Beethoven (Railway Stakes). Phoenix of Spain led from the start, opened up a clear advantage approaching the final furlong and came home three lengths clear of Too Darn Hot in second place. Charles Hills said \\"The plan wasn‚Äôt really to make the running, but Jamie gave him an absolute peach and he‚Äôs some horse. He sustained that gallop all the way through and he just keep lengthening. He‚Äôs a big horse and whatever he did last year was a bonus. He‚Äôs got a hell of a future ahead of him\\". In June at Royal Ascot Phoenix of Spain started 5/2 second favourite for the St James's Palace Stakes but after racing in third place for most of the way he made no impression in the closing stages and finished sixth of the nine runners behind Circus Maximus. At Goodwood Racecourse on 31 July the colt was matched against older horses for the first time in the Sussex Stakes. He led for most of the way before fading in the last quarter mile and came home sixth as Too Darn Hot won from Circus Maximus. In September he was sent to France and ran fifth to Circus Maximus in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp Racecourse. On his final racecourse appearance Phoenix of Spain contested the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on 19 October. Ridden by Doyle he raced in second place before dropping out of contention in the last quarter mile and finished tenth behind King of Change, beaten almost twelve lengths by the winner. Four days after his final race it was announced that Phoenix of Spain had been retired from racing and would begin his career as a breeding stallion at the Irish National Stud in 2020.

The term is a portmanteau of \\"Olive\\" and \\"Hollywood\\". The strategy is predominantly allied to filmmaking for the Cinema of the United States and the Cinema of Europe.  Etymology  'Olive wood' is historically prized for its durability, colour, high combustion temperature and grain patterns. It‚Äôs a tree that derives from the coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, where the island of Cyprus is located. The Ancient Greeks farmed and spread it across the Mediterranean Basin. The term ‚ÄòOlivewood‚Äô is a portmanteau of \\"Olive\\" (wood/tree) and \\"Hollywood\\" that syndicates in meaning and significance.  History  Cyprus world cinema film production dates back to the 1950s, soon after World War II, with They Who Dare as first film noted on location on IMDb. More than 273 titles are credited on location since then, with the latest being Jiu Jitsu, the sci-fi martial arts franchise from Dimitri Logothetis, starring Nicolas Cage, Marie Avgeropoulos, Frank Grillo, Alain Moussi and Tony Jaa. The island is currently considered an up-and-coming film location, especially after the launch of new incentives and a Film Commission.Financial Mirror: William Baldwin stars in film being shot on location in Limassol Cyprus climate, landscapes, local talent, infrastructure and financial incentives has boosted its film industry more meaningfully in the past few years.  Climate  With predictability of weather being a key advantage for film production (340 days of sunshine year round) Cypriot climate becomes a significant production element. The continuum of natural light derives from the fact that Cyprus and Los Angeles are very close to the same latitude. The climate is defined by hot and dry summer from May to October, and a mild green winter with occasional rain showers from December to February. The distinctions are clear between the two main seasons, which are separated by a short autumn and spring.  Locations  Labelled as a natural film studio, the island has a diverse set of film locations and dissimilar morphology. Cyprus incorporates a historical and cultural landscape ranging from archaeological sites to antiquated villages, ancient city kingdoms, Greek amphitheatres, Byzantine art, 16th century Venetian architecture and modern European cities such as Limassol. Its long coastline, sandy beaches, light houses, ports, as well as pristine Mediterranean waters have been shot in various movie productions. The island incorporates flat plains that look like desert in the summer only to transform with rich green vegetation during the winter. Troodos Mountains provides peaks covered in snow, hilltops, valleys, waterfalls, traditional villages and vineyards. Salt lakes in Larnaca are packed with flamingos in the winter while the Akamas Nature Reserve is protected from any human activities. Notably, the island is the mythological birthplace of Aphrodite.  Inter-connectivity  The Republic has two deep-sea ports (Limassol & Port of Larnaca) and two international airports (Larnaca and Paphos) with more than 70 airlines operating, serving 120 destinations across 40 countries. Located at the crossroads of three continents, it is a short flight away from many prominent transit hubs. In 2018, Cypriot airports served a total of 11 million passengers. Direct flights to all major European cities are a key factor for productions with multiple locations. The short distances help filming dissimilar locations and reduce production times. Snow-white mountains to sunny beaches might take an hour of drive in an English designated road network. Advanced infrastructure by road, air and sea is supported with logistical solutions and services.  Shooting Permits  Shooting Permits is a requirement for most purposes. Film Producers must liaison with the key Government Agencies depending on the necessity:KFTV: Cyprus * Department of Civil Aviation * Deputy Ministry of Tourism * Department of Antiquities * Ministry of Health * National Guard * Cyprus Police  Genres  Popular commercial genres since the 1950s include action, comedy, sci-fi, romance, drama and melodrama along with noticeable documentaries from BBC and National Geographic.National Geographic: National Geographic‚Äôs latest travel stories about CyprusBBC: Island of LoveBBC Two: Mediterranean with Simon Reeve - Episode 1 There has not been a specific genre of film that has been traditionally associated with the island.  Incentives  An incentive scheme was introduced in 2018 to encourage more international productions.

Married to Pierrette Balse, professor of mathematics at the University of Orsay, they had three children, all scientists, Anne, Marion and Daniel.  Biography  He was elected correspondent of the French Academy of sciences in 1999 and then a member of the Institute in 2007.  Scientific career  During his postdoctoral internship in Dr. George Acs' laboratory in New York City, Sentenac addresses the regulation of gene expression by showing that appropriate hormonal treatment forces a young male cockerel to produce certain specific components of the egg. Back in France, to bypass the complexity of higher organisms, he chose to work on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the following years, this yeast will become an essential study model in the molecular genetics of eukaryotic cells. First, he isolated and identified the essential components of the molecular machinery responsible for gene transcription in yeast. He gave the first complete description of the three forms of nuclear RNA polymerases which are composed of the assembly of many subunits with various functions.Sentenac, A., ¬´ Eukaryotic RNA polymerases ¬ª, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., (1985), 18, p. 31-90 Focusing his efforts on the transcription of the large family of class III genes encoding tRNAs, 5S RNA and other small RNAs, he isolated the general transcription factors TFIIIC and TFIIIB and described the cascade of protein-DNA and protein-protein interaction leading to the recruitment of RNA polymerase III on DNA and the initiation of transcription.Ch√©din, S., et al., ¬´ The yeast RNA polymerase III transcription machinery: a paradigm for eukaryotic gene activation ¬ª, Cold Spring Harb.

The Audubon Society describes Hawk Ridge as \\"one of the premier sites in North America\\". P. B. Hofslund, one of the first ornithologists to conduct research there, pronounced it \\"one of the great hawk flyways of the world\\". Twenty-thousand birdwatchers visit Hawk Ridge each year to view the migration. It is an important site for ornithological research.  History  The area was originally frequented by hunters. \\"Hawk hill\\", as it was known, was a favorite location for shooting birds of prey. However, because the site was within the city limits of Duluth, the Duluth Bird Club (which later became the Duluth chapter of the Audubon Society) succeeded in having an ordnance enforced there prohibiting the discharge of firearms within city limits. Hofslund and the Duluth Bird Club helped to popularize the location as a site for bird watching. In 1972 the Duluth Audubon Society received a loan from the Nature Conservancy to purchase land at the location. The Duluth Audubon Society then donated the funds to the city of Duluth's parks and recreation department which purchased 135 acres at the highest part of the ridge. This land and an additional 200 acres became the Hawk Ridge Nature Reserve. Duluth Audubon and the city of Duluth created a nonprofit trust to manage the reserve, the Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory.  Geography  The Duluth Complex and Lake Superior. Hawk Ridge's location at the southern end of both create the unique conditions for raptor spotting. Lake Superior is a natural barrier for migratory birds of prey coming south from Canada. Rather than cross the lake, birds of prey follow the coast south. Between the bluffs of the Duluth Complex on one side and the coastline on the other, the raptors are funneled south until close to Duluth. Here, at Hawk Ridge, the concentration of migratory birds crosses the ridge and continue their migration.  Ornithological research  A sharp-shinned hawk at Hawk Ridge The concentration of migratory raptors makes Hawk Ridge a valuable site for conducting ornithological research. Hofslund and the Duluth Bird Club began annual bird counts in 1951. Banding started in 1972 and has taken place every year since. From 1972 to 2009, researchers and volunteers banded 99,505 raptors; the most numerous raptors banded are sharp-shinned hawks and saw-whet owls. According to ornithologists, the data provided from decades of counts and banding as well as the numbers of birds banded and the variety of species make Hawk Ridge an unrivaled location for the field study of raptors.

Born in Hamburg, Kummernuss found work in the city's port, and joined the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), then in 1912 became a full party member. That year, he also joined the German Transport Workers' Union. In 1915, he was conscripted into the army, serving on the Eastern Front and then after a serious injury, on the Western Front, before being invalided out in 1918. After the war, Kummernuss took a variety of jobs, and gradually rose to prominence in his union and in the SPD. He strongly opposed the Nazis, and when they forceably dissolved the unions, in 1933, he continued to organise illegal union meetings, working closely with the International Transport Workers' Federation. He was arrested in 1935, and spent several months in the Fuhlsb√ºttel concentration camp, before being sentenced to two years in prison. He was released in 1937, and found work in a warehouse, later becoming a factory manager. As soon as World War II finished, Kummernuss began organising a trade union in the civil service of the British occupying force. In 1947, he was elected as chair of the new Local Committee of Greater Hamburg of the German Trade Union Confederation, which represented the trade unions in the region, and also became the founding president of the Public Services, Transport and Traffic Union of the British Zone. From 1946 until 1949, he also served on the Hamburg Citizen's Committee, representing the SPD. In 1949, Kummernuss' union established the national Public Services, Transport and Traffic Union (√ñTV), closely based on its structure - for example, not including railway workers - and Kummernuss was elected as its first president. He also played a prominent role in establishing the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB), and served on the executive of the Public Services International (PSI). He was sharply critical of former Nazi Party members re-entering public life, and was often spoken of as a possible future leader of the DGB. However, he decided to focus on the √ñTV and, from 1956, an additional role as President of the PSI. Kummernuss' term as leader of the √ñTV ended in 1961, and as he was above the age limit, he was due to retire. However, the union voted strongly to change the by-laws so he could continue. In 1962, he was appointed to the Economic and Social Committee of the European Economic Community. He retired from his trade union work in 1964, moving to L√ºbeck. In 1971, he was elected to the seniors' council of the SPD. He died in 1979, and was buried at sea.

He was the editor of the Pentecostal Evangel and the author of 15 books. Life and Ministry Frodsham was born in 1882 in Bournemouth, England in a Christian home. As a young man he read a history of Hudson Taylor which he found inspirational. He later attended a YMCA in London, where he described a conversion experience. He then travelled to Johannesburg, South Africa where he worked for YMCA for a year in a secretarial role - a work that had just been established there. After this he travelled to Canada in 1906. On his return from Canada in 1908 Frodsham visited Alexander Boddy in his church in Sunderland, where a series of Pentecostal meetings had been taking place. Frodsham describes receiving the baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues. He returned to Bournemouth where he hosted the British-Norwegian Pentecostal pioneer, T. P. Barratt in 1909. Frodsham began publishing a Pentecostal paper, \\"Victory,\\" that same year. He became a pastor for the Assemblies of God in 1916, and was elected General Secretary within five years. By 1921 he would also be elected as editor of the Pentecostal Evangel, and all other publications of the Assemblies of God. In 1910, Frodsham returned to Canada where he met and married Alice Rowlands. In 1928, Frodsham wrote a history of the Pentecostal movement to date, called \\"With Signs Following\\". In all he wrote 15 books throughout his ministry. In the 1940s Frodsham became involved in the offshoot Latter Rain Movement which led to controversies among Pentecostals of the period and eventually led to Frodsham's retirement. A resolution of the Assemblies of God was adopted reinforcing their official disapproval for the movement and a statement to that effect was published in The Pentecostal Evangel after Frodsham's retirement. Owing to his writing and editing, Frodsham was affectionately known as \\"God's prophet with a pen\\".

It was founded in 1904 by Queen Saovabha Phongsri as a replacement for the recently closed Sunanthalai School, which she had previously also sponsored. The school is situated in Bangkok's Phra Nakhon District, at the southern tip of the historic inner Rattanakosin Island. Today it admits kindergarten to upper secondary students, with an enrolment of 2,861 in 2019, and is known for its traditional values. The historic Sunanthalai Building is a listed ancient monument. History During the late nineteenth century, Thailand, then known as Siam, was undergoing rapid modernisation of its education system. Schools were established by Western missionaries as well as the government of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). However, the King's focus was mostly on male education, and the creation of schools for girls lagged considerably behind those for boys. In 1892, the government-owned Sunanthalai Girls' School (or Sunandalaya, ) was founded under the leadership of Queen Saovabha Phongsri, partly in response to the rise of Christian schools‚ÄîWang Lang Girl's School (the precursor of today's Wattana Wittaya Academy) had been established by Presbyterian missionaries in 1874, and enjoyed support from both well-to-do commoners and elite families. Sunanthalai School was positioned much more traditionally, teaching royal domestic skills as well as academic subjects. However, while the school received interest from the extended royal family, the government and the King were less enthusiastic. The school struggled financially, and was closed down in 1902. One of the first classes of students, with Japanese principal Tetsu Yasui (seated, centre) On 1 April 1904 (some sources give 1903), Queen Saovabha established a new school using her own funds, and named it Rajini, meaning \\"the Queen's School\\". One of the main problems with Sunanthalai, in her view, was its curriculum being too Western (its initial teaching staff consisted of Western missionary women). Accordingly, Japanese educator Tetsu Yasui was hired as the new school's first principal, giving the school an Eastern orientation to counter the rising Western influence. Partly thanks to its direct association with the Queen, the school became popular among aristocratic families, and was also able to raise funds for expansion. The school was originally located in a shophouse building at the corner of Damrongrak and Chakphet roads in the Pak Khlong Talat area, but in its first year moved to a riverside building near Tha Chang Wang Na (now the Phra Athit Road area). In 1906, the King granted permission for the school to move into the previous campus of Sunanthalai School, where it has since remained. The school gradually grew throughout its history, and its curriculum modernized according to national developments. Princess Bichitra Chirabha Devakul, the first Thai woman to become a professional teacher, was the school's principal from 1907 until her death in 1943, and was extremely influential in the school's early development. Following Queen Saovabha's death in 1919, the school came under the patronage of several royals, until the Rajini Foundation was registered to manage the school in 1941. Campus The Sunanthalai Building, seen from the river in 2019 Rajini School is located at the southern end of Maharat Road, next to the old city moat where it meets the Chao Phraya River, marking the southern corner of the inner Rattanakosin Island of the old walled city. It is directly next to Rachini Pier and the Sanam Chai MRT station. The school has ten buildings, five of which hold classes, most notably the historic Sunanthalai Building. =Sunanthalai Building= The Sunanthalai Building was commissioned by King Chulalongkorn in 1880. It and the Sunanthalai School were named in memory of Queen Sunanda Kumariratana, one of his four queens, who died that year. Attributed by some sources to Italian architect Joachim Grassi, the building is designed in the neoclassical style, with a cross-shaped plan, hipped roof, and a large decorative pediment featuring stucco work depicting the royal coat of arms and the name \\"Royal Seminary\\", by which the building is also known. The building's two floors are recessed behind arcades spanning the entire width of the front fa√ßade. The front of the building was originally crowned with a tiered octagonal dome-shaped roof topped with a lantern tower, but this had been removed sometime between 1917 and 1946. The building originally had a twin building nearby, known as the South Sunanthalai Building or the \\"Clock Building\\". By the 1960s, the south building was deemed to have deteriorated beyond repair, and was demolished. Sunanthalai Building received the ASA Architectural Conservation Award in 1982, and underwent restoration in 1985. To commemorate the school's centennial, the Rajini Foundation in 2005 commissioned major restoration work aiming to bring the building close to its original appearance, including reconstruction of the dome and raising the foundation. The work was set back by a fire on 25 August 2005 which damaged the roof structure, though the restoration continued and was completed in 2006. The building was registered as an ancient monument on 23 June 2005. Governance and structure Rajini School operates as a private school, wholly owned by the Rajini Foundation. Mom Luang Pratintip Nakornthap serves as superintendent and Reongsiri Singhadej is the school director, as of 2019. The school teaches kindergarten to upper secondary levels (ages 4 to 18), and admits a small number of boys in its kindergarten and primary levels. It had an enrolment of 2,861 in the 2019 academic year, consisting of 2,785 girls and 76 boys. Today, the school continues its tradition of emphasizing qualities of the proper \\"Thai lady\\" as the values it instils in its students. It is known for its teaching of traditional handicrafts and skills, and its students often demonstrate crafts such as phuang malai garland making and fruit and vegetable carving at art festivals.

As of 2020 the organization is said to have a complete monopoly on the illegal activities in its domain areas.  History  The clan was founded by Antonio De Luca Bossa, known as ‚ÄòO sicco, in the 1990s. Antonio is the son of Umberto De Luca Bossa, who was a trusted member of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata and died from natural causes in 2008 after 18 years in jail. In the late 1980s ‚ÄòO sicco started his criminal career as a ferocious killer for the once powerful Sarno clan. At the age of 17, he was arrested, accused of involvement in a massacre led by the Sarnos in which six people died, four of them by mistake. In the early 90s, Antonio became a trusted member of the Sarno clan, however, he decided to create his own clan, which ended in a bloody war between the then newly created clan and the Sarnos for the control of the territory. The war has reached its peak, when, in 1998, ‚ÄòO sicco made the first attack with a car bomb in the Camorra's history, killing Luigi Amitrano, the nephew of the boss Vincenzo Sarno, the real target of the ambush. Eventually, Antonio De Luca Bossa was arrested and sentenced to life in prison. In the 2000s, thanks to the relationship between Teresa De Luca Bossa, mother of Antonio, with Giuseppe Marfella, boss of the Marfella clan, based in Pianura, the forces of the two clans united in fighting the Lago clan. The reorganization in the clan takes place, adding the interest in regaining control over Ponticelli, taking advantage of fall of the Sarno clan, thanks to the large number of arrests and most of their bosses becoming pentiti. However, this time did not last long, in 2010 Teresa De Luca Bossa was arrested and the clan gradually lost control of the territory, disputed by rival clans, such as the D'Amico clan (called Fraulella) and the De Micco clan (called Bodo). In the years when Teresa De Luca Bossa was in command, the clan also made an alliance with the powerful Secondigliano Alliance. Anna De Luca Bossa, sister of Antonio, is married to Ciro Minichini, a member of a criminal group also based in Ponticelli. They had a son, Antonio Minichini, who was killed in 2013 in the middle of the war between the De Luca Bossa and the De Micco clans. In September 2019, Anna was accused of involvement in the murder of Raffaele Cepparulo, leader of a small criminal group, and Ciro Colonna, an innocent victim. She was sentenced to life imprisonment. In the same trial, Michele Minichini, who was considered one of the leaders of the new era of the organization was also sentenced to life in prison. Minichini was known to have a good relationship with Ciro Rinaldi, boss of the Rinaldi clan, also based in the eastern part of Naples, making an alliance between the two clans.

Activities  Pasquale Brunese, a drug trafficker working for the clan was arrested in Valencia, Spain, in 2015, after seven years hiding from the Italian police. In Spain, Brunese owned a restaurant and was living with a false name. On October 31, 2019, Salvatore Ricciardi, considered an affiliate of the clan, was arrested by the Carabinieri on charges of having imposed the racket on a pizzeria in Cercola. According to investigators, Ricciardi is the \\"bagman\\" of the clan, designated to collect the racket money. According to investigations, the leaders of the clan usually do numerous parties in the Ponticelli area, always inviting singers to live performances, one of their favorite singers is the neomelodic Anthony Ilardo, who is known for his relations with members of the Camorra. On December 29, 2019, two \\"loan sharks\\" of the clan were arrested in Cercola, according to the investigations, in some cases they would impose usurious rates up to 720%.  Present day  According to the reports of the DIA, by 2019, after a time of strong decline, the De Luca Bossa clan is believed to be gaining power again in the eastern area of Naples, thanks to the merger with emergent groups, in particular with the Minichini. In fact, according to investigations, the group is now considered the most powerful clan in Ponticelli and in much of the Vesuvian area. On August 27, 2019, the Court of Naples issued an order for custody in prison for Emmanuel De Luca Bossa, the youngest son of 'O sicco. Emmanuel was already under house arrest for robbery and was found in possession of a gun during a recent search warrant. In September 2019, Umberto De Luca Bossa, son of 'O sicco, was released from prison, after more than two years in jail, accused of illegal gun possession. Also in September 2019, Tommaso Schisa, member of the Schisa's faction of the clan, became pentito. Schisa is said to have a important role in the alliance between the De Luca Bossa clan and the Rinaldi clan. In February 2020, Emmanuel De Luca Bossa, was released from jail. Since Umberto De Luca Bossa became new the leader of the organization, after his release from jail in 2019, was noticed the increase of the continuous and pressing extortion requests, exercised with threatening and even violent methods in the areas under the influence of the clan.

It was the biggest such scandal in the history of the nation up to that point, with an estimated 23.5 billion Japanese yen of unfair gains over fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Background and history The scandal is one example of the long-time practice of dango, where construction companies and bureaucrats exchange favors and kickbacks for a mutually beneficial outcome, causing less competition and increased costs for public infrastructure. In this case, former executives of JH had been given jobs in private firms in exchange for unreleased information about JH construction projects, part of a tradition known as . This had an effect on the public purse: an example is where contracts for bridges in Shizuoka Prefecture unfairly awarded in May 2004 increased JH's expenses by 45.7 million yen (). The parties involved included major steel companies such as Kobe Steel and Nippon Steel, as well as conglomerates such as Nippon Sharyo and Kawasaki. They were represented by two bodies: A-kai (A association) and K-Kai (K-association), which have reportedly existed since 1960. Businesses in both organizations had successfully netted most of the infrastructure orders between FY2002 and FY2004 put forward by regional bureaus of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).https://www.unafei.or.jp/publications/pdf/GG5/GG5_Adviser5.pdf Investigation On 22 May 2005, prosecutors raided the offices of the 47 firms involved, with eight in particular being focused on. Four days later, employees of 11 companies, including the eight previously scrutinized, were arrested. The then-vice president of JH, Michio Usida, was taken into custody on 25 July and fired from his position on 22 August. On 24 March 2006, the Fair Trade Commission of Japan ordered 44 companies to pay over 12.9 billion yen in surcharges to JH and the MLIT. Aftermath The Japanese government amended and strengthened anti-bidrigging laws in light of the scandal as well others around the same time. By 2009, it was determined that many of these measures worked, with a substantial decrease in noncompetitive bidding.

She was educated at Wimbledon High School from 1931-1938. She was good at mathematics at school, and her teachers suggested that she become an actuary. Career Allanach joined the Prudential Assurance Company in 1938 as an actuarial trainee. She qualified as an actuary in 1951. Women had been permitted to gain membership of the Institute of Actuaries for thirty years, but by 1951, less than one dozen women had become fully qualified. Allanach was moved to the male salary scale at Prudential in 1960, several years before the company introduced a single, non-gendered salary scale. She was appointed as the Deputy Actuary at the Prudential Assurance Company in 1970, thus becoming the first woman to reach management level at the company.

She is notable for having created, and having been the host of, the first roundtable discussion program on television.  Early years  The daughter of Maurice Joseph Talleyrand Sioussat, she was born in Baltimore and was raised by her aunt after her mother's death when Sioussat was seven years old. She graduated from Western High School and Goucher College and then worked in a variety of business roles, including being a secretary, a dental assistant, a business manager, and an assistant to a treasurer. She also was a professional dancer for a year.  Broadcasting career  Sioussat entered broadcasting as an assistant to Phillips Lord, a producer of radio programs. One of approximately 200 applicants, she admitted that she did not like radio, knew nothing about the medium, and did not own a radio receiver. She balked at Lord's initial salary offer of $50 per week, saying that she wanted more \\"because it's going to be much harder for me to do it than one of these other people.\\" By the time she reached her home, Lord was calling with an offer of $65 per week. She initially managed Lord's Washington office, gathering official information for his G-Men program. After that program was canceled, she was transferred to New York and was put in charge of all of the Lord programs, which included Gang Busters, Mr. District Attorney, and Seth Parker. In addition to her other duties, she selected members of casts, directed rehearsals, and wrote and revised scripts. In 1936, Edward R. Murrow, director of talks at CBS hired Sioussat to be his assistant. The following year, she replaced Murrow when he left that post to go to London. After a simultaneous realignment of duties at the network, she became responsible for all CBS non-commercial public affairs programs. Sioussat helped to formulate policies under the new setup, including fairness in granting air time to those who sought it. Her duties also included editing Talks, a quarterly digest published by CBS. Acceptance did not come easily in the male-dominated atmosphere that existed then. A vice president refused to authorize letterhead and business cards showing her as department head until the CBS legal department overruled him. When a male assistant was hired, he began the job at a higher salary than hers. She received raises later, but that initial discrepancy rankled her. Table Talk with Helen Sioussat was \\"the first question-and-answer discussion program on CBS.\\" It was broadcast from a CBS-TV studio in Grand Central Station in 1941-1942 on experimental station W2XAB, and its format worked well enough that it was essentially copied in later talk programs.  Other professional activities  Sioussat was a co-founder of American Women in Radio and Television, an organization to support female workers in media. She also wrote the book Mikes Don't Bite and wrote both the music and the lyrics for four songs.  Personal life  Sioussat was married twice and divorced twice by 1934. A feature article in The Baltimore Sun in 1953 described her as \\"an Elsa Maxwell type party-giver and party-goer\\".  Papers  Helen Sioussat papers are housed in the Library of American Broadcasting at the University of Maryland libraries. Donated in 1995, the collection includes citations, correspondence, financial records, manuscripts, photographs, press releases, transcripts, and other items.

Background In response to the increased number of school shootings elsewhere in the United States, the William S. Hart Union High School District had undertaken a number of measures to improve security at the school. According to the district's website, all schools have a school resource officer assigned to each campus. Schools are surrounded by fencing and supervisors monitor those who enter and exit the campus. Saugus High School has fencing and at least a dozen security cameras, but no metal detectors. The gates for the school are routinely locked during instructional time and would be opened only for students to leave for lunch or to leave school at the end of the day. Visitors are required to sign in and out of the school. The schools hold at least two lockdown drills per year, and use a \\"Text-a-Tip\\" hotline for students to report suspicious behavior. Each school has a \\"Safe Schools Ambassador,\\" a student trained to work within their peer groups to prevent bullying, teasing, and violence on campuses. Earlier in 2019, students at Saugus High School had participated in a class project to create a training video for dealing with an active shooter. Students who happened to be near this November shooting credited this project with helping them know how to respond. Each classroom was equipped with gunshot wound kits; at least one wounded student was medically treated from one of these kits during this event. Shooting Towards the end of period 1 classes at Saugus High School on November 14, 2019, while some students were in the outside courtyard or quad, a shooter later identified as a student at the school pulled a handgun from his backpack and fired on fellow students there. The weapon was later identified by Los Angeles County Sheriff as a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun, an unregistered \\"ghost gun\\" assembled from a kit. Surveillance footage documented the shooter's actions: after he fired one round, the pistol apparently jammed. He fixed it, shot an additional four people with the next rounds, including one in the stomach, and used the last to shoot himself in the head. The shooting started at 7:38 am and lasted sixteen seconds. The handgun was found outside the area of the shooting. Three off-duty police officers, who had just dropped off relatives at the school, were the first responders on the scene: a detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and police officers from Inglewood and Los Angeles. They were joined within a minute by uniformed deputies on duty from the sheriff's station in Santa Clarita, as well as a sheriff's deputy who works at the school as the school resource officer. The Los Angeles County Fire Department said firefighters also responded to the shooting before 8 a.m. Santa Clarita is a contract city that uses county sheriff and fire services in lieu of operating its own police and fire departments. Many students fled the area and some left the campus, while warning others. Teachers moved students away from danger into classrooms. One injured student escaped the quad and took refuge in the school's choir room, where the teacher barricaded the door and rendered first aid. Of those who barricaded themselves in classrooms, many used lessons learned in school shooting drills to fortify their protection. One student recounted that a student passed out scissors to all students in the room following the drill's recommendation to arm themselves with scissors, chairs, or anything heavy, in case the shooter were to find the hiding students.  Victims  Two students, 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger and 14-year-old Dominic Blackwell, were killed. Two girls, aged 15 and 14, and a boy, aged 14, were injured. Four students were hospitalized at the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, three in critical condition, including the shooter. Two were transported to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. The last injured student was released from the hospital on November 18. Aside from all being students of Saugus High School, the gunman and his victims reportedly had no known personal connection.  Perpetrator  The perpetrator was identified as Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow (November 14, 2003 ‚Äì November 15, 2019), a student at the school. Berhow carried out the shooting on his 16th birthday. He shot himself in the head with his last bullet and died the following day in a hospital. His parents had divorced in 2016, and Berhow lived with his mother and sister. Several students described Berhow as a quiet student who \\"seemed like one of those regular kids\\". Berhow was a Boy Scout and a junior varsity cross country runner for Saugus High School. Described as a good student, Berhow was taking an Advanced Placement class in history.  Investigation  Police documented the crime scene using a 3-D scanner. The school arranged to have it cleaned by November 15. Los Angeles County detectives joined with officials from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine whether the gun was made from a kit, that is, parts purchased separately and then assembled. Berhow was too young to have legally purchased such a handgun in California. During a separate investigation of Berhow's family home, the officers discovered several weapons, some of which were not registered. These may have belonged to his late father, who is reported to have been an avid hunter. The police confiscated the arsenal. A friend said that Berhow had grown up around guns and was taught to use them responsibly. The county sheriff announced that the handgun used in the shooting was a ghost gun, assembled from interchangeable parts without serial numbers. It remained unclear whether the gun was assembled by Berhow or Berhow's father before his death in 2017. Whoever assembled the gun kit was able to avoid many existing regulations regarding definition and registration of firearms, and associated background checks for possession and transfer. During the same search of Berhow's home, authorities told reporters that they had found no evidence to help them identify a motive: neither manifesto, diary, nor suicide note. Given the shooter's demonstrated familiarity with the weapon and speed of the attack, the county sheriff said he believed that the minor had planned the shooting. Aftermath Parents of students commended the school for having undertaken active shooter drills and its response during this event. They said the school's alert system kept them regularly updated about the incident. Some students told reporters they knew what to do based on previous drills. Some students discussed the potential identity of the shooter through social media, but policed the postings and refused to spread false information. The district closed other schools until the following week. Students were able to collect belongings left at Saugus High accompanied by a guard. Classes at Saugus High did not resume until December 2. Members of the community worked to offer emergency mental health support, grief counseling, prayer services or service dedications, and vigils to honor the victims and survivors. A memorial was created outside the high school, and a graduate brought a banner on which to write messages to the dead. At a football game on November 15, the school and students arranged to commemorate the dead. Fans chanted \\"Saugus Strong!\\", displayed the motto on stickers and signs, held a moment of silence, and released balloons. A \\"Saugus Strong\\" website was launched on November 15 for community resources, and supportive, loving messages were included. Another vigil was planned for students and the community on November 17, with a reported 10,000 individuals present to commemorate the two deceased victims and all those affected. Nearby schools were placed on lockdown throughout the morning of the shooting. At Pasadena High School, a group of students pasted 2,000 encouraging phrases, such as \\"You can do it\\", on each student's locker the day after the shooting, to give support to each other.  Response  = Political = Politicians such as President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Kamala Harris, and California Governor Gavin Newsom all used Twitter to express condolences for the victims and thoughts on the shooting. Many of the Democratic presidential candidates referred in their posts to gun control and stopping future school shootings. Celebrities also used social media to express their condolences about the shooting. US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, both Democrats from Connecticut, had been advocating for universal background checks when news of the shooting broke. When informed of events by an aide, Blumenthal incorporated the news into his speech, saying: \\"As I speak, on the floor right now, there is a school shooting in Santa [Clarita], California. How can we turn the other way? How can we refuse to see that shooting in real time, demanding our attention, requiring our action?\\" Organizations and activists such as Fred Guttenberg and Everytown for Gun Safety used the shooting to highlight their frustration at the lack of action by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, since he had led no action since calling for it after the El Paso shooting. Gun rights supporters disputed that any of the proposed gun control laws would have prevented the shooting and pointed to the gun control laws already in place in California that failed to prevent it. = Teacher and students = A teacher wrote an opinion piece about the shooting for The Washington Post, in which she stated her concern about the lack of action by politicians and organizations. She noted how common such shootings have become, as someone said to her, \\"It could have been worse. It's not like Saugus is Sandy Hook.\\" She objected to US Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith blocking a gun control bill during the shooting. Students took to social media to post about the shooting. Others raised concerns about going back to school in the aftermath. A student said in an interview with CNN that \\"...with the state of America right now, with gun control not being strict enough, with kids being able to access guns so easily, it didn't surprise me.\\"  See also  * List of mass shootings in the United States in 2019 * List of school-related attacks * List of school shootings in the United States * List of shootings in California References Category:2019 crimes in California Category:2019 in Los Angeles County Category:2019 mass shootings in the United States Category:2019 murders in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2019 Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:High school shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in California Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Murder in Los Angeles County Category:Murder‚Äìsuicides in California Category:November 2019 crimes in North America Category:November 2019 events in the United States Category:Santa Clarita, California ","title":"Saugus High School shooting"},{"id":"62344881","text":"Sin√©ad N√≠ Uallach√°in is an Irish journalist, actress, artist and radio presenter.

Overview  Invitation Homes markets itself as a uniquely \\"worry free\\" single-family rent company in comparison to mom-and-pop businesses that make up most of the industry, which guarantees customers \\"peace of mind\\" with \\"exceptional resident services,\\" including \\"24/7 emergency maintenance.\\"  History  = 2005‚Äì2012: Background and formation = In 2005, entrepreneur Dallas Tanner formed the housing and apartment investment company Treehouse Group in Arizona; between 2010 and 2011, it bought 1,000 distressed houses in Phoenix, a city heavily impacted by foreclosures caused by the subprime mortgage crisis and one the first areas where private equity investor purchases of homes for rent took place after the 2008 crash. In 2011, Treehouse paired with the Dallas-based property management firm Riverstone Residential, a merge noticed by The Blackstone Group; Tanner explained that Blackstone felt Treehouse and Residential \\"had a perfect model in terms of one market [Phoenix], a high concentration of residential product, and a consistent operating history.\\" The pairing merged with Blackstone in the spring of 2012 into a new entity named Invitation Homes, with Blackstone giving Treehouse and Residential more capital to expand the business. = 2012‚Äì2017: Initial purchases = Invitation Homes' first home purchase was in April 2012, and within a year, the entity became the largest buyer of homes for rent in the United States with 24,000 homes, spent with $4 billion; section 8 properties made up 16% of the portfolio. In April 2013, it made a single, $100-million-plus purchase of 1,400 Atlanta homes from Building and Land Technology. From August 2012 to June 2013, Invitation Homes purchased 1,650 homes in the Tampa Bay Area for a total of above $250 million, $840,000 a day. The Tampa Bay Times, in a June 2013 article, reported 85% of Tampa Bay online listings by Invitation Homes were above the area's average rent of $1,200. Wall Street was purchasing houses in \\"strike zones,\\" neighborhoods located near several jobs, schools, and transportation systems that were also facing high amounts of foreclosures, and sold them to middle-aged parents raising children making around $100,000 a year or more. As the 2010s progressed, so did Wall Street's focus on single- family housing, a movement led by Invitation Homes. In 2013, Invitation Homes created an asset class of single-family rental securities (SFR) to have money for purchasing houses and restoration; by January 2017, nearly $10 billion of the bonds were sold, a number that went to $15 billion in July 2018, a month- and-a-half after the February 2017 initial public offering. = 2017‚Äìpresent: Initial public offering and merge = On January 23, 2017, Fannie Mae funded $1 billion of debt to Invitation Homes as back-up money; the enterprise, only four years prior, stopped another government-sponsored entity buying distressed homes, and Fannie's acquisition with the Blackstone entity was the first time in history it backstopped a single-family house landlord company. According to Corinne Russell, spokesperson of Fannie Mae regulator Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the deal was a way for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to learn about the mechanics of the single-family rent market and what the government enterprises' role should be in it. Writes MarketWatchs Ryan Dezember, \\"Fannie Mae's involvement is a sign that it believes homeownership will remain out of reach for many Americans and that Wall Street's housing wager will be become a long-term business, not just an opportunistic trade made after the foreclosure crisis.\\" The decision received criticism from more than 25 affordable-housing advocate groups, who believed Fannie Mae wasn't following its principle of protecting home owners. In February 2017, Invitation Homes became a public company via an initial public offering, the second-largest initial public offering of a real estate investment trust in the United States with $1.77 billion. Wall Streets housing institutions scaled through mergers after most distressed houses were bought, climaxing into a merger of equals between Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint, a corporate spin-off of Starwood Capital Group, in November 2017. The merge was praised by JMP Securities' Aaron Hecht, \\"The geographic footprint of the portfolios overlay with each other pretty well. Scale means a lot in this business, because you are managing all these individual properties. So you need enough concentration in areas to become efficient.\\" What followed the merge was an 18-month integration between Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint. As of 2018, Invitation Homes is the largest single-family rental housing owner of all time, public or private, with 82,000 properties in 17 Sun Belt cities and a portfolio 58% bigger than American Homes 4 Rent, its nearest competitor. It was the top REIT of 2018 in the rankings of several of 17 analysts; all of them, except Goldman Sachs who gave the company a hold rating, rated it a buy. 17 months after its February 2017 IPO, its stock price rose by 11%. The corporation's addition of fees grew annual earnings by around 20-to-30-percent. Blackstone owns a 42% stake of the entity, which equates to $5.1 billion.  Criticism  Wall Street companies in the rent industry, especially Invitation Homes, have garnered strong backlash from real estate experts and affordable-housing activists for screwing tenants to fulfill investors' pockets; the primary argument is that the corporations are incentivized keep repair costs low and fees and rent prices high in order to increase bond sales that determine their scale. California Reinvestment Coalition's Kevin Stein derogatorily labeled the business model \\"securitization of rental income.\\" Although chief operating officer Charles Young stated renters have the \\"optionality and freedom\\" to rent from Invitation Homes and that 70% of its user re-leased, only a few of the tenants interviewed by Reuters for a July 2018 article admitted to renewing because they enjoyed the company's services; others stated they had to renew due to a lack of other options. An analysis of Census and property data by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Maya Abood of four Los Angeles County neighborhoods where Invitation Homes single-family rents are located show that the percentages of rents it owns in a neighborhood ranged from 10% to up to 25%. A December 2016 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta study stated Wall Street rent corporation evicted tenants significantly more than regular mom-and-pop landlords; it reported Invitation Homes evicting 15% of its renters, and the entity it would later merge with, Starwood Waypoint, 30%, and stated being African-American also increased chances of being evicted if under a company like Invitation Homes. Complaints and horror stories from Invitation Homes' customers have been covered on publications and news stations such as CBS 46, CBS Sacramento, The Arizona Republic, and NewsChannel 5 Nashville. Mold; sewage; water leakage; nail poking out, infestation of vermin such as spiders, cockroaches, and ants; broken appliances such as garage doors, heating systems, stoves, and microwaves; and unfulfilled repair requests are frequent issues. Places such as Oakland, California have raised rents by 10% per year, double the usual percentage for markets, which is attributable to Invisible Homes, stated the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE). There have been three protests at Blackstone's California offices by Invitation Homes tenants organized by ACCE, such as one in October 2017 at Blackstone's Santa Monica headquarters, which involved the tenants placing letters on the desks to hold a meeting with the corporation's executives and stop practices of excessive rent prices, fees, and poor maintenance; the company never got back to them. Invitation Homes has faced several lawsuits from courts throughout the country. In May 2018, tenants filed a class action against the corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, with a rationale of excessive rent price increases and fees; they reported being charged $95 if even a minute late on a rent payment, regardless if the company's online payment system is broken, and filing eviction notices that added more \\"unfair\\" legal costs, fees, and penalties for them to bear. On July 20, Invitation Homes responded with a motion that stated the class action group and its plaintiff had too little evidence. Staff of Invitation Homes has responded to the criticisms, including chief operating officer Charles Young who in July 2018 stated the company had an average rating of 4.32 stars out of five from tenant surveys it ran. Despite Congress passing legislation banning broker's price opinions after the mortgage crisis, it's legal for Invitation Homes to use them due to a loophole where the law doesn't apply to bonds of multiple homes. For the entity, the other firm's BPOs are a less-costly alternative to mortgage appraisal by licensed contractors typical of the housing market; according to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that started in September 2017, they involve inspections by independent contractors unlicensed to do appraisals, who are only assigned to inspect the exteriors with the assumption that the interiors were already renovated. One of the single-family securities looked at by Reuters contained 7,024 houses, each of which was making the entity an average rent of $1,538 a month and $985 a year for other fees. Reuters also interviewed five Invitation Homes ex-employees that stated the company spent too little on repairs; the bond data showed it spent a per-house annual average of $1,142 on maintenance, less than the typical $3,100 average most Americans spend for the same services, although the entity responded that the $750 spent on system back-up costs wasn't shown.

He played a prominent role in rebuilding the Palestinian revolution's military apparatus and training troops alongside Yasser Arafat, Khalil al-Wazir, Mohammed Yousef Al- Najjar and others. Life and career Sayel was born in the Kafr Ghalil village located in the eastern foot of Mount Gerizim, \\"Jabal et Tur\\" one of the mountains of Nablus. He spent his elementary and secondary education there. He traveled to Jordan when he was 19 years old and joined the army there. In 1951, Saad Sayel went to the Jordanian Military College to receive specialized military training and after military training, he was assigned to the command of the Hussein ibn Ali infantry brigade with Colonel rank. He spent the military engineering course (Bridge Design and Classification Engineering) in England in 1954. Also he spent the bridge design course in Iraq in 1958 and the military engineering course in England again in 1959. In 1960, after passing advanced military engineering in the United States, he joined the United States Army Command and General Staff College. In 1965, he spent the air defense course in Egypt. Also, he went through special courses in the Soviet Union. In 1965, Saad Sayel joined the Palestinian uprising. He joined the Fatah movement in June 1967. After the withdrawal of the Palestinian forces from Jordan in 1970, Saad Sayel joined the Palestinian revolutionary forces with a large number of his brigade officers. Then he gathered Jordanian revolutionary officers and established the Yarmouk Brigade, which played an active role in Lebanon and Palestine later. When Sayel joined the Palestinian National Liberation Movement Fatah, he was assigned to important military positions. For example, he appointed as director of the Central Operations Authority of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces, a member of the General Command of the storm forces and a member of the leadership of the Occupied territory after being promoted to the rank of brigadier general. Also, he was a selected member of the Palestinian National Council and elected to the Central Committee of the Fatah Movement in its conference held in Damascus in 1980. Abu al Waleed participated in the management of the military operations of the Palestinian revolutionary forces in their confrontation with the Israeli forces in Lebanon and get the title of Marshal of the Beirut because of his braveries. In 1980, he became a member of the Central Committee of Fatah movement and led the Central Operations and Command Room of the Lebanese Joint Forces Palestine . In June 1982, after the Israeli forces besieged Beirut, Saad Sayel was one of the most prominent field commanders . That is why it became known as the \\"Marshal of the Revolution\\" among the resistance forces. Sayel was considered to be one of the most prominent Palestinian military and militants in the history of the contemporary Palestinian revolution. Memorials * A military garrison at east of Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, is named Saad Sayel after his death. * Raymonda Tawil, the famous Palestinian author, has mentioned the role of Saad Sayel in his book, \\"A bunch of roses to them\\". Death He was assassinated by Abu Nidal group in Lebanon, near Syria border on 29 September 1982. He had gone to Beqaa Valley to visit the Popular Front and the Lebanese Joint Forces. Then he went to the hospital there for visiting someone and continued his way to Baalbek. After passing through the city Riyaq, near the Syria border, Between Talia and Safri villages, about 500 meters to the Syrian army checkpoint, a number of armed forces who had already lurked in the area fired on three Benz and Jeep escorts carrying Saad Sayel. The driver was killed on the spot and Saad Sayel was injured by a bullet. An hour later, he was taken by ambulance to the Mowasat hospital in Damascus, where he died at 11pm from severe bleeding and cardiac arrest. At the next day, his body was carried on the shoulder of his comrades in Damascus and buried in the al-Shohada tomb of the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee camp. Some sources reported that Israeli intelligence agency Mossad intended to assassinate Palestinian commanders remaining in Lebanon. Saad Sayel (Abu al-Waleed) was at the top of these assassinations list. Demolition of the Saad Sayel's grave by ISIL In 2015, ISIL terrorists captured the Yarmouk camp and destroyed the al-Shohada tomb in the first act. They destroyed the graves of the Palestinian revolution martyrs who had been buried there for 65 years, including Fathi Shaqaqi, Saad Sayel, Khalil al-Wazir and Zuheir Mohsen, in pretext of confronting the manifestations of disbelief. In fact, ISIL's goal of destroying these graves was to search for the remains of several Israeli soldiers who were killed by Syrian soldiers in June 1982 in the battle of \\"Sultan Yaqub\\" and whose bodies were buried there in the camp. ISIL was looking for the remains of Israeli soldiers bodies and attended to return those to Israel. Whether they succeed or not is unclear. While condemning these ugly acts contrary to the religious principles and customs, the Saad Sayel's family called on all Syrian freedom fighters to take revenge for this heinous crime against the ISIS terrorist group. The Sayel's family also called on the Palestinian authorities to do its utmost to move the bodies of the martyrs from the Yarmouk camp to Palestine, as this is one of the rights of martyrs' families. Also, Ezzat al-Rashq one of the Hamas leaders, in response to this event announced: We strongly condemn the demolition of al-Shehda's tomb and the grave of two Palestinian martyrs \\"Khalil al-Wazir\\" and \\"Saad Sayel\\".

Early life Darton was born in south London on 20 March 1882. She was the youngest of the seven surviving children born to Edward Hack Darton and his wife Adeline. The Darton family had been involved in publishing since the 1830s, but she did not follow into the business. Darton is described as a student shorthand writer/typist in the 1901 Census It is not clear when she became a photographer, but a picture taken by Darton of the Old Meeting House in Barking appeared in The Friend, which was the Quaker Newspaper, on 21 August 1908. She later wrote an article about becoming a professional photographer in the Church League for Women's Suffrage newspaper on 1 September 1915, describing how the training necessary ‚Äúis not such a lengthy and costly process as is the case with many other professions.‚Äù Activism Darton photographed Theresa Garnett and Lillian Dove-Willcox for the 6 August 1909 issue of Votes for Women, illustrating the article about their trials. Later that year, a newspaper article in Votes for Women on 29 October marked Darton‚Äôs enrolment as a member of the WSPU, where she wrote that she was ‚Äúproud to become a member of a society whose adherents have shown themselves to be so entirely self-sacrificing and noble.‚Äù Within two months she was advertising photography in \\"Votes for Women\\", offering to cover the costs of materials ‚Äúin all cases where it might be of service in advancing the propaganda work of the WSPU‚Äù. Throughout 1910, 1911 and 1912 she was involved in speaking at WSPU meetings in north London, whilst running her photography business. She does not appear in the 1911 Census, presumably as part of the WSPU resistance campaign. In February 1912 Darton and her friend Dorothy Jolly set up the North Islington and Hornsey WSPU office at 19 St Thomas‚Äô Road, Finsbury Park. In January 1913 her support for a Cake and Candy Sale in North Islington was acknowledged in The Suffragette, and she continued to speak at meetings in 1913.

These were sold through the CLWS and directly from Darton‚Äôs business at 40 Stapleton Hall Road, Stroud Green, London. As a result of this, Darton began advertising in the CLWS newspaper, with testimonials from the Bishop and Reverend Hinscliff in the September 1913 publication. By February 1914, Darton was temporary secretary of the North Islington branch of the WSPU, a post which she held for some months, as well as continuing her photography business. She photographed mothers and babies at the South West Ham branch of the East London Federation of Suffragettes in December 1914.

Convicted of three of them, Bladel was sentenced to life imprisonment, and later died from thyroid cancer in 2006. Early life Bladel was born into a railroad family with one half-brother in Chicago, on December 8, 1932. His father, Holgar, worked for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad company. Rudy grew up on 67th Street and Ashland Avenue, studying at the Vocational High School in the South Side, where he took automotive shop courses. After graduating in 1951, he went to work at Rock Island as a fireman, before enlisting in the army as a military engineer, to serve in the Korean War. Bladel later claimed that when he went under a routine check-up in the military, he scored an IQ of 145. While in South Korea, he \\"hostled\\" locomotives in a roundhouse, sometimes under enemy fire. Shortly after returning from Korea, Bladel got in a motorcycle accident, the injuries of which gave him a very specific posture. Despite this, he went back to Rock Island, where he rose steadily in the company ranks. However, in 1959, the New York Central Railroad shifted its operations away from Niles, Michigan to a new yard in Elkhart, Indiana. In addition, most of the employees would be locals, leaving the previous ones from Michigan, among whom was Bladel, with a lower-rank job or were just laid off. This angered Rudy, to whom the railroad work was his entire life, to such an extent, that he decided to take revenge on the union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, whom he felt had sold him out. Crimes =Roy Bottorf and Paul Overstreet= The first killings occurred on August 2 or 3rd, 1963, in a Hammond, Indiana yard. After failing to receive a return signal from his colleagues in the locomotive cab, 52-year-old signalman Virgil Terry decided to investigate the matter. He climbed on the engine, and noticed that 60-year-old Roy Bottorf, the engineer, and 45-year-old Paul Overstreet, the fireman, were lying dead on the controls. Both had been shot in the back of the head, with several .22 caliber shell casings being located at the scene. Terry called the police, and although they investigated the matter, no suspects were found in the murder. The only clue they had was from a witness, who had heard a motorcycle leaving the crime scene. At the time of the slayings, Rudy was living alone in a trailer in Blue Island, Illinois, and drove around with a motorcycle. =John Marshall= Bladel struck again on August 6, 1968, killing 51-year-old engineer John W. Marshall, from Niles. Marshall was standing next to his diesel locomotive at the Elkhart rail yard when he struck with close 12-gauge shotgun blasts to the midsection, the sides and twice in the head. This time, there were eyewitnesses to the murder, but they could only describe the killer by his build and strange walk. =Shooting of John Sayne= On March 30, 1971, there was another shooting at the Elkhart yard: 38-year-old engineer Louis John Sayne, from New Buffalo, Michigan, was shot in the back twice with a .357 magnum revolver. Unlike the previous victims, however, Sayne survived, managing to wrestle the gun from his assailant's hand and fire in retaliation, wounding him in the stomach. Both men were driven to the hospital's emergency room, where Sayne recognized his attacker as one of his old workmates - Rudy Bladel. He inquired about his reasoning, with Bladel replying that he wanted \\"to get the Niles men out of Elkhart\\". On December 31, 1971, Rudy was sentenced to a one-to-five year imprisonment term at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City for attempted murder. He was released after serving 18 months. =James McCrory= The killing spree continued not long after, and on April 5, 1976, another victim was claimed in the same yard at Elkhark: 51-year-old engineer James M. \\"Tiny\\" McCrory, from Niles. He had been shot in the head with a deer slug from a 20-gauge shotgun while sitting in his locomotive cab, which was parked near the diesel house. Almost two years after this murder, Bladel was arrested by ATF authorities on January 6, 1978, after local police notified them that he had purchased a .357 magnum from South Bend. Since he was a convicted felon, he was not allowed to carry firearms, and given another one-to-five year imprisonment term, this time to be served in a federal penitentiary at Sandstone, Minnesota. He was released on November 16 of that same year. =Triple murder= A day before New Year's Eve in 1978, Bladel booked into a local hotel in Jackson, Michigan. With him, in a suitcase, he carried parts of a 12-gauge shotgun, purchased from an Elkhart gun shop around two years ago. The following day, he left the hotel and went down to the depot, carrying the suitcase with him. When he arrived on the platform, he put the suitcase down, assembled the shotgun and walked towards the locker room door. He shot 50-year-old flagman Robert Lee Blake, from Southgate, on the spot, before proceeding to also shoot 50-year-old conductor William Gulak, from Lincoln Park, who was sitting at the table. Bladel put another slug into each of them, and then headed for the door. As he was going out, he saw 32-year-old fireman Charles Lee Burton, from Jackson, peeking into the room. He then killed him as well, the shot knocking Burton on the platform behind him. After leaving, Bladel disassembled the shotgun and hid it under some bushes at Cascade Falls. He then returned to Elkhart, where he was living at a mission for homeless men. Capture, trial and imprisonment The Jackson murders startled the authorities, and they quickly connected them to the previous murders of railroad workers. At the time, Bladel was questioned, but released after two days for lack of evidence. In search of clues, scuba divers were deployed into the Grand River and helicopters scoured rooftops for the murder weapon. They even contacted psychics, to no avail. Three months later, the shotgun parts hidden in Cascade Falls were located, and ejection marks from spent shell casings proved it was the murder weapon. The shotgun itself was traced back to Bladel through its serial number, who by then had been reconsidered as a suspect, when his 1971 attempted murder conviction was discovered. On March 22, 1979, charges were filed against Rudy Bladel, and he was arrested at the mission that same afternoon. He initially confessed to the Jackson murders, explaining in detail what happened, but later recanted his statements, claiming he had been coerced by the police. He additionally explained that he had gone to Jackson so he could retrieve his broken motorbike, and when it comes to visiting the depot, he had only gone there to wash his hands. As for the shotgun, he claimed that it was his, but he had sold it to a stranger in Elkhart several weeks before the murders. The evidence to the contrary was enough, and Bladel was convicted for the Jackson murders, receiving a sentence of life imprisonment. Michigan v. Jackson In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that Bladel's case should be retried, as jurors considered that his written confession had been obtained through illegal means. Even without the confession, the jury convicted him a second time, and he was again given life imprisonment. Edward Grant, the then-prosecutor, described it as the costliest case prosecuted in Jackson County. He was one of the two respondents on whose cases Michigan v. Jackson was based. It was later overruled by the Supreme Court, following Montejo v. Louisiana. Death On November 15, 2006, Bladel died from thyroid cancer, in the Henry Ford Allegiance Health Hospital in Jackson.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is by far the best known Helicobacter species primarily because humans infected with it may develop gastrointestinal tract diseases such as stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, doudenal ulcers, stomach cancers of the non-lymphoma type, and various subtypes of extranodal marginal zone lymphomass, e.g. those of the stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and rectumn. H. pylori is also associated with the development of bile duct cancer and has been associated with a wide range of other diseases although its role in the development of many of these other diseases requires further study. Humans infected with H. suis may develop some of the same gastrointestinal diseases viz., stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and extrnodal marginal B cell lymphomas of the stomach. Other non-H. pylori Helicobacter species that are known to be associated with these gastrointestinal diseases are Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter salomonis, Helicobacter felis, and Helicobacter heilmannii s.s. Because of their disease associations, these four Helicobacter species plus H. suis are often group together and termed Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato. H. suis bacteria are detected in the stomachs of their natural hosts viz., pigs and non-human primates. Reports suggest that individuals, including children, are infected with this bacterium by having close contact with infected pigs (or possibly other, unidentified infected animals) or by eating raw pork taken form infected pigs (H. suis remains viable for up to 48 hours in fresh raw pork): H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases, including those associated with H. suis, appear to be zoonotic diseases, i.e. infectious diseases that are caused or promoted by a pathogen(s) that spreads from animals to humans. It is important to diagnose H. felis as well as other Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato infections in patients with the cited upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, including in particular extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because some of them have been successfully treated and cured using antibiotic-based drug regimens (e.g.amoxicillin, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor or metronidazole, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor) directed against the instigating bacterium.

It runs from Christmas M√∏llers Plads in the west to a roundabout on Prags Boulevard in the east and then continues south to Holmbladsgade. History The oldest section of the street, from Holmbladsgade to Prags Boulevard, was originally called Holmblads Boulevard. It was the first stage of a planned boulevard with upscale housing. The area to the north of Prags Boulevard was released from the military demarcation line in 1909 and the ownership of most of the area was subsequently transferred to the city. In the early 1910s, Vermlandsgade was created as a fairly short street linking Uplandsgade in the west with Prags Boulevard in the east. It was part of a group of streets in the area that were named after historic landscapes of Sweden. The unset of World War I resulted in an upswing for industry in neutral Denmark. In 1914, the area along Vermlandsgade and Prags Boulevard was zoned for industrial activities. This brought an end to the original plans for an extension of Holmblads Boulevard. In 1925, the first short section of the unrealized Holmblads Boulevard was instead merged into Vermlandsgade. In 1938, Vermlandsgade was extended westwards to present day Christmas M√∏llers Plads. This new section of the street was made extra wide to make room for a projected rail line, a side track to the Amager Line, that was never realized. Notable buildings The Vennelyst housing estate(No. 2-), on the corner with Amagerbrogade, was built in 1938 to designs by Vilhelm Hvals√∏e. With its combination of red brick and balconies, it is a typical example of Danish Functionalist architecture of the 1930s. The flour processing company Gluten‚Äôs former factory, located on the corner with Uplandsgade, was one of the first industrial buildings at the street. It was built in 1918 to designs by Holger Jacobsen. The industrial building at No. 55 is the former headquarters of AGA. In December 2019, it was announced that AGA will be moving to Ballerup and that the 17,500 square metres complex on Vermlandsgade had been sold to PFA and Tylander Group. The Danish Association of Managers and Executives (Ledernes Hovedorganisation) is based at No. 65.

Each grid has an overall theme and these vary according to the subject being taught. The term became well known throughout social media, and its creation and popularity has been credited to previous Michaela Community School teacher, Joe Kirby. Origins and use In 2015, Michaela Community School teacher, Joe Kirby, wrote a blog detailing the value of listing, on one side of A4 paper, key points to learn. He coined the template a knowledge organiser. To construct a knowledge organiser, the unit of study and the content requiring to be taught needs to be identified. Subsequently, around five to ten key points based on the key areas are documented on one column and their definition in the opposite column. Dates, events and characters can be listed as items to learn. Individually tailored, knowledge organisers may be more useful in subjects such as history rather than English. The method has increased in use by a number of teachers who can then clarify what is important to learn. References External links *Knowledge organisers. Kirby, J.

He was a Valmiki worker in cartridge manufacturing unit of British East India Company. He was first person who sowed seeds of 1857 revolt. History According to historical narratives, Matadin was a worker in a Cartridge manufacturing unit of East India Company.He was employed there as during those times working with leathers and skin of dead animals was considered as the occupation of low castes.The orthodox upper caste Hindus used to consider them as \\"impure\\".One day Mangal Pandey, a soldier in company's service was asked for water by Matadin but due to age old belief of touching a low caste person as \\"polluting\\", he refused. Matadin thus made him realise that, it is paradoxical that he is proud of his birth in a high Caste Brahmin family, still he bites the cartridges which are made up of the fat of Cows and Pigs with his mouth.This propelled both Hindu as well as Muslim soldiers of the company to raise the banner of revolt as, while the Cow was considered as sacred for Hindus, the Pigs were forbidden for Muslims. According to Subaltern historians as well as Dalit activists, he should be recognised as the real face behind the revolt of 1857.This is bacause, he was the person who made Mangal Pandey aware of the fact that their religious sentiments are being hurt knowingly or unknowingly by the British.Thus; he was first person who sowed seeds of 1857 revolt.

The star is in the Grus (or Crane) constellation in the southern sky, and about 29,000 light- years from Earth. According to astronomers, S5-HVS1 was ejected from the Milky Way galaxy after interacting with Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. It is possible that it was originally part of a binary system that was tidally disrupted by the supermassive black hole, causing it to be ejected. If this is the case, that it was flung out of the galaxy by the central black hole, it is then the first example of a star that has undergone the Hills mechanism. The star's discovery has been credited to Sergey Koposov, assistant professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University, as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5).

Her research interests focus on the intersection between science, policy, and the design of environmental management. She is currently a professor and ARC Future Fellow at RMIT University (Melbourne, Australia) in the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies. She leads the Interdisciplinary Conservation Science Research Group (ICON Science).  Education  Sarah Bekessy started her post-secondary education at University of Queensland in Queensland, Australia where she attained a Bachelor of Science (Hons). Bekessy completed her doctorate (1999 ‚Äì 2003) at the School of Botany, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, where she studied approaches for the conservation of threatened Monkey Puzzle Tree.  Career  Following her PhD, Sarah Bekessy was a research fellow with the University of Melbourne (funded by David Yencken, the Australian Collaboration) where she studied sustainability and policy. Before joining RMIT University in 2004, Bekessy held a research fellowship with the Canadian Forest Service, where she worked on landscape modelling for evaluating forest management strategies. Bekessy has been with RMIT University as a lecturer and professor in the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies since 2004, and teaches specialized courses in sustainability, urban, rural and regional planning, and conservation biology, as well as various courses on environmental practices. She has supervised a number of graduate and post-graduate students. Bekessy is involved in a range of interdisciplinary research, including her ARC Future Fellowship titled ‚ÄòSocio-ecological models for environmental decision making‚Äô. She also has an ARC Linkage project entitled ‚ÄòDesigning green spaces for biodiversity and human well-being‚Äô. She is the convener of ICON Science, a group of researchers working to better understand and manage societal and natural environment interaction, seeking methods to solve real world problems, regardless of what discipline these solutions originate from. In addition to her academic role, Bekessy engages actively in consulting projects, and has worked on projects with the Commonwealth Department of the Environment and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, among others. Bekessy is a member of the Editorial Board of Conservation Letters and Natural Resources Modelling and a past member of the editorial board of Conservation and Society.  Collaborations  Bekessy's research is high impact, interdisciplinary and collaborative, and helps create highly applicable solutions for environmental problems, conservation, and urban planning. She helps bring \\"the people\\" into the conservation discussion and investigates social and political aspects of conservation decision making. Her group brings together experts in social science, ecology, physics, psychology and many other disciplines. Bekessy is a project leader in the Threatened Species Recovery Hub (Theme 6), and a theme leader in the Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub of the Commonwealth Environment Science Program. She also acted as a theme leader for the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (2012‚Äì2018;), and is a chief investigator with the Horizon2020 Urban GreenUP and the UN Habitat: Enhancing urban resilience to climate change impacts and natural disasters. Bekessy is also a member of the Environmental Decision Group and a member of the Green Building Council Expert Advisory Committee for Biodiversity and Ecology.  Research contributions  Bekessy's work contributes to the development of collaborative solutions for conservation. Bekessy has published work on nature-based solutions for cities, such as urban pop-up parks for insect biodiversity and wildlife gardening, conservation of natural features, biodiversityBekessy S, Gordon A, Nelson A. Nurturing Nature in the City. Steering Sustainability. Melbourne, Australia: NATSEM Research Centre of AHURI, Melbourne; 2007. p. 120‚Äì57. and threatened species in cities. She has also published on technical and policy issues surrounding biodiversity conservation, including the integration of conservation and land-use planning in urban landscape design, the use of market-based instruments for biodiversity conservation, such as biodiversity banking or nature off-setting, population modelling, and climate change adaptation. Bekessy's work has included commentary on institutional change for sustainability and sustainability education, as well as science and conservation communication, including the impact of messaging to influence human behaviour, targeting high impact behaviour. Bekessy's work has contributed to the efforts toward ‚Äúre- enchanting people with nature‚Äù and has been instrumental in the development of programs to reconnect children to everyday nature, biodiversity and cultural heritage. She is an advocate for increased transparency and evidence in biodiversity conservation strategy development, and for increasing and improving collaborative and interdisciplinary solutions for the environment. Bekessy's team has been involved in research to help shape future policy designed to improve landholder participation in, and collaboration on, private land conservation schemes. Some examples that Bekessy's team have helped influence include Greenfleet bio-carbon plantings, and reverse auctions in Western Australia. During her career Bekessy has published over 100 articles and conference proceedings, over a dozen book chapters, and has co-authored three books, including the children's book The Little Things that Run the City: 30 amazing insects that live in Melbourne! which was produced as part of the development of the City of Melbourne Urban forest and Nature in the City Strategies and has been used by children in Melbourne during Nature Play Week and in schools around Melbourne.  Research impacts  The application of Bekessy's work on the preservation of biodiversity in cities has included working with Green Building Council, to develop a green star rating system for biodiversity in building, leading to the Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) protocol. The protocol received an A+ from The Industry News and Analysis blog ‚ÄúSourceable‚Äôs Living Infrastructure Report Card‚Äù in 2016. Bekessy and her team have contributed to biodiversity plans for local, state, and international agencies. She has also worked with urban developers on projects such as Fisherman's Bend, Melbourne. They continue to improve the development of biodiverse cities through their research, such as the application of ecological principles that can increase biodiversity in cities through ‚Äúmore-than-human‚Äù planning and the designing of actions that can help multiply biological diversity. ICON Science and Bekessy's work has also informed scenarios for the future of Cumberland Plain Woodland, in Sydney, Australia.Gordon A, Langford W, Bekessy S. Modelling the growth of Sydney and the impacts on the Cumberland Plain Woodland. Report prepared for the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities; 2011 p. 22. Her team has been involved in strategic assessments including those done in Melbourne and their recently completed, ‚ÄòReimagining the Australian Suburb: planning for biodiversity in the urban fringe‚Äô (funded by the Myer Foundation), may help inform the creation of new grassland reserves and guide development planning for the avoidance of important grassland features and their protection in urban fringe areas. Work by Bekessy and her team was used in the development of the City of Melbourne Urban Forest and Nature in the City Strategies, including a biodiversity connectivity plan, and surveys of insect biodiversity in the City of Melbourne.  Public roles  Bekessy sits as a board member of Bush Heritage Australia, an independent not- for-profit that purchases and manages land, in partnership with Aboriginal people, for the protection of important landscapes and native species.

He made outstanding contributions to the development of historical geography both in theory and in practice. Biography Hou was born in Zaoqiang County, Zhili Province, on December 6, 1911. He grew in Encheng, Pingyuan Counnty, Shandong Province. At the age of 21, he was inspired by Gu Jiegang to start learning history at the Yenching University, Beijing. He studied history with Gu Jiegang and from William Hung. He graduated with both a B.A (in 1936) and later an M.A. in history and continued to teach at the university, where he met and later married Zhang Weiying. Hou Renzhi with his wife Zhang Weiying, 1938 Hou planned to study in England, but in 1941 he was imprisoned after the Japanese captured Yenching University, and, as one of the leaders of the student body, he was sentenced for 1 year, and was limited in his movements upon his release. He and his wife settled in Tianjin until the end of Second Sino- Japanese War. In 1946, after the war, Hou started studying his Ph.D. at Liverpool University, and he graduated in 1949, writing his thesis on the historical geography of Beijing. Hou returned to China and worked as associate professor at the history department in Yenching University. and later held several positions at Peking University, including the deputy provost of the university, dean of the department of geology and geography, and dean of the department of geography. In 1950, Hou was appointed part of the \\"Beijing Urban Planning Committee‚Äù to advise on Beijing's urban planning. In addition, he advanced historical geography research in Chengde, Handan, Zibo and other historically significant cities. Hou also studied the deserts in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia and Gansu, to provide advice and information concerning the planting of sheltering forests. During the Culture Revolution (1966‚Äì1976) Hou was criticized for his work and he was transferred to the countryside, to a May Seventh Cadre School in Jiangxi for physical labor and reform. In 1972, Hou returned to academic studies and research, and published his first collection of academic papers in 1979. In 1980, Hou was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1984, Hou became a visiting researcher at Cornell University. During his time, he learned about the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Hou, appealed to the Lianghui to have China part of the convention, and he wrote a proposal to convince the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. On December 12, 1985, China ratified the convention. In 1987, the Forbidden City, the Great Wall of China, and the Zhoukoudian became the first Chinese sites to be listed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO. Hou is sometimes considered as \\"the first person to apply for the Chinese heritage\\". Hou died at the age of 102, in October 2013.

Early life and education Danny Fread was born on July 17, 1939 in Tuscola, IL, the son of Harold and Margaret E. Dyer Fread. Danny graduated from Lovington High School, in Lovington, Illinois. He began his undergraduate studies at Carthage College, in Carthage, IL, where he studied liberal arts and excelled in track and field as well as basketball. Danny set a school record for his javelin throw in 1959 and was reputedly the \\"team's best pole vaulter.\\" and lettered in basketball, where he was known for his \\"deadly jump shot.\\" Fread then transferred to the University of Missouri-Rolla, in Rolla, Missouri and received his B.S. in Civil Engineering in 1961. He ranked first in his graduating class. Career After completing his undergraduate degree, Danny Fread worked six years for Texaco, where he was promoted to Senior Engineer, specializing in the design of gravity and pressurized piping systems. He then returned to University of Missouri-Rolla to complete his Ph.D. in civil engineering in 1971. His studies focused on hydraulics / hydrology / mathematics, and his research was centered on unsteady flow and numerical / experimental simulation of breached dams. After earning his degree, he became a research hydrologist with the National Weather Service, where he spent 29 years. Inspired by the tragedy of the failure of the Grand Teton Dam in 1976, he undertook research on the development of computer models to forecast the flow of flooding rivers and dam failures. His 1973 ASCE paper presented a conceptual model to alleviate flood damages due to overtopping failures of small earthfill dams. It discussed erosion patterns and the potential reduction in the reservoir release due base on a proposed erosion retarding layer. During the 70's and 80's he personally formulated, coded, and tested mathematical simulation programs, including: * The DWOPER model simulates unsteady flows from rainfall runoff in river systems * The DAMBRK and SMPDBK models simulate unsteady flows from breached dams in a single river * BREACH simulates the erosive formation of breaches in earthen dams * FLDWAV is an improved simulation model of unsteady flows from rainfall-runoff and from breached dams in a single river or network of rivers. These models have been utilized for unsteady river flow modeling by Federal and State Agencies, as well as private agencies and consulting firms across the United States and Canada and over 20 countries worldwide. Dr. Fread taught numerous training workshops; authored 50 and co-authored 42 professional scientific papers; and contributed chapters to four books including the Handbook of Hydrology. He was also a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society. His career culminated with the position as the Director of the Office of Hydrology with the National Weather Service. Awards and recognition Danny Fread received several national awards for his work, including: * Department of Commerce Gold Medal * Walter L.

It has smooth, greyish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between eleven and fifteen, creamy white flowers and hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus notactites is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, white and pale grey bark that is shed in strips, revealing reddish tan new bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly elliptical to more or less round, dull to slightly bluish green leaves that are up to long, wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between eleven and fifteen on a flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are yellowish, an elongated oval, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from November to January and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical, sometimes ribbed capsule long and wide with the valves at about rim level, the fruit in crowded clusters. Taxonomy and naming Southern limestone mallee was first formally described in 1992 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill and given the name Eucalyptus goniantha subsp. notactites. The description was published in the journal Telopea, from specimens collected near the Mount Melville garbage tip in 1986. In 2012, Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French raised the subspecies to species level as E. notactites. The specific epithet (notactites) is from the Greek notos, meaning \\"the south\\" and aktites meaning \\"a watcher\\", referring to the species occurring on the coast, facing the southern ocean. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus notactites grows in often dense mallee shrubland along the coast between the Flinders Peninsula in Torndirrup National Park and Cape Arid National Park, including some offshore islands.

Biography Born May Egan in Ireland in 1872, she was a comedian and singer on the London music halls and then in Paris where she performed her trademark nonsensical songs at the caf√© des D√©cadents and the Petit Casino. She commissioned the famous 1895 Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec poster showing her wearing the red dress with her ever present black cat. She became a favourite of the artist who painted her more than once. She performed in Russia, South Africa and the United States during her career. Belfort was the friends with Jane Avril. May Milton was her lover as was Boer General Ben Viljoen. In fact Belfort expected to marry Viljoen. When it turned out he was already married and unwilling to continue the relationship with her, she traveled to Chicago and horsewhipped him in the street. Even after he achieved a divorce, he married another woman. Belfort retired from the stage due to ill health. Due to bad investments in mining, Belfort lost her money and ended working as a rug weaver and living in poverty. She died after a lingering illness in the United States in 1929.

Band development  In 2009, Them Are Us Too (TAUT) was formed as a \\"solo high school bedroom noise pop project\\" by Kennedy Ashlyn. She had grown up listening to 1980s music, such as the B-52s, Cocteau Twins, and Dead Can Dance. At 5 years old, she began singing in a choir, and she also participated in musical theater. She did opera training in college. In 2012, Ashlyn and Askew met at University of California, Santa Cruz at Askew's 19th birthday party. The party had a \\"goth\\" theme, and attendants listened to music such as Cocteau Twins, The Sisters of Mercy, and Depeche Mode. The two bonded over shared musical tastes at the party. Askew had grown up in San Francisco, California. She identified as transgender and used feminine pronouns. She first learned guitar from her stepfather, Sunny Haire, who was the former manager of the Lexington Club. In an interview, Askew explained, \\"As a young teenager, I was definitely attracted to goth and new wave in part because of the androgyny. And that aesthetic gave me a way to explore my gender expression before I could even come to terms with being transgender.‚Äù While at UC Santa Cruz, she was a student at Kresge College. One day after the birthday party, Ashlyn invited Askew to join her band. As Ashlyn recalled, > \\"The day after the party, I was playing one of the only three Them Are Us > Too shows that I did without Cash, at this weird hippy commune. We were > drinking moonshine, walking around arm in arm, and I was just like, 'You > should be in my band.' It was pretty immediate‚Äîday one: friends; day two: > bandmates. We‚Äôd always call her birthday our 'friendaversary,' and then the > next day is our 'bandaversary.' In their first session, Askew attempted to play the synthesizer, but she then switched to the guitar.  Musical sensibility  The duo felt a deep creative connection. As explained by Ashlyn, \\"There are things that I could say to Cash like, 'The snare should be like this,' or even, 'Can we make that bass tone a little bluer?' And she would know exactly what I was talking about.\\" The band had a dark aesthetic, but the duo rejected the \\"gothic\\" label. As Ashlyn noted, \\"We weren't [into] like the lifestyle goth by any means. We always felt personally a little tongue-in-cheek [towards it]... I see more of a parallel in this new [era] of darkwave music. People like Drab Majesty, Boy Harsher, Tamaryn‚Äîbasically all of my friends.\\"  Albums and tours  At first, TAUT recorded an 8-song demo out of Ashlyn's bedroom. Soon after, the duo dropped out of college in 2014 and began a West Coast tour. The band played shows in Los Angeles, where they met Sara Taylor of Youth Code. Through Taylor, the group were introduced to people from Dais Records. In 2015, TAUT released their debut album, Remain, on Dais Rercords. At the time, both Ashlyn and Askew were 21 years old. On the Dais Records website, it was written, \\"With a nod to 80‚Äôs shoegaze sensibilities, Them Are Us Too creates songs about tragedy and loves-lost that draws devoted listeners to their nostalgic and innocent sound.\\" The voice of Kennedy Ashlyn was compared to Kate Bush and Elizabeth Fraser. Meanwhile, Askew played guitars and \\"paints a layered and complex backdrop,\\" with reverberation and \\"washes of stringed ambient tones.\\" Following the release of Remain, TAUT played at various musical festivals, including the Terminus Festival in Calgary, Canada. In this period, they also began to work on songs for a second album. In the summer of 2015, the band recorded with Michael Stock at the KXLU 88.9 FM studio for the Part Time Punks studio sessions. The music video for \\"Eudaemonia\\" premiered in August 2015, and the pair were interviewed by various media outlets, such as Vice Magazine. In the fall of 2015, the band toured with Wax Idols. Askew moved to Oakland, California and Ashlyn moved to Denton, Texas. While Askew was in Oakland, she worked on two solo projects: Prist (techno music) and Heavenly (\\"emotional noise\\").  Ghost Ship fire  On December 2, 2016, Askew died in the Ghost Ship warehouse fire. She was 22 years old.‚ÄòAll we could do was stand there‚Äô: She watched Oakland‚Äôs inferno consume the one she loved the most Askew had planned to attend the Ghost Ship event with her girlfriend, Anya Taylor, but Taylor had decided to not attend, since she had to work at a coffee shop in the early morning. Once the news of the fire broke out, Taylor rushed to the scene with four friends, but there was nothing they could do. ‚ÄúWe knew our girls were in there. All we could do was stand there,\\" Taylor said. The Ghost Ship fire left a profound impact on underground arts communities of the San Francisco Bay Area and the United States. In 2017, the band Drab Majesty released a song Oak Wood in memory of Askew. In 2018, Ashlyn released Amends, which featured songs that the duo planned to record together. In December 2016, Askew was commemorated along with other victims of the Ghost Ship fire at the \\"Oakland United\\" benefit concert. At the concert, Ashlyn and Anya Taylor, Askew's girlfriend, performed a rendition of \\"Sweetness\\" by Jimmy Eat World in her memory Ashlyn continued making music under the name SRSQ.

Her research considers infectious diseases, the development of low cost point-of-care diagnostics and global health. In 2020 she was named as one of Chemical & Engineering News's Talented 12.  Early life  Kamariza was born in Burundi a few years before the Burundi Civil War. Kamariza became interested in science as a child, and enjoyed reading books about planets. Girls rarely attend college in Burundi, but Kamariza enrolled at a government-managed Catholic school. During Kamariza's childhood, she often had to move due to the ongoing civil war. Kamariza observed the ravages that infectious diseases such as AIDS and malaria have on already vulnerable populations. But whilst malaria and AIDS receive significant media attention and funding, they are not the most lethal conditions in Africa. In 2015, tuberculosis killed 1.4 million people, considerably more than AIDS, and there is still significant stigma surrounding the disease. In 2006, Kamariza and her brothers moved to San Diego, California. Together they lived close to San Diego Mesa College, where Kamariza took classes alongside working to support herself. Saloua Saidane, one of her professors, noticed her talent and suggested that she focused on her education. Following Saidane's advice, Kamariza quit her job at Safeway. Kamariza transferred and completed her bachelor's degree in biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. At UCSD, Kamariza and her colleagues established a peer-to-peer mentoring program that paired transfer students with current UCSD students. Her efforts inspired other initiatives at UCSD, including supporting transfer students in identifying research opportunities. Her impact on UCSD was recognised by her undergraduate dean David Artis, who referred to Kamariza as one of his \\"all- time favorite students\\". She was awarded an American Chemical Society (ACS) internship to work at the ACS headquarters.  Education and research  In 2012 Kamariza moved to the University of California, Berkeley for her graduate studies in cell biology. She applied to join the research group of Carolyn R. Bertozzi. After earning her master's degree, Kamariza joined Stanford University as a graduate student, still working in the Bertozzi laboratory. Here she developed a new point of care diagnostic device for tuberculosis (TB). Tuberculosis is caused by the mycobacterium tuberculosis, a bacteria that has a cell wall so dense that it is difficult for drugs to penetrate. Trehalose is a chemical compound that is found in a range of living organisms that is used by mycobacterium tuberculosis as a scaffold. Kamariza developed DMN-Tre (4-N,N-dimethy-laminonaph-thal-i-mide-trehalose), a molecule that lights up when it is incorporated into the cell walls of mycobacteria. Her research was commercialised, and together with Bertozzi she founded OliLux Biosciences, a company that looks to develop low cost diagnostics for low- income countries. It was awarded a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant to test their diagnostic devices in places with high levels of disease. She has tested it with small groups of patients in South Africa. In 2017 Kamariza was selected as one of Fortune magazine's World's Most Powerful Women. Kamariza was appointed a Harvard Junior Fellow at Harvard University in 2019. She examines topics regarding precision medicine in global health. She was named one of Chemical & Engineering News's Talented 12 in 2020.

She won the 2008 Australian National Criterium Championships and was second in that year's Tour de Perth. Aged six, Hibberd took up BMX before moving onto mountain biking and then road cycling.through a talent identification scheme. She began riding competitive events in 2004 and went on to compete in several women's events organised by the UCI. Hibberd was hit off her bike by a road car while training in Northern Italy and died from her injuries. A memorial trophy and park in Toowoomba are named after her. Biography Hibberd was born on 11 May 1985, in the Brisbane suburb of Sherwood, Queensland. She was the daughter of Mark and Roslyn Hibberd and has one brother. Aged six, Hibberd began racing BMX in Toowoomba, often with the future professional cyclist Jared Graves, before the family moved from Toowoomba to the Sunshine Coast around 1997. She later took up mountain biking, and was subsequently introduced to road cycling by a talent identification scheme in 2000. Hibberd did so to provide herself with a greater number of opportunities for her career. She attended boarding school and then was accepted into a scholarship scheme at the Queensland Academy of Sport from 2005 to 2007. Hibberg became a member of the Ipswich Cycling Club. In 2004, she won the Tenthill Classic road race.

Before the 2011 season, Hibberd moved to the Cassina Rizzardi A Style Fionucci squad. She competed in two events, the GP Liberazione and the GP Comune di Cornaredo. Hibberd was due to marry her fianc√©e Cameron Rogers in October 2011. Death On 6 July 2011, she was with her training partner and fellow cyclist Diego Tamayo in fine weather conditions on a road between Appiano Gentile and Lurate Caccivio to the north of Milan when a car struck her at around 10:45 local time. According to Tamayo, Hibberd was about behind when the female driver of the car steered left and hit her bike. Her riding helmet had come off in the impact and she was killed instantly. Tamayo attempted resuscitation before paramedics arrived by helicopter to tend to Hibberd. On 29 July she was given a funeral at the Ashgrove Baptist Church in Brisbane attended by her family and friends. Legacy The organisers of the 2011 Giro d'Italia Femminile cancelled the podium ceremony for its sixth stage out of respect for Hibberd. The competing Australian riders planned to wear black arm bands in Hibberd's memory and they requested a moment of silence be observed to remember her before the seventh stage began. The Carly Hibberd Memorial Trophy was established by her first coach David Budden after Hibberd's father consented to the idea to honour \\"a tenacious female rider\\" in 2012. It is awarded after the Toowoomba BMX Club's open day by her parents who deem on the best rider who won the award on merit. On 20 January 2015, Toowoomba Regional Council voted unanimously to name a park in its \\"Cycling Estate\\" located on Nelson Street, Kearneys Spring after Hibberd following lobbying by Budden for additional memorialisation of the cyclist.

He served as Minister of Education from 1922 until 1923, and was president of Keio University for over 20 years. Educational career During the 1880s, Kamata was a teacher at Keio University, where he had previously been a student. Kamata succeeded Tokujiro Obata as president of the university in 1898. He left the position in 1922, and was succeeded by Kadono Ikunoshin as interim president before Ichitaro Fukuzawa took over full-time. In his role at the university, he put across his progressive views, taking part in American customs like throwing the ceremonial first pitch in the university's newly built baseball field. Kamata was an advocate of gender equality, believing it was necessary to accompany the \\"equality between the classes\\" within post- feudal Japan. Writing in the educational-cum-movie magazine Katsudo no Sekai, he proposed the use of motion pictures for educational purposes. He also published essays in Kokuhon alongside other prominent educators and university presidents. Alongside these progressive views, Kamata used his position at the university to push his patriotic view of independence, believing that education was key to accomplishing the goals of the nation-state. In 1920, he suggested that students \\"must not be deceived by deceptive ideologies nor follow the group blindly [but] realize the spirit of freedom, and independence and self-respect\\". During his presidency there, Keio established its graduate programmes, established the schools of medicine and nursing, and became accredited by the Japanese government as one of the country's first private universities. Ministerial career Kamata served as Minister of Education from 1922 until 1923. On 11 November 1922, Kamata was present at Japan's first large-scale Armistice Day celebration in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.

Early life His parentage is unknown. He had a brother named Lucas, who donated his unidentified lands to the Diocese of V√°rad (present-day Oradea Mare, Romania) in his last will and testament. Lucas owned the land of Sz√°zd in Hont County (today Sazdice, Slovakia), which he pledged to certain nobles, comes Stephen and Herbord, sons of Ibor, but he failed to elicit the estate by 1299. There is no any record of his potential university studies. It is plausible that Emeric functioned as lector in the Diocese of V√°rad prior to his bishopric, mentioned in this capacity from 1281 to 1285. He participated in the election of Bishop Thomas in 1282. The people of Olaszi (today Olosig, part of Oradea), √öjfalu and Szentl≈ërinc in Bihar County, considered themselves as the personal serfs of Bishop Bartholomew, refused to pay customs to the cathedral chapter in 1285, which referred to an old tradition while demanded it. During the lawsuit, the bishop entrusted three canons, lector Emeric, Francis, the archdeacon of Bihar and canon Jonah, to swear to this old supposed privilege on 11 June. Although the people refused to acknowledge the validity of the oath, Bartholomew confirmed the cathedral chapter's right of collection of customs. It is dubious whether Emeric is identical with that namesake canon, who acted as a notary of Bishop Benedict in 1292. Bishop of V√°rad =Political commitment= Emeric was elected Bishop of V√°rad by the summer of 1297 (nevertheless, the cathedral chapter's official list of bishops incorrectly dated his election to the year 1300). Despite the pro-Angevin efforts of Archbishop Gregory Bicskei, the overwhelming majority of the Hungarian prelates with the leadership of Archbishop John Hont-P√°zm√°ny, also including Emeric, remained supporters of King Andrew III of Hungary against the pretender Charles of Anjou. Consequently, Emeric was also present at the Diet in Pest in the summer of 1298, which declared Andrew as the rightful king and, among others, established a four-member lesser council within the royal council, consisting of two nobles and prelates. When Bicskei, in contrast, convened a synod to Veszpr√©m with his self-declared authority of papal legate, and obliged the bishops to participate at the event, the prelates, including Emeric refused to attend. On 6 July 1299, Emeric was commissioned to send a letter to Pope Boniface VIII to interpret the complaints of Andrew III, Archbishop John and the \\"entire prelacy and nobility\\" regarding the behavior of Bicskei and asked Boniface to place them under papal patronage against the metropolitan of Esztergom. Andrew III died in 1301. With his death, the House of √Årp√°d, the first royal dynasty of Hungary, ended. A period of Interregnum and civil war between various claimants to the throne ‚Äì Charles of Anjou], Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria ‚Äì followed Andrew's death and lasted for seven years. Despite Charles' invalid coronation performed by Bicskei in the spring of 1301, the overwhelming majority of the prelates, including Emeric supported the claim of Wenceslaus. Emeric was a member of that delegation which traveled to Bohemia in July 1301 to offer the Hungarian throne to the young prince. He was present at the coronation of Wenceslaus on 27 August 1301. Pope Boniface sent his legate, Niccol√≤ Boccasini, to Hungary. In October 1301, he summoned and convinced the majority of the Hungarian prelates to accept Charles's reign. By 31 May 1303, when the pope declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary, Emeric also belonged to the partisans of the Capetian House of Anjou. In that year, Emeric wrote a letter to Albert I of Germany, in which he requested the monarch to provide assistance to his relative Charles in his struggle for the Hungarian throne. On behalf of the papal legate Gentile Portino da Montefiore, Emeric negotiated with the Transylvanian provincial lord Ladislaus K√°n in February 1309, but the powerful baron refused to hand over the Holy Crown of Hungary. Emeric was also present and contributed in the second coronation of Charles I on 15 June 1309. During the era of feudal anarchy, Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. Almost the whole territory of the Diocese of V√°rad belonged to the sphere of interest of James Borsa, a strong domestic supporter of Charles since the early 1300s. Their relationship was initially cooperative; for instance, the oligarch provided armed protection to the bishop's merchants, who arrived with chariots from Kassa (present-day Ko≈°ice, Slovakia) in 1310, when they were attacked and robbed by some members of the local branch of the gens (clan) Gutkeled. After James Borsa and his family turned against Charles I in late 1314 or early 1315, the Diocese of V√°rad was constantly harassed by looting, plundering raids and loss of church property and goods due to attacks of Borsa and their allies, and the subsequent war situation during Charles' royal campaign against the rebellious oligarchs. After the defeat of James Borsa in the Battle of Debrecen, Emeric and several members of his cathedral chapter attended the provincial diet at Szalacs (today SƒÉlacea, Romania) in August 1317, held by royal special judge D√≥zsa Debreceni for the nobles of Bihar, Szabolcs, Szatm√°r, Szolnok and Kraszna counties. =Ecclesiastical affairs= Emeric is first mentioned as Bishop of V√°rad in July 1297, when he confirmed his predecessor Bartholomew's verdict regarding the chapter's right of collection of duties over the aforementioned three villages upon the request of the ecclesiastical body. The cathedral chapter was also granted the one third of the income of the salt mines at Bel√©nyes (present-day Beiu»ô, Romania) by Emeric (the estate and its mines were acquired by one his predecessors Lodomer two decades ago). The bishop provided several tax benefit to the burghers and hospes of V√°rad by reduction of agricultural benefits in 1312. Emeric built and consecrated the St. Andrew Church, a Gothic hall church in Debrecen (present-day the Reformed Great Church stands in that place). According to some historians, the erection of the church was initiated by the illustrious military general D√≥zsa Debreceni or his father, Andrew with the contribution of Emeric. In accordance with the narration of a charter from 1320, Emeric once lost one of the finger relics of St. Ladislaus I of Hungary in the village of H√©v√≠z. A certain Augustinian friar Egyed (Giles) found the relic and donated it to the Pauline monastery of an island of the river Hern√°d (Horn√°d) near K√∂z√©pn√©meti (present- day a borough in Tornyosn√©meti). The monastery, thereafter, became a new place of pilgrimage. Demonstrating his prestige and skills in canon law, Emeric acted as an arbiter in various lawsuit during his service as Bishop of V√°rad. He judged in the long-time dispute of jurisdiction over the sparsely populated M√°ramaros region (today Maramure»ô in Romania) between the dioceses of Eger and Transylvania in 1299. As Andrew, Bishop of Eger did not present at the archbishopric chancellery and Emeric conducted on-site inspections among the local noblemen, who mostly supported Peter Monoszl√≥, King Andrew III decided to donate M√°ramaros to the Diocese of Transylvania. In 1309, Pope Clement V ordered Emeric to protest the interests of Ulrich, rector of the church of N√°das (today Nade»ô, Romania) against the Diocese of Transylvania, who arbitrarily raised the annual tax. In the same year, Emeric, alongside other prelates, requested the pope to hand over the fort of Medvedgrad to its original builder and owner, the Bishopric of Zagreb. Together with five other prelates ‚Äì including John of Nyitra, Nicholas K≈ëszegi of Gy≈ër and Augustin Ka≈æotiƒá of Zagreb ‚Äì Emeric protested against the oligarch Matthew Cs√°k's plundering raids at the expense of the Archdiocese of Esztergom in 1313. The prelates sent a letter to Pope Clement to inform him and urged Matthew Cs√°k to indemnify Archbishop Thomas. Emeric appeared as a witness in the 1309 trial between several churches and chapters in Transylvania and their nominal superior, the Diocese of Transylvania, which then was under the influence of the provincial lord Ladislaus K√°n and his kinship. According to the charges, K√°n prevented the local church officials to visit the papal legate Gentile Portino. During the trial, Emeric did not take a stand on either side , emphasizing that he does not make this confession under duress. Under his episcopate, a certain Demetrius (1294‚Äì1305), then Iv√°nka (1306‚Äì1317; his successor as bishop) served as provost of the cathedral chapter of V√°rad. Before that, Iv√°nka functioned as lector (1294‚Äì1305); he was succeeded by Csan√°d Telegdi (1306‚Äì1317), a future prominent prelate in the 14th-century Hungary. On 12 May 1316, Telegdi was referred to as the vicar and prothonotarius (\\"principal clerk\\") of the elderly Emeric (in 1310, James, archdeacon of B√©k√©s was mentioned in this capacity). Charles I referred to Emeric as a living person on 12 November 1317. The bishop died two days later, on 14 November, according to the official statues of the Diocese of V√°rad.

He has been also a regular Visiting Researcher at Google since 2016. =Research= Youssef's key work focuses on pervasive and mobile computing with a focus on location determination systems and algorithms. His Ph.D. thesis gave the design and implementation of the Horus WLAN location determination system. The Horus system is considered to be one of the earliest WiFi-based tracking systems and the first probabilistic scheme . In 2007, he was the main author of the ACM MobiCom Vision/Challenges paper that introduced the concept of device-free localization (also known as sensor-less sensing), one of the still current hot topics in location tracking research. Traditional tracking techniques require attaching a device to the tracked entity. Device- free localization allows detecting, tracking, and identifying objects without any attachment, by analyzing their effect on the ambient wireless signals. This paradigm-shifting approach for localization opens the door for many novel applications such as intrusion detection, smart homes, ubiquitous gesture- controlled IoT devices, among many others. In 2012, he introduced a vision and system for leveraging crowdsourced phone sensor data to automatically construct indoor floorplans by a building‚Äôs everyday users. This provided a solution to one of the hurdles of ubiquitous indoor localization, but it also sparked follow-on work by others that builds different layers of semantics, e.g. points of interest and place functionalities. This work won the 2013 COMESA Innovation Award. In 2013, he introduced the DejaVu system for providing energy-efficient highly-accurate GPS replacement. GPS-replacement systems usually traded accuracy for energy-efficiency. DejaVu uses the energy- efficient phone sensors to detect virtual landmarks in the physical space that can be used to accurately pinpoint the user location. The results in the paper, that won the best paper award at the ACM SGSpatial'13 conference, show that DejaVu can obtain better accuracy than GPS, while having an order of magnitude saving in energy. DejaVu also won the 2015 COMESA Innovation Award. In 2015, his WiGest gesture recognition system leverages the concept sensor- less sensing to provide a calibration-free high-accuracy gesture recognition system for any Wi-Fi-enabled device. The idea is to leverage the changes in the ambient WiFi signals to detect the gesture the user is performing with her phone. The system can achieve high accuracy without any pre-training. In 2019, his paper in the IEEE Pervasive Computing Magazine extends the concept of sensor-less sensing to include sensing indirectly through the energy harvested from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The key concept is that the motion of persons and their hands will affect the energy harvested from the IoT devices (e.g. those using solar panels) and hence, by analyzing the changes in the harvested energy, one can sense the environment without using and custom sensors. =Awards and honors= In 2019, Youssef became the first computer scientist in the Middle East and Africa to be named a Fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) for his contributions to location tracking algorithms. He was also named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the same year . In 2017, he received the Egyptian State Excellence Award. In 2015, he was named an Distinguished Scientist of the Association of Computing Machinery. In the same year, he also won the COMESA Innovation Award for his DejaVu GPS-replacement technology. Moreover, he received the Alexandria University Commemorative Medal. In 2013, he won the COMESA Innovation Award for his CrowdInside system for the automatic construction of indoor floorplans. He also received the Egyptian Dr. Venice Kamel Gouda's Award for Innovative Technologies. In 2012, he received the Egyptian State Encouragement Award for Engineering Sciences. In 2010, he received the joint TWAS-AAS-Microsoft Award for Young Scientists. In 2004, his thesis work received the Invention of the Year Award from the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1997, he was awarded Prof. Abdelsamie Moustafa award, and Prof. Naim Aboutaleb award from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University for being ranked first on the Faculty of Engineering and the Computer and Systems Engineering Department, respectively. In 1992, he received the Egyptian Ministry of Education Certificate of Honor for being ranked Third Nationwide in the General Secondary School Certificate exam. Media Coverage Youssef's research has attracted the general and technical media. On September 21, 2012, his CrowdInside system for the automatic construction of indoor floorplans was featured in the MIT Technology Review Magazine. On July 2, 2012, his Unloc indoor location determination system was cited in the Scientific American Magazine. On March 10, 2005, his Horus Wi-Fi- based location determination system was cited in the Washington Times Newspaper. Similarly, the Horus system was also cited on June 19 2003 in the New York Times Newspaper. He is also regularly invited on different Egyptian Talk Shows to talk about his research including Al Qahera Al Youm, Nile TV International, Alexandria Satellite Channel, Egyptian National Satellite Channel.

She is an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Anthropology at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She trained as an anthropologist and prehistorian and specialises in the Early Palaeolithic cultures in East Asia, specifically Japan). She is married to Philip E. L. Smith, also an archaeologist, with one son.  Life  Born in Kobe, Japan on 10 September 1930, Fumiko is the eldest daughter of the Buddhist historian, Ikawa Joukei. She studied English at an early age at the suggestion of her mother, a secondary school teacher. She graduated with an undergraduate degree from Tsuada College which subsequently became Tsuda University in 1953 with her thesis on the critical essays by T. S. Elliot. She used her proficiency in English to secure a clerical position with Masao Oka, an ethnologist at the Department of Sociology at Tokyo Metropolitan University and assisted with his lectures and research. This experience led her to resign her position in 1954 in order to study anthropology as a postgraduate student at the same institution. Fumiko focused on the ancient civilisations of Central America which meant that she met Clyde Kluckhohn who in turn introduced her to American anthropology. He was in Japan in order to give a series of seminars on American Studies. This meeting caused her to take a leave of absence and obtain a Fulbright Program to study for a year at Harvard University. Fumiko had intended to specialise in Central American archaeology under Gordon Willey. But once she studied with Hallam Movius she decided to specialise in Early Palaeolithic cultures in [Asia]. She obtained an A. M. in Anthropology, from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA in 1958. In 1959 she married Philip E. L. Smith, an archaeologist interested in prehistory whom she had met at Harvard University. In 1960 they moved to Canada, with their son, as Philip had obtained a teaching job at the University of Toronto, Ontario. She obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1974 with her doctoral thesis on the Early Palaeolithic cultures of Japan.  Career  She accompanied her husband to excavate in Egypt, on the Canadian Expedition to Egyptian Nubia from September 1962 to May 1963. The small group was headed by Philip E.L. Smith, with the title of the ‚ÄúCanadian Expedition to Egyptian Nubia‚Äù, was Canadian government‚Äôs contribution to the International salvage archaeology efforts in connection with the Aswan Dam construction. After spending the summer in Japan, they returned to Toronto for the academic year. Upon their return to Canada when Philip, her husband resumed teaching, she was employed with the Expedition funds as Research Assistant to sort and label artifacts. She subsequently became a Lecturer in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Toronto. She started teaching part-time at McGill University in Montreal in 1966 as her husband, Philip, started to teach at Universit√© de Montr√©al. After a few years of part-time teaching, she was appointed Assistant Professor of Anthropology in 1970, Associate Professor in 1974 and granted tenure. She obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1974 for her dissertation on the Early Palaeolithic cultures of Japan. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1975. A year after she obtained her PhD in 1975, she became the Chair of the Anthropology Department at McGill University. She became Professor in 1979. Fumiko has two strands in her career: a university administrator and a researcher. She was the Chair of the Anthropology Department in 1975, soon after being granted tenure and promoted to Associate Professor. She suspected that she was promoted to Chair as each of the well-established full professors in the department: Peter Gutkind, Richard Anthony Salisbury, and Bruce G. Trigger might try to influence her. She is reported to have said that she thought at the time that each established academic thought he could persuade her to carry out his own agenda, as \\"I was a woman, a Japanese woman at that, who is supposed to be docile. I think I became a chair not \\"in spite of\\" being a woman, but \\"because\\" of being a woman.‚Äù She was Director of the Centre for East Asian Studies at McGill University between 1983 and 1988. She was the Associate Vice-Principal (Academic) of McGill University in 1991 until 1996. This was, at the time, the highest-ranking position a woman had ever been appointed to at McGill University. She later discovered that she obtained the job ‚Äúbecause of‚Äù her gender as the Vice-Principal (Academic), who was a male biologist, was looking for a female humanities person to be his Associate Vice-Principal. She was appointed as Associate Vice-Principal (Academic) in 1991. This position meant that she assisted in the development of both research units by obtaining external grants to add teaching positions in the Centre for East Asian Studies and to invite numerous Visiting Professors from Japan. As Associate Vice-Principal (Academic) part of her duties entailed the creation of academic exchanges and collaboration agreements with universities outside of Canada, strengthening McGill's presence in Asia. She was charged to undertake this task in Asia by then Principal of the University, David Johnston, latterly Governor General of Canada. She helped to establish more than dozen agreements between McGill University and universities in Japan and to create the existing programme for Japanese students to spend the summer at McGill University studying English and Canadian culture. She is research active despite having retired from McGill University in 2003. She held two Visiting Professorships: one at Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan in 1996-1997 and another at El Colegio de M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico in October 2002  Awards  In May 2005 she received the Order of Sacred Treasure with Golden Rays with Rosette at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, for her ‚Äúcontribution towards academic interchange between Japan and Canada, and towards increasing understanding about Japan in Canada.‚Äù She is a founding member of the Japan Studies Association of Canada founded in 1987.

It was released for Windows and Xbox One in early access on July 28, 2020, and is expected to be officially released in 2021. An enhanced version for the Xbox Series X/S is set to release of November 10, 2020. In the game, players are shrunk to the size of an ant and attempt to survive in a backyard filled with dangers. Gameplay Grounded is a survival game that can be played either in first-person or a third-person. In the game, the protagonist is shrunk to the size of an ant and must strive to survive in a backyard. In the game, the player character needs to consume an adequate amount of food and water, or they will lose health due to starvation or dehydration respectively. The backyard is filled with various bugs and insects, such as spiders, bees, dust mites, and ladybugs. Different insects serve different purposes in the game. For instance, spiders are one of the game's apex predators that will hunt down the players, ladybugs can lead players to food sources, and aphids can be cooked and consumed for food. Players can also cut down grass to collect dewdrops. The game has an accessibility option for players who have arachnophobia, which allows players to decide how scary spiders are going to be in the game. As players progress in the game, they will visit new areas in the backyard. The game's difficulty would slowly increase and enemies that are more dangerous would be introduced. Throughout the game, players need to scavenge resources in the world in order to construct a base so as to defend themselves from hostile enemies, in particular during nighttime as some of the insects become more aggressive. The resources can also be used to craft different tools, traps and weapons, such as axes, spears and bows and arrows, to defeat enemies. Players also need to manage their stamina as the playable character may become exhausted in sustained combat. The game can be played solo, though it also has a four- player cooperative multiplayer mode. Story Set in the 1990s, the story follows a group of teens who must unravel the mystery behind why they have been shrunk to the size of an ant. Development Following the release of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, the team at Obsidian Entertainment began brainstorming ideas for a survival game. While the majority of the staff in Obsidian worked on The Outer Worlds, a small team of 13 people began the production of Grounded. The game was already in production before Microsoft's acquisition of Obsidian in 2018. Announced by Xbox Game Studios at X019 in November 2019, the game was released on July 28, 2020 for Steam's early access and Xbox Game Preview. The early version will feature about 20% of the game's main campaign, and Obsidian planned to listen to the feedback from the community as they continued to work towards the game's full release in 2021. The team watched films including A Bug's Life and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids in order to get inspirations. To know more about different types of insects, the team also watched long featurettes at YouTube produced by insect enthusiasts. The team chose the backyard as the game's setting as the team felt that it is a recognizable and approachable location. Also, they believed that a backyard can also be \\"larger-than-life\\" and have a \\"real sense of danger\\". The game's director, Adam Brennecke, compared the setting to a \\"theme park\\", as the team added numerous landmarks into the world in an attempt to make it more interesting. The team envisioned a game world that was interactable, and that players' actions would change the state of the world. Brennecke added that the game would feature a \\"memorable\\" story like other Obsidian's games. The team worked extensively on the artificial intelligence of insects, which govern their behaviors. For instance, ants are curious about the player character and initially do not attack. However, if the player builds a base around their food, or the player character becomes stronger and the ants begin to see them as a threat, they will attack the players.

Morris and Yarkoni also work as consultants for other professionals in the industry. The company employs 40 employees in California, Amsterdam, and Canada.  Background  In 2004, Don Morris and Aaron Yarkoni officially founded DNA Genetics in Amsterdam, where they could legally and commercially produce cannabis after bringing their Californian hybrid strains of cannabis seeds to the Netherlands. In 2015, DNA partnered with Tweed, a subsidiary of Canopy Growth Corporation, to introduce cannabis in Canada. DNA renewed its partnership with Canopy Growth in 2017 to introduce DNA's original strains to Jamaica and other Caribbean markets. The terms of the agreement state that the two companies will work together through 2024. In 2019, DNA Genetics entered into an agreement with Good Meds to bring DNA's strains to Colorado. DNA Genetics and Canopy Growth Corporation have a partnership agreement that brings their products to Canada, Jamaica, and a European market. That same year, the company teamed up with 1933 Industries' subsidiary, Alternative Medicine Association, in a licensing agreement and strategic alliance, to bring their cannabis products to Nevada. Additionally, DNA Genetics signed a licensing agreement with Copperstate Farms LLC to cultivate, manufacture, sell and distribute their products in Arizona. In September 2019, it was announced that DNA Genetics signed a licensing agreement with Revolutionary Clinics, a Massachusetts-based cannabis producer and distributor. In December, the company entered a strategic partnership with Halo Labs, which will be the only grower and manufacturer of DNA Genetics' products in Oregon. That same month, the company partnered with Green Peak Innovations. In January 2020, the company partnered with Bophelo Bioscience & Wellness.  Awards  DNA Genetics has received over 200 awards won in over 15 years. Some of these awards include the High Times Cannabis Cup, which the company has won 14 times, as well as Best Seed Company by online votes at the Happy Place festival. DNA Genetics has also received the High Times Trailer Blazers award, which they received at the world's first Cannabis Business Summit, and listed on both the High Times \\"Top 10 Strains of the Year\\" and the High Times 100 list of most influential people in the cannabis industry.

It was founded in October 2019 by wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales as an alternative to Facebook and Twitter. The service contains no advertisements, and runs on donations. On launch it gained 400,000 users by 3 December 2019. User growth was less rapid thereafter, the number of users being 446,775 on 16 May 2020.  Creation and launch  Jimmy Wales created WT.Social (originally formatted as \\"WT:Social\\") after becoming frustrated with Facebook and Twitter for what he called their \\"clickbait nonsense\\". The format is meant to combat fake news by providing evidence-based news with links and clear sources. Users are able to edit and flag misleading links. WT.Social allows users to share links to news-sites with other users in \\"subwikis\\". Unlike its predecessor (WikiTribune, which Wales co-founded with Orit Kopel), WT.Social was not crowdfunded. Wales was quoted as wanting to \\"keep a tight rein on the costs.\\" In October 2019, Wales launched the site. When a new user signed up they would be placed on a waiting list with thousands of others. To skip the list and gain access to the site, users either had to make a donation or share a link with friends. By November 6, the site had 25,000 users. That number was claimed to be 200,000 by mid- November and 400,000 by December 3. However, this rapid growth was not sustained; the number of users reported as of 15 May 2020 was 446,775.  Subsequent development  Quoted in the Stanford Social Innovation Review for Summer 2020, Wales said: \\"We‚Äôre not doing a good job of actually exposing the best stuff on the platform. So that‚Äôs kind of our next phase in evolution.\\" This approach involved highlighting contributions by public figures. Software As of launch, WT.Social runs on proprietary software, rather than on free software like Mastodon or any other interoperable software based on an open standard like the fediverse. However, as of November 7, 2019, Wales stated that he had just learnt about ActivityPub and was looking into it. Later, Wales stated that the code would be released under GPLv3 in the future.

The \\"Joker Stairs\\" are the colloquial name for a step street connecting Shakespeare and Anderson Avenues at West 167th Street in Highbridge in the Bronx, New York City. Located near the 167th Street station on the New York City Subway's , the stairs served as one of the filming locations in the 2019 film Joker. In the film, Arthur Fleck, the main character, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is repeatedly shown walking up and down these stairs as part of his daily routine. Later, during the film's climax, he dances down the stairs wearing a bright red-colored suit and clown makeup that will come to represent his character of Joker, as Gary Glitter's \\"Rock and Roll Part 2\\" plays in the background. The stairs appear in a promotional poster for the film and have become a tourist destination. Both the stairs and Arthur's dance have become Internet memes. Many visitors reenact the scene from the film, sometimes in Joker attire, to the point that the stairs have become crowded with sightseers. India Today notes, \\"Even though the stairs have been around for years and lead to some of the most famous spots in New York [...] they were never really popular because of their association with crime in the area.\\" The New York Times notes that originally, the stairs used in the 2007 biographical crime film American Gangster, located in a South Bronx neighborhood, were going to be used in the scene, but they had been repaved and beautified too much to be aesthetically acceptable for Joker. NBC New York notes that the Joker Stairs have joined \\"the ranks of well-known movie settings, like that of the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art\\" seen in the 1976 American sports drama Rocky.

Renovatio imperii Romanorum (\\"renewal of the empire of the Romans\\") was a formula declaring an intention to restore or revive the Roman Empire. The formula (and variations) was used by several emperors of the Carolingian and Ottonian dynasties, but the idea was common in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Late Antiquity The phrases renovatio Romanorum (\\"renewal of the Romans\\") and renovatio urbis Romae (\\"renewal of the city of Rome\\") had already been used in Antiquity. The word renovatio (\\"renewal\\") and its relatives, resitutio (\\"restitution\\") and reparatio (\\"restoration\\"), occasionally appeared on Roman coins from the reign of Hadrian onward, usually signifying the restoration of peace following rebellion. The formula seems especially favoured by usurpers, such as Carausius, Magnentius and Decentius. Even Theoderic the Great, the king of the Ostrogoths in Italy (), made use of the language of renewal. The records of his reign in Cassiodorus, Ennodius and the Anonymus Valesianus are replete with reference to renewing, repairing and rejuvenating. Under the Emperor Justinian I (), renewal was closely linked with the restoration of the empire's frontiers by reconquest. This policy appealed to the Roman aristocracy and to such writers as Procopius and John Lydus, who wrote in his De magistratibus: \\"To Rome Justinian restored what was Rome's.\\" This was not enough for the poet Corippus, who saw the end of Justinian's reign as a period of reckless spending and neglect. His poerm In Laudem Iustini Augusti Minoris takes as its theme the renewal of the empire under Justin II. Middle Ages The form renovatio Romanorum imperii was first used in a diploma issued by Charlemagne, who was crowned emperor in 800. He was probably inspired, at least in part, by Roman coins. Evidence for the \\"renewal\\" of the city of Rome under Charlemagne comes largely from the Liber pontificalis. There were major building and renovation programmes under Popes Hadrian I and Leo III, and there is also evidence for population growth and an increase in Christian pilgrimage traffic. Charlemagne's successor, Louis the Pious, dropped the formula in favour of a new one: renovatio regni Francorum (\\"renewal of the kingdom of the Franks\\"). When Louis's younger son, Charles the Bald, became emperor in 875 he adopted the combined formula renovatio imperii Romani et Francorum for his seal. The formula renovatio imperii Romanorum reappears on a lead seal of the Emperor Otto III in August 998. This seal was replaced in January 1001 by one bearing the legend aurea Roma (\\"golden Rome\\"). Otto III also built a palace in Rome, which none of his predecessors had done. Otto III's use of the formula has been made to bear much historical weight in light of his enigmatic career and politics. The historian Percy Ernst Schramm argued that the formula represented a coherent programme for the restoration of the Roman Empire along secular and universal lines. Knut G√∂rich has written a riposte to Schramm's thesis, arguing instead that Otto III and Pope Gregory V were embarking on a renewal of the papacy only. The idea of the renewal of Rome the city (renovatio Romae), of the empire (renovatio imperii) and of Roman virtue (renovatio morum) were intertwined in early Italian humanist thinking. The Roman popular leader Cola di Rienzo believed that the renewal of the empire would be brought about by through popular sovereignty and not the Holy Roman Emperors. Most humanists, like Dante and Petrarch, believed that the renewal of imperial authority in Italy would precede the renewal of the city and encouraged Kings Henry VII and Charles IV to make the journey to Rome for imperial coronation.

It proposed to alter the Australian constitution so that both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be elected for a term of four years. This involved reducing the terms of the Senate from six years to four years, and increasing the terms of the House of Representatives from three years to four years. It also proposed for the fourth time that Senate and House elections occur simultaneously. Question A Proposed Law: To alter the Constitution to provide for 4 year maximum terms for members of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. Do you approve this proposed alteration? The proposal was to alter sections of the Constitution to read as follows: > 7\\\\. The Senate :The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, > directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament > otherwise provides, as one electorate. :But until the Parliament of the > Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, > if that State be an Original State, may make laws dividing the State into > divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each > division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one > electorate. :Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six > senators for each Original State. The Parliament may make laws increasing or > diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so that equal > representation of the several Original States shall be maintained and that > no Original State shall have less than six senators. :The ~~senators shall > be chosen for a term of six years, and the~~ names of the senators chosen > for each State shall be certified by the Governor to the Governor-General. > 9\\\\. Method of election of senators :The Parliament of the Commonwealth may > make laws prescribing the method of choosing senators, but so that the > method shall be uniform for all the States. Subject to any such law, the > Parliament of each State may make laws prescribing the method of choosing > the senators for that State. :Times and places :: ~~The Parliament of a > State may make laws for determining the times and places of elections of > senators for the State.~~ 12\\\\. Issue of writs :The Governor of any State may > cause writs to be issued for elections of senators for the State. ~~In case > of the dissolution of the Senate the writs shall be issued within ten days > from the proclamation of such dissolution.~~ The writs shall be issued > within ten days from the expiry of a House of Representatives or from the > proclamation of a dissolution thereof, but so that the polling day shall be > the same day as the polling day for the election of members of the House of > Representatives. ~~13\\\\. Rotation of senators~~ : ~~As soon as may be after > the Senate first meets, and after each first meeting of the Senate following > a dissolution thereof, the Senate shall divide the senators chosen for each > State into two classes, as nearly equal in number as practicable; and the > places of the senators of the first class shall become vacant at the > expiration of three years, and the places of those of the second class at > the expiration of six years, from the beginning of their term of service; > and afterwards the places of senators shall become vacant at the expiration > of six years from the beginning of their term of service.~~ : ~~The election > to fill vacant places shall be made within one year before the places are to > become vacant.~~ : ~~For the purposes of this section the term of service of > a senator shall be taken to begin on the first day of July following the day > of his election, except in the cases of the first election and of the > election next after any dissolution of the Senate, when it shall be taken to > begin on the first day of July preceding the day of his election.~~ ~~14\\\\. > Further provision for rotation~~ : ~~Whenever the number of senators for a > State is increased or diminished, the Parliament of the Commonwealth may > make such provision for the vacating of the places of senators for the State > as it deems necessary to maintain regularity in the rotation.~~ 13\\\\. Terms > of service of senators. :(1) The terms of service of senators expire upon > the expiry or dissolution of the House of Representatives. :(2) Subsection > (1) applies in relation to the term of service of any senator, including: > ::(a) a senator holding office at the commencement of this section; and > ::(b) a senator chosen or appointed after that commencement in consequence > of a vacancy existing at that commencement; :but, in the case of a senator > appointed by the Governor of a State, this section does not extend the term > of the appointment after the expiration of 20 fourteen days from the > beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State following the > making of the appointment. 28\\\\. Duration of House of Representatives :Every > House of Representatives shall continue for ~~three years~~ four years from > the first meeting of the House, and no longer, but may be sooner dissolved > by the Governor-General. :In relation to a House of Representatives whose > first meeting occurred before the commencement of the Constitution > Alteration (Parliamentary Terms) 1988, the last preceding paragraph has > effect as if the reference to four years were a reference to three years.

Lau said \\"As a Chinese woman, and the youngest girl in my family, I was told that there were many limitations on what I could achieve. My parents did not have very high expectations and told me that I did not have to work very hard...I was told by my teacher that I should pursue my studies in the arts, but I did not have the resources to do so....It took me nearly 20 years to recognise my own abilities.\\" Lau graduated with a degree in Graphic Design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 1990. Lau also graduated with a master's degree from the University of Leeds.  Career  She became involved in activist causes, including becoming a chairperson of Hong Kong's Association for the Advancement of Feminism, which spoke out about sexist imagery in television advertisements and hosted a mock awards night for the most sexist ads. She turned from feminist essays to cartoons when asked by an academic to produce cartoons for a gender and sexuality journal. Lau said \\"People in Hong Kong don't like reading more than 1,000 words. So if you want them to see your work, you do comics.\\" In 1998, Lau began drawing the comic strip Lily's Comix, which appeared initially in Hong Kong Film Weekly and later in mainstream newspapers like in the Hong Kong Economic Journal, The Sun, and Apple Daily. The strip was controversial and noted for its \\"graphic nudity and sexual frankness\\".

USC Dornsife. Early life and education Born in Berlin- Wilmersdorf, Barnouw's family became refugees during World War II after Dresden was bombed. In an essay written just before she died, she recalled: \\"Packed tightly into an open truck, we clutched our small wet bundles, ourselves shaken like rags by the cold wind and the fear of being flung off the truck. It stopped abruptly; our eyes shut against the heavy rain opened; we looked at the village and knew that it would always have been cut off from the rest of the world. All hopes of leaving here would be nothing but a hazy dream; and trying to get back to where we had come from nothing but a black rock of futility.\\"Barnouw, Dagmar (2008). \\"Almost Memories / Almost True Stories\\". German Quarterly. The family was eventually resettled in Ulm in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Barnouw completed her first degree in Germany and in 1962 was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study at Stanford University. In 1968 she obtained a PhD from Yale University for a thesis on the German poet Eduard M√∂rike. This became her first book, Entz√ºckte Anschauung Sprache und Realit√§t in der Lyrik Eduard M√∂rikes (1971). Career =Positions held= In 1977 she became an associate professor at Purdue University, then taught at several universities in the United States and Germany, including Brown University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of California, San Diego, Heidelberg University, and the University of Pittsburgh.

She argued against the idea that the Holocaust should be regarded as unique and in some sense ahistorical.Stewart, Jocelyn Y. (24 May 2008). \\"Professor wrote on post-WWII guilt, suffering\\".

Germanic- studies scholar William Rasch referred to three of her books‚ÄîVisible Spaces, Germany 1945, and The War in the Empty Air‚Äîas her \\"Arendt trilogy\\"; the polemics reminded him of Hannah Arendt. Reviewing The War in the Empty Air, political scientist Manfred Henningsen noted Barnouw's \\"barely contained anger\\". Barnouw wrote: That the Holocaust and Auschwitz were regarded as \\"unique\\" was understandable in the early post-war years, she wrote, but in the longer term the unquestioned view of World War II as the \\"good, clean war\\" and the \\"absolutely just war\\" has continued to further Allied interests, particularly American interests. She argued for a reappraisal. The war was fought as if there were \\"no limits to the destruction of humans\\".

An individual‚Äôs discretionary income could increase as a result of increased income or decreased cost, such as paying off a mortgage. As discretionary income increases, individuals are able spend money on things that were previously unaffordable. Lifestyle creep occurs when spending increases at the same rate as income. It can be reflected in purchases, such as expensive vehicles or a second home. Spending money on things with ongoing maintenance costs, such as club memberships, also are demonstrated in lifestyle creep. Lifestyle creep tends to be insidious, so it can be difficult to realize it is occurring. This is why some experts have called it a ‚Äúsilent inflation‚Äù. Although it is difficult to perceive, it can be contagious as people compare their own lifestyle with others. Signs of lifestyle creep could include difficulty saving money and increasing debt. Making a budget and setting a limit on expenses could potentially limit lifestyle creep. This phenomenon is common among young adults in their mid- twenties to early thirties. In this age group, rapid career advancements lead to more discretionary income which can lead to excess spending. It can also become a particular problem near the age of retirement, where individuals tend to have the highest earning potential and decreased costs, such as not having the financial burden of raising children. When individuals retire and try to maintain a formerly lavish lifestyle, they can suffer financially. Furthermore, it is challenging to downgrade lifestyle.

Description  This aquatic plant is perennial and flowers through late June until late November. Ludwigia pilosa is pubescent all over and sometimes described as velvety. The stem can measure up to 1.2 meters tall with alternating leaves. Leaves are simple and attached at the petiole. Leaves are also elliptical shaped, gauging roughly 20 - 100 mm in length and 3-14 mm in width. The flowers are characterized by no petals but having 4-7 yellow sepals averaging 4-5 mm long. Ludwigia pilosa is plentiful in seeds measuring 0.5mm and incapsulated in a dry seed pod. The seed box in cubed shaped with a thick exterior and estimates 3-4 mm in length. Ludwigia pilosa has proven to be a very resourceful plant. Waterfowl feed on the seeds of the hairy primrose-willow and the immersed portion creates habitat for many invertebrates. Once the plants start to decay, the detritus then sustains the invertebrates also.  Habitat and distribution  Ludwigia pilosa prefers wet ground and can be found along road side ditches, ponds, and shallow swampy areas. Distribution spreads from eastern TX to the southern half of MS, AL, GA, NC, SC, the northern portion of FL, and two counties in southeastern VA.

It has smooth, mottled grey bark, narrow lance- shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup- shaped to hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus nudicaulis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mottled grey to silvery bark. Yount plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and leaves arranged alternately, long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull, greyish green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and about wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering occurs between February and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus nudicaulis was first formally described in 1991 by Anthony Bean and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya from a specimen collected north of Mount Isa. The specific epithet (nudicaulis) is derived from the Latin nudus meaning \\"naked\\" or \\"bare\\" and caulis meaning \\"stem\\", referring to the smooth bark of this species. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt grows on quartzite ridges, in rocky gullies and on steep hillsides in a small area near Mount Isa and Cloncurry. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. It is only known from about six small populations.

It served to emphasise the importance of the ethnic Franks and the Frankish tradition in the multinational empires of the Carolingians and Ottonians. It may have been used as early as 813 by Charlemagne, but it was definitely used by his successor as emperor, Louis the Pious, on a metal seal during his religious reforms. It originally referred to the internal religious renewal of the Frankish empire. The motto was used only sporadically by the later Carolingians. Louis's younger son, Charles the Bald, put it on his coins early in his reign probably to appeal to the ethnically Frankish nobility of his kingdom. After he became emperor in 875, he combined on his new seal his father's formula with that of his grandfather, renovatio Romanorum imperii (\\"renewal of the empire of the Romans\\"), to create a new motto: renovatio imperii Romani et Francorum. The motto renovatio regni Francorum was used again by the emperors Charles the Fat (881‚Äì888), Guy (891‚Äì894), Lambert (892‚Äì898) and Arnulf (896‚Äì899). Between 1003 and 1007, King Henry II of Germany resurrected the motto for his own program of religious reform. He was also asserting his connection with the Carolingian past and the parity of the German kingdom with the Byzantine Empire. Henry used it from his election as king of Germany and before he had been crowned emperor in Rome. He was the first non-emperor to use the motto and by doing so clearly expressed the \\"imperial\\" nature of the German kingship. Traditionally, Henry II's adoption of this motto has been seen as a conscious break with his predecessor, Otto III, who had favoured Charlemagne's motto renovatio Romanorum imperii. The idea that this change of motto indicated an abrupt change of governing program has been questioned.

It was one of the first high rise developments in Brisbane in the Modernist style.  History  Glenfalloch Apartments is a residential building designed by Lund, Hutton, Newell, Black and Paulsen and completed in 1962 at a cost of ¬£750,000.. It was developed by Stanley Korman and built by J.D Booker Constructions, who also developed Kinkabool in Surfers Paradise. It overlooks the Brisbane River. The site was previously the home of the Merthyr Bowls Club and Limbless Soldiers Bowl Club until it was sold. It was the first high rise in New Farm. It is listed on the Brisbane City Council Heritage Register. Glenfalloch is 15 storeys tall, accessible via a lift and stairwells that protrude from its rectangular structure. It features two under building garages. It consists of 98 apartments, primarily two bedroom units, with penthouses on the top and one bedroom units on each side of its structure. To safeguard the building from flood, each of its two driveways leading to the garages have two metre high side walls. The apartments face north to take advantage of solar benefits, rather than river views. It is unique in that 60% of the land on which it sits is dedicated garden and outdoor living space leading to the river. Modern improvements to the fa√ßade include new glazed aluminium, new windows, doors and balustrades. During the 1974 and 2011 floods which affected Brisbane, residents sandbagged the garage and driveway areas preventing the flooding of lower level apartments. Plans of the designs for Glenfalloch are held in the University of Queensland Fryer Library.

The spiritual successor to 1990's Out Zone, it is notable for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. Set in a future where an alien race known as the Gozzu from the fictional planet Fortuna invaded the universe, players are tasked by the Galactic Federation government with an extermination mission against the invaders by assuming the role of one of the eight mercenaries. As of 2019, the rights to FixEight is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. FixEight is a science fiction-themed vertically scrolling run and gun game similar to Out Zone, where players assume the role of one of the eight playable mercenaries through seven increasingly difficult stages, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in an effort to exterminate the invading Gozzu alien race on planet Fortuna as the main objective. Players fight enemies on foot and move upward through the level. The players are also equipped with a number of \\"X\\" bombs capable of any enemy caught in its blast radius at the start, rendering players invincible for a brief period of time after using a bomb and the player's stock is refilled with \\"B\\" icons.FixEight arcade flyer (Toaplan, JP)FixEight manual (Toaplan, EU) Returning from Out Zone is its weapon system, albeit modified; Players are equipped with two main weapons at the beginning that can be upgraded by picking up \\"P\\" icons and switch between them at will by standind below a change panel but unlike its predecessor, each character has their own weapon set, as well as their own special weapon that is acquired through a \\"?\\" icon. Grabbing the \\"?\\" icon after obtaining the special weapon grants other attributes such as increasing the character's overall speed or shield. Other items like gold bars and gold statues can also be picked up for points. Omitted from its predecessor is the energy bar system where player had to remain aware of their depleting energy level. If a single player is downed, their character is immediately respawned at the location they died at, unlike its predecessor's checkpoint system. Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against solid stage obstacles or falling off the stage will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the characters' firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with the second loop increasing the difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns, in addition to spawning extra bullets when destroyed (sometimes called 'suicide bullets' or 'ricochet effect'). Defeating the second loop results in being sent back to the first stage, starting the third loop.  Synopsis  = Plot = FixEight takes place in a future where an alien race known as the Gozzu from the planet Fortuna have invaded the universe, prompting the Galactic Federation government with releasing a group of eight mercenaries from their imprisonment in an asteroid prison and sending them to Fortuna with the task of exterminating the invaders alongside their planet. = Characters = * Howard Young: A North American war veteran who was confined to prison and contracted a disease. * GX-026: An android who single-handedly obliterated 26 planets across the galaxy in one year. * Vistario: A lizard-like space pirate from the Oligo star. * Agatha Bordeaux: A former Italian supermodel warrior who was jailed for treason.

Development and release  FixEight was released in arcades in July 1992. Despite sharing the same gameplay mechanics, Out Zone composer Tatsuya Uemura stated in a 2017 podcast that FixEight was not directly related to its predecessor, although he and members of the original team had no involvement during development. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). According to former Toaplan designer Junya Inoue, FixEight was designed by Nanpei Kaneko, a member who would later work on Knuckle Bash before quitting the company and work as illustrator for Japanese magazines. (Translation by Gamengai. ). The soundtrack was composed by Toshiaki Tomizawa. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). On October 21, 1992, an album was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon, featuring an arranged song composed by Tomizawa. A promotional recording sent by Toaplan to arcade operators also features an arranged song not present in the 1992 album.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, Game Machine listed FixEight on their September 1, 1992 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as X-Men. In the November 1992 issue of Japanese publication Micom BASIC Magazine, the game was ranked on the number six spot in popularity. Nick Zverloff of Hardcore Gaming 101 gave positive remarks to FixEight in regards to several improvements made over its predecessor and regarded it as \\"one of the most improved sequels Toaplan ever made\\".

Gisangdo is a satirical poem that compared the volatile state of international affairs in the 1930s to the development of a typhoon. The poem has been lauded as a prime example of the modernism of Kim Kirim, a man who attempted to imbue his poems with an awareness of modern civilization.  Overview  = Structure = Gisangdo is composed of 7 sections and 424 lines. Each section is labeled with titles that follow the progression of a typhoon: Segyeui achim (ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏùò ÏïÑÏπ® Morning of the World), Siminhaengnyeol (ÏãúÎØºÌñâÎ†¨ Citizen Parade), Taepungui gichim sigan (ÌÉúÌíçÏùò Í∏∞Ïπ® ÏãúÍ∞Ñ Rising Time of the Typhoon), Jachwi (ÏûêÏ∑® Tracks), Byeongdeun punggyeong (Î≥ëÎì† ÌíçÍ≤Ω A Diseased Landscape), Olppaemiui jumun (Ïò¨ÎπºÎØ∏Ïùò Ï£ºÎ¨∏ Owl's Incantation), and Soebakwiui norae (Ïá†Î∞îÌÄ¥Ïùò ÎÖ∏Îûò Song of an Iron Wheel). The 7 sections are further divided into 3 parts, according to time. Sections 1 through 3 depict the time before the typhoon's arrival, sections 4 through 6 depict the typhoon as it ravages the land, and section 7 shows the time after the typhoon has passed.Kwon, Youngmin. Unabridged Dictionary of Modern Korean Literature. Seoul National University Press, 2004. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=334548&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737 = Summary of each section= In section 1, Segyeui achim, before the typhoon begins, the atmosphere is light-hearted and hopeful. However, in section 2, Siminhaengnyeol, the narrator senses the unease around the world in places such as China, America, France, and Korea. Then in section 3, Taepungui gichim sigan, warnings come that a typhoon has made its approach, and descriptions of the typhoon are given through dialogue. Section 4, Jachwi, depicts the scenes of chaos caused by the typhoon as churches, libraries, brothels, and roads fall into disarray. Section 5, Byeongdeun punggyeong, also shows a series of devastated landscapes in the wake of the typhoon. Section 6, Olppaemiui jumun, depicts the despair, grief, and sorrow brought about by the typhoon. And finally, a day after the typhoon has passed in section 7, Soebakwiui norae, a new sun rises and the poem sings of the will and hope of life once again.Kwon, Youngmin. Unabridged Dictionary of Modern Korean Literature. Seoul National University Press, 2004. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=334548&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737 = Subject and style = Gisangdo criticizes modern society through the image of a charging typhoon. In particular, the poem satirizes the fascism and imperialism of the 1930s by comparing the volatile state of international affairs to a volatile climate.Kang, Jinho et al. Unpacking Modern Korean Literature. National Library of Korea Information Center for Modern Literature, 2015. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=4353831&cid;=60550&categoryId;=63761 Kim Kirim, who was a journalist before he became a poet, actively brought into his poems the various pieces of knowledge he acquired through working in the editorial department.Kim, You-joong. ‚ÄúThe Subject of Gisangdo and the Meaning of ‚ÄòTyphoon.‚Äô‚Äù Korean Poetic Studies 52 (2017). Kim Kirim also included elements‚Äîsuch as the names of foreign flowers, the international harbors, transcontinental trans, world maps, and foreign consulates‚Äîthat signaled to the reader that a new era had arrived. These characteristics show us the modernist side of Kim Kirim and a man who attempted to address the changing times.Encyclopedia of Korean Culture http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0008274 = Context = Gisangdo was heavily influenced by T.S. Elliot's The Waste Land. T.S. Elliot's name appears frequently in Kim Kirim's writings on poetry, which Kim Kirim wrote in 1936 in Japan before he began studying I.A. Richards‚Äô theories on poetry. In the author's note, there are passages that remind one of Elliot's The Waste Land. For example, Kim Kirim revealed that he wanted to mix every aspect of modern civilization to make a piece that was like a symphony, and this can be compared to the way in which T.S. Elliot injected parts of Wagner's symphonies into The Waste Land. Gisangdo and The Waste Land also draw similarities in the sense that they are both long poems that critically view the rise and fall of civilization. Of course, that is not to say that there are not many differences between the two poems. Whereas The Waste Land is set in London, the center of imperialism, Gisangdo is set on the peripheries of imperialism, specifically in colonial Seoul and semi-colonial Shanghai. Likewise, Gisangdo reimagines the rise and fall of civilization‚Äîwhich was visualized in Europe by The Waste Land‚Äîthrough the imagery of East Asia in the 1930s.Kim, Hanseong. ‚ÄúComparing Gisangdo (1936) and The Waste Land (1922) ‚Äì Focusing on the Intertextuality of Wheel.‚Äù Journal of Korean Modern Literature 38 (2012).  Critical reception  By depicting the state of contemporary international affairs in such grand scale, and by using colorful rhetoric and many modern techniques, Gisangdo garnered the attention of critics. Interest in the work, however, did not necessarily result in positive reception. While critics acknowledged the importance of such an ambitious work, they raised doubt concerning the conceptual depth and thematic integrity of the work. This doesn't change the fact, however, that there is great literary historical significance in Kim Kirim's attempt to express awareness of civilization and modern history through the form of a long poem.Kim, You-joong. ‚ÄúThe Subject of Gisangdo and the Meaning of ‚ÄòTyphoon.‚Äô‚Äù Korean Poetic Studies 52 (2017). Korean poetry at the time had the sentimental tendency of wallowing in the gloomy atmosphere of the period; Kim Kirim, however, saw such a tendency as a feudalistic element to be overcome and attempted to create poetry that was suitable for modern times. Gisangdo asks the question of what kind of world poets should construct while standing on a waste land in which one can no longer sing in harmony with songs of the past. In this sense, as noted by one critic, Gisangdo presents both the problem of the times that modernist poets of Korea in the 1930s had to face, and the literary exploration of that problem.Son, Jong-eop. ‚ÄúGolden Leaf‚Äôs Modernity ‚Äì The Social Location and Re- evaluation of Kim Kirim‚Äôs Poetry.‚Äù Journal of Language and Literature 44 (2010).  Cover art  Of all the books of poetry published during the Japanese colonial period, none have been more highly praised for their modernist cover art as Gisangdo. The person who decorated the front of the Gisangdo was Yi Sang, another famous Korean poet. Kim Kirim and Yi Sang were both members of The Circle of Nine, a literary society formed in 1933 by Korean authors, and were close friends. At the age of 21, Yi Sang was hired as an architect at the offices of the Government General of Korea and won a design competition for the same office, proving his sense for design.Kwon, Young-min. Unabridged Dictionary of Modern Korean Literature. Seoul National University Press, 2004. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=334548&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737 In this way, the artistic sensibilities of two of Korea's most acclaimed modernists of the 1930s are at play in Gisangdo. On the other hand, despite the fact he designed the cover for Gisangdo, Yi Sang was himself unable to publish a book of poetry before his death in 1937. It was none other than Kim Kirim who planned and wrote a foreword for Yi Sang's poems which were published posthumously in 1949 under the title Yi Sang Seonjib (Ïù¥ÏÉÅÏÑ†Ïßë Selected Works of Yi Sang).Kang, Jinho et al.

Mohammed, who escaped a forced, abusive marriage to an Al-Qaeda operative, became an advocate for women's rights through her non-profit organization Free Hearts, Free Minds. She is a member of the Center for Inquiry Speaker's Bureau and on the board of advisory for the Brighter Brains Institute. Mohammed runs a website named Confessions of an Ex-Muslim. Through her initiative Free Hearts, Free Minds she supports closeted ex-Muslims from Muslim-majority countries and co-ordinates an online campaign called #NoHijabDay against World Hijab Day. Mohammed has been interviewed by Sam Harris, Seth Andrews, and several news outlets from multiple countries, and in 2019 self-published the book Unveiled: How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. Family and early life Mohammed's mother is Egyptian, the niece of former President Mohammed Naguib and her father is Palestinian. Mohammed was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and the family lived a secular life until her father left when she was two, leaving her mother with three young children. The family lived a secular life until her father left when Mohammed was two, leaving the mother with three young children. Mohammed's mother sought community and support from a local mosque, where she met a man who said he would support her. He was already married, with three of his own children, but she became his second wife. Mohammed was nine at the time. Mohammed states that her mother's situation improved, since her new husband was not abusive towards her like her first husband was. However, Mohammed states in an interview with Sam Harris that her step-father was physically abusive towards her and her siblings. Her mother became a born-again Muslim, which changed Mohammed's life. She was no longer permitted to go outside to play with her friends and she had to pray five times per day. She was forced to wear a hijab and was beaten for failing to memorize the Quran. She started attending an Islamic school that was established in the mosque. When she was 13, she told a trusted teacher about the abuse she was experiencing and showed him her bruises. The police were called and the case went to court, but Mohammed states that the judge ruled that because her family was Arab, they had the right to discipline her in that manner. She states that it made her feel that she didn't matter as much as other children. She has often described the way she was raised as \\"evil\\". Mohammed started wearing the niqƒÅb at the age of 19, after being introduced to her future husband. =Forced marriage to an Al-Qaeda operative= When Mohammed was 20, she was forced to marry a member of Al- Qaeda, and had a daughter with him. Mohammed later escaped the marriage to protect her daughter from the threat of female genital mutilation. She changed their names and moved to a different city, as she was worried that her daughter would be kidnapped and raised a Muslim. Even though she believed her husband was in prison she remained frightened because he was a member of Al- Qaeda. Following her escape, she secured student loans and attended the University of British Columbia, where she took a history of religion class and started to examine Islam more critically for the first time. Activism Mohammed decided to start speaking out after she watched Ben Affleck and Sam Harris debate Islam on Real Time with Bill Maher. She has criticized both Islam and the left - that she accuses of inadvertently enabling radical Islam through their work to fight Islamophobia. Mohammed is a vocal opponent to the practice of wearing a hijab, as well as attempts to promote its use. To protest against World Hijab Day, Mohammed promoted the hashtag #NoHijabDay on social media, viewing the hijab as \\"a tool of oppression ‚Äì a garment that perpetuates rape culture\\". Mohammed also raised money to accommodate Rahaf Mohammed, an asylum seeker who fled to Canada from Saudi Arabia to escape her abusive family. According to Erich J. Prince, Mohammed has become a frequent commentator on Islam's relationship with the West, particularly in Canada. According to the Jerusalem Post, Mohammed is a significant voice in the ex- Muslim community, speaking to audiences worldwide. =Free Hearts, Free Minds= Mohammed founded a non-profit organization called, Free Hearts, Free Minds that helps ex-Muslims living in Muslim-majority countries with state- sanctioned death penalties for leaving Islam. The organization provides psychological counselling for people leaving Islam, especially focusing on providing services to women from Saudi Arabia and LGBT individuals from the Muslim world. Publication Mohammed wrote a memoir titled Unveiled: How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. that was self-published on 25 September 2019. She received two years of rejection letters before being convinced by Sam Harris to self-publish. The memoir outlines her upbringing in a fundamentalist, Islamic household in Canada, her step-father beating the bottoms of her feet for not reciting her prayers correctly, being married against her will to an Al-Qaeda operative, her escape and subsequent activism. In an interview with Seth Andrews, host of The Thinking Atheist podcast, Andrews questioned her choice of title. Because not all western liberals empower radical Islam, he thought the title could have been Unveiled: How Many Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. Mohammed responded that a more accurate title for the book could have been How Some Western Liberals Unintentionally Empower Radical Islam but this would not have captured sufficient attention. Personal life Mohammed has remarried and has two daughters, one from her first marriage and one from her second. She severed ties with her mother after her mother threatened to kill her because she wouldn't wear her Hijab any more and because she had become a non-believer.

The Collation of the New Testament compares four Latin texts of Jerome‚Äôs fourth- century Vulgate Bible with four Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Valla designated the Greek text the Graeca veritas or \\"Greek truth\\", that is the truth of the original Greek. Background The Vulgate had become the predominant Bible translation by 800 AD and thousands of handwritten copies of the text were circulated throughout Europe; however, these were produced with numerous errors despite efforts made by medieval scholars to correct the text. Previous to Valla's work, medieval scholars such as Roger Bacon and Nicholas of Lyra had completed similar scriptural comparisons and advocated study of the Bible's original Hebrew and Greek text. The revival of Greek studies in Western Europe and the Vulgate's prominence in the cultural milieu of the continent and its status as the authoritative version of the Bible made it an especially desirable work for humanists to critically examine. Overview The Collation of the New Testament was Valla's first comparative study of the original Greek New Testament and the Vulgate, with his Annotations of the New Testament being a subsequent though ultimately uncompleted project he dedicated himself to during the mid-1450s; by the end of his life, Valla had completed approximately 2,000 notes on the New Testament. Valla employed humanist philological methods to compare the texts, including favouring the ad sententiam approach against the older medieval ad verbum convention; the former approach critically assessed a word's history and development while the latter convention freely translated between Greek and Latin on a word-for-word basis. By examining the Vulgate's style, vocabulary, and grammar, Valla was able to draw out faulty translations that had obscured the Latin Bible's meaning and other erratum due to copier error. For instance, Valla challenged the Vulgate's translation of the Greek word ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ± as \\"penance\\" rather than \\"repentance\\" and also contended that Jerome had not translated the Vulgate. Valla's analysis of the Vulgate led to criticisms from his fellow humanist Poggio Braccciolini who objected to his tampering with the authoritative Latin text but Valla's work was commended by Cardinal Basilios Bessarion and Nicholas of Cusa. In response to Bracciolini's criticisms Valla responded: > \\"if I am correcting anything, I am not correcting Sacred Scripture, but > rather its translation, and in doing so I am not being insolent toward > scripture but rather pious, and I am doing nothing more than translating > better than the earlier translator, so that it is my translation‚Äîshould it > be correct‚Äîthat ought to be called Sacred Scripture, not his.\\" Valla, like other philologists, thus saw his efforts to assess the accuracy of the Vulgate as an act of service to theology. Although Valla‚Äôs work was limited, it nevertheless represents one of the first attempts to comprehensively collate and evaluate the variants present between Greek manuscripts of the New Testament and the Vulgate. Influence Valla‚Äôs Collation of the New Testament is perhaps most significant for being a major influence on the Dutch Christian humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466-1536), who came across Valla‚Äôs work in mid-1504 in a library near Louvain and who subsequently published Valla's previously-unreleased collation the next year. Valla's collation helped to convince Erasmus that there was an interest in a new translation of the New Testament and Erasmus would write his own translation, drawing upon the scholarship of Valla, which he released in 1516. Other scholars influenced by Valla include the group gathered by Cardinal Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros at Alcal√° who worked on the Complutensian Polyglot Bible in the early 1500s.

Eulhwa was adapted from Kim Dong-ri‚Äôs 1936 short story ‚ÄúMunyeodo‚Äù (Î¨∏ÎÖÄÎèÑ The Way of the Shaman) and was published by Munhaksasang in 1978. Through depicting the life of a woman whose fate turns her to the path of a Shaman, Eulhwa explores the struggles between traditional Korean mysticism and modern rationalism.Encyclopedia of Korean Culture http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%EC%9D%84%ED%99%94&ridx;=0&tot;=1  Summary  Set in a rural Korean village in Gyeongju in the 1920s, Eulhwa depicts the life story of a woman named Okseon. Living with her single mother, Okseon is raised in a poor household. When she is 16, Okseon forms a relationship with the neighbor, Seongchul, and has a son named Yeongsul. Okseon leaves the child to her mother to be raised and is forced to marry an old man, but soon thereafter, her aged husband and Okseon‚Äôs mother die in quick succession, leaving Okseon alone to raise Yeongsul. One day, Yeongsul becomes sick. Afraid the sickness may kill him, Okseon seeks the help of the village Shaman, Bbakji. The shaman performs a gut (exorcism) and Yeongsul is cured. But it is not long before Okseon also becomes ill. Bbakji returns and performs the Sinnerim‚Äîa ritual to endow a deity to a person destined to become a Shaman‚Äîand leads Okseon on the path to Shaman-hood, giving her the new name of Eulhwa (transliterated as Ulhwa in the official English translation, see below). Okseon, with her new name, meets a man named Pangdol, and the two of them live together raising Yeongsul. Eulhwa and Pangdol eventually have another child between the two of them: a daughter named Wolhui. Once Yeongsul is old enough, Eulhwa sends him to study at a Buddhist temple. While Yeongsul is away from home, he becomes a devout Christian. At the same time, Eulhwa becomes a famous Shaman; this, however, does not save her from a life of poverty. When Yeongsul returns to the village, he intends to provide salvation to his mother and younger sister through the Christian faith. Eulhwa, however, fights against her son‚Äôs attempt to spread the gospel. She begins reciting incantations, vowing to rid her house of Jesus‚Äôs ghost, and burns her son‚Äôs bible. And as Yeongsul attempts to stop his mother from doing this, he falls onto her knife and dies. After Eulhwa performs funeral rites for her son, Pangdol takes Wolhui and leaves Eulhwa.  ‚ÄúMunyeodo‚Äù and Eulhwa  The short story ‚ÄúMunyeodo‚Äù, published in May of 1936 in JoongAng, is one of Kim Dong- ri‚Äôs earliest works. Kim Dong-ri was known to have been fond of this work, and as such, attempted adapting it several times. Eulhwa, published in 1978, is the forty-two-year culmination of these efforts at adaption into a full-length novel. Part of the reason Kim Dong-ri continued to return to ‚ÄúMunyeodo‚Äù was because of the time in which he wrote the work and the issues he was concerned with at that time. Kim Dong-ri wrote ‚ÄúMunyeodo‚Äù during the Japanese colonial period, and at that time, he was searching for the most fundamental aspect of the Korean people, a group whose very existence was being threatened by Japanese colonialism and assimilationist policies. Kim Dong-ri‚Äôs answer to this question was not Confucianism nor Buddhism, but Korean Shamanism, which existed in Korea before either of the other two.  Themes  Kim Dong-ri has said that he wrote and adapted Eulhwa in order to ‚Äúfind a new human religion through the Shamanism buried in the weeds‚ÄùLee, Tae-dong. ‚ÄúEulhwa and the Nobel Prize in Literature, The Launch of a More Global Korean Literature.‚Äù In The Complete Works of Kim Dong-ri: Volume 2 ‚Äì Eulhwa, by Kim Dong-ri (Gaegangmunyae, 2013), 303.‚Äîa position that he expressed in the afterword to Eulhwa‚Äôs republishing. In particular, Kim Dong-ri thought that, in order to overcome the chaos and unease of the 20th century, we needed to create a new type of human and a god or gods with a different temperament from those that exist today. And it was through the image of a Shamanistic human that Kim Dong-ri pursued this ideal of a ‚Äúnew type of human.‚ÄùKim, Dong-ri. ‚ÄúAfterword to Eulhwa- Shamanism and My Literature: The Problem Humans Face at the Edge of the Cliff.‚Äù In The Complete Works of Kim Dong-ri: Volume 2 ‚Äì Eulhwa, by Kim Dong-ri (Gaegangmunyae, 2013), 252-255.

The district includes 58 houses built between 1916 and 1926, 55 of which are Chicago bungalows. As homeownership became more accessible in early twentieth century Chicago, the bungalow became popular as an affordable home design, and tens of thousands of the houses were built throughout Chicago. Like many of Chicago's bungalow- heavy neighborhoods, both the district and the Belmont Cragin neighborhood in general saw little residential development before the bungalow boom; however, the area was much more industrial than most similar neighborhoods. While several developers built bungalows in the district, the Stolzner Construction Company built over half of them, including every bungalow on the 4600 block. The company's architect, Joseph Klafter, differentiated the bungalows by changing details such as their color, entrance position, and dormer design.

Cayoosh Pass lies immediately northwest of the mountain, with Cayoosh Mountain on the opposite side of the pass. Its nearest higher peak is Joffre Peak, to the south, and Mount Rohr rises to the northeast. The mountain's name was submitted by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada to honor Chief Bill Pascall, an early leader of the Lillooet Band. The name was officially adopted on January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of Cayoosh Creek. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Chief Pascall is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.

Personal life  Wilson was born in 1944 in Comox, British Columbia. Wilson is the son of Puugladee (also known as Ethel or Effery), the eldest child of a hereditary chief and a hamatsa, a position of very high stature in Kwagiulth culture. Wilson‚Äôs father, Charlie Wilson, was the eldest of six and supported his siblings while growing up. Both of Wilson‚Äôs parents have passed away. His father died at age 62 from diabetes complications. Wilson is a descendant of the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk and Laich- kwil-tach peoples, which are part of the Kwakwaka ºwakw, also known as the Kwak‚Äôwala-speaking peoples. The Kwawkgewlth people are a warrior tribe. They traditionally live from northern Vancouver Island along the inside passage, the Broughton Archipelago and the mainland inlets, but are traditionally people of the sea. Wilson was married to Sandra Wilson, a teacher. They later divorced. They have two daughters, Jody Wilson-Raybould, former Member of Cabinet in the Justin Trudeau government, and Kory Wilson-Goertzen, a professor at Langara College Vancouver. Wilson is currently married to his second wife, Bev Sellars, a Chief of the Xat‚Äôsull (Soda Creek) First Nations. Wilson has six grand-daughters.  Education  Wilson studied at the University of Victoria where he was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1970. He then studied at the University of British Columbia (UBC) Faculty of Law where he received his law degree in 1973. In his year of admissions at UBC, he received the second highest Law School Admission Test score in British Columbia. He was the second Indigenous person to graduate from UBC‚Äôs law school. Wilson‚Äôs first cousin, Alfred Scow, was the first Indigenous person to graduate from UBC‚Äôs law school in 1961. Scow also went on to become the first Indigenous lawyer in British Columbia and the first Indigenous judge appointed to the BC Provincial Court where he presided from 1971 to 1992. Scow also won numerous awards, including the UBC Great Trekker Award, a UBC Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree, the Order of BC, and the Order of Canada.  Political career  Wilson served as director of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs from 1970 to 1973. In his third year of law school, Wilson was the director of Aboriginal title and land claims for the BC Association of Non-Status Indians. This organization was later renamed the United Native Nation where Wilson presided as founding president from 1976-1981. From 1982-83, Wilson was the vice-president of the Native Council of Canada, known now as the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, and was its spokesmen at the 1983 First Ministers Conference. In March of 1983, Wilson, and other Indigenous leaders, met with Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau to successfully negotiate and draft the first and only amendment to Canada‚Äôs new Constitution in 1982. This amendment is Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Section 35 enshrined Indigenous title to traditional lands and treaty rights and established equality of Indigenous women. During these negotiations, on Canadian national television, Wilson famously informed Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau that Wilson's two daughters hoped to become lawyers and then Prime Minister. In 1988, Wilson helped found the BC First Nations Congress, whose aim was to help coordinate land claims negotiations and settlements, and was elected its chairman. In 1990, the organization changed its name to the First Nations Summit and met with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to discuss land claims issues. In 1992, Wilson, Mulroney and BC Premier Mike Harcourt signed an agreement that created the BC Treaty Commission. Presently, Wilson is the coordinator of the Musgamagw Tribal Council of the Kwagiulth nation. He is a hamatsa, thus granted the name Hemas Kla-Lee-Lee-Kla, a recognition of his worthiness and his achievements that have led to his right to be a Hamatsa and a Chief of his tribe.

The ACCS is a confessionally collaborative project as individual editors have included scholars from Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and Protestantism as well as Jewish participation. Notable scholars who contributed to the series‚Äô publication include Andrew Louth, Peter W. Ochs, Benedicta Ward, Frances Young, Christopher A. Hall, Gerald L. Bray, and Manlio Simonetti. The ACCS was first conceived of in 1993 and inspired by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger. The Methodist scholar Thomas C. Oden, one of the leading paleo-orthodox theologians of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, serves as the overall ACCS series editor and the ACCS uses the ecumenically-minded Revised Standard Version of the Bible for its biblical translation. Format The ACCS covers both the Old Testament and the New Testament, including portions of the deuterocanonical writings which have varying degrees of acceptance among Christian traditions. Its format is such that some volumes contain only a portion of one biblical book (for instance, the ACCS commentary on Genesis is divided between Genesis 1-11 and Genesis 12-50) while other volumes of the ACCS contain multiple biblical books (for instance, Old Testament IV covers Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and 1-2 Samuel). The ACCS was modelled after the Talmud, with Oden explaining that ‚ÄúWe are trying to do for the Christian community what the Talmud was seeking to do for the Jewish liturgical memory.‚Äù The ACCS‚Äô editorial team employed the latest in digital technology, including Boolean searches, to track down Greek and Latin sources for texts, including many which had not yet been translated into English. The ACCS editors also made use of The Fathers of the Church (85 volumes) and the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (38 volumes), drawing from the church fathers‚Äô various writings, sermons, poetry, and letters. Oden explains that from the array of texts available, editors were ‚Äúencouraged‚Ä¶to select the best, wisest, and most representative reflections of the ancient Christian writers on any given biblical passage‚Äù in order to keep each volume concise. In this way, the ACCS attempts to provide consensual commentary rather than propagating one particular biblical interpretation. Mission and scope The ACCS's mission is to provide the accumulated wisdom of patristic exegesis on the biblical text by assembling and presenting the comments of both well-known church fathers such as Augustine, John Chrysostom, Jerome, and Gregory the Great as well as lesser-known figures including Pseudo-Macarius and Fulgentius of Ruspe and writings of the church fathers whose work does not yet appear in modern English. As one article explained, ‚ÄúDr. Oden and his colleagues have chosen a form of presentation with, as he puts it, ‚Äòvenerable antecedents‚Äô in Eastern Orthodoxy, medieval scholasticism, and the Reformation tradition of glossa ordinaria -- line-by-line commentaries on Bible texts.‚Äù The ACCS employs a presentation style with roots in the Christian tradition. Commentary was drawn from writings originally composed between the New Testament era to 750 AD. The ACCS also provides early non-European biblical interpretations as many of the early church fathers were based in the eastern Mediterranean world and in northern Africa. While the early Reformers were well-versed in patristics, many modern evangelicals are unfamiliar with the church fathers and the ACCS was designed as a means of ‚Äúressourcement,\\" particularly for evangelicals interested in patristic thought. The ACCS was largely funded through subscription, with approximately half of the original twenty-thousand subscribers committing through to the project‚Äôs completion. The first three volumes to be released covered the books of Matthew, Mark, and Romans. The ACCS has also been translated into other languages, including Chinese and Russian and is available in both print and electronic formats. The ACCS is consistently listed as a highly recommended commentary series by biblical scholars. Related projects The ACCS was released alongside The Church's Bible commentary series edited by Robert Louis Wilken and published by Eerdmans, a similar commentary series that featured longer extracts from the church fathers and which included writings that went up to 1000 AD. The ACCS helped to inspire the similar Reformation Commentary on Scripture, also published by Intervarsity Press and which is still currently ongoing and which collects portions of biblical interpretations from Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther, Martin Bucer, and John Calvin. Timothy George of Beeson Divinity School serves as its general editor. The ACCS also helped to inspire the five-volume Ancient Christian Doctrine series and the 15-volume Ancient Christian Texts series which provides readers with homilies and more extensive commentary from the church fathers.

Borrowing the title of Ren√© Magritte‚Äôs series of paintings, Empire of Light, Bichui jeguk is about a North Korean spy stationed in South Korea and the day he is summoned back to North Korea. The novel both overviews the societal changes that Korea went through from the 1980s to the 2000s and follows the fate of a man whose fate becomes wholly unknown to him. In 2016, Bichui jeguk was jointly adapted into a play by the National Theater of Korea and the Centre Dramatique National Orl√©ans and performed in both South Korea and France. Title The title Bichui jeguk (literally ‚ÄòEmpire of Light‚Äô) was borrowed from a series of paintings by Ren√© Magritte titled The Empire of Light. Unlike Magritte's other paintings, in which the absurdity of things lays in plain sight, one has to look closely at the paintings of The Empire of Light to notice that things are amiss. In particular, the paintings all depict a paradoxical scene of a nighttime street, lit by a street lamp, under a bright afternoon sky. Kim Young-ha has said that the world of Bichui jeguk is similar to Ren√©‚Äôs world of intermingling light and dark. And indeed, just as in The Empire of Light, the main character of Bichui jeguk is a man who is either alone in the dark or alone in the light and constantly switching back and forth in between.‚ÄúOn the Weak and Pitiful Fate of Blind Humans.‚Äù Dailian, August 29, 2006. http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/view/42585 Plot Summary In Bichui jeguk, one man must erase himself, the last twenty years of his life, and all traces that he ever existed, and he must do it all within a single day. Kim Gi-yeong‚Äîor rather Kim Seong-hun, as he was known in North Korea‚Äîspent four years training for his mission in South Korea while studying English at Pyeongyang University for Foreign Languages. In 1984, at the age of 21, Kim Gi-yeong is deployed to South Korea as a spy, and in 1986, following his orders from the party, Gi-yeong enrolls in a South Korean university and infiltrates the student-lead democracy movements. But ten years later when the agent in charge of Gi-yeong‚Äôs mission in the South falls from power, the orders being sent to him cease. Another ten years pass, and Gi-yeong is living a normal live as a 41-year-old South Korean citizen. But then one day, he receives an email; it‚Äôs a message from Pyeongyang, ordering him to erase all traces of his life in South Korea and return to North Korea in the next 24 hours. Having believed that all records of him in North Korea had been erased, Gi-yeong is dumbfounded. But for his survival, he must follow the orders.Kim, Young-ha. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù In Bichui jeguk, by Kim Young-ha. Munhakdongne, 2006. https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=2508549 From the moment Gi-yeong reads this email, the novel thrusts forward through the next 24 hours.Choi, Jae-bong. ‚ÄúWhere is a North Korean Spy to go in the Age of Post-Ideology?‚Äù Hankyoreh, August 10, 2006. http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/148251.html Themes Bichui jeguk retraces the trajectory of Korean society from the 1980s to the 2000s and the changes in the lives Koreans that came over that time span. From the aspect of political climate, national system, and the thought patterns of citizens, the South Korea of the 1980s that Kim Gi-yeong encounters is not much different from the North Korea of the 1980s.As one example of their similarity, you can take the passage in which Gi-yeong says that, among the subjects he had to be tested in to enter a South Korean university, it was ‚ÄúNational Ethics‚Äù that was the easiest. In other words, South Korea‚Äôs ‚ÄúNational Ethics,‚Äù which prioritized the nation and society, was similar to the North Korean system which prioritizes the party and its leader. In contrast to this, the consumer capitalist South Korea of the 2000s is a far cry from the 80s. And Gi-yeong‚Äîa former North Korean spy who infiltrated student movements but now leads a monotonous life as a fully assimilated citizen in a capitalist society‚Äîmakes this contrast even more palpable for the reader. And while Gi-yeong believes that he is in control of his own life, in reality he is inundated with daily life and desensitized to everything. And the way in which Gi-yeong‚Äôs life is completely turned upside down by a single email signifies just how blind humans are to a wholly unpredictable future.‚ÄúOn the Weak and Pitiful Fate of Blind Humans.‚Äù Dailian, August 29, 2006. http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/view/42585 Indeed, the harder Gi-yeong tries to understand the ordeal he finds himself in, the only thing that he learns is that he knows nothing, showing that humans are always at the whim of destiny, not matter how hard they struggle against it.Lee, Go-un. ‚ÄúDepictions of Our Life Swept up in Fate.‚Äù Herald Corporation, August 11, 2006. https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD‚à£=sec&sid1;=103&oid;=016&aid;=0000217422 Style Kim Young-ha has stated that ‚ÄúStrictly speaking, Bichui jeguk isn‚Äôt trying to say anything,‚Äù and that, ‚ÄúAt the deepest level, Bichui jeguk is actually trying to challenge the concept of ‚Äòtrying to say something.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄúOn the Weak and Pitiful Fate of Blind Humans.‚Äù Dailian, August 29, 2006. http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/view/42585 Indeed, this process of destroying the belief that we can control our lives is conveyed not just through the novel‚Äôs content, but through its form, as well.Lee, Go-un. ‚ÄúDepictions of Our Life Swept up in Fate.‚Äù Herald Corporation, August 11, 2006. https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD‚à£=sec&sid1;=103&oid;=016&aid;=0000217422 In the never-ending flow of various episodes, it is hard to find causes or logical necessities.

Munhwayesul, 2006. http://www.arko.or.kr/zine/artspaper2006_12/pdf/192.pdf Bichui jeguk also reminds one of a Greek tragedy in the way its main character struggles to understand all of reality and become the master of their fate, despite the fact they cannot understand the full nature of the circumstances they find themselves in. At the same time, employing elements such as black humor, cynicism, and a self-aware parody of a movie chase scene, Kim Young-ha retains his unique style in this work. In this sense, Bichui jeguk can be called a modern adaption of Greek tragedy.Shin, Su-jeong. ‚ÄúIsolation for a Day ‚Äì Greek Tragedy and Bichui jeguk.‚Äù Munhakdongne, 2006. Kim Young-ha has stated that the two works that affected his life the most are the Greek tragedies King Oedipus and The Odyssey, saying that stories about self-confident characters being ruined overnight have always interested him. Reception Because of the way it reflects on Korean society through a character who has experienced both the South Korean and North Korean systems, Bichui jeguk has been compared to Choi In-hun‚ÄôsChoi In-hun (1936-2018) was a Korean novelist, poet, literary critic, and playwright. https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%B5%9C%EC%9D%B8%ED%9B%88 1960 novel, Gwangjang (Í¥ëÏû• The Square)Gwangjang (196) is one of Choi In-hun‚Äôs most famous works. Through the juxtaposition of a plaza and a closet, Gwangjang depicts the contrasting lives of a character who exists between North Korean and South Korean society, between the collective and the person, the societal and the existential. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=3572030&cid;=58822&categoryId;=58822. Whereas Gwangjang deals with the early stages of the division of the Korean peninsula from the 50s to the 60s, Bichui jeguk deals with the neo- liberalization of South Korean society from the 1980s to the 2000s.‚ÄúGwangjang and Bichui jeguk, An Account of Korean Society, Yonhap News, November 4, 2010. Unlike Gwangjang, in which the main character contemplates which ideology to which to subscribe, the protagonist of Bichui jeguk is not concerned by ideology because ideology has already completely lost to everyday desires. In this way, Bichui jeguk has been lauded as a piece that signals a ‚Äúpost- ideological era.‚ÄùChoi, Jae-bong. ‚ÄúWhere is a North Korean Spy to go in the Age of Post-Ideology?‚Äù Hankyoreh, August 10, 2006. http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/148251.html Despite these accolades, some have criticized that Kim Young-ha‚Äôs deterministic worldview led to overly cynical and negative depictions of South Korea‚Äôs activist groups and their decline.Woo, Chan-je. ‚ÄúThe Net of the Connection Era and the Ontology of Ghosts ‚Äì Kim Young-ha‚Äôs Bichui Jeguk‚Äù.

In particular, Arthur Nauzyceil was in charge of directing and Valerie Mrejen handled the adaption. In addition to this, Pierre-Alain Giraud from the creative team brought to life on stage the both familiar and unfamiliar daily life of Seoul that was depicted in the novel.

Plot Vorvong and Sorvong Tale illustration. Khmer 19th century drawing. Two princes, Vorvong and Sorvong, brothers, are mistakenly expelled from the royal court by their father the king. Separated from each other, they wander for a decade while facing incredible hardships and vicissitudes including defeating a giant in a cave, suffering the betrayal of the hermit Vorvongby, using magic rings and crystal balls, and repeated interventions by the gods. Finally, they are rejoined to do battle against their wicked stepbrother in a dramatic attempt to enlighten the king to the injustice they suffered, restore their titles, and bring peace and harmony to the kingdom.  Origin  = An oral tradition of Khmer folklore = Khmer folklore has a rich and varied oral tradition. There are many popular legends, tales and songs of ancient origin about mythical heroes, heroines and ghosts. These were not put into writing until the 19th and 20th centuries. Before then they had been memorized and told for generations. The oral-tradition legends were often extremely long stories in rhyming verses. The heroes were mostly princes and supernatural beings and the scenarios were often connected to the palaces and the monasteries. One important purpose of these legends and stories handed down for centuries was to transmit norms and values. Most stories emphasize the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Vorvong and Sorvong is one of the oral traditions of the Khmer folklore of unknown origin, apart from its geographical origin in Phnom Sruoch District, Kampong Speu Province, where two mountains bare their names. As is often the case in Khmer buddhism, the two heroes are considered boddhisatvas, earlier incarnations of the buddha, and as such they find themselves represented in various monasteries. = The hills of Kirirom National Park = There are two hills in Kirirom National Park ‚Äî Phnom Sruoch District and Kampong Speu Province ‚Äîwhich were named in honor of the two heroic princely brothers, Vorvong and Sorvong. The name \\"Kirirom\\" which means \\"Happy Mountain\\" name was given to the area by King Monivong in the 1930s to the mountain which were named Vorvong and Sorvong before then.  Translations  = First translation in Thai by future King Ang Duong around 1860 = During his residence in Thailand, Ang Duong composed poetry, authored and published classical Cambodian literature and historical works and later promoted the enactment of a comprehensive reformed legal codex and participated in the artistic development of Khmer classical dance. He translated the Cambodian folktale Vorvong and Sorvong into the Thai language as a birthday present for Thai Crown prince Mongkut. = Translation in French by Auguste Pavie in 1903 = Auguste Pavie, a French civil servant, obtained the folk legend version he wrote down from an \\"Old Uncle Nip\\" in Samraongtong District. The story was put into writing in Battambang.Pavie, Auguste, Contes populaires du Cambodge, du Laos et du Siam. Paris: Leroux, 1903. = First English translation in 2019 = This first English translation was published in a full color edition featuring 51 illustrations in 2019. It was translated from the French by Marie-Helene Arnauld, with Jim Mizerski and Joel Montague providing the introduction and commentary.  Adaptation for theatre  In November 2006 the Legend of Vorvong and Sorvong was enacted in dance form by the Royal Ballet of Cambodia to celebrate the French-Cambodian relations on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the visit in France of King Sisowath, the 40th anniversary of the visit of the General de Gaulle in Phnom Penh but also the visit of State of King Norodom Sihamoni in november 2006 in Paris.

Lovable losers are often defined by ambitions exceeding their capabilities, and by their over-zealous, and sometimes self-defeating, efforts to obtain their desires. They are prone to fall for get-rich-quick schemes, and advertised shortcuts to finding wealth, success, or love, and to act impulsively in the pursuit of these things, but at the same time may be prone to act ethically and selflessly, resisting efforts to lure them into behavior that would actually harm others. They are often depicted as falling into a dynamic where their friends are disdainful of their efforts, or offer bad advice or other counterproductive help. Examples of lovable losers in media include Charlie Brown, the main character of the Peanuts comic strip by Charles Schulz, whose exploits in futility include an inability to fly a kite without getting it stuck in a tree, never receiving valentines from anyone in his school class, being the pitcher on a winless baseball team, and repeatedly being convinced by Lucy to try and kick a football, only for her to yank it away at the last second; Chandler Bing on Friends, who for most of the show's run was unable to find romance (in contrast with his roommate, Joey Tribbiani, who easily fell into meaningless relationships); and Andy, the main character in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, who must deal with overly forward efforts by his friends and coworkers who want to help him lose his virginity. At one time it was noted that \\"[a]lmost every top-rated series has a regular, dependable loser; a patsy who always gets the short end of the stick, a fall guy who is left with egg on his face\\".Vernon Scott, \\"Many Actors Make Fame By Being Lovable Losers\\", Lubbock Avalanche-Journal (January 18, 1965), p.

He assisted British citizens and others during World War II, when Hong Kong, then a British territory, was invaded by Japan. At the time Macau was controlled by Portugal, which had not chosen a side in the war; Macau was not invaded by any party. Colin Day and Richard Garrett edited the published work, and the volume also includes an essay written by David Calthorpe about Reeves. It is a part of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Studies Series. Background Reeves wrote his memoirs in 1946, starting his efforts while engaging in his \\"home leave\\", and continuing whilst serving for the Foreign Office in Rome, Italy.Day, page ix (PDF p. 6/67) The writing ended in 1949. \\\\- Reprinted in the Portuguese American Journal Editor Day wrote that \\"It is quite apparent that he hoped for publication\\" and therefore Reeves wrote deliberately in a manner of \\"occasional vagueness\\".Day, page x (PDF p. 7/67) However the Foreign Office asked him not to publish the book to avoid complicating relations between the United Kingdom and Portugal, the Republic of China, and the United States in addition to standard Foreign Office rules against such matters. Day wrote that \\"It is believed that the main body of the memoir was hand-written and then typed by a secretary, probably in Rome.\\"Day, page xvii (PDF p. 14/67) Calthorpe's partner created a Microsoft Word file using the text of the typed document. Wilhelm Snyman gave copies of the Word file to the editors of the published volume and also introduced the file to Macau itself.

On June 11, 2020, the statue was removed for an undisclosed period after its head was decapitated by protestors on the evening of June 9, 2020. Background The Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization dominated by Italian Americans, opened Waterfront Park in 1976. In 1979, pro-Vietnam War activist and building contractor Arthur Stivaletta commissioned the statue. The Knights accordingly changed the name of the park to Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park. The North End was a traditionally Italian neighborhood, and Columbus was a symbolic figure for Italian Americans in Boston as well as throughout the country. As early as 1900, George A. Scigliano had pushed to designate Columbus Day a holiday in Massachusetts. Conversely, other Catholics in Boston apparently did not appreciate the use of Columbus; in 1922, the Irish-American cardinal William Henry O'Connell removed a statue of Columbus from the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Description The statue is made of marble imported from Carrara, an ancient quarry in Tuscany. The pedestal beneath it displays Stivaletta's name and the names of other prominent Italian Americans from the North End. It also names the Knights of Columbus and Order Sons of Italy in America. History The statue was installed in Boston's Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park The statue was dedicated on Columbus Day 1979, at a ceremony attended by Stivaletta, the Italian American community of Boston, Mayor Kevin White and former governor John Volpe. Shortly afterwards, on November 18, 1979, Stivaletta burned the flag of Iran in front of the statue. He presented to the audience of 200 spectators a man wearing a rubber devil mask, explaining that he was a caricature of the Ayatollah Khomeini. In December 1981, Stivaletta's organization Wake Up America burned the flag of the Soviet Union in front of the statue. Stivaletta remarked, ‚ÄúWe stand here before Christopher Columbus, in a country founded by people looking for political and religious freedom ‚Ä¶ to show support for nations searching for freedom.‚Äù On Columbus Day 1982, the Friends of Christopher Columbus Park held a Catholic mass in front of the statue and laid a wreath on its pedestal. In 1999, the director of the Massachusetts Historical Society published an op-ed in the Boston Globe calling for the statue to be removed, noting that Boston has no historical connection to Christopher Columbus. He suggested restoring the park to commemorate its historical use as a fishing wharf. =Vandalism and removal= In the 2000s, the statue suffered vandalism such as being spray painted with the word \\"murderer.\\" In June 2006, the statue was decapitated in an apparent prank; the head was later located elsewhere in the North End. In 2004 and 2006, the statue was covered in red paint. After the latter incident an anti-colonialist manifesto was posted to the Independent Media Center website, taking responsibility for the act.

When the paper changed its name to Indian Country Today, Little Eagle was the one who suggested the new name. In 2002, Little Eagle founded the Teton Times in McLaughlin, South Dakota. The newspaper only exists in print, without a website. The paper serves the Standing Rock Reservation, where Little Eagle says many of her customers don't have internet access, so that, she says, \\"her printed paper is the only way they know what's going on with local government or whose kids made the honor roll.\\" Unlike many Native newspapers, the Teton Times is independent, rather than being owned by the tribal government of the area it serves. Tim Giago identifies the Teton Times as one of the \\"most read, most influential of these independent newspapers.\\" In the report American Indian Media Today, Jodi Rave emphasizes the importance of independent ownership: \\"Press freedom for tribe-owned media is a key challenge faced by Native American media. Tribal governments remain the largest media owners and control an estimated 72 percent of newspapers and radio stations.\\" In 2005, Little Eagle ran for office within the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and became the first woman elected to be vice president.

He is active in both Japan and the United States. He is gay and an advocate for LGBTQ people.  Early life and education  Nishimura was born in 1989 and grew up in Tokyo. His father was a Jodo shu Buddhist priest, and Nishimura was raised in his temple. He studied ikebana for eight years. After watching The Princess Diaries in junior high school, Nishimura became interested in visiting the United States. Nishimura briefly struggled with his perception of his own beauty as an Asian man before discovering makeup, which he did not use in Japan because of social stigmas. After graduating from high school, Nishimura moved to the United States and studied at Dean College, where he asked drag queens working at makeup stores questions about what to buy. He then purchased makeup and learned how to use it. He graduated from the Parsons School of Design.  Career  Nishimura began working as a makeup artist when he was 22. He got an internship with a makeup artist that later led to a job. His work was featured in Nylon and Life & Style. He also does makeup for beauty queens in Miss Universe contests. In addition, Nishimura spends time teaching transgender women how to apply makeup. Nishimura came out as gay when he participated in a photo shoot for Out in Japan. When he returned to Japan, Nishimura began to train as a priest. At first, he was hesitant to do so because of his career as a makeup artist. He thought that being a makeup artist might not conform with Buddhist beliefs. After consulting with a mentor, he realized that he could be both a Buddhist priest and a makeup artist as long as his goal was to spread Buddhist beliefs about living in happiness and harmony with others. He was fully ordained in 2015 and serves in his father's temple. Nishimura splits his time equally between his work as a makeup artist and his work as a priest.

Along the daughters of Russian officials, in the same year, two Kazakh girls-Zeyneb Abdurakhmanova and Gulsum Asfendiyarova were able to receive a scholarship. After graduating from the Institute in 1908 and returning to work at home, they became the first female doctors among the indigenous inhabitants of the newly created province.‚Üë –ü–µ—Ä–µ–π—Ç–∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω–æ:1 2 3 4 5 6 –ú–∞–¥–∏—Ä–∏–º –ú–∞—Ö–º—É–¥–æ–≤. –ì—É–ª—å—Å—É–º –ê—Å—Ñ–µ–Ω–¥–∏–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞ ‚Äî –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –≤—Ä–∞—á-–∫–∞–∑–∞—à–∫–∞. –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ –•—É—Ä—à–∏–¥–∞ –î–∞–≤—Ä–æ–Ω–∞ (18.09.2015). –î–∞—Ç–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏—è 28 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2017.

Asfendiyarova are closely connected with Turkestan ‚Äî and the title of \\"first\\" has traditionally been assigned to her. After graduating from the Institute, Asfendiyarova filed a petition addressed to Emperor Nikolay II: Having the desire to enter the service of Your Majesty as a doctor in the Turkestan military district, in the village Temirlanovka, Shymkent district of Syr-Darya region, I ask you to accept my petition to identify my service in the Turkestan military district. \\\\- May 16, 1908 –ñ“Ø–Ω—ñ—Å–±–∞–µ–≤ –ê. ¬´–°–∞–Ω–∂–∞—Ä –ê—Å—Ñ–µ–Ω–¥–∏–∞—Ä–æ–≤: ”©–º—ñ—Ä—ñ –º–µ–Ω “õ—ã–∑–º–µ—Ç—ñ¬ª (1889‚Äî1938 –∂–∂.). –¢. –Ü (1889‚Äî1918 –∂–∂.). ‚Äî –ê–ª–º–∞—Ç—ã: ¬´–ï–ª—Ç–∞–Ω—ã–º –±–∞—Å–ø–∞—Å—ã¬ª, 2014. ‚Äî –ë. 45.

In 1910, Asfendiyarova transferred to work in the Papal rural medical district of Namangan County, where working conditions were slightly easier. On the eve 1912 year father conveyed Gulsum proposal Khiva vizier begin to work in under construction Khiva urban hospital. Gulsum agreed on the condition that her salary and pension guarantees due would not be less than the current ones for the Russian medical service. In 1913, she began her duties as an obstetrician-assistant to the chief physician in Khiva. Here, for the first time in the history of this Asian region, she performed a Caesarean section. In a month the small Khiva city hospital accepted 3-4 thousand people. In 1914, with the beginning of turbulent times, G. Asfendiyarova returned to Tashkent. Here, with the help of her father, she opened a private hospital with 30 beds. Gradually, her socially active father-most likely a supporter of Patriotic and social \\"movements\\" in Turkestan-introduced her to his activities. In the era of the February and October revolutions, the position of the head of one of the city maternity hospitals, as, undoubtedly, the personal position and reputation of G. D. Asfendiyarova, served as the basis for her nomination in 1918 as a delegate to the all-Russian Congress of Muslim women in Kazan at which she was elected a member of the Organizing Bureau.‚Ä¢ –õ–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ –£–º–º–∏-–ì—É–ª—å—Å—É–º –ê—Å—Ñ–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π (–Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –≤ –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–µ –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥–∞).

In 1920, on behalf and with the support of the Muslim Bureau, headed by the people's Commissar of health of the TASSR T. Ryskulov, G. Asfandiarova organizes \\"women's obstetric courses\\", where she personally conducts the discipline \\"Physiology of pregnant women\\". Later, the courses were reassigned to Tashkent medical College named after Yu Ahunbababeva, but she continued to teach here until her death. Since 1922, Asfendiyarova combines teaching with work in the Children's city hospital, where her assistant was A. Doszhanova - the first graduate of the East Asian University which opened in Tashkent, majoring in doctor (autumn 1922). Asfendiyarova had known Dosjanova in the Organizational Bureau of the Muslim women of Russia in Kazan. ‚Äî So, in that way the race of women of the East for equal rights in the sphere of professions continued. In the 1920s, G. D.

The official pilot was released on YouTube on October 28, 2019. On November 6, 2019, Medrano stated on Patreon that there was no stated release date for a second episode yet. By August 2020, the show had developed a dedicated fanbase, with the thirty-minute pilot receiving over 40 million views as of that same date. On August 7 of 2020, it was announced that A24 had picked up Hazbin Hotel as a full television series, but any information related to its production or release date remains unknown. The series' protagonist, a charismatic demon named Charlie, is the princess of Hell, and has the mission to do the impossible: rehabilitate sinners in the titular \\"Hazbin Hotel\\" as a peaceful solution to the current overpopulation crisis. Charlie invites sinister sinners of all descriptions to check in to the Hazbin Hotel and, hopefully, \\"check out\\" en route to Heaven. Premise The series follows the misadventures of Charlie (Jill Harris), the princess of Hell and heir to the throne as she sets about fulfilling her dream of opening up a hotel called the \\"Happy Hotel\\" which aims to rehabilitate sinners. Due to overpopulation, the citizens go through an annual \\"cleanse\\", arranged by angels. Her main goal is hoping that her clients will be \\"checking out\\" peacefully into Heaven. With the help of her devoted manager and girlfriend Vaggie (Monica Franco) and their first patron, pornographic film actor Angel Dust (Michael Kovach), she's determined to make her dream become a reality. But when her proposal on live television goes sour, her plan attracts the attention of the powerful \\"radio demon\\" Alastor (Edward Bosco) who, despite finding her belief in redemption laughable, wants to help Charlie run the hotel for his own amusement. Characters =Main characters= *' (voiced by Jill Harris; singing voice by Elsie Lovelock) is the main protagonist and founder of the titular Hazbin Hotel (originally named the Happy Hotel as seen in the pilot). She is the daughter of Lucifer and Lilith, and is one of the few demons born in Hell. Upset by the yearly cleanse in which a number of demons are destroyed by the Exterminators, she and her girlfriend, Vaggie, seek to open a hotel that allows for the rehabilitation of sinners with the hope that they can receive forgiveness and enter heaven. Her bold plans are often laughed at by most of the demons in hell. She is shown to be very naive and hopelessly optimistic but cares deeply for her people. She has a love for musical theatre, preferring to express herself in song and dance. *' (voiced by Monica Franco) is the Manager of the Hazbin Hotel and Charlie's girlfriend. She is highly supportive of Charlie and has a quick temper. Often acting as the more level- headed and rational one, she struggles to keep the hotel's image up. She is quite annoyed by Angel Dust's trouble-making and doesn't trust Alastor at all due to his notorious reputation. She can also summon various knives, spears and daggers at will. There is little information about her past life, but it is known that she entered Hell in 2014. *\\"Angel Dust\\" Anthony (voiced by Michael Kovach) is a gay spider demon adult entertainer, and the first volunteer for Charlie's rehabilitation program. He does not appear to take Charlie's cause seriously, stating to only be interested in the rent-free accommodation, much to Vaggie's anger, and tends to get into mischief behind their backs and is very selfish and insolent. In his mortal life, Angel was born into a crime family, most of which reside in Hell with him. Angel struggled with drug addiction which ultimately led to his death in 1947. His stage name is based on the street name for the drug phencyclidine, which he still regularly uses in Hell. *' the \\"'Radio Demon\\" (voiced by Edward Bosco; singing voice by Gabriel C. Brown), is an eccentric Overlord of Hell. He is known to be extremely powerful, and is capable of rivaling some of Hell's most ancient demons, despite having been a mortal human in life. Upon his arrival in hell he built up a terrifying reputation seemingly overnight. Often keeping to a calm and gentlemanly demeanor, he prefers to always keep a smile on his face and shares Charlie's love of music and dance. His voice sounds like a vintage 1920s radio complete with static, sound effects including a laugh track, and theme music. He offers his services to Charlie in order to help her maintain her goal of running the hotel, but only for the amusement of watching other demons fail in the process. Charlie reluctantly allows him to help for as long as he chooses, as long as he doesn't do anything to jeopardize the hotel, to avoid making one of his infamous pacts. He provides two staff members and protects Charlie's business from outside threats. It's stated that in his past life, Alastor was an asexual radio announcer who lived a double life as a serial killer in New Orleans, Louisiana. Having lived to see the stock market crash, he died in 1933. * Niffty (voiced by Michelle Marie) is a small, hyperactive cyclops demon from the 1950s who's obsessed with cleanliness. She died at age 22. She is summoned by Alastor to serve as the hotel housekeeper. * Husk \\"Husker\\" (voiced by Mick Lauer), an ill-tempered cat demon. He is summoned by Alastor to serve as the receptionist and bartender at the hotel. He died in the 1970s of alcohol poisoning. =Recurring characters= ;Overlords of Hell * Lucifer and Lilith Magne: In the pilot, Charlie's parents are only shown in shadow and in a portrait.

Additionally, the song reached number 14 on the US Dance/Electronic Songs chart and number four on the Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart. Reception The series' pilot episode has been generally well-received by critics for its animation quality, music and characters. Stephen Novak from The Oswegonian student newspaper praised the animation, writing, and characters in Hazbin Hotel. However, he criticized the songs, saying \\"while Hazbin Hotel will certainly not appeal to everyone, those who can appreciate good animation and fun characters will certainly find themselves tortured by what is likely to be a long wait until the next episode.\\" Matt Smith of another student newspaper, The Harbinger, had similar thoughts. Smith praised the show as a \\"hilariously dark look\\" into life in Hell while lauding the voice acting, singing, and animation. At the same time, he pointed out the show is clearly \\"not for kids\\", noting the drug and sexual references as well as strong language. Smith notes that the animation is crisp and lively, but not perfect. He states that the show has great pacing, and worries that there is \\"no timeline\\" on when the rest of the season can be expected. However, others have taken offense from the show, due to the fact that there are many problematic characters, who say and do some questionable things. On August 7, 2020, Matt Braly, the creator of Amphibia, offered his support for the show, calling the action by A24 in picking up the show for a full television series a \\"fantastic fucking step forward\\" and \\"great.\\" References External links * * Category:American adult animated web series Category:2010s black comedy television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related comedy television series Category:2010s American musical comedy television series Category:2019 web series debuts Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:American adult animated musical television series Category:American adult animated dark comedy web series Category:American adult animated musical web series Category:American television pilots Category:Adult comedy web series Category:Fiction about the afterlife Category:Hell in popular culture Category:Demons in television Category:Independent animation Category:American comedy webcomics Category:LGBT-related animated web series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series set in hotels Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Television shows adapted into comics Category:Television series about demons Category:Genocide in fiction Category:2010s YouTube series Category:2020s YouTube series Category:Overpopulation fiction Category:Upcoming animated television series ","title":"Hazbin Hotel"},{"id":"62350552","text":"Storvik may refer to: People *Kaia Storvik (born 1976), Norwegian journalist, former newspaper editor and politician *Kenneth Storvik (born 1972), Norwegian football midfielder *Kjell Storvik (born 1930), Norwegian economist and former Governor of the Central Bank of Norway Places *Storvik, Sweden, a locality ","title":"Storvik"},{"id":"62350570","text":"Backun Musical Services Ltd. (BMS) is a Canadian manufacturer of clarinets in B and A and accessories, based in Burnaby, British Columbia.  History  In 2000 clarinettist and entrepreneur, Morrie Backun opened a small repair shop for woodwind instruments with two employees. After having been commissioned by J. Wesley (Wes) Foster, Principal Clarinet of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra to overhaul one of his clarinets, Backun was unable to complete the project, as the original barrel of the instrument was missing. After consulting with Foster, Backun set out to make a barrel from cocobolo wood (Dalbergia retusa), which became the first Backun Barrel. After a short period of making only barrels, Backun then set out to design a clarinet bell in 2001 and mouthpieces in 2004.Paul Globus, Industry Profiles Interview with Morie Backun, Clarinet, Jun2004, Vol. 31 Issue 3, p34 Gaining international renown for clarinet barrels, bells and mouthpieces, in addition to designing and modifying clarinets by other makers, Backun was approached by Conn-Selmer, which had 2004 acquired the clarinet maker Leblanc, to redesign and develop their line of clarinets.Backun to Head LeblancClarinet R&D;, Music Trades, May2006, Vol. 154 Issue 4, p146 His first complete clarinet in B, which was distributed by Leblanc and Conn-Selmer under the label \\"Leblanc by Backun\\".Paul Globus, A Marriage Made in Clarinet Heaven.

The two models differ in appearance, as well as bore and tonehole design, given that Backun designed the Lumiere to meet the needs of players looking for more vibrant and sweeter tone than the MoBa, which is considered to be dark and powerful. Both the Lumi√®re and MoBa models in Cocobolo are offered at a considerable extra cost as Super Series sets, in such a way that the clarinets are made entirely from the same single five foot piece of wood, and therefore has the same grain structure throughout from the B down through the A. 6\\\\. Custom model CG Carbon Clarinet in B and A with 18 keys, 6 rings and Eb-lever (CG are the initials of the italian clarinettist Corrado Giuffredi). These patent-pending clarinets, developed by BMS and available only from BMS, have a carbon-coated body (upper and lower joint) over either a Grenadilla or Cocobolo wood core. The hard- pressed with the wood core coating to prevent cracks and increase the life, but also leads to a different sound. The surface is black-mottled; barrel and bell are made of grenadilla or cocobolo for tonal reasons. To emphasize is the thoughtful and characteristic design of the instruments, including the student models, and the items, such as barrels and bells. Due to the uniformity of their design, Backun clarinets are instantly recognizable despite a certain amount of detail. The company sells its instruments not only itself, but also through a worldwide dealer network. The current prices for the mentioned models are shown on the website. The prices at the dealers are consistently cheaper.

It also functions under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) which is chaired by Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security. As of November 2019, the NCSS is headed by Mr Benedict Chia (Director of Strategic Issues), Ms Pamela Lee (Director of Policy and Planning), Ms Janath Nisah (Assistant Executive) and Mr Ho Hiang Kwee (Lead Technologist). It is headquartered at 55 Newton Road Revenue House, #11-01 Singapore 307987. There are 2 main departments: Policy and Planning and Strategic Issues. There are 5 other sub-departments, namely Mitigation and Resilience Policy and Planning, International Policy, Economic Research, Technology Innovation and Deployment, and Policy Innovation and Futures. The agency has 4 main responsibilities. Firstly, it helps reduce carbon emissions throughout all sectors. Secondly, it assists the nation in adapting to the short-term and long-term effects of climate change. Thirdly, it seeks to tap on green growth opportunities brought about by climate change. Lastly, it promotes climate consciousness and climate action among the general public.  History  The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) was set up on 1 July 2010 under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Mr Tan Yong Soon, who has since retired from the Singapore Civil Service in October 2012, was appointed as the agency's first Permanent Secretary. The agency was initially located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was brought under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and then headed by a Permanent Secretary in order to \\"reflect the important scope of policy matters to be coordinated\\". The strengthening of the agency came after Singapore submitted its emissions reduction targets under the Copenhagen Accord, evidence that the nation was dedicated to delivering on its commitments, both international and domestic.  Programmes  = Public Consultations = To date, the National Climate Change Secretariat has held 3 Public Consultation exercises with the aim of gathering public feedback and suggestions on Singapore's domestic climate change-related policies. Methods to obtain feedback and perspectives include focus group discussions, online consultations, and closed-door stakeholder dialogues. * Public Consultation on Climate Change and Singapore (2015) **Suggestions and feedback were gathered from stakeholders across the private and people sectors to support efforts to develop Singapore's plan to reduce carbon emissions and promote green growth beyond 2020. This was in line with Singapore's participation in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which led to the signing of the Paris Agreement. * Public Consultation on Singapore's Climate Change Strategy and Carbon Tax (2017) **Feedback was gathered with regard to the proposed carbon tax as well as Singapore's strategy in harnessing green growth opportunities and improving carbon efficiency in all sectors. * Public Consultation on Developing Singapore's Long-Term Low Emissions Strategy (2019) **The consultation targeted the republic's low carbon strategy after 2030 and it came in a year where student-led climate strikes took place around the world, including a climate rally staged in Hong Lim Park, Singapore. = School Outreach = The agency produces educational materials, such as posters, infographics, and drama programmes, aimed at raising awareness of climate change among youths in Singapore. = Plans and Reports = Based on its own research, and data collected from other agencies, the NCCS publishes plans and reports which chart Singapore's response to climate change.  Related Legislation  = Carbon Tax = It was announced at Budget 2017 by the Minister of Finance that a carbon tax would be implemented from 2019 onwards, starting from $5 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. The tax applies to all facilities that emit more than 25,000 or more tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and is expected to increase to between $10 and $15 per carbon dioxide equivalent by 2023. = Coastal Protection = During the 2019 National Day Rally Speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong predicted that it may cost Singapore at least $100 billion to protect the island from rising sea levels. Possible options for the island-nation include building polders and dykes along the eastern coastline to protect low-lying areas, and reclaiming a series of islands form Marina East to Changi, connecting them with barrages and creating a reservoir. It was also announced that a small polder was being built at Pulau Tekong to protect existing low-lying areas, and to allow the republic to gain some experience operating one.

It specializes in Jiro-style ramen. The restaurant is known for its service concept: diners are encouraged to share their dreams and aspirations to their fellow diners after finishing their meal. History Yume Wo Katare was opened by Tsuyoshi Nishioka in November 2012. He had previously worked in ramen restaurants in Kyoto to support his career as a comedian, and later owned and run five Ramen Jiro branches in Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe which he later sold to their managers before relocating to the United States in 2011. Nishioka initially considered setting up shop in Hawaii and New York City, but was disappointed by the disproportionately large number of Japanese Americans in both locations. He wanted to set up a restaurant in a location with a large student population. He flew into Boston the day after another guest at his New York hotel suggested he open his restaurant there, and decided to set up shop in Porter Square. The restaurant closed over the summer of 2013, during which it was redecorated. For three non-consecutive days in 2014, Jorgen \\"Walker\\" Peterson, a former chemist who worked as the restaurant's manager, launched a vegan version of the ramen recipe as a pop-up restaurant which operated in the Yume Wo Katare space during lunch hours, at a time when the restaurant is closed. Three years later, Nishioka opened Yume Ga Arukara (), a sister restaurant in a nearby part of Cambridge which serves udon, and was later named by Bon App√©tit as one of the top ten new restaurants in the United States for 2018. Nishioka returned to Japan in 2018, where he has since opened up outposts of Yume Wo Katare in Beppu, where he currently lives, as well as in Okinawa, training around 50 apprentices how to create Jiro-style ramen with the goal of opening dream-centric ramen shops in all 47 Japanese prefectures. Concept A bowl of Yume Wo Katare ramen. Yume Wo Katare has been described as not just being a restaurant, but a \\"dream factory\\" and a food-centered aspirational community. Nishioka was deeply affected by the suicide of a partner in the comedy troupe he once performed with in Japan, and he has since made it his life's mission to help people achieve their dreams. To that end, the restaurant offers regular \\"dream workshops\\" in addition to its culinary offerings, particularly targeting Japanese students in Cambridge to help them figure out their own life dreams and goals. The restaurant only offers one dish: a bowl of ramen either in regular or large (buta) sizes which vary based on the amount of chƒÅsh≈´, served alongside cabbage and bean sprouts, as well as options for extra fat and garlic. The ramen base is made from a tonkotsu broth that cooks for 14 hours, giving it a rich flavor, combined with a sh≈çyu broth and hand-cut noodles. The dish itself has been described by The Boston Globe as being \\"porky, garlicky, hefty, [and] intense\\", with prospective diners waiting in line for it every day, sometimes for over an hour. Although Yume Wo Katare is arranged like a classroom, with space for 18 diners at one time, it is known for its interactive and novel yet highly regimented dining experience. When diners are finished, they are encouraged to share their dreams with all other diners in the room, with everyone cheering and showing support. Afterward, they are graded by restaurant staff either with a \\"perfect\\", \\"good job\\", \\"almost\\" or \\"next time\\" grade based on how much of the dish is left in their bowl, with the goal of pushing people beyond what they may think they're capable of, as well as discouraging wasteful consumption.
