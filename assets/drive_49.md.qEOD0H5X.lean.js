It was developed in the 1950s, based loosely on the second prototype Br√©guet Vultur attack aircraft which had been modified into the Br√©guet Br.965 √âpaulard anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Design The Aliz√© was a low-wing monoplane of conventional configuration powered by a single Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine. It had a CSF radar system with a retractable antenna dome in its belly. The cockpit accommodated a crew of three, including pilot, radar operator, and sensor operator. The pilot was seated in front on the left, the navigator in front on the right, and the sensor operator sat sideways behind them. The landing gear was of tricycle configuration, with the main gear retracting backwards into nacelles in the wings. The main gear had dual wheels, and the front part of the nacelles accommodated sonobuoys. The Aliz√© had a yoke-style arresting hook. The internal weapons bay could accommodate a homing torpedo or depth charges, and underwing stores pylons could carry bombs, depth charges, rockets, or missiles. Typical underwing stores included 68 mm (2.68 in) rocket pods or AS.12 wire-guided antiship missiles.

It was exhibited at the Paris Air Show at Paris Le Bourget Airport in May 1957. A total of 89 examples of the Aliz√© were built between 1957 and 1962, including two preproduction prototypes. 75 production aircraft were acquired by the A√©ronavale, with initial service delivery in March 1959. The Aliz√© went into operation on the carriers Arromanches, Cl√©menceau and Foch, and were also used in shore-based training. 12 were acquired by the Indian Navy. Some sources say that there were five preproduction prototypes, which may mean some of the prototypes were brought up to production standard and passed on to the A√©ronavale; and that India acquired 17 examples, which hints that they bought five used aircraft from the A√©ronavale. The Indian Navy operated the Aliz√© from shore bases and from the light carrier . The Aliz√© was used for reconnaissance and patrol during India's 1961 liberation of Portuguese controlled Goa, and was also used for ASW patrol during the Indo- Pakistani War of 1971, during which one Aliz√© was shot down by a Pakistan Air Force F-104 Starfighter. It also sank three gunboats. The Aliz√© dwindled in numbers in the Indian Navy during the 1980s, was relegated to shore-based patrol in 1987. Nevertheless, they were employed that year in support of the Indian Peacekeeping Force's Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka, flying sorties against the LTTE and crippling the merchant ship Progress Light. The type was finally phased out in 1991, replaced in its duties by ASW helicopters. The A√©ronavale provided the Aliz√© with a series of upgrades. A modernization program performed in the early 1980s refitted 28 of the aircraft to the Br.1050M standard, featuring improved Thomson-CSF Iguane radar as used on the Atlantique NG ocean-patrol aircraft, new OMEGA radio navigation gear, and a new ARAR 12 radar and radio location (\\"electronic support measures / ESM\\") system. Another upgrade program in the early 1990s fitted 24 of these aircraft with a new decoy system; a microcomputer-based data processing system; a datalink system; and other new avionics. Later in the decade, they were also fitted with the Thomson-CSF TTD Optronique Chlio forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor. Despite the upgrades, by this time the Aliz√© was clearly not capable of hunting modern nuclear submarines, and so it was relegated to ocean surface patrol. As late as 1997, the A√©ronavale was still operating 24 examples for surface patrol. The Aliz√© was used operationally during the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo in early 1999, with the aircraft flying off the carrier Foch. The last Aliz√© was withdrawn from service in 2000 with the retirement of the Foch.

It was set up in 1884 in response to the attitude of the Football Association to the issue of professionalism. History Until the employment of professionals by Darwen and their success in reaching the quarter finals of the FA Cup in 1879, all teams had been amateur. There was a proposal by a London club before the match that any side not consisting entirely of amateurs should be barred from the Cup. The FA Cup was initially contested by mostly southern, amateur teams but more professionally organised northern clubs began to dominate the competition during the early 1880s; \\"The turning point, north replacing south, working class defeating upper and professionals impinging upon the amateurs' territory, came in 1883.\\" Hitherto, public school sides had played a dribbling game punctuated by violent tackles, but a new passing style developed in Scotland was successfully adopted by some Lancashire teams, along with a more professional approach to training. Blackburn Olympic reached the final in March 1883 and defeated Old Etonians. In 1883 Accrington were expelled from the FA for paying players, while nearby Blackburn Rovers had also started to pay players, and the following season won the first of three consecutive FA Cups. The FA initially tried to outlaw professionalism but, in the face of a threatened break-away association (the British Football Association was formed by 37 mainly northern and midlands-based clubs), was forced to permit payments to players in 1885Lewis, R.W. \\"'Touched Pitch and Been Shockingly Defiled': Football, Class, Social Darwinism and Decadence in England, 1880-1914\\", in Mangan, J.A. (1999) Sport in Europe: Politics, Class, Gender (Frank Cass, London), pp.117-143. (the first Football League, established in 1888, featured six teams from northwest England and six from the midlands). This action by the FA was eventually to lead to the break-away and formation of the Amateur Football Association in 1907. A similar split in rugby led to the separate sports of rugby union and rugby league.

The series was filmed in Burnaby, British Columbia. The series was created by Dan Signer (who also worked on shows such as The Suite Life on Deck and A.N.T. Farm), and stars Brendan Meyer, Matreya Fedor, and Gig Morton as attendees of Finnegan High School. Further main cast includes Kurt Ostlund, Emily Tennant, and Milo Shandel. The show ended its run on November 28, 2013 with three seasons and 80 episodes. Premise Mr. Young centers on Adam Young (Brendan Meyer), who graduated from university at the age of 14. He decides to come back to high school as a science teacher to live the high school \\"experience\\". He reunites with childhood best friend Derby (Gig Morton) and encounters the school bully, Slab (Kurt Ostlund), and a student in his class whom he has a crush on, named Echo (Matreya Fedor). However, because he is only 14, his students have little respect for him, and he often gets into trouble with the principal for his childlike behaviour. Episodes Cast and characters =Main= * Brendan Meyer as Adam Young. He is teaching science class at Finnegan High School. He wants to relive his life in high school because he graduated early and couldn't go to high school. But for him, life in high school is very difficult, as he lacks adequate social skills. He is also in love with one of his students, Echo. In almost every episode, Derby tries to help Adam impress Echo which all fail from Derby's impulsivity. Adam and Echo kiss in the 90 minute special (after a lot of work that makes him go back to or refer to previous episodes, such as Mr. Elephant, Mr. Magic and Mr. Dance), Mr. First Impression. In the finale, he's no longer in Finnegan and begins work at a local university as a professor. Adam Young is similar to Doogie Howser, M.D., who also graduated from high school and college at a young age. He started out as a science teacher at 15. * Matreya Fedor as Echo Zizzleswift. Echo is a student at Finnegan High School. She is in Adam's science class. Echo also cares deeply about the environment and other people. She is thoughtful, socially aware, a tad bit gullible, and secretly likes all things to do with science-fiction. She is good friends and sometimes enemies with Adam, Ivy, Derby and Slab. Adam has a crush on her, but she seems completely unaware of this (until in Mr. Double Date, where she discovers their mutual attraction). They kissed in the 90 minute special, Mr. First Impression. Her last name was announced in \\"Mr. College\\". She has a pet hamster named Mr. Tickleschmootz who later mated with Slab's hamster Slab Jr. In the finale, she graduates Finnegan and attends Adam's science class at a local university. * Gig Morton as Derby von Derbotsford. Derby is a dimwitted student at Finnegan High School. He has a crush on Ivy, Adam's sister, but is always rejected and ignored by her. He also has a tendency to wear and provide costumes and hosts a radio show called \\"Drive Time with Derby\\". Derby is Adam's best friend and also his student, a line that Derby's more than happy to blur; almost every time Adam teaches, he falls asleep as do many of the other students. Derby is a class clown and is skilled in pranking, with an alter ego \\"Gagmeister General\\". Principal Tater doesn't know the true identity of the \\"Gagmeister\\", even after Derby admitted to being him. In the 90-minute special, Mr. First Impression, he sings a song named \\"Derby Style\\", a parody of Gangnam Style. In the finale, he graduates from Finnegan and currently attends Adam's science class at a local university. * Kurt Ostlund as Jordan 'Slab' Slabinsky. Slab is the doltish bully of Finnegan High School. Though his behavior is aggressive, \\"Slab\\" likes doing ballet, looking at the stars, and friendship. Though he tends to pull pranks on people, and bullies nerds specifically, he says he does it to conceal his feelings. Even though he bullies Derby often by putting him in trash cans, he occasionally helps him out. Although he is a bully, he does have feelings for other people such as Brap, a girl raised by elephants who was subsequently changed into a stereotypical popular girl by Ivy. He also has a fear of milk. He has two gerbils, two guinea pigs and a hamster who mated with Echo's hamster Mr. Tickleschmootz, all named Slab Jr. In Mr. Memory, he starts dating Ivy. In the finale, after 12 years of high school, he finally graduates from Finnegan and currently attends Adam's science class at a local university. * Emily Tennant as Ivy Young. Ivy is Adam's rude elder sister. She loves shopping and bossing Adam around. She is very dimwitted. She tends to be rude to a lot of people, sometimes even to the teachers, although deep down she truly does care about Adam and other people and will help them out. She used to have a crush on Hutch Anderson, but begins dating Slab in Mr. Memory. Ivy is a stereotypical blonde and is considered attractive by all the male students. In the series finale, it was revealed she was a senior for 3 years. She also is a reporter for the school newspaper, along with Echo. In the series finale, she finally graduates from Finnegan and currently attends her brother's science class at a local university. * Milo Shandel as Principal George Tater. Principal Tater is the principal of Finnegan High School who often checks up on Mr. Young and his class. He is often suspicious and can be quite ditsy, scoring in the 15th percentile of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test. He is also afraid of cinnamon, after an incident during his childhood, and refers to his mother as \\"mommy\\". He is also disrespected by many students. It is implied that he may be the father of Adam and Ivy, due to their hair loss in an episode with a video in which Tater and their mother, Rachel, appear together. In the finale, after Adam revealed he was leaving Finnegan, he admitted he enjoyed Adam's teaching and making high school fun. =Recurring= * Raugi Yu as Dang. Dang is the school's janitor. He usually appears out of nowhere when people mention his name due to his sheer speed, which allows him to perform actions, such as playing beach volleyball, with himself. He is very skilled at martial arts and is also shown to have a passion for leaf monkeys, Halloween, and says the word \\"demon\\" for things like robots, calling them \\"steel demons\\". Occasionally he wears a giant purple cowboy hat with feathers, which he calls his \\"Fancy Hat\\". He lives at Finnegan High and almost never wants to leave because leaf monkeys do not live there, who would steal his fancy hat. Dang has a twin brother named Ding that he disliked because Ding married a duck named Shirley. Dang forgave his brother who was Echo disguised as Dang (Dang could not tell the difference between the disguised Echo and his brother) because he saw Slab's mother and exclaimed, \\"There are worse things to marry than duck!\\". In the finale, he finally earned his high school diploma from his final science project (his amazing speeding ability) and currently attends Adam's science class at a local university. * Paula Shaw as Ms. Byrne. Ms. Byrne is an elderly, clueless history teacher who is in charge of the science club and school newspaper. She has very bad memory, often shown to forget things that she saw or heard a few seconds ago. She always teaches the same thing every class: The War of 1812, always starting off with the question \\"Who has heard of the War of 1812?\\" before all the students raise their hands. It has also been suggested in several episodes that she is extremely old, though she disagrees. Notable examples include \\"Mr. Younger Man\\" where she claims to have seen Halley's Comet 6 times already, \\"Mr. Discovery,\\" where she is shown being alive in the prehistoric ages, and in \\"Mr. Servant\\", where she is seen to have been \\"Miss Constantinople. \\"Mr Summer Vacation\\" showed her complaining about having to put on sunscreen, causing Adam to ask if it was because she was born before people knew about the dangers of the sun, to which Ms. Byrne replied \\"No, before there was a sun!\\". She also uses ancient tools (for example, a 4000-year abacus instead of a computer, being seemingly ignorant of modern technology). It is revealed that her mother and even her grandmother are still alive and she also has many elderly grandchildren. In the finale, she swallowed some water from the Fountain of Youth, appearing young for a while. After it wore off, she began a relationship with Dang's mentor in Vietnam. * Anna Galvin as Rachel Young. Rachel is Ivy's and Adam's mother. She delivers meals to seniors and can sometimes be helpful. She can be overtly dishonest, claiming during the school carnival that there was a \\"giant man-eating chicken\\" in her booth when in reality there was only a tall man eating from a bucket of chicken. Rachel is shown on occasion to be indifferent to Adam's feelings, once selling his comic book collection without his knowledge. She was schoolmates with Principal Tater once and was framed and suspended for putting glue in the mascot costume which made Tater bald. She was also once a cheerleader at Finnegan High.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The Spanish colonizers, who surveyed the early settlers of the area, recorded the name \\"Bato\\" and later this became the town's name. There are several unproven theories when and why the town was named \\"Bato\\", like it came from the name of the \\"water Wells\\", or it came from the Tagalog word bato, meaning \\"rock\\". Another legend states that a Spaniard asked a settler woman the name of the settlement, and she replied \\"Bato\\". There is no certainty whether the woman understood the question or not, whether she referred to her own name or the name of the settlement itself, or to their early occupations of the area. Geography Bato is located at the south-eastern portion of Catanduanes and is bounded on the north by the municipality of San Miguel; on the north-east by the municipality of Baras; on the east by the Philippine Sea; on the south by Cabugao Bay and on the west of Virac, the capital town of Catanduanes which is just from Bato. =Geological feature= Stability and permeability of basic rock formation could be seen in the geologic map the existence of fault line along barangays Oguis, Sipi, Binanuahan, Cabugao and San Andres. These areas are considered critical especially in terms of development as urban expansion. Like other municipalities in the province of Catanduanes, Bato has many mineral deposits like gold, manganese, coal and copper. =Soil classification= The municipality of Bato is composed of five kinds of soils: hydrosol, mountain soil, alimodian clay loam, Louisiana clay, and San Miguel silt loam. =Slope= The elevation rises from sea level to about above sea level. The flat lands are mostly found along the coast of Cabugao Bay along the banks of the Bato River. These flat lands with a slope of 0-3% occupies an average area of 25-30% of the entire area of Bato. The Poblacion which is located along the eastern side of the Bato River is among the barangays having this slope, characterized to be level to nearly level land. However, due to its location, the Poblacion together with the adjoining barangays frequently suffer floods. The eastern portion of Bato which faces the Pacific Ocean has a slope ranging between 3-30% slope. These areas shield the lowlands of the municipality from the incoming winds of the Pacific. These areas are mostly planted with orchards, hard wood trees and abaca. =Bato River= A view of Bato River The Bato River stretches as far as Viga to Cabugao Bay. Once it was abundant in marine life but due to erosion and consistent flooding, the riverbed has been dumped with soil and this caused the river to get shallow and dry up. In the southern part of the Bato River is a delta, locally known as the Napo. Here farmers grow their agriculture such as peanuts, sweet potatoes, corn, beans, coconuts and palms. It is also the site for settling carabaos. The river divides Bato into the east and west district. The Bato bridge, the longest in the Bicol region, spans the river from Baranggay Tilis to Baranggay Sipi. The old bridge is located in Baranggay Balongbong, and it was destroyed during the flooding of supertyphoon Rosing in 1995. =Barangays= Bato is politically subdivided into 27 Barangays. * Aroyao Peque√±o * Bagumbayan * Banawang (Poblacion) * Batalay * Binanwahan * Bote * Buenavista * Cabugao * Cagraray * Carorian * Guinobatan * Libjo * Marinawa * Mintay * Oguis * Pananaogan * Libod (Poblacion) * San Andres * San Pedro * San Roque * Santa Isabel * Sibacungan * Sipi * Talisay * Tamburan (Poblacion) * Tilis * Ilawod (Poblacion) =Climate= Like other towns in the pacific island, Bato is frequented by typhoons. This can happen up to 20 times per year, with some typhoons developing into really devastating calamities that can level entire towns. Flooding ensues in the Poblacion due to the river overflowing its banks. Otherwise, the weather is a standard tropical weather, with the dry season settling in as early as January, and the wet season starting on June. Monsoon seasons pick up during the -ber months, in which the locals expect more typhoons to come. History It has been known that the early Muslim settlers came from Borneo and Malaysia during the 13th century before the Spanish colonization. Many of these Muslim settlers were traders and carried their names like \\"Bato\\" who started their settlements in the area and later spread to the other regions of Visayas, Mindanao, and Luzon. Many Bato's ascendants and descendant's names originated from the three Bato's places in the Philippines (the other two being Bato, Camarines Sur, and Bato, Leyte). Demographics In the , the population of Bato, Catanduanes, was people, with a density of . Services =Housing= With the present population of 19,269, Bato has 3,712 households, thereby placing the average family size at 5 members. It has a total of 3,667 occupied dwelling units. Of this dwelling units, 1,908 or 52.03% used concrete/brick/stone as their outer walls followed by bamboo/sawali/cogon and nipa which composes 29.42%. Asbestos/glass is the least used which accounts for only 7 houses or 0.19%. Dwelling units have also been classified into single houses, duplex, multi-unit residential, institutional, living quarters and others. Thus of the total number of households, 99% or 3,644 occupies single house while the rest of 1% are either duplex or multi unit residential. =Health= The municipality of Bato has two (2) major health facilities. These include one (1) hospital and one (1) rural health unit, which is located in Barangay Tamburan and Poblacion respectively. There used to be eight (8) barangay health stations located in barangays Batalay, Bote, San Roque, Bagumbayan, Buenavista, Binanuahan, Sibacungan, and Cagraray. The Bato Maternity and Children's Hospital which is under the administration of the Provincial Government of Catanduanes is catering to the needs of the three (3) municipalities, namely: Bato, Baras, and San Miguel. It has a capacity of 50 beds whose services include consultations, admissions and minor surgeries. On the other hand, the Rural Health unit, which is under the administration of the Municipal Government of Bato, serves the needs of the 27 barangays of the municipality. Its services are medical/surgical services, laboratory services, family planning and women's health services, oral rehydration therapy, TB Control, immunization, medico legal and social services, environmental health services, pre-marriage counseling, delivery calls and nutrition services. In 1999, the Office of the Municipal Civil Registrar posted a live birth of 307, 159 of which are males and 148 are females. Likewise it recorded 89 deaths in age group 50 years and over. The Municipal Health Office for the same year recorded a crude birth rate of 27.47% and an infant mortality rate of 0.83%. =Education= Almost 35.05% of the total population of the municipality or 7,415 comprises the school-going age population. The primary school-going population aged 6‚Äì10 years old are 2,570; the intermediate school-going population aged 11‚Äì12 years old are 993; the secondary school-going population aged 13‚Äì16 are 1,858 and the tertiary school-going population aged 17‚Äì21 are 1,994. A survey of the actual enrollment revealed that there is an enrollment participation rate of 90.43%. This could be interpreted that for every 100 children aged 6‚Äì14 only 90 are enrolled. For secondary education out of 1,858 only 1,359 are enrolled. A tertiary school is not present in the municipality, however post-secondary vocational courses are being offered by the school founded by then mayor, Andres T.Torres, the Cabugao School of Handicraft and Cottage Industries (CSHCI) which is now under the administration and management of the TESDA. Originally, CSHCI was established to cater free secondary education to the people of Cabugao and other neighboring barangays and municipalities. =Protective= Protective services are being served by the police force, the firemen and the barangay brigades. All in all these force totals 164, broken down as follows: 17 policemen, 4 firemen, and 143 members of the barangay brigades. There is a single fire engine for the Bato Fire Brigade, which also responds to fires in neighbouring towns (and when the incident is really disastrous, to other distant town within the island). Due to the absence of a PNP Building, the police station is located at the Municipal Hall. The Barangay Brigades of Bato with a force of 143 could be found all throughout the different barangays. =Social welfare= The municipality of Bato avails of the social welfare services of the government agency popularly known as the Department of Social Welfare and Development. This agency has two devolved personnel for Bato. Its services are extended to all the urban and rural barangays of the municipality and include among other: family life education and counseling, day care services, peer group service, supplemental feeding, relief rehabilitation and referral for medical care. The organizations present in this municipalities are: Senior Citizens Organization, Women's Organization and Parents Committee.

Then the people were disturbed by constant depredation of bandits coming from other places. The present site has been chosen because it was near the sea and the fishermen found it very convenient for their trade, however, being near the sea, it was vulnerable to Moros who always come to get their belongings or even capture some people. As a defense against such moro raids, the people planted pandan shrubs close to each other to form a formidable defense against invaders. When the Spaniards came they found the plants around the poblacion in great abundance. When asked what the name of the shrubs was, the people told them that they were pandan shrubs. Thus, the Spaniards called the place Pandan. The municipality lies on the northern tip of the province, 96 kilometers from the capital town of Virac. Bounded on the south by the municipality of Caramoran, on the west by the Maqueda Channel, on the east by the municipality of Bagamanoc and on the north by the Pacific Ocean. It has a total land area of 11,990 hectares. This is a town of 17,096 friendly and hospitable people, to which 99% are Roman Catholic. Of the 26 barangays that comprise the municipality, four of which actually form the town proper, which are Libod, the biggest barangay in terms of population, Napo, Pandan del Sur and Pandan del Norte. The rest are found usually near the seashore. The rest being an inland barangays. The municipality does not only boast of the natural beauties, it has which are the Parway, Mangbang, Parola beaches, the Hinik-Hinik falls (Hinik-hinik is a local term for rain shower) and Minaipit falls, but especially of its being a hometown of Senators, Congressman, Governor, Cardinal and Ambassador. The people of Pandan are generally peace-loving, God-fearing and are happy people. Everyone in the community is a brother, a sister and a friend where the products of which could be shared even food itself without thought of having it repaid or reciprocated. Visitors are offered the comforts that the family could afford even it means that the owner should lay on the floor just to make the visitor eased at home by using the ‚Äúpapag‚Äù. And that is not enough, before going home; products of their yard would be wrapped for you to bring in your family plus a bunch of cockling chickens. During celebrations, immediate neighbors are invited bringing among the whole members of the family and this seemed to be incomplete without tuba drinking and little dancing. Pantomina is a long cherished dance that never changes with time despite of the current dance and music. Pandananons has a series of collected pantomina songs which are now famous composed locally, of course it is not only the above songs, Pandananons used to compose, for evidence of which that gained popularity was a song composed by Alfredo dela Rosa, former Municipal Secretary of the Sangguniang Bayan of Pandan, entitled ‚ÄúIslang Catandungan‚Äù. This song won first place in the regional contest in Sorsogon sometime on the late 1960s. =Historical structures= The Pandan Church was built in 1874. the roof was completely razed by fire in a great conflagration of the town in 1920. This was repaired within five years during the incumbency of Father Jose Magno. The roof was again blown completely in 1940 by the strongest typhoon that has ever passed Catanduanes. It took many years to repair it; again, this was destroyed by typhoon Jean in 1947. Complete repair under the management of Father Orias was done near the end of 1953. =Old ruins= The only old ruin to be found in Pandan is the present Roman Catholic Cemetery. It was constructed during the Spanish era. Formerly, this cemetery was surrounded with concrete walls, which crumbled due to work of time and element. At present, very little portion of the walls remain. The outstanding events that took place in Pandan during the Spanish regime may be divided into five different aspects, namely; social, political, religious, educational, health and sanitation. =Social and political= The system of governing the town was carried and through the so-called capitan or gobernadorcillo, which at present is called a municipal mayor. He was assisted in the administration of the town by the coadelieros, cabeza de barangay and aguacil who are now called policemen, councilor and barrio lieutenants or barrio captains now barangay captains respectively. During those days land taxes were unknown. Once a person had paid his personal tax which amounted to P1.50, he was exempted from paying taxes of any kind. Rape, robbery and killing were the greatest crimes during those days, and the penalty of offenders was death by hanging. Penalties for minor offenses like failure to clean one‚Äôs surroundings consisted only of confining the guilty in the tribunal, now called the municipal building. Those found guilty were made to stand in a ‚Äúpandog‚Äù all day long and given several beatings. One thing unique about the Spanish Administration was the equality with which penalties were administered, because no matter what key positions in town one was holding, once he was guilty of any crime he was punished relentlessly. =Religious= On e commendable trend of the time was the people‚Äôs strict adherence to their religious duties and practices. During Sundays at 7:00 o‚Äôclock in the evening a curfew bell in the Tribunal would be sounded, after which nobody was expected to be seen lingering around the town, otherwise, if anybody was caught by the cuadelieros (policemen), he was given a hundred lashes. During curfew hours everybody was expected to be in their respective houses singing such holy songs as the so-called ‚Äútarahadi‚Äù =Educational= There were very few teachers in the town, because teachers were still to be imported from the mainland. There was no such thing as principal, district supervisor, division superintendent because the administration of the school was solely the teacher‚Äôs responsibility. During examination time the governor who was the over-all head of the province would just come over and gave oral examination to the pupils. Severe and inhuman corporal punishment was the order of the day and woe to those who were rather slow in learning their daily lessons. Teaching consisted mostly of religious, a little of handwork and Spanish. =Health and sanitation= One accomplishment achieved along this line was the rigid enforcement of cleanliness of the immediate vicinity of the house. When one is found delinquent of his duty he is hog-tied and given a hundred lashes. Whenever the governor of the province visited the town and discovered that some streets were not properly cared for, it was the capitan who suffered the penalty of being fined. =American occupation and World War II= The first American came to this town in the year 1900 under Captain Mane. The people did not offer resistance to the occupation of the Americans, so there was no fighting between the natives and the Americans. The natives were at first afraid of the American soldiers. They thought that the Americans might abuse them. When the natives observed the Americans began their policy of attraction by giving their foods to the natives. They offered cakes and candies to the children. The Americans with the help of the prominent people organized the government. The municipal mayor or ‚Äúcapitan‚Äù as was called during those days was voted by the male inhabitants who were 21 years old or above. A male may be qualified to vote if he possessed any of the following (1) he must be 21 years old or above; (2) he could read and write; (3) and if he owned a piece of land. The first capitan who was elected was Capitan Eduardo Vera. The Americans organized public schools. They selected big houses for schools buildings. The first teachers were Americans. The most popular among them was Catler. The Americans gave pencils, paper and slates to the pupils in order to encourage the people to get to school. Even the adults were encouraged to go to school. The subjects taught were English, Language, Arithmetic, Reading and Writing. The Americans taught the natives healthful and sanitary living. They taught the people to clean their homes and surroundings and to make toilets. They established a provisional hospital wherein the soldiers and even natives were treated free by the American doctors. The Americans stayed in the place for about a year. When they left the same system of government was instituted. The mayor or capitan was elected by the qualified voters. The town was improved when Pedro Vera became the Representative of this province in 1928. Schools, roads and bridges were constructed. The Post Office, the Light House, and the present schools in this town today are some of the improvements done through the effort of Vera. The dike that prevents the destruction of the town was constructed through the effort of Rep. Pedro Vera. In 1950 there was drought and the people suffered because there was no harvest of rice. In 1935 there was another typhoon but it was not very strong. the second World War broke out in December 1941. Pandan is the home town of Former Senator Jose O. Vera, Rep. Pedro Vera, Former Governor Jorge V. Almojuela, Cardinal Jose T. Sanchez, Former Ambassador and Immigration Commissioner Leandro I. Verceles (the first Bicolano career diplomat), Former Congressman and Governor Leandro B. Verceles, Jr., Former Vice Governor Teofisto I. Verceles and Former Governor Araceli B. Wong.

The Gravitron first appeared at Morey's Piers in 1983 and quickly became a fixture at amusement parks in many countries. It is a modification of an earlier ride called the Rotor. The ride was originally designed and manufactured by Wisdom Industries, though several examples of the Gravitron were produced under license by ARM in the UK and Ferrari in Australia. Design and operation A Starship 2000 at Night at The Western Fair in London, Ontario, Canada ‚Äì September 2004 The ride is completely enclosed, with 48 padded panels lining the inside wall. Riders lean against these panels, which are angled back. As the ride rotates, centrifugal force is exerted against the pads by the rider, removing the rider from the floor, due to the slant. The ride can reach a maximum speed of 24 rpm in less than 20 seconds, due to the 33 kW 3-phase motor. At this speed, the riders are experiencing centrifugal force equivalent to three times the force of gravity. There is usually a light-up sign on it which usually says \\"THRILLER\\" but sometimes this will say the name of the show. On some models, this is not on the ride. The ride operator is located in the center of the ride. Part of the operator's duty is to control lighting and music in addition to the ride itself. Some variants include closed-circuit television cameras, allowing waiting riders and passersby to observe the ride in action. There are a few versions of this ride that do not have a ceiling (i.e. the top canvas is not installed). The entire ride racks on a single trailer for transport. The ride can be assembled in less than six hours, and packed up in three. Incidents On August 20, 1991, a Gravitron spun itself apart at the Missouri State Fair, injuring seven children. The accident led to a multi-party lawsuit against Murphy Enterprises, the operator of the ride, and Wisdom Manufacturing, resulting in modifications to the rides and stricter safety standards. In April 2004, an accident occurred at the Dade County Youth Fair in Miami, Florida, when a panel came off and three riders were ejected. One of these ejected riders was a 16-year-old girl who was critically injured. Seven people were injured, including two people outside the ride that were hit by debris. As a result, DCYF strengthened their safety guidelines and removed the ride from the park. On September 8, 2007, a teenage boy was injured while riding a Gravitron at the Spokane County Interstate Fair in Washington State. The boy hit his head on a metal part of the ride and needed two staples in his scalp to close the wound. Witnesses reported that the boy ignored safety warnings and climbed the walls of the ride while it was in motion. State investigators determined that the ride was safe and that the accident was the result of the victim's behavior.

Family Weigall was the fifth son of a Victorian artist, Henry Weigall (best known for his portrait of Benjamin Disraeli in 1878‚Äì1879), and his wife, Lady Rose Sophia Mary Fane, daughter of John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, and wife Priscilla Anne Wellesley-Pole. Through his mother, he was connected to several powerful aristocratic dynasties. One of his older brothers was the cricketer Gerry Weigall (born Gerald John Villiers Weigall). Two other brothers, Louis and Evelyn, were also first-class cricketers. He married 16 August 1910 in Metheringham, Lincolnshire, a divorcee, Grace Emily, Baroness von Echardstein, n√©e Grace Emily Blundell Maple (St. George Hanover Square, London, 1876‚Äì1950), only surviving child of the deceased furniture magnate Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet (1845‚Äì1903), who had left a fortune of ¬£2,153,000, and wife Emily Harriet Merryweather. She was the former wife of Baron Hermann von Eckardstein (1864‚Äì1933) of the German Embassy (whom she had married in 1896).Ordinarily, a marriage to a divorcee would have wrecked his career. By his wife, Weigall had one daughter; his wife also suffered several miscarriages, including in Australia. Their country residence was 'Englemere' at Ascot in Berkshire. His daughter Priscilla Crystal Frances Blundell Weigall married on 23 July 1935 Edward Richard Assheton Penn Curzon, CBE (1908‚Äì1984), son and heir of Francis Richard Henry Penn Curzon, 5th Earl Howe and wife and cousin Mary Curzon. They had two daughters before they divorced in 1943. She married secondly Robert Coriat, born Harold Isaac Coriat (b. Mogador), son of Abraham Coriat and wife Donna Florence \\"Flora\\" Cazes (b. London, Middlesex), daughter of Isaac Juave Cazes and wife Selina Simha or Semah Corcos, who were from Morocco, all Sephardi Jews. Their daughter, British socialite Susan Ann Caroline Coriat married Thomas Evelyn \\"Tommy\\" Weber (originally Thomas Ejnar Arkner), a race car driver who also came from a wealthy family. His father was born in Denmark, of Danish and English descent, son of Poul Arkner, born Poul Christian Anderson (b. Denmark) and wife Pamela Joyce Weber (b. Hertford, Hertfordshire), daughter of Reginald Evelyn Weber and wife Joyce Warner. Weigall's great-grandson is British actor Jake Weber. Early life and military career Educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, Weigall became an estate manager. He joined the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment (the Northampton and Rutland Militia). He was promoted to Captain on 4 April 1902, when the battalion left for South Africa as reinforcement for what turned out to be the last stages of the Second Boer War. Following the end of the war in June 1902, Weigall and the other men of the 3rd battalion left Cape Town on the SS Scot in early September, and returned to Northampton after arrival in the United Kingdom later the same month. He was later promoted to Major. In World War I, he served with the Northamptonshire Regiment and on the Staff, finishing with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Political career Captain Archibald G. Weigall unsuccessfully fought the seat of Gainsborough for the Conservatives at the December 1910 general election. He stood successfully in a by-election at Horncastle in Lincolnshire on 16 February 1911. The by-election was caused by the sitting Conservative MP Lord Willoughby de Eresby, who had held Horncastle at each election since 1895The Times, 26 December 2010 succeeding to the peerage on the death of his father, Earl Ancaster. He received 4,955 votes, with a majority of 107 over the Liberal, Frederick Caesar Linfield. He remained an MP until he resigned in 1920 to become Governor. Governor of South Australia Sir George Murray, Lieutenant Governor and Justice Angas Parsons at a garden party held in the grounds of Government House, Adelaide In 1919, Weigall accepted an appointment as Governor of South Australia. He was appointed in 1920, and soon left for Adelaide, arriving in June. He very quickly became disenchanted with the State Parliament; he became extremely frustrated with the way in which ministers would spend money before being granted supply, or transfer funds voted for one purpose to another. Although never explicitly calling for the abolition of the States, he did describe the results of the division of power in Australia as being \\"farcical\\" and \\"chaotic\\", and concluded that \\"State Governors and State Legislatures are now anachronisms\\".Australian Dictionary of Biography entry Weigall sought leave to resign in December 1921, citing \\"personal and financial\\" reasons. The Colonial Office had wrongly informed him that the State Government would pay the wages of his staff. This was not the case, and this left Weigall a wage of merely ¬£300. His departure prompted Premier Henry Barwell to raise the Governor's salary. Due to the times, many of the war memorials in country towns around South Australia were opened by him as he travelled around the state, it being only a few years after the end of World War I. These include laying the foundation stone at Burra, unveiling the memorial at Hallett, and opening the new tennis courts at the Memorial Drive Tennis Centre in Adelaide. Weigall Oval in the suburb of Plympton, and Weigall (formerly Woolshed Flat) along the River Murray were both named in his honour. Later honours He was appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1926‚Äì27. Weigall was created a Baronet, Weigall of Woodhall Spa, in 1938, and was made King of Arms of the Order of St Michael and St George also in 1938. He was appointed High Sheriff of Berkshire for 1944‚Äì45. Since he had no sons, his Baronetcy died with him.

However, most civil defense devices were ion-chamber radiological survey meters capable of measuring only high levels of radiation that would be present after a major nuclear event. Most Geiger and ion-chamber survey meters were issued by governmental civil defense organizations in several countries from the 1950s in the midst of the Cold War in an effort to help prepare citizens for a nuclear attack. Many of these same instruments are still in use today by some states, Texas amongst them, under the jurisdiction of the Texas Bureau of Radiation Control. They are regularly maintained, calibrated and deployed to fire depts and other emergency services. US models Victoreen Civil Defence V-777-1 shelter radiation detection kit overview CD Counters came in a variety of different models, each with specific capabilities. Each of these models has an analog meter from 1 to 5, with 1/10 tick marks. Thus, at X10, the meter reads from 1 to 50. CD meters were produced by a number of different firms under contract. Victoreen, Lionel, Electro Neutronics, Nuclear Measurements, Chatham Electronics, International Pump and Machine Works, Universal Atomics, Anton Electronic Laboratories; Landers, Frary, & Clark; El Tronics, Jordan, and Nuclear Chicago are among the many manufacturers contracted. Regardless of producer, most counters exhibit the same basic physical characteristics, albeit with slight variations between some production runs: a yellow case with black knobs and meter bezels. Most US meters had a \\"CD\\" sticker on the side of the case. True Geiger counters These are instruments which use the Geiger principle of detection. =Type CDV-700= The CD V-700 is a Geiger counter employing a probe equipped with a Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller tube manufactured by several companies under contract to US federal civil defense agencies in the 1950s and 1960s. This unit is quite sensitive and can be used to measure low levels of Gamma radiation and detect Beta radiation. In cases of high-radiation fields, the Geiger tube can saturate, causing the meter to read a very low level of radiation (close to 0 R/h) hence the necessity of the companion ion-chamber survey meters. =Type CDV-718= The CD V-718 is a variation of the US military-issue AN/VDR-2 RADIAC made by Nuclear Research Corporation, located in the US State of New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) purchased a quantity of CD V-718s in the 1990s as a supplement to and partial replacement for the older meters in the inventory. The CD V-718 differs from the military AN/VDR-2 primarily by being painted bright \\"civil defense\\" yellow instead of olive green and being graduated in R√∂ntgens rather than Grays. A much more modern and sophisticated device than earlier CD meters and equipped with a probe containing two Geiger-Mueller tubes of differing sensitivities, the CD V-718 can cover a much wider range of radiation levels than the earlier Geiger counters and ion-chamber survey meters combined (from .001mR/h to 10,000 R/h). As a result of its military heritage, the CD-V-718 is far more rugged than earlier CD meters, and can easily be mounted in vehicles.http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/civildefense/cdv718.htm Ion- chamber survey meters These are instruments using the ionisation chamber principle. If the meter on any of the ion chamber devices are observed to respond at all to a radiation source, evacuation of the area should be considered. No legally exempt source of gamma radiation would be expected to cause any visible deflection of the meter on its most sensitive setting, so it might be assumed that such a radiation field could be dangerous. Such a meter would not be expected to detect the presence of radiation except the very high levels that might be found in the event of a nuclear weapon detonation or a major release of radioactive material as from a nuclear reactor meltdown. The CD V ion chamber units are now all approaching 50 years old at a minimum and that they contain parts that are sensitive to moisture, so relatively frequent calibration and inspection by an accredited and properly equipped facility is required to ensure reliable and accurate function. =Type CDV-715= An example of the CD V-715 survey meter. By far the most common US civil defense meter on the market today. This is a simple ion chamber radiological survey meter, specifically designed for high-radiation fields for which Geiger counters will give incorrect readings (see above). Survey meters do not read alpha or beta radiation. They work by radiation penetrating the case of the unit and the enclosed ionization chamber to produce a visible reading between 0.1R/h and 500R/h (X0.1, X1, X10, and X100 scales). The CDV-715 ion chamber controls a subminiature type 5886 tube, but no 22.5 volt batteries are necessary for the B circuit of this tube. A transistor oscillator coupled to a step-up transformer furnishes the necessary B current for the tube, with necessary rectifier diodes and filter capacitors. The entire unit is thus powered by a single 1.5 volt D cell. =Type CD V-717= The Civil Defense CD V-717 with detachable ionization chamber deployed. Ionization chamber portion sits atop yellow anti-contamination bag. Similar to the CD V-715, this unit reads from 0.1R/h to 500R/h. It is also a survey meter with an ionization chamber, however this unit's chamber is detachable for hanging outside your shelter or basement. When used, the ionization chamber would be inserted into a yellow anti-contamination bag, tied off, and hung outside a bomb shelter to measure radioactivity levels from a safe distance. An extension coaxial cord, typically stored inside the unit, is then run from the outdoor chamber to the indoor meter. The coaxial spool is used to prop the meter up for reading. This would allow those hiding to wait until outside radiation levels have fallen to a \\"safe\\" level before emerging. When using the extension cable, the accuracy of the meter can be slightly reduced to plus or minus 20%. =Type CD V-720= An example of the CD V-720 survey meter, turned upside down, showing the retractable beta shield. Similar to the CD V-715, the CD V-720 is a fixed- position ionization chamber survey meter. Unlike any other survey meter, however, this unit has a movable beta shield on the bottom of the unit for detecting high levels of beta radiation. When slid to the open position, beta particles are allowed to directly penetrate the ionization chamber. With the beta shield closed, only gamma rays can penetrate both the shield and ionization chamber. This meter reads from 1R/h to 500R/h (X1, X10, and X100 scales). The CD V-720 was produced in 4 models (1,2,3, and 3A), Chatham made the model 1, Landeds Fray and Clark made the model 3 (along with Victoreen Instruments), and Victoreen Instruments made all other models. All but the Victoreen model 3 and model 3A used a combination of D and 22.5 volt B batteries, while the Victoreen models 3 and 3A just used 2 D batteries. By 1962 113,231 had been procured, but in September 1985 FEMA declared all models except the Victoreen model 3 and model 3A obsolete. =Type CD V-710= The CD V-710 was another high range survey meter, however, unlike the CD V-720, CD V-715, and CD V-717 its scale is only 0-50 R/H (0-0.5, 0-5, and 0-50) making it more of a mid range meter, however it is still far too high to respond to any exempt sources. The CD V-710 was made in 5 different versions from 1955 to at least 1958, the model 1 was produced by El-Tronics, models 2 and 4 were produced by Jorden Electronics, and models 3 and 5 were produced by Victoreen Instruments, models 1-3 were metal, and 4 and 5 were plastic. All versions of the CD V-710 use a combination of D batteries and obsolete 22.5 volt B batteries. By 1959, 170,750 were procured, however the model was ultimately superseded by the CD V-715 and in September 1985 FEMA issued instructions that remaining CD V-710s should be disposed of as obsolete. = Kearny fallout meter = Another meter of note is the Kearny fallout meter. The plans for this meter were published in Appendix C of Nuclear War Survival Skills by Cresson Kearny from research performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It was designed to be able to be constructed from household materials by someone with moderate mechanical ability on the eve of an attack. The plans are presented in a newspaper printable format. British civil defence instruments The United States manufactured approximately 500,000 Geiger counters. Britain manufactured about 20,000 of each of its major types, and is second after the U.S. Some instruments were also manufactured by other countries in smaller numbers. The American instruments dating from the Kennedy administration era were designed to use low voltage transistor electronics, and the batteries are still available today. However, most British civil defence instruments retained until 1982 or later were manufactured from 1953-7, and required high voltage batteries which became obsolete after portable valve radios were superseded by transistor ones. All British civil defence instruments were jointly designed by the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, and were also a military issue. =Contamination Meter No. 1= A British Meter, Contamination, No. 1 set, lacking headphones and haversack. The first large scale British civil defence issue was the Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller counter Meter, Contamination, No. 1 set ‚Äî stock number \\"5CG0012\\", of 1953.http://civildefensemuseum.com/southrad/brit-meter-1a.html It had 0‚Äì10 mR/hour range with external probe and headphones. This was designed to use two 1.50 volt batteries, although later they were fitted with an inverter which used four 1.35 volt mercury cells or, alternatively, a mains electricity power pack. Many of these units remained in service until the 1980s. There was also a Mk. 2 model which used rubber connectors and cable for the probe unit, compared to the Plessey connectors of the Mk.1. This used cold-cathode valves and very high impedance circuitry throughout to extend useful battery life as long as possible with the existing technology. =Radiac Survey Meter= RSM No.2 The British \\"Radiac Survey Meter No. 2\\"http://civildefensemuseum.com/southrad/brit-meter-2.html dates from 1953‚Äì1956, and required now-obsolete 15 and 30 volt high voltage batteries and a 1.5 volt standard cell, the latter used to power the valve heater filaments and meter illumination bulb). There was also a training unit,http://civildefensemuseum.com/southrad/brit-meter-1.html which measured 0‚Äì300 mR/h, and ran on four 30 volt batteries plus one 1.5V cell for the filaments. This meter used a large Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller tube, as opposed to the ionisation chamber of the RSM No. 2. These meters were favoured, as they had been tested on fallout in Australia after Operation Buffalo nuclear tests, and were retained until 1982 by commissioning a manufacturer to regularly produce special production runs of the obsolete batteries. The UK's Royal Observer Corps initially used the RSM No. 2 as its prime radiation detector until it was replaced by the specially-designed \\"Fixed Survey Meter\\", which used the same obsolete high voltage batteries as the RSM. The ROC retained the RSM No. 2 for use during external \\"post-attack\\" mobile monitoring surveys. =PDRM82= Plessey PDRM82 Plessey PDRM82F In 1982 the British PDRM82 was issued for civil defence. This model is lightweight, with an LCD display and a plastic case, and has all the electronics, including miniature Geiger tube (shielded against beta particles), on a single, EMP-hardened, PCB. It was designed by Plessey to use three standard 1.5 volt cells, and is microprocessor controlled with digital readout. For use by the Royal Observer Corps, the instrument was also provided in the fixed version designated the PDRM82(F). The fixed version had an external coaxial socket mounted on its rear that accepted a cable from the above ground ionisation detector under a polycarbonate dome. For training purposes, timed simulated readings could be fed to the meter from an EPROM. =Quartz fibre dosimeter chargers= The 1958‚Äì1959 \\"Quartz Fibre Dosimeter Chargers, No. 1 and 2\\" were retained until the early 1990s, as they incorporate a simple, handle-driven generator and do not require batteries at all. A later British civil defence dosimeter charger was developed by R. A. Stephen Ltd and manufactured from 1967 to 1988, and uses a single 1.5 volt cell. It is similar to American dosimeter chargers.

It was founded as a walled city named Shahjahanabad in 1639, when Shah Jahan (the Mughal emperor at the time) decided to shift the Mughal capital from Agra. The construction of the city was completed in 1648, and it remained the capital of the Mughal Empire until its fall in 1857,History of Mughal Architecture By R. Nath, Abhinav Publications, 2006City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi By William Dalrymple, Olivia Fraser, HarperCollins, 1993 when the British Raj took over as paramount power in India. It was once filled with mansions of nobles and members of the royal court, along with elegant mosques and gardens. Despite having become extremely crowded and inundated today, it still serves as the symbolic heart of metropolitan Delhi and is known for its bazaars, street food, shopping locations and its Islamic architecture; Jama Masjid being the most notable example, standing tall in the midst of the old city. Only a few havelis are left and maintained. Upon the 2012 trifurcation of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Old Delhi became administered by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.  History  Busy streets near Jama Masjid, Old Delhi. View of Old Delhi from Jama Masjid in June 1973. Jama Masjid built by Shah Jahan, 1656. The site of Shahjahanabad is north of earlier settlements of Delhi. Its southern part overlaps some of the area that was settled by the Tughlaqs in the 14th century when it was the seat of Delhi Sultanate. The sultanates ruled from Delhi between 1206 and 1526, when the last was replaced by the Mughal dynasty. The five dynasties were the Mamluk dynasty (1206‚Äì90), the Khalji dynasty (1290‚Äì1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320‚Äì1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414‚Äì51), Lodi dynasty (1451‚Äì1526) and the Suri dynasty (1540-1556) Delhi remained an important place for the Mughals, who built palaces and forts. Most importantly, Shah Jahan had the walled city built from 1638 to 1649, containing the Lal Qila and the Chandni Chowk. Delhi was one of the original twelve subahs (imperial Mughal provinces), renamed Shahjahanabad in 1648, bordering Awadh, Agra, Ajmer, Multan and Lahore subahs. Daryaganj had the original cantonment of Delhi, after 1803, where a native regiment of Delhi garrison was stationed, which was later shifted to Ridge area. East of Daryaganj was Raj ghat Gate of the walled city, opening at Raj Ghat on Yamuna River.Fanshawe, p. 67 The first wholesale market of Old Delhi opened as the hardware market in Chawri Bazaar in 1840, the next wholesale market was that of dry fruits, spices and herbs at Khari Baoli, opening in 1850. The Phool Mandi (Flower Market) of Daryaganj was established in 1869, and even today, despite serving a small geographical area, it is of great importance due to dense population. After the fall of the Mughal Empire post 1857 revolt, the British Raj shifted the capital of British controlled territories in India to a less volatile city, Calcutta in Bengal, where it remained until 1911. After the announcement of the change, the British developed Lutyens' Delhi (in modern New Delhi) just south-west of Shahjahanabad. At this point, the older city started being called Old Delhi, as New Delhi became the seat of a national government. It was formally inaugurated as such in 1931.  Walls and gates  Shahjahanabad or Old Delhi, 1911 map The City of Delhi Before the Siege - The Illustrated London News Jan 16, 1858 Historic map of Delhi (Shahjahanabad), 1863 It is approximately shaped like a quarter c√¨rcle, with the Red Fort as the focal point. The old city was surrounded by a wall enclosing about , with 14 gates:http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/01-15Jun04-Print- Edition/011506200496.htm Dilli's gates and windows By Mahtab Jahan # Nigambodh Gate: northeast, leading to historic Nigambodh Ghat on the Yamuna River # Kashmiri Gate: north # Mori Gate: north # Kabuli gate: west # Lahori gate: west close to the Sadar Railway station, Railway Colony, including the tomb of Syed Abdul Rehman Jilani Dehlvi.

The surrounding walls, wide and tall, originally of mud, were replaced by red stone in 1657. In the Mughal period, the gates were kept locked at night. The walls have now largely disappeared,Showers bring down ASI-protected wall in Old Delhi , ExpressIndia (web-site), The Indian Express, 2003-07-19 but most of the gates are still present. The township of old Delhi is still identifiable in a satellite image because of the density of houses. The Khooni Darwaza, south of Delhi Gate and just outside the walled city, was originally constructed by Sher Shah Suri. =Streets and neighbourhoods= Czech. The main street, now termed Chandni Chowk, runs from the Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. Originally a canal ran through the middle of the street. North of the street, there is the mansion of Begum Samru, now called Bhagirath Palace. South of the street is Dariba Kalan, a dense residential area, beyond which is Jama Masjid. Daryaganj is a section that used to border the river at Rajghat and Zeenat-ul-Masjid. The Urdu language emerged from the Urdu Bazaar section of Old Delhi. The Din Dunia magazine and various other Urdu publications are the reason for this language staying alive.Ghalib, 1797-1869: In 2vols.Vol.1, Life and Letters, By Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, Ghalib, Asad-AllƒÅh ·∏™ƒÅn Mƒ´rzƒÅ ƒ†ƒÅlib, Ralph Russell, Khurshidul Islam Published by Allen & Unwin, 1969 Its main arteries are * Netaji Subhash Marg / Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg leading to India Gate (north and south) * Chandni Chowk/Khari Bawli Road (east and west) Old Delhi is approximately bounded by these modern roads: * Nicholson Road (north) * Mahatma Gandhi Marg (east) * Shraddhananda Marg (west) * Jawaharlal Nehru Marg (south)  Old Delhi in 1876  Lahori Gate of Red Fort from Chandni Chowk. In 1876, Carr Stephen described the city as follows:Carr Stephen, Archaeology and Monumental Remains of Delhi (Author, 1876), pp. 246-47 Of the two streets described by Fran√ßois Bernier, the longer extended from the Lahore Gate of the city to the Lahore Gate of the citadel, and the other from the Delhi Gate of the city to the Lahore Gate of the fort. Both these streets were divided into several sections, each of which was known by a different name. The section between the Lahore Gate of the fort and the entrance of the street called the Dariba, known as the Khuni Darwazah, was called the Urdu or the Military Bazaar; owing, very probably, to the circumstances of a portion of the local garrison having been once quartered about the place. Between the Khuni Darwazah and the present Kotwali, or the Head Police Station of the city, the street has the name of Phul ka Mandi or the flower market. The houses in front of the Kotwali were built at a short distance from the line of the rest of the houses in the street, to form a square. Between the Kotwali and the gate known as the Taraiah, was the Jauhari or the Jewellers' Bazaar; between the Taraiah and the neighborhood is known as Asharfi ka Katra, was, par excellence, the Chandni Chowk. There was a tank in the center of the Chowk the site of which is now occupied by the Municipal Clock Tower, and beyond this to the Fatehpuri Masjid was the Fatehpuri Bazaar. The houses around Chandni Chowk were of the same height, and were ornamented with arched doors and painted verandahs. To the north and south of the square, there were two gate-ways, the former leading to the Sarai of Jehan Ara Begum, and the latter to one of the most thickly populated quarters of the city. Round the tank, the ground was covered with vegetable, fruit, and sweetmeat stalls. Over time the whole of this long street came to be known as the Chandni Chauk. This grand street was laid out by Jahanara Begum, daughter of Shah Jahan. From the Lahore Gate of the fort to the end of the Chandni Chauk the street was about 40 yards wide and 1,520 yards long. Through the center of this street ran the canal of 'Ali Mardan, shaded on both sides by trees. On the eastern end of the Chandni Chauk stands the Lahore Gate of the Fort, and on the opposite end the handsome mosque of Fatehpuri Begam. The clock tower no longer exists, although the location is still called Ghantaghar. The Sarai of Jehan Ara Begum has been replaced by the city hall. The kotwal is now adjacent to Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib. In literature The engraving accompanying Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem The City of Delhi, appears to show the Jama Masjid with an elephant on the open ground before it. She associates the city's past glories with tales of enchantment, namely James Ridley's The Tales of the Genii (Sir Charles Mansell).

Old Delhi is the seat of the Mughal Empire for over two centuries has come to the modern hub of Mughlai cuisine. Karim's, a restaurant described as the city's most famous culinary destination, is near the Jama Masjid. The Gali Paranthe Wali and Ghantewala halwai are also situated here. Chawri Bazaar is one of the oldest markets in Delhi, dating back to the 17th century and was before known as a hardware market, but is known nowadays for its wholesale paper products. Old Delhi is also known for its street food. Chandni Chowk and Chawri Bazaar areas have many street joints that sell spicy chaat (tangy and spicy snacks).  Culinary history  Old Delhi has certain identifiable landmarks of food. These include: = Paranthe Wali Gali = Pandit Gaya Prasad shifted from Agra to Delhi in 1876, in search of a better life. In Delhi, he set up a single shop business selling hot paranthas. The product gained popularity to an extent where he has required the aid of his family members for help in the production. Eventually, Paranthe wali Gali, the lane in which the original shop was came to house 16 of them. It is now run by the families of Pandit Gaya Prasad and his relatives. The sixth-generation continues to run the four of the sixteen original shops that remain. = Karim's = Having been in the business of catering to Mughal Emperors, the family that runs it was displaced following the Revolt of 1857. In 1911, Haji Karimuddin moved back to Delhi with inspiration to open a Dhaba to cater to people coming to witness the coronation from all across the country. It was in 1913 that he established the Karim Hotel in Gali Kababian, Jama Masjid. Karim's exists here today to cater to the wants of people from all over the country and the world, being a major tourist attraction. =Kallu Nihari= Nihari is a traditional meat stew that is slowly cooked to preserve its taste and the tenderness of its ingredients. Kallu Nihari is a shop in Old Delhi that has served the dish exclusively since it was opened by the late Mohammed Rafiquddin (better known as Kallu Mian) in 1990. The shop, which is well known in the area, has served millions of portions. = Harnarains = Harnarain Gokalchand was a pickle and murabba shop that was originally established in Khari Baoli by the name Harnarain Gopinath in 1857. It is often considered to be one of India's first commercially available pickle brands and was at the time India's largest food preservers. Their pickles and sharbat have been a household delicacy for over a century and a half, and have even served Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Having started from a small shop in Khari Baoli, Old Delhi, it has now become a global brand that goes by the name Harnarains International. = Banta = Characterised by a codd-neck bottle, Banta is a drink that has survived in Old Delhi since 1872. The glass bottle in which this comes has a marble stopper, which is pushed into the bulbous neck of the bottle to unseal it. Engineer Hiram Codd patented the design of the bottle in 1872 in London to effectively seal fizzy drinks. The Banta bottles even contributed to the Indian National movement. This was so as protestors and rioters would often use these bottles as improvised cannons by adding calcium hydroxide to the mix. Thus, the bottles were banned in many cities across the country at some point before 1947. = Giani di Hatti = Located on Church Mission Road in the busy Fatehpuri Market of Old Delhi, Giani di Hatti was started by Giani Gurcharan Singh in 1951. Following partition, Giani Gurcharan Singh migrated from Layalpur, now in Pakistan, to Delhi. He came while leaving an eatery there to start one here. Arriving with his recipe for iced rabdi falooda, large crowds still flock to the shop to get a taste of that unique flavor. Apart from this, the shop also sells various fruit juices and an assortment of main dishes, not to mention over 50 flavors of ice cream. Change in times can be recorded just by studying this shop as the same rabri falooda that was sold for 4 annas in 1951 is today sold for 80 Rupees. The third generation of the family looks after the establishment now, which remains popular as ever, with visitors coming all the way to the market just to eat here. It's a great place. = Moti Mahal = Moti Mahal was founded by Kundan Lal Gujral, Thakur Dass and Kundan Lal Jaggi, in Delhi in 1947. Initially, they worked at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named 'Mokha Singh' in Peshawar, British India, from 1920s to 1947.Moti Mahal was the first to dig up a tandoor right in the middle of the eatery and since then Peshawar was introduced to the culinary art of tandoori chicken by them. This was a success and soon there was in demand for Tandoori Chicken at social gatherings and wedding feasts where they would use an improvised tandoor. Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Dass, the founders of the restaurant, are credited with the invention of the dish. After the partition of India in 1947, they fled to Delhi with their family.In Delhi, the 3 partners bought a thara (booth) in Daryaganj area, then considered a newer part of Old Delhi and then they started Moti Mahal, Daryaganj Moti Mahal further went on to invent butter chicken and dal makhani.This brought about a revolution in taste and a place on the International Gourmet Map. Thus was born the Moti Mahal Restaurant, which contributed significantly to putting India on the food map of the world.Indian leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Zakir Hussain among various foreign dignitaries like Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the Delahousse family. =Old Famous Jalebi Wala= This jalebi shop in Old Delhi, aptly named, 'Old Famous Jalebi Wala', has been around since 1884; having been in operation for the past four generations of the family now. The jalebi shop was established by Late Sh. Lala Nem Chand Jain in the year 1884. He was a native of Agra's Hari Ki Garhi village. He migrated to Delhi with just INR 2 in his pocket that he got as a dowry in his marriage and opened a shop with that money. He experimented with many recipes before finally making and selling the jalebis that have such a fan following now. It is his secret recipe that is followed till date. This Chandni Chowk based shop is enormously famous for the piping hot, thick and juicy, freshly made jalebis that they offer. Their USP is that they use desi khandsari sugar for making the syrup instead of regular sugar, and the jalebis are prepared using desi ghee, cooked over coal-fire. The view of the jalebis being made is a visual delight as it is done live right in front in a small shop at the corner of Dariba Kalan Road. Economic structure Old Delhi has markets running through its streets. The area is vast and multiple products are being sold. Most of them are wholesale sellers and have been selling their products for many years. One such business is Gulab Singh Johrimal was established in Dariba Kalan in 1816 mainly as an attar (perfume) manufacturing business. Since then they have diversified into compounding, incense and toilet soap manufacture. Their retail outlet in Chandni Chowk was started later on. Another such shop is Harnarains manufacturers of pickles and preserves, located in Khari Baoli. Under operation since 1944, it is one of the older shops currently located in Old Delhi. Some migrants sell products like clothes, fruits etc. The sellers of one product often form an association to serve their interests and negotiate with the local government and other official bodies. The Old Delhi area and its markets are governed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).

The main feature of the park is a 90-foot (27-m) waterfall with a trail winding through Black Creek Gorge at its base past caves, an aboriginal fort, an abandoned dam, pioneer homestead, and Civil War carvings. The park also features a petting zoo, mini-golf course, the Gilliland-Reese Covered Bridge (built 1899) and a replica 1863 C. P. Huntington train ride. Noccalula Falls Park was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on May 12, 1976. It was rated in 2017 as the best campsite in Alabama in a 50-state survey conducted by Msn.com. The falls drop itself has been run successfully in whitewater kayaks on multiple occasions, beginning in late November 2011 when three expert kayakers ran the drop. The water level was unusually high, permitting a deep enough pool to form at the base of the falls. Local law enforcement, in defiance of federal law that grants access to navigable waterways, has since issued citations to paddlers for running the falls. The Noccalula Falls Botanical Gardens displays over 25,000 azaleas. History Most of the park is on land once owned by R. A. Mitchell, a former mayor of Gadsden, who bought 169 acres in 1909 and intended it to become a city park. His daughter Sadie Mitchell Elmore inherited it and offered it to the city for $50,000 in 1940; after an election approving the purchase, the city finally bought the land in 1946 for $70,000, and additional acreage in 1959. Improvements started in 1950. R. A. Mitchell Elementary School is located across the street from the falls. In the second half of the 19th century, the Gadsden Land and Improvement Company operated a tavern and dance hall in a cave behind the waterfall; attempting to increase the flat area inside using dynamite led to a cave-in. An inscription, \\"FAXON 1859\\", remains visible.  Statue and legend  Noccalula Falls at a lower ebb in July 1975 Above Noccalula Falls is a nine-foot-tall bronze statue of a young Cherokee woman, Noccalula, who, according to local legends, plunged to her death after being ordered by her father to marry a man she did not love. The legend is very similar to Wisconsin's Winona story as well as events from James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans. The statue is the work of Suzanne Silvercruys and was dedicated in September 1969; it was paid for by a fund-raising drive by the Gadsden Woman's Club that included school children collecting pennies. Although no peer-reviewed historic journals have evaluated the veracity of the legend, at least one independent researcher has published evidence suggesting that the story is apocryphal.

He claimed 18 air-to-air victories, eight fewer than \\"Ace of Aces\\" Eddie Rickenbacker and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Biography He was born William Carpenter Lambert in Ironton, Ohio. He was the son of Mary and William G. Lambert. Lambert had his first airplane flight in a Wright biplane on 4 July 1910. In 1914, Lambert quit his job as a chemist in Buffalo, New York, to go enlist in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. Finding no openings, he took a chemist's job with Canadian Explosives Limited until 1916. He joined the Royal Flying Corps in early 1917, and sailed for England after completion of his training, on 19 November 1917. He joined No. 24 Squadron RFC on 20 March 1918, flying the Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a, where his teacher was top scoring irish-born ace George McElroy. Between April and August, scored 18 victories-one observation balloon and 11 aircraft destroyed (with two victories shared), and six driven down out of control (one of which was a shared victory).Over the Front, p. 52. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Suffering from combat fatigue brought on by a bombing attack on his airfield, he was rotated back to England for medical leave on 20 August 1918 but the war ended before he recovered. One of his prized memorabilia was a piece of red canvas from von Richthofen's Fokker DR-1 triplane. After the war, Lambert did some barnstorming in the Ironton, Ohio area and worked as an engineer. He also was the inventor of a rather unusual \\"pipe rest\\" which allowed a smoking pipe to be rested upon the smoker's chin. Lambert joined the U.S. Air Service and served with the Army Air Forces in World War II. He retired in 1954 as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force. After World War, he was a frequent attendee at the RAF contingent's Battle of Britain celebration at Wright Patterson AF Base in Dayton, Ohio. Lambert's wartime experiences were related in his 1973 memoir Combat Report. He died in 1982 aged 87.

Komatsu (2001). In chemistry, melon is a compound of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen of still somewhat uncertain composition, consisting mostly of heptazine units linked and closed by amine groups and bridges (, , , etc.). It is a pale yellow solid, insoluble in most solvents. A careful 2001 study indicates the formula , that consists of ten imino-heptazine units connected into a linear chain by amino bridges; that is, . However, other researchers are still proposing different structures. Melon is the oldest known compound with the heptazine core, having been described in the early 19th century. It has been little studied until recently, when it has been recognized as a notable photocatalyst and as a possible precursor to carbon nitride. History In 1834 Liebig described the compounds that he named melamine, melam, and melon. The compound received little attention for a long time, due to its insolubility. In 1937 Linus Pauling showed by x-ray crystallography that the structure of melon and related compounds contained fused triazine rings. Structure of melon proposed by C. E. Redemann (1939). In 1939, C. E. Redemamm and other proposed a structure consisting of 2-amino- heptazine units connected by amine bridges through carbons 5 and 8. The structure was revised in 2001 by T.Komatsu who proposed a tautomeric structure. Preparation The compound can be extracted from the solid residue of the thermal decomposition of ammonium thiocyanate at 400 ¬∞C. (The thermal decomposition of solid melem, on the other hand, yields a graphite- like C-N material.) Structure and properties Structure of melon according to T. Komatsu (2001), showing two units. According to Komatsu, a characterized form of melon consists of oligomers that can be described as condensations of 10 units of melem tautomer with loss of ammonia . In this structure 2-imino- heptazine units are connected by amino bridges, from carbon 8 of one unit to nitrogen 4 of the next unit. X-ray diffraction data and other evidence indicate that the oligomer is planar, and he triangular heptazine cores have alternating orientations. The crystal structure of melon is orthorhombic, with estimated lattice constants a = 739.6 pm, b = 2092.4 pm and c= 1295.4 pm. =Polymerization and decomposition= Heated to 700 ¬∞C, melon converts to a polymer of high molecular weight, consisting of longer chains with the same motif. =Chlorination= Melon can be converted to 2,5,8-trichloroheptazine, a useful reagent for synthesis or heptazine derivatives. Applications =Photocatalysis= In 2009, Xinchen Wang and others observed that melon acts as a catalyst for the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen, or converting back into fuel, using energy from sunlight. It was the first metal- free photocatalyst, and it was seen to enjoy a number of advantages over previous compounds, including low cost of material, simple synthesis, negligible toxicity, exceptional chemical and thermal stability. The downside is its modest efficiency, which however seems amenable to improvement by doping or nanostructuring. =Carbon nitride precursor= Another wave of interest for melon happened in the 1990s, when theoretical computations suggested that Œ≤- ‚Äî a hypothetical carbon nitride compound structurally analogous to Œ≤- ‚Äîmight be harder than diamond. Melon seemed to be agood precursor for another form of the material, \\"graphitic\\" carbon nitride or g-. See also *Melem *Melam References J. Liebig (1834): Annalen Pharmacie, 10, 1.

Upon his death in 1993, he left a rich legacy that contributed to the cultural, social and economic life of Puerto Ricans in New York and Latinos everywhere. Early years Soto V√©lez was born in Lares, Puerto Rico a town known for \\"El Grito de Lares\\" of 1868, a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule. His parents died when he was seven years old and he went to live with his godfather who raised him. He received his primary education in Lares and later studied painting in the City of Arecibo under the guidance of Ildefonso Ruiz V√©lez. In 1918, he moved to San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico and lived with his sister. In San Juan, Soto V√©lez studied electrical engineering and business administration at the Ram√≠rez Commercial School. There he also met and befriended poets such as Alfredo Margenat (father of Hugo Margenat) and Pedro Carrasquillo. In 1928, Soto V√©lez worked as a journalist for the newspaper \\"El Tiempo\\", where he published many of his works. He was dismissed from \\"El Tiempo\\" after he wrote an article criticizing the injustices committed against the working class by the American-controlled sugar industry in Puerto Rico.Guide to the Clemente Soto V√©lez and Amanda V√©lez Papers 1924-1996 Atalayismo In 1928, Soto V√©lez together with Margenat, Carrasquillo and joined by poets Graciany Miranda Archilla and together with Fernando Gonz√°lez Alberti, Luis Hern√°ndez Aquino, Samuel Lugo, Juan Calder√≥n Escobar and Antonio Cruz Nieves founded the group \\"El Atalaya de los Dioses\\" which turned into the literary movement known as \\"Atalayismo.\\" [Costa, Marithelma and Alvin Joaqu√≠n Figueroa, 1990. Kaligrafiando: conversaciones con Clemente Soto V√©lez.] The \\"El Grupo Atalaya\\" movement sought to connect the poetic/literary world with political action and most of its members, including Soto V√©lez, became involved with the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Nationalist Clemente Soto V√©lez with Juan Antonio Corretjer and Pedro Albizu Campos (L to R) during their detention in 1936. Soto V√©lez became a militant member of the Nationalist Party which sought Puerto Rico's independence from U.S. colonial rule and served as Party organizer in the city of Caguas. Soto V√©lez also contributed to \\"El Nacionalista\\", the political news organ of the Nationalist Party. He took part in an attempt to take over the capital building in San Juan in 1932, and in 1934 was arrested and jailed for helping to instigate and participating in a sugar workers' strike. In 1935, four Nationalists were killed by the police under the command of Colonel E. Francis Riggs. The incident became known as the R√≠o Piedras massacre. The following year in 1936, two members of the Cadets of the Republic, the Nationalist youth organization, Hir√°m Rosado and El√≠as Beauchamp assassinated Colonel Riggs. They were arrested and executed, without a trial, at police headquarters in San Juan. On April 3, 1936, a Federal Grand Jury submitted accusations against Soto V√©lez, Pedro Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Vel√°zquez and the following members of the Cadets of the Republic: Erasmo Vel√°zquez, Julio H. Vel√°zquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were charged with sedition and other violations of Title 18 of the United States Code. Title 18 of the United States Code is the criminal and penal code of the federal government of the United States. It deals with federal crimes and criminal procedure.[*text of Title 18 Chapter 601 Immunity for witnesses, via findlaw.com] As evidence, the prosecution referred to the creation, organization and the activities of the cadets, which the government made reference to as the \\"Liberating Army of Puerto Rico\\". The government prosecutors stated that the military tactics which the Cadets were taught was for the sole purpose of overthrowing the Government of the U.S. A jury composed of seven Puerto Ricans and five Americans ended with a hung jury. Judge Robert A. Cooper called for a new jury, this time composed of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans, and a guilty verdict was reached.The Imprisonment of Men and Women Fighting Colonialism, 1930 - 1940 Retrieved December 9, 2009. Soto V√©lez was sentenced to seven years in prison which he served at the United States Federal Penitentiary at Atlanta, Georgia. In 1937, while in prison, his friends published his first book, Escalio, a philosophical essay.[Kanellos, Nicol√°s. 1989. Biographical Dictionary of Hispanic Literature in the United States: The Literature of Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and Other Hispanic Writers. CT: Greenwood.] In 1940, he was pardoned and returned to Puerto Rico only to be arrested once more for violating the conditions of his release. He was sent to prison at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania where he met Earl Browder, Secretary General of the Communist Party of the U.S.A. In 1942, after serving two years in prison, Soto V√©lez was released and not allowed to return to Puerto Rico. Activist Soto V√©lez went to live in New York City and in 1943, joined the Communist Party. He was involved with Vito Marcantonio's political campaigns and the American Labor Party. He worked for the Spanish Grocer's Association, Inc., and later founded Puerto Rican Merchants Association, Inc. which he directed through the 1970s. Among the cultural organizations which he founded were the \\"Club Cultural del Bronx\\" (Bronx Cultural Club) and Casa Borinquen. He also served as the president of the C√≠rculo de Escritores y Poetas Iberoamericanos (Circle of Ibero American Poets and Writers) and was a member of the Instituto de Puerto Rico en Nueva York (Puerto Rican Institute of New York). In 1950, he founded a magazine titled La Voz de Puerto Rico en Estados Unidos (The Voice of Puerto Rico in the United States).

While clock rates are a valid way of comparing the performance of different speeds of the same model and type of processor, other factors such as an amount of execution units, pipeline depth, cache hierarchy, branch prediction, and instruction sets can greatly affect the performance when considering different processors. For example, one processor may take two clock cycles to add two numbers and another clock cycle to multiply by a third number, whereas another processor may do the same calculation in two clock cycles. Comparisons between different types of processors are difficult because performance varies depending on the type of task. A benchmark is a more thorough way of measuring and comparing computer performance. The myth started around 1984 when comparing the Apple II with the IBM PC. The argument was that the PC was five times faster than the Apple II, as its Intel 8088 processor had a clock speed roughly 4.7 times the clock speed of the MOS Technology 6502 used in the Apple. However, what really matters is not how finely divided a machine's instructions are, but how long it takes to complete a given task. Consider the LDA # (Load Accumulator Immediate) instruction. On a 6502 that instruction requires two clock cycles, or 2 Œºs at 1 MHz. Although the 4.77 MHz 8088's clock cycles are shorter, the LDA # needs at leastThe 8088 has a loosely- coupled Execution Unit (EU) and Bus Interface Unit (BIU), with a prefetch queue; in the 8088, to execute the MOV AL,# instruction, similar in function to the LDA # instruction of the 6502, the EU requires 4 clock cycles, but the BIU requires 8 clock cycles. (It is a 2-byte instruction, and the BIU requires 4 clock cycles to read or write 1 byte, assuming no wait states.) Therefore, if the instruction is already in the prefetch queue, it takes 4 clock cycles to execute; if the instruction has not been prefetched, it takes 8 clock cycles; and if the BIU is in the process of prefetching the instruction when the EU begins to execute it, it takes 5 to 7 clock cycles. In contrast, the 6502, which has a much simpler fetch-execute pipeline, always takes the same number of clock cycles to execute a given instruction in any context. 4 of them, so it takes 4 / 4.77 MHz = 0.84 Œºs at least. So, at best, that instruction runs only a little more than 2 times as fast on the original IBM PC than on the Apple II. History =Background= The x86 CISC based CPU architecture which Intel introduced in 1978 was used as the standard for the DOS based IBM PC, and developments of it still continue to dominate the Microsoft Windows market. An IBM RISC based architecture was used for the PowerPC CPU which was released in 1992. In 1994 Apple Computer introduced Macintosh computers using these PowerPC CPUs. Initially this architecture met hopes for performance, and different ranges of PowerPC CPUs were developed, often delivering different performances at the same clock rate. Similarly, at this time the Intel 80486 was selling alongside the Pentium which delivered almost twice the performance of the 80486 at the same clock rate. =Rise of the myth= The myth arose because the clock rate was commonly taken as a simple measure of processor performance, and was promoted in advertising and by enthusiasts without taking into account other factors. The term came into use in the context of comparing PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computers with Intel-based PCs. Marketing based on the myth led to the clock rate being given higher priority than actual performance, and led to AMD introducing model numbers giving a notional clock rate based on comparative performance to overcome a perceived deficiency in their actual clock rate. =Modern adaptations of the myth= With the advent of multithreading and multicore processors, the myth has stirred up more misconceptions regarding the measurement of performance in multi-core processors. Some people without the proper knowledge believe that a quad-core processor running at 3 GHz would result in an overall performance of 12 GHz worth of CPU. Others may say that the overall performance is in fact 3 GHz, with each core running at 750 MHz. Both of these ideas are incorrect. Often the same user making these comparisons will be comparing multiple brands of CPU, which will not do the same amount of work per cycle in any case. While micro-architecture traits such as pipeline depth play the same role in performance, the design of parallel processing brings other factor into the picture: software efficiency. It is true that a poorly written program will run poorly on even a single- coresingle-core system, but even a well written program that was designed in a linear fashion, will often (if not always) perform better on a single-core system than a multi-core one when run by itself. A system's overall performance cannot be judged by simply comparing the amount of processor cores and clock rates, the software running on the system is also a major factor of observed speed. The myth of the importance of clock rate has confused many people as to how they judge the speed of a computer system. =Challenges to the myth= Comparisons between PowerPC and Pentium had become a staple of Apple presentations. At the New York City Macworld Expo Keynote on July 18, 2001, Steve Jobs described an 867 MHz G4 as completing a task in 45 seconds while a 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 took 82 seconds for the same task, saying that \\"the name that we've given it is the megahertz myth\\". He then introduced senior hardware VP Jon Rubinstein who gave a tutorial describing how shorter pipelines gave better performance at half the clock rate. The online cartoon Joy of Tech subsequently presented a series of cartoons inspired by Rubinstein's tutorial.  Intel reaches its own speed limit  From approximately 1995 to 2005, Intel advertised its Pentium mainstream processors primarily on the basis of clock speed alone, in comparison to competitor products such as from AMD. Press articles had predicted that computer processors may eventually run as fast as 10 to 20 gigahertz in the next several decades. This continued up until about 2005, when the Pentium Extreme Edition was reaching thermal dissipation limits running at speeds of nearly 4 gigahertz. The processor could not go faster without requiring complex changes to the cooling design, such as microfluidic cooling channels embedded within the chip itself to remove heat rapidly. This was followed by the introduction of the Core 2 desktop processor in 2006, which was a major change from previous Intel desktop processors, allowing nearly a 50% decrease in processor clock while retaining the same performance. Core 2 had its beginnings in the Pentium M mobile processor, where energy efficiency was more important than raw power, and initially offered power-saving options not available in the Pentium 4 and Pentium D.  Raising frequencies  In the succeeding years after the demise of the NetBurst microarchitecture and its 3+ GHz CPUs, microprocessor clock speeds kept slowly increasing after initially dropping by about 1 GHz. Several years' advances in manufacturing processes and power management (specifically, the ability to set clock speeds on a per-core basis) allowed for clock speeds as high or higher than the old NetBurst Pentium 4s and Pentium Ds but with much higher efficiency and performance. As of 2018, many Intel microprocessors are able to exceed a base clock speed of 4 GHz (Intel Core i7-7700K and i3-7350K have a base clock speed of 4.20 GHz, for example). In 2011, AMD was first able to break the 4 GHz barrier for x86 microprocessors with the debut of the initial Bulldozer based AMD FX CPUs. In June 2013, AMD released the FX-9590 which can reach speeds of up to 5.0 GHz, but similar issues with power usage and heat output have returned. Neither Intel nor AMD produced the first microprocessor across the industry to break the 4 GHz and 5 GHz barriers. The IBM z10 achieved 4.4 GHz in 2008, and the IBM z196 achieved 5.2 GHz in 2010, followed by the z12 achieving 5.5 GHz in Autumn 2012.

It stars Barbara Shelley, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Richard Pasco. Plot In 1900s Europe, Sascha Cass tells her fiance Bruno Heitz she's going to have his baby, so he leaves the house to tell her father. She goes after him, but loses him in the dark woods where she is petrified and turned to stone by something. At Vandorf Medical Institution, Inspector Kanof arrives to see Dr Namaroff to discuss the mysterious murder. Sascha's body is brought in and a calcified finger breaks off the hand as Carla Hoffman, Dr Namaroff's assistant, looks in horror. Police with dogs search the forest and find the body of Bruno hanging from a tree. At the coroner's inquest, Bruno is found guilty of Sascha's murder and his father, Professor Heitz, vows to clear his name. Afterwards, Carla chides Dr Namaroff for not telling the truth. Professor Heitz visits Namaroff and recounts the myth of the Gorgons, whose ugliness turns those who see them to stone. Heitz is later attacked by angry villagers and wires his other son, Paul, to come to Vandorf. Professor Heitz hears a female voice and goes outside. The full moon appears and he goes to the castle where he glimpses a green figure. He staggers back to the house and writes a letter to his son before he turns to stone. Paul arrives but is not allowed to see his father's body. Namaroff has attributed his death to heart failure but Paul does not believe him. Carla tells Paul that Megaera the Gorgon does exist. At the hospital, Carla tells Namaroff what she has learned about the Gorgon from Professor's Heitz' letter to Paul, which she read at his house. Ratoff, an orderly, comes in and reports that Martha, a mentally disturbed patient, has escaped again. Namaroff tells Carla that Megaera has taken on human form. Paul hears the haunting female voice and goes out into the courtyard where he sees the reflection of a horrible figure in the pool and collapses. He wakes up in a hospital bed; his hair has gone grey. When he's discharged, Paul tells Namaroff that he's staying in Vandorf to destroy the creature. As he leaves, Namaroff sees that Paul and Carla are holding hands. Paul digs up his father's grave and finds his body turned to stone. Carla appears and Paul offers to take her away but she refuses. Back at the house, Professor Meister, Paul's tutor, arrives. Namaroff performs an autopsy on Martha and removes her brain. Carla asks him if Martha is Megaera but he says no. Paul and Meister talk over events and deduce that Megaera must not be looked at directly. Inspector Kanof shows them details of all the women who have come to live in Vandorf; Carla is one of them. Carla demands to know why Namaroff spies on her. She arranges to meet Paul at Castle Borski the next morning. They meet and she agrees to come away with him but says it must be immediately. When he says he must find Megaera first, she says she will never see him again. Ratoff attacks Paul but Meister saves him. Meister finds a file on Carla which shows that she suffered from amnesia attacks during the full moon; he thinks she is Megaera but Paul refuses to believe it. They find Carla outside struggling with Ratoff. She tells Paul it's too late to go away. The door bell rings and Paul hides Carla. Namaroff and the police search the house but can't find her as Paul has sent her to catch the train to Leipzig. She never arrives. Meister locks Paul in his bedroom, but he climbs out of the window. The police return to arrest Paul for Carla's abduction. Meister escapes and follows Paul to the castle. There, Paul finds Namaroff, armed with a sword; they fight. Megaera appears, and Namaroff tries to behead her, but is petrified in the attempt. Paul looks at her, and as he collapses, Meister beheads her from behind. The severed head falls beside Paul and turns back into Carla. Meister tells Paul she is now free, and Paul dies.

Llewellyn Divine. Director John Gilling and producer Anthony Nelson Keys expanded on Divine's outline, developing it into a screenplay. For the role of the monster, former ballerina Prudence Hyman was recruited because the monster was supposed to float gracefully like a wraith. Release The Gorgon was distributed in the United Kingdom by Columbia Pictures/BLC Films on October 18, 1964 where it was supported by The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb. It was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on February 17, 1965 where it was also supported by The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb. The Gorgon was released in the U.S. on Blu- ray by Mill Creek Entertainment in March 2018 as a double feature along with the Hammer movie, The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll. The title of the film is misspelled as ‚ÄúThe Gorgan‚Äù on the spine. Reception Variety wrote, \\"Though written and directed on a leisurely note, 'The Gorgon' is a well-made, direct yarn that mainly gets its thrills through atmosphere. The period storyline is simple and predictable but John Gilling has turned out a well-rounded piece and Terence Fisher's direction is restrained enough to avoid any unintentional yocks.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin found that the monster's appearance was \\"belated, vague and insufficiently spectacular. Still, it makes a change from vampires, and though the film has little genuine flair for atmosphere it is quite well acted by Richard Pasco and an appropriately blank-eyed, statuesque Barbara Shelley.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6/10.

It lies about south from Kyiv on the Dnieper. Trypillia is the site of an ancient mega-settlement dating to 4300‚Äì4000 BCE belonging to the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture. Settlements of this culture were as large as 200 hectares. This proto-city is just one of 2440 Cucuteni- Trypillia settlements discovered so far in Moldova and Ukraine. 194 (8%) of these settlements had an area of more than 10 hectares between 5000‚Äì2700 BCE and more than 29 settlements had an area in the range 100‚Äì450 Hectares.http://www.trypillia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=104:videiko- m-yu-trypillia-culture-proto-cities-after-40-years-of- investigations&catid;=54:archaeology&Itemid;=66  History  Trypillian pots (Regional Archeological Museum) It was near Trypillia that archaeologist Vikentiy Khvoyka discovered an extensive Neolithic site of the Cucuteni- Trypillian culture, one of the major Neolithic-Chalcolithic cultures of Eastern Europe. Khvoika reported his findings in 1897 to the 11th Congress of Archaeologists, marking the official date of the discovery of this culture. The name \\"Trypillia\\" means \\"three fields\\" in the Slavic languages. It was first mentioned by Kyivan chroniclers in connection with the Battle of the Stugna River in 1093. During the 12th century, Trypillia was a fortress which defended approaches towards Kyiv from the steppe. One of its rulers was Mstislav Mstislavich. During the subsequent centuries, the town dwindled into insignificance. In 1919 it was the venue of the Trypillia Incident, in which Ukrainian forces under Danylo Terpylo massacred a unit of Bolsheviks.

Despite being innovative, the diminutive prototype proved tricky to handle and the project was canceled when the XP-77 did not deliver its projected performance. Design and development The Tri-4 (Company designations, later changed to D-6 Schrader 1999, p. 19.) project with the Bell Aircraft Corporation was initiated in October 1941. Originally a design study to meet the USAAF specifications for a \\"very light\\" interceptor, the XP-77 was intended to be a small, light fighter much in the mold of the 1930s Thompson Trophy air racers. On 16 May 1942, the USAAF recommended the construction and testing of 25 XP-77s. The aircraft featured a single-engine, low-wing monoplane with mainly wood construction, equipped with tricycle landing gear, a typical Bell feature that bestowed good ground handling. A bubble canopy also provided fair visibility except in the forward-downward direction due to the extended nose.Winchester 2005, p. 187. While originally conceived using an air-cooled 500 hp Ranger XV-770-9 12-cylinder engine with a supercharger, the prototypes were delivered with the non-supercharged XV-770-7 engine due to engine development delays. With the anticipated delivery time of the original engine delayed for one and a half years, Bell proposed that seven XP-77s be built using the seven XV-770-7 engines then available. The planned armament was one Hispano 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub (much like the larger caliber 37 mm moteur- canon of the SPAD S.XII) and two 0.5 inch Browning machine guns, with the option of either a 300 lb bomb or 325 lb depth charge with the deletion of the cannon armament. The mock-up inspection on 21‚Äì22 September 1942 produced some concerns from both the manufacturer and the USAAF inspection team. Weight had crept up beyond the 3,700 lb design limit but delays in the program were experienced when the company resorted to sub-contracting the wooden construction while the ongoing production at the Bell facilities did not allow for the XP-77 to take priority for research and development. Bell asked and received permission to reduce the production run of aircraft to two prototypes.Schrader 1999, p. 20. Operational history =Testing= The XP-77 project continued to suffer numerous delays, many related to correction of the excess weight issues. A change in subcontractor for the wing assembly also caused headaches as the first subcontractor refused to release necessary parts. Concerns over structural integrity relating to the glue and its binding properties were also difficult to resolve. With the anticipation that contract costs would soon be exceeded, and no hope that the supercharged engine would become available, the USAAF would only continue the project as an experiment to evaluate the use of wooden construction and materials in combat aircraft.Schrader 1999, p. 54. The first XP-77 flew 1 April 1944 at Wright Field but the flight tests revealed vibration problems due to directly mounting the engine to the airframe, without vibration isolation. The long nose and rear-mounted cockpit also inhibited visibility relative to operational aircraft of the time. The XP-77 proved to be difficult to fly and despite flying without guns or armor, it did not come up to the expected performance estimates mainly because it was woefully underpowered.Winchester 2005, p. 186. Further trials were conducted at the USAAF Proving Ground at Eglin Field with the second aircraft, which was destroyed on 2 October 1944 when it entered an inverted spin while attempting an Immelmann, and the pilot bailed out. All development was terminated in December 1944. Specifications (Bell XP-77) Bell XP-77 side view.

B. VII is an 8th-century Anglo-Saxon illuminated Gospel Book. It is closely related to the Lindisfarne Gospels, being either copied from it or from a common model. It is not as lavishly illuminated, and the decoration shows Merovingian influence. The manuscript contains the four Gospels in the Latin Vulgate translation, along with prefatory and explanatory matter. It was presented to Christ Church, Canterbury in the 920s by King Athelstan, who had recorded in a note in Old English (f.15v) that upon his accession to the throne in 925 he had freed one Eadelm and his family from slavery, the earliest recorded manumission in (post-Roman) England.Brown, 57, 87 The codex has 155 vellum folios and measures 11.25 by 8.5 inches. The folios are gathered into quires of eight leaves each, with a few exceptions. The ninth gathering has only seven leaves, but does not have a loss of text that would indicate a missing leaf. The fourteenth quire had ten leaves and the final quire has only four. The sixteenth gathering has lost one folio. All but the second, sixth, and seventh gatherings have the first word of the next gathering (a catchword) at the bottom of the final page. This was done to ensure that the gatherings were placed in the proper order. The text includes, in addition to the Gospels, the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus (known by its first two words Novum opus), the prologue to Jerome's commentary on the Book of Matthew, the letter of Eusebius of Caesarea to Carpianus (Ammonius quidam) in which Eusebius explains the use of his Canon Tables, prologues to each of the Gospels, tables of capitula for each of the Gospels, tables for each of the Gospels indicating the festivals at which portions of that Gospel should be read, and the Eusebian Canon tables. The manuscript was written in England, perhaps in a Northumbrian monastery connected to Lindisfarne or Monkwearmouth- Jarrow, though \\"the Frankish influence in the decoration and display script ... might equally suggest origins in Mercia\\".Brown, 52 The text is written in insular half-uncial in two columns. There are two or more hands found in the manuscript. Each chapter begins with a line of text written in red ink. There are markings for the Ammonian sections in the margins. The manuscript was copied either from the Lindisfarne Gospels, or from a common source. The text was originally almost identical to that of the Lindisfarne, however in this manuscript many readings, that are otherwise peculiar to Lindisfarne, have been erased and corrected. A significant variation from the Lindisfarne text is that after , this manuscript contains an addition which reads, in part, Vos autem queritis . . . erit tibi utilius. This addition is not found in the Lindisfarne Gospels, however it is found in an early 10th-century manuscript, also in the British Library (Royal, 1 A. XVIII). The tables of the capitula for the Gospels of Luke and John are identical to those in the Lindisfarne Gospels, as are the tables for the festival readings. These tables include festivals which were celebrated only in Naples (The Nativity of St. Januarius and the Dedication of the Basilica of Stephen). The source of the text for this manuscript and the Lindisfarne Gospels was probably a hypothetical \\"Neapolitan Gospelbook\\" brought to England by Adrian of Canterbury, a companion of Theodore of Tarsus who according to Bede had been abbot of Nisida, an (also hypothetical) monastery near Naples. Other books with the same textual character are the Stonyhurst Gospel and the St Petersburg Gospels.Brown, 52, 57 The illumination in the manuscript is limited to the Canon tables and four large initials. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as (the first verse after the Genealogy of Jesus), are begun with enlarged initials decorated in black, red, yellow and green in an early Anglo- Saxon style.

The lack of progress made in surveying Australia's territorial waters, most of which was unsurveyed or relying on Age of Sail-era charts prompted the Royal Australian Navy to seek a method of effectively surveying large areas from the air in the 1970s. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation developed the LADS system, with feasibility trials beginning 1977. The LADS system is built around a Nd:YAG laser, which emits an infra-red beam at 990 hertz. The beam is frequency doubled to produce a green laser. This is split into two beams, one infra-red, one green, by an optical coupler, with the infra-red beam aimed directly below the aircraft, and the green beam directed across the target area with a scanning mirror. The infra-red laser does not penetrate the water's surface, and its reflected pulse indicates the height of the aircraft above the surface. However, the green laser penetrates to the ocean floor, and the return pulse from the green laser indicates the height of the aircraft from the ocean floor; the difference between the two values is used to calculate the water's depth. The data from the lasers is not processed aboard the aircraft, but instead by a ground support team, with aircraft flight data and global positioning system information used to help generate hydrographic readings. The aircraft makes multiple, overlapping passes of the target area to ensure accurate data is collected. The LADS system is capable of taking 990 soundings per second, with data points positioned apart across a swath up to wide. The system is capable of working with waters up to deep, and can be modified to perform land surveys of areas with an altitude variance less than LADS entered service with the AHS in 1993. The equipment was initially fitted to a Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft. In 2010, the system was installed in a de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft. This is operated by the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight of the Royal Australian Navy.

Scarrow completed a master's degree at the University of East Anglia after working at the Inland Revenue, and then went into teaching as a lecturer, firstly at East Norfolk Sixth Form College, then at City College Norwich. He is best known for his Eagles of the Empire series of Roman military fiction set in the territories of the Roman Empire, covering the second invasion of Britain and the subsequent prolonged campaign undertaken by the rump of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. As of December 2019, there are 18 books in the series; the latest, \\"Traitors of Rome\\", was published in 2019. He has also written another series, Revolution, focusing on Wellington and Napoleon, whose first title, Young Bloods, was published in 2006. The second volume, The Generals, was released on 31 May 2007 and the third volume Fire and Sword was released in January 2009. The fourth and final novel of the series was released in Jun 2010 and is called The Fields of Death. He began publishing a new series in 2011 titled Gladiator. Books The last fifteen of Scarrow's novels have been Sunday Times bestsellers. His works have been translated into over twenty languages and have sold several million copies. He has been awarded two prizes for his fiction, a medal by NATO for supporting troops on deployment in Afghanistan and counts the King of Jordan as one of his fans. At present his Roman series has been optioned by a Hollywood studio to be produced as a TV series. Asked by the Edinburgh Book Review about the inspiration behind his interest in the Roman era, Scarrow said, \\"Firstly, great Latin teachers ‚Äì Gordon Rodway and then Reg Nash, who inspired a love of the language and more enduringly a fascination with Roman history and culture. Secondly, when I was growing up in the seventies swords and sandals epics seemed to be on the TV regularly. Not to mention the brilliant I, Claudius\\". Scarrow cites the inspiration for his 'earthy' characters as being from his time in the Officer Training Corps. =Eagles of the Empire series= The Eagles of the Empire series centres upon two main protagonists, Quintus Licinius Cato and Lucius Cornelius Macro, who are both Roman soldiers. Macro, a veteran with nearly 15 years' service (at the start of the first novel) in the Roman Army, has recently been appointed to the Centurionate. Cato is in his teen years, grew up in the Imperial Palace as a slave, and at the start of the series joins the Eagles as Macro's Optio. The first book starts in 42 AD. The books cover the experiences of the two soldiers, initially as experienced centurion and new optio, in battles in Germania and the invasion of Britain by Claudius as part of the Legio II Augusta. The 6th book The Eagle's Prophecy has them serving as part of the Imperial Navy east of Italy. The 7th and 8th put them in Rome's eastern provinces as agents of the Emperor's secretary Tiberius Claudius Narcissus. The 9th sees them shipwrecked on the island of Crete, fighting against a full-scale uprising. The 11th is set in Rome with the leads hoping to save the emperor from the shady Liberators. The Blood Crows is set once again in Britannia. The two protagonists are faced with defeating tribal rebels. The two characters Cato and Macro were additionally used in one book of the TimeRiders series: Gates of Rome. They served as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back to ancient Rome. Scarrow allowed his brother Alex to make use of the characters in his novel. In 2007 the publisher announced the intention to cease using the word \\"Eagle\\" in the title of books in this series, starting with Centurion. The change was apparently because the publisher wanted to attract more new readers to the series. #Under the Eagle (2000) #The Eagle's Conquest (2001) #When the Eagle Hunts (2002) #The Eagle and the Wolves (2003) #The Eagle's Prey (2004) #The Eagle's Prophecy (2005) #The Eagle in the Sand (2006) #Centurion (2007) #The Gladiator (2009) #The Legion (2010) #*Blood Debt (2009, short story) #Praetorian (2011) #The Blood Crows (2013) #Brothers in Blood (2014) #Britannia (2015) #Invictus (2016) #Day of the Caesars (2017) #The Blood of Rome (2018) #Traitors of Rome (2019) #The Emperor's Exile (WIP) =Revolution series= The Revolution Quartet centres upon the lives of Napoleon Bonaparte and Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington.

In the left cerebral hemisphere, it is one portion of Wernicke's area. The left hemisphere helps with generation and understanding of individual words. On the right side of the brain, it helps to discriminate pitch and sound intensity, both of which are necessary to perceive melody and prosody. Wernicke's area is active in processing language and consists of the left Brodmann area 22 and Brodmann area 40, the supramarginal gyrus. It is bounded rostrally by Brodmann area 38, medially by Brodmann area 42, ventrocaudally by Brodmann area 21, and dorsocaudally by Brodmann area 40, and Brodmann area 39. These cortical regions surround the lower left posterior Sylvian fissure.  History of Brodmann Area  Cytoarchitectonic labelling of Brodmann area in human brain The Brodmann areas originated in 1909 by scientist Korbinian Brodmann after publishing the first cytoarchitectonic map of a human brain. Cytoarchitecture is a method used to divide the cerebral cortex of the brain into Brodmann areas. The cytoarchitectonic map separated the cerebral cortex into 43 areas as a way to study and understand the structure of the human brain. Brodmann developed this idea of using a parcellation approach for areas of the brain by studying cell distribution in grey matter, structure of the cortical layers and neuron density. This idea was founded by examining the human brain compared to human and non-human primates. The human brain areas are labelled 1 through 52, however not all are shown on his illustration. Brodmann found gaps in specific areas that are not distinguishable in the human brain yet they appear in other species. Brodmann labelled these unseen areas as 12-16 and 48-51 on the human brain map. These numbers are used for examining the functional activity in the different areas of the brain. The Brodmann areas that are relevant to language include Broca's area (BA 44/45) and Wernicke's area (BA 42/22), where Broca's area is responsible for language production and Wernicke's area is responsible for language comprehension.  Language  Brodmann area 22 (BA 22) combined with Brodmann area 42 (BA 42) form Wernicke‚Äôs area in the superior temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe. Using cytoarchitectonics, BA 22 is located in the middle temporal gyrus which separates it from the primary and secondary auditory cortex. BA 22 is connected with nonverbal sound processing in the right hemisphere of the brain associated with activation in the auditory cortex. More functions associated with language in Brodmann area 22 include producing sentences, semantic processing, and processing of complex sounds. This area of the human brain supports lexical semantic processing and is responsible for language comprehension and production. Wernicke's area is shown to support lexical- semantics because lesions to this area result in difficulties displaying word selection during production of language. = Wernicke's Aphasia = Because Wernicke‚Äôs area supports language comprehension in the temporal lobe, lesions to the left auditory cortex, specifically in BA 22, results in Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia. Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia, also known as receptive aphasia, is a language disorder characterized as having difficulty comprehending language. This disorder varies in outcomes based on severity and localization of the brain damage, which is mostly commonly due to having a stroke. Patients diagnosed with Wernicke's aphasia are shown to have normal intonation and rate of speech, however have difficulty understanding different words of a language. Many individuals have poor awareness when making errors in speech, but are typically able to produce normal sentence structures when speaking. These sentences produced by patients with Wernicke's aphasia are often difficult for others to understand because of the problems with word selection and comprehension. These difficulties are shown at a lexical level, for example patients often struggle with naming figures due to accessing words from the lexicon.  Methodology  Methods used to understand functional activity in BA 22 consists mainly of Functional magnetic resonance imaging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique used to understand how language is processed in the BA 22. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique used to study volume of grey matter and white matter in Brodmann area 22 to find deficits in the structural volume. = Parcellations = Brodmann areas are based on cytoarchitectonic parcellation using numbering associated with locations in the brain to illustrate functional activity. BA 22 is separated from the primary and secondary auditory cortex by using cytoarchitectonic parcellation. Connectivity-based parcellations in BA 22 can be broken into three subparts: posterior, middle, and anterior subparts of the superior temporal gyrus. Using connectivity-based parcellations involves connections between white fibers to different areas in the brain. Cytoarchitectonic parecellations and connectivity-based parcellations are two ways of breaking the brain down to the structure and the connection fibers of Brodmann Area 22.

At the time of the murders, he was 26 years old and a deputy sheriff in Neshoba County, Mississippi. He was a member of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Although he was never charged with the murders, Price was convicted in October 1967 of violating the civil rights of the three victims. He was sentenced to a six-year prison term and served four and a half years at the Sandstone Federal Penitentiary in Minnesota. Following his release from prison he returned to Philadelphia, Mississippi, and worked a variety of jobs. Cecil Price died following a fall from a piece of equipment at his job on May 6, 2001. Murders On the afternoon of June 21, 1964, Price stopped a blue Ford station wagon on Mississippi Highway 19 for allegedly speeding inside the Philadelphia city limits. Inside the station wagon were three civil rights workers James Chaney, who was driving, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. Price arrested the three workers, allegedly on suspicion of having been involved in a church arson, and locked them in the county jail. During this time, he denied their requests for a phone call and instructed that anyone who called looking for them should be told that the three men were not there. Some time that same afternoon, Price reportedly met with fellow Klansmen to work out the details of the planned evening release and executions. Price released the three following Chaney's payment of the speeding fine and followed them in his patrol car. At 10:25, Price sped to catch up with the station wagon before it crossed the border into the relative safety of Lauderdale County. Price ordered the three out of their car and into his. He then drove them to a deserted area on Rock Cut Road while being followed by two cars filled with other Klansmen. He then turned them over to fellow Klansmen who committed the beating of Chaney and subsequent murder of the three men. Price returned to Philadelphia and resumed his duties as deputy while the bodies were being buried at an earthen dam that was under construction. Following a lead, the bodies of the three missing men were located at the dam site on August 4, 1964. Price was invited by FBI Inspector Sullivan to assist in the recovery efforts of the bodies. Sullivan suspected Price of being involved and wished to observe his reactions. FBI agent John Proctor stated that \\"Price picked up a shovel and dug right in, and gave no indication whatsoever that any of it bothered him.\\" Price helped escort the three bodies to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, where the autopsies were performed. Trial and aftermath Following the discovery of the bodies, the state of Mississippi refused to bring murder charges against anyone. In January 1965, however, Price and seventeen others were indicted with conspiring in a Ku Klux Klan plot to murder three young civil rights workers. The indictments were dismissed by District Court, but the decision was later reversed on appeal and the charges reinstated. The trial of Price and the other defendants began on October 7, 1967, as United States v. Cecil Price, et al. During this time, Price declared himself a candidate for sheriff and he lost the election to Hop Barnette, one of his co-defendants. On October 21, 1967, Price was found guilty at trial of conspiracy and sentenced by Judge Cox to a six-year prison term. He served four and a half years at the Sandstone Federal Penitentiary in Minnesota. Following his release in 1974, Price returned to Philadelphia where he worked as a surveyor and oil company driver, and as a watchmaker in a jewelry shop. He was never charged with the murders of the three men. Later in life, Price refused to speak publicly about the events of 1964 to 1967. During an interview for The New York Times Magazine in 1977, he stated that \\"he enjoyed watching the television show Roots\\". In the same article, Price said \\"We've got to accept this is the way things are going to be and that's it.\\" Price also told an African American pastor that he had repented of his previous actions. He helped Marcus Dupree, a friend of his son Cecil Jr., get a commercial driver's license, allowing Dupree to establish a career after his retirement from the National Football League. Price died on May 6, 2001, three days after falling from a lift in an equipment rental store in Philadelphia, Mississippi. He died in the same hospital in Jackson where, thirty-seven years earlier, he had helped transport the bodies of the three slain civil rights workers for autopsies. At the time of Price's death, Mississippi attorney general Mike Moore and Neshoba County prosecutor Ken Turner were considering bringing state murder charges against some of the surviving defendants in the 1967 federal trial. Attorney General Moore saw Price's death as harmful to the ongoing investigation: \\"If he had been a defendant, he would have been a principal defendant. If he had been a witness, he would have been our best witness. Either way, his death is a tragic blow to our case.\\" Portrayals in film and television right The first fictionalized version of Cecil Price appeared in the 1975 CBS 2-part TV drama, Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan. In this version, Ned Beatty portrayed Sayville Deputy Ollie Thompson. In the 1988 movie Mississippi Burning, the character of Deputy Clinton Pell is a fictionalized version of Cecil Price. The Pell character was portrayed by Brad Dourif with the part of Pell's wife played by Frances McDormand. In the 1990 TV movie Murder in Mississippi, Deputy Winter ‚Äì the third fictionalized version of Cecil Price ‚Äì was portrayed by Royce D. Applegate. In HBO's 2016 movie All the Way, Cecil Price was portrayed by Colby Sullivan. Archival footage of Price appears in the 30 for 30 documentary The Best that Never Was, which chronicles the life of National Football League player Marcus Dupree. The film begins with a brief mention of Price's involvement in the 1964 murders, then explains Price's role in assisting Dupree after his retirement from the NFL.

It is essentially a Nintendo 64 version of International Superstar Soccer Pro. Its team lineup follows more closely the Super NES version of International Superstar Soccer Deluxe, only with South Africa replacing Morocco. It is similar to the PlayStation version. International Superstar Soccer 64 was met with critical acclaim, and often called one of the best of the Nintendo 64's third party releases. Gameplay Germany-France match. The game is similar to the PlayStation version (including the same player names, with the exception of Japan, England and a handful of USA players), but with some teams having a more inaccurate home or away kit. USA, for example, uses their 1994 World Cup Adidas \\"stripes\\" kit as home kit and their then- current Nike home kit as away kit. Gameplay is similar to that of the Super NES predecessor, International Superstar Soccer Deluxe, upgraded for the Nintendo 64 with 3D animation. While it keeps largely the same team roster (with the teams now sporting near-authentic kits), South Africa debuted in this game as a selectable side, replacing Morocco. However, the Japanese version has teams that are not present in the Western versions; these being Bolivia, Yugoslavia, Iran, Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. There are six game modes, including single match, league battle, and penalty kick shootout. The player can assign a team member to cover a specific member of the opposing team. International Cup has the player competing against a range of teams from around the world in a round-robin tournament; World League is a series of 70 matches against every one of other teams in the game. The player can also contest a penalty shoot-out competition with up to 4 players, or attempt to complete certain scenario games. These games are set up with a specific goal‚Äîfor example, scoring a goal within a given time limit, or stopping the opposing team from scoring. Reception The game met with critical acclaim in Japan. In an interview around the time of the game's release in the region, Shigeru Miyamoto said that \\"Konami's soccer game may be better than [Nintendo's N64] games. It looks really good.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Japanese Nintendo 64 version, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that the game \\"goes farther than most titles in presenting a fantastic look and feel. Just make sure you have a few friends around to play it, otherwise you'll tire from 10-3 wins real quick.\\" U.S. reviews were also largely positive, and several critics noted that the A.I. in the North American release was dramatically improved from the Japanese version. Most said International Superstar Soccer 64 was better than the Nintendo 64's previous soccer game, FIFA 64, and Kraig Kujawa of Electronic Gaming Monthly went so far as to call it \\"without a doubt, the best soccer game on the market\\". GamePro was one of the few to voice criticisms with the game, specifically the music and the use of fictional players, but called it \\"an arcade-ish experience that, while not as realistic as FIFA, ranks much higher on the fun scale.\\" The most often cited strengths of the game included a variety of gameplay modes; the wide range of moves that the players can execute; the graceful, lifelike player animations; and the controls, particularly the tight responsiveness and strong implementation of the Nintendo 64 controller's analog joystick. However, most critics found it difficult to cover all of the game's positive elements. For example, Next Generation commented, \\"Details like refs of varying skill, different weather conditions, real stadiums, and attitude give even more depth to a game that gets just about everything right.\\" N64.com gave strong praise to International Superstar Soccer 64s multiplayer modes. They later published a longer review which covered a few criticisms, such as the lack of a FIFA license, but also commented more extensively on the game's strong attention to detail, and reemphasized that \\"As far as multiplayer games go, ISS64 has replaced Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64 and Wayne Gretzky as the ultimate gameplay experience.\\" Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot said that it \\"offers just about everything FIFA 64 did. It just does it slightly better.\\" Just a few months after the game's North American release, Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked it the 24th best console video game of all time, commenting that \\"The gameplay is awesome, appealing to both hardcore and casual fans of the sport. The graphics are the best of any sports game, as the attention to detail in the player animations is amazing. ... No soccer game comes close to this one.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it the 81st best game available on Nintendo platforms.

On November 19, Cooper learned from captured prisoners that part of Opothleyahola's band was erecting a fort at the Red Fork of the Arkansas River. Cooper's men arrived there around 4:00 p.m. Charging cavalry discovered that Opothleyahola's followers had recently abandoned their camp. The Confederates located and followed stragglers; the 4th Texas blundered into Opothleyahola's warriors on the tree line at the foot of the Round Mountains. The Federal response chased the Confederate cavalry back to Cooper's main force. Darkness prevented Cooper's counterattack until the main enemy force was within . After a short fight, Opothleyahola's men set fire to the prairie grass and retreated. The following morning, Cooper advanced on Opothleyahola's new camp but found that the Federal forces had fled. The Confederates claimed victory because Opothleyahola had left the area. The Confederates captured abandoned supplies, such as Opothleyahola's carriage, a dozen wagons, food, cattle and ponies. The Confederate loss in the engagement was 1 captain and 5 men killed, 3 severely and 1 slightly wounded, and 1 missing. Opothleyahola lost about 110 killed and wounded. This was the first of three encounters between Opothleyahola's Union bands and Confederate troops. The Unionists were forced to flee to Kansas after the Battle of Chustenahlah at the end of the year. Opothleyahola as a young man Battle site controversy The site of this event has been disputed for many years, with two locations emerging as the leading choices. One is near the present day town of Yale, Oklahoma. The other is close to the former site of Keystone (which is now submerged by the waters of Keystone Lake. Angie Debo, a noted Oklahoma historian, wrote an article describing the evidence for and against each site. She concluded that the evidence pointed more strongly to the Yale site.

The matches in the Scenario mode were heavily influenced by real matches with similar score. 1) vs 1-2 (Time remaining 1:14 - Italy's free kick) It seems like a defeat for ITALY against the talented CROATIA. ITALY scored a goal in the second half. Now they are trying to turn the tables around. This references to Italy's defeat against Croatia on November 16, 1994 during a Euro 96 qualifier played in Palermo. 2) vs 2-3 (Time remaining 1:02 - Germany's free kick) Although GERMANY had a 2 goals lead, the gave BULGARIA a penalty, and now they are behind by a goal.

On November 15, 1995 the match in Berlin ended 3-1. 3) vs 1-3 (Time remaining 1:54 - England's corner kick) It's ENGLAND, the home of football, against the champions, BRAZIL. ENGLAND can not end the game as it is, for the sake of their pride. This scenario references to England's loss to Brazil in the Umbro Cup. 4) vs 0-0 (Time remaining 0:56 - Germany's free kick) GERMANY cannot score a goal against ITALY, even though the ITALIANS are playing poorly. GERMANY wants to turn the tables with this free kick. This references to a 1-1 Draw in the Euro 1988. 5) vs 1-1 (Time remaining 0:49 - Sweden's throw in) TURKEY si doing extremely well against SWEDEN, who have been playing with their best team. One more goal for a historical win. This references to Turkey defeating the Swedes 2-1 in the Euro 96 qualifier. Match played on March 29, 1995. 6) vs 1-1 (Time remaining 0:42 - Belgium's free kick) In the last game when they faced each other, BELGIUM were sondly beaten. Although many key players are out, this time they want to make it even. This references to Belgium's tie versus Spain in a Euro 96 qualifier. Match played in Seville on March 29, 1995. On December 17, 1994 Spain won away for 1-4. 7) vs 0-1 (Time remaining 1:43 - Romania's free kick) ROMANIA is in good conditions. Even though they have let POLAND take the lead, there is plenty of time to turn it around. This references to the qualifier for the Euro 96 where Romania would go on to win 2-1. Match played on March 29, 1995. 8) vs 0-0 (Time remaining 1:24 - Scotland's goal kick) SCOTLAND is eager a ticket to ENGLAND for the finals. The most important thing to do is defeat RUSSIA right now. This references to a Euro 96 qualifier which ended 0-0. Match played in Moscow on March 29, 1995. On November 16, 1994 the match in Glasgow ended 1-1. 9) vs 0-1 (Time remaining 0:38 - Portugal's free kick) PORTUGAL have regained their old strong form. But they have just conceded an own goal. Concentrate and you may yet win. This references to Portugal's loss against Ireland in a qualifier for the Euro 96. Match played in Dublin on April 26, 1995. On November 15, 1995 the match in Lisbon ended 3-0. 10) vs 2-2 (Time remaining 0:49 - Argentina's corner kick) BRAZIL are strong. They seem like they can score from anywhere. But his is for the South American championship, so ARGENTINA must fight back. This references to many matches. The last one was the Quarter- Final in the 1995 Copa America, where Argentina would go on to lose 4-2 on penalties. Match played in Rivera on July 17, 1995. 11) vs 1-3 (Time remaining 1:38 - Holland's free kick) HOLLAND‚ÄôS defence has been shattered in the second half. Unless their offende starti something, the have no choice but to lose. This references to a Euro 96 qualifier were Holland lost the match 3-1. match played in Prague on April 26, 1995. On November 16, 1994 the match in Rotterdam ended 0-0. 12) vs 1-1 (Time remaining 0:02 - England's corner kick) Unbelievably, ENGLAND conceded a goal to a country from ASIA. It will be just a losing if the game ends in a tie. This references to a match of the Umbro Cup where England would go on to win 2-1. Reception Reviewing the Super NES version, Videohead of GamePro said International Superstar Soccer Deluxe, while not one of the best soccer games, is \\"respectable\\". He said the game has easy controls with a short learning curve, but that manual goalie control is difficult and high kicks tend to send the ball off-screen due to the large sprites and close-in side view. He praised the announcer's voice and crowd chants.

Critics were particularly pleased with the fluid, lifelike animations, the simplicity and responsiveness of the controls, and the strong blend of realism and fun. Kraig Kujawa of Electronic Gaming Monthly went so far as to say it \\"may be the best blend of realism and entertaining gameplay that I have ever witnessed in a soccer title.\\" However, the audio was strongly criticized, with the primary complaints being the inconsistency of the announcer and the annoying clicking sound which accompanies players moving down the field.

All-electronic, incorporating many circuit and control elements found in modern synthesizers, and using subtractive synthesis to generate tones, it was designed by John M. Hanert, Laurens Hammond and C. N. Williams, and was manufactured by the Hammond company. See also site's 'History' page Only 1,069 Novachords were built over a period from 1939 to 1942. It was one of very few electronic products released by Hammond that was not intended to emulate the sound of an organ. History of production While production of the Novachord began in November 1938, it was first heard at the 1939 New York World's Fair.Introduction to the Hammond Novachord The Novachord Orchestra of Ferde Grof√© performed daily at the Ford stand with four Novachords and a Hammond Organ. The first instrument was delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 30, 1940 as a birthday present. The Novachord was not well-suited to the technique of organists or pianists and required frequent adjustments to controls on the front panel to create new sounds. Like many analog synthesizers, it was much better-suited to producing \\"otherworldly\\" timbres. The instrument found its niche some years after production, shaping the sound of many science fiction film and television scores. Production stopped because of a shortage of parts in 1942 and poor sales kept it from being built after the war.120 Years of Electronic Music, The Hammond Novachord (1939) It is estimated that fewer than 200 Novachords are still in existence and considerably fewer are still in operation. The vast majority of surviving examples are in North America, although one is known to be in the United Kingdom. As of November 2017, there is now one in Australia. Technical details Containing 163 vacuum tubes and over 1,000 custom capacitors,Hammond Novachord. Many photos, outside and in. the Novachord weighed nearly 500 pounds and was roughly the size of two spinet pianos. The divide-down oscillator architecture, based on vacuum-tube monostable circuits, permitted all 72 notes to be played polyphonically by deriving several octaves of notes from twelve top-octave oscillators. A similar design was adopted in polysynthesizers released more than 30 years later by Robert Moog and ARP. Inside the Novachord The Novachord featured an early implementation of ADSR with seven attack/decay/sustain envelopes selectable by rotary switch and sustain-pedal controlled release. It also utilised a three-stage resonant band-pass filter network with variable damping and an electro-mechanical 6-channel vibrato unit operating on pairs of adjacent oscillators. The resulting sonic palette ranged from dense sustained string-like and vocal-like timbres to the sharp attack transients of a harpsichord or piano. Despite its historical importance, the Novachord did not enjoy commercial success. This was partly due to instability issues and the onset of World War II: reliability issues were caused in the main by the tight tolerances required of the operating parameters of hundreds of custom components. Hammond soon offered a special upgrade to improve stability, which was no more than a low- power heater bolted inside the enclosure to reduce the effects of humidity. The instrument was not known for vacuum tube failure perhaps because the heater voltage was reduced from the normal 6.3 volts to 5 volts. Appearances in contemporary media Like its contemporaries, the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot and the Trautonium, the Novachord can be heard occasionally in horror and science fiction film scores including many genre films from Universal Studios and James Bernard's ethereal music for Hammer's The Gorgon (1964). Jerry Goldsmith used the Novachord in several of his film scores and is known to have held the instrument in high regard. It was also used for the entr'acte music in Gone With the Wind (1939).Hammond Novachord Sightings.

Just like national teams, club teams consist of 22 players. The line-ups reflect the actual squads of the 1998/1999 season, as well as the uniforms. The 10 different stadiums included in ISS Pro Evolution are no longer generic stadiums named in letters order like in previous versions (although there is an imitation of the old Wembley Stadium in ISS Pro 98). The stadiums' fictional names stand for their real-life equivalents; for example, Stamford Bridge is named \\"Blue Bridge\\", while Old Trafford appears as \\"Trad Brick Stadium\\". Master League Barcelona and Torino One of the main new features of ISS Pro Evolution is a new game mode named the Master League. The Master League is an exclusive league consisting of 16 club teams included in the game reflecting the best European clubs of that time. Regardless which team you choose to play its squad will be replaced with generic squad consisting of fictional players. The idea of the Master League, beside winning the whole competition, is to complete a squad with real players on terms of transfers. The transfers are based on exchanging players for points you gain according to your match record, which is calculated accordingly to the results achieved - a victory equals 8 points and a draw gains 4 points. Bonus points depending on the goal difference at the end of the match are added to the total point score as well (the bonus is adjusted to the difficulty of the Master League thus goal difference on the hard difficulty level is multiplied by 2). Upon completion of the Master League, due to the lack of different divisions, clubs are not promoted or relegated, regardless of their finishing position. Instead, the Master League begins from the start, and all players acquired from transfers are kept in the player's squad, and the player can continue playing the Master League to eventually buy more players with their acquired points until the player has finally created their desired squad, since the Master League never actually finishes and always loops after all matches have been played. The player's squad can be exported outside of the Master League for use in other game modes such as the Training Mode and Exhibition matches. The Master League game mode is present in every subsequent version in the ISS and PES series. In successive versions of the series, throughout many modifications and improvements, the later versions of the Master League differ a lot from the original Master League used in ISS Pro Evolution, since the newer PES games are an emulation of a whole season with promotions and relegations being added due to new divisions, rather than having only one division.

The university offers first, second cycle and Doctorate academic degrees in a wide range of fields, in accordance with the Bologna process. It is now under the CMU/Portugal agreement with Carnegie Mellon University, having master programme in Computer Engineering, Human Computer Interaction and Entertainment Technology. Students admitted will be eligible for scholarships and have internship opportunity during the summer break. In addition, Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute, founded in January 2010, is devoted to building international partnership with other educational institutes and industry. History The university's campus dates back to a 16th-century Jesuit college. Its first higher education institution, a medical school, was founded in Funchal in the 18th century. In 1978, the University of Lisbon established a satellite campus in Madeira, and from 1983 to 1986, today's campus began taking shape, offering courses in the areas of science and technology, arts, humanities, and social sciences. In 1985, the campus integrated a polytechnic school of nursing (Escola Superior de Enfermagem); in 1989, a polytechnic school of education (Escola Superior de Educa√ß√£o da Madeira). In 1996, the Portuguese government and the University of Lisbon formally established the University of Madeira as an independent institution. In 2008, the university celebrated its 20-year anniversary. University of Madeira today Today, undergraduate and graduate students choose from a wide range of programs across several departments, including Art and Design, Biology, Medicine, Physical Education & Sports, English, German Studies, Romanic Studies, Physics, Management and Economics, Mathematics and Engineering, Psychology and Humanistic Studies, Chemistry, and a Nursing School. Specific programs include Art and Multimedia, Communication Culture and Organizations, and the Educational Sciences. Student life The Academic Association of UMa (AAUMA) provides an array of extracurricular activities for university students throughout the year. Past AAUMA sponsored events have included film screenings, Sports Gala, boating trips, and volunteer opportunities. In addition, representatives from each student association serve on the Advisory Council, affording students an active role in the growth of the university and its relationship with the surrounding community. Students who wish to explore Funchal will find a modern city of about 100,000 inhabitants. Its harbor and climate, combined with an attractive geographical position, have allowed Funchal to have a rapid population growth. The island is noted for its wine production, along with its exotic flowers, tropical fruits, and New Year's Eve celebrations with a spectacular fireworks show, considered the biggest in the world. Partnership with Carnegie Mellon In 2007, Madeira's Mathematics and Engineering Department, along with Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) established a dual-degree Master's in Human-Computer Interaction program. In the program, students study computer science, design, psychology, and social and decision sciences. Students enrolled in the partnership program study in Madeira and at Carnegie Mellon's Pittsburgh campus, earning master's degrees from both universities.

Dehon's focus in his ecclesial life was to express his closeness with workers but above all wished to foster and promote a devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It also became his mission to establish an order that would be dedicated to this task as well as to working in the foreign and diocesan missions in France and abroad. But impediments caused the order's dissolution though was later reformed and reestablished with Dehon assuming its leadership until his death. The process for his beatification started after his death but was halted in 2005 due to accusations that his published works were anti-Semitic in nature. He had been named as Venerable on 8 March 1997. Life =Education= L√©on-Gustave Dehon was born in La Capelle in Soissons on 14 March 1843 to Alexandre-Jules Dehon (1814-82) and Stephanie Vandelet. Dehon's mother fostered a deep devotion to the Sacred Heart and passed this devotion on to him. His baptism was celebrated on 24 March. He received his First Communion on 4 June 1854 and his Confirmation later on 1 June 1857. In 1855 he was sent to Hazebrouck to the college there where he studied under the noted priest Jacques Dehaene before graduating from the college in August 1859. In his adolescence he felt called to the priesthood (which manifested at Christmas 1865) but his father sent him instead for his education at the Sorbonne in Paris. He earned a degree in civil law on 2 April 1864 (with top honors) after his studies from 1860 to 1864 but had spent much of his free time in a local church. His father sent him on a long tour of the East (including Palestine) but en route back home entered the Saint Claire institute in Rome on 25 October 1865 to begin his ecclesial studies. Before he entered he met with Pope Pius IX who encouraged and blessed his vocation with Dehon referring to Pius IX as \\"goodness united with holiness\\". Dehon obtained a bachelor of sciences on 16 August 1860 prior to commencing his studies for the priesthood. Upon pursuing that path he began his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian and at the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare. It was there that he obtained a doctorate in philosophical studies on 27 June 1866 as well as in theological studies on 13 June 1871 and in canon law on 24 July 1871. =Priesthood= He received his ordination to the priesthood on 19 December 1868 in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran. His father came to terms with his son's vocation and returned to the Church himself after this. He celebrated his first Mass in Rome with his parents present. Dehon acted as stenographer at the First Vatican Council (he was one of four French priests acting as such; his record of the proceedings was published as the Diario del Concilio Vaticano I in 1962) and then served as a parish priest at Saint Quentin as a curate from 16 November 1871. He began feeling drawn to communal religious life and on 28 June 1878 - following a pilgrimage to Loreto in 1877 with the Bishop of Soissons Odon Thibaudier - founded the Oblates of the Sacred Heart in which he assumed the religious name \\"Jean of the Sacred Heart\\" upon the profession of his vows at the moment of founding; he had begun his novitiate on 31 July 1877 prior to founding. His new order grew at a rapid pace but misunderstandings about their mission attracted undue opposition which later compelled the order to disband on 3 December 1883 with Dehon feeling (in his words) \\"torn to shreds\\". But it was following a period of depression and serious reflection (as he undertook the Spiritual Exercises) that Dehon reformed the order as the Dehonians in March 1884 and making parish and foreign mission work as its focus. But it was the Bishop of Soissons Thibaudier who intervened to restore the order since he supported and appreciated Dehon's work. In 1886 he was elected as the order's Superior-General and held the position until his death. Dehon ensured that another focus of his order was to foster and promote a special devotion to Eucharistic adoration. The order received the decree of praise from Pope Leo XIII on 25 February 1888 who asked Dehon on 6 September in an audience to preach on the basis the pope's documents. The pope later appointed him in 1897 as a consulter to the Congregation of the Index and said of his decision: \\"Let it be known that I approve his positions as I entrust him to the function of one who must judge the doctrine of others\\". In 1889 he started a magazine called Reign of the Sacred Heart. Though the Dehonians had secured Leo XIII's support and his successors until Pope Pius XI he and his priests continued to be accused of slander and various other charges for a great period. These charges included accusations regarding Dehon's behaviour and his relations with the diocese overall. He participated in congresses and conferences and founded new houses but was noted for having heard confessions for long hours at a time. He began the construction of the Basilica del Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re in Rome (18.05.1920). Pius X had said of Dehon in 1906: \\"We are looking for saints. Here is one that is being born\\". Pius XI granted his order definitive papal approval in 1923. In 1906 the order's motherhouse relocated to Brussels after the Church-State separation in France in 1905 which caused great difficulties for religious congregations. He wrote numerous articles for newspapers and periodicals and published books on social matters and devotional topics. =Death= In December 1914 he drafted up his will and spiritual testament. In 1925 he began suffering from gastroenteritis that caused great pain to his digestive tract. Dehon died in Brussels on 12 August 1925 at 12:10pm; he died pointing at a portrait of the Sacred Heart and his last words were: \\"For Him I lived; for Him I die. He is my everything, my life, my death, and my eternity\\". Controversial publications Dehon became noted for being prolific in his writings. He often wrote for various newspapers and periodicals on a wide range of different social issues as well as devotional subjects such as the Sacred Heart. The latter became a predominant theme for several of his published works. But in 2005 serious allegations were made regarding Dehon's works in view of the approval of his beatification. The allegations specified that Dehon was anti-Semitic in which he expressed anti-Semitic views in his writings. This caused the suspension of his beatification until a reexamination of his writings could be undertaken with his findings released upon its closure. On 5 February one French historian drew attention to seven controversial texts in which Dehon was accused of being anti-Semitic. The French paper La Croix published extracts in which Dehon has said: * Jews were \\"thirsty for gold\\" * Jews' \\"lust for money is a racial instinct in them\\" * The Talmud is \\"a manual for the bandit, the corrupter, and social destroyer\\" Dehon's writings also suggested that the Jews wear special markings in which ghettos be established and Jews be excluded from land ownership and teaching positions. In his 1898 \\"Social Catechism\\" he said that Jewish people \\"favor enemies of the Church\\". Beatification process Dehon on his deathbed. The beatification process opened in the Mechelen-Brussels archdiocese in 1952 and had to collect witness testimonies and other evidence related to Dehon's work and life before the informative process could close. The cause remained inactive until 21 October 1988 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process and then received the Positio in 1990 for assessment. The theologians approved the cause on 30 January 1996 as did the C.C.S. members on 3 February 1997. Pope John Paul II titled Dehon as Venerable on 8 March 1997 after confirming that the late priest had lived a life of heroic virtue. Dehon's beatification depended upon a miracle being approved. These miracles are most often healings of a miraculous nature in which medicine and science fail to explain the healing itself. The case chosen came from S√£o Jo√£o del Rei and was investigated from 1961 until some point later while another process was opened and closed in the same location in 1965. The miracle in question involved the healing of the electrician Geraldo Machado da Silva from a grave case of peritonitis on 1 June 1954. The C.C.S. validated this process on 4 October 2002 and medical experts approved the healing as a miracle on 15 May 2003. Theologians approved it also on 21 November 2003 after confirming the miracle came after Dehon's intercession was invoked while the C.C.S. confirmed the findings of the two boards later on 20 January 2004. John Paul II confirmed the healing as a miracle on 19 April 2004 and confirmed that Dehon would be beatified. The current postulator for this cause is the Dehonite priest Jos√© Bri√±√≥n Dom√≠nguez. =Suspension= His beatification cause still pends. It had been scheduled for 24 April 2005 but had been postponed due to John Paul II's death just three weeks prior. But it was later announced that the beatification itself has been placed on hold due to a re-examination of his writings in response to charges of anti-Semitism which several individuals and organizations had levied - both clerical and secular. Serious doubts were raised in 2005 before John Paul II's death in which the Cardinal Archbishop of Paris Jean-Marie Lustiger sent an urgent letter to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who became Benedict XVI not long after) expressing alarm at Dehon's writings and asking for an examination. The French Episcopal Conference urged caution with the cause while the French government warned that it would not send a representative to the beatification if it went ahead. Benedict XVI therefore ordered an urgent reexamination of Dehon's writings with the first meeting scheduled for that 24 June. The pope tasked Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins in charge while also appointing Cardinals Paul Poupard and Roger Etchegaray. =Further developments= In a 5 June 2015 discourse to the Dehonians came comments from Pope Francis in which he expressed his desire for the cause to proceed while labelling their founder as \\"the almost beatified Dehon\\". The pope said that attitudes must be viewed in its historical context and said that he wanted the cause to \\"end well\\". Francis added that \\"it's a hermeneutic problem\\" that warranted an evaluation of the \\"hermeneutic of the time\\" rather than evaluating his writings through a more modern lens.

He represented England in 64 Test matches from 1909 to 1934. Woolley is generally regarded as one of cricket's greatest-ever all-rounders. His first-class career runs total is the second highest of all time, after Jack Hobbs, and he scored the seventh highest number of career centuries. His career total of wickets taken is the 27th highest. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1911 edition. In 2009, Woolley was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Early life and career development (1887‚Äì1906) Born and bred in Tonbridge, Woolley became interested in cricket at a very early age. His childhood home was his father's cycle and engineering shop at 72, High Street, which was only 100 yards from the Angel Ground, home of the local Tonbridge Cricket Club and an occasional venue for Kent County Cricket Club, most often for matches against Sussex. The house was later demolished for road widening, and replaced by what is now a Starbucks which has a blue plaque dedicated to Woolley on the wall facing Tonbridge's High Street. Like his Kent and England colleague Colin Blythe, Woolley is commemorated in Tonbridge Parish Church and has a road in North Tonbridge named after him. As a small boy, Frank would spend as much time as he could at the Angel. In 1897, when he was ten, the Angel became the base for the Tonbridge Nursery, a training centre for Kent's younger players until it closed in 1927. Woolley's natural ability as both batsman and bowler attracted attention and, in 1903, he was engaged to take part in morning practice sessions at the Angel and in occasional matches. In 1904, aged 17, he became a regular member of the Tonbridge ground staff and, in that season and 1905, he made rapid progress which soon earned him recognition as an all-round prospect of exceptional promise. He played for Kent's Second XI against Surrey Second XI at The Oval in June 1905 and, although Kent lost, he took seven for 28 in Surrey's first innings. Cricket career  In May 1906, Woolley made his first appearance at Lord's, playing for Kent Second XI alongside his brother Claud against Middlesex Second XI. The Middlesex team included Patsy Hendren and Ernie Vogler. Kent lost but Woolley made a good impression by taking five for 82 and four for 68. He made his first-class d√©but for Kent in 1906. Style and technique Writing for Barclay's World of Cricket, Harry Altham described Woolley as a \\"tall and graceful\\" figure who, with \\"a quiet air\\" was \\"unhurried in his movements\\". As a batsman, he had a gift for timing his shots and made full use of his long reach. He was especially strong in driving off his back foot against balls that other batsmen might consider good length deliveries. He was equally graceful as a bowler, making full use of his height to extract additional bounce from his deliveries. Altham pointed out that, although Woolley lacked the subtlety of Wilfred Rhodes, he was nevertheless a formidable bowler on any pitch whose conditions helped him. Woolley's long reach and his \\"large, prehensile hands\\" enabled him to take 1,018 catches, a total that remains a world record for non-wicketkeepers. Neville Cardus wrote that no other cricketer served \\"the meadow game\\" as happily and faithfully as Woolley. Later life and family Woolley with wife and daughter in 1929 After his retirement from cricket, Woolley was elected a life member of both Kent and Marylebone Cricket Clubs. He sat on the Kent club committee and remained active in his late life. In January 1971, he flew to Australia to watch the last two Tests of the 1970‚Äì71 series and saw England, under Ray Illingworth, regain the Ashes. In 1914 Woolley married Sybil Fordham, a daughter of an Ashford veterinary surgeon. The marriage lasted almost 50 years and produced a son and two daughters. After Sybil died in 1962, Woolley moved to Canada, where he married Martha Wilson Morse, an American widow.McCooey, Chris (3 August 2012) The Pride of Kent, Part 2: Frank Woolley 1887-1978. twtowncrier.co.uk References Category:1887 births Category:1978 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1890 to 1918 Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:English cricketers Category:Kent cricketers Category:London Counties cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Non-international England cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Over 30s v Under 30s cricketers Category:People from Tonbridge Category:Players cricketers Category:Players of the South cricketers Category:Royal Air Force cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:C.

He was one of the central figures of the pan-Slavist Illyrian Movement. Biography =Origin= He was born in Krapina (then in the Vara≈ædin County, Kingdom of Croatia, Austrian Empire), on August 8, 1809. His father Johann Gay was a German immigrant from Hungarian Slovakia, and his mother was Juliana ' Schmidt, the daughter of a German immigrant arriving in the 1770s.Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770‚Äì1945), Vol. 2, by Bal√°zs Trencs√©nyi and Michal Kopeƒçek The Gays were originally of Burgundian Huguenot origin. They arrived to Batizovce in present-day Slovakia in 16th or 17th century. Thence they became serfs of Mariassy de Markusfalva and Batizfalva families in 18th century. As there was a lot of ethnic Germans in that area, the Gays were soon Germanised. Ljudevit's father originates from a branch that moved to the village of Marku≈°ovce.Horvat, Josip. Politiƒçka povijest Hrvatske 1. August Cesarec, Zagreb, p. 49 =Orthography and other work= Concise Basis for a Croatian-Slavonic Orthography (1830) Gaj started publishing very early; his 36-page booklet on stately manors in his native district, written in his native German, appeared already in 1826 as Die Schl√∂sser bei Krapina. In Buda in 1830 Gaj's Latin alphabet was published Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskoga pravopisanja, poleg mudroljubneh, narodneh i prigospodarneh temeljov i zrokovKratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskoga pravopisa≈àa (\\"Concise Basis for a Croatian-Slavonic Orthography\\"), which was the first common Croatian orthography book (after the works of Ignjat ƒêurƒëeviƒá and Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá). The book was printed bilingually, in Croatian and German. The Croatians used the Latin alphabet, but some of the specific sounds were not uniformly represented. Gaj followed the example of Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá and the Czech orthography, using one letter of the Latin script for each sound in the language. He used diacritics and the digraphs lj and nj. The book helped Gaj achieve nationwide fame. In 1834 he succeeded where fifteen years before ƒêuro Matija ≈†porer had failed, i.e. obtaining an agreement from the royal government of the Habsburg Monarchy to publish a Croatian daily newspaper. He was known as an intellectual leader thereafter. On 6 January 1835, Novine Horvatske (\\"The Croatian News\\") appeared, and on 10 January the literary supplement Danicza horvatzka, slavonzka y dalmatinzka (\\"The Croatian, Slavonian, and Dalmatian Daystar\\"). The \\"Novine Horvatske\\" were printed in Kajkavian dialect until the end of that year, while \\"Danic[z]a\\" was printed in Shtokavian dialect along with Kajkavian. In early 1836 the publications' names were changed to Ilirske narodne novine (\\"The Illyrian People's News\\") and Danica ilirska (\\"The Illyrian Morning Star\\") respectively. This was because historians at the time hypothesised Illyrians had been Slavic and were the direct forefathers of the present-day South Slavs. In addition to his intellectual work, Gaj was also a poet. His most popular poem was \\"Jo≈° Hrvatska ni propala\\" (\\"Croatia is not in ruin yet\\"), which was written in 1833. =Death= Gaj died in Zagreb, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria- Hungary, in 1872 at the age of 62. Linguistic legacy The Latin alphabet used in the Serbo-Croatian language is credited to Gaj's Kratka osnova Hrvatskog pravopisa. Gaj followed the example of Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá and the Czech orthography, making one letter of the Latin script for each sound in the language. Following Vuk Karad≈æiƒá reform of Cyrillic in the early nineteenth century, Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s performed the same operation on Latinica ,using the Czech system and producing a one-to-one symbol correlation between Cyrillic and Latinica as apllied to the Serbian or Croatian parallel system. The Slovenian alphabet, introduced in the mid-1840s, is also a variation of Gaj's Latin alphabet, from which it differs by the lack of the letters ƒá and ƒë. Personal He married 26-year-old Paulina Krizmaniƒá, niece of an abbott, in 1842 at Marija Bistrica. They had five children: daughter Ljuboslava, and sons Velimir, Svetoslav, Milivoje, and Bogdan.\\"Krapinski Vjesnik\\". Godina VI. Broj 58. Studeni 2009.

The term was originally coined by analysts at Gartner, Inc.Gartner overview of BAM, Definition (PDF) and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a business process that is orchestrated by business process management (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management. Goals and benefits The goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed business decisions, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities. Key features One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on dashboards containing the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by event correlation to detect and warn of impending problems. Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by business intelligence (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary considerably. Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the issue tracking system. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated problem solving, where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes. Deployment effort In nearly all BAM deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors, for example banking, manufacturing, and stockbroking. Due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment, many enterprises use experts that specialize in BAM to implement solutions. BAM is now considered a critical component of Operational Intelligence (OI) solutions to deliver visibility into business operations. Multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. Wherever real-time insight has the greatest value, OI solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information. Processing events All BAM solutions process events. While most of the first BAM solutions were closely linked to BPM solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated, this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in BPM before being able to acquire and use BAM. The newer generation of BAM solutions are based on complex event processing (CEP) technology, and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events, therefore reducing the dependency on BPM, and providing BAM to a wider audience of customers. Examples A bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly. Another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.

Three types of structures are associated with the religious architecture of early Buddhism: monasteries (viharas), places to venerate relics (stupas), and shrines or prayer halls (chaityas, also called chaitya grihas), which later came to be called temples in some places. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of Gautama Buddha. The earliest surviving example of a stupa is in Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (prayer halls). These are exemplified by the complexes of the Ajanta Caves and the Ellora Caves (Maharashtra). The Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in Bihar is another well-known example. The pagoda is an evolution of the Indian stupas. . Early development in India The Great Stupa in Sanchi Gupta period temple at Sanchi besides the Apsidal hall with Maurya foundation A characteristic new development at Buddhist religious sites was the stupa. Stupas were originally more sculpture than building, essentially markers of some holy site or commemorating a holy man who lived there. Later forms are more elaborate and also in many cases refer back to the Mount Meru model. One of the earliest Buddhist sites still in existence is at Sanchi, India, and this is centred on a stupa said to have been built by King Ashoka (273‚Äì236 BCE). The original simple structure is encased in a later, more decorative one, and over two centuries the whole site was elaborated upon. The four cardinal points are marked by elaborate stone gateways. As with Buddhist art, architecture followed the spread of Buddhism throughout south and east Asia and it was the early Indian models that served as a first reference point, even though Buddhism virtually disappeared from India itself in the 10th century. Decoration of Buddhist sites became steadily more elaborate through the last two centuries BCE, with the introduction of tablets and friezes, including human figures, particularly on stupas. However, the Buddha was not represented in human form until the 1st century CE. Instead, aniconic symbols were used. This is treated in more detail in Buddhist art, Aniconic phase. It influenced the development of temples, which eventually became a backdrop for Buddha images in most cases. As Buddhism spread, Buddhist architecture diverged in style, reflecting the similar trends in Buddhist art. Building form was also influenced to some extent by the different forms of Buddhism in the northern countries, practising Mahayana Buddhism in the main and in the south where Theravada Buddhism prevailed. Regional Buddhist architecture =China= When Buddhism came to China, Buddhist architecture came along with it. There were many monasteries built, equaling about 45,000. These monasteries were filled with examples of Buddhist architecture, and because of this, they hold a very prominent place in Chinese architecture. One of the earliest surviving example is the brick pagoda at the Songyue Monastery in Dengfeng County. =Indonesia= Borobudur, the largest Buddhist temple in the world. Buddhism and Hinduism reach Indonesian archipelago in early first millennia. The oldest surviving temple structure in Java is Batujaya temples in Karawang, West Java, dated as early as 5th century. The temple was a Buddhist sites, as evidence of the discovered Buddhist votive tablets, and the brick stupa structure. The apogee of ancient Indonesian Buddhist art and architecture was the era of Javanese Shailendra dynasty that ruled the Mataram Kingdom in Central Java circa 8th to 9th century CE. The most remarkable example is the 9th century Borobudur, a massive stupa that took form of an elaborate stepped pyramid that took plan of stone mandala. The walls and balustrades are decorated with exquisite bas reliefs, covering a total surface area of 2,500 square metres. Around the circular platforms are 72 openwork stupas, each containing a statue of the Buddha. Borobudur is recognised as the largest Buddhist temple in the world. =Hawaii= A lot of the Buddhist temples in Hawaii have an architecture that is very specific to the islands. This comes from the fact that the Japanese immigrants who migrated to Hawaii didn't have all the materials they would in Japan, and also the land structure was different and called for different building techniques. Because these Japanese immigrants had all the knowledge of Buddhism and were exceptional craftsmen, these temples ended up being a good personification of their religion. There are 5 styles of architecture that can be found in the Buddhist temples of Hawaii. The styles vary because of the time periods they were used in.‚ÄúArchitecture and Interiors.‚Äù Japanese Buddhist Temples in Hawai‚Äòi: An Illustrated Guide, by George J. Tanabe and Wills Jane Tanabe, University of Hawai'i Press, 2013, pp. 17‚Äì42. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqfvf.6. Converted houses  This was the earliest form of Buddhist temples in Hawaii. They took a larger plantation house and converted them into places of worship by adding things like an altar or shrines. This style offered an inexpensive way to build temples, and using residential space made the worshipers feel more connected. The most noteworthy difference is that the homes were not built with the intention of being turned into temples, they were originally built as a place for families to live. This style dropped in popularity during the 20th century. Traditional Japanese  This style originated when Japanese immigrants with the existing skill of building temples and shrines moved to Hawaii. These were made to be as similar to the original Japanese temples, but certain aspects had to be changed because of lesser access to materials and tools. Notable characteristics of this style are beam and post structure, elevated floors, and hip-and-gable roofs. The interiors held the same structure as its original counterparts in Japan. Simplified Japanese  This style originated with Japanese immigrants who did not have the greatest shrine and temple building skills. These immigrants still wanted the temples to have their original feel, but lack the skill to do it, so the building techniques they used were simplified. Some characteristics of this style are straight hip-and-gable roofs, as opposed to the long, sloping ones, separate social hall, and covered entryway. These temples doubled as community centers, and these temples were similar in style to western churches. Indian Western  This style only is unique to Hawaii and came about due to racial and religious movements. This religious movement referred to Pan-Asian Buddhism, which was a combination of Indian, Japanese, and Western Buddhism. When the first temple of this style was built, the architects that were hired had no previous experience in Buddhist architecture. This style was popular up until the 1960s. This was probably one of the most popular styles of Buddhist architecture in Hawaii; smaller temples that couldn't afford to hire architects to do this to their temple would take certain aspects of this style and apply it to their temple. The interiors of these temples are very similar to the original temples in Japan. House of worship  This style is also very similar to western churches. This style became popular in the 1960s. These temples are usually made of concrete, and the roof styles vary unlike the other styles of temples. The subcategories of this style are residential, warehouse, church, and Japanesque. Like the other styles, while the exterior is dramatically different, the interior mostly remained similar to the temples in Japan.

It was directed by Amy Heckerling; its four screenwriters included Bernie Kukoff and Jeff Harris. The film stars Michael Keaton as an honest, goodhearted man who is forced to turn to a life of crime to finance his mother's skyrocketing medical bills and to put his younger brother through law school. It also features Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Peter Boyle, Griffin Dunne, Dom DeLuise, Danny DeVito, Dick Butkus and Alan Hale, Jr. Part of the film's comedic appeal is the clever and frequent use of malapropisms by Johnny and other crime characters, especially in instances where curse words were intended; all of which suggests a successful life in crime does not necessarily require a competent command of the English language. Plot 1935\\\\. A pet shop owner catches a young boy shoplifting a puppy. To discourage the kid from a life of crime, the owner tells a story. 1910\\\\. Young Johnny Kelly is a poor but honest newsboy in New York City. Johnny's mother, Ma Kelly, needs an operation they cannot afford. Since the execution of Johnny's father, Killer Kelly, Ma Kelly has supported Johnny and his younger brother, Tommy, who is fascinated by the law. Johnny's fight with a local kid (Danny Vermin) attracted the notice of local crime boss Jocko Dundee, who offers Johnny a job. Seeing no honest way to earn the money for his mother's operation, Johnny agrees to work for Dundee, even though it probably means \\"breaking his mother's heart.\\" He helps rob the nightclub belonging to Dundee's rival, Roman Moronie. When asked his name, Johnny coins \\"Johnny Dangerously\\", but Moronie, a malapropist of swearwords, claims he \\"never forgets a fargin' face.\\" Years pass. With Ma's continuing medical problems, Johnny goes to work for Dundee full-time. The whole neighborhood (including the Pope) knows that Kelly is really Johnny Dangerously, except for Ma and Tommy, who think he is a nightclub owner. Similarly, the gang knows nothing of Johnny's mother and brother. Johnny comes to Dundee's headquarters to find he has taken on two new gang members: Danny Vermin and his sidekick Dutch. Danny has lived up to his potential and become a total scumbag, with a taste for using opera audiences as shooting galleries with his .88 Magnum pistol (according to Dutch, \\"They made it for him special.\\" Danny then adds, \\"It shoots through schools!\\"). As the two gangs continue to war, Johnny falls for Lil Sheridan, a young showgirl new to the big city. (\\"Do you know your last name is an adverb?\\" she asks.) Eventually, Johnny becomes the boss of the Dundee gang and negotiates a truce with Moronie. A running gag has Ray Walston playing the owner of a newsstand who is repeatedly knocked out by a pile of newspapers flung from a delivery truck. He temporarily loses one of his primary senses whenever he comes to. At various points throughout the movie, his character alternates between blindness, deafness, and amnesia. Eventually, Tommy graduates from law school (funded by Johnny's illicit earnings), and he goes to work for the District Attorney's office, under D.A. Burr, who is on Johnny's payroll. D.A. Burr tries to sidetrack Tommy, who has become a major public figure after hearings looking into Moronie's activities. (The rival crime boss is deported to Sweden, though he protests that he's \\"not from there.\\") Meanwhile, Burr and Vermin conspire to kill Tommy. Tommy is badly injured but survives. Johnny has Burr killed, but this leaves Tommy as the new D.A. Vermin discovers that Dangerously is the D.A.'s brother--and Tommy overhears Vermin chortling about it. Tommy confronts Johnny, who agrees to turn over the evidence against himself to the Crime Commissioner--whom Vermin killed, framing Johnny. Not only that, Vermin steals Johnny's prized cigarette/gum case! Johnny is arrested but says the holder of the case is the guilty party. Johnny is found guilty, sentenced to the electric chair and sent to death row. But when Vermin congratulates Tommy, Tommy notices that he has Johnny's case. Ma Kelly sucker punches Vermin in the crotch, and they realize that \\"Johnny didn't do it.\\" Johnny arrives on Death Row, where he receives rock star treatment from the starstruck warden. Johnny hears word that Tommy is in danger, and plots an escape, prevailing on the warden to move up his execution. As he is taken to the chair, Johnny assembles what looks like a tommy gun from parts handed to him by inmates. He escapes in a laundry truck driven by Lil. Johnny, by way of a wild car chase involving several layers of shelf paper, arrives at the movie theatre where Tommy is to be killed. He shoots and wounds Vermin, saving Tommy. The governor pardons Johnny as Vermin is arrested. Back to 1935. The young shoplifter is round eyed. He is given a kitten as Johnny says \\"Don't forget, crime doesn't pay.\\" The kid goes on his way. Johnny, dressed in a tux, heads off in a limo with Lil, looks at the camera and admits, \\"Well, it paid a little!\\" Cast * Michael Keaton as Johnny Kelly (a.k.a.

Hurd, the film \\"is loaded with sight gags, one liners, numerous sexual jokes, and puns\\". But many critics found it to be a comedy which relies on sophomoric humor.Hurd (2007), p. 24 According to Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, the film is both a gangster comedy and an homage to 1930s gangster films, but is perhaps too clever for a mainstream audience.Foster (1995), p. 175 According to Leigh Hallisey, the film is a parody of \\"old-school\\" gangster films and reveals Heckerling's awareness of their conventions and stereotypes.Hallisey (2002), p. 232 Foster finds the comedies of Amy Heckerling to rely on \\"fast- paced, witty repartee and droll humor\\", and draws comparisons to those of Frank Tashlin and Jerry Lewis.Foster (1995), p. 175 Martin F. Norden considers the film to be part of a trend in 1980s comedies, linking disability to humor. He notes that the film contains numerous gags of this nature. He spotlights a running gag, concerning a blind newspaper vendor played by Ray Walston. He starts out blind but a bundle of newspapers hits him on the head, causing him to regain his sight. A repetition of the accident then leaves him deaf. Another repetition restores his sight and hearing but causes him to suffer amnesia.Norden (1994), p. 290 References ;Bibliography  * External links  Category:1984 films Category:1980s crime comedy films Category:American films Category:American crime comedy films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Amy Heckerling Category:Films scored by John Morris Category:Films set in 1910 Category:Films set in 1935 Category:Films set in New York City Category:Mafia comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:1984 comedy films ","title":"Johnny Dangerously"},{"id":"2093434","text":"Scott Christopher Proctor (born January 2, 1977) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 2004 and 2011 for the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Atlanta Braves. In 2012, he played for the Doosan Bears of the KBO League. Baseball career =Amateur career= Proctor was drafted in the 17th round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets out of Martin County High School, but decided to attend Florida State University, where he played for the Florida State Seminoles baseball team under head coach Mike Martin. He was 10‚Äì2 in 60 career games for Florida State. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 1997 and 1998 to play with the Hyannis Mets. =Minor leagues= In 1998, Proctor was drafted in the fifth round by the Los Angeles Dodgers and assigned to the Yakima Bears to start his professional career. He played for the Vero Beach Dodgers (2000‚Äì2001), Jacksonville Suns (2001‚Äì2003) and Las Vegas 51s (2003). =New York Yankees= On July 31, 2003, Proctor was traded to the New York Yankees with Bubba Crosby for Robin Ventura. The Yankees assigned him to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers. Proctor made his Major League Baseball debut for the Yankees on April 20, 2004 against the Chicago White Sox, working innings in relief and allowing 2 earned runs. Throughout the course of his first season, he appeared in 26 games, pitched 25 innings, finished 12 games, and posted a 2‚Äì1 record and a 5.40 ERA with 21 strikeouts. He finished the 2005 season with a 6.04 ERA and a 1‚Äì0 record. In 2006, Proctor emerged as a durable, reliable late-inning option for manager Joe Torre. Finally harnessing his breaking pitches, Proctor led the American League with 83 appearances, often pitching more than one inning or in consecutive games. Proctor notched his first career save in 2006. Along with Kyle Farnsworth and Brian Bruney, Proctor was a part of the Yankees' bridge between the starters and closer Mariano Rivera, and reprised that role for the first part of the 2007 season. Proctor's heavy use as a Yankee reliever led to concerns that Torre was overusing him. General manager Brian Cashman revealed in 2011 that he confronted Torre about Proctor's workload and asked the pitcher to be more honest about whether he could pitch on a given day: \\"I met with Proctor and said, 'You better stop telling the manager [that you can pitch] because the way he manages' -- I'm not criticizing Joe, that's just the way he is -- 'He wants an honest answer. Just tell him no. Proctor pitched in 5 postseason games for the Yankees: two against Los Angeles and three against Detroit. In six innings, he struck out two and gave up just one run. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Proctor with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008 On July 31, 2007, Proctor was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for infielder Wilson Betemit. He was mostly used as a late inning setup man. He finished the 2007 season with an impressive 3‚Äì0 record and a 3.38 ERA in 31 relief appearances for the Dodgers. He had a rough 2008 season and spent most of it on the Disabled List. However, he pitched much better in the month of September, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers win the National League West Division title. He finished the season with a 2‚Äì0 record, but a high ERA of 6.05 in just 41 games. He became a free agent at the end of the season. =Florida Marlins= In January 2009, he signed a one-year contract with the Florida Marlins worth $750,000, with an additional $250,000 in incentives. During Spring training, he was placed on the disabled list with elbow pain. When the pain remained, and ligament fraying was found, he underwent Tommy John surgery on May 12, 2009, and missed the entire 2009 season. On October 9, 2009, Proctor was released by the Marlins. =Atlanta Braves= On November 4, 2009 Proctor's agent, Mark Rodgers, released that Proctor had signed a split contract with the Braves and received an invitation to Spring training. He spent 2010 pitching for the Double-A Mississippi Braves and Triple-A Gwinnett Braves. As of August 14, he had compiled a 7.82 ERA in 31 appearances between the 2 teams. On March 27, 2011 after pitching with a 5.06 ERA in ten appearances in the 2011 Atlanta Braves Spring training camp, Proctor was released from the Braves' organization. Had he remained on the Braves' roster the following day, his $750,000 salary would have been paid in full. Instead, the Braves merely had to pay him a fraction of his salary. Just over a week after being released from the Braves organization, Proctor re-signed to the Braves on April 3, 2011, with a minor league contract. He has been added to the roster of their Triple-A affiliate, the Gwinnett Braves. He had his contract purchased on May 14. Proctor was released from the Braves on August 10, 2011 after posting a 6.44 ERA in 31 appearances. His roster spot was filled by Arodys Vizca√≠no. In two seasons with Atlanta, Proctor, with a record of 2‚Äì3, had a 6.43 ERA in 37 appearances, allowing 35 hits, 5 Home runs, 25 earned runs and 23 walks with 24 strikeouts in 35 innings. =Return to the Yankees= On August 13, he signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees and was assigned to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. He was called up on September 1 and made his debut for the Yankees on September 5, entering in relief against the Baltimore Orioles. Proctor picked up the loss in Game 162, surrendering a walkoff homerun to Evan Longoria that propelled the Rays to the postseason. He declared for free agency on October 11. =Doosan Bears= Proctor signed with the Doosan Bears of the Korea Baseball Organization for the 2012 season.http://news.naver.com/sports/index.nhn?category=baseball&ctg;=news&mod;=read&office;_id=109&article;_id=0002294953 =San Francisco Giants= Proctor signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants on January 2, 2013. =Baltimore Orioles= Proctor was traded to the Orioles on March 29, 2013 for cash considerations. Pitching Proctor is a power pitcher with a diverse pitch repertoire. Proctor's fastball ranges from 94 mph to almost 100, although he was known to throw beyond 100 as the closer for the Columbus Clippers, the Yankees' former Triple-A affiliate. As a former minor league starter, Proctor features several pitches. He will throw both four and two-seam fastballs. Proctor's secondary pitches include a mid-eighties slider, a high seventies curveball, and an occasional changeup in the low eighties. He will throw all but his change-up in any count, but his primary weapons are the four-seam fastball, the curve, and the slider. Controversies Proctor has run into some instances where he has appeared to assume the responsibility of retaliation for the Yankees. In two instances, Proctor allegedly threw at batters with the intention for retaliation. One instance occurred in a game against the Seattle Mariners in which Scott Proctor threw behind Yuniesky Betancourt. Betancourt and Proctor exchanged heated words. Proctor may have felt that the Yankees were in position to retaliate after his teammate, Yankees first baseman Josh Phelps, was hit by a pitch. But Phelps was hit in retaliation for his part in, what appeared to be, an intentional hit on Seattle catcher Kenji Johjima. Therefore, the incident between Phelps and Johjima has already been settled with the \\"beaning\\" of Phelps but Proctor took offense to the fact the retaliation was exercised on Phelps. Proctor was suspended after that incident. Another instance occurred on June 1, 2007 when Proctor hit Boston Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis in the shoulder after two Yankee batters were hit. Youkilis was the fifth hit batsman in the game. A visibly enraged Youkilis had to be held back by Yankee catcher Jorge Posada. Proctor was soon ejected after both benches calmed, though Proctor remained upset over his ejection. After the game, he protested to the media that the pitch had gotten away from him and that he had no reason to hit Youkilis as he had a 2‚Äì2 count. Before the following game, during the YES Pre-Game Show, Joe Torre told reporters that after Proctor's ejection, Proctor stormed into Torre's office and insisted that he did not throw at Youkilis intentionally, an explanation Torre accepted. Torre, however, did not protest Proctor's resulting one-game suspension. On June 30, after a poor performance in a loss to the Oakland Athletics (and after taking the loss in each of the Yankees' last two games), Proctor lit fire to his equipment on the field, just feet from the Yankees dugout. In June 2009, Proctor revealed that he was a recovering alcoholic and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He credits Mariano Rivera with urging him to straighten his life out. =Heavy use= The heavy usage of Scott Proctor early in his career has drawn criticism of the way then Yankee manager Joe Torre used relievers. Proctor appeared in 83 games in both 2006 and 2007, 3rd and 5th most amongst all MLB pitchers respectively. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman says he told Proctor to give an \\"honest answer\\" to manager Joe Torre when he asked if Proctor was ready to pitch again.

Summary Egyptian artifacts intended for the Braintree Museum in Washington, D.C. are stolen. Mysterious figures from ancient Egypt are sighted at night, people are murdered, a mummy speaks and walks, people have terrible headaches and seem to be taken over by their pre-incarnations as ancient Egyptians.

Nellie Gray is prominent on the list of intended sacrifices, and Smitty, rescuing her at one point, Samson-like, pulls down a reproduction Egyptian temple in the museum. Josh guards the Egyptian exhibit at night after a guard is killed and another quits; realistically nervous, he displays none of the typical feet-shuffling eye-rolling mannerisms often found in the pulps of this time.

NLU enrolls undergraduate and graduate students in more than 60 programs across its four colleges. It has locations throughout the Chicagoland area as well as a regional campus in Tampa Bay, Florida, where it serves students from 13 counties in that state‚Äôs central region. Since its founding in 1886, NLU has played a historic role in the education sector. Its founders helped start the National Kindergarten Movement, helped inaugurate the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and promoted the importance of academic and professional training in early childhood education theory and practice. NLU has received more than $65 million in funding for applied research projects in urban development, childhood development, school improvement and teacher preparation. Its alumni have served in Illinois state government and received multiple James Beard awards; 76 alumni from its National College of Education have received honorary recognition by the Golden Apple Foundations of Chicago and Rockford.  History  National Louis University (NLU) began in 1886, when Elizabeth Harrison founded the school to train \\"Kindergarteners\\", young women teachers who began the early childhood education movement. The school's requirements became a model for education colleges nationwide. In 1893, the university published Harrison's book, The Kindergarten as an Influence in Modern Civilization, in which she explained, \\"how to teach the child from the beginning of his existence that all things are connected [and] how to lead him to this vital truth from his own observation...\\" 1917 As it evolved and grew over time, eventually the university's name was changed to the Chicago Kindergarten Training School (1887), Chicago Kindergarten College (1893), the National Kindergarten and Elementary College (1912) and then the National College of Education (1930). The \\"National\\" part of the university's name came about when the school became the professional school of the National Kindergarten Association. The university championed the concept of kindergarten and early education teaching in America and was one of the first teachers' colleges in the country to offer a four-year program culminating in the bachelor of education degree.\\"Alice Putnam.\\" Encyclopedia of Education. The Gale Group, Inc, 2002. Retrieved 27 Jul. 2010 from http://www.answers.com/topic/alice-putnam Over the first quarter of the twentieth century, as the it continued to grow and a new generation of leadership emerged, the college would relocate a number of times: in 1913 the National Kindergarten and Elementary College campus moved to 2944 South Michigan Avenue; in 1918 Edna Dean Baker succeeded Harrison to become the second president of the college; and the college moved to Evanston, Illinois, in 1926. In the 1920s, the university partnered with Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jane Addams to provide educational opportunities to the largely poor, immigrant population served by Hull House. In 1954, the university's graduate school was accredited to offer masters and doctorate level degrees. The university organized its general liberal arts offerings into the College of Arts and Sciences in 1982, and began its business and management school in 1989, offering both bachelors and master of business administration degrees. In 1990, National Louis united the name of National College of Education with that of trustee and benefactor Michael W. Louis, the son of Henrietta Johnson Louis. Louis‚Äô significant gift spearheaded the transition from college to university and enabled the university to greatly expand its programs. NLU encompassed three colleges ‚Äî National College of Education, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Management and Business. It offered 60 academic programs, with degrees extending to the doctoral level. In 1999, the historic 22-story Peoples Gas Building at 122 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago's Downtown, built in 1910, became the flagship location of NLU. Designed by Daniel Burnham, the university's new home housed faculty and administrative offices, a library, classrooms and computer labs. In 2006, the university closed its former main site, which had of land, with about 66% in the City of Wilmette and the remainder in Evanston. This site was replaced by its current location in Skokie. In 2011, the university became the first in the United States to participate in a Groupon discount on course registration fees when a three-credit graduate-level course was offered for a 60-percent discount on the usual $2,232 fee. The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Management and Business were combined in 2014 into the College of Professional Studies and Advancement, with the programs organized in the School of Health and Human Services, the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and the School of Business and Management. In 2018, National Louis University acquired the assets of Kendall College, transferring its programs in general education, early childhood education, business, hospitality management, culinary arts, and baking & pastry, and building out entirely new facilities for the school in a newly acquired space at 18 S. Michigan Ave. In the summer of 2019, NLU took on the former students and hired former professors from now-defunct Argosy University, a for-profit institution that was abruptly forced to close due to the discontinuation of federal financial aid.\\"Left in the lurch by Argosy University‚Äôs sudden closure, students to graduate from National Louis instead,\\" https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/6/13/18662234/argosy-university-students- national-louis-for-profit-college The Argosy students were left without a way to continue their education until the possibility arose for them to transfer to NLU, which allowed them to pick up where they left off with the same classmates and professors. This also included the Illinois School of Professional Psychology's doctoral students in Clinical Psychology, who were able to complete their graduate degrees at NLU.\\"Left in the Lurch,\\" https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/6/13/18662234/argosy-university-students- national-louis-for-profit-college In 2015, NLU founded its Harrison Professional Pathways Program, an entirely new undergraduate degree program aimed at serving under-resourced but college-qualified youth in the Chicago area, specifically students graduating high school with a GPA between 2.0 and 3.0. To help students who may not be fully prepared for college, Pathways implements adaptive learning technology, Student Success Coaches, and flipped classroom environments to personalize instruction for each student. Since its founding, the Pathways program has grown in enrollment from an inaugural class of 85 students to over 1,500 in five years. Academics The university consists of four distinct colleges: The School of Professional Studies and Advancement (CPSA), Kendall College of Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management, The National College of Education (NCE), and The Undergraduate College (UGC). The Undergraduate College at National Louis University is dedicated to supporting underserved but college-qualified high school graduates in receiving an education at a reduced tuition rate. These students are able to choose between any of the university‚Äôs undergraduate degree options. In order to make classes accessible, classes are taught in many modes including face-to-face, hybrid, and online. NLU‚Äôs National College of Education (NCE) is the oldest school in the University and is where students can study in its distinguished undergraduate and graduate programs in the three broad areas of Teacher Preparation, Educational Leadership, and Educator Advancement and Specialization. CPSA consists of the school of health and human services, school of social and behavioral sciences, and school of business and management. Students may pursue an M.B.A., study in NLU's Community Psychology program, or enter the field of Health and Human Services at the Bachelor's, Master's, or Ed.D. levels. Kendall College at National Louis University offers preparation for careers in Culinary Arts, Baking and Pastry, and Hospitality management. Kendall College combines a blend of traditional academic instruction with on-site, practical experience that aims to maximally prepare its students to transition smoothly into their chosen careers. Kendall College at NLU moved into brand new facilities on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago in the summer of 2020. National Louis University offers the Professional Assistance Center for Education (P.A.C.E.) program which is three-year, post-secondary program designed to meet the transitional needs for young adults with multiple intellectual, learning, and developmental disabilities. Some of the services they provide are employment preparation, independent living skills, and social development. In October 2014, National Louis University signed a 3+1 bachelor‚Äôs degree program in the field of Human Services with College of DuPage. The program allows students to complete their four-year program at the College of DuPage campus with NLU faculty. Students can work on an Associates of Applied Science Human Services Generalist or an Associates of Applied Science in Addictions Counseling during their four-year plan. =Rankings= In 2019, U.S. News & World Report ranked National Louis University No. 195-258 in Best Education Schools and 328 in Top Performers on Social Mobility.  Downtown location  NLU - 122 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago The university owns and occupies the second through sixth floors of the downtown Chicago Peoples Gas Building on Michigan Avenue in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District, across the street from the Art Institute of Chicago. It was in borrowed rooms in the then fledgling Art Institute (in its earlier home on Michigan Avenue at Van Buren) that the university held its first classes. In December 2018 National Louis University purchase another building known as The Gage Building, at 18 S. Michigan Ave. Construction began in 2019 to create the new home of Kendall College's culinary arts and hospitality management programs.

The old norse story Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr makes Harthacnut son of the semi-mythic viking chieftain Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, himself one of the sons of the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok. The saga in turn makes Harthacnut the father of the historical king, Gorm. It has been suggested he is to be identified with the Hardegon of Northmannia whose early-10th century conquest of Denmark was related by Adam of Bremen. Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr The saga Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr relates the acts of the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, and proceeds to link them genealogically to the later rulers of the Scandinavian kingdoms. For Denmark, it relates that by Blaeja, the daughter of King √Ülla of Northumbria, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye became father of Harthacnut (H√∂r√∞a-Kn√∫tr). Harthacnut is said to have been his father's successor in Zealand, Scania and Halland, but not the break-away Viken, and he was father of Gorm. Scholarly opinion is divided as to the degree to which the material found in such heroic sources is to be taken as authentic history and genealogy. Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum of Adam of Bremen Two possible references to Harthacnut appear in the work of clergyman Adam of Bremen, who came from Germany to record the history of the Archbishops of Bremen (Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum), partly based on information from Gorm's descendant, Sweyn II of Denmark. Adam states that a king Helge was deposed and Denmark was conquered by Olof the Brash who came from Sweden (Sueonia). Along with two of his sons, Gyrd and Gnupa, Olof took the realm \\"by force of arms,\\"Adam of Bremen, trans. and ed. Francis Joseph Tschan, Timothy Reuter, History of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, Columbia University Press, 2002, p. 44. and they ruled it together, thus founding the House of Olaf in Denmark. Adam reports that they were followed by a Sigtrygg. That Sigtrygg was the son of Gnupa by a Danish noblewoman named Asfrid, and is shown on two runestones near Schleswig, erected by his mother after his death.Asfri√ær kar√æi kumbl √æaun aft Siktriku sun sin aui Knubu (Asfrith carved this gravestone after Sigtrygg, her son and Gnupa's); Ui Asfri√ær kar√æi kubl √æausi tutir U√æinkars aft Sitriuk kununt sun sin auk Knubu (Holy Asfrith carved this gravestone, Odinkar's daughter, after Sigtrygg, king, her son and Gnupa's). A. V. Storm, \\"Pages of Early Danish History, from the Runic Monuments of Sleswick and Jutland\\", The Saga=Book of the Viking club, vol. 2, pp. 328‚Äì347. Adam then relates that after Sigtrygg reigned a short time, during the tenure of Archbishop Hoger of Bremen (909‚Äì915/917), Hardegon, son of Sweyn, came from \\"Northmannia\\" the \\"land of the Northmen,\\" by which he may have meant Norway, Normandy, which had recently been colonized by Danish Vikings, or even northern Jutland. Hardegon immediately deposed the young king Sigtrygg, and then ruled unopposed for approximately thirty years. Hardegon is often equated with the Harthacnut of legend, but some historians, such as Lis Jacobsen, instead have concluded that Hardegon is distinct.Lis Jacobsen: \\"Svenskev√¶ldets Fald. Studier til Danmarks Oldhistorie i filologisk og runologisk Lys\\", K√∏benhavn, 1929 Adam later refers to an attack on Denmark by Henry I of Germany, naming the defending king as Hardecnudth Vurm in some manuscripts,filius Hardecnudth Vurm in others. Historians generally agree that Vurm (English: worm or serpent) is a German rendering of the Danish name Gorm, and this leads to alternative interpretations, that this is reference to Gorm, son (filius) of Harthacnut, or that it is a double-name indicating that Harthacnut and Gorm were the same person. The Saxon chronicles of Widukind of Corvey report the defeat and forced baptism of the Danish king Chnuba (Gnupa), in 934 at the hands of Henry I.Saxo Grammaticus. trans. Peter Fisher. Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson and Peter Fisher, eds. The history of the Danes, books I-IX, DS Brewer, 1998, v. 2, p. 162 Likewise, Olav Tryggvasson's Saga tells of Gnupa's defeat by Gorm the Old.Storm Some historians (e.g. Storm) have taken these as indications that Sigtrygg's father Gnupa still ruled at least part of Denmark much later than credited by Adam of Bremen, and his dynasty was only displaced by Harthacnut's son, Gorm. Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus  In the late and legend-influenced Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus, Harthacnut appears as Knut. He is described as a son of Erik, a descendant of Ragnar Lodbrok, by Gudorm, the granddaughter of Harald Klak. In his version of the tale, Harthacnut is raised by Ennignup (suggested to be Saxo's rendition of Gnupa), but never accepts Christianity. Silverdale treasure In the Silverdale Hoard is a silver coin impressed with the name \\"Airdeconut\\" an Anglicized variant of Harthacnut. The hoard dates to the early 10th century, but the style is similar to coins of other viking kings of Northumbria. Thus there is no reason to suggest this coin relates to a king Harthacnut of Denmark rather than an otherwise unknown Northumbrian viking. However, some have suggested that Northumbria may be the Northmannia from which Adam's Danish conqueror Hardegon came.

It was released on the PlayStation in Japan on January 27, 2000, in Europe on March 31, 2000 and in North America on August 30, 2000. It is a spin-off to the Resident Evil video game series. A Microsoft Windows version was released only in China and Taiwan on September 7, 2002. As the first release of the Gun Survivor series, this game was a major difference from the main Resident Evil series, substituting the third-person perspective of the previous games to a first-person view. The Japanese and European versions of the game were compatible with Namco's GunCon/G-Con 45 light gun, making it one of the first off-rail light gun games, whereas light-gun compatibility was removed from the North American release due to shooting games being partly blamed for the motivation of the then-recent Columbine High School massacre. It was followed by Resident Evil Survivor 2 ‚Äì Code: Veronica. Gameplay The player takes control of an amnesiac protagonist, struggling desperately against overwhelming odds to stay alive and uncover his identity. Survivor's gameplay is a combination of first-person shooter and arcade-style light gun game. The player views the environment from the perspective of the character (first person view) and moves the character through the environment with the controller. At the same time, if the player wishes to attack an enemy or destroy an object, they press a button which allows them to control a crosshair on the screen. This crosshair can be moved to any location within the main character's line of sight. When using a light gun, players move around by shooting off screen to move and the side buttons to turn, and point at the screen to shoot enemies. The game borrows its enemies from Resident Evil 2, featuring the zombie models from that game, as well as creatures such as Lickers, the Ivy plants, Moth Giants and Tyrants. In addition, Survivor also reintroduces the original Hunters from the first Resident Evil and features two new enemies in the form of the Umbrella Trashsweeper unit ‚Äì soldiers armed with machine guns ‚Äì and the Hypnos T-Type, a new Tyrant model that evolves into different forms. The player's arsenal consists almost entirely of pistols, such as the Glock 17 and the CZ75 with unlimited ammo. As the protagonist progresses through the game, the player receives larger weapons to aid in defending against even more dangerous opposition while they make their way through Umbrella's ruined city and shadowy research labs. The game features branching paths that allow the player to determine how the story will unfold and whom they will meet along the way. Plot The game takes place after the missile explosion that wiped out the contaminated Raccoon City. Not long after this incident, a helicopter crashes on the outskirts of Umbrella Corporation's private township, located on Sheena Island. The pilot escapes the burning wreckage only to find himself fighting a battle against the living dead, with no memory of his identity or his reasons for being there. During his quest, he comes across a man named Andy Holland, who knows him as Vincent Goldman, the man said to be responsible for the outbreak of T-virus in the island. Due to his amnesia, he assumes this as a fact. Moments after he gets out of the city, \\"Vincent\\" comes across Umbrella's facility, where he meets Lott and Lily Klein, two siblings whose parents used to work for Umbrella. They misjudge him because they were made to believe that Umbrella stands for the common good of all people. The two kids run away from him during their encounter, as \\"Vincent\\" follows the children outside the facility, through the canal system, and eventually to their house. He finds Lily in the house and learns from her that Lott has gone to a nearby factory alone to find a way off the island. Upon learning this, \\"Vincent\\" tells Lily to stay and take refuge until he comes back with Lott. He finds his way to the place and, after encountering many monsters, successfully infiltrates the Umbrella research facility just in time to save Lott from a Hunter. \\"Vincent\\" then learns from Lott that he is, in fact, Ark Thompson, that he was sent to Sheena Island by Leon S. Kennedy, and that Lott knew who Vincent Goldman really was. Due to his knowledge, Vincent later became a vehement enemy of Ark. However, upon this realization, the facility suddenly activates a self- destruct system that will obliterate the island within 10 minutes. Lott tells Ark that within the facility, there is a railway station that runs underground. Ark tells Lott to go ahead to the station first and regroup there. However, along his way to the station, Ark encounters the real Vincent and the Hypnos T-type Tyrant. Much to his surprise, the Umbrella executive is killed by the new bio-organic weapon, which then turns its attention to Ark, who manages to hold it off long enough to make a getaway. Ark reaches the railway station and sees Lott and Lily, safe and waiting for him. Using the railway station, they are able to arrive at a landing zone, where a helicopter waits. But on their way to safety, the Hypnos Tyrant shows up again, in a more mutated form. Ark manages to hold off the beast before joining the children in the helicopter. Persistent on its pursue, the Tyrant leaps onto the helicopter, and Ark kills it firing it off the helicopter with one of the helicopter's missiles, and then kills it with a second one. As the sun rises, Ark, Lily, and Lott flee from Sheena Island together safely, just as the island's complex self-destructs. Reception Resident Evil Survivor received mostly unfavorable reviews. Jon Thompson (AllGame) gave the game a negative review. Thompson noted that the biggest critique of the game was that it was made to be played with a light gun, which the American version did not support. He continued that even the Japanese version of the game which did include it, \\"really wasn't any better. Shooters are supposed to be quick, raw and visceral, the total opposite of what Resident Evil is, for better or worse. This shooting game opts to stick with the slow pacing of the rest of the series, and the result is a gun game with no gun that absolutely crawls along.\\" Thompson critiqued the graphics as being \\"not very attractive\\" and \\"very pixelated close-up\\" Edge praised the well-rendered 3D environments, but criticized the long loading screens between opening and closing doors. The magazine concluded that Survivor is best suited to the rental market, describing it as \\"more of a cash-in than a knockout.\\" Eric Bratcher reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"The RE universe could definitely inspire a great gun game. But with bad technology, unforgivable control limitations, and an uncanny lack of fun, this non-gun game definitely isn't it.\\" Sequels The Gun Survivor series was followed by three sequels, which were released for the PlayStation 2 and utilised the G-Con 2 peripheral. Resident Evil Survivor 2 ‚Äì Code: Veronica was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2002, based on the characters and enemies of Resident Evil ‚Äì Code: Veronica. Dino Stalker, a spin-off of the Dino Crisis series, was also released in 2002. A fourth game, Resident Evil: Dead Aim, was released in 2003.

Initially released in 2003, it was developed by Capcom Production Studio 1 and was the first entry in the Resident Evil video game series to feature cooperative gameplay and online multiplayer support, although online support was not available for the PAL versions of the game. Outbreak depicts a series of episodic storylines in a zombie-inhabited Raccoon City. Players control eight characters with unique abilites. It was set during the same general time period as Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Outbreak was followed by a standalone expansion entitled Resident Evil Outbreak: File #2. The game was praised for the graphics, fun-factor, and multiplayer but criticized for the lack of voice chat. Gameplay AI partners and vice versa. The controls and gameplay are similar to the Resident Evil remake, which was exclusive to the Nintendo GameCube, with quite a few adjustments. The player chooses a scenario, difficulty level, and a character. The difficulty level is tied to what enemies and items the player encounters as they progress through the scenario. The game has five scenarios, each of which has an event checklist consisting of special actions that the player must perform to reach 100% completion. Upon doing so the player will unlock \\"Infinity Mode\\", in which all the player's weapons never break or run out of ammunition. Each scenario also has \\"SP\\" items. These are invisible items hidden throughout the level and are randomly generated on two paths. There are 20 scenario items for each scenario, and twenty items specific to each character hidden across the five scenarios. If acquired, these items unlock new costumes and the option to listen to their ad-libs. Players were able to connect to the internet servers using a broadband connection and a network adapter. Account registration and login were required. Once players connected and logged in, they would choose between Free Mode and Scenario Mode. Free Mode took place in a lobby and allowed players to create their own games, scenarios, and difficulty level. Scenario Mode would choose the scenario and players automatically. When a player first started online, they would begin on the \\"Outbreak\\" scenario and progress from there. If the player wished to stop playing, they could save their data and restart from the scenario they were up to at the time. If the player had beaten a scenario, they acquired a star next to their name. Capcom shut down the American servers for Outbreak on December 31, 2007, and the Japanese servers on June 30, 2011, ending official online capabilities. Plot The beginning of Outbreak is set a couple of days after the initial outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City, moments before the crisis further escalates into complete chaos. The game starts with the eight characters in J's Bar, who are unaware of what is happening until a lone zombie wanders into the bar and attacks one of the employees named Will. After that, the characters must make it through the city. The game ends in the final moments of the same incident, with the player attempting to escape Raccoon City before the U.S. government launches a missile strike to eliminate the threat posed by the G-virus. The player controls one of eight characters, in order: Kevin Ryman, Mark Wilkins, Jim Chapman, George Hamilton, David King, Alyssa Ashcroft, Yoko Suzuki, and Cindy Lennox, along with numerous supporting characters who can be selected in their place. Gameplay events transpire across various regions of Raccoon City and span over a period of several days. There are five individual scenarios in this game, which are not set in chronological order. The first, \\"Outbreak\\", takes place at the beginning of the outbreak, as the police prepare to destroy the zombie horde using explosives. \\"Below Freezing Point\\" deals with the events in the former underground laboratory of Umbrella before the events of Resident Evil 2, where a rogue virologist, Monica, attempts to steal bio- weapons research and deal with her former co-worker, Yoko Suzuki. \\"The Hive\\" involves the survivors taking refuge in the Raccoon General Hospital, which is also featured in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, while it is under assault from a colony of infected leeches. \\"Hellfire\\", set the same day as \\"Outbreak\\", involves a group of survivors fleeing into the Apple Inn hotel that turns out to be on fire and swarming with lickers. The final scenario, \\"Decisions, Decisions\\", regards the survivors' search for a cure to the T-virus, which sends them to Raccoon City University, where the eight different characters must wisely choose a decision to survive the puzzling secrets hidden in the university; they must then escape the city before it is destroyed. Development =Initial planning and cancellation= According to an interview with producer Noritaka Funamizu, the first concept of Biohazard Outbreak, as it was known originally, was known before the release of Resident Evil 2 in 1998. With growing interest in the concept of network gaming over consoles, Shinji Mikami, the director of the first Resident Evil, suggested to Funamizu that he should have a try. Early on in the design, Funamizu made a small multi-player mini-game in which the player must survive the longest time possible; the team decided to remove it due to its failure to encourage teamwork‚Äîplayers would instinctively run away from the horde and be slaughtered rather than help one another to ensure their own survival. They decided that what made Resident Evil scary was its lack of multiplayer, forcing gamers to play \\"on their own\\". The team then chose that the game would follow its own story like the other games in the series, but keep the option for multi-player. The game development was later put on hold. =Revival= Prior to 2002, Capcom decided to revive development of the game, based on the research gathered from the first attempt. Production Studio 1 began its development of the game, as opposed to Mikami's Studio 4. In February 2002, a Sony press conference regarding the PlayStation 2 revealed the game‚Äîpreviously unheard-of by the public, it had a working title of Biohazard Online. This led to confusion amongst the audience before Capcom released a statement confirming its existence. Resident Evil Outbreak was a part of an initiative from Capcom's Production Studio 1 to develop three network focused games on the PlayStation 2. The other games were Auto Modellista and Monster Hunter. Capcom's goal was to have at least one of the games reach a million sales. Both Monster Hunter and Resident Evil Outbreak eventually reached this goal. The game made an appearance at Sony's conference on May 21 at E3 2002, with a video showcasing real-time 3D backgrounds (as opposed to pre-rendered); revealing four of the characters and demonstrating the ad-lib system and character communication. The \\"ad-lib system\\" was chosen over conventional microphone chat because the development team argued that it would ruin the atmosphere. Instead, limited chat options were used for conversation between users; a player would walk up to another and deliver a line from a particular conversational category (e.g. \\"help\\" and \\"go\\" categories). No solid release date was given at that time. Later that year the game was renamed Biohazard Network. By October, eighteen different scenarios were in development, with even more in the concept phase. In November, Capcom released various pieces of media, showing eight playable characters and familiar-scenarios such as \\"Flashback\\". The occupations of the characters were also given. In January 2003, further information was provided, mostly regarding interactive NPCs (non-player characters). Capcom boasted such actions as enemy NPCs who would attack the player and other ones that would run away when approached. Screenshots of \\"Flashback\\", \\"Underbelly\\", \\"The Hive\\" and other scenarios were released. By May 2003, the game's title had been changed. This time, it had been changed to Biohazard Outbreak (Resident Evil Outbreak outside Japan), and the number of scenarios was reduced to the five scenarios. Another five scenarios did not make the initial cut, although they were complete enough to be featured in the E3 2002 trailer, and were developed into the sequel Resident Evil Outbreak File #2. In September, doubts were raised as to Outbreaks online game-play in Europe, but Capcom was adamant that it would at least try to find a way to solve the problem in time for release. =Release= Promotion at E3 2003 The European release was heavily delayed, finally released in September 2004‚Äînine months after Japan and the United States saw its release. Back in March Capcom had given in on securing Outbreaks network due to the numerous problems faced with establishing a network in a region simultaneously for dozens of languages, and securing service providers; as well as the usual PAL/NTSC differential.  Reception  Outbreak received a \\"C+\\" from 1UP.com in their review. The staff referred to it as \\"another typical entry in the RE canon\\", and as a \\"competent game\\" with \\"controls [that] are actually functional and somewhat intuitive\\". However, they cited a number of problems with the game, notably Capcom's choice of not installing voice chat in favor of the ad-lib system. They found the game's five scenarios to be short, and AI partners to be \\"chock-full of repetitive and annoying sound bytes\\". Eurogamer was disappointed with Capcom's failure to establish online support for the European market at a time when the PlayStation 2's online community was threatened with the expected rise in the Xbox's popularity with the upcoming release of Halo 2, stating that an Outbreak was \\"designed from the ground up to be a co-operative multiplayer game for four players\\" and questioning if a network-less game would be of interest to players. Another problem was with the real-time \\"START\\" menu, which meant that file-reading and item-trading would make the player vulnerable to a random zombie attack, making the game \\"[feel] light in the story department\\" as a consequence of not becoming immersed in the environment. Long load times for the PAL version was also noted in the review.

He oversaw all archaeological activities of the latter institution in general and the excavations of Dura- Europos in particular. He is believed to have coined the term \\"caravan city\\". While working in Russia, Rostovtzeff became an authority on the ancient history of South Russia and Ukraine. He summed up his knowledge on the subject in Iranians and Greeks in South Russia (1922) and Skythien und der Bosporus (1925). His most important archaeological findings at Yale were described in Dura-Europos and Its Art (1938). Glen Bowersock described Rostovtzeff's views as having been largely formed by the age of thirty, developing mainly only in the quality of execution in later life, and making him \\"the last of the nineteenth-century ancient historians\\".Bowersock, G.W. \\"The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire by Michael Ivanovitch Rostovtzef\\" in Daedalus, Vol. 103, No. 1, Twentieth-Century Classics Revisited (Winter, 1974), pp. 15‚Äì23. Rostovtzeff was known as a proud and slightly overpowering man who did not fit in easily. In later life, he suffered from depression. The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire Rostovtzeff was notable for his theories of the cause of the collapse of the Roman Empire which he expounded in detail in his magisterial The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire (1926). Scarred by his experience of fleeing from the Russian Revolution, he attributed the collapse of the Roman Empire to an alliance between the rural proletariat and the military in the third century A.D. Despite not being a Marxist himself, Rostovtzeff used terms such as proletariat, bourgeoisie and capitalism freely in his work and the importation of those terms into a description of the ancient world, where they did not necessarily apply, caused criticism. Rostovtzeff's theory was quickly understood as one based on the author's own experiences and equally quickly rejected by the academic community. Bowersock later described the book as \\"the marriage of pre-1918 scholarly training and taste with post-1918 personal experience and reflection.\\" At the same time, however, the detailed scholarship involved in the production of the work impressed his contemporaries and he was one of the first to merge archaeological evidence with literary sources.

Knight for Imagine Entertainment and Universal Pictures. It stars Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd, Peter Boyle and Stephen Furst as mental-hospital inpatients who are left unsupervised in New York City during a field trip gone awry. Jon Connolly and David Loucka wrote the screenplay. Plot Dr. Jeff Weitzman (Dennis Boutsikaris) is a psychologist working in a sanitarium in New Jersey. His primary patients are Billy, Henry, Jack and Albert. Billy (Keaton) is the most normal of the group and their unofficial leader, though he is a pathological liar with delusions of grandeur and violent tendencies. Henry (Lloyd) is obsessive/compulsive and he has deluded himself into thinking he is one of the doctors at the hospital, often walking around with a clipboard, lab coat and stethoscope. Jack (Boyle) is a former advertising executive who believes he is Jesus Christ. Finally, Albert (Furst) is a man-child who can only communicate using baseball terminology, particularly from former ball player and commentator Phil Rizzuto. Convinced that his patients need some fresh air and some time away from the sanitarium, Dr. Weitzman persuades the administration to allow him to take them to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium. Unfortunately, he accidentally encounters two crooked cops just as they murder another officer. The doctor then gets knocked unconscious trying to get away and is put in the hospital. The group is now stranded in New York City, forced to cope with a place which is often more bizarre than their sanitarium. After Dr. Weitzman's beating and coma, it is up to the patients to save their doctor from being murdered by the crooked cops. They end up having to both use and overcome their delusions and disorders in order to save the only man who ever tried to help them, with both the police and the killers looking for them. Three revisit scenes from their pasts: Billy (former girlfriend Riley, played by Lorraine Bracco), Henry (his wife and daughter), and Jack (his former employer). As each patient does so individually, they each behave in a sane, clear manner, Henry genuinely missing his family, Billy wishing to pursue a stronger relationship, and Jack appealing to his boss that he and his friends are in trouble (but the boss reports Jack to the police). Ultimately, the patients succeed in turning in the criminals. Their doctor makes a recovery and the patients again attempt a trip to the ballpark, this time with no supervision.

On those occasions when it is funny, the humor less often prompts laughter than mute appreciation of the talents of the principal performers - Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd and Peter Boyle.\\" Michael Wilmington noted that \\"[the film] is so clearly derived from the movie \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" that you might begin to wonder when Jack Nicholson will show up. [...which] may suggest that \\"Dream Team\\" is a weak, derivative, somehow disreputable movie, which is somewhat true. If you compare it to its obvious source, it has a coy, flip attitude toward illness, skating over the surface of tragedy, dementia and pain without breaking the ice. The union of four oddballs‚Äîrebel-writer, obsessive noodge, religious fanatic and couch potato‚Äîis almost too schematic, as if the writers were somehow trying to define '80s dissidence. But even though you can predict virtually everything that happens from the first five minutes on, the director and actors manage to hook you in.\\" It currently holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 14 reviews. =Box office= The Dream Team debuted at No. 2 at the American box office, where it made $5.7 million at 1,316 theaters, averaging US$4,335 per screen. It opened only one number shy of a competing Paramount film, Major League. It went down from that position in subsequent weeks.

It is the seventh major installment in the Resident Evil series, and was announced in 2005‚Äîthe same year its predecessor Resident Evil 4 was released. Resident Evil 5 was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in March 2009 and for Microsoft Windows in September that year. The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance agents Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. Chris learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, Albert Wesker, and his former partner, Jill Valentine. The gameplay of Resident Evil 5 is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay. It has also been considered to be the first game in the main series to depart from the survival horror genre, with critics saying it bore more resemblance to an action game. Motion capture was used for the cutscenes, and it was the first video game to use a virtual camera system. Several staff members from the original Resident Evil worked on Resident Evil 5. The PC version was developed by Mercenary Technology. Resident Evil 5 received a positive reception, despite some criticism for its control scheme. The game received some complaints of racism, though an investigation by the British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. Resident Evil 5 was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. As of June 2020, the original release has sold over 7.7 million units. A special edition of the game and releases on other platforms sold an additional 4.1 million units, bringing the total sales to 11.8 million. It is the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise, and the original version remained the best-selling individual Capcom release until March 2018, when it was outsold by Monster Hunter: World. A sequel, Resident Evil 6, was released in 2012. Plot In 2009, five years after the events of Resident Evil 4, Chris Redfield, now an agent of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), is dispatched to Kijuju in Africa. He and his new partner Sheva Alomar are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. When they arrive, they discover that the locals have been infected by the parasites Las Plagas (those infected are called \\"Majini\\") and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed. Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA's Delta Team, which includes Sheva's mentor Captain Josh Stone. In Stone's data Chris sees a photograph of Jill Valentine, his old partner, who has been presumed dead after a confrontation with Albert Wesker. Chris, Sheva and Delta Team close in on Irving, but he escapes with the aid of a hooded figure. Irving leaves documents that lead Chris and Sheva to marshy oilfields. This is where Irving's deal is to occur, but they discover that the documents are a diversion. When Chris and Sheva try to regroup with Delta Team, they find the team slaughtered by a BOW; Sheva cannot find Stone among the dead. Determined to learn if Valentine is still alive, Chris does not report to headquarters. Continuing through the marsh, they find Stone and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects himself with a variant of the Las Plagas parasite and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Chris and Sheva defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by the Umbrella Corporation, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Chris finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Chris and Sheva pursue Gionne but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Chris and Sheva fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Chris to follow Wesker. Chris and Sheva board the tanker and encounter Gionne, who escapes after dropping a case of syringes; Sheva keeps several. When Chris and Sheva reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Chris and Sheva defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Sheva realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Chris and Sheva disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚Äö Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Chris and Sheva through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Chris and Sheva are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Chris and Sheva fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Chris wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Sheva and Valentine, he decides to live in a world without fear. Gameplay The first player controls Chris Redfield, while a second player can control Sheva Alomar. Players are controlled from an over-the-shoulder perspective. Resident Evil 5 is a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective. Players can use several weapons including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and grenade launchers, as well as melee attacks. Players can make quick 180-degree turns to evade enemies. The game involves boss battles, many of which contain quick time events. As in its predecessor Resident Evil 4, players can upgrade weapons with money and treasure collected in-game and heal themselves with herbs, but cannot run and shoot at the same time. New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades, the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen without having to find a merchant, and the equipping of weapons and items in real-time during gameplay. Each player can store nine items. Unlike the previous games, the item size is irrelevant; a herb or a grenade launcher each occupy one space, and four items may be assigned to the D-pad. The game features puzzles, though fewer than previous titles. Resident Evil 5 is the first game in the Resident Evil series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay. The player controls Chris, a former member of the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Sheva, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Sheva is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Sheva the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's storyline is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cutscenes. A version of the Mercenaries minigame, which debuted in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, is included in Resident Evil 5. This minigame places the player in an enclosed environment with a time limit. Customized weapons cannot be used and players must search for weapons, ammunition, and time bonuses while fighting a barrage of enemies, to score as many points as possible within the time limit. The minigame multiplayer mode was initially offline only; a release-day patch needed to be downloaded to access the online multiplayer modes. Mercenaries is unlocked when the game's story mode has been completed. Development Producer alt=A portrait shot of a middle-aged Asian man with short, messy black hair, glasses and a zip-up sweatshirt Resident Evil 5 was developed by Capcom and produced by Jun Takeuchi, who directed Onimusha: Warlords and produced Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. Keiji Inafune, promotional producer for Resident Evil 2 and executive producer of the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4, supervised the project. Production began in 2005 and at its peak, over 100 people were working on the project. In February 2007, some members of Capcom's Clover Studio began working on Resident Evil 5 while others were working on Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, which debuted for the Wii. Yasuhiro Anpo, who worked as a programmer on the original Resident Evil, directed Resident Evil 5. He was one of several staff members who worked on the original game to be involved in Resident Evil 5 development. The game's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda. Takeuchi announced that the game would retain the gameplay model introduced in Resident Evil 4, with \\"thematic tastes\\" from both Resident Evil 4 and the original Resident Evil. While previous Resident Evil games are mainly set at night, the events of Resident Evil 5 occur almost entirely during the day. The decision for this was a combination of the game being set in Africa and advances in hardware improvements which allowed increasingly detailed graphics. On the subject of changes to Valentine and Chris's appearance, production director Yasuhiro Anpo explained that designers tried \\"to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time\\". Their new designs retained the character's signature colors; green for Chris and blue for Valentine. Sheva was redesigned several times during production, though all versions tried to emphasize a combination of \\"feminine attraction and the strength of a fighting woman\\". The Majini were designed to be more violent than the \\"Ganado\\" enemies in Resident Evil 4. The decision for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, for a new experience in a Resident Evil game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly on top of the second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down as an influence on the setting of Resident Evil 5 and his experience working on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular gaming console at the time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision \\"from a business perspective\\", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made. Resident Evil 5 runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's MT Framework engine and scenes were recorded by motion capture. It was the first video game to use a virtual camera system, which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion-capture actors recorded. Actors Reuben Langdon, Karen Dyer and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield, Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker respectively. Dyer also voiced Sheva, while Chris's voice was performed by Roger Craig Smith. Dyer's background training in circus skills helped her win the role of Sheva, as Capcom were searching for someone who could handle the physical skills her motion capture required. She performed her own stunts, and worked in production on the game for over a year, sometimes working 14 hours a day. All of the human character motions were based on motion capture, while the non- human characters in the game were animated by hand. Kota Suzuki was the game's principal composer and additional music was contributed by Hideki Okugawa, Akihiko Narita and Seiko Kobuchi. The electronic score includes 15 minutes of orchestral music, recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage of 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles with the 103-piece Hollywood Studio Symphony. Other orchestral music and arrangements were by Wataru Hokoyama, who conducted the orchestra. Capcom recorded in Los Angeles because they wanted a Hollywood- style soundtrack to increase the game's cinematic value and global interest. Resident Evil 5 soundtrack features an original theme song, titled \\"Pray\\", which was composed by Suzuki and sung by Oulimata Niang. Marketing and release Capcom announced Resident Evil 5 on July 20, 2005, and the company showed a brief trailer for the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in July 2007. The full E3 trailer became available on the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store that same month. A new trailer debuted on Spike TV's GameTrailers TV in May 2008, and on the GameTrailers website. A playable game demo was released in Japan on December 5, 2008, for the Xbox 360, in North America and Europe for the Xbox 360 on January 26, 2009, and on February 2 for the PlayStation 3. Worldwide downloads of the demo exceeded four million for the two consoles; over 1.8 million were downloaded between January 26 and January 29. In January 2009, D+PAD Magazine reported that Resident Evil 5 would be released with limited-edition Xbox 360 box art; pictures of the limited-edition box claimed that it would allow two to sixteen players to play offline via System Link. Although Capcom said that their \\"box art isn't lying\\", the company did not provide details. Capcom soon issued another statement that the box-art information was incorrect, and System Link could support only two players. Microsoft released a limited-edition, red Xbox 360 Elite console which was sold with the game. The package included an exclusive Resident Evil theme for the Xbox 360 Dashboard and a voucher for Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix from Xbox Live. Resident Evil 5 was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in March 2009, alongside a dedicated Game Space on PlayStation Home. The space, Resident Evil 5 \\"Studio Lot\\" (Biohazard 5 \\"Film Studio\\" in Japan), had as its theme the in-game location of Kijuju. Its lounge offered Resident Evil 5-related items for sale, events and full game-launching support. Some areas of the space were available only to owners of Resident Evil 5. A Microsoft Windows version was released in September 2009. This version, using Nvidia's 3D Vision technology through DirectX 10, includes more costumes and a new mode in the Mercenaries minigame. Resident Evil 5 was re-released on Shield Android TV in May 2016, and was re- released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the following month, with a physical disc copy following in America that July. It was also released for Nintendo Switch on October 29, 2019. Additional content Shortly before the release of Resident Evil 5, Capcom announced that a competitive multiplayer mode called Versus would be available for download in several weeks. Versus became available for download in Europe and North America on April 7, 2009, through the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. Versus has two online game types: \\"Slayers\\", a point-based game challenging players to kill Majini, and \\"Survivors\\", where players hunt each other while dodging and attacking Majini. Both modes can be played by two-player teams. The Microsoft Windows version of Resident Evil 5 originally did not support downloadable content (DLC). During Sony's press conference at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show Capcom announced that a special edition of the game, Biohazard 5: Alternative Edition, would be released in Japan for the PlayStation 3 in the spring of 2010. This edition supports the PlayStation Move accessory and includes a new scenario, \\"Lost in Nightmares\\", where Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine infiltrate one of Umbrella Corporation co-founder Oswell E. Spencer's estates in 2006. Another special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America and Europe. Gold Edition includes \\"Lost in Nightmares\\" and another campaign-expansion episode, \\"Desperate Escape\\", where players control Josh Stone and Jill Valentine as they assist Chris and Sheva. The edition also includes the previously released Versus mode, four new costumes and an alternate Mercenaries mode with eight new playable characters, new items and maps. Like Alternative Edition, Gold Edition supports the PlayStation Move accessory with a patch released on September 14, 2010. The Xbox 360 version of Gold Edition came in a DVD with a token allowing free download of all DLC, while the PlayStation 3 version had all of the new content on a single Blu-ray disc. On November 5, 2012, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition was placed on the PlayStation Network as a free download for PlayStation Plus users during that month. As part of the game's conversion to Steamworks, Gold Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 26, 2015. Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games for Windows ‚Äì Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did not allow the use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or fan modifications, though Capcom later confirmed a way to work around these issues. Reception Resident Evil 5 received generally favourable reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised the game's visuals and content. Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine complimented the game's fast pace, and called the graphics gorgeous. It was praised by Joe Juba and Matt Miller of Game Informer, who said that it had the best graphics of any game to date and that the music and voice acting helped bring the characters to life, and Brian Crecente of Kotaku said it was one of the most visually stunning games he had ever played. Adam Sessler of X-Play said the game's graphics were exceptional, and Edge praised the gameplay as exhilarating and frantic. For IGN, Ryan Geddes wrote that the game had a surprisingly high replay value, and GameZone Louis Bedigian said the game was \\"worth playing through twice in one weekend\\". While still giving favorable reviews of the game, several reviewers considered it to be a departure from the survival horror genre, a decision they lamented. Chris Hudak of Game Revolution considered the game to be a \\"full-on action blockbuster\\", and Brian Crecente said that about halfway through the game it \\"dropp[ed] all pretense of being a survival horror title and unmask[ed] itself as an action shooter title\\". Kristan Reed of Eurogamer said the game \\"morphs what was a survival horror adventure into a survival horror shooter\\", and believed that this attempt to appeal to action gamers would upset some of the series' fans. Aspects of the game's control scheme were viewed negatively by critics. James Mielke of 1UP.com criticized several inconsistencies in the game, such as only being able to take cover from enemy fire in very specific areas. Mielke also criticized its controls, saying that aiming was too slow and noting the inability to strafe away from (or quickly jump back from) enemies. Despite the problems he found it was \\"still a very fun game\\". Kristan Reed also had criticism of some controls, such as the speed at which 180-degree turns were performed and difficulty accessing inventory. Joe Juba said that the inability to move and shoot at the same time seemed more \\"like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension.\\" While praising some aspects of the AI control of Sheva, Ryan Geddes thought that it also had its annoyances, such as its tendency to recklessly expend ammunition and health supplies. Reception of the downloadable content was favorable. Steven Hopper of GameZone rated the \\"Lost in Nightmares\\" DLC eight out of ten, saying that despite the episode's brevity it had high replay value and the addition of new multiplayer elements made it a \\"worthy investment for fans of the original game.\\" Samuel Claiborn of IGN rated the \\"Desperate Escape\\" DLC seven out of ten: \\"Despite Desperate Escape's well-crafted action sequences, I actually found myself missing the unique vibe of Lost in Nightmares. The dynamic between Jill and Josh isn't particularly thrilling, and the one- liners, banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum.\\" =Allegations of racism= Resident Evil 5s 2007 E3 trailer was criticized for depicting a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small African village. According to Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal, \\"There was a lot of imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery\\", although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released. Takeuchi said the game's producers were completely surprised by the complaints. The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Sheva, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Sheva's character was added to address the issue of racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of Resident Evil 5. He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were \\"able to play the game and see what it is for themselves\\". In a Computer and Video Games interview, producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue: \\"We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business‚Äîwe're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way.\\" In Eurogamer February 2009 preview of Resident Evil 5, Dan Whitehead expressed concern about controversy the game might generate: \\"It plays so blatantly into the old clich√©s of the dangerous 'dark continent' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you'd swear the game was written in the 1920s\\". Whitehead said that these issues became more \\"outrageous and outdated\\" as the game progressed and that the addition of the \\"light-skinned\\" Sheva just made the overall issue worse. Hilary Goldstein from IGN believed that the game was not deliberately racist, and though he did not personally find it offensive, he felt that others would due to the subjective nature of offensiveness. Chris Hudak dismissed any allegations of racism as \\"stupid\\". Karen Dyer, who is of Jamaican descent, also dismissed the claims. She said that in over a year of working on the game's development she never encountered anything racially insensitive, and would not have continued working there if she had. Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com said that despite the controversy the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations \\"silly\\", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an \\"inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black\\". It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed \\"black men\\" dragging off a screaming white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was \\"not obviously black\\". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, \\"There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [and he] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa it is hardly surprising that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case, there is no issue around racism.\\" Academic journals and conferences, however, have continued to comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andr√© Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been intended by Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences. Writing for The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference in 2015, Harrer and Pichlmair considered Resident Evil 5 to be \\"yet another moment in the history of commodity racism, which from the late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter the most intimate spaces of European homes\\". The authors state that Africa is presented from a Western gaze; \\"what is presented as 'authentic' blackness conforms to the projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience\\". In 2016, Paul Martin from Games and Culture said that the theme of the game could be described as \\"dark continent\\", stating it drew on imagery of European colonialism and depictions of \\"Blackness\\" reminiscent of 19th-century European theories on race. =Sales= The PlayStation 3 version of Resident Evil 5 was the top-selling game in Japan in the two weeks following its release, with 319,590 copies sold. In March 2009, it became the fastest-selling game of the franchise in the United Kingdom, and the biggest Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game release in the country. By June 2020, Resident Evil 5 had sold 7.7 million copies worldwide between PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and download, and the Gold Edition had sold an additional 2.3 million copies across those systems. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions sold another 1.8 million copies combined, bringing the total sales to 11.8 million units. The original release of Resident Evil 5 was Capcom's best-selling individual edition of a game until March 2018, when Monster Hunter: Worlds sales reached 7.5 million units, compared to 7.3 million for Resident Evil 5 at the time. As of June 2020, when taking into consideration the sales of all versions and re-releases of titles, Resident Evil 5 was the third-best-selling Capcom game overall, behind Monster Hunter: World (16.1 million) and Street Fighter II (14.05 million), Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix: 250,000 Ultra Street Fighter II: 450,000 and it remains the best-selling title in the Resident Evil franchise, outselling its closest rivals Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 6 by 1.6 million and 2 million units, respectively. =Awards= Resident Evil 5 won the \\"Award of Excellence\\" at the 2009 Japan Game Awards. It was nominated for both Best Action/Adventure Game and Best Console Game at the 2008 Game Critics Awards, Best Action Game at the 2009 IGN Game of the Year Awards, and Best Sound Editing in Computer Entertainment at the 2010 Golden Reel Awards. It received five nominations at the 2010 Game Audio Network Guild Awards: Audio of the Year, Best Cinematic/Cut-Scene Audio, Best Dialogue, Best Original Vocal Song ‚Äì Pop (for the theme song \\"Pray\\") and Best Use of Multi- Channel Surround in a Game. Karen Dyer was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance at the 2010 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Awards, and the game received a nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction.

History =Beginning of the Sound Era= While the breakthrough Universal horror films of 1931, Dracula and Frankenstein used little or no music apart from for title sequences, Franz Waxman's score for Bride of Frankenstein is often cited as one of the first modern film scores. The late 1930s and 1940s saw unknown and often uncredited composers such as Hans J. Salter and Frank Skinner setting the tone for later horror music. Often the music was darkly and lushly romantic, but heavily influenced by impressionism, atonality and serialism. A chief example is The Wolf Man (1940), to which Salter and Skinner both contributed. =Hammer Horror (1950s-'70s)= The British Hammer horrors of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s owed their musical feel to composer James Bernard, whose pacey, often frenetic, jarring scores to films such as Dracula (1958), The Plague of the Zombies (1966) and The Devil Rides Out (1968) are among his best-known. Bernard was fond of using the score to play along with the title of the film‚Äîhis three- note signature for Dracula can be sung, and by prefiguring it with another four notes, Bernard could underscore the main title of Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact, Hammer employed a number of other composers, including Franz Reizenstein (The Mummy, 1959), Malcolm Williamson (The Brides of Dracula, 1960) and Tristram Cary (Quatermass and the Pit, 1967, and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, 1971). Despite the obvious atonal influence on the earlier Universal film scores, Benjamin Frankel's 1960 score for The Curse of the Werewolf (1960) is believed by some to contain the first film theme to be based entirely on Arnold Schoenberg's Twelve-Tone scale. =1960s onwards= On the other side of the Atlantic, it was perhaps Bernard Herrmann's string score for Hitchcock's Psycho that changed the sound of horror music. The stabbing rhythms of the famous shower scene have been imitated many times since. The 1970s saw a new wave of slasher films, which tended to have more contemporary-sounding scores, often using electronic instruments. Horror director John Carpenter was well known for scoring his own films, such as Halloween (1978). For The Exorcist, William Friedkin rejected a score by Lalo Schiffrin and used the temp track featuring assorted pieces of music including part of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells.Essay on music and horror films  References  \\\\- Category:Film scores ","title":"Horror film score"},{"id":"2093525","text":"Ignaz Vincenz Zingerle. Ignaz Vincenz Zingerle (6 June 1825 - 17 September 1892) was an Austrian poet and scholar. Zingerle was born, the son of the Roman Catholic theologian and orientalist Pius Zingerle (1801-1881), at Meran. He began his studies at Trento, and entered for a while the Benedictine monastery at Marienberg. Abandoning the clerical profession, he returned to Innsbruck, where, in 1848, he became teacher in the gymnasium, and in 1859 professor of German language and literature at the university. He died at Innsbruck in September 1892. Zingerle is known as author through his Zeitgedichte (Innsbruck, 1848); Von den Alpen (1850); Die M√ºllerin, a village tale (1853); Der Bauer von Longfall (1874); and Erz√§hlungen aus dem Burggrafenamte (1884). His ethnographical writings and literary studies, dealing especially with Tirol, have, however, rendered him more famous. Among them may be mentioned his editions of K√∂nig Laurin (1859), of the legend, Von den heyligen drei K√∂nigen (1855); Sagen aus Tirol (1850, 2nd ed. 1891); Tirol: Natur, Geschichte und Sage im Spiegel deutscher Dichtung (1851); Die Personen- und Taufnamen Tirols (1855); Sitten, Br√§uche und Meinungen des Tiroler Volkes (2nd ed. 1871); Das deutsche Kinderspiel im Mittelalter (2nd ed. 1873); Schildereien aus Tirol (1877, new series, 1888).

Geography Ellastone lies on the River Dove and is a hive of fluvial activity. Two small brooks (Sandford Brook and Tit Brook) flow directly into the River Dove. Additionally there is a natural spring, still officially known as Bentley Well, which flows into the Tit and sits on former farmland which is now occupied by a new development, Bentley Fold. The Dove is the historic boundary between the two counties of Derbyshire and Staffordshire, and some of its crossings and bridges were once important elements of the main coaching road from London to the ports of the North-West. The modern village Today the village, despite being on the busy B5032 road, misses out on the majority of the traffic for the often crowded Alton Towers theme park, which leaves the road just to the south at the J. C. Bamford World Headquarters in Rocester. Due to this, Ellastone residents do not receive free Alton Towers tickets despite its proximity to the attraction. The village does however attract some foot and horse tourism, as it lies near the southern end of the Limestone Way, a long distance bridleway. Ellastone's current amenities include a village hall, tennis court, bowling green, park and snooker club. Although Ellastone is on the Staffordshire side of the border, it currently has a Derbyshire postal address because the nearest postal town of Ashbourne is in Derbyshire. History Ellastone, a linear village, situated close to the River Dove, on the border between Derbyshire and Staffordshire. The village can be traced back to Anglo-Saxon times in documentation and it features in the Domesday Book, where it is listed as Edelachestone, ElachestoneGreat Domesday Book folios 247r and 249r and as Princestone. The Ellastone Parish Register (1907) records the variant spellings, to be found in early medieval manuscripts, as: \\"Edelachestone, Elachestone, Ethelaxton, Ethelaston, Adlaxton, Athelaxton, Adelachestone, Adalacheston, Edelestone.\\" One of the village cottages was once owned by William Cecil, the influential politician and confident of Elizabeth I. That was probably due to that part of the Peak then being on the main road to London, as evidence by the later coaching route. The local church of St. Peter's dates back to the 16th century with the year 1586 displayed on the tower. Ellastone was served by a railway station (shared with Norbury) which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 31 May 1852. During World War II, the bridge over the River Dove was an important crossing point, guarded by two pill-boxes, one on each bank. Both are still visible today, however the box on the western side of the bridge is harder to spot as it is currently serving as a shelter for the cows, but camouflage paint is still visible above the entrance. The nearby bridge over the River Dove to Norbury in Derbyshire. Ellastone Old Hall, formerly the Bromley Arms pub, dates from the seventeenth century and is situated close to the current pub, the Duncombe Arms. There used to be a petrol station in the village and its presence can be noted through the unusual drives of the two bungalows closest to the pub, which very much resemble the entry/exits of a petrol station forecourt. The village shop and sub Post Office was closed on 15 April 2006. Ellastone Parish The wider Parish of Ellastone originally had six townships: Ellaston; Calwich; Prestwood; Ramsor; Stanton and Wootton. Today Ellastone Parish remains extensive, and includes the hamlets of Ramshorn, Wootton, and Prestwood. The Weaver Hills, about four miles north-west, lie just outside the Parish. Ellastone is situated in the now obsolete Hundred of Totmonslow. The Hundred had two major divisions and each had its own constable and Petty Sessions. The Petty Sessions for the South division were held at Ellastone The English Counties Delineated, Volume 2, by Thomas Moule, 1837. Page 138 Literary references Ellastone features as 'Hayslope' in George Eliot's Adam Bede, published in 1859. It earned this recognition because the author's father spent the early part of his life in the village working as a carpenter... :\\"It was at Ellastone that Robert Evans, George Eliot's father, passed his early years and worked as a carpenter with his brother Samuel; and it was partly from reminiscences of her father's talk and from her uncle Samuel's wife's preaching experiences that the author constructed the very powerful and moving story of Adam Bede.\\"The Living Age, Volume 303, 1919. There is 'Adam Bede cottage' in the village, so named because it was the family home of the Evans's, the family of \\"George Elliot\\",- Mary Ann Evans. Her uncle lived there during her lifetime and it is said that she did visit. The Methodist references in Adam Bede fit this locality well. Primitive Methodist was born nearby at Mow Cop and the hamlet of Ramshorn (known as Ramsor in Methodist documents) at the western end of the Parish of Ellastone was very significant in the early history of Primitive Methodism.Some of the significance of Ramsor in Primitive Methodism is collated on the Rewlach Methodist History site However the reality of the conversion of Hetty (a character in Adam Bede) is suspect in the light of early Primitive Methodist histories.Various 19th- century Methodist histories are available on Other points of historical interest The ruined Calwich Abbey is also situated nearby. An abbey was first built on the site in 1148, however the latest hall, built in 1848, was demolished in 1935, leaving only the stable block which is visible today. The composer Handel was one of the abbey's guests on several occasions. As such it has been suggested that it may have inspired some of his most important pieces such as \\"Messiah\\" and the \\"Water Music\\". Until demolition in 1935 there was a Wootton Hall built by Inigo Jones circa 1730, and formerly visited by the fleeing French political philosopher Rousseau. Arthur Mee notes that this visit was not entirely a happy one.Arthur Mee, \\"The King's England; Staffordshire\\", (1937), p. 243 The jibes of the London wits, poking fun at Rousseau's hiding out in the hills, reveal that the place was then known as \\"Wootton under Weaver\\", a place were \\"where God came never\\" - meaning that it was known as one of the least Christian places in England. Wootton Hall has since been rebuilt at a smaller size as the residence of the Hon. Johnny Greenall of the brewing family. Also within the parish is Wootton Lodge, a 17th-century house with deer park. This is an imposing property which has served many notable owners, but which is now owned by the Bamford family (JCB).

The bridge, situated over the Dadu River in Luding County, Garz√™ Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China, was located about 80 kilometers west of the city of Ya'an and was a river crossing vital to the Red Army. Overview of the bridge's role in the Long March Fleeing from pursuing Chinese Nationalist forces, the communists found that there were not enough boats to cross the Dadu River (Sichuan province). Thus, they were forced to use Luding Bridge, a Qing dynasty suspension bridge built in 1701.Crossing of the Luding Bridge The bridge consisted of thirteen heavy iron chains with a span of some 100 yards. Thick wooden boards lashed over the chains provided the roadway across the bridge. On the morning of May 30, 1935 the 4th regiment of Lin Biao's 2nd division, 1st Corps of the Chinese Red Army received an urgent order from general headquarters: Luding Bridge must be captured on May 29, 1935, one day ahead of the original schedule. The 4th regiment then marched 120 km in less than 24 hours. Along the way, they engaged and defeated numerous nationalist forces which blocked their path. On the dawn of May 29, 1935, Lin Biao's troops reached the bridge, only to discover that local warlords allied with the ruling Kuomintang had removed most of the planks on the bridge. Furthermore, Luding City itself was occupied by a regiment of troops from warlord Liu Wenhui's 38th Brigade, 4th brigade, under the 5th division of the 24th Corps. The brigade's commander, Li Quanshan (ÊùéÂÖ®Â±±), was also a wealthy opium dealer. This was a common business for many of the local warlord commanders. Li Quanshan's (ÊùéÂÖ®Â±±) direct superior, Yuan Guorui (Ë¢ÅÂõΩÁëû), the commander of the 4th brigade, was reputed to be an opium addict himself, as were most of the troops . Li divided his regiment into two parts, with two battalions deployed inside Luding City, while another battalion was deployed some distance outside in the suburb. His defending forces still enjoyed numerical superiority over the attacking Red Army. The 4th regiment had lost considerable strength during the hurried 24-hour march - approximately two- thirds of the soldiers had fallen behind during the march - and only a battalion-sized force had reached the western bank of the Luding Bridge that morning. =Local warlord politics= Relationship between local warlords A major factor that contributed to the Chinese Red Army's victory was that the local warlords were mainly concerned with Chiang Kai-shek and his plans to take over their territories, and they felt much less threatened by the Red Army's passing through. The area containing Luding bridge was controlled by the warlord Liu Wenhui (ÂàòÊñáËæâ), who fought the civil wars in Sichuan Province against his own nephew, the warlord Liu Xiang (ÂàòÊπò). Liu Xiang managed to have nearly all of the other warlords in Sichuan join him in the struggle against his uncle. Chiang ostensibly remained neutral at the beginning of Sichuan's provincial conflicts in order to weaken the local warlords by letting them fight each other. Once the provincial warlords were weak and in disarray, Chiang's forces moved in and took over. Gradually, it was apparent that the nephew would prevail over the uncle because the nephew was willing to take heavy troop losses in exchange for territory. The uncle was unwilling to sacrifice large number of his troops during initial skirmishes with his nephew. Knowing Liu Xiang would probably not survive a massive counterattack from Liu Wenhui, Chiang shifted his support to the nephew Liu Xiang. But the anticipated counterattack from Liu Wenhui never came. Liu Xiang eventually defeated his own uncle, Liu Wenhui, forcing the latter to retreat to Xikang Province. Chiang was then able to face a weak alliance of smaller warlords rather than confront a single strong warlord that dominated the entire province. As Chiang had expected, when Liu Wenhui's defeat became obvious, the smaller alliance of warlords soon existed in name only. As a result of the provincial conflicts Liu Wenhui, like the other warlords, was extremely reluctant to commit his force in any significant numbers to fight the Red Army. Knowing that the communists were only passing by, Liu Wenhui, like other warlords, preserved his forces to fight other warlords in Sichuan. Strength preservation was vital to his survival: his force had been reduced to 20,000 from its previous peak of 120,000. Relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and local warlords In addition to preserving forces to fight others, the local warlords were also keen to preserve their forces to keep Chiang out of their own territory. Prior to the Red Army entering Sichuan Province, Chiang's army had followed the Red Army into the neighboring Guizhou province, ostensibly to help the local warlord, Wang Jialie (ÁéãÂÆ∂ÁÉà), fight them. When the Red Army left Guizhou, Chiang's troops remained. Blamed for failing to stop the Red Army, Wang Jialie was removed by Chiang with the backup of his newly deployed troops in the province. The local warlords knew that they could return and regain control of their territory after the Red Army had left; however, if Chiang's army came, they would be removed for good. Therefore, despite Chiang's advisors' accurate prediction of the need of at least three regiments‚Äîand possibly four or five‚Äîof the local warlord's troops to stop a single Red Army regiment, the local warlord only deployed a single regiment at Luding Bridge. The main force was deployed to block Chiang's two regiments sent to reinforce the defense of Luding Bridge. The defenders of Luding Bridge were well aware of the political situation after witnessing the fall of the neighboring warlord in Guizhou province and were not willing to sacrifice their own lives for Chiang's potential take- over. Following a divide and conquer tactic, Chiang awarded the local military command of the northern Dadu River region to a smaller Sichuanese warlord, Yang Sen (Êù®Ê£Æ). Yang Sen had allied with the second largest Sichuanese warlord, Liu Xiang. Together they began fighting against the biggest Sichuanese warlord Liu Wenhui. At the time of the Luding Bridge incident, the region was still under Liu Wenhui's control. Liu Wenhui's troops certainly would not take orders from the lesser rival Yang Sen. Although he received military, political, as well as financial support from Chiang Kai-shek, Yang Sen would not sacrifice his own troops by sending them to help Liu Wenhui stop the communists. Both were well aware of Chiang's divide and conquer strategy, and both held their main forces to prepare for Chiang's potential take-over. Knowing the local opium dependent warlord commanders were incapable of stopping the communist forces, Chiang tried to send more capable officers from his own officer corps to advise the local troops. These attempts were politely but unanimously rejected by all local Sichuanese warlords, as they feared Chiang's takeover. =Weaponry= Numerous surviving Chinese Red Army veterans recalled that the weapons used by the local warlords guarding the bridge were far inferior to the weapons used by the Chinese Red Army, suggesting that the incident may have been exaggerated. While the Chinese Red Army soldiers had high morale and were brave, their superior weaponry was probably equally important: *Realizing their dangerous situation, the Chinese Red Army sent their elite troops to seize the bridge. The soldiers were armed with the best of the weapons captured from the National Revolutionary Army, which in turn had German assistance; the assault team members were all armed with submachine guns with an effective range of 300-400 meters while many others were armed with the semi-automatic rifles with an effective range of up to 800 meters. In contrast, the local warlord's troops were armed only with bolt-action rifles, many of which were single-shot rifles so that their firepower was far less dense than the firepower the Chinese Red Army was able to deploy. *Another important factor was the ammunition. The Chinese Red Army used the best ammunition they had captured from the nationalists. These included a significant amount of foreign made ammunition. The bullets used by the provincial warlord's troops were locally manufactured. They were far inferior in quality even when compared to ammunition from other domestic Chinese arms manufacturers, such as Shanghai. In addition, most of the provincial troops' bullets were decades old. When the Red Army troops test fired captured cartridges after their victory, it was discovered that the ammunition used by the local warlord's troops only had a maximum range of around 100 meters. When fired from a rifle at standing position, most of the bullets would drop to the ground at approximately 100 meters. This was not enough to cover even the length of the bridge. The machine guns deployed by the local warlord's troops used the same ammunition, with the same range problems. This discovery was affirmed decades later when surviving members of the local warlords' troops were interviewed abroad . The survivors said that they had neither the density of fire nor the rate of fire needed to suppress the Chinese Red Army. In fact, they were forced to take cover for most of the time during the battle, and rarely fired any shots. The interviewers concluded that the superior density of fire, rate of fire, and accuracy gave the Chinese Red Army the edge. *The technical advantage in weaponry that greatly contributed to the Red Army's success was carefully hidden by the communists for decades, so as to fit their political and propaganda needs . It was not until 1979, during the reform era, that these facts came out. The revised historical information was first presented in a movie, titled 'Da Du He', about the battle. This movie gives a relatively accurate description of the Red Army's advantage in armament. The film shows many Red Army soldiers armed with submachine guns. However, apparently for political propaganda purposes , the movie greatly exaggerated the defenders' firepower. The nationalist troops were all shown armed with semi-automatic repeating rifles instead of the actual bolt-action single-shot rifles commonly used by most of the provincial troops. Orders of battle =Defender: Nationalists= Supreme commander: Chiang Kai-shek, assisted by Liu Wenhui (ÂàòÊñáËæâ) and Yang Sen Êù®Ê£Æ (in name only). The 24th Corps commanded by Liu Wenhui (ÂàòÊñáËæâ) * The 5th Division ** The 4th Brigade commanded by Yuan Guorui (Ë¢ÅÂõΩÁëû), who was in charge of the overall defense of the region but abandoned his post after the initial defeat and fled the scene. *** The 38th Regiment commanded by Li Quanshan (ÊùéÂÖ®Â±±), the actual commander of the battle *** The 10th Regiment *** The 11th Regiment Chiang Kai-shek's forces did not reach the site in time to participate in the battle, though technically these forces were part of the provincial warlords' command. =Attacker: Communists= Supreme commander: Mao Zedong, assisted by Zhu De and Zhou Enlai The right (eastern) column of the 1st Corps commanded by Liu Bocheng and Nie Rongzhen * The 1st Division commanded by Li Jukui (ÊùéËÅöÂ•é) ** The 1st Regiment commanded by Yang Dezhi (Êù®ÂæóÂøó) and political commissar Li Lin (ÈªéÊûó) ** The 2nd Regiment ** The 3rd Regiment The left (western) column of the 1st Corps commanded by Lin Biao * The 2nd Division commanded by Chen Guang (ÈôàÂÖâ) ** The 4th Regiment commanded by Wang Kaixiang (ÁéãÂºÄÊπò) and the political commissar Yang Chengwu (Êù®ÊàêÊ≠¶), who were the actual commanders of the battle. Due to the devastating attrition rate during the Long March, the communist forces were so under-manned that brigade designations did not exist at the time of the incident. Lin Biao's role in the assault Lin Biao has commonly been given credit for direct command of the assault. However, the actual commander was the regimental political commissar Yang Chengwu. Lin Biao and other column commanders remained at their temporary headquarters 160 km away from Luding Bridge, and the task of taking the bridge was given to Lin Biao's vanguard unit, the 4th regiment, as it was 40 km closer to Luding. The regiment was led by commander Wang Kaixiang (ÁéãÂºÄÊπò) and political commissar Yang Chengwu (Êù®ÊàêÊ≠¶). Credit was publicly given to Lin Biao during the Cultural Revolution, in which he was glorified to boost his popularity. Giving him direct credit for jobs accomplished by his subordinates was one of the standard propaganda techniques. During the Cultural Revolution, the actual commander, Yang Chengwu was jailed and persecuted under the direct order of Lin Biao. The actual decision to capture Luding Bridge was made by Mao Zedong himself, at noon on May 26, 1935, with the help of Zhu De. When Mao and Zhu reached Anshunchang ferry, they found just four small boats. After moving a regiment across the river with the ferry, it became apparent that transporting the entire Red Army by ferry would take at least a month. Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist force, commanded by Xue Yue, was closing in fast, so it was decided that the main force would cross the Dadu River at Luding Bridge, 160 km upstream. Mao decided that the Red Army would launch a two-pronged attack on Luding Bridge: *The main force would be on the western bank of Dadu River. This was Lin Biao's 2nd division, spearheaded by the commander Wang Kaixiang's and political commissar Yang Chengwu's 4th regiment, 2nd division, 1st Chinese Red Army corps. *On the eastern bank of the Dadu river would be the 1st division, personally led by the Chinese Red Army chief-of-the-general-staff, Liu Bocheng, and the political commissar of the 1st Corps, Nie Rongzhen. They were spearheaded by commander Yang Dezhi (Êù®ÂæóÂøó)'s and political commissar Li Lin (ÈªéÊûó)'s the 1st regiment, 1st division, 1st Chinese Red Army corps. Mao had also prepared for the worst: if the two forces could not meet at Luding Bridge, Liu Bocheng and Nie Rongzhen would move into western Sichuan and there set up a new base. Lin Biao had little to do with the planning or the direct battle maneuvers of the event. He probably provided logistical implementation for Mao's orders, and then dispatched his units to follow the plan. Lin Biao himself did not reach Luding Bridge until May 30, 1935, well after the end of the battle. Even Liu Bocheng reached Luding Bridge during the night of May 29, 1935, earlier than Lin Biao. However, Lin Biao can be credited with having the audacity, even recklessness, to order his troops to quickly march 160 km in 24 hours through hostile territory, and then, without rest, fight against an enemy of unknown strength. Prelude to the battle On their way to Luding Bridge, the soldiers of the 4th regiment, 2nd division, 1st corps of the Chinese Red Army discovered that on the opposite bank, two regiments of the nationalist reinforcement were on their way to Luding Bridge. The nationalists were faster because they used torches at night, while the communists avoided them in order to move without being detected. When Red Army commander Wang Kaixiang and political commissar Yang Chengwu (Êù®ÊàêÊ≠¶) did finally decide to use torches, they were discovered by their adversaries. Neither of the forces had any radio equipment, and the sound of the raging river made vocal communication impossible. Consequently, the nationalists used bugles for command and control. However, the communists successfully fooled the nationalists into believing that they were on the same side by using the bugle commands of Chiang Kai-shek's ally and designated regional commander, Yang Sen, in reply to the nationalists' signals. In the face of heavy rains, the nationalists stopped their march and camped. The communists pressed on, and reached the bridge first. On the eastern bank, the right column already started their march to the Luding Bridge. The Nationalist 10th regiment, 4th brigade was the closest opposing force to the communists, and began spreading out along the Dadu river. On May 27, 1935, the 2nd regiment of the 1st division of the communist force defeated the nationalist 10th regiment at the Waba (Áì¶Âùù) after several hours of fierce fighting. The next day, after more than a 50 km march, the communist 2nd regiment successfully crushed the remaining units of the nationalist 10th regiment. On May 29, 1935, the communist 2nd regiment engaged the nationalist 11th regiment, and with the help of the communist 3rd regiment, which arrived after the battle began, completely wiped out the nationalist 12th regiment. The communist 2nd and 3rd regiments then proceeded to destroy the brigade headquarters located 25 km away from Luding Bridge. The nationalist commander of the 4th brigade, Yuan Guorui (Ë¢ÅÂõΩÁëû), fled with his surviving staff to the surrounding mountains, from where they were unable to reestablish links with the rest of the nationalist forces after the bridge and the city were both taken by the communists. This left to Li Quanshan (ÊùéÂÖ®Â±±), the regimental commander of the 38th regiment, the task of organizing the defense, which he was unable to accomplish. The battle at the bridge With the main Kuomintang army closing in on the Chinese Red Army, it was decided to send a small volunteer force across the badly damaged bridge. After preparation, the volunteer force led by the company commander, Liao Dazhu (ÂªñÂ§ßÁè†), of the 2nd company, began their assault on the bridge at 4:00 p.m. under a covering barrage of mortars and loud bugler sounds from the south end. While Red Star Over China, which uses the old-style name Tatu River, says there were thirty men in the force, it is now generally accepted that there were only twenty-two soldiers from the company that took part. Red Army sources agree that the members of the force crawled over the bare iron chains of the bridge while under heavy Nationalist machine-gun fire from the opposite side. Most of the assault team did not leave their names behind. Of the 22 assault team members, only four other than the team leader, Liao Dazhu, are known. The four whose names are known are: political commissar of the 2nd company Wang Haiyun (ÁéãÊµ∑‰∫ë), communist party secretary of the 2nd company (ÊùéÂèãÊûó), the communist party secretary of the 3rd company Li Jinshan (ÊùéÈáëÂ±±), and the deputy squad commander of the 4th squad of the 2nd company Liu Zihua (ÂàòÊ¢ìÂçé). According to Red Star Over China, three were hit, fell, and died but the rest came forward, and Red Star Over China suggests that some of the warlord forces admired their foes and were not shooting to kill. The Regimental political commissar, Yang Chengwu, was the commander who led the actual attack. According to his memoirs and the recollections of the survivors of the twenty-two man assault team, there were no fatalities on the bridge itself, but several members of the force were wounded. However, in the ensuing battle to establish a bridgehead, two men were killed, and there were more fatalities in the subsequent battles to defend the bridgehead from the nationalists' counterattacks, which continued until the Red Army reinforcements arrived. At a late stage in the battles, \\"paraffin was thrown on the planking and it began to burn\\". Despite the presence of Red Army forces on both ends of the bridge, the NRA force guarding the bridge and Luding City were driven off it and began to retreat towards the city proper, and some surrendered. According to an account from the website of the late Will Downs: :At last one Red crawled up over the bridge flooring, uncapped a grenade and tossed it with perfect aim into the enemy redoubt. Nationalist officers ordered the rest of the planking torn up. It was already too late. More Reds were crawling into sight. (Kerosene) was thrown on the planking and it began to burn. By then about twenty Reds were moving forward on the hands and knees, tossing grenade after grenade into the enemy machine-gun nest. As a reward, every surviving member of the volunteer team was awarded a fountain-pen, a notebook, a pair of chopsticks, a Zhongshan suit, and an enamel drinking mug, and this was significant at the time in terms of Chinese Red Army's standard: the reward was equivalent of at least half a decade's salary of an ordinary Chinese Red Army soldier. The political commissar of the 4th regiment, Yang Chengwu, also received the same reward. Despite their rewards, none of the survivors lived to see the establishment of the People's Republic. The duty squad commander of the 4th squad of the 2nd company Liu Zihua (ÂàòÊ¢ìÂçé) was killed in January 1949 when liberating Tianjin during the Pingjin Campaign, and the commander of the 2nd company, Liao Dazhu (ÂªñÂ§ßÁè†) was the last to die; he was killed in the battle to liberate Shanghai in May 1949. The commander of the 4th regiment, Wang Kaixiang (ÁéãÂºÄÊπò) did not survive either; after the Long March, the regimental commander was struck with malaria and he accidentally shot himself while under the convulsive effects of the disease. At the Luding Bridge memorial museum, specially built to commemorate the event, only four out of the 22 pillars had names engraved, while the rest were unnamed. For the pillar with the name of the deputy squad commander of the 4th squad of the 2nd company, Liu Zihua (ÂàòÊ¢ìÂçé), his head statue was also engraved. Second battle There were actually two battles fought simultaneously at the site, one at the bridge and the other in Luding City, although due to the needs of political propaganda, the second battle was not publicized until recently. Indeed, it was the second battle that was fought at the suburb of Luding City that was critical in taking the bridge, and the first shot of all was fired in this \\"second\\" battle. Furthermore, it was not the twenty-two members of the assault team from the 2nd company, 4th regiment that first entered Luding City, but the 7th company of the same regiment, with more than five dozen soldiers, who first succeeded in breaking into the city. After reaching the bridge, the commander and the political commissar of the 4th regiment, 2nd division, Chinese Red Army 1st Corps divided the troops into three formations: one assault team to attack the bridge, one team to cross the river and attack them from behind from the suburb of Luding City, and the majority of the force to provide the cover for the assault team. The 7th company was assigned to perform the second task. There was a turn of the Dadu River two km downstream from Luding Bridge, which made it impossible for the defenders of the city to see what was going on at the turn‚Äîbesides, the nationalist defenders never expected that anyone would cross from there. As a result, the 7th company was able to cross the Dadu River with two rafts, and there was not a single enemy soldier at the opposite shore. After the crossing, the sixty soldiers of the 7th company marched upstream toward Luding City on the eastern bank of Dadu River. Around 2:00 p.m. on May 29, 1935, the 7th company was discovered by the sentries of the battalion the nationalist defenders deployed outside the city, and the nationalist sentries hastily fired the first shots of the battle at the Luding Bridge. However, the communist soldiers and the nationalist soldiers were more than 250 meters apart; the bullets of the nationalist soldiers could not reach their targets due to the nationalists' inferior weaponry. The communist soldiers of the 7th company immediately assaulted the enemy position and conquered the nationalist battalion within two hours. Learning that the Red Army had come from behind, the nationalist commanders immediately sent out another battalion for reinforcement, leaving only a token force to guard the bridge. The nationalists were overconfident in their defense of the bridge, not believing that anybody could cross over the bare iron chains under fire. However, the nationalist response simply took too long and it was so disorganized that it was not until the battalion outside the city was decimated that the reinforcement began to move out of the city. One of the reasons for the delay was that the nationalists did not believe that the 120 km to Luding City could be marched in such a short time, and in fact, many of nationalist commanders thought the battle at the suburb of Luding City was a case of misunderstanding and friendly fire amongst nationalist forces. After realizing the attacking force was indeed the enemy and not the reinforcements they hoped for, purportedly only after witnessing defeat of the battalion deployed in the suburb, the nationalist defenders inside the city were reluctant to leave the protection of the city wall and fortifications. Furthermore, the survivors of the battalion deployed outside the city wall greatly exaggerated the strength of the attacking communist force in order to make an excuse for their own failure after escaping back into the city. In order to prevent morale from dropping further, the nationalist commanders decided not to inform their soldiers about the incoming communist force other than for the battalion sent out, a decision they would later regret. The disorganized and slow response also created another disaster for the national defenders inside the city wall: unaware of the newly changed battle plans that were hastily put together, the soldiers of the remaining battalion began to flee, abandoning their posts, because they thought the other battalion deployed to reinforce the already-destroyed battalion in the suburb were in fact escaping. The battalion on its way outside the city wall, in turn, seeing the remaining defenders starting abandoning their posts to flee and hearing the greatly exaggerated enemy from the survivors from the already destroyed battalion, also panicked and fled back into the city, abandoning their assigned mission. Taking advantage of the chaos, soldiers of the 7th company, 4th regiment of the 2nd division, 1st Chinese Red Army Corps successfully fought their way into Luding City at 4:00 p.m., suffering only a dozen fatalities along the way. By this time, the 2nd company of the same regiment on the western end of the bridge had already started their assault from the other side. The survivors of the 7th company fought their way directly toward the bridge, and successfully supported their comrades from the other side on the western bank of the Dadu River. After the assault team had crossed the bridge, and subsequent arrival of the main force of the 4th regiment, the battle ended at 6:00 p.m. with the bridge and the city firmly in the Red Army's hands. The third battle at Luding City Four hours after the communist victory, nationalist reinforcements arrived from the eastern bank of the Dadu River, and together with the survivors of the defenders who were scattered by the Red Army in earlier battles, the nationalists launched their attack from the eastern suburb of Luding City around 10:00 p.m. on the night of May 29, 1935. The 4th regiment of the 2nd division, 1st CRA Corps, expected a fierce battle between them and the nationalists, but instead, the battle was short-lived. The nationalists either surrendered or escaped into the surrounding mountains almost as soon as the battle began, because the 1st regiment, 1st division, 1st CRA Corps on the eastern bank of Dadu River, led by commander Yang Dezhi (Êù®ÂæóÂøó) and political commissar Li Lin (ÈªéÊûó) had also arrived, soon followed by the main force of the 1st division led by the Chinese Red Army Chief of the General Staff, Liu Bocheng, and the political commissar of the 1st corps, Nie Rongzhen, when the battle was supposed to continue. Red Army units on both banks of Dadu River had met at the Luding City area as Mao had planned beforehand. Significance The entire Chinese Red Army had completed its crossing by June 2, 1935, and thus this skirmish may have saved the Red Army from a major defeat. :\\"'Victory was life' said P'eng Teh-huai (Peng Dehuai); 'defeat was certain death'.\\" (Red Star Over China (1971 edition)). The event was incorporated in the elementary school text for patriotic education. The event raised morale for the troops, and was later used as a propaganda tool to highlight the courage of the communists. \\"For their distinguished bravery the heroes of An Jen Ch'ang [the seized ferry boat] and Liu Ting Chiao [the bridge] were awarded the Gold Star, the highest decoration in the Red Army of China.\\" (Red Star Over China'). Controversy =Jung Chang= The British-Chinese writer Jung Chang and her historian husband, Jon Halliday, in their 2005 biography of Mao, Mao: The Unknown Story, write that there was no battle at Luding Bridge. Having interviewed eyewitnesses, including the owner of a nearby shop, they state that the Kuomintang did not sabotage the bridge, or contest the crossing. According to them, the Long March was exaggerated and used as propaganda. Chang & Halliday's is a rare account in denying that there was a battle at Luding Bridge. There are non-Chinese writers who have supported the Communist point- of-view: for example, Harrison E. Salisbury in The Long March: The Untold Story, Dick Wilson in The Long March 1935 : The Epic of Chinese Communism's Survival and Charlotte Salisbury in Long March Diary, though none were eyewitness accounts. Other accounts agree in some ways with Chang's and suggest that propaganda greatly exaggerated the event (see below for more detail). =Zhu De's Account= In Agnes Smedley's biography, The Great Road: The Life and Times of Chu Teh, she mentions that Zhu De as a child had heard about the fate of the Taiping army that had perished there, and had been told: :\\"On dark nights, when there is no moon, you can still hear the spirits of our Taiping dead wailing at the Ta Tu River crossing and over the town where they were slaughtered. They will wail until they are avenged. Then their spirits will rest.\\" (The Great Road, page 27). This account says that the attackers were led by Platoon Commander Ma-Ta-chiu, who was also the first to die. And that overall seventeen men died. (This may include deaths in the unit that had crossed the river by boat and attacked from the other side.) It appears independent of the better-known version given by Edgar Snow. Different English versions of the same Chinese names are used: the river is the 'Ta Tu' and the bridge \\"Lutinchiao\\". =Brzezinski= In a speech given at Stanford University, former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski related the following conversation with Deng Xiaoping: > I even told them we went to Luding Bridge, which was the site of a special, > important heroic battle in which the Red Forces were able to cross the river > under very difficult and treacherous conditions. If they hadn‚Äôt they would > have been wiped out. It was a great feat of arms to have crossed that > bridge. At that point, Chairman Deng smiled and said, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the way > it‚Äôs presented in our propaganda. We needed that to express the fighting > spirit of our forces. In fact, it was a very easy military operation. There > wasn‚Äôt really much to it. The other side were just some troops of the > warlord who were armed with old muskets and it really wasn‚Äôt that much of a > feat, but we felt we had to dramatize it.America and the New Asia(APARC - > Stanford115) =Political propaganda= The incident served as a major morale-raising opportunity for political propaganda. It is incorporated into the textbooks of Chinese elementary schools. In order to magnify the heroism of the Red Army, however, the important second battle fought at the suburb of Luding City on the eastern bank of Dadu River was kept secret, despite the fact it is well documented in the communists' own history archives. Even in the era of reform, movies such as Dadu River (1979), depicting the event, did not touch the subject. It was not until well after 2000, when Wu Qingchang (Âê¥Ê∏ÖÊòå), a veteran of the second battle was interviewed by various Chinese media, that the second battle and its importance, as well as the participants of the 7th company, 4th regiment, 2nd division, 1st Chinese Red Army corps became known to the public. Wu was only 18 when he participated in the battle, and he lost a section of his left index finger in that battle. He was the only survivor in his squadron to reach Shaanxi after the Long March. =Recent additions= Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen, two western writers living in China investigated the matter while retracing the route of the Long March: :With the exception of Yang Chengwu, no source ever suggests that there were no casualties on Luding Bridge. The very first description of the battle, given by Edgar Snow in Red Star Over China in 1937, cited three deaths. The official number, inscribed on the bridge itself, is now four.The Long March, by Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwan, Constable 2006. Sun Shuyun, who was born in China and has made documentaries for the BBC, did her own retracing of the march. At Luding Bridge, a local blacksmith gave her the following account: > Only a squadron was at the other end. It was a rainy day. Their weapons were > old and could only fire a few metres. They were no match for the Red Army. > When they saw the soldiers coming, they panicked and fled‚Äîtheir officers had > long abandoned them. There wasn't really much of a battle. Still, I take my > hat off to the twenty-two soldiers who crawled on the chains. My father and > I did it in the old days when we checked the bridge, but we were inside a > basket. Those men were brave. They crossed very quickly.\\"The Long March, by > Sun Shuyun, HarperCollins 2006. The blacksmith also said that after they had crossed, the Red Army cut through four of the bridge's nine chains, making it unusable for months. This has not been mentioned in other accounts, but Sun Shuyun found another source and discovered that the idea came from Mao. (One of these chains is on display in The Military Museum of the Chinese People‚Äôs Revolution in Beijing.) She also suggests that the Red Army was indeed given an easy passage, but that this was done by local warlords in defiance of Chiang Kai-shek: > It seems that one of the warlords, Liu Wenhui (ÂàòÊñáËæâ), was a key figure... > When [Red Army commander] Zhu De, Liu Bocheng and Nie Rongzhen, his fellow > Sichuanese, sent him money and a letter, asking for safe passage through his > territory, including the Luding Bridge, he happily obliged... 'Chiang gives > my army no ammunition or food, how can we fight tough battles?' he grumbled. > He told his men to put up only half-hearted resistance, and to allow the Red > Army through without much of a fight... Liu kept his contact with the > Communists ... In 1949 he mutinied, taking two other warlords with him over > to the Communists... he was made Minister of Forestry, and then a minister > in the Communist government. (Ibid.) In 2006 the Propaganda Director of Luding government stated: \\"West Point has documented the crossing of Luding Bridge into their textbook.\\" References Sources *\\"Crossing of the Luding Bridge\\" *\\"Account by the late Will Downs *The Long March : The Untold Story by Harrison E.

K-156's western terminus is at U.S. Route 50 Business (US 50 Bus.) and US 83 Bus. in Garden City and the eastern terminus is at Interstate 70 (I-70) and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) northeast of Ellsworth. Along the way, it intersects several major highways including US 50, US 83 and US 400 in Garden City; US 283 in Jetmore; and US 183 near Rozel, and it overlaps its implied parent, US 56, from Larned to east of Great Bend. Before state highways were numbered in Kansas, there were auto trails; the section of K-156 from Larned to Great Bend followed the National Old Trails Road and Old Santa Fe Trail. By 1927, the section of K-156 from Garden City to Great Bend was established as US 50N. K-156 was originally US 156, an intrastate U.S. Highway that was formed in 1957 and ran from Garden City to Great Bend. Between 1966 and 1967, US 156 was extended northeast, along K-45, to I-70 northeast of Ellsworth. On April 1, 1981, US 156 was redesignated K-156. On a May 3, 1996, US 400 was established from the Colorado border to the southern end of the overlap between US 83 and US 50 in Garden City. Its alignment has not been majorly altered since. Route description K-156 begins at US 50 Bus. and US 83 Bus. in Garden City and runs in a generally northeast direction to I-70 and US 40 northeast of Ellsworth. K-156 is signed as east-west its entire length. According to 2018 traffic counts conducted by the Kansas Department of Transportation, on average, traffic varied from 1,080 vehicles per day slightly east of the Finney-Hodgeman county line to 14,500 vehicles per day in Great Bend, slightly west of US 281. The second highest volume of traffic was 11,500 vehicles per day, at the western terminus. The section of K-156 from the western end of the overlap with US 56 to its eastern terminus is included in the National Highway System. K-156 also connects to the National Highway System at its junction with US 50, US 83 and US 400 in Garden City. All but of K-156's alignment is maintained by KDOT. The first from the western terminus eastward is maintained by Garden City. The entire section of K-156 in Larned and the entire section of K-156 through Great Bend are maintained by the cities. =Finney and Hodgeman counties= K-156 overlapped with US 56 and K-96 The route begins in Garden City, on Kansas Avenue at the junction with US 50 Business and US 83 Business (Main Street). The highway continues over Kansas Avenue then turns northeast at a junction with Campus Drive. K-156 then intersects US 50, US 83 and US 400 via a diamond interchange and then continues to follows Kansas Avenue in a northeast direction out of the city. It then curves east at East 6 Mile Road, then intersects Mennonite Road later. From here, the highway continues east for about through rural farmlands before intersecting K-23, passing by Concannon State Fishing Lake and crossing Pawnee River along the way. Here K-156 begins a overlap with K-23. At the end of the overlap K-23 turns south toward Cimarron, as K-156 continues east. K-156 then passes through Kalvesta, then curves to the northeast as it crosses into Hodgeman County. About into the county, K-156 curves back to the east, then crosses Sand Creek later. Roughly further east the highway curves northeast for about then curves back east. The highway continues another then enters Jetmore. In Jetmore it intersects US 283, also known as Main Street. As it exits the city it travels a short distance then curves to the northeast at Bosse. The roadway then curves more to the northeast and passes to the north of Hanston. As it passes by Hanston, K-156 curves east briefly then back northeast as it begins to parallel a Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad track. About later, the highway passes through Gray. It continues past Gray for another then enters into Pawnee County. =Pawnee County= K-156 westbound at its junction with US 183 As it enters the county it continues to parallel a Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad track and the Pawnee River. After about K-156 curves east, passes to the north of Rucker Airport, then enters the southern section of Burdett as Broadway Avenue. It exits the city and continues east, crosses Sawmill Creek, then reaches an intersection with Pawnee Street and 280th Avenue just south of Rozel. About past Rozel it crosses a railroad track. From here the highway continues east through rural farmlands to US 183, crossing the Pawnee River and Cocklebur Creek along the way. It continues east for about before intersecting K-264, passing Fort Larned National Historic Site along the way. K-264 heads south to Larned State Hospital, and K-156 continues east toward Larned. It enters Larned becoming Edwards Street then becomes 14th Street at an intersection with State Street. It continues along 14th Street and soon intersects its implied parent US 56, at Broadway Street. Here the two highways begin to overlap as they continue east. The two routes curve northeast as they exit the city and begin to parallel a Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad track. The highways then cross Ash Creek and enters Barton County later. =Barton and Ellsworth counties= K-156 at junction with K-14 and K-14 Truck As K-156 enters the county it enters the city of Pawnee Rock. It continues northeast and soon passes Dundee. As it exits Dundee it passes to the south of Great Bend Municipal Airport. K-156 and US 56 then curve north and enter Great Bend as South Patton Road. The highways turn east at 10th Street then soon intersects and begins to overlap with K-96. The three roads continue east along 10th Street for to an intersection with US 281 (Main Street), crossing a Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad track along the way. After the three highways cross US 281, they leave Great Bend and later, K-156 splits from US 56 and K-96, heading northeast from there. K-156 passes to the east of Cheyenne Bottoms Reservoir, crosses a Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad, then intersects K-4 at a folded diamond interchange east of Claflin. After an interchange with K-4, the highway enters Ellsworth County later. The highway enters the county and continues northeast before entering Holyrood. As it exits the city, it continues through rural farm lands transitioning into grasslands, and soon intersects K-14 south of Ellsworth. At that junction, K-156 begins carrying a concurrency with K-14 Truck route. The two routes then cross the Smoky Hill River and a Union Pacific Railroad track then enter Ellsworth. Inside the city the two highways curve north at an intersection with 8th Street. The highway passes Memorial Cemetery and soon intersects K-140, known as East 15th Street westbound and Avenue J eastbound. Here, K-14 Truck splits from K-156 and follows K-140 westbound, and K-156 continues north. The highway soon exits the city and continues north for about then curves northeast and crosses Oak Creek. K-156 then reaches a junction with K-111, crossing Spring Creek and East Spring Creek along the way. Past K-111, the landscape around the highway begins to transition to rolling hills covered by grasslands. K-156 then crosses and begins to parallel East Elkhorn Creek. It continues north along the creek for a few miles before reaching its northern terminus at exit 225 of I-70 and US 40 at a diamond interchange. History Before state highways were numbered in Kansas, there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. From the western terminus, K-156 closely follows the former Old Santa Fe Trail, New Santa Fe Trail, National Old Trails Road and Albert Pike Highway. In Jetmore, K-156 intersects the former Star Highway. The highway then overlaps the National Old Trails Road and Old Santa Fe Trail from Larned to Great Bend. East of Claflin, the highway crosses the former Bee Line and Sunflower Trail, then crosses the former Golden Belt in Ellsworth. By 1927, the section of modern K-156 from Garden City to Great Bend was established as US 50N. Between 1944 and 1945, the section of current K-156 between Holyrood to south of Ellsworth was established as a section of K-45. In the early 1950s, towns along what was then the K-45 corridor, connecting Ellsworth, Kansas to the Oklahoma state line at Elkhart, formed the Mid- Continent Diagonal Highway Association to push for a new highway from Springer, New Mexico (on US 85) northeast across the Oklahoma Panhandle, along K-45, and continuing to Manitowoc, Wisconsin on Lake Michigan. By mid-1954, it was being promoted as US 55 between the Great Lakes and the Southwestern United States. The first submissions to the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) to establish the route were made in 1954. The first route considered in northeast Kansas was via US 40 from Ellsworth to Topeka and K-4 and US 59 via Atchison to St. Joseph, Missouri. A revised route adopted in March 1955, due to AASHO objections to the original route, which traveled concurrently with other U.S. highways for over half of its length, followed K-14, K-18, US 24, K-63, K-16, and US 59 via Lincoln and Manhattan. In July, the US 50N Association proposed a plan that would have eliminated US 50N by routing US 55 along most of its length, from Larned east to Baldwin Junction, and then along US 59 to Lawrence and K-10 to Kansas City; towns on US 50N west of Larned, which would have been bypassed, led a successful fight against this. However, in September of that year, the Kansas Highway Commission accepted that plan, taking US 55 east to Kansas City. On June 27, 1956, the AASHO Route Numbering Committee considered this refined plan for US 55, between Springer, New Mexico and Kansas City, Missouri, with a short US 155 along the remaining portion of US 50N from Larned west to Garden City. The committee approved the request, but since the proposed route was more east‚Äìwest than north‚Äìsouth, it changed it to an even number ‚Äì US 56 ‚Äì and the spur to US 156. Between 1962 and 1963, K-45 was extended to US 56 east of Great Bend. Then between 1966 and 1967, US 156 was extended northeast, along K-45, to I-70 northeast of Ellsworth. Until 1965, the section of the highway from Great Bend to Ellsworth County was designated K-45.1965 Kansas State Highway Map In a July 1966 meeting, US 156 was extended north from Ellsworth to the new I-70 that was constructed. In a resolution on October 13, 1967, US 40 between I-70 north of Dorrance to I-70 north of Salina was realigned onto I-70. At this time K-111 was extended north to end at US 156. Between 1975 and 1980, a folded diamond interchange was constructed at the junction with K-4. In a December 17, 1980 resolution, US 50 and US 83 were moved to their current alignment in Garden City, and US 50 Business and US 83 Business became US 156's western terminus. The entirety of US 156, from Garden City to I-70 northeast of Ellsworth, was decommissioned on April 1, 1981, and redesignated as K-156. In a May 3, 1996 resolution, US 400 was established from the Colorado border to K-156, then to the southern end of the overlap between US 83 and US 50 in Garden City. On July 6, 2020, work began on a project to add turning lanes at the interchange with Eighth Street in Ellsworth County. The $1.2 million project was completed by Venture Corporation of Great Bend.

It is located in Italy close to the French border. Monte Viso is well known for its pyramid-like shape and, because it is higher than all its neighbouring peaks by about 500 m, it can be seen from a great distance, including from the Piedmontese plateau, the Langhe, the Theodulpass in the Zermatt ski area and the summits of the Mont Blanc massif. On a very clear day it can be seen from the spires of Milan Cathedral. It has been suggested that Monte Viso could be one of the mountains which inspired the Paramount logo. In Italy it is also known as Il Re di Pietra (The Stone King) because of its prominence within the western Italian Alps landscape. From 29 May 2013, it has become UNESCO's heritage as a cross-border biosphere reserve with France. Monviso seen from Turin, with the Basilica of Superga in the foreground.  Geography  On the northern slopes of Monte Viso are the headwaters of the Po, the longest Italian river, the so-called Pian del Re (2,020 m). The Monviso group is surrounded by the Valle Po, Valle Varaita and, on the French side, the Guil valley. The northern sector of the group, from the Punta Gastaldi to the Col de la Traversette, is located on the French border. = SOIUSA classification = According to the SOIUSA (International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps) the mountain can be classified in the following way: * main part = Western Alps * major sector = South Western Alps * section = Cottian Alps * subsection = southern Cottian Alps * supergroup = catena Aiguillette-Monviso-Granero * group = gruppo del Monviso isa * subgroup = nodo del Monviso * code = I/A-4.I-C.8.a Panoramic view of Monviso with the main peaks  History  Monte Viso is the location of a neolithic jadeite quarry, at an elevation of 2000 to 2400 metres. Its productivity peaked around 5000 BC. The jadeite was used to make cult axes, which are found all over western Europe. One such ceremonial axe head was found as far away as a small hill called Tristia in Western Ireland and is on display in the National Museum of Ireland ‚Äì Archaeology, Dublin. In ancient times the mountain was known as Vesulus.Lewis C. T. and Short C., 1879, Latin Dictionary, p 1982, citing Virgil Aen. X 708 and Pliny 3. 16. 20 ¬ß117. Monte Viso was climbed for the first time on August 30, 1861 by William Mathews, Frederick Jacomb, Jean-Baptiste Croz and Michel Croz. The first woman to summit the mountain was Alessandra Boarelli (1838 ‚Äì 1908) on 16 August 1864.  Monte Viso in literature  Sunset view of Monviso from San Giorgio della Lessinia (VR), over 300km away. Monte Viso is mentioned by various authors, Italian and non-, including Dante, Petrarch, and Chaucer. Dante mentions the mountain in a long simile in Canto XVI of the Inferno as the source of the Montone River: Come quel fiume c'ha proprio cammino prima dal Monte Viso 'nver' levante, da la sinistra costa d'Apennino Chaucer cites the mountain in the prologue to the Clerk's Tale in his Canterbury Tales, in a passage adapted from Petrarch's Latin version of his \\"Tale of Griselda\\": A prohemie, in which discryveth he, Pemond, and of Saluces the contree, And speketh of Appenyn, the hilles hye, That been the boundes of West Lumbardye, And of Mount Vesulus in special, Wher as the Poo out of a welle smal, Taketh his first spryngyng and his cours That eastward ay encresseth in his cours To Emele-ward, to Ferare and Venyse; The which a long thyng were to devyse.

Directed by Terence Fisher, the film stars Peter Cushing, David Peel, Freda Jackson, Yvonne Monlaur, Andr√©e Melly, and Martita Hunt. The film is a sequel to the 1958 film Dracula (also known as Horror of Dracula), though the character of Count Dracula does not appear in the film, and is instead mentioned only twice. Christopher Lee would reprise his role as Dracula in the film Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966). Filming began for The Brides of Dracula on 16 January 1960 at Bray Studios. It was developed under the working titles Dracula 2 and Disciple of Dracula. The finished film premi√®red at the Odeon Marble Arch on 6 July 1960. It was distributed theatrically in 1960 on a double bill with The Leech Woman. Plot A gloomy wood is seen as a voice is heard, narrating: > \\"Transylvania, land of dark forests, dread mountains and black unfathomable > lakes. Still the home of magic and devilry as the nineteenth century draws > to its close. Count Dracula, monarch of all vampires, is dead. But his > disciples live on to spread the cult and corrupt the world. Peter Cushing in The Brides of Dracula Marianne Danielle, a young French schoolteacher en route to take up a position in Transylvania, is abandoned at a village inn by her coach driver. Ignoring the warnings of the locals, she accepts the offer of Baroness Meinster to spend the night at her castle. There, she sees the Baroness's handsome son, who is said to be insane and kept confined. When she sneaks into his quarters to meet him, she is shocked to find him chained by his leg to the wall, and when he tells her that his mother has usurped his rightful lands and pleads for her help, she agrees to steal the key to his chain from the Baroness' bedroom. Discovering this, the Baroness is horrified; yet when her son appears, she obeys him and accompanies him back to his room. Later, Marianne discovers the Baroness' servant Greta, who has also taken care of the Baron since he was a baby, in hysterics: She shows Marianne the Baroness' corpse, and the puncture marks in her throat. Marianne flees into the night upon seeing this, while Greta chastises the Baroness for raising her son on cruelty and cavorting with bad company in the past, which lead to one such being (Dracula) turning him into a vampire and the Baroness having to chain him in his room and feeding him any girls that she lured to the castle. Despite knowing the evil he intends to the village, Greta remains loyal to the Baron. Marianne is later found, exhausted, by Dr. Van Helsing the following morning. She doesn't remember all that has happened, nor is she familiar when asked about the words \\"undead\\" or \\"vampirism.\\" He escorts her to the school where she's to be employed. When Van Helsing reaches the village inn, he finds there is a funeral in progress. A young girl has been found dead in the woods with wounds upon her throat. Van Helsing contacts Father Stepnik, who had requested Van Helsing's presence, having suspicions about the castle and the Baroness. He tries to dissuade the girl's father from burying her, but he doesn't listen, allowing her transformation to be completed. Stepnik and Van Helsing go to the cemetery that night, only to find Greta aiding the newly vampirised village girl to rise from her grave. The men try to stop them, but Greta holds them off and allows the girl to flee. Van Helsing goes to the castle and discovers the Baroness, now risen as a vampire herself, as well as the Baron. After a brief scuffle, the Baron flees on a coach driven by the village girl, abandoning his mother, who is full of self- loathing and guilt over her actions with her son. Knowing that the transformation was Meinster's revenge on his mother for locking him up, Van Helsing takes pity on her and, after sunrise the next morning, kills her with a wooden stake as she slumbers. The Baron, meanwhile, visits Marianne at the school and asks her to marry him. She accepts, much to the good-natured envy of her roommate Gina. However, once Gina is alone, Baron Meinster appears in her room and drains her of her blood. When Van Helsing visits the next day, he finds the school in an uproar over Gina's death. After inspecting Gina's body, Van Helsing orders that her body be placed in a horse stable with people watching it until he returns. That night, Marianne relieves the headmaster's wife of her watch. Initially she is with the stable keeper, Severin, when one of the padlocks on the coffin falls off without unlocking. Severin goes outside to fetch another lock, but is killed by a vampire bat. Inside, the last lock falls from the coffin; the lid is pushed open, and Gina rises, now a vampire. As she approaches Marianne, Gina reveals the whereabouts of the Baron, who is hiding at the old mill. Van Helsing discovers the body of Severin and enters the stable, saving Marianne from being bitten by Gina, who then flees. Van Helsing takes Marianne back to the school to calm her down, and makes it clear to her that the Baron and his vampiric consorts pose a danger to her. Reluctantly, Marianne tells Van Helsing what Gina told her. The vampire hunter goes to the old mill and manages to find the Baron's coffin, but is soon confronted by both of Meinster's brides as well as Greta. Van Helsing wards the brides off with his cross, but Greta, who is still human, wrestles it away from him, only to trip and plummet from the rafters, dying in the fall. The cross falls into the well below the mill and is now out of Van Helsing's reach as the Baron arrives. In the fight that follows, the Baron manages to subdue Van Helsing and bites him, inflicting him with vampirism before leaving. When Van Helsing wakes, he heats a metal tool in a brazier until it is red hot, then cauterises his throat wound and pours holy water on it to purify it, upon which the wounds disappear. Baron Meinster, meanwhile, abducts Marianne from the school and brings her to the mill, intending to vampirise her in front of Van Helsing. As Meinster attempts to hypnotise her to make her compliant to his will, Van Helsing throws the holy water into the Baron's face, which sears him like acid. Meinster kicks over the brazier of hot coals, starting a fire. He runs outside as the brides make their escape. Van Helsing takes Marianne up into the mill, then out via the huge sails, which he moves to form the shadow of a gigantic cross over Meinster, who is killed by his exposure to the symbol. Van Helsing comforts Marianne as the mill burns.

This script was rewritten by Peter Bryan to remove references to Dracula, although Van Helsing was added. The script was then rewritten by Edward Percy. *\\"My own personal involvement in a film like Brides was always 100 percent, not because I felt it to be my duty but because I felt very strongly that the pictures were mine.

The exterior shooting locations were in nearby Black Park and Oakley Court. *The ending was to have originally had the vampires destroyed by a swarm of bats released from Hell by an arcane ritual. This ending was rejected by Peter Cushing, who claimed that Van Helsing would never resort to the use of black magic. The concept of this ending was used three years later for the climax of Hammer's The Kiss of the Vampire. *Christopher Lee was rumoured to have been approached to reprise his role as Dracula for the original version of this film, but this has never been 100% confirmed. *Jimmy Sangster, director Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing were reportedly involved in rewriting the script. * The scene in which the locks drop from Gina's coffin was derived from M.R. James‚Äô story ‚ÄòCount Magnus‚Äô. Reception The Monthly Film Bulletin of the UK wrote: \\"The genuinely eerie atmosphere of traditional Vampire folk-lore continues to elude the cinema. This latest sequel in Hammer's apparently endless series adds little to the Dracula legend other than a youthful, good-looking vampire, and nothing to the familiar Hammer format of inappropriate colour and d√©cor, a vague pretence at period and a serious surface view of the proceedings.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times dismissed the film as \\"but another repetition of the standard tale of the vampire ... There is nothing new or imaginative about it.\\" Variety called the film \\"technically well-made\\" but thought the script \\"adds little to the Dracula legend and follows formula horror gimmicks,\\" and that \\"it would have been considerably more scary if it had been filmed in old-fashioned black and white.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote that Martita Hunt and Freda Jackson were \\"excellent\\" in the film and the direction and photography were \\"first class,\\" but that it was \\"not overly frightening.\\" The Brides of Dracula holds a score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes. The famous Spanish cult film director Jesus Franco credits this film as the one that inspired him to enter the horror film genre in 1961, resulting in his highly acclaimed The Awful Dr. Orloff.

He claimed to have been born on June 19, 1880, near Cavaellon, Haiti; however, he had no documents to verify this and was thus never an officially eligible candidate for this record. The Cuban government sent officials to Haiti to investigate, but found nothing to either prove or disprove the claim. Cuban government medical experts attested that he was at least 119 years old at the time of his death, but the reasons for this determination were never presented.  Early life  Mart√≠nez has papers proving he came to Cuba via steamship in the 1920s from Haiti, but his age at the time was not recorded. Initially he found employment on the family ranch of Cuban president Fidel Castro. He was nicknamed, ‚ÄúEl Avi√≥n‚Äù (the aeroplane), for the speed at which he worked as he helped to construct the original highway across Cuba. He later settled in a small farming community outside Ciego de Avila, where he lived out his days as a perpetual bachelor. He attributed his longevity to a healthy diet of rice and fresh vegetables and the occasional alcoholic beverage. Mr. Mart√≠nez also said the secret to his long life was that, \\"he had never cheated a man or said bad things of other people.\\"  Personal life  He never owned a car. He always walked, rode a bike or took the bus. Hobbies included breeding fighting cocks, growing bananas and dancing. He rarely over ate as food was rationed. He ate mostly starchy cassava and sweet potatoes cooked in pork fat. Only in the last twenty years of his life did he give up smoking. His first doctor's visit was not until he was around 115. The only time he went to the hospital was a few days before he died.  Controversy  No actual record exists of either his birth or his life prior to his immigration to Cuba, making him ineligible for consideration for the title of oldest living person, by the Guinness World Records, held at the time of his death by Elizabeth Bolden (August 15, 1890 - December 11, 2006), an African-American woman aged 116. Nonetheless, Abrogan maintained his claim until his death, and in his later years was the star attraction of the country's recently formed 120-Club, an organization promoting healthy lives for Cuba's senior citizens.

The film was made by the British company Hammer Film Productions and was shot at Bray Studios on sets that were constructed for the proposed Spanish inquisition themed The Rape of Sabena, a film that was shelved when the BBFC objected to the script. While the original story took place in Paris, the location of the film was moved to Madrid to avoid building new Parisian sets. The leading part of the werewolf was Oliver Reed's first starring role in a film and composer Benjamin Frankel's score is notable for its use of twelve-tone serialism, rare in film music.David Huckvale, Hammer Film Scores and the Musical Avant-Garde, Introduction, p.4 It was also the first werewolf film to be shot in color. Upon its initial release, the film was heavily censored in the UK, and a restored print was first aired on the BBC in 1993. While a premiere TV screening of the restored print had been planned to air on BBC2 on 31 October 1992, during the Vault of Horror all-night marathon hosted by Dr. Walpurgis (played by Guy Henry; later named Dr. Terror), the censored version was aired by mistake. Plot The story is set in 18th century Spain. A beggar is imprisoned by a cruel marqu√©s after making inappropriate remarks at the nobleman's wedding feast. The beggar is forgotten, and survives another fifteen years. His sole human contact is with the jailer and his beautiful, mute daughter (Yvonne Romain). The aging, decrepit marqu√©s makes advances on the jailer's daughter while she is cleaning his room. When she refuses him, the marqu√©s has her thrown into the dungeon with the beggar. The beggar, driven mad by his long confinement, rapes her and then dies. The girl is released the next day and sent to \\"entertain\\" the marqu√©s. She kills the old man and flees. She is found in the forest by the kindly gentleman-scholar Don Alfredo Corledo (Clifford Evans) who lives alone with his housekeeper Teresa (Hira Talfrey). The warm and motherly Teresa soon nurses the girl back to health, but she dies after giving birth to a baby on Christmas Day, a fact that Teresa considers \\"unlucky\\", because a child born on Christmas Day would become a werewolf. Alfredo and Teresa raise the boy, whom they name Leon. Leon is cursed by the evil circumstances of his conception and by his Christmas Day birth. An early hunting incident gives him a taste for blood, which he struggles to overcome. Soon, a number of goats are found dead, and a herder's dog is blamed. Thirteen years later, Leon as a young man (Oliver Reed) leaves home to seek work at the Gomez vineyard. The vintner, Don Fernando (Ewen Solon), sets Leon to work in the wine cellar with Jose Amadayo (Martin Matthews) with whom he soon forms a friendship. Leon falls in love with Fernando's daughter, Cristina (Catherine Feller), and becomes despondent at the seeming impossibility of marrying her, and allows Jose to take him to a nearby brothel, where he transforms and kills Vera and Jose, then returning to Alfredo's house. Too late, he learns that Cristina's loving presence prevents his transformation, and he is about to run away with her when he is arrested and jailed on suspicion of murder. He begs to be executed before he changes again, but the mayor does not believe him. His wolf nature rising to the surface, he breaks out of his cell, killing an old soak and the gaoler. Shocked and disgusted by his appearance, the local people summon his adoptive father, who has obtained a silver bullet made from a crucifix blessed by an archbishop. Though torn with grief, Alfredo shoots Leon dead and tearfully covers his body with a cloak.

Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote that some of the color photography was \\"beautiful,\\" adding that \\"for a werewolf yarn this Hammer Production has a Gothic type of narrative that is not uninteresting, if broadly acted.\\" Harrison's Reports graded the film as \\"Good,\\" finding the production values \\"a big asset\\" although the review felt there was \\"not enough action.\\" Variety called it \\"an outstanding entry of the horror picture genre. Although not a particularly frightening or novel story treatment of the perennial shock film topic (werewolves ranking second only to vampires in cinema), it is a first- class effort in other respects.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Even by Hammer standards, this is a singularly repellent job of slaughter-house horror... Surely the time has come when a film like this should be turned over to the alienists for comment; as entertainment its stolid acting, writing, presentation and direction could hardly be more preclusive.\\" Home video release In North America, the film was released on 6 September 2005 along with seven other Hammer horror films on the 4-DVD set The Hammer Horror Series (ASIN: B0009X770O), which is part of MCA-Universal's Franchise Collection. This set was re-released on Blu-ray on 13 September 2016. The film received an individual release with a new 4K scan in April 2020. The new release included a new commentary track by Steven Haberman, a featurette the on the making of the film, make up artist Roy Ashton, \\"Lycanthrophy: The Beast In All Of Us\\" and stills from the film. In other media The film was adapted into a 15-page comic strip for the January 1978 issue of the magazine The House of Hammer (volume 1, # 10, published by General Book Distribution). It was drawn by John Bolton from a script by Steve Moore. The cover of the issue featured a painting by Brian Lewis as Leon in human and werewolf forms.

Belinda Balaski's character \\"Terri Fisher\\" is named for Terence Fisher, who directed The Curse of the Werewolf. The Curse of the Werewolf is also referred to obliquely in John Landis's 1981 werewolf movie An American Werewolf in London when David Kessler (David Naughton) asks Alex Price (Jenny Agutter) \\"Did you ever see The Wolf Man?\\" and Alex replies, \\"Is that the one with Oliver Reed?\\" References External links  * * Category:1961 films Category:English-language films Category:1961 horror films Category:1960s fantasy films Category:British films Category:British fantasy films Category:Werewolves in film Category:Films directed by Terence Fisher Category:Films based on American horror novels Category:Films scored by Benjamin Frankel Category:Hammer Film Productions horror films Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in the 18th century Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films adapted into comics ","title":"The Curse of the Werewolf"},{"id":"2093587","text":"Desperate Measures is a 1998 American action thriller film starring Michael Keaton, Andy Garc√≠a, Marcia Gay Harden and Brian Cox, directed by Barbet Schroeder. It was filmed in both the San Francisco Bay Area and downtown Pittsburgh with such landmarks as the BNY Mellon Center, the Allegheny County Courthousehttp://www.pghfilm.org/show_films.jsp?restrictids=Film_Name&restrictvalues;=Desperate+Measures and the Oakland Bay Bridge. The film was released on January 30, 1998 and was a critical and financial failure. However, Andy Garc√≠a won an ALMA Award for \\"Outstanding Actor in a Feature Film in a Crossover Role\\". Plot San Francisco police officer Frank Conner is in a frantic search for a compatible bone marrow donor for his leukemia-stricken son, Matt. In desperation, he breaks into FBI headquarters and finds a perfect match. Unfortunately, it is Peter McCabe, a sociopath who is serving life in prison for several murders. During his time in prison, the brutal, cunning McCabe has attempted escape and killed several guards and fellow prisoners, and must be kept in multiple restraints when out of his isolation cell. McCabe initially shows little interest in helping Conner, but later finds an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage and devises a plot to escape. Biding his time, McCabe plays chess against a computer, easily defeating the program, and expresses the need for a challenge akin to Garry Kasparov or Deep Blue. Meanwhile, Conner, along with police captain Cassidy and Matt's physician, Dr. Hawkins, prepare for McCabe to be transferred to the hospital for the transplant. At the hospital, McCabe is given a sedative. With the aid of a counteracting drug he had obtained from a fellow inmate, McCabe slips out of his restraints, attacks the guards and attempts to escape. Conner and a fellow officer corner him, but McCabe holds a scalpel to Hawkins' throat, prompting Conner to drop his gun. The other officer gets the drop on McCabe, but Hawkins warns the police that if he dies, his bone marrow becomes useless. Conner stands in the way of the other officer; McCabe takes his gun and shoots the officer. After hearing what happened, Cassidy immediately orders Conner off the case and removed from the scene. Conner breaks free to search the hospital for McCabe on his own. McCabe causes an explosion with propane tanks, seizes control of the hospital's adjacent wing, holds guards hostage and orders a lockdown of the building. Conner and Hawkins make their way to McCabe and convince him to let them inside so that Hawkins can attend to Matt. As McCabe watches Conner on the security cameras, he realizes that his nemesis is a truly devoted father, and develops a grudging respect for him. Conner intervenes when McCabe is about to ambush Cassidy and his SWAT team with a set of tanks of cyclopropane. Cassidy is furious that Conner continues to aid an escaped convict, while McCabe is angry that Conner foiled his plan. He kidnaps Matt and descends to the sub-levels of the building. Matt tries to wound McCabe to give his father a better chance; impressed, McCabe spares Matt and leaves him at the hospital for Conner to find. McCabe then escapes into San Francisco, where he steals a car. Conner chases McCabe to a bridge, still needing him captured alive. Cassidy and his men arrive in a helicopter and a sniper opens fire. Conner again shields McCabe and is wounded in the arm. McCabe attempts to flee, but Conner is determined not to let him go. Conner wounds McCabe, sending him off the bridge and into the bay. Conner then dives in and saves him. Back in the hospital, a wounded McCabe agrees to the transplant, which saves Matt's life. Even though his career is clearly over, Conner is overjoyed that his son will live. McCabe is informed by a guard that the surgery went well. As the bed reclines upwards and McCabe looks at the guard menacingly, the guard suddenly realizes that his gun is gone. McCabe holds it over the guard and asks, \\"What kind of car do you have?\\".

It is similar to olefin metathesis, except that olefin metathesis cleaves and recreates a carbon- carbon double bond, but alkane metathesis operates on a carbon-carbon single bond. Examples and catalysts Alkane metathesis is catalyzed by metal- containing compounds or complexes. One such class of catalyst systems, discovered and developed by the group of Jean-Marie Basset, comprises tantalum hydride supported on silica (SiO2)TaH at temperatures of 25¬∞C to 200¬∞C. These systems catalyze the conversion of ethane to give methane, propane and traces of butane. Cross metathesis can also take place, for example methane and propane can react to give two molecules of ethane. Ethane reacts with toluene to give ethylbenzene and xylene. The reaction involves metallocyclobutane intermediates just as in olefin metathesis. Dual-catalyst systems have also been developed which are effective for the metathesis of higher alkanes. These systems are based on the tandem operation of two catalysts, one for transfer- dehydrogenation and one for olefin metathesis. A heterogeneous system consisting of Pt on alumina mixed with W oxide on silica was reported by Burnett and Hughes. Systems based on pincer-iridium dehydrogenation catalysts and either \\"Schrock-type\\" Mo-based olefin metathesis catalysts have been reported by Brookhart and Goldman. Because the iridium-based catalysts show selectivity for the termini of n-alkanes, these systems have the unique ability to effect alkane metathesis with some selectivity for product molecular weight. Thus for example n-hexane can be converted to ethane and n-decane as the major products. Numerous applications for alkane metathesis involving petrochemicals and fuels can be envisaged. For example, the conversion of n-hexane to n-decane and ethane has been proposed for the purpose of improving the overall yield of diesel grade n-alkane (C9H20 to C19H40) from Fischer-Tropsch reactors, which convert syngas to a broad range of n-alkanes. Scott, Goldman and Brookhart have reported the metathesis of cycloalkanes with the pincer-Ir/Mo system. Cyclooctane (cyclo-C8H16), for example is converted to a mixture of cyclohexadecane (cyclo-C16H32) and higher rings as well as polymers.

In the Renaissance Romanians begin to be mentioned in journey and political reports, providing information about the name they give themselves, about their language, customs and the countries they inhabit. The self-designation of Romanians as Romans is mentioned in some 30 scholarly works as early as the 16th century by mainly Italian humanists travelling in Transylvania, Moldavia and Walachia. Ioan-Aurel Pop, Italian Authors and the Romanian Identity in the 16th Century, Revue Roumaine d'Histoire, XXXIX, 1-4, p. 39-49, Bucarest, 2000 Thus, Tranquillo Andronico writes in 1534 that Romanians (Valachi) \\"now call themselves Romans\\".\\"Connubia iunxit cum provincialibus, ut hoc vinculo unam gentem ex duabus faceret, brevi quasi in unum corpus coaluerunt et nunc se Romanos vocant, sed nihil Romani habent praeter linguam et ipsam quidem vehementer depravatam et aliquot barbaricis idiomatibus permixtam.\\" in Magyar T√∂rt√©nelmi T√°r ‚Äì 4. sorozat 4. k√∂tet ‚Äì 1903. - REAL-J; also see Endre Veress, Fontes rerum transylvanicarum: Erd√©lyi t√∂rt√©nelmi forr√°sok, T√∂rt√©nettudom√°nyi Int√©zet, Magyar Tudom√°nyos Akad√©mia, Budapest, 1914, Vol. IV, S. 204 and also Maria Holban, CƒÉlƒÉtori strƒÉini √Æn »öƒÉrile Rom√¢ne, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ, Bucure»ôti, 1968, vol.1, p. 247 and also in G√°bor Alm√°si, I Valacchi visti dagli Italiani e il concetto di Barbaro nel Rinascimento, Storia della Storiografia, 52 (2007): 049-066 In 1532, Francesco della Valle accompanying Governor Aloisio Gritti to Transylvania, Walachia and Moldavia notes that Romanians preserved the name of the Romans (Romani) and \\"they call themselves in their language Romanians (Romei)\\". He even cites the sentence \\"Sti Rominest ?\\" (\\"do you speak Romanian ?\\" for originally Romanian \\"»ôtii rom√¢ne»ôte ?\\") Further, this author reports what he could learn from local orthodox monks, that \\"in the present they call themselves Romanians (Romei)\\" .\\"...si dimandano in lingua loro Romei...se alcuno dimanda se sano parlare in la lingua valacca, dicono a questo in questo modo: Sti Rominest ?

Bucure≈üti 1993, p. 39 , the Polish Humanist Stanislaus Orichovius notes as late as 1554 that \\"these left behind Dacians in their own language are called Romini, after the Romans, and Walachi in Polish, after the Italians\\",\\"hos Dacos reliquerunt qui eorum lingua Romini ab Romanis, nostra Walachi, ab Italis appellantur\\" in Stanislaus Orichovius, Annales polonici ab excessu Sigismundi, 1643, p.119 . Another humanist, who took up residence in Transylvania as a bishop of Alba Iulia, the Dalmatian Antonius Verantio, who later would become cardinal and viceroy of Habsburg Hungary, also states in 1570 that \\"the Wallachians call themselves Romans\\" and provides an example: \\"When they ask somebody whether they can speak Wallachian, they say: do you speak Roman? and [when they ask] whether one is Wallachian they say: are you Roman?\\" \\"...Valacchi, qui se Romanos nominant...\\" \\"Gens quae ear terras (Transsylvaniam, Moldaviam et Transalpinam) nostra aetate incolit, Valacchi sunt, eaque a Romania ducit originem, tametsi nomine longe alieno...\\" and \\"Interrogantes quempiam an sciret Valacchice: scisne, inquunt, Romane? et an Valachus esset: num Romanus sit? quaerunt\\" De situ Transsylvaniae, Moldaviae et Transaplinae, in Monumenta Hungariae Historica, Scriptores; II, Pest, 1857, p. 120, 134-135 cited in Adolf Armbruster: Romanitatea rom√¢nilor.

The geographer Anton Friedrich B√ºsching writes in 1754 that \\"the Wallachians, who are remnant and progeny of the old Roman colonies thus call themselves Romanians, which means Romans\\" \\"Walachen, welche ein √úberbleibsel und eine Nachkommenheit der alten R√∂mischen Colonien sind, daher sie sich Romunius oder Rumuin d.h.

The Hungarian writer Andr√°s Dugonics in 1801 states: \\"But those Romans who remained in Dacia mixed their Roman language with the language of the Sarmatians [of the Slavs] and that of the Dacians. Thus a special language was formed, the Wallachian language (ol√°h nyelv), which is nothing else but a mixture of the Latin language with the Slavic and Dacian language (d√°kus), and they themselves are today called the Romans (r√≥maiak), ie rumun\\" \\"Kik pedig a' R√≥maiak k√∂z√ºl D√°ci√°ban ineg-maradtak ; a' R√≥mai nyelvet (melyen ok besz√©ll√∂ttenek) a' Szarmat√°k' nyelvv√©vel (mely a' T√≥t nyelvvel egy vala) azut√°n a' D√°kusok√©val-is √∂szsze-vegy√≠tv√©n, egy k√ºl√∂n√∂s Ol√°h-nyelvet szerzettek, mely nem egy√©b, hanem De√°k, Tot, √©s D√°kus-nyelvb≈ël √∂szsze-habartt, √©s f√∂l-ereszt√∂tt sz√ºlem√©ny. √ìk magokat most-is R√≥maiaknak nevezik (Rumun).'\\"A magyaroknak uradalmaik, mint a r√©gi, mind a mostani √ºd√∂kben, Pesten √©s Pozsonyban, 1801, p. 154 the English author John Paget, in 1839, in his book, \\"Hungary and Transylvania\\" writes: \\"\\"the Wallack of the present day calls himself \\"Rumunyi\\" and retains a traditional pride of ancestry, in spite of his present degradation.\\"Hungary and Transylvania, 1839, p. 186.

For centuries, both spelling forms are interchangeably used, sometimes in the same phrase.\\"am scris aceste sfente c«ér»õi de √ÆnvƒÉ»õƒÉturi, s«é fie popilor rum√¢nesti... s«é √Æn»õeleag«é to»õi oamenii cine-s rum√¢ni cre»ôtini\\" \\"√éntrebare cre»ôtineasc«é\\" (1559), Bibliografia rom√¢neasc«é veche, IV, 1944, p. 6. \\"...cƒÉ vƒÉzum cum toate limbile au »ôi √Ænfluresc √Æntru cuvintele sl«évite a lui Dumnezeu numai noi rom√¢nii pre limbƒÉ nu avem.

In the 17th century the term \\"Romanian\\" also appears as Rumun (Johann Tr√∂ster), Rumuny (Paul Kov√°cs de Lisznyai), Rumuin (Laurentius Toppeltinus), and Rumen (Johannes Lucius and Martin Szentiv√°nyi). In the Middle Ages the ethno-linguistical designation rum√¢n/rom√¢n also denoted common people. During the 17th century, as serfdom becomes a widespread institution, common people increasingly turns into bondsman. In a process of semantic differentiation in 17th-18th centuries the form rum√¢n, presumably usual among lower classes, got merely the meaning of bondsman, while the form \\"rom√¢n\\" kept an ethno-linguistic meaning.Stelian Brezeanu, Romanitatea Oriental«é √Æn Evul Mediu, Editura All Educational, Bucure»ôti, 1999, p. 229-246 After the abolition of the serfage by Prince Constantine Mavrocordato in 1746, the form \\"rum√¢n\\" gradually disappears and the spelling definitively stabilises to the form \\"rom√¢n\\", \\"rom√¢nesc\\".In his well-known literary testament IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu writes: \\"Urma»ôilor mei VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti!/Las vouƒÉ mo»ôtenire:/Cre»ôterea limbei rom√¢ne»ôti/»ò-a patriei cinstire.\\" In the \\"Istoria faptelor lui Mavroghene-VodƒÉ »ôi a rƒÉzmeri»õei din timpul lui pe la 1790\\" a Pitar Hristache writes: \\"√éncep dupƒÉ-a mea ideie/Cu vreo c√¢teva condeie/Povestea mavrogheneascƒÉ/Dela »öara Rom√¢neascƒÉ. Etymology of Romania (Rom√¢nia) Neac»ôu's Letter, the oldest surviving document written in Romanian has the oldest appearance of the word \\"Rumanian\\" Greek: Rumunia) published in Geograficon tis Rumunias, Leipzig, 1816. Author: Dimitrie Daniil Philippide Map of Rumania from 1855. Author: Cezar Bolliac The earliest preserved document written in the Romanian language is a 1521 letter that notifies the mayor of Bra»ôov about an imminent attack by the Turks. This document, known as Neac»ôu's Letter, is also notable for having the first occurrence of \\"Romanian\\" in a Romanian text, Wallachia being called here the Romanian Land--»öeara Rum√¢neascƒÉ (»öeara < Latin Terra = land). As in the case of the ethnonym \\"rom√¢n/rum√¢n\\", Romanian documents use both forms, »öara Rom√¢neascƒÉ and »öara Rum√¢neascƒÉ, for the country name. A common Romanian area called The Romanian Land and embracing Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania is mentioned by the chronicler Miron Costin in the 17th century.A»ôa »ôi neamul ac√©sta, de carele scriem, al »õƒÉr√¢lor acestora, numele vechi≈≠ »ôi mai dirept≈≠ ieste rum√¢n, adecƒÉ r√¢mlean, de la Roma.

In De neamul moldovenilor In the first half of the 18th century the erudite prince Dimitrie Cantemir systematically used the name »öara Rom√¢neascƒÉ for designating all three Principalities inhabited by Romanians.\\"Hronicon a toatƒÉ »öara Rom√¢neascƒÉ (care apoi s-u √ÆmpƒÉr»õit √Æn Moldova, MunteniascƒÉ »ôi Ardealul) ...\\", D. Cantemir, Hronicul vechimei rom√¢no-moldo-vlahilor, in Operele Principelui Dimitrie Cantemir, Academia Rom√¢nƒÉ, Bucuresti, 1901, p. 180. Actually, as argued by Ioan-Aurel Pop, the name \\"Romania\\" isn't but a version of the name \\"Romanian Land\\", just as in England - Anglia, or Scotland - Scotia. Ioan-Aurel Pop, Istoria »ôi semnifica»õia numelor de rom√¢n/valah »ôi Rom√¢nia/Valahia, reception speech at the Romanian Academy, delivered on 29 Mai 2013 in public session, Bucharest, 2013, p.20. See also I.-A. Pop, \\"Kleine Geschichte der Ethnonyme Rum√§ne (Rum√§nien) und Walache (Walachei),\\" I-II, Transylvanian Review, vol. XIII, no. 2 (Summer 2014): 68-86 and no. 3 (Autumn 2014): 81-87. The etymology of \\"Rom√¢nia\\" didn't follow the Romanian pattern of word formation for country names, which usually adds the suffix \\"-ia\\" to the ethnonym by keeping its accent, like in \\"grec\\" ‚Üí \\"Grecia\\", \\"Bulgar\\" ‚Üí \\"Bulgaria\\", \\"rus ‚Üí \\"Rusia\\", etc. Since it is a self-designation, the word \\"Rom√¢nia\\" has an older history, coming from \\"rom√¢nie\\" which in turn resulted as a derivation of the word \\"rom√¢n\\" by adding the suffix \\"-ie\\" with an accented last syllable, like in \\"\\"mo»ô ‚Üí mo»ôie\\", \\"domn\\" ‚Üí \\"domnie\\" or \\"boier\\" ‚Üí \\"boierie\\" (lord ‚Üí lordship). Initially, \\"rom√¢nie\\" may indeed have meant \\"Romanianship\\" (just like \\"rum√¢nie\\" meant \\"serfdom\\" before disappearing), as suggested by Nicolae Iorga's theory of the \\"Romaniae\\", i.e. self-organized communities of romanophone peasants all across medieval Europe. \\"Et, en m√™me temps, les populations romanes, en Gaule aussi bien qu'√† Rome, dans l'ancienne capitale de m√™me que sur la rive de l'Adriatique, dans les vall√©es des Balcans, sur le Danube et dans les Carpathes, en Sardaigne, r√©duites √† se prot√©ger et √† s'organiser elles-m√™mes, s'√©rig√®rent en d√©mocraties populaires, ayant l'orgueil de repr√©senter, devant un ma√Ætre √©tabli dans leur voisinage ou sur leur territoire m√™me, des Romaniae, des pays de romanit√© nationale, dont le souvenir s'est perp√©tu√© dans les noms de la Romagne italienne, de m√™me que dans celni des Roumanches alpins, dans celui des Romani, des Roumains de la p√©ninsule balcanique et du territoire de l'ancienne Dacie.\\" p.36 and \\"Quand, sous Justinien, la Rome d'Orient marcha de nouveau √† la conqu√™te de sa fronti√®re danubienne, elle trouva ces d√©mocraties paysannes d√©j√† organis√©es en œáœéœÅŒ±Œπ, en \\"terres\\", dont les Roumains ‚Äî successeurs de ces Romani dont ils gard√®rent le nom et la langue ‚Äî firent »õeri (singulier »õara)\\", p.47 in La \\"Romania\\" danubienne et les barbares au Vie si√®cle,' Revue Belge de philologie et d'histoire, III (1924), 35-51 The name \\"Rom√¢nia\\" as common homeland of the Romanians is documented in the early 19th century.The first known mention of the term \\"Romania\\" in its modern denotation dates from 1816, as the Greek scholar Dimitrie Daniel Philippide published in Leipzig his work \\"The History of Romania\\", followed by \\"The Geography of Romania\\". On the tombstone of Gheorghe LazƒÉr in Avrig (built in 1823) there is the inscription: \\"Precum Hristos pe LazƒÉr din mor»õi a √Ænviat/A»ôa tu Rom√¢nia din somn ai de»ôteptat.\\" The name \\"Romania\\" (Rom√¢nia) was first brought to Paris by young Romanian intellectuals in the 1840s, where it was spelled \\"Roumanie\\" in order to differentiate Romanians (fr.: Roumains) from Romans (fr.: Romains). The French spelling version (Roumanie) spread then over many countries, such as Britain, Spain, Italy, Germany. In English, the name of the country was originally borrowed from French \\"Roumania\\" (<\\"Roumanie\\"), then evolved into \\"Rumania\\", but was eventually replaced after World War II by the name used officially: \\"Romania\\". With a few exceptions such as English and Hungarian (\\"Rom√°nia\\"), in most languages, the \\"u\\" form is still used (German and Swedish: Rum√§nien; Bulgarian: –†—É–º—ä–Ω–∏—è; Serbian: –†—É–º—É–Ω–∏—ò–∞ / Rumunija, Polish: Rumunia, etc.). In Portuguese, to distinguish them from the Romans, the Romanians are called romenos and their country Rom√©nia. The e reflects the distinct quality of the Romanian √¢, even though it's not very similar. Spelling reforms After the Communist seizure of power, a spelling reform simplified the Romanian alphabet substituting √Æ for √¢. The name of the country became officially Republica PopularƒÉ Rom√ÆnƒÉ. Soon an exception was made to allow √¢ for rom√¢n and its derivations, while √Æ kept used elsewhere. Since, and even after the post-Communist spelling reform, rom√¢n is spelled with a. Other uses of Romania and other derivatives of Romanus * Since 7th century, name for region surrounding Ravenna (Romagna in Italian) where the Byzantines kept off the Germanic rulers. * The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire was known during the Middle Ages as the Roman Empire, or more commonly Romania (Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ± in Greek; compare with the modern name Œ°ŒøœÖŒºŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ± \\"Rouman√≠a\\" for Romania). In Western Europe for political and linguistic reasons the Empire came to be referred to as the Greek Empire and eventually the Byzantine Empire. The Greek-speaking Ottoman Christians continued to refer to themselves as Romans (Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ \\"Romaioi\\", also the origin of the first name Romeo) long after being absorbed by the Ottoman Empire, only adopting the Greek identity in the 19th century. In the Arabic and Ottoman Turkish languages, Romania came to mean further Eastward regions of the empire, like R√ªm and Rumelia in Asia. Rumi was also an Arabic word for Christian. * It has been an alternative name for the Latin Empire, centred on Byzantium, set up by Roman Catholic Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade with the intention of replacing the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire with a Roman Catholic empire. * In Romance linguistics it designates all Romance linguistic areas. * The word Romanus is also kept elsewhere in other parts of the Roman Empire in the name of the Romansh language of Switzerland. * In the Balkans there are Romanic people that have an ethnonym derived from \\"Romanus\\", including Aromanians (arm√¢ni, arum√¢ni or rƒÉmƒÉni) and Istro-Romanians (rum√¢ri). The Megleno-Romanians originally used the form rƒÉm√¢ni, but it was lost by the 19th century and used the word Vla»ôi borrowed from Bulgarian.

It is named after the trebuchet, a medieval siege engine. The name was inspired by a puzzle question that Connare heard at Microsoft headquarters: \\"Can you make a trebuchet that could launch a person from main campus to the new consumer campus about a mile away? Mathematically, is it possible and how?\\" Connare \\"thought that would be a great name for a font that launches words across the Internet\\". Trebuchet MS was the font used for the window titles in the Windows XP default theme, succeeding MS Sans Serif and Tahoma. Released free of charge by Microsoft as part of their core fonts for the Web package, it remains one of the most popular body text fonts on webpages. Distinguishing characteristics Connare said in 2011 that \\"inspiration came from many sources such as the motorway signage in America and sans serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk and Alternate Gothic.\\" Writing on Typophile in 2005 and also in his 1997 article on Trebuchet, he also noted that a goal was to provide a typeface that worked well onscreen while providing a contrast in texture to Verdana. Features of Trebuchet include: * The splayed edges of the uppercase \\"M\\" which form a 10¬∞ angle with a vertical line, reminiscent of a tighter version of Futura. * The shape of the tail of the uppercase \\"Q\\". * The bar of the capital \\"A\\" is low. * The shortened tails of the lowercase \\"e\\" and the numerals \\"6\\" and \\"9\\". * The hybrid open and looped tail of the lowercase \\"g\\". * The rounded dots above and the shapes of the lowercase \\"i\\" and \\"j\\". * The curved tail beneath the lowercase \\"l\\". * The dollar sign symbol \\"$\\", in which the vertical strike only appears above the top and below the bottom curves of the S. * The ampersand \\"&\\" in the form of an \\"Et\\" ligature. * The exclamation point \\"!\\", whose dot is large and round. * Italic fonts incorporate italic type characteristics instead of just tilting roman glyphs, making it the first sans serif font family from Microsoft to use true italic features. * The bold version also has some distinctive features: pointed rather than square-cut tails on lowercase \\"a\\" and \\"l\\", and slant-cut rather than square-cut ascenders. * The en dash and hyphen are essentially indistinguishable. * The Greek letter xi \\"Œû\\" has a vertical crossbar, reminiscent of its Phoenician root glyph samekh. Availability Microsoft refers to Trebuchet MS as \\"a good web design font\\", being one of their \\"Core fonts for the Web\\". Trebuchet MS is included with several products, including the Windows operating system, components of the Office productivity suite, and Internet Explorer. In some versions of the font (those shipped with Windows 2000 and early versions of Internet Explorer), the opening quotation mark character was flipped vertically like so, ‚Äü. This error was fixed in later versions. Trebuchet MS has been released with the Microsoft Windows operating system since Microsoft Windows 2000. The typeface has been released with Internet Explorer since version 4.0 and Microsoft Word since Word 2000. It is also included with macOS, iOS and Chrome OS. The Trebuchet 2010 font family was introduced by Ascender Corp in July 2010 as part of the Ascender 2010 Font Pack. In addition to extensive OpenType typographic feature support, the family was extended with new black and black italic fonts. The new weights and OpenType features were developed by Ascender‚Äôs Steve Matteson and Terrance Weinzierl. Trebuchet Pro In 2010 Ascender and Microsoft released an expanded version of Trebuchet for commercial sale. This included additional features such as small caps, stylistic alternates and text figures, as well as an additional Black weight with italic.

It was the first multiplatform Madden game to be fully 3D (and the second one following the N64-exclusive Madden Football 64). The game's commentary was done by John Madden and Pat Summerall. The American versions feature John Madden himself on the cover, while the European versions used Garrison Hearst instead. The game was the top selling PlayStation sports video game in 1998 in North America, having sold 1.1 million copies on the PlayStation.  Gameplay  = Features = * The game was the first to feature the concept of covering the ball while running and the chop block and \\"clothesline\\" techniques which were later scrapped and moved to players simply tackling ball-carriers. Although players' heights now resemble their real life counterparts, all players share the same sized physiques. The game also had twelve historic teams including the 1978 Steelers and 1985 Bears and secret teams such as the Tiburon sports team and NFL All-Star teams from each decade. The Cleveland Browns, who were a year away from rejoining the league, can be accessed for exhibition games via the password \\"WELCOMEBACK\\". * This was the first Madden game to feature Franchise Mode, in which the user could control their team for 15 seasons, complete with realistic NFL type schedules consisting of alternating inter-conference divisional opponents. The user was able to trade, sign/release and draft players. There were a couple of drawbacks to this feature, the first being was that only one player/team owner was allowed to participate during the same franchised season, and the second prohibited any created players from being added to specific teams or to the free agent pool. * The game was one of the few PlayStation games to support two multi-taps allowing for up to eight players to play simultaneously. = Free agents = * Created Players from NCAA Football '99 can be put in the game as free agents and put on other teams in Quick Game Mode. * Darnell Autry of Northwestern Wildcats football fame is in the game as a free agent. * Gary Zimmerman appears as a free agent despite being retired at the beginning of the season. * Pepper Johnson is listed incorrectly as a 24-year-old twelve-year veteran, which would mean he would have been a 12-year-old rookie. = Rankings = The Denver Broncos had the best team overall in the game with a score of 92.

It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs). In October 2005, the Surface Radiation Research Branch of the ARL was merged with five other NOAA labs to form the Earth System Research Laboratory. The Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) studies processes and develops models relating to climate and air quality, including the transport, dispersion, transformation and removal of pollutants from the ambient atmosphere. The emphasis of the ARL's work is on data interpretation, technology development and transfer. The specific goal of ARL research is to improve and eventually to institutionalize prediction of trends, dispersion of air pollutant plumes, air quality, atmospheric deposition, and related variables. ARL provides scientific and technical advice to elements of NOAA and other Government agencies on atmospheric science, environmental problems, emergency assistance (Homeland Security), and climate change. ARL's stated goal is to improve the Nation's ability to protect human and ecosystem health while also maintaining a vibrant economy. Organization ARL's headquarters is located in College Park, Maryland (formerly in Silver Spring, Maryland) and the current Acting Director is Dr. Ariel Stein. The headquarters group develops products to augment the operational product suites of the NOAA service-oriented line offices (particularly the National Weather Service). This includes the research and development of improved dispersion models for emergency response and air quality forecast models. The headquarters group also improves the understanding of climate variability and trends, the exchange of pollutants between the air and land, and the sources of mercury that influence sensitive ecosystems. As depicted in the adjacent organization diagram, the ARL operates with four research divisions in Idaho Falls, Idaho; North Las Vegas, Nevada; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina: * The Atmospheric Turbulence & Diffusion Division (ATDD) is located in Oak Ridge, TN. ATDD concentrates on air quality and climate-related research directed toward issues of national and global importance. In their air quality research, ATDD develops better methods for predicting transport, dispersion, and air-surface exchange of air pollutants; applies these methods to increasingly realistic situations including nighttime cases, complex terrain, and non-uniform surfaces; and tests these methods against data to determine the confidence limits and uncertainties which apply. ATDD's climate- related research includes reference-grade measurement of climate change and related physical and chemical processes. * The Field Research Division (FRD) is located in Idaho Falls, ID. FRD conducts experiments to better understand atmospheric transport and dispersion, improves both the theory and models of air-surface exchange processes, and develops new technologies and instrumentation to carry out its mission. In a cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy, the Division supports the Idaho National Laboratory with meteorological forecasts and emergency response capabilities. * The Special Operations & Research Division (SORD) is located in Las Vegas, NV. SORD conducts basic and applied research in atmospheric dispersion, particle re- suspension, particle deposition, and the effects of airborne particles on atmospheric opacity. The Division supports issues of mutual interest to NOAA and the Department of Energy that relate to the Nevada Test Site, its atmospheric environment, and its emergency preparedness and emergency response activities. * The Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division (ASMD) develops and evaluates predictive atmospheric models on all spatial and temporal scales for forecasting air quality and for assessing changes in air quality and air pollutant exposures. It was established in 1955 to collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its predecessor agencies in developing advanced air quality models. The ASMD is currently located in College Park, Maryland (formerly in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina).

There are three main groups: * Geophagus sensu stricto are mostly relatively peaceful, often have long fin extensions and are native to the Amazon, Orinoco and Parna√≠ba basins, as well as rivers of the Guianas. This group can be divided into two subgroups: The first is the G. surinamensis complex, which includes most species (fish in the aquarium trade often are identified as G. surinamensis itself, but they are typically other members of this complex.) The second subgroup contains G. argyrostictus, G. gottwaldi, G. grammepareius, G. harreri and G. taeniopareius, which are somewhat less peaceful and can be separated from the G. surinamensis complex by their dark stripe below the eye (however, this feature is shared with the next group). * G. brasiliensis complex (including G. diamantinensis, G. iporangensis, G. itapicuruensis, G. multiocellus, G. obscurus, G. rufomarginatus and G. santosi) are more robust and aggressive species found in river basins of eastern and southeastern Brazil, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina. * G. steindachneri complex (including G. crassilabris and G. pellegrini and undescribed species entering the aquarium trade from Colombia) found west of the Andes in northern and western Colombia, northwestern Venezuela and Panama where adult males develop a distinct, bulbous red forehead. =Species= Geophagus sp. \\"orange head\\", an undescribed species from the Tapaj√≥s River There are currently 31 recognized species in this genus.

The picture features Ida Lupino, Cornel Wilde, Celeste Holm, and Richard Widmark, among others.. The drama tells the story of Lily Stevens (Lupino) who takes a job as a singer at a roadhouse‚Äîcomplete with a bowling alley. When Lily rebuffs the owner Jefty (Widmark) in favor of his boyhood friend Pete Morgan (Wilde), problems begin. They only get worse when Jefty is rejected after proposing to Lily, causing Jefty to go on a murderous rage. Lupino sings the classic Johnny Mercer song \\"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)\\" in the film. The song \\"Again\\", written by Dorcas Cochran (words) and Lionel Newman (music), debuted in this film, and was also sung by her. Plot Pete Morgan manages Jefty's Road House for his longtime friend, Jefferson \\"Jefty\\" Robbins, who inherited the place from his father. Jefty is attracted to Lily Stevens, his new singer from Chicago, but Pete thinks she is just another in a long string of girls he will eventually have to send on her way when Jefty tires of her. For his part, however, Jefty is convinced that Lily is \\"different\\", even though she is playing hard to get. Although Pete tries to pay Lily off and put her on a train, she refuses to leave and makes a successful debut at the club, accompanying herself on piano. Jefty asks Pete to teach Lily how to bowl in the roadhouse's alley, but she shows little interest in the sport and quite a bit more in Pete. Susie Smith, the club's cashier who is fond of Pete, becomes jealous of Lily. Before Jefty leaves on a hunting trip, he tells Lily that she is not like any other girl he has ever met. Lily tries to join Pete for a boat ride on a lake, but he refuses as she is \\"Jefty's girl\\". Lily disputes that notion, so Pete arranges to pick her up later. Susie also goes along, although the women's friendship is decidedly frosty. Later, Pete comes to Lily's rescue when a drunk causes a scene at the club. Lily and Pete share a passionate kiss. Pete loves her, and it is obvious she feels the same way. Their idyll is interrupted when Jefty returns and shows Pete a marriage license he has obtained in his and Lily's names. Pete tells Jefty that he and Lily are planning to be married. Jefty throws him out. Lily and Pete decide to leave the roadhouse together and he leaves a note, stating in it that he has taken $600 owed to him. At the railroad station, two policemen detain Pete and Lily. Jefty claims that the entire week's receipts have been taken from the roadhouse's safe, but Pete insists he took only $600. After Susie states that the receipts totaled $2,600, Pete is held for trial and Lily accuses Jefty of framing him. Pete is tried and found guilty of grand larceny. Before sentencing, Jefty talks to the judge in private and persuades him to parole Pete into his custody. The judge announces that Pete will be on probation for two years, but will have his job back and will be obligated to repay Jefty from his paycheck. Pete and Lily realize that Jefty has them trapped. Jefty plans a trip to his hunting cabin. Pete wants to cross the Canada‚ÄìUS border, which is only fifteen miles from the road house but Lily refuses to go along, convincing Pete that Jefty wants the two of them to argue and for Pete to run away. At his cabin, Jefty taunts Pete and Lily while fooling around with a rifle. Lily accuses Jefty of taking the missing money, so Jefty hits her. Pete retaliates by knocking him out. Lily decides that she will go with Pete to Canada, which is now only about two miles through the woods and across a stream, and they set off on foot. Susie, meanwhile, discovers a deposit envelope for the receipts in Jefty's coat pocket, proof of Pete's innocence and Jefty's false testimony. She follows and finds the couple. As she gives the envelope to Pete, Susie is shot in the arm by a pursuing Jefty. In the fog-enshrouded lakeside, Pete cranks up the motor on Jefty's boat and sends it off empty. After Jefty wastes bullets shooting at the boat, Pete tries to grab his gun. Lily gets possession of it and shoots Jefty when he threatens to hit her with a boulder. As Jefty dies, he reminds Pete that he once told him that Lily was \\"different\\". Dawn breaks as Pete, Lily and Susie (in Pete's arms) head out of the woods and back to civilization, to a subdued arrangement of Lionel Newman's \\"Again\\".

Indian Scouts saved the lives of many of Lt Col Steptoe's personnel during the Battle of Pine Creek. Most scouts came from the Nez Perce tribe. Military action taken from Fort Walla Walla In May 1858, the Battle of Pine Creek took place, when Lt Col. Steptoe lead troops north to investigate the reported murder of miners and was forced to retreat after being attacked by a mixed force of Spokane, Palouse, and Coeur d'Alene Indians near present Rosalia, Washington.Converse, George L., 1988, A Military History of the Columbia Valley 1848-1865, pps 45-47, Walla Walla, Washington, Pioneer Books.

This film tells the story of a successful writer named Harry Block, played by Allen, who draws inspiration from people he knows in real life, and from events that happened to him, sometimes causing these people to become alienated from him as a result. The central plot features Block driving to a university from which he was once thrown out, in order to receive an honorary degree. Three passengers accompany him on the journey: a prostitute, a friend, and his son, whom he has kidnapped from his ex-wife. However, there are many flashbacks, segments taken from Block's writing, and interactions with his own fictional characters. Deconstructing Harry received moderately positive reviews from critics. Plot One night, Lucy (Judy Davis) gets a taxi to the home of author Harry Block (Woody Allen). She has just read Harry's latest novel. In the novel, the character Leslie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is having an affair with her sister's husband Ken (Richard Benjamin). Lucy is angry because the novel is patently based on her and Harry's own affair; as a result, everyone knows about it. Lucy pulls a gun out of her purse, saying she will kill herself. She then turns the gun on Harry and begins firing. She chases him out onto the roof. Harry insists that he has already been punished: his latest girlfriend Fay (Elisabeth Shue) has left him for his best friend Larry (Billy Crystal). To distract Lucy, Harry tells her a story he is currently writing: a semi-autobiographical story of a sex-obsessed young man named Harvey (Tobey Maguire) who is mistakenly claimed by Death. In therapy, Harry realizes he has not changed since he was a sex-obsessed youth. Harry discusses the honoring ceremony at his old university, taking place the next day; he is particularly unhappy that he has nobody with whom to share the occasion. After the session, Harry asks his ex-wife Joan (Kirstie Alley) if he can take their son Hilliard (Eric Lloyd) to the ceremony. She refuses, stating that Harry is a bad influence on Hilliard. She is also furious at Harry for the novel he wrote. In it, the character Epstein (Stanley Tucci) marries Helen (Demi Moore), but the marriage begins to crumble after the birth of their son. Harry runs into an acquaintance, Richard (Bob Balaban), who is worried about his health. After accompanying Richard to the hospital, Harry asks him to come to the university ceremony. Richard appears uninterested. Harry then goes to meet his ex-girlfriend Fay, who reveals that she is now engaged. Harry begs Fay to get back together with him. He asks Fay to accompany him to his ceremony, but it clashes with Fay's wedding, scheduled the following day. That night, Harry sleeps with a prostitute, Cookie (Hazelle Goodman). Harry then asks Cookie to accompany him to his ceremony. In the morning, Richard unexpectedly arrives to join Harry and Cookie on the journey. On a whim, Harry decides to \\"kidnap\\" his son Hilliard. Along the way, they stop at a carnival, then at Harry's half- sister Doris's (Caroline Aaron). Doris, a devoted Jew, is upset by Harry's portrayals of Judaism in his stories, as is her husband (Eric Bogosian). During the journey, Harry also encounters his fictional creations Ken and Helen, who force him to confront some painful truths about his life. Just before arriving at the university, Richard dies peacefully in the car. While filming, Harry's fictional alter ego, Mel (Robin Williams) literally slides out of focus, becoming blurred. The university's staffers gush over Harry, asking what he plans to write next. He describes a story about a man (based on himself) who journeys down to Hell to reclaim his true love (based on Fay) from the Devil (based on Larry - both being played by Billy Crystal). Harry and the Devil engage in a verbal duel as to who is truly the more evil of the two. Harry gets as far as arguing that he is a kidnapper before the story is interrupted by the arrival of the police. Harry is arrested for kidnapping Hilliard, for possessing a gun (it was Lucy's), and for having drugs in the car (belonging to Cookie). Larry and Fay come from their wedding to bail Harry out of jail. Harry reluctantly gives them his blessings. Back at his apartment, a miserable Harry fantasizes that the university's ceremony is taking place. Harry realizes that he can only function in art, not in life. The film ends with Harry returning to his writing.

Awards and nominations Woody Allen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Deconstructing Harry. The film was also nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äî Comedy or Musical. Influences The film is a general reworking of his earlier 1980 film Stardust Memories, which also had an artist go to a ceremony in his honor, while reminiscing over past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize current ones. Allen is an admirer of several European directors whose primary body of work was completed sometimes decades before his first script, and his films in particular often draw upon the works of Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. The rough outline of the plot of Deconstructing Harry, that of an academic on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university while reflecting upon his life's experiences, essentially mirrors that of Bergman's Wild Strawberries. Also, the film is similar to Fellini's 8¬Ω, in that it is about an artist struggling with his current relationships and remembering his old ones, interspersed with dream sequences, as well as his work being based on events from his life. It is acknowledged by some critics that Allen based the name of Harry Block on Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), the protagonist from Bergman's The Seventh Seal. Some critics, including Roger Ebert, have suggested that the character of Harry Block is based on real-life author Philip Roth and not on Allen himself.

He was best known as the author of The Last Victim: A True-Life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer (1999), a memoir about his exploration of the minds of incarcerated serial killers, which started as a research project in college. He corresponded and conducted personal interviews with several notorious killers. Struggling with depression, Moss died by suicide in 2006. His book was adapted and produced as a film, Dear Mr. Gacy, released in 2010. Personal life Moss was born in Bethpage, New York in 1975 and attended local schools. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. As an honors student, he had completed a research project into the minds of serial killers by establishing correspondence with them and gaining interviews. At the age of 19, he met twice with John Wayne Gacy in prison, less than two months before the killer was executed. Shaken by the experience, in which he felt psychologically manipulated, Moss had nightmares. He wrote a book about his project and its effects, co-authored with counseling professor Jeffrey Kottler, and published in 1999 as The Last Victim: A True-Life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer. After college, Moss served internships with the U.S. Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. He decided to go into law and graduated in 2002 from University of Michigan Law School. He set up a criminal defense practice in Henderson, Nevada. He was married to Charlotte Moss. The Last Victim While writing his honors thesis at UNLV, Moss established relationships with convicted, imprisoned serial killers John Wayne Gacy, Richard Ramirez, Henry Lee Lucas, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Charles Manson. He conducted research in order to learn what would most appeal to each of his subjects, and adopted the role of disciple, admirer, surrogate, or potential victim as necessary. He initiated the relationships through correspondence. According to Kottler, Moss studied devil worship and Satanic rituals before contacting Ramirez.\\"The Last Victim' author committed suicide\\", Dead Silence blog, 3 October 2006, accessed 10 May 2015 Moss later said that he formed the strongest relationship with Gacy. Their exchange of letters led to regular Sunday morning phone calls, during which Gacy reiterated his innocence. In his book, Moss explored the development of his correspondence with Gacy, shortly before the killer was executed. Moss asserted that he became Gacy's \\"last victim\\" during their face-to-face meeting. While he understood that he had deliberately lured Gacy, he felt overpowered and manipulated by him, in the same way that he might have manipulated and controlled his victims. Moss felt that his overall experience allowed him to gain an understanding of how a serial killer's mind works. =Reception= Moss's book quickly became a bestseller. In 2000 a paperback edition was released, and also made the New York Times bestseller list.\\"PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS: March 12, 2000\\", The New York Times, 12 March 2000 A film adaptation of the book, Dear Mr. Gacy, was released in 2010, starring Jesse Moss (no relation) and William Forsythe. Suicide Jason Moss died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in his Henderson, Nevada home on the morning of June 6, 2006. The significance, if any, of his chosen suicide date (6/6/06) has been the subject of speculation. According to his co-author Kottler, Moss reportedly had delved \\"heavily into Satanic stuff\\" while researching material to prepare for his correspondence with serial killers and while writing his book, but sounded upbeat in their last conversation before his death.Kalil, M (June 13, 2006): \\"Best-selling author of book on serial killer kills himself\\", LV Review- Journal archive], Retrieved October 20, 2011  References  External links *Crimelibrary chapter on Jason Moss *Obituary: Jason Moss, Las Vegas Review Journal *Book Review on Google *Dear Mr. Gacy, 2006 film website - screenplay adapted from Moss & Kottler's book Category:1975 births Category:2006 deaths Category:American male writers who committed suicide Category:American memoirists Category:Jewish American attorneys Category:Suicides by firearm in Nevada Category:People from Bethpage, New York Category:Nevada lawyers Category:University of Nevada, Las Vegas alumni Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:John Wayne Gacy Category:20th-century memoirists ","title":"Jason Moss (writer)"},{"id":"2093635","text":"South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) is the national centre for optical and infrared astronomy in South Africa. It was established in 1972. The observatory is run by the National Research Foundation of South Africa. The facility's function is to conduct research in astronomy and astrophysics. The primary telescopes are located in Sutherland, which is from Observatory, Cape Town, where the headquarters is located. The SAAO has links worldwide for scientific and technological collaboration. Instrumental contributions from the South African Astronomical Observatory include the development of a spherical aberration corrector and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). The Noon Gun on Cape Town's Signal Hill is fired remotely by a time signal from the Observatory.  History  The buildings of the South African Astronomical Observatory in Cape Town. The history of the SAAO began when the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope was founded in 1820, the first scientific institution in Africa. Construction of the main buildings was completed in 1829 at a cost of ¬£30,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The post of Her Majesty's astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope was awarded the Royal Medal on two occasions; the first to Thomas Maclear in 1869 for measurement of an arc of the meridian at the Cape of Good Hope and the second to David Gill in 1903 for researches in solar and stellar parallax, and his energetic direction of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. The Republic Observatory, Johannesburg, was merged with the much older Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope in January 1972 to form the South African Astronomical Observatory. In 1974 the Radcliffe Observatory telescope was purchased by the CSIR and moved to Sutherland, where it recommenced work in 1976. SAAO was established in January 1972, as a result of a joint agreement by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) of South Africa and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) of United Kingdom. The headquarters are located on the grounds of the old Royal Observatory where the main building, offices, national library for astronomy and computer facilities are housed. Historic telescopes are also found at the headquarters in a number of domes and a small museum that displays scientific instruments. The South African Astronomical Observatory is administered at present as a National Facility under management of the National Research Foundation (NRF), formerly the Foundation for Research Development (FRD). In 1974, when the Radcliffe Observatory in Pretoria closed, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) purchased the 1.9-m Radcliffe telescope and transported it to Sutherland.  Facilities  Sign at the entrance to Sutherland Observatory near Sutherland, Northern Cape The observatory operates from the campus of the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope that was established in 1820 in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town.

This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. It also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included. The season officially began on May 15, 2004 in the eastern Pacific proper (June 1, 2004 in the central Pacific) and lasted until November 30 that same year. Areas east of 140¬∞W are under the purview of the National Hurricane Center (NHC); the area between the International Date Line and 140¬∞W, or the central Pacific, is under the purview of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). The 2004 season got off to an early start with Tropical Storm Agatha, which formed a week after the season began. No tropical cyclones were active in June, the first such occurrence since 1969. July was more active, producing four tropical cyclones. Three of these (Blas, Celia, and Darby) became named storms, two (Celia and Darby) became hurricanes, and Hurricane Darby became the first major hurricane of the season. Additionally, a tropical depression in the central Pacific became the only tropical cyclone to form within the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility during the year. August was the most active month, producing six tropical cyclones, four named storms, and two hurricanes (Frank and Howard). September saw a decline in activity, although all three storms that existed during the month were hurricanes, two of which (Howard and Javier) were major hurricanes. Hurricane Howard, which had formed in August, only became a major hurricane in September. Hurricane Javier ‚Äì the final storm during the month ‚Äì was the strongest storm of the season. October saw the final three tropical cyclones of the year; two developed into named storms (Kay and Lester). Neither of these storms became hurricanes.

Sparklies are black or white 'hard' interference dots (as opposed to the 'soft' interference patterns of terrestrial television), caused either by too weak or too strong a signal. When within the satellite's rated reception footprint, sparklies are most likely to be caused by a misaligned dish, or LNBs which are too high- or too low-gain for the dish and receiver.

He is also founding member of such punk groups as Richard Hell and the Voidoids and Lovelies. He has performed with the Isley Brothers, The Clash, Matthew Sweet, The Bongos, Richard Barone, and Shriekback. Biography =Early life and career= Julian was inspired after seeing Jimi Hendrix play, not so much by Hendrix's guitar style, but the freedom of expression that Hendrix represented. Julian apparently went home and burned his Chuck Taylor shoes in his backyard- a symbolic gesture against conformity. The child of a Navy officer, Julian spent his formative years moving a great deal, spending time in Haiti and Cuba before the family settled in Washington D.C. He enjoyed spending time alone and was an avid reader of books by Edgar Allan Poe and Ovid. He also enjoyed putting his own thoughts in writing. When he was 13, Julian sang in a Led Zeppelin cover band, which led him to pick up the guitar at 14. Prior to this, he also studied bassoon and saxophone. He spent his high school years as a part-time student in a college program studying music theory. And then at the age of 17, Julian toured the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia as a member of The Foundations, known for hits like \\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\" and \\"Baby Now That I Found You‚Äù. =The Voidoids, Blank Generation= In 1977 Julian returned to the U.S. to New York, where he was a founding member of the seminal Punk/ New Wave group Richard Hell and the Voidoids. Soon after the band recorded an EP that was heralded by the Village Voice as one of the best records of the year. Early traces of Julian's prowess grace two sides of this historical platter. Later that year they were signed to Sire/Warner Brothers, and with the band and Richard Gottehrer producing came the Blank Generation LP. This album set a new standard for a whole generation of guitar players. Two of Julian's songs (co- written with Richard Hell), \\"Liars Beware\\" and \\"Betrayal Takes Two\\" appear on side one. The reviewers gave the album high accolades and singled out the guitar work praising its merit. The album stands the test of time and today is still considered among the quintessential records of that period. =The Outsets (1980‚Äì85)= Julian formed The Outsets just after the breakup of Richard Hell and the Voidoids in 1980. He remembered seeing Vinny DeNunzio, of The Feelies, playing with Richard Lloyd's band and being impressed. As it turned out Vinny was ready for a change so they started holding auditions for bass and the other guitar. When the word got out, Fred Smith (Television, Blondie), Ted Niceley (producer, Fugazi and Girls vs. Boys), and Tommy Keene were among those that came to play. Niceley and Keene had both played in (the) Razz, a D.C. band whose members were friends with Julian. Eventually the positions were filled by Bob Albertson on bass and Simon Chardiet on guitar. Soon after the band went into rehearsals and prepared for live dates at CBGB's and Max's Kansas City. At this point there were more venues opening up such as the Mudd Club, Danceteria catering to a new minimal, percussive style of music and Ivan wanted to be part of it. The plan as always was to venture out with fresh fine and to new places, so the first gig was booked at Tier 3, a performance space in Soho. After several months the band was signed to Contender Records and released their first single, \\"I'm Searchin' For You\\" b/w \\"Fever\\". Much has been made of the misprint on the label that incorrectly list the publishing rights for the B side. As a result, the record company corrected the mistake after the first pressing which has made it somewhat of a collectors item. The songs on The Punk/Funk Voodoo Collection were recorded in the basement studio of Giorgio Gomelsky, Yardbirds producer and early manager of the Rolling Stones. He persuaded Ivan Julian and the band to explore sounds outside of the boundaries of American pop music, most notably Fela Kuti. The music and the lyrics resound with the rough and tumble immediacy of East Village New York in the early 1980s. Included as Bonus Tracks are remastered versions of The Outsets first single originally released as a 45 on Contender records. Garland Jeffreys approached Ivan and offered to produce The Outsets forthcoming EP \\"The Ice Man\\", which also involved Bob Clearmountain as engineer. During this time he also recorded with Tomas Donker from Defunkt, Afrika Bambaataa and Bernie Worrell of Parliament/Funkadelic fame. Originally released in the U.S. on Plexus Records playing keyboards on the bonus tracks is Marsha Sardy who also played with The Julian. =1988: Lovelies= Julian formed a group called Lovelies which included his then-wife, former Bush Tetras vocalist Cynthia Sley in 1988.Grant, Steven & Robbins, Ira \\"Bush Tetras/Floor Kiss/Lovelies/Outsets\\", Trouser Press; retrieved 2012-02-18Strong, Martin C.

LP. Mick Jones and Joe Strummer wanted Julian to join them in the studio but he was touring with his band, The Outsets. Upon his return he recorded with them and helped to develop the single from Sandinista!, entitled \\"The Call Up\\". The English bands Shriekback, founded by Dave Allen from the Gang of Four and Barry Andrews of XTC, asked Julian on two tours of the North America and Europe. Julian's thoughts on being compared to Hendrix? \\"I never wanted to emulate him because he is someone that can't be touched, but I am honoured that people would say that about me.\\" With his influences being such notable figures as Charlie Parker, Albert Ayler and Charlie Christian it is no wonder that he has developed a distinct style all his own. Julian states, \\"There is a piece of their soul in every note they play.\\" During most of the nineties Julian recorded and toured the world with Matthew Sweet as lead guitarist earning him three Gold Record Awards. He continues to write and produce music at his analog tape/digital recording studio, NY HED where he has produced the last 2 The Fleshtones LP's, and mastered Five Dollar Priest among others. =Recovery from cancer= After Julian was diagnosed with Stage III gastrointestinal cancer in 2015, a two-day benefit concert was staged for him at City Winery in New York. The musicians who performed included Debbie Harry, Thurston Moore, and Matthew Sweet. Declared cancer-free in 2016, Julian played a comeback show at Bell House in Brooklyn.

Toy balloons are usually made of rubber or aluminized plastic, and inflated with air or helium. They come in a great variety of sizes and shapes, but are most commonly 10 to 30 centimetres in diameter. Toy balloons are not considered to include \\"sky lanterns\\" (hot-air paper balloons), although these too are or were used as child toys in some parts of the world. According to The Journal of the American Medical Association, out of 373 children who died in the US between 1972 and 1992 after choking on children's products, nearly a third choked on latex balloons. The Consumer Products Safety Commission found that children had inhaled latex balloons whole (often while trying to inflate them) or choked on fragments of broken balloons. Parents, a monthly magazine about raising children, advised parents to buy Mylar balloons instead of latex balloons. History Illustration from the Luttrell Psalter (c1320-1340) depicting a pig bladder balloon Children inflating a bladder, painting c1773 Early balloons were made from pig bladders and animal intestines. All you need to know about balloonsRubber Balloon Evolution The Aztecs created the first balloon sculptures using cat intestines, which were then presented to the gods as a sacrifice.Jean Merlin, Kaufman and Greenberg, Great Balloons! The Complete Book of Balloon Sculpting, 1994. There are references to balloons made of whale intestine in Swiss Family Robinson (1813) and in Moby Dick (1851).The History of Balloons The first rubber balloons were made by Professor Michael Faraday in 1824 for use in his experiments with hydrogen at the Royal Institution in London. \\"The caoutchouc is exceedingly elastic,\\" he wrote in the Quarterly Journal of Science the same year. \\"Bags made of it...have been expanded by having air forced into them, until the caoutchouc was quite transparent, and when expanded by hydrogen they were so light as to form balloons with considerable ascending power....\\" Faraday made his balloons by cutting round two sheets of rubber laid together and pressing the edges together. The tacky rubber welded automatically, and the inside of the balloon was rubbed with flour to prevent the opposing surfaces joining together.Mechanics' Magazine and Journal of Science, Arts, and Manufactures, Vol. 2, Knight and Lacey, 1824; p. 327 Latex rubber toy balloons were introduced by pioneer rubber manufacturer Thomas Hancock the following year in the form of a do-it-yourself kit consisting of a bottle of rubber solution and a condensing syringe. Vulcanized toy balloons, which unlike the earlier kind were unaffected by changes in temperature, were first manufactured by J.G. Ingram of London in 1847 and can be regarded as the prototype of modern toy balloons.Patrick Robertson, The Book of Firsts, Bramhall House, NY, 1978. Since the 1890s, paper balloons called kamif≈´sen have been popular children's toys in Japan. In the 1920s Neil Tillotson designed and produced a latex balloon with a cat's face and ears from a cardboard form which he cut by hand with a pair of scissors. He managed to make his first sale of these balloons with an order of 15 gross to be delivered for the annual Patriots' Day Parade on April 19, 1931. The first colored balloons were sold at the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair.Arnold E. Grummer, The Great Balloon Game Book and More Balloon Activities, Greg Markim, Inc., Appleton, Wisconsin, 1987 Foil balloons Inflatable foil balloons are made from plastics, such as biaxially-oriented PET film. Foil balloons are not elastic like rubber balloons, so that detailed and colorful pictures printed on their surfaces are not distorted when the balloon is inflated. Foil balloons are thus named because they sometimes have a metallic coating to make them shiny; however, there have been concerns about metallic balloons causing short circuits when caught in overhead power lines. Because metallic balloons can cause power outages like on overhead catenary train lines, it is recommended that the metallic balloons not only be tied by a string or ribbon with no metal in it, but also securely tied down by a weight to prevent the balloon from floating away and some train operators either issue advisories on how to handle balloons or ban balloons altogether. When no longer required, it is recommended to cut the balloon to release the helium and dispose of in a garbage container. Filling Helium filled balloons Every toy balloon has an opening (or mouth) through which gases are blown into it, followed by a connecting tube known as the neck. Balloons are usually filled by using one's breath, a pump, or a pressurized gas tank. The opening can then be permanently tied off or clamped temporarily. Foil balloons are typically self-sealing. By filling a balloon with a gas lighter than air, such as helium, the balloon can be made to float. Helium is the preferred gas for floating balloons, because it is inert and will not catch fire (like hydrogen) or cause toxic effects when inhaled. Small, light objects (postcards, in balloon mail for example) are sometimes placed in balloons along with helium and released into the air and, when the balloon eventually falls, the object inside might be found by another person. Rubber balloons can also be filled with liquids (usually water) and can burst when they impact a solid object. Liquid-filled balloons are commonly referred to as water balloons or water bombs and used in playful fights, and sometimes vandalism. Balloon shapes Most toy balloons are a simple oval-like shape. But balloon suppliers also offers other shapes for toy balloons. Some examples of other shapes are: \\"zeppelins\\" or \\"airships,\\" where balloons are usually longer than wide; \\"espirals\\" or \\"rattlesnakes,\\" similar to zeppelins, but much longer (not to be confused with balloons for twisting); \\"hearts,\\" balloons with the shape of a heart; \\"dolls,\\" two round shapes joined that represent a head and a body; \\"mouseheads,\\" composed of three round parts, one for the head and two for the ears; \\"bunnyheads,\\" similar to mouseheads but with long ears; \\"bunny balloons,\\" which resemble a stuffed toy bunny, having a big long shape for the body, a smaller shape for the head, and two long shapes for the ears; \\"elephants,\\" with two shapes for the body and the head, and a very long shape for the trunk; and \\"ducks,\\" with a big shape for the body, a smaller round shape for the head and smaller shape for the beak. There are many other possible shapes, depending on the manufacturers. Balloon modeling A balloon artist in Vienna, Austria There are balloons that are longer and more cylindrical. These long balloons are often twisted and bent into simple, or intricate shapes which will hold their form when released. Balloon artists are people who quickly twist balloons into familiar or abstract shapes using the techniques of balloon modelling, usually for profit. Other names for balloon modeling include: balloon twisting, balloon bending, or simply twisting. Artists who practice balloon modeling are called: Balloon Twisters, Balloon Benders, Balloon Modeler and even have been referred to as a Latex Vessel Reconstruction Engineer.A number of balloon twisting figures and a child with modeling balloons made into different shapes. The types of balloons used for this practice are pencil balloons and are called 160s, 260s, 350s, 360s, 660s or 646s. These number designations refer to the sizes of the balloons and roughly equate to the diameter and the length of the balloon when fully inflated. The 260, one of the most common animal balloon sizes, would be 2 inches in diameter and then 60 inches long when fully inflated. The modeling balloons can be made into simple dogs, hearts, and swords or can be made into more intricate shapes such as dragons, cartoon characters, or even figments of the imaginations. More and more nearly anything is becoming possible with balloon twisting and it shows at major industry conventions such as Twist and Shout, the largest balloon twisting convention in the world. Noises Toy balloon in the sky of Eastern Siberia Toy balloons are often characterized with its distinctive noises if manipulated in some ways. These noises include: * Popping: The common loud noise of an inflated balloon when it bursts. When a balloon bursts, the torn parts of the rubber suddenly contracts with sufficient force to exceed the speed of sound and forms a small sonic boom. It happens simultaneously as a sudden air pressure change from the inside, causing a rapid shockwave that creates the sharp, loud popping sound. Globophobia is an uncommon kind of phobia (fear) commonly associated with the popping noise produced by balloons. * Squeaking: It is done by inflating the balloon, then slowly release the air by stretching the neck or the mouth sideways. The stretched part creates a very tight and tiny gap for air to flow, then the air pressure causes the opening to oscillate and vibrate, creating a loud high-pitched squeaking or screeching noise. The sound can be changed by adjusting the tension of the stretching. This is the same way that how vocal cords and reed instrument works. Rocket balloons, however, could create this noise by simply deflating, due to the tighter neck. * \\"Raspberry\\" sound: It is done by simply releasing an inflated balloon and letting it deflate. The escaping air pressure creates a turbulence that causes the flexible opening to flap back and forth rapidly, creating a deep, long \\"flatulence\\"-like noise. The balloon will also propelled away because of the Newton's third law of motion, a phenomenon commonly known as balloon rocket. This can also be done by pinching the balloon's neck, then slowly open the mouth without letting it loose. The open end vibrates instead of flapping, creating a similar, yet higher pitched noise. * Scratching: It is done by simply rubbing a hand against the balloon itself, providing the balloon is fully inflated, creating an elastic surface. * Thrumming: Hold the balloon by the opening valve (usually while it is knotted closed) and shake it. The balloon bounces and stretches, creating another distinctive sound. Uses Paolo Monti, 1962 Toy balloons are used as decorations and/or advertising space. Balloons are usually purchased in deflated form, however, some party stores and vendors at special events will fill their balloons before selling them, this is called \\"balloon stuffing\\" where the balloons are filled with objects such as smaller balloons, teddy bears, etc. While toy balloons are primarily a toy, they are also sometimes used for demonstrations and experiments in classrooms. During the 19th century, it was thought that rubber balloons could be used to replace certain organs, but this was quickly disproved. Toy balloons can be filled with water and used in a variety of ways, usually for fun. They can be thrown, or set up to drop on the head of an unsuspecting victim. Some Australians report using water balloons around their house during bushfires, as the heat of the flames breaks the balloon and causes the water to land on the fire. There are water balloons which are balloons specifically designed to be filled with water.

Employers also see coffee service as a perk with a low cost. Coffee services =Vending= A coffee dispenser machine next to a water dispenser Some companies, with high traffic of visitors and employees, opt to install a coffee dispenser (vending machine) as their coffee service. Typically these machines give the user the choice of various types of coffee, tea and hot chocolate.Account Suspended Money collected is usually kept by the employer to offset the cost of the maintenance contract and for the purchase of the instant coffee used by the machine. However, sometimes companies make the coffee from such machines free. Unfortunately, the coffee dispensed by these machines is usually of low quality. =Electric coffee maker= Another option is to use an automatic espresso or drip coffee maker which grinds the coffee beans and dispenses the coffee into a cup. These machines do not charge per cup, but often provide a bypass slot where the employee can add their own coffee beans. By providing low quality beans, employees can be encouraged to provide their own beans. The cost of the maintenance contract still falls on the employer, however it is about the same as the cost of the machine per year. =\\"Frac pacs\\"= An increasingly popular preparation offered by coffee service providers is known as a frac pac. This is ground coffee in a self- contained packet, enveloped by a filter. This allows a conventional drip coffee maker to be used, but without the mess of cleaning out the old grounds and without the requirement to measure out the right amount of coffee. The user only needs remove the old pack and to place the new pack into their coffee machine. The downside of such a service is quality of the coffee. Unless canned, coffee needs to be brewed within the first week of roasting and within four hours of grinding for the best quality. Since local roasters will generally not have a filter enveloping machine, these packs are shipped great distances and may be weeks old before they even arrive at the office. =Onsite espresso bars= Some companies now provide on their premises full espresso bars where employees or contractors provide a full range of espresso drinks, free of charge or at company-subsidized prices.

She is worshiped as Siddha Kubjika, and is also identified as Kali and Maha Tripura Sundari. According to the Tantric texts (Kalika Purana, Yogini Tantra) that are the basis for her worship at the Kamakhya temple, a 16th-century temple in the Kamrup district of Assam. The earlier manifest of the goddess sanctified at the Garo hills is destroyed, although the Vatsayana priests are said to have carried away the manifest of the goddess to the Hindu kingdom in Kashmir and later sanctified in a remote hill forest in Himachal Pradesh. Her name means \\"renowned goddess of desire,\\" and she resides at the presently rebuilt Kamakhya Temple in 1645 C. The temple is primary amongst the 51 Shakti Peethas related to the sect that follows Sati, and remains one of the most important Shakta temples and Hindu pilgrimage sites in the world.  Origins  The origin of worship 'Shakti' at the site is associated with the legend of Sati, who was the wife of the ascetic god Shiva and daughter of the Puranic god-king Daksha. Daksha was unhappy with his daughter's choice of husband, and when he performed a grand Yajna for all the deities, he did not invite Shiva or Sati. In a rage, Sati threw herself onto the fire, knowing that this would make the sacrifice impure. Because she was the all-powerful mother goddess, Sati left her body in that moment to be reborn as the goddess Parvati. Meanwhile, Shiva was stricken with grief and rage at the loss of his wife. He put Sati's body over his shoulder and began his tandava (dance of cosmic destruction) throughout the heavens, and vowed not to stop until the body was completely rotted away. The other Gods, afraid of their annihilation, implored Vishnu to pacify Shiva. Thus, wherever Shiva wandered while dancing, Vishnu followed. He sent his discus Sudarshana to destroy the corpse of Sati. Pieces of her body fell until Shiva was left without a body to carry. Seeing this, Shiva sat down to do Mahatapasya (great penance). Despite the similarity in name, scholars do not generally believe that this legend gave rise to the practice of sati or the voluntary giving of the wife's body on the pyre of her husband .J.S. Hawley, Sati, the Blessing and the Curse. Oxford University Press (New York: 1994). p. 50-1. According to various myths and traditions, there are 51 pieces of Sati's body scattered across the Indian subcontinent. These places are called shakti peethas and are dedicated to various powerful goddesses. Kamarupa (\\"form of desire\\") is the region in which the yoni (\\"vulva,\\" \\"womb,\\" or \\"source\\") is said to have fallen to earth, and the Kamakhya temple was said to have been constructed on this spot.  Identity  Kamakhya is mentioned in the Kalika Purana as the most important goddess of Tantric worship, and is referred to in the text as Mahamaya, the \\"great goddess of illusion\\", who takes on many forms depending on her mood. Devotees also call her Kameshwari (\\"beloved goddess of desire\\"), and consider her a form of Maha Tripura Sundari, also called Shodashi. She is identified with Kali in the Kalika Purana, Yoginitantra and Kamakhya Tantra, each of which echoes this verse:B. Shastri. Kamakhya Tantra. Bharatiy Vidya Prakash (Delhi, Varanasi: 1990). p. 20. yƒÅ devi kƒÅlikƒÅ mƒÅtƒÅ sarva vidyƒÅsvar≈´pinƒ´  kƒÅmƒÅkhyƒÅ saiva vikhyƒÅtƒÅ satyam devi nacƒÅnyathƒÅ  > \\"It is certainly well known that Kamakhya is truly none other than that > mother goddess Kali, who is in all things the form of wisdom.\\" Kamakhya is associated with the Dasa Mahavidyas, who each have temples dedicated to them at the Kamakhya temple complex in Assam. She is also closely associated with Durga. Four Adi Shakti Peethas The great mythological texts including the Kalika Purana (the Asthashakti) and various Tantras recognize the four major Shakti Peethas as Adi Shakti Peethas. Like (Bimala, Pada Khanda) inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha, (Tara Tarini) Sthana Khanda (Breasts), near Brahmapur, Odisha, (Kamakhya, Yoni khanda) in Guwahati, Assam and (Dakhina Kalika, Mukha khanda) in Kolkata, West Bengal originated from the limbs of the Corpse of Mata Sati. In a hymn, the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti) clearly says: ‚ÄúVimala Pada khandancha, Stana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini), Kamakhya Yoni khandancha, Mukha khandancha Kalika (Kali) Anga pratyanga sangena Vishnu Chakra Kshate nacha‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Peetha Body Part Place Vimala Pada khanda Puri, Odisha Tara Tarini Stana khanda Brahmapur, Odisha Kamakhya Yoni khanda Guwahati, Assam Dakshina Kalika Mukha khanda Kolkata, West Bengal ''' Mantras for general worship of the Mahavidyas at the Kamakhya temple complex reveal a close identity with Kamakhya herself. Several of these goddesses are worshipped as forms of Kamakhya explicitly.Viswa Shanti Devi Yajna. Viswa Shanti Devi Yajna Committee. Mandala Communications (Guwahati: 2004). pp. 22-8. Devi Kamakhya's 'Ashtashaktis' or eight incarnations are Guptakama,Srikama,Vindhyavasini,Kotishvari,Vanadurga,Padadurga,Dirgheshvari and Bhuvaneshvari. Legend Once Narakasura, motivated by his desire, wanted to marry Devi Kamakhya. When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a staircase from the bottom of the Nilachal Hill to the temple within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him. Naraka took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. He was almost about to accomplish the job before it was dawn. When Kamakhya Devi got this news, she playfully strangled a cock and made it crow untimely to give the impression of Dawn to Naraka. Duped by the trick even Naraka thought that it was a futile job and left it halfway through. Now the place is known as Kukurakata situated in the district of Darrang. The incomplete staircase is known as Mekhelauja Path.KƒÅmar≈´pa AnusandhƒÅn Samiti (2007),Journal of the Assam Research Society - Volume 38,p.30 Drunk with power, as he knew himself to be unrivalled in prowess, he brought all the kingdoms on earth under his control. Next, he turned his eyes towards Swargaloka. Even the mighty Indra could not withstand the assault of this son of Vishnu and had to flee the heavens. Narakasura had become the overlord of both the heavens and earth. Addicted to power, he stole the earrings of Aditi, the heavenly mother goddess, and usurped some of her territory, while also kidnapping 16000 women. All the Devas, led by Indra, went to Vishnu to ask him to deliver them from Narakasura. Vishnu promised them that he would attend to this matter, when he would be incarnated as Krishna.B. K. Chaturvedi (2017), Vishnu Puran As promised to Mother Earth, Narakasura was allowed to enjoy a long reign. At last Vishnu was born as Krishna. Aditi, who was a relative of Krishna's wife Satyabhama (believed to be an Avatar of Bhudevi - Narakasura' mother), approached Satyabhama for help. When Satyabhama heard of the Narakasura's ill treatment of women and his behaviour with Aditi, she was enraged. Satyabhama approached Lord Krishna for permission to wage a war against Narakasura. As promised to the Devas and Aditi, Krishna attacked the great fortress of Narakasura, riding his mount Garuda with wife Satyabhama. Lord Krishna used the Narayanastra and the Agneyastra against the army of Narakasura. The battle was furiously fought. Narakasura possessed 11 Akshauhinis that he unleashed on Lord Krishna. However, the Lord slew them all with little effort. Lord Krishna also killed Mura, Narakasura's general. Thus Krishna is called 'MurƒÅri' (the killer of Mura).Dianne M. MacMillan (2008), Diwali: Hindu Festival of Lights, p.24 Narakasura used several divine weapons against Lord Krishna, but Krishna easily neutralised all those weapons. At last, when Narakasura tried to kill Lord Krishna with a trident, he saw Goddess Kamakhya standing beside Hari, and eventually Lord Krishna beheaded him with his Sudarshana Chakra (discus). Everything happened because of the maya made by the Goddess Kamakhya.Ayilam Subrahma·πáya Pa√±cƒÅpage≈õa Ayyar (1957), Sri Krishna: The Darling of Humanity, p.42 Before Narakasura's death, he requested a boon from his mother, Satyabhama, that everyone should celebrate his death with colorful light. Thus this day is celebrated as 'Naraka Chaturdashi' - the day before Diwali. Krishna's and Satyabhama's victory on Narakasura translated into freedom for all his prisoners and honoring of Aditi. Having rescued the 16,100 women, Krishna married them to restore them to their former dignity.Muriel Marion Underhill (1991), The Hindu Religious Year, p.59  Iconography  Kamakhya is pictured as a young goddess, 16 years old, with twelve arms and six heads of varying colors, representing a powerful goddess who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. She is wearing opulent jewelry and red flowers such as hibiscus. She holds in each of ten hands a lotus, trident, sword, bell, discus, bow, arrows, club or scepter, goad, and shield. Her remaining two hands hold a bowl, which is made either of gold or a skull. She is seated upon a lotus, directly on top of Lord Shiva, who in turn lies atop a lion. To each side of her sit Brahma and Vishnu, who are each seated upon a lotus, as well.

He was a Speaker of the Upper Creek Council and supported traditional culture. Also called '\\"Lamochatte\\"' after the battle of horseshoe bend where he jumped with his horse from an embankment with a 40 foot drop. Although known as a diplomatic chief, as a Red Stick traditionalist he led Creek forces against the United States government during the Creek Wars. Later he tried to overturn the Treaty of Indian Springs, but was forced to make a new treaty with the federal government in 1832. He was commissioned as a colonel and led forces against remaining Lower Creek and the Seminole in the first two wars of the US against them. Despite his efforts, he and his people were among the Seminole and others forced to remove to Indian Territory in 1836, where they settled in the Unassigned Lands. Despite this, during the American Civil War, Opothleyahola was among the minority of Creek in Indian Territory who supported the Union. Because of rising conflict within the tribe, he led his followers to Kansas as a refuge, and they had to undergo three battles along the way. This became known as the Trail of Blood on Ice, because the people suffered harsh conditions. Some people were housed at a federal fort, others in refugee camps in Kansas. All suffered from inadequate supplies, disease, and harsh winters. Opothleyahola died during the war at one of the refugee camps in Kansas. Early life and education Opothleyahola was born circa 1780 at Tuckabatchee, the Creek capital of the Upper Creek Towns, located in present- day Elmore County, Alabama. The Upper Creek Towns' population comprised the majority of the nation.Eddings, Anna. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\" Opothleyahola.\\" His name literally translated means 'child', 'good', 'whooper' or 'good speaker'. Langguth says the name could be translated as \\"...good shouting child.\\"Langguth, p. 52. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History, his father was Davy Cornell, a mixed-blood Creek, and his mother was afull-blood Creek; her name is not known. While Opothleyahola was of European and Creek ancestry, he was born to a Creek mother, and considered part of her clan and the tribe by birth. The Creek had a matrilineal kinship system of property holding and descent, making the mother's clan the determining one for the status of her children. Traditionally, her brothers were more important than the biological father in rearing the children. For instance, a maternal uncle would teach a boy men's roles, and introduce him to men's societies. The historian Angie Debo found evidence suggesting that the boy's father was David Evans, a trader of Welsh descent. He may have taught him English and literacy, or sent him to a European-American school. Politics Lower Creek leaders had made treaties with the state of Georgia to cede former hunting lands in 1790, 1802 and 1804. They had more interaction with European Americans, who came as traders and settlers in this area. The Creek had already lost use of the land for hunting because of settler encroachment. They began to adopt more farming practices in order to survive. Under pressure from Georgia and its settlers, they also had more relationship with Benjamin Hawkins, the US Indian agent of the Southeast. The differences between the Upper Creek and Lower Creek broke out into violence in 1812 in what was at first a civil war. The Red Sticks of the Upper Creek wanted to revive traditional culture and religion, and resisted assimilation, as well as the land cessions. Opothleyahola is believed to have allied with the British against the US forces as early as the War of 1812. He was among the Red Sticks in the Creek War of 1813‚Äì1814. This ended with defeat by General Andrew Jackson commanding a large allied force, including Lower Creek, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. At that time, Opothleyahola swore his allegiance to the Federal government. Leader of the Creek Later the young man developed as an influential and eloquent speaker who used his skills for his people first and foremost. He was selected as a Speaker for the chiefs, which was a distinct political role on the National Council, and he later became a \\"diplomatic chief.\\"Chris Rein, \\"The U.S. Army, Indian Agency, and the Path to Assimilation: The First Indian Home Guards in the American Civil War\\", Kansas History, Spring 2013, accessed 18 June 2014 He became a wealthy trader and owned a 2,000-acre (8 km¬≤) plantation near North Fork Town. As did other Creek and members of the Five Civilized Tribes, he purchased enslaved African Americans as workers for his plantation. Opothleyahola joined the Freemasons and accepted Christianity, becoming a Baptist. Alarmed by the land cessions made by chiefs of the Lower Towns without tribal consensus, the National Council of the Creek Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions by tribal members a capital offense. In 1825, William McIntosh and several Lower Creek chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs with the US, by which they gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia in exchange for payment and removal to lands west of the Mississippi River. McIntosh and others of the Treaty Party by then believed that relocation was inevitable, given the increasing numbers of European-American settlers entering their region, and they wanted to get the best deal possible for the Creek Nation. As the National Council had not given up on trying to resist United States encroachment, and passed a death sentence, supported by Opothleyahola, against McIntosh and other signatories of the 1825 Treaty. The chief Menawa led 200 warriors to attack McIntosh at his plantation. They killed him and another signatory chief, and burned down his mansion. The Creek elders realized that they would need experienced negotiators to present their case to Federal authorities. While Opothleyahola was a persuasive speaker, he was not fluent in the English language. They turned to the Cherokee for assistance. Major Ridge, a Cherokee leader, recommended that the Creek retain his son, John Ridge, and David Vann, who were young, well-educated men fluent in English, to travel with Opothleyahola and help prepare his negotiating positions.Langguth, p. 52 The Creek National Council, led by Opothleyahola, went to Washington, D.C., to protest the illegality of the 1825 treaty, saying its signatories did not have consensus of the council. President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic. The US government and the chiefs made a new treaty with more favorable terms, the Treaty of Washington (1826).Meserve, John Bartlett. \\"Chief Opothleyahola.\\" In: Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 9, Number 4, 1931. Retrieved December 27, 2013. But Georgia officials began forcibly removing the Indians from lands which it claimed under the 1825 treaty. In addition, the state ignored the 1832 US Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia, which said that the state's legislation to regulate activities within American Indian territories was unconstitutional. When the Alabama legislature also moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws over the Creek people, Opothleyahola appealed to the administration of President Andrew Jackson. He had already signed the 1830 Indian Removal Act and wanted the Creek and other tribes to move west. Given no relief, the Upper Creek signed the Treaty of Cusseta on March 24, 1832, which divided Creek lands into individual allotments. They could either sell their allotments and receive funds to remove to Indian Territory, or stay in Alabama as state and US citizens and submit to the state laws. In 1834, Opothleyahola traveled to Nacogdoches, Texas, to try to purchase communal land for his people. After he had paid landowners $20,000, pressure from both the Mexican and American governments forced Opothleyahola to abandon the idea. In 1836, Opothleyahola, commissioned as a colonel by the U.S. government, led 1,500 of his warriors against remaining rebellious Lower Creek, who had allied with Seminole in Florida in fighting the white occupation. Soon after, the US Army rounded up the remaining Creek and other Southeast Indian peoples and forced their emigration to Indian Territory, on what was known as the \\"Trail of Tears.\\" In 1837, Opothleyahola led 8,000 of his people from Alabama to lands north of the Canadian River in the Indian Territory, what were then called Unassigned Lands. (It is now part of the state of Oklahoma). Over time, they began to specialize in stock raising and grain production there. Civil War At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Opothleyahola and Creek remained loyal to the federal government. While it had passed legislation for Indian removal, they believed that the pressure for this came from Georgia and the southern populations, so did not support the Confederacy. The Lower Creek and some of the other of the Southeastern tribes, who had specialized in cotton production, held numerous slaves and had more cultural contacts with white settlers, supported the Confederacy. It had promised them an Indian-controlled state if they won the war. Tensions within the Creek Nation increased during this period because the Confederacy tried to convince it and other Indian nations to tighten slave codes in Indian Territory.Zellar, Gary. African Creeks: Estelvste and the Creek Nation (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2007), p. 43 Creek with African ancestry resented the restrictions of proposed \\"black codes,\\" and became more affiliated toward the Union. Refugee enslaved African Americans, free people of color, Chickasaw and Seminole Indians also began gathering at Opothleyahola's plantation. They hoped to remain neutral in the conflict between the North and South. On August 15, 1861, Opothleyahola and tribal chief Micco Hutko contacted President Abraham Lincoln to request help for the loyalists. On September 10, they received a positive response, saying that the United States government would assist them. The letter directed Opothleyahola to move his people to Fort Row in Wilson County, Kansas, where they would receive asylum and aid.Woodson County history On November 15, Confederate Col. Douglas H. Cooper, a former US Indian Agent, led 1,400 men, including pro-Confederate Indians, northward; he intended either to convince Opothleyahola and his followers to support the Confederacy or to \\"drive him and his party from the country.\\" Believing Federal promises of assistance, Opothleyahola led his band (including Seminole under Halleck Tustenuggee) toward Kansas. Along the way, they had to fight three battles against their pursuers, and had lost many of their goods in their quick departure. At Round Mountain,On this date in Civil War history - \\"November 19, 1861 Battle of Round Mountain\\", This Week in the Civil War, 16 December 2011 Opothleyahola's forces drove back the Confederates to Fort Gibson. In December, the loyalists suffered a tactical loss at Chusto-TalasahOn this date in Civil War history - \\"December 9, 1861 - Battle of Chusto-Talasah\\" and a crushing defeat at the Battle of Chustenahlah. He lost an estimated 2,000 of his 9,000 followers from the battles, disease, and bitter winter blizzards during their ill-fated trek to Fort Row. The fort had been unable to get extra supplies, and lacked adequate medical support and supplies to care for the refugees. The Creek were forced to move to Fort Belmont, but conditions were still very poor. The majority of the Creek had only the clothes on their backs and lacked proper footwear and shelter, as they had left in a hurry. Many Creek died that winter, among them Opothleyahola's daughter.Official Records, Series 1, Volume 8, Part 1, pp. 5-12. Conditions for the Creek in Kansas continued to be very harsh. Opothleyahola died in the Creek refugee camp near the Sac and Fox Agency at Quenemo in Osage County, Kansas, on March 22, 1863. He was buried beside his daughter near Fort Belmont in Woodson County, Kansas.White, p. 297.

The scene in Holy Grail was written by Graham Chapman and John Cleese. The rabbit is the antagonist in a major set piece battle, and makes a similar appearance in Spamalot, a musical inspired by the movie. The iconic status of this scene was important in establishing the viability of the musical.  In the film  The Cave of Caerbannog is the home of the Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh (named for the last utterance of anyone who ever saw it). This is guarded by a monster which is initially unknown. King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights are led to the cave by Tim the Enchanter (John Cleese) and find that they must face its guardian beast. Tim verbally paints a picture of a monster so terrible as to have killed everyone who has tried to enter the cave, and warns them, \\"death awaits you all ‚Äì with nasty, big, pointy teeth!\\". As the knights approach the cave and the rabbit, their \\"horses\\" become nervous, forcing the knights to dismount. Sir Robin (Eric Idle) soils his armour upon merely seeing it, before everyone except Tim sizes it up as merely an innocuous white rabbit. Despite the cave's entrance being surrounded by the bones of \\"four-fifty men\\" fallen, Arthur and his knights no longer take it seriously. Ignoring Tim's warnings (\\"a vicious streak a mile wide!\\"), King Arthur orders Bors (Terry Gilliam) to chop the rabbit's head off. Bors draws his sword and confidently approaches it. The rabbit suddenly leaps at least eight feet directly at Sir Bors' neck and bites clean through it in a single motion, decapitating him to the sound of a can opener. Despite their initial shock, Sir Robin soiling his armour again, and Tim's loud scoffing, the knights attack in force, but the rabbit injures several of the knights and kills Gawain and Ector with ease. The knights themselves have no hope of killing or injuring the rabbit. Arthur panics and shouts for the knights to retreat (\\"Run away!\\"). Sir Robin asks if running away \\"more\\" would confuse it. Knowing they cannot risk attacking again, they try to find another way to defeat the beast. The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch is ultimately used to kill the rabbit and allow the quest to proceed. = Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch = The Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom, which The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch satirises The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch is a visual satire of the Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom, and may refer to the mythical Holy Spear of Antioch. The Holy Hand Grenade is described as one of the \\"sacred relics\\" carried by Brother Maynard (Idle). Despite its ornate appearance and long-winded instructions, it functions much the same as any other hand grenade. At King Arthur's prompting, instructions for its use are read aloud (by Michael Palin) from the fictitious Book of Armaments, Chapter 2, verses 9‚Äì21, parodying the King James Bible and the Athanasian Creed: Arthur then pulls the pin, holds up the Holy Hand Grenade and cries out \\"One! Two! Five!\\" Sir Galahad (Palin) corrects him: \\"Three, sir!\\" (Arthur's innumeracy is a running gag in the picture). Arthur then yells \\"Three!\\" and hurls the grenade towards the rabbit. The grenade soars through the air ‚Äì accompanied by a short bit of angelic choral a cappella ‚Äì bounces, and explodes. The killer rabbit is defeated, and the hapless knights errant continue on their quest. The noise also attracts policemen who were investigating the murder of a historian by a mounted knight earlier in the film.  Production  Tomnadashan copper mine The rabbit scene was shot outside the Tomnadashan mine, a cave 4 miles (6.5 km) from the Perthshire village of Killin. For the 25th anniversary DVD, Michael Palin and Terry Jones returned to be interviewed in front of the cave but they could not remember the location.\\"Python's Killer Rabbit Search is a Holy Farce\\", Alastair Dalton, Scotland on Sunday, 20 August 2000, Pg. 3 The rabbit was portrayed in the movie by both a real rabbit and a puppet. The name \\"Caerbannog\\", though fictitious, does reference real world Welsh naming traditions. In this case, the prefix \\"Caer-\\" implies the presence of a castle, as with Caerdydd (Cardiff) and Caerfyrddin (Carmarthen).  Antecedents  Notre Dame that gave inspiration The tale of the rabbit has a parallel in the early story of the Roman de Renart in which a foe takes hubristic pride in his defeat of a ferocious hare: : Si li crachait en mi le vis : Et escopi par grant vertuLe Roman de Renart, Ernest Martin, ed., vol. 2, Strasbourg: Trubner, 1887, p. 199 The idea for the rabbit in the movie was taken from the fa√ßade of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. This illustrates the weakness of cowardice by showing a knight fleeing from a rabbit.  Merchandise  The rabbit has been reproduced in the form of merchandise associated with the movie or musical. Such items include cuddly toys, slippers and staplers. The plush killer rabbit was rated the second geekiest plush toy of all time by Matt Blum of the GeekDad blog on Wired.com, coming second to the plush Cthulhu.  Reception  The rabbit was declared the top movie bunny by David Cheal in The Daily Telegraph. It also ranked high in an Easter 2008 poll to establish Britain's best movie rabbit, coming third to Roger Rabbit and Frank from Donnie Darko.  Cultural impact  The rabbit is now used as a metaphor for something which seems ostensibly harmless but is, in fact, deadly. Such hidden but real risks may even arise from similarly cuddly animals. The humour of the scene comes from this inversion of the usual framework by which safety and danger are judged. Four years after the release of the movie, Killer Rabbit was the term used widely by the press to describe the swamp rabbit that \\"attacked\\" then U.S. President Jimmy Carter while he was fishing on a farm pond. In Apple Inc.'s iOS system, Siri may say that the \\"Rabbit of Caerbannog\\" is its favorite animal when asked. Creatures & Treasures, a sourcebook for Iron Crown Enterprises' Rolemaster tabletop role-playing game, includes a \\"Killer Rabbit\\" monster entry. The creature's outlook is given as \\"Hostile\\", with a note that it \\"bounds for the throat, never for another part of the body.\\" Another note in the description instructs the gamemaster to \\"treat 'exploding' attacks [made against the rabbit] as 'slaying' (H.H.G.O.A.)\\", a clear reference to the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. In the video game Minecraft, there is a command that players can run that will spawn in the killer rabbit, or, as it is called in the game, \\"The Killer Bunny\\". In the video game Worms (series), there is a Holy Hand Grenade aka \\"Hallelujah Bomb\\" that players can use. A reference to the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch In the cellphone game Fate/Grand Order, it's revealed that Tristan jokes about Born's death, saying he died after being killed by a \\"dreaded vorpal bunny\\", and that it was held by Gawain, beaten by Lancelot, and kicked by Mordred. In the MMORPG Old School RuneScape, an NPC simply named \\"Rabbit\\" exists in the elven land of Prifddinas. The Rabbit's Design is clearly based on the Rabbit of Caerbannog and despite having a combat level of 2 it has 5000 hitpoints and can hit a player for up to 40 damage. This adds on to the numerous Monty Python easter eggs that exist within the game. The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch was seen in the 2018 movie Ready Player One used by the main character Wade Watts. In the video game series Wizardry, in the early titles, there is a monster called \\"Vorpal Bunny\\" which has a chance to decapitate upon a successful hit. In the video game Fallout: New Vegas, if the \\"Wild Wasteland\\" trait is picked during character creation, \\"Holy Frag Grenades\\" can be found in the basement of a church in Camp Searchlight, a plural and obvious reference to the Holy Hand Grenade, even with instructions written on a box beside these grenades reads \\"Pull pin and count to ~~5~~ 3\\" In the video game Dungeons of Dredmor, the Holy Hand Grenade is the second most powerful ranged area attack item in the game. The icon is identical to the grenade from the movie, and the flavor text on the item screen quotes Brother Maynard in the movie reading \\"O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade\\". The grenade does a huge amount of \\"righteous\\" type damage when thrown in a wave spreading out from the landing point in all directions for at least 5 squares so be careful where you are standing before using it! Multiple HHGs may be found or sometimes purchased at a throwing weapon vending machine in the late game. In the video game Dragon's Crown, a Killer Rabbit is fought as one of the stage bosses and as in the film is capable of killing the player in a single bite attack. Additional references include bombs being strewn around its lair as usable weapons (the Holy Hand Grenade), weak knights who will assist the player if the battle takes too long (King Arthur's men), and a wizard resembling John Cleese's character of Tim the Enchanter who warns the player of the danger ahead. Duke Nukem Time to Kill video game for the original Sony Playstation uses a weapon named literally the Holy Hand Grenade when you travel back in time to the Middle Ages in the game which does massive damage as well as bounces around homing in on enemies when thrown. When a Tesla Model 3 is named \\"the rabbit of Caerbannog\\" a link to the Monty Python YouTube channel in the Tesla Theatre will appear. In the video game Conan Exiles and Isle of Siptah expansion, there is a hidden Easter Egg that can be discovered by any player. By demolishing a specific large rock a Rabbit with glowing eyes can be found sitting in the middle of a pile of bones and skulls.

The company was based mainly in the city of Tampere. Until 1963 the company was called Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Osake-Yhti√∂ (The Flax and Iron Industry of Tampere Stock Company). In Swedish it was called Tammerfors Linne-&Jern-Manufakt.A.B..; In 1993 the company‚Äôs forest and packaging business was bought by Enso-Gutzeit Oy. Tampereen Pellava- ja Rautateollisuus Oy was a company based on the merger in 1861 of two factories - a linen mill and foundry - situated by the Tammerkoski rapids. After a modest start it grew to become an institution employing thousands of people in the centre of Tampere alone, and more in its other units. In the 1950s the company's name was shortened to Tampella. The company went into decline during the 1980s and eventually went bankrupt in 1990. This was at a time just before the economic recession of the early 1990s. After bankruptcy the company's operations were split and sold to various, mostly international, owners. Among the company's products was the manufacture of linen: in later times this was not an important product, but the company continued it for apparently historic reasons. However, its main concern was iron and steel products. These included grave crosses (in the very early days), guns, mining drills, paper machines, locomotives (both steam and diesel), steam boilers and turbines. The company also produced cardboard and packaging at its Inkeroinen mill. The industrial activity, under the new ownership, in the centre of Tampere gradually ceased and the machines finally stopped operating in 2000. Soon after this many of the buildings in the industrial complex have been taken into new uses as museums, cultural centres, artist's workshops etc. though some had already been demolished. Other buildings were converted to new commercial uses, but many were demolished to make way for blocks of flats. Together with an Israeli cooperative organisation Solel Boneh, Tampella also founded the Israeli defence contractor Soltam, in 1950.

He spent the season with the Dodgers' Triple-A team, the Las Vegas 51s, where he hit .297 and stole 26 bases. =Japan= In , a spring-training injury to the Dodgers' starting shortstop Rafael Furcal created an opening-day roster spot for Valdez and he got plenty of playing time early for the Dodgers. After a quick start, however, he quickly cooled and was returned to the 51s. On January 3, 2008, Valdez's contract was sold to the Kia Tigers of the Korea Baseball Organization. On June 9, he signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. =New York Mets= In December 2008, Valdez signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. On May 26, 2009, he was traded to the New York Mets and was added to the major league roster.

The Phillies selected his contract from the minors on April 14, 2010, as a reserve infielder, when Jimmy Rollins went on the disabled list. When backup Juan Castro was injured, Valdez became the Phillies' starting shortstop for a few weeks in the beginning of the season. On May 17, Rollins was activated from the disabled list (DL) and the Phillies designated Valdez for assignment, but re-activated him five days later when Rollins returned to the DL. In addition to playing shortstop, Valdez filled in at second base for Chase Utley while he was on the disabled list with a hand injury. On July 29, in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Valdez hit a one-out, walk-off single to score Cody Ransom from second base and give the Phillies a 3-2 win.Valdez the hero in Phils eighth straight win In 2010, Valdez set career highs in games, at bats, runs, hits, total bases, doubles, triples, home runs, runs batted in, bases on balls, intentional base on balls, strike outs, stolen bases, slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS). In a game started against the Cincinnati Reds on May 25, 2011, (which did not conclude until May 26), Valdez switched from second base to pitcher in the 19th inning, pitching one inning and allowing no runs. This was the first time he had ever pitched in a major league game. When the Phillies won in the bottom of the 19th inning, he was credited with the win. Valdez thus became the first position player to earn a win since catcher Brent Mayne won a game for the Colorado Rockies in 2000, and just the second since 1968. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Valdez was the first player to start a game in the field and end up as the winning pitcher since Babe Ruth did so on October 1, . =Cincinnati Reds= On January 25, 2012, Valdez was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for left handed pitcher Jeremy Horst.

The definition of \\"chill-out music\\" has evolved throughout the decades, and generally refers to anything that might be identified as a modern type of easy listening. Some of the genres associated with \\"chill\\" include downtempo, classical, dance, jazz, hip hop, world, pop, lounge, and ambient. The term \\"chill-out music\\" ‚Äì originally conflated with \\"ambient house\\" ‚Äì came from an area called \\"The White Room\\" at the Heaven nightclub in London in 1989. There, DJs played ambient mixes from sources such as Brian Eno and Pink Floyd to allow dancers a place to \\"chill out\\" from the faster-paced music of the main dance floor. Ambient house became widely popular over the next decade before it declined due to market saturation. In the early 2000s, DJs in Ibiza's Caf√© Del Mar began creating ambient house mixes that drew on jazz, classical, Hispanic, and New Age sources. The popularity of chill-out subsequently expanded to dedicated satellite radio channels, outdoor festivals, and thousands of compilation albums. \\"Chill-out\\" was also removed from its ambient origins and became its own distinct genre. \\"Chillwave\\" was an ironic term coined in 2009 for music that could already be described with existing labels such as dream pop. Despite the facetious intent behind the term, chillwave was the subject of serious, analytical articles by mainstream newspapers, and became one of the first genres to acquire an identity online. As on-demand music streaming services grew in the 2010s, a form of downtempo tagged as \\"lo- fi hip hop\\" or \\"chillhop\\" became popular among YouTube users. Origins and definition There is no exact definition of chill-out music. The term, which has evolved throughout the decades, generally refers to anything that might be identified as a modern type of easy listening. Some of the genres associated with \\"chill\\" include downtempo, classical, dance, jazz, hip hop, world, pop, lounge, and ambient. Chill-out typically has slow rhythms, sampling, a \\"trance-like nature\\", \\"drop-out beats\\", and a mixture of electronic instruments with acoustic instruments. In the \\"Ambient/Chill Out\\" chapter of Rick Snoman's 2013 book Dance Music Manual, he writes, \\"it could be said that as long as the tempo remains below 120 BPM and it employs a laid-back groove, it could be classed as chill out.\\" The Orb performing in 2006 The term originated from an area called \\"The White Room\\" at the Heaven nightclub in London in 1989. Its DJs were Jimmy Cauty and Alex Patterson, later of the Orb. They created ambient mixes from sources such as Brian Eno, Pink Floyd, the Eagles, Mike Oldfield, 10cc, and War. The room's purpose was to allow dancers a chance to \\"chill out\\" from the more emphatic and fast-tempo music played on the main dance floor. This also coincided with the short-lived fad of ambient house, also known as \\"New Age house\\". Cauty's KLF subsequently released an album called Chill Out (February 1990), featuring uncredited contributions from Patterson. In addition, during the early 1990s, the Beach Boys' Smiley Smile (1967) was reputed as one of the best \\"chill-out\\" albums to listen to during an LSD comedown. Ambient house declined after the mid-1990s due to market saturation. In the early 2000s, DJs in Ibiza's Caf√© Del Mar began creating ambient house mixes that drew on jazz, classical, Hispanic, and New Age sources. They called their product \\"chill-out music\\", and it sparked a revived interest in ambient house from the public and record labels. The popularity of chill-out subsequently expanded to dedicated satellite radio channels, outdoor festivals, and the release of thousands of compilation albums offering ambient sounds and \\"muffled\\" beats. Consequently, the popular understanding of \\"chill-out music\\" shifted away from \\"ambient\\" and into its own distinct genre. Music critics to that point were generally dismissive of the music. Chillwave In 2009, a genre called \\"chillwave\\" was invented by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff for music that could already be described with existing labels such as dream pop. The pseudonymous author, known as \\"Carles\\", later explained that he was only \\"[throwing] a bunch of pretty silly names on a blog post and saw which one stuck.\\" Chillwave became one of the first genres to acquire an identity online, although the term did not gain mainstream currency until early 2010, when it was the subject of serious, analytical articles by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. In 2011, Carles said it was \\"ridiculous that any sort of press took it seriously\\" and that although the bands he spoke to \\"get annoyed\\" by the tag, \\"they understand that it's been a good thing. What about iTunes making it an official genre? It's now theoretically a marketable indie sound.\\" Streaming =Spotify playlists= Streaming became the dominant source of music industry revenue in 2016. During that decade, Spotify engendered a trend that became known among the industry as \\"lean back listening\\", which refers to a listener who \\"thinks less about the artist or album they are seeking out, and instead connects with emotions, moods and activities\\". As of 2017, the front page of the service's \\"browse\\" screen included many algorithmically- selected playlists with names such as \\"Chilled Folk\\", \\"Chill Hits\\", \\"Evening Chill\\", \\"Chilled R&B;\\", \\"Indie Chillout\\", and \\"Chill Tracks\\". In 2014, the service reported that throughout the year \\"Chill Out\\" playlists had trended much higher than the national average on campuses across Colorado, where marijuana had been legalized in January of that year. In an editorial piece for The Baffler titled \\"The Problem with Muzak\\", writer Liz Pelly criticized the \\"chill\\" playlists as \\"the purest distillation of [Spotify's] ambition to turn all music into emotional wallpaper\\". =Chillhop= In 2013, YouTube began allowing its users to host live streams, which resulted in a host of 24-hour \\"radio stations\\" dedicated to microgenres such as vaporwave, a derivation of chillwave. Music streaming platform Spotify added to the popular \\"lo-fi beats\\" wave by generating \\"Spotified genres\\", including \\"Chill Hits\\", \\"Bedroom Pop\\" playlists, and promoting numerous \\"chill pop\\" artists. In 2017, a form of downtempo music tagged as \\"chillhop\\" or \\"lo-fi hip hop\\" became popular among YouTube music streamers. By 2018, several of these channels had attracted millions of followers. One DJ, Ryan Celsius, theorized that they were inspired by a nostalgia for the commercial bumpers used by Toonami and Adult Swim in the 2000s, and that this \\"created a cross section of people that enjoyed both anime and wavy hip-hop beats.\\" These channels equally functioned as chatrooms, with participants often discussing their personal struggles. As of 2018, Spotify's \\"Chill Hits\\" playlist had 5.4 million listeners and had been growing rapidly. Chillhop became one of the most widely known microgenres and may also be viewed as chill-out music fused with hip-hop. Nujabes and J Dilla have been referred to as the \\"godfathers of Lo-Fi Hip Hop\\". Vice contributor Luke Winkie credited YouTube user ChilledCow as \\"the person who first featured a studious anime girl as his calling card, which set up the aesthetic framework for the rest of the people operating in the genre\\" and suggested that \\"if there is one shared touchstone for lo-fi hip-hop, it's probably [the 2004 MF Doom and Madlib album] Madvillainy\\". Some YouTube streams, including those by Chillhop Records and ChilledCow, faced issues such as copyright strikes and bans. In February 2018, Chillhop Records received a copyright strike from anime house Studio Chizu for the use of a character from the feature film, Wolf Children. Though Chillhop Records only used a five- second loop of one character, the popularity of the video caught the attention of Studio Chizu. The founder of Chillhop Records and owner of the YouTube channel, Bas Van Leeuwen told the gaming magazine, Polygon, that the company worked with Studio Chizu in order to bring the livestream back on. ChilledCow received another notice from YouTube, in February 2020, detailing that the channel had violated YouTube's Terms of Service. According to The Fader, soon after the shutdown of ChilledCow's channel, a large influx of support from fans of the longstanding lo-fi curator was recognized as the reason why the popular lo-fi hip hop livestream was resumed after the mishap. Viewership of lo-fi hip hop streams grew significantly during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. In April, MTV News noted, \\"there might be something to be said for lo-fi hip- hop‚Äôs composition, and the way its creators mix simplistic melodies with a judicious use of words to create intense memories, feelings, and nostalgia\\" and stated that the quarantine in place in various countries \\"has led people to log more hours online due to boredom or virtual workplaces and schools, and livestreamed music performances are reaching their full potential.\\" Lo-fi hip hop is considered an Internet meme. Many producers in the genre later distanced themselves from the label or drifted into other music styles. Common criticisms of the genre included the music's simplicity and clich√©d sound.

The radical axis (or power line) of two non-concentric circles is a line defined by the two circles, perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the circles. If the circles cross, their radical axis is the line through their two crossing points, and if they are tangent, it is their line of tangency. For two disjoint circles, the radical axis is the locus of points at which tangents drawn to both circles have equal lengths. The radical axis is always a straight line and always perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the circles. For any point P on the radical axis, there is a unique circle centered on P that intersects both circles at right angles (orthogonally); conversely, the center of any circle that cuts both circles orthogonally must lie on the radical axis. In technical language, each point P on the radical axis has the same power with respect to both circlesJohnson (1960), pp. 31-32. : R^{2} = d_{1}^{2} - r_{1}^{2} = d_{2}^{2} - r_{2}^{2} where r1 and r2 are the radii of the two circles, d1 and d2 are distances from P to the centers of the two circles, and R is the radius of the unique orthogonal circle centered on P. In general, two disjoint, non-concentric circles can be aligned with the circles of bipolar coordinates; in that case, the radical axis is simply the y-axis; every circle on that axis that passes through the two foci intersect the two circles orthogonally. Thus, two radii of such a circle are tangent to both circles, satisfying the definition of the radical axis. The collection of all circles with the same radical axis and with centers on the same line is known as a pencil of coaxal circles. Definition and general properties If the two circles intersect, the radical axis is the secant line corresponding to their common chord. Figure 2: The radical center (orange point) is the center of the unique circle (also orange) that intersects three given circles at right angles. Radical center of three circles Consider three circles A, B and C, no two of which are concentric. The radical axis theorem states that the three radical axes (for each pair of circles) intersect in one point called the radical center, or are parallel.Johnson (1960), pp. 32-33. In technical language, the three radical axes are concurrent (share a common point); if they are parallel, they concur at a point of infinity. A simple proof is as follows.Johnson (1960), p. 32. The radical axis of circles A and B is defined as the line along which the tangents to those circles are equal in length a=b. Similarly, the tangents to circles B and C must be equal in length on their radical axis. By the transitivity of equality, all three tangents are equal a=b=c at the intersection point r of those two radical axes. Hence, the radical axis for circles A and C must pass through the same point r, since a=c there. This common intersection point r is the radical center. There is a unique circle with its center at the radical center that is orthogonal to all three circles. This follows, also by transitivity, because each radical axis, being the locus of centers of circles that cut each pair of given circles orthogonally, requires all three circles to have equal radius at the intersection of all three axes. Geometric construction Radical Axis Construction The radical axis of two circles A and B can be constructed by drawing a line through any two points on the axis. A point on the axis can be found by drawing a circle C that intersects both circles A and B in two points. The two lines passing through each pair of intersection points are the radical axes of A and C and of B and C. These two lines intersect in a point J that is the radical center of all three circles, as described above; therefore, this point also lies on the radical axis of A and B. Repeating this process with another such circle D provides a second point K. The radical axis is the line passing through both J and K. Figure 3: Lines through corresponding antihomologous points intersect on the radical axis of the two given circles (green and blue, centered on points C and D, respectively). The points P and Q are antihomologous, as are S and T. These four points lie on a circle that intersects the two given circles. A special case of this approach, seen in Figure 3, is carried out with antihomologous points from an internal or external center of similarity. Consider two rays emanating from an external homothetic center E. Let the antihomologous pairs of intersection points of these rays with the two given circles be denoted as P and Q, and S and T, respectively. These four points lie on a common circle that intersects the two given circles in two points each.Johnson (1960), pp. 20-21. Hence, the two lines joining P and S, and Q and T intersect at the radical center of the three circles, which lies on the radical axis of the given circles.Johnson (1960), p. 41. Similarly, the line joining two antihomologous points on separate circles and their tangents form an isosceles triangle, with both tangents being of equal length.Johnson (1960), p. 21. Therefore, such tangents meet on the radical axis. Algebraic construction Figure 4: Finding the radical axis algebraically. L is the distance from J to K, whereas x1 and x2 are the distances from K to B and from K to V, respectively. The variables d1 and d2 represent the distances from J to B and from J to V, respectively. Referring to Figure 4, the radical axis (red) is perpendicular to the blue line segment joining the centers B and V of the two given circles, intersecting that line segment at a point K between the two circles. Therefore, it suffices to find the distance x1 or x2 from K to B or V, respectively, where x1+x2 equals D, the distance between B and V. Consider a point J on the radical axis, and let its distances to B and V be denoted as d1 and d2, respectively. Since J must have the same power with respect to both circles, it follows that : d_{1}^{2} - r_{1}^{2} = d_{2}^{2} - r_{2}^{2} where r1 and r2 are the radii of the two given circles. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distances d1 and d2 can be expressed in terms of x1, x2 and L, the distance from J to K : L^{2} + x_{1}^{2} - r_{1}^{2} = L^{2} + x_{2}^{2} - r_{2}^{2} By cancelling L2 on both sides of the equation, the equation can be written : x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2} = r_{1}^{2} - r_{2}^{2} Dividing both sides by D = x1+x2 yields the equation : x_{1} - x_{2} = \\\\frac{r_{1}^{2} - r_{2}^{2}}{D} Adding this equation to x1+x2 = D yields a formula for x1 : 2x_{1} = D + \\\\frac{r_{1}^{2} - r_{2}^{2}}{D} Subtracting the same equation yields the corresponding formula for x2 : 2x_{2} = D - \\\\frac{r_{1}^{2} - r_{2}^{2}}{D} Determinant calculation If the circles are represented in trilinear coordinates in the usual way, then their radical center is conveniently given as a certain determinant. Specifically, let X = x : y : z denote a variable point in the plane of a triangle ABC with sidelengths a = BC, b = CA, c = AB, and represent the circles as follows: :(dx + ey + fz)(ax + by + cz) + g(ayz + bzx + cxy) = 0 :(hx + iy + jz)(ax + by + cz) + k(ayz + bzx + cxy) = 0 :(lx + my + nz)(ax + by + cz) + p(ayz + bzx + cxy) = 0 Then the radical center is the point : \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix}g&k;&p; e&i;&m;f&j;&n;\\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix}g&k;&p; f&j;&n;d&h;&l;\\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix}g&k;&p; d&h;&l;e&i;&m;\\\\end{bmatrix}. Radical plane and hyperplane The radical plane of two nonconcentric spheres in three dimensions is defined similarly: it is the locus of points from which tangents to the two spheres have the same length.See Merriam‚ÄìWebster online dictionary. The fact that this locus is a plane follows by rotation in the third dimension from the fact that the radical axis is a straight line. The same definition can be applied to hyperspheres in Euclidean space of any dimension, giving the radical hyperplane of two nonconcentric hyperspheres.

Hittorf was the first to compute the electricity-carrying capacity of charged atoms and molecules (ions), an important factor in understanding electrochemical reactions. He formulated ion transport numbers and the first method for their measurements. He observed tubes with energy rays extending from a negative electrode. These rays produced a fluorescence when they hit the glass walls of the tubes. In 1876 the effect was named \\"cathode rays\\" by Eugen Goldstein. Hittorf's early investigations were on the allotropes of phosphorus and selenium. Between 1853 and 1859 his most important work was on ion movement caused by electric current. In 1853 Hittorf pointed out that some ions traveled more rapidly than others. This observation led to the concept of transport number, the fraction of the electric current carried by each ionic species. He measured the changes in the concentration of electrolyzed solutions, computed from these the transport numbers (relative carrying capacities) of many ions, and, in 1869, published his laws governing the migration of ions. He became professor of physics and chemistry at the University of M√ºnster and director of laboratories there from 1879 until 1889. He also investigated the light spectra of gases and vapours, worked on the passage of electricity through gases, and discovered new properties of cathode rays (electron rays). In 1869 he ascertained that the cathode rays glowed different colours because of different gasses and pressures. He noticed that when there was any object placed between the cathode and the illuminating side of the tube, then the shadow of that object appeared. His work led toward development of X-rays and cathode ray tubes. The measurement of current in a vacuum tube was an important step towards the creation of a vacuum tube diode.

He worked with the Pete Lemer Quintet, Spontaneous Music Ensemble, Annette Peacock, Harry Beckett, Gilgamesh, Baker Gurvitz Army, Seventh Wave, Harry Beckett's Joy Unlimited, Pierre Moerlen's Gong, Mike Oldfield Group, In Cahoots, Miller/Baker/Lemer. He currently works with In Cahoots, Peter Lemer Trio/Quartet, Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia, and the Peter Lemer-Billy Thompson Quartet and Duo. Early life and education Peter Lemer was born in London, England. He studied piano and composition at the Royal Academy of Music with Sven Weber and John Gardner, privately with Thomas Rajna, and then at workshops in London run by Jack Goldzweig (who had himself co-coached in New York with Mal Waldron and John Mehegan). Lemer then went to New York to study double bass with David Walter, attended workshops run by Bill Dixon, and studied piano with Jaki Byard and Paul Bley. Career In 1965, he formed a trio with John Stevens and Jeff Clyne, which opened the Little Theatre Club. In 1966, he formed the Peter Lemer Quintet, with Jon Hiseman on drums, George Khan on tenor sax, John Surman on baritone sax and Tony Reeves on bass. This band successfully played a season at Ronnie Scott's and helped to pave the way for the British free jazz movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, along with the Mike Taylor trio. It cut one LP, Local Colour which was engineered by Eddie Kramer. In 1969, Lemer worked with the Spontaneous Music Ensemble, an experimental jazz group. In that year, he also joined Barbara Thompson. The relationship developed into Barbara forming Paraphernalia with husband Jon Hiseman. Paraphernalia became the most frequently performing jazz-oriented group in Europe, and Peter was keyboardist for most of the years right up to the present, including 10 albums recorded live or at Barbara and Jon's Temple Music Studios. In 1974, Lemer joined Gilgamesh and played several gigs and some BBC sessions. He subsequently became an in-demand session player. In 1974, he joined Ken Elliot's Seventh Wave, a pioneer synthesiser-based rock band, appearing on their second album, Psi-Fi. In 1975, he joined Ginger Baker, Mr Snips, and The Gurvitz brothers in the Baker Gurvitz Army - recording Elysian Encounter . In 1976, he joined Jan Dukes de Grey briefly to record their final album, Strange Terrain. Although the album was recorded in 1976, it was only released in 2010. In 1979, Lemer joined Mike Oldfield's fifty piece touring band as one of two keyboard players. This led to him guesting on Moerlen's album Time is the Key. Lemer has done much recent work with the band In Cahoots. With them, he played on the album Cutting Both Ways (1987) and toured Europe. He joined the band Paraphernalia in 1987 and played on the albums A Cry from the Heart (1987), Everlasting Flame (1993) and Shifting Sands. Lemer again worked with In Cahoots. He played on the album Digging In (1991) and rejoined the band permanently in 1995. After two In Cahoots tours, Lemer devoted 1999 to touring with Paraphernalia in support of the album they had recently released. Paraphernalia is not currently touring while Barbara Thompson is fighting Parkinson's Disease. Lemer's most recent albums include Players of Games recorded with Billy Thompson, Looking for Soup, All That with In Cahoots, and Never Say Goodbye recorded with Paraphernalia. Present He is now coaching piano, improvisation, music technology. He also plays with the Spanish Harlow Orchestra.

His most recent job was as manager of Drogheda United. Richardson formerly managed Gillingham in England and Cobh Ramblers, Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers in Ireland. He is also known for his media work, including Monday Night Soccer. Player As a player Richardson's career was divided between Shamrock Rovers and Gillingham. He made his Rovers debut in a 2‚Äì1 friendly win over Sunderland at Roker Park on 10 August 1963. His competitive debut came eight days later as Rovers beat Shelbourne 3‚Äì0 at Tolka Park in a Dublin City Cup clash. While at Rovers he twice won the FAI Cup in 1968 and 1969 (scoring in the final replay) as well as getting an Inter League cap and represented the club 5 times in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup. He received the first of three international caps for the Irish national team while at Shamrock Rovers, making his debut against Austria in Linz in October 1971. He scored in his final appearance for Rovers on 22 October 1972 at Milltown. He moved to the English Fourth Division side Gillingham at the age of 25. He played for the Priestfield Stadium side for the next nine years before being released in 1981. During his time there he scored 100 goals. Manager Richardson's managerial career began in 1989 where he managed Gillingham, having previously served as the club's youth team manager. A rather lacklustre career there ended in 1992, and he returned to Ireland in 1993 to manage Cork City. He proved an instant success bringing the club within striking distance of retaining the league title. However, after 18 months he left the club after a dispute with then chairman Pat O'Donovan. Following Cork City, he moved on another Cork side Cobh Ramblers before taking up the management position at Shelbourne. His time at Shelbourne saw two Cup successes (1995‚Äì96 and 1996‚Äì97), one League of Ireland Cup (1995‚Äì96) and a runner up position in the League (1997‚Äì98) in three seasons. His failure to win the league ultimately cost him his job. He moved to his old club Shamrock Rovers, where his tenure for three seasons failed to result in a trophy. Ultimately, Richardson and club chairman Joe Colwell disagreed on the direction of the club, and parted ways in April 2002. Colwell wanted to focus on building a new stadium for the club, while Richardson wanted to focus on a full-time panel of players. In 2005 Richardson returned to League of Ireland management when Cork City's manager Pat Dolan was dramatically sacked before the start of pre-season friendlies. Cork City chairman Brian Lennox signed the 57-year-old Richardson to a two-year contract at Turners Cross 15 days before the first competitive match of the season. Richardson commented that the Cork City job was the only one that could have brought him back to League of Ireland management. Despite being hospitalised in September in his first season in charge Cork City were crowned League of Ireland champions for the second time in the club's history. Cork City also reached the final of the FAI Cup but were defeated by Drogheda United. The 2006 and 2007 seasons saw 4th- place positions for his club in both years. In 2007 Richardson led Cork City to FAI Cup victory, but left shortly afterwards following some controversy, and a financial settlement agreement. In 2010 Damien was selected by the FAI to manage a League of Ireland XI to play a full-strength Manchester United side in the opening match of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Again in 2011 he was selected by the FAI to manage a League of Ireland XI to play in the Dublin Super Cup at the Aviva Stadium. Richardson was named as the manager of Drogheda United on 26 July 2014 for the remainder of their league campaign. Media work In 2002, Richardson left football management to become a TV soccer pundit with TV3 in Ireland, before returning to the game in 2005. He is now a regular pundit on Monday Night Soccer on Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann, and is also a regular contributor to RT√â Radio's coverage of Republic of Ireland international matches. He contributed to RT√â Sport's coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Richardson writes a regular blog for the RT√â / MNS website, and continues to write a weekly column for a Cork newspaper since his time as manager of Cork City. Richardson has also supported Red FM's national award- winning \\"Break the Cycle\\" anti-speeding campaign. In addition to his media work, he occasionally teaches football team management seminars. Richardson also once played the bodhran on an album (A Kentish Garland) by Tundra, a folk music group from Kent.

It was a development of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation in an effort to introduce the best features found in European fighter aircraft in 1939 into a fighter aircraft which could succeed the Curtiss P-40, then in production. Design and development A United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) specification based upon a Curtiss proposal was the basis for an order placed in September 1939 for the XP-46. The requirements called for a single-engine, low-wing aircraft, slightly smaller than the P-40, and with a wide-track, inward-retracting landing gear. The selected powerplant was a 1,150 hp (858 kW) Allison V-1710-39 V-12 engine. The planned armament included two .50 in (12.7 mm) synchronized machine guns in the forward fuselage and provisions for eight .30 in (7.62 mm) wing-mounted guns. The USAAC later added requirements for self-sealing fuel tanks and 65 lb (29 kg) of armor, the weights of which were to adversely affect performance. Testing In 1940 the British Purchasing Commission placed an order for the P-46 as a replacement for the P-40,Engel, Leonard. \\"Half of Everything: An American's Survey of Orders Placed in the United States.\\" Flight, 5 December 1940, p. 472. the name 'Kittyhawk' being allocated by the Air Ministry in anticipation of receiving the aircraft.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1941/1941%20-%201120.html However, the USAAC asked Curtiss in July 1940 ‚Äì while the XP-46 prototypes were under construction ‚Äì to prioritize an upgraded P-40, featuring the engine intended for the XP-46. This would also avoid disruptions to the production line caused by any switch to a new airframe. The British order for the P-46 was later cancelled, and the 'Kittyhawk' name subsequently applied to the upgraded P-40. Two prototypes, designated XP-46A, were nevertheless delivered to the USAAC; the first flight occurred on 15 February 1941. The type's performance during trials was found to be inferior to the then-contemporary P-40D. As the P-46 offered no significant improvement on the P-40, the program was cancelled.Berliner 2011, p. 18. A myth claims that work on the XP-46 was the basis of the North American NA-73X ‚Äì the prototype P-51 Mustang. While North American Aviation (NAA) purchased technical aerodynamic data on the P-40 and XP-46 from Curtiss for $56,000, and there are certain design similarities in the radiator/oil-cooler configuration of the two types, North American had already made significant progress on its design.Baugher, Joe. \\"North American NA-73.\\" USAAC/USAAF/USAF Fighter and Pursuit Aircraft: North American P-51 Mustang, 29 August 1999.

The show featured a series of five location-specific challenges along a New York-to-Los Angeles course, as in the original race. Development of the series started without the participation of Brock Yates, organizer of the original Cannonball and holder of the trademark; indeed, the production company paid Yates for the use of the name just before the show debuted. Yates was not pleased with the series, as he felt it was fake and staged. In 2005, Yates teamed up with a Cannonball driver and film producer J Sanchez to produce a more authentic reality series called Cannonball: This Is Reality to run alongside the actual One Lap of America race. The project was shelved in 2006 due to lack of interest from networks.

It was the first successful anti-tank weapon of its type, being a successor to the earlier and unsuccessful RPG-1. The RPG-2 offered better range and armor penetration, making it useful against late and post-World War II tanks, in contrast to the RPG-1 that had only marginal utility. The basic design and layout was further upgraded to produce the ubiquitous RPG-7. History Studying German and US anti-tank rocket designs, in 1944 the Soviets began development of the RPG-1 with the goal of combining the best features of the German Panzerfaust with the US Bazooka. Propelled by a 30 mm cartridge, the HEAT round could penetrate about of homogeneous armour. Early testing displayed a number of minor problems, but, by the time these were being solved, the 150 mm of penetration was no longer considered effective against modern tanks, even late-war designs like the Panther. The warhead was already straining the capabilities of the cartridge and its range was already considered too low. Modifications to improve this began, but in 1947 the RPG-2 program started as a parallel project. Development of the RPG-2 was carried out by the GSKB-30 design bureau, originally part of the Commissariat for Munitions, but in the post-war period handed to the Ministry of Agriculture to help design farm equipment. The main difference in performance between the two were due to size. The RPG-2 used a custom designed cartridge to provide much greater power, and the warhead enlarged to . This improved penetration to , which allowed it to penetrate the frontal armor of all but very heaviest tanks, and the side and rear armor of any tank. The larger cartridge gave the PG-2 warhead slightly better practical range as well, about against stationary targets. The design of the PG-2 differed considerably from that of the PG-1 of the RPG-1. The rear section of the PG-1 consisted of a central tube holding the propelling charge, and a second tube around this carrying the fins. When the round was inserted into the launcher, the second tube was outside the launcher tube, requiring the front of the launcher to be free of any fittings. The PG-2 replaced the fins with small metal leaves attached to the inner tube, and eliminated the outer tube found on the PG-1. This allowed the entire propellant section to be inserted into the launcher, which in turn allowed the sights and trigger assembly to be mounted right at the front of the launcher. This slightly reduced the length compared to the RPG-1, made the entire assembly more robust, and allowed the use of conventional fore-and-aft sights. The new design was such an improvement on the earlier design that development of the RPG-1 ended in 1948. The first production versions of the RPG-2 entered service with the Soviet Army's infantry squads in 1954. Although the RPG-2 could be operated by one man, standard military practice called for a two-man crew: a grenadier carrying the launcher and a purpose-built backpack containing three grenades and an assistant armed with a rifle and carrying another three-grenade backpack. In 1957, the launcher was adapted to be able to mount the NSP-2 infrared (IR) night-sight system, which consisted of an IR spotlight and a detector, together weighing (with batteries) . The NSP-2 was usable to under good conditions. When fitted with the NSP-2, the launcher became known as the RPG-2N. Widely distributed to allies of the Soviet Union, it was also produced under license by China, North Vietnam and North Korea. Used against the U.S. military in the Vietnam War, its Vietnamese variants were called the B40 (Ba Do Ka (Bazooka) 40mm) and B50. B50 was B40 using Chinese Type 50 HEAT warhead (Chinese version of PG-2). Polish soldier with an RPG-2 launcher. Design PG-2 HEAT projectile The RPG-2 anti tank grenade launcher is a simple 40 millimeter steel tubehttp://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Weapons_ID_DB/SAS_weapons- rocket-launchers-RPG2.pdf into which the PG-2 grenade is fitted. The tailboom of the grenade inserts into the launcher. The diameter of the PG-2 warhead is 80mm. The center section of the tube has a thin wooden covering to protect the user from the heat generated by the grenade launch. The wooden covering also makes using the weapon in extreme cold conditions easier. The total length of the weapon with a grenade fitted was 120 centimeters (47 inches) and it weighed 4.48 kilograms (9.8 pounds). Only a simple iron sight was provided for aiming. Only one type of grenade, the PG-2 HEAT (High Explosive Anti-Tank), was used in the RPG-2. The propellant, consisting of granulated powder was in a rolled cardboard case treated with wax that had to be attached to the grenade before loading. Once attached to the propellant charge, the grenade was inserted into the smooth-bore launcher from the front. A tab on the body of the grenade indexes in a notch cut in the tube so that the primer in the propelling charge aligns with the firing pin and hammer mechanism. To fire the RPG-2, the grenadier cocked an external hammer with his thumb, aimed, and pulled the trigger to fire. Upon launch, six stabilizer fins unfolded from the grenade. The weapon was accurate, depending on the soldier's experience, against stationary targets up to 150 meters and against moving targets at ranges of less than 100 meters. It had a muzzle velocity of 84 meters per second and could penetrate armor up to 180 millimeters (7.17 inches) thick.

He was a member of the State Duma of Russia between 2003 and 2007, and stood for President in the 2004 Russian presidential election. Born on April 7, 1951 in the Rostov Oblast of the Russian SFSR, Malyshkin graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in Novocherkassk as a mining engineer. He was a professional boxer (12 wins by knock-outs) and soccer player. As soccer defender he competed for Torpedo Taganrog, Uralan and some clubs from Rostov-on-Don mainly in Soviet Second League. He entered politics in 1991 as a member of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and working in the party offices in Moscow. In 1997, he won election as head of the Tatsinsky District in Rostov Oblast and served until 2001. He governed the district in an authoritarian, statist manner, introducing strict price controls for food and visiting the grain elevator accompanied by armed guards in order to resolve a dispute between the enterprise and his administration. In 2001, Malyshkin returned to Moscow and resumed his post in the LDPR's head office, becoming Chief of Staff to Vladimir Zhirinovsky's security and being nominated as Vice Chairman of the party. In 2003, he was elected to the State Duma. He quickly established himself as just as fiery and hot-headed as his party's leader, assaulting former economic adviser to prime minister Mikhail Delyagin and Yabloko deputy chairman Sergey Mitrokhin on November 21, 2003. He serves on the State Duma's Committee on Defense. Presidential campaign Malyshkin was a surprise choice for the LDPR's candidate in the Russian presidential election of 2004, as he was barely known outside Tatsinsky District and LDPR circles. However, it was widely assumed that Zhirinovsky chose not to run in this election as he realised it would be impossible for him to beat Vladimir Putin. Malyshkin made much of his credentials as a worker in the election, but found it difficult to be taken seriously as a candidate, particularly after his mother said she would not be voting for her son. Malyshkin also said throughout the campaign that, should he win, he would automatically step aside for LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Malyshkin won 1,393,940 votes, for 2% of the poll, coming fifth out of six candidates. Zhirinovsky had originally plan to run himself, having announced his intent to run in December 2003. However, he ultimately did not run. As a presidential candidate Malyshkin acquired a reputation in which he was seen as being unintelligent. After presidential campaign In April 2007 Vladimir Zhirinovsky announced that Malyshkin had been expelled from the LDPR's Duma faction for refusing to participate in regional elections in Russia the previous month. He did not run for re- election in December 2007.

The film was released in the United States on January 18, 2002, by Walt Disney Pictures. The film is inspired by the book, Winterdance, by Gary Paulsen. Plot Dr. Theodore \\"Ted\\" Brooks is a celebrity dentist in Miami, Florida. Every city bus carries an advertisement for his dental practice \\"Hot Smile\\" with his picture. One day, Ted receives a letter from Alaska, naming him as the only heir of Lucy Watkins, a resident of the backwoods village of Tolketna. Ted's mother Amelia reveals that he is adopted; Lucy was his biological mother. Ted travels to Tolketna to claim his inheritance from Lucy: seven Siberian Huskies named Diesel, Mack, Sniff, Yodel, Scooper, Duchess and Demon, and a Border Collie named Nana. Completely out of his element, Ted is confounded by blizzards, thin ice, foxes, skunks, grizzly bears, an intimidating, crusty old mountain man named James \\"Thunder Jack\\" Johnson, and the aggressive, defiant lead dog, Demon. All of this happens with the buzzing excitement of the Arctic Challenge Sled Dog Race, which is only two weeks away. Ted tries to find out why he was given up for adoption, and who was his biological father. He meets bar owner Barb, a close friend of Lucy. Barb helps Ted to deal with the dogs and teaches him how to drive a sled, and the two fall in love. Ted has several encounters with Thunder Jack, who tries to buy the dogs, especially Demon. Barb reveals to Ted that Thunder Jack is his biological father. Ted confronts Jack, who initially denies the claims. When Ted loses consciousness while practicing sledding, Jack rescues him and takes him to a cave. Jack offers to reveal the truth in exchange for the dogs; Ted agrees. Jack claims that he and Lucy hid from a storm in the same cave during an Arctic Challenge, and it was then that Ted was conceived. When Jack woke up, Lucy was gone. He looked for her but never found her. Ted lets Jack have the dogs and returns to Miami. Jack adds Demon as lead dog of his team for the Arctic Challenge. When the race begins, Jack decides to press on in the middle of a fierce storm. In Miami, Ted recounts his experiences to his mother, who accidentally breaks a frame holding a picture of Lucy and Demon. Inside of the frame is a snapshot of Lucy and Jack with a baby. Ted is infuriated that Jack lied to him, and rushes back to Alaska. He learns that Jack has gone missing and the weather is too bad for searching. Ted decides to search for Jack himself, taking Lucy's dogs with Nana as lead. A few hours later, Amelia arrives and meets Barb. She learns that Ted is out on the trail, searching for Jack. The \\"Arctic Flame\\" is burning over the finish line, until the last musher arrives. Ted eventually locates Jack in the old cave. Jack admits he and Lucy had been together at the hospital when Ted was born, and that he loved her very much; but that he and Lucy had agreed then that neither one of them were ready to be parents. Ted also discovers that Demon's bad temper is due to a rotten tooth. He pulls the tooth, and Demon becomes a much friendlier dog. During the journey back to Tolketna, the sled nearly goes over a cliff into a river, but the dogs pull themselves back up. Ted finally brings Thunder Jack across the finish line. Ted introduces Jack to Amelia, and he and Jack decide to share the \\"Arctic Flame\\" trophy, which is given to whoever comes in last. Some time later, Ted has moved his dental practice to Tolketna.

The objective is for the male to carry the female through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The sport was first introduced at Sonkaj√§rvi, Finland. Several types of carrying may be practised: either a classic piggyback, a fireman's carry (over the shoulder), or Estonian-style (wife upside-down on his back with her legs over the neck and shoulders). History Eukonkanto originated in Finland. Tales have been passed down of a man named Herkko Rosvo-Ronkainen (aka Ronkainen the RobberWife-carrying is a thing in Finland, SCMP, 8 July 2018). This man was considered a robber in the late 1800s, lived in a forest, and ran around with his gang of thieves causing harm to the villages. From what has been found, there are three ideas as to why/how this sport was invented. Firstly, that Rosvo-Ronkainen and his thieves were accused of stealing food and women from villages in the area he lived in, then carrying these women on their backs as they ran away (hence the \\"wife\\" or woman carrying). The second suggestion is that young men would go to neighbouring villages, steal other men‚Äôs wives to marry themselves. These wives were also carried on the backs of the young men; this was referred to as ‚Äúthe practice of wife stealing\\". Lastly, is the idea that Rosvo-Ronkainen trained his thieves to be \\"faster and stronger\\" by carrying big, heavy sacks on their backs, from which evolved this sport. Though the sport is often considered a joke, competitors take it very seriously, just like any other sport. Wife carrying contests have taken place in Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, India, Germany, the UK and other parts of the world besides Finland and nearby Sweden, Estonia and Latvia, and the sport has a category in the Guinness Book of Records.  Rules  The original course was a rough, rocky terrain with fences and brooks, but it has been altered to suit modern conditions. There is now sand instead of full rocks, fences, and some kind of area filled with water (a pool). These are the following rules set by the International Wife Carrying Competition Rules Committee: * The length of the official track is 253.5 metres. * The track has two dry obstacles and a water obstacle about one metre deep. * The wife to be carried may be your own, or the neighbour's, or you may have found her further afield; she must, however, be over 17 years of age. * The minimum weight of the wife to be carried is 49 kilograms. If she weighs less than 49 kg, she will be burdened with a rucksack containing additional weight to bring the total load to be carried up to 49 kg. * All participants must enjoy themselves. * The only equipment allowed is a belt worn by the carrier and a helmet worn by the carried. * The contestants run the race two pairs at a time, so each heat is a contest in itself. * Each contestant takes care of his/her safety and, if deemed necessary, insurance. * The contestants have to pay attention to the instructions given by the organizers of the competition. * There is only one category in the World Championships, and the winner is the couple who completes the course in the shortest time. * Also, the most entertaining couple, the best costume, and the strongest carrier will be awarded a special prize. While the International rules are the basis for all competitions, rules and prizes do vary for each competition. The Wife Carrying World Championships have been held annually in Sonkaj√§rvi, Finland, since 1992 (where the prize is the wife's weight in beer).

It is no longer paid in England. It applies to those doing, or applying to do, at least 12 hours of guided learning on further education courses in school sixth forms, sixth form colleges and Further Education colleges. This includes a wide range of courses up to and including level 3, such as A-levels, GCSEs, BTECs GNVQs, NVQs and other vocational qualifications. Those partaking in an Entry to Employment (E2E course, formerly known as Work based Learning) must do at least 16 hours a week of guided study. Any missed lessons except for extenuating circumstances voids payment for that week. In 2010 the weekly payment for the England scheme were: *¬£30 per week for those whose household income is under ¬£20,817 p.a.; *¬£20 per week for those whose household income is between ¬£20,818 and ¬£25,521 p.a.; *¬£10 per week for those whose household income is between ¬£25,522 and ¬£30,810 p.a. In Scotland a flat rate of ¬£30/week per student is payable where assessed income is ¬£20,351 or less (or ¬£22,403 where there is more than one child in the household). Benefits The Labour Party claimed the EMA scheme was of great benefit to those teenagers from low-income households, encouraging people to stay in education past the legally required age of 16 (end of year 11; fourth year in Scotland, and year 12 in Northern Ireland). Once in education it encouraged high attendance in return for bonuses. A 2006 BBC report suggested that even with the EMA, parents earning less than ¬£30,000 a year still struggle to support teenagers enough to enable them to stay in education past 16.BBC NEWS  Education  Parents struggle on teens' needs In tests done by 56 of the 150 English local education authorities in 2004, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Loughborough University found staying-on rates improved up 5.9 percentage points among those who were eligible.\\"Q&A;: Payment for study\\", BBC News, 19 April 2004. Retrieved 27 June 2006. This effect was most pronounced amongst boys whose parents were unemployed or employed in unskilled or semi-skilled manual jobs, the group with lowest stay-on rates, and arguably facing the most social pressure to earn money and peer pressure that education is unimportant. Opposition Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative party stated opposition to EMA while in opposition.BBC NEWS  Education  Students get ¬£100 bonus payment Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis, said: \\"There are significantly more important things to do with ¬£20m than give young people a Christmas bonus.\\"BBC NEWS  Education  Students get ¬£100 bonus payment Conservative Party spokesman Chris Grayling said: \\"This is another blatant example of the government trying to fiddle the figures. Bribing young people to sign up for courses they may not complete, might make ministers' targets look achievable ‚Äì but they do absolutely nothing to help solve this country's chronic skills shortage.\\"  Scrapping in England  The United Kingdom Government confirmed on 20 October 2010 that the Education Maintenance Allowance scheme in England was to be cancelled as part of a programme of budget cuts.\\"Education spending plans revealed \\", Teachers TV It has been replaced by a ¬£180m bursary scheme focused on students from a less wealthy household than others.BBC News The Bursary is paid to the educational establishment, unlike EMA which is paid to the student.

Alumni association Proposals for the creation of an alumni association for East began in fall of 2007. These efforts took off in 2009 with the drafting of organizational bylaws, the creation of a Board of Directors, and the launching of their website. Hostage crisis On April 24, 2006, eighteen-year-old student W. B. Foster held teacher Lisa Kukla and a student hostage with a shotgun, a hunting knife, and a pistol in the schools \\"Lower Quad C\\" hall in what is now Ms. Burek's room. After more than an hour, Lisa Kukla was able to talk Foster out of harming her or the student. Instead, Foster fired a shot through the window and fled, but was later turned in to the police. It's unknown why Foster held those two hostage, since he was never taught by Kukla, and didn't seem to know the student. In June 2007, Foster was sentenced to five years of probation, because his attorneys said he had schizophrenia.High School Kidnapper Draws 5 Years' Probation. WRAL.com. Retrieved on October 18, 2011.

Yarborough designed the U.S. Army's parachutist badge, paratrooper or 'jump' boots, and the airborne jump uniform. He is known as the \\"Father of the Modern Green Berets.\\"Zimmerman, p. 11 He is descended from the Yorkshire House of Yarborough. Yarborough is a distant cousin to such British noble figures as the Baron Deramore and Lord Alvingham. Early life William Pelham Yarborough was born May 12, 1912 in Seattle, Washington. He is the son of Colonel Leroy W. and Addessia Yarborough.Clancy, p. 73 He attended high school at San Rafael Military Academy in California and later at Columbus, Georgia. In 1931, Yarborough enlisted in the United States Army, obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy a year later in 1932.Coffman, p.311 At his graduation from West Point in June 1936 Yarborough was sworn in as a second lieutenant by General of the Armies John Joseph Pershing.Clancy, p. 74 He was assigned to the 57th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley, Luzon where he remained until February 1940, when he was transferred to the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, Georgia. He volunteered for the airborne forces and joined the newly formed 501st Parachute Battalion in late 1940 and was given command of Company \\"C\\".Coffman, p.403 Later, as Test Officer for the Provisional Parachute Group in 1941, he designed the paratrooper's boot, the paratrooper's uniform, the parachutist's qualification badge,Devlin, pp. 92‚Äì93 and a number of aerial delivery containers for which he received U. S. patents. \\"Jump wings\\" designed by Yarborough. Yarborough first met his future wife, Norma Tuttle Yarborough (1918‚Äì1999), when she was 12 and he was 18. At the time, they were neighbors when their fathers were stationed at Fort Benning. They became reacquainted when the two families were next door neighbors at Plattsburgh Barracks in New York.

Clark to be his Airborne Advisor and in that capacity accompanied him to England. As a working member of the London Planning Group, he developed the initial concept and plan for the airborne phase of the Allied invasion of North Africa, codenamed Operation Torch.Devlin, pp. 138‚Äì144 When the Paratroop Task Force departed Land's End, England on November 7, 1942, Yarborough, as executive officer (XO), accompanied it on its flight over Spain toward its target objectives in Algeria. This was the longest operational flight ever made by parachute troops. In the course of the ensuing action the airplane in which he was flying was shot down by Vichy French fighter aircraft over the Sebkra d'Oran.Devlin, pp. 152‚Äì160 He participated in combat operations to capture Tafaroui Airdrome in Algeria. A week later, Yarborough parachuted into Youks les Bains AirfieldDevlin, p. 172 near Tebessa, Algeria (near the Tunisian border) and fighting as part of a combined French and U.S. Paratroop Task Force in Tunisia until January 1943, when he returned to the United States. In March 1943, Yarborough returned to North Africa as Commanding Officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Reuben H. Tucker, itself part of the 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway. Yarborough, promoted to lieutenant colonel in May, led his battalion throughout the Allied invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky.Devlin, p. 327 Following a disastrous ambush by Italian forces at Tumminello Pass, Yarborough was relieved of his command by Major General Ridgway.Nordyke, p. 98 Mark Clark, now a lieutenant general commanding the American Fifth Army, then had him assigned to his staff. During the Allied invasion of Italy in September Yarborough served as the airborne G-3 staff officer of the Fifth Army, and organized the night drop zone to receive the latest elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, which had flown from Sicily to relieve the beleaguered beachhead at Salerno. Just prior to the fall of the Italian city and port of Naples, Yarborough was given command of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, whose CO, Major Doyle Yardley, had been captured.Devlin, p. 337 His unit, as part of Colonel William O. Darby's Ranger Force, made the initial landings at Anzio-Neptune in January 1944 and held a key position on the beachhead for the next two months. Later, after being relieved at Anzio, under his command the 509th, and two attached parachute battalions, spearheaded the Allied landings in southern France, landing on a mountaintop near Le Muy before dawn. Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo along the C√¥te d'Azur fell to the parachutists who then turned northward into the Maritime Alps to protect the right flank of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch's U.S. Seventh Army as it moved north. Yarborough returned briefly to the United States to attend the 21st course of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.Orfalea, p. 330 He returned to Italy in January 1945 as CO of the 473rd Regimental Combat Team, who had previously been antiaircraft gunners. The 473rd serving in the Italian Campaign, which, during Operation Grapeshot, fought its way up the Ligurian Coast to Genoa and the French border as World War II came to an end. It was during this campaign that he was awarded the Silver Star.Clancy, p. 77 Service in Europe, US, and Cambodia In June 1945 the 473d Infantry Regiment was deactivated and Yarborough, remaining in Europe, was named as Provost Marshal; first of the 15th Army Group, and later of the U.S. Forces in Austria and the Vienna Area Command. In the latter position he organized the famous Four Power International Patrol of Russian, French, British, and American military police. From 1947 to 1949 Yarborough served as Director of the Department of Troop Information and Education at the Armed Forces Information School, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. In 1950 he returned to Europe for the third time to attend the British Staff College at Camberley, England. Upon graduation he was assigned to the NATO Plans Section of the Joint American Military Advisory Group to Europe, stationed in London. He entered the Army War College as a student in 1952 and after graduation served on its faculty for three years. In 1956 he became Deputy Chief of the U. S. Military Advisory and Assistance Group to Cambodia. He remained in this assignment until he returned to the U.S. Army War College for a temporary tour prior to assuming command of the 1st Battle Group, 7th Infantry at Fort Benning, Georgia, later moving it to Aschaffenburg, Germany. Leaving the Battle Group in 1958, he commanded the 66th Counterintelligence Corps Group in Stuttgart for two years until his reassignment to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Commander of US Army Special Warfare Center Then Brigadier General Yarborough meeting with President John F. Kennedy at Ft Bragg, October 12, 1961. Bust of Brigadier General Yarborough In January 1961, he was appointed commander/commandant of the US Army Special Warfare Center/School for Special Warfare at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Remaining until 1965, he was instrumental in the build-up of Special Forces, overseeing the activation of four new Groups. He also worked diligently to increase the professional and academic standard of the JFK School, bringing in national figures in anthropology, history, science, and inviting leading political figures to speak. He initiated an exhaustive review of training programs and doctrine, and wrote numerous monographs on subjects pertaining to Special Operations, which are still relevant today. It was also under his management that foreign students were fully integrated into training and language instruction was expanded. He established five new courses including the Military Assistance Training Advisor School, the Unconventional Warfare course and the Counter-Terrorism course. He also initiated a staff study that later resulted in the movement of the US Army Civil Affairs School from Fort Gordon, Georgia to Fort Bragg. It was during his tenure as Commander of the Special Warfare Center that in 1961, he arranged for President Kennedy to visit Fort Bragg, the results were twofold - acquiring the funding to further develop the Special Forces into a strategic unit within the US Army and the more visible sign - the authorization of the Green Beret for wear as the official headgear of Special Forces.Clancy, pp. 67‚Äì73Pushies, p. 63 Yarborough's design for the original parachutists uniform was incorporated into the 1963 Army tropical uniform that was later worn by all Army units in the Vietnam War. =Colombia= A Fort Bragg top-level U.S. Special Warfare team, headed by Special Warfare Center commander Yarborough, visited Colombia in February 1962. In a secret supplement to his report to the joint Chiefs of Staff, Yarborough encouraged a stay-behind irregular force and its immediate deployment to eliminate communists representing a future threat: > [A] concerted country team effort should be made now to select civilian and > military personnel for clandestine training in resistance operations in case > they are needed later. This should be done with a view toward development of > a civil and military structure for exploitation in the event the Colombian > internal security system deteriorates further. This structure should be used > to pressure toward reforms known to be needed, perform counter-agent and > counter-propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage > and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents.

Yarborough encouraged \\"an intensive civilian registration program ... so that [everyone] is eventually registered in government files together with fingerprints and photographs.\\" Interrogation procedures and techniques, including regular questioning of rural villagers \\"who are believed to be knowledgeable of guerrilla activities\\" were advised. \\"Exhaustive interrogation of the bandits, to include sodium pentathol and polygraph, should be used to elicit every shred of information.

In this position, he completed exhaustive studies on the state of insurgencies in Thailand and Latin America. A year later, he became the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence on the Army General Staff where he monitored the Army's intelligence training programs, provided finished intelligence materials to the Army General Staff and directed the Army's personnel security program. He also directed the programs in which foreign military attaches assigned to Washington were involved and was responsible for their accreditation by DA. During the final years of his career, Yarborough was the Army's top intelligence officer at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. He assumed the command of I Corps in Korea in 1968, a position he held for a year. I Corps consisted of both conventional and nuclear weapons, two American divisions and three Korean Divisions and a Korean Marine Corps Brigade, numbering approximately 100,000 men. In 1969, he was assigned as the Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander in Chief, U.S. Army Pacific, responsible for directing a wide variety of Army activities in the Pacific Rim, including planning joint training exercises, response to natural disasters and monitoring intelligence operations. He retired from the Army in 1971. In 1971, the Army tasked him to prepare a classified Asian study on the state of the Asian continent after the Vietnam War. He also was a guest speaker for the National Strategy Information Center where he gave talks such as the Changing Balance of Military Power or the history of Special Forces to various groups around the country. He also was asked to visit various countries such as Rhodesia and Mozambique for the State Department. From his visits, he wrote various talking papers still in use today. Later life Yarborough was a member of the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs. He was also an honorary member of the British SAS Regiment and a member of the St. John's Lodge 260, F&AM.; He wrote two books: Bail Out Over North Africa and So You Want A Volunteer Army. General Yarborough was married to his wife Norma for over 60 years. They had three children: 2 girls and one boy, LTC (Ret.) William Lee Yarborough, US Army. Mrs. Yarborough died in 1999. Shortly before his death, Yarborough was honored on September 30, 2005 with the donation of a bust in his honor at the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, North Carolina.http://www.blackfive.net/main/2005/12/godspeed_genera.html In 2012, he and President John F. Kennedy were memorialized by a new statue at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg.

From 1997 to 2019, it hosted the Mobile BayBears, a minor-league professional team in the Southern League. The stadium opened in 1997 and has a capacity of 6,000. The ballpark was named after Major League Baseball's home run king (1974‚Äì2007) and Mobile native Hank Aaron. It also features a commemorative plaque outside the stadium to honor each Mobilian enshrined at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Hank Aaron Stadium is unique in that the luxury suites are at field level. Thus, infield seating for the general public is elevated from the field by approximately 20 feet. The BayBears played their final game on September 2, 2019, before a relocation to Madison, Alabama, in 2020. Mobile Sports and Entertainment Group (MSEG) was tabbed as operator of the stadium on December 11, 2019. History In November 1995, Mobile's city council voted to allocate $4 million to a new ballpark in Mobile and name it Hank Aaron Stadium. The city committed to pay for half the cost of construction and match the contribution of new franchise owner Eric Margenau. Architectural plans for the ballpark were unveiled in May 1996. Mobile city council member Vivian Davis Figures had suggested that the new ballpark be named after Aaron. The ballpark opened on April 17, 1997. Aaron's number 44 was retired by the BayBears and he threw out the first pitch with his parents, siblings, and extended family in attendance. On July 14, 1999, the ballpark hosted the Double-A All-Star Game in which a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of American League-affiliated All-Stars, 3‚Äì0, before 6,174 people in attendance. In the stadium's final BayBears game, Mobile was defeated by the Tennessee Smokies, 5‚Äì4, before a crowd of 1,554 people.

Many of the tracks on the album appear only as fragments, often with no breaks between them. Most of the songs are live versions of tunes from Sonic Youth's first three releases, Sonic Youth, Confusion Is Sex and the Kill Yr Idols EP. Because Sonic Youth used many different alternative tunings, but could not afford to travel with separate instruments for each tuning in the band's early years, members of the band can be heard changing tunings between songs.  Release  The album was originally released as a cassette tape on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label. It was later re-released on cassette and released on CD by Blast First and SST Records.

Used occasionally in cocktail bars, the action requires skills commonly associated with jugglers. It has become a sought-after talent among venue owners and marketers to help advertise a liquor product or the opening of a bar establishment. Competitions have been sponsored by liquor brands to attract flair bartenders, and some hospitality training companies hold courses to teach flair techniques. Flair bartending is sometimes referred to as \\"extreme bartending\\" or contracted to \\"flairtending\\". The word flair became popular among practitioners in the mid-1990s. \\"Flair\\" is also used as a verb (e.g. \\"to flair\\"), referring to any trickery used by a bartender in order to entertain guests while mixing a drink. Flair can include juggling, flipping (bottles, shakers), manipulating flaming liquors or even performing close-up magic tricks (also referred to as \\"bar-magic\\"). Flair is showmanship added to bartending that enhances the overall guest experience. The ideas behind mixology and drink-oriented or service-minded bartending can still be upheld with the correct application of working flair. Recently, there is a noticeable rise in bartenders combining prominent mixology knowledge and working flair skills all over the world. Working flair and Exhibition flair are very similar on the grounds that they both require precision and practice, however the use of exhibition flair has become a competition oriented style where significantly greater risks are being taken. Working flair, which is much more common, focuses more on delivering drinks to customers while still ensuring visual entertainment. History The earliest record of a flair bartender is barman Jerry \\"The Professor\\" Thomas, who poured fiery streams of boiling water and flaming whisky and mixed an original cocktail called the Blue Blazer in the late nineteenth century. Flairing was also prominently featured in the 1988 film Cocktail starring Tom Cruise. Flair competitions Both working flair and exhibition flair can be seen in competitions, depending on the rules and regulations of each event. The important distinction between working flair and exhibition flair is not so much the level of liquid in the bottles (though that is a criterion) but the speed in which the bottle is thrown and/or the drink is made. Working flair usually incorporates a \\"flat\\" throw, which is when the bottle is released into the air without flipping. This gives an illusion of the bottle floating, but reduces the chances of liquid spilling. This also opens the bartender to be able to use similar routines, regardless of what bottle they grab, as the level of liquid is not a factor. The accepted definition of working flair is \\"flair that does not noticeably slow service\\", usually involving bottles filled to various levels (as in a real work situation) that are quickly manipulated and then poured. Exhibition flair almost always involves bottles that are often pre-set with less than 2 ounces (60ml) specifically for flipping. Exhibition flair often involves longer sequences and routines, multiple objects, and performances choreographed to music. The first open competition to have an exhibition round was the Quest for the Best Bartender in 1995. The first open competition to have a working flair round was the Quest for the Best Bartender in the World in 1999. The first all working flair bartending competition was the Flair Bartenders Shakedown in 2006 organized by BarWars LLC. There are different styles of flair bartending competitions. Legends of Bartending World Bartender Championships test the bartender on four disciplines of bartending, accuracy, speed, working flair and exhibition flair. The Blue Blazer and Independent Flair League (IFL) in Poland rewards flair and mixology together; competitors gain points for both flair and creative mixology. NATIONS International Flair Challenge and other competitions like Roadhouse World Flair, MBA, Athens Flair Open feature pure exhibition flair where the biggest and best moves are shown. Competition history In 1986, T.G.I. Friday's management encouraged their bartenders to show their personalities behind the bar and this resulted in several bartenders (a few being John JB Bandy, John Mescall, and Magic Mike) being sent to the corporate T.G.I. Friday's office in Texas to shoot a bartending video. At the end of 1986, T.G.I. Friday's hosted the first national flair bartending competition called \\"Bar Olympics\\" in Woodland Hills, California. John JB Bandy was the winner of this competition. In 1987, after interviewing 34 bartenders, John JB Bandy was approached across the bar by Touchstone Pictures to assist in training Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown for the 1988 film, Cocktail. Later that year after filming, John JB Bandy produced the very first flair bartending training video called \\"Olympic Bartending\\". T.G.I. Friday's is credited for modernizing and popularizing flair bartending in the United States beginning in the mid-1980s because they allowed artistic personality freedom behind the bar. London (Roadhouse) and Orlando (Quest for the Best at Pleasure Island's Manniquins) were the hotbeds of flair bartending in the early and mid-1990s. In 1991, T.G.I. Friday's started its global competition called World Bartender Championship.Past Champions, T.G.I.

In 2005 the Flair Bartenders Association (FBA) launched the FBA Pro Tour, a linked series of events where competitors earn points toward the title Pro Tour Champion at the end of the year. In 2007 there were 14 events on the Pro Tour with 7 of them located in the US. In 2008 the World Flair Association launched the Grand Slam. A worldwide tournament the includes the best competitions from all over the world. It is seen today as the biggest competition/tournament to win in the world of flair. Bartenders travel far and wide for the Grand Slam events to try and earn the title of Grand Slam World Champion. The Grand Slam events vary each year, being located in Europe, Asia, and America. Five-Time World Champion Ken Hall and Jim Allison, president of the FBA, organized six of those seven events. The flagship flair bartending event is Legends of Bartending, which celebrated its twelfth year in 2010.

Early life  Born in Amherst, Nebraska, on September 10, 1907, son of Gertrude De La Barre and John Albert Fitch. Fitch was the first Eagle Scout in Nebraska, and one of the very earliest west of the Mississippi River. He graduated from Kearney High School and received an appointment to West Point, having been nominated by Nebraska senator Robert B. Howell. Junior officer Fitch graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in June 1930 and became a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery. He was promoted to first lieutenant in September 1935 and served as aide-de-camp to Gen. Lesley J. McNair from 1937 to 1939.  World War II  Fitch received the Distinguished Service Cross for using his 23rd Field Artillery troops to clear a coastal escape route for 1st Division forces cut off by a Japanese roadblock. Fitch was sent to Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines in February 1940 and He commanded Battery A of the 23rd Field Artillery Regiment, which was armed with horse and mule drawn QF 2.95-inch Mountain Guns. He was promoted to captain in June 1940. After the invasion of the Philippines began on 8 December 1941, the 23rd Field Artillery was attached to the 26th Cavalry Regiment on December 13 and retreated with other units of I Corps to Bataan. Fitch was promoted to major in January 1942 and was put in command of the 71st Field Artillery when Colonel Halstead C. Fowler was wounded. Fitch received the Distinguished Service Cross for leading a battalion of artillery cut off by Japanese encirclement to remaining I Corp units south of Mauban. He was captured in May 1942 a few days after surrender and taken prisoner. A survivor of the Bataan Death March, he was held at Luzon at Camp O'Donnell In December 1944 he was transferred with other Bataan survivors aboard the ≈åryoku Maru to the Fukuoka prison camps. He was released in September 1945. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star for heroism and courage in combat and while a captive of the Japanese. Post-war Brigadier General Alva R. Fitch, Division Artillery Commander of the 3rd Armored Division. From February to July 1946 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and remained as an instructor until August 1947. In the Korean War, Fitch was an artillery commander and then commanded the 3rd Armored Division. He later served as Chief of Staff of Army Intelligence before being named to the Defense Intelligence Agency post in 1964. Military intelligence Fitch being sworn in as Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence by Maj. Gen. Joe C. Lambert at The Pentagon in 1961 He served on the Army Aircraft Requirements Review Board, also known as the Rogers Board, which was established on January 15, 1960, by the Army Chief of Staff to review the Army Aircraft Development Plan and the related industry proposals. The Rogers Board's members included Major Generals Hamilton H. Howze, Thomas F. Van Natta, Robert J. Wood, Richard D. Meyer, Ernest F. Easterbrook, and chairman Lieutenant General Gordon B.

Illustration of the power of point P in the circle centered on the point O. The distance s is shown in orange, the radius r is shown in blue, and the tangent line segment PT is shown in red. In elementary plane geometry, the power of a point is a real number h that reflects the relative distance of a given point from a given circle. Specifically, the power of a point P with respect to a circle O of radius r is defined by (Figure 1). :h = s^2 - r^2 where s is the distance between P and the center O of the circle. By this definition, points inside the circle have negative power, points outside have positive power, and points on the circle have zero power. For external points, the power equals the square of the length of a tangent from the point to the circle. The power of a point is also known as the point's circle power or the power of a circle with respect to the point. The power of point P (see in Figure 1) can be defined equivalently as the product of distances from the point P to the two intersection points of any line through P. For example, in Figure 1, a ray emanating from P intersects the circle in two points, M and N, whereas a tangent ray intersects the circle in one point T; the horizontal ray from P intersects the circle at A and B, the endpoints of the diameter. Their respective products of distances are equal to each other and to the power of point P in that circle : \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{PT}}^2 = \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{PM}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{PN}} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{PA}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{PB}} = (s - r) \\\\times (s + r) = s^2 - r^2 = h. This equality is sometimes known as the \\"secant-tangent theorem\\", \\"intersecting chords theorem\\", or the \\"power-of-a-point theorem\\". In the case that P lies inside the circle, the two points of intersection will be on different sides of the line through P; the line can be considered to have a direction, so that one of the distances is negative, and therefore so is the product of the two. The power of a point is used in many geometrical definitions and proofs. For example, the radical axis of two given circles is the straight line consisting of points that have equal power to both circles. For each point on this line, there is a unique circle centered on that point that intersects both given circles orthogonally; equivalently, tangents of equal length can be drawn from that point to both given circles. Similarly, the radical center of three circles is the unique point with equal power to all three circles. There exists a unique circle, centered on the radical center, that intersects all three given circles orthogonally, equivalently, tangents drawn from the radical center to all three circles have equal length. The power diagram of a set of circles divides the plane into regions within which the circle minimizing the power is constant. More generally, French mathematician Edmond Laguerre defined the power of a point with respect to any algebraic curve in a similar way. Orthogonal circle Figure 2: The dashed circle is centered on the point P and intersects the given circle (solid black) at right angles, i.e., orthogonally, at point T. The squared radius of the orthogonal circle equals the power of P with respect to the given circle. For a point P outside the circle, the power h =R2, the square of the radius R of a new circle centered on P that intersects the given circle at right angles, i.e., orthogonally (Figure 2). If the two circles meet at right angles at a point T, then radii drawn to T from P and from O, the center of the given circle, likewise meet at right angles (blue line segments in Figure 2). Therefore, the radius line segment of each circle is tangent to the other circle. These line segments form a right triangle with the line segment connecting O and P. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, : R^2 = s^2 - r^2 = h \\\\, where s is again the distance from the point P to the center O of the given circle (solid black in Figure 2). This construction of an orthogonal circle is useful in understanding the radical axis of two circles, and the radical center of three circles. The point T can be constructed‚Äîand, thereby, the radius R and the power h found geometrically‚Äîby finding the intersection of the given circle with a semicircle (red in Figure 2) centered on the midpoint of O and P and passing through both points. It can also be shown that the point Q is the inverse of P with respect to the given circle. Theorems The power of a point theorem, due to Jakob Steiner, states that for any line through A intersecting a circle c in points P and Q, the power of the point with respect to the circle c is given up to a sign by the product :AP \\\\cdot AQ \\\\, of the lengths of the segments from A to P and A to Q, with a positive sign if A is outside the circle and a negative sign otherwise: if A is on the circle, the product is zero. In the limiting case, when the line is tangent to the circle, P = Q, and the result is immediate from the Pythagorean theorem. In the other two cases, when A is inside the circle, or A is outside the circle, the power of a point theorem has two corollaries. * The chord theorem, theorem of intersecting chords, or chord-chord power theorem states that if A is a point inside a circle and PQ and RS are chords of the circle intersecting at A, then :: AP \\\\cdot AQ = AR \\\\cdot AS \\\\, :The common value of these products is the negative of the power of the point A with respect to the circle. * The intersecting secants theorem (or secant-secant power theorem) states that if PQ and RS are chords of a circle which intersect at a point A outside the circle, then ::AP \\\\cdot AQ = AR \\\\cdot AS \\\\, :In this case the common value is the same as the power of A with respect to the circle. * The tangent-secant theorem is a special case of the theorem of intersecting secants, where points Q and P coincide, i.e. ::AP \\\\cdot AQ = AR \\\\cdot AS \\\\, ::AP \\\\cdot AP = AR \\\\cdot AS \\\\, ::AP^2 = AR \\\\cdot AS \\\\, :This has utility in such applications as determining the distance to a point P on the horizon, by selecting points R and S to form a diameter chord, so that RS is the diameter of the planet, AR is the height above the planet, and AP is the distance to the horizon. Darboux product The power of a point is a special case of the Darboux product between two circles, which is given by :\\\\left A_1A_2 \\\\right^2-r_1^2-r_2^2 \\\\, where A1 and A2 are the centers of the two circles and r1 and r2 are their radii. The power of a point arises in the special case that one of the radii is zero. If the two circles are orthogonal, the Darboux product vanishes. If the two circles intersect, then their Darboux product is :2r_1 r_2 \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\, where œÜ is the angle of intersection. Laguerre's theorem Laguerre defined the power of a point P with respect to an algebraic curve of degree n to be the product of the distances from the point to the intersections of a circle through the point with the curve, divided by the nth power of the diameter d. Laguerre showed that this number is independent of the diameter . In the case when the algebraic curve is a circle this is not quite the same as the power of a point with respect to a circle defined in the rest of this article, but differs from it by a factor of d2.

Life Tersteegen was born in Moers, at that time the principal city of a county belonging to the House of Orange-Nassau that formed a Protestant enclave in the midst of a Catholic country. After being educated at the gymnasium of his native town, Tersteegen was for some years apprenticed to a merchant. He soon came under the influence of Wilhelm Hoffman, a Pietistic revivalist, and devoted himself to writing and public speaking, withdrawing in 1728 from all secular pursuits and giving himself entirely to religious work. He also had a great influence on radical Pietism. His writings include a collection of hymns, such as Das geistliche Blumeng√§rtlein [The spiritual flower-garden) of 1729 (new edition, Stuttgart, 1868), a volume of Gebete (prayers), and another of Briefe (letters), besides translations of the writings of the French mystics and of Julian of Norwich. He died in M√ºlheim, North Rhine-Westphalia. Sermons Tersteegen was well known for his deeply spiritual sermons. People crowded into his home to hear him speak of the things of God. Some of his sermons have been translated into English, including Godliness, and Warnings and Admonitions. Additional sermons can be found in Samuel Jackson's Spiritual Crumbs from the Master's Table and H. E. Govan's Gerhard Tersteegen: Life and Selections. Poetry Tersteegen's poetry is beautiful and spiritual. An example from his hymns: Hymns Hymns by Tersteegen were printed in several hymnals internationally, for example in the Danish Roskilde Konvents Psalmebog 1855, and later in Psalmebog 1912, with one hymn, \\"Kom, lad tr√∏stig vandre\\" (No. 564). In Sweden, a popular songbook with spiritual songs and prayers by Thomas √† Kempis named Lilla Kempis. Korta Spr√•k och B√∂ner, till uppbyggelse f√∂r de enfaldiga (4th edition 1876) contained 19 hymns by Tersteegen. In The Church Hymn book 1872 he is represented with four hymns: \\"God calling yet\\" (\\"Gott rufet noch\\", 1730, No. 655), \\"Thou hidden love of God\\" (\\"Verborgne Gottesliebe, Du\\", 1731 No. 744), \\"Something every heart is loving\\" (1730, No. 782) and \\"O thou, to whose all-searching sight\\" (1731, No. 927). In The English Hymnal with Tunes, 1933, he is represented with the procession hymn \\"Gott ist gegenw√§rtig\\", in the English translation by John Wesley as \\"Lo! God is here!\\" (No. 637). Wesley translated several of Tersteegen's texts. Correspondence Tersteegen corresponded with many people. He was always practical and sought to help people learn how to live in God's presence. Among the more fundamental principles he espoused were the following: :\\"The Christian ought to form an invincible resolution to become as perfect as possible, and take the life and doctrine of the Saviour as his pattern.\\" :\\"The means for this purpose are, walking before God - that is, a constant introversion and inwardness, so that the attention is continually directed to that which passes in the soul, and every inclination not acceptable to God is stifled at birth.\\" :\\"With this exercise, unceasing or inward prayer must be connected, which consists in a continued inclination to, and an habitual dependence upon, God, even in the smallest matters.\\" :\\"All this must be practiced in a state of constant tranquility and inward humiliation before God.\\" :\\"In order to render it easy, the individual must seek solitude and retirement as much as is consistent with his outward calling.\\" Reflections Here are samples of his reflections: :Regarding God's presence: :\\"The secret of God‚Äôs presence is actually believed by very few, but are you aware, that if each one truly believed it, the whole world would at once be filled with the saints, and the earth would be truly Paradise? If men really believed it as they should, they would need nothing more to induce them to give themselves up, heart and soul, to this loving God. But now it is hid from their eyes. Let us pray, my beloved, that God may be made known and manifested to many hearts, and thus in the light of His divine presence, the darkness of mere human life may be dispelled, and all things cast away, both without and within the heart, which hinder the growth and life of the soul, and which this light alone discovers and unveils. In all Christian practice there is nothing more universally needful, nothing simpler, sweeter, and more useful, nothing which so sums up in itself all Christian duties in one blessed act, as the realization of the loving presence of God.‚Äù :On spiritual advancement: :\\"I record with deep sorrow the fact that, in our days, in the case of newly converted souls, the necessity of advance and pressing forward in holiness of life is not sufficiently insisted upon, whereas the Scripture is so clear and full upon this subject. In the Scripture we find that holiness includes a real and actual cleansing from sin and pollution, in the renewing of the inner man, in a changing from glory to glory after the image of Him who created us, in conformity to Jesus Christ. Let us seek after all these things, praying earnestly, and withdrawing ourselves into the seclusion of the inner sanctuary of communion with God, Who is so inexpressibly near to us, Who desires, by the power of the resurrection of Christ, by the Spirit of holiness, to sanctify us wholly, to work by us, to live, and move in us.\\" :On the work of the Spirit: :\\"When the Spirit enters into the heart, He fills it entirely, so that the world finds no more room or place in it, because this Guest makes Himself sole Lord and Master of it. The first disciples and believers were so entirely taken possession of by this blissful dominion of the Pentecostal Spirit that they were no longer masters of their own tongues or any other member. They were compelled, as it were, to speak, even as the Spirit gave them utterance. They could not long speak according to their own judgment, knowledge, and learning. No! They were constrained to do and speak as the Holy Spirit would have them. Thus it is with every one with whom the Holy Spirit takes up His residence. He then experiences the blissful dominion of our Lord Jesus Christ in his heart. The Holy Spirit is then the scepter which is sent forth out of Zion into our hearts. He takes possession of all our will and desire, all our actions and deportment, all our inclinations and affections and makes us entirely subject to Him. He dwells in our hearts like a king in the realm of his palace. He ordains and accomplishes in us that which is pleasing and acceptable to Him. He creates in us another principle and beginning of life. He becomes to the soul, as it were, the life of her life. He renews her daily more and more in the image of Him that created her, and forms her into a temple of truth and righteousness‚Äîyea, to a living temple of God in Jesus Christ. All the glory of earthly kings and princes are only vain shadows and child‚Äôs-play compared with the single Pentecostal heart which is deemed worthy of receiving the Spirit of Jesus Christ in such plenitude.\\" Tersteegen was ever hopeful of God's favor, as attested in the following: :\\"This inestimable favour and honour is not only earnestly desired for you by me, but is kindly intended for and graciously offered by Jesus Himself to the most wretched amongst you. Could we, who are deserving of the curse, behold even only through a fissure the opened heart of Jesus, what should we not see! What should we not feel! :As long as we lived in a state of carnal security, without God and without Jesus, we stood on the brink of perdition's yawning gulf, and were unconscious of it. Jesus loved us, sought us, and we knew it not. It is He that hath taken us by the hand, that hath drawn us away from that dreadful abyss, that hath directed our minds to Himself, and, instead of the well-deserved pit of hell, hath opened unto us the unfathomable abyss of His loving heart, in order that we may fly to this safe and blessed city of refuge from all sin and danger, and become eternally happy in Him. Oh, come, my dear brethren! Taste and see how gracious the Lord is, and how unspeakably blessed we may be in communion with Him, even during the present state of existence! Seek nowhere else alleviation for your burdened hearts. All besides is deception. You will not find it out of Christ, but only be adding to your burden by seeking it elsewhere. :He that abhors all his sins, has a right to believe that he has the forgiveness of all his sins and cleansing from them in the blood of Christ; but he that wishes to receive Christ, and yet secretly retain both the world and sin, his faith is vain. He that gives all for all, shall certainly obtain the pearl of great price; but how can a person receive anything whose hands are already full! Do not console yourselves on unsubstantial grounds, till Jesus consoles you in His due time, lest you be injured by it.\\" (H. E. Govan, Gerhard Tersteegen Life and Selections, (London: James Nisbet, 1898), pp. 86, 87.) He also recognized that blessings come packaged as trials: :\\"Be willing to occupy the lowest place, till the Lord Himself says, 'Friend, come up hither' (Luke xiv.). Only wait at Jesus' feet, ye troubled hearts‚Äîno one waits in vain; for whilst we wait, the precious corn groweth up. We are not so happy in the world, when all things go well with us, as we are with Jesus in troublous times. Every tear and every sigh will bring, in due time, abundant fruit. Learn to keep Lent with Jesus. Be not disquieted, dejected, or faint-hearted, when sufferings, trials, and temptations arise. We ought rather to fortify our hearts with confidence when these things befall us, even as they happened to our great Forerunner.\\" (Ibid., pp. 87,88) Tersteegen was adamant that all spiritual growth and joy was centered in a relationship with Jesus Christ. He also realized that understanding and coming into a relationship with Christ was progressive in nature, as delineated in the following: :\\"The assurance of the forgiveness of sins is commonly taken for believing in Jesus; but in my opinion this is incorrect. That which I have more fitly called the drawing of the Father, I might also with propriety call believing in Jesus; for the Father draws us to the Son. But faith in Christ has its gradations. In the beginning it is a coming to Jesus (John 6:35); that is, with hunger and desire. It is afterwards a receiving of Jesus (John 1:12), which cannot take place unless the sincere will of the soul lets go at once the world, sin, and self. In advancing, faith is an abiding in Jesus (John 15), namely, with a fervent inclination, otherwise called retiring within or cleaving to Him (1 Cor. 6:17); and thus, by abiding and walking in Jesus, we are increasingly rooted and grounded in Him (Col 2:7), which, however, is not accomplished without affliction and trials. Faith is, finally, a dwelling of Christ in the soul, and of the soul in Christ (Eph. 3:17); John 17:23), and a becoming one with Him. By referring to and considering the passages quoted, you may perhaps attain more light on the subject.\\" (Ibid., pp. 84, 85) References ;Attribution * External links * * Tersteegen page at path2prayer.com Publications * Gerhard Tersteegen, Briefe.

He distinguished himself by heading the first modern American military combat intelligence function during World War I. Nolan served as the head football coach at the United States Military Academy in 1902, compiling a record of 6‚Äì1‚Äì1. Early life and education  Born in Akron, New York, outside of Buffalo, New York, Nolan was the son of an Irish immigrant. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1896. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Nolan was commissioned a second lieutenant and joined the Third Infantry. He served with the Sanitary Corps, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Football coaching career In 1902, Nolan coached the Army football team to a record of 6 wins, 1 loss and 1 draw. The New York Times of 1930s noted that many contemporary generals (Nolan, Leon Kromer, Malin Craig, Paul Bunker) were connected by past football experience at West Point.Many of Army's Football Stars Now Hold High Rank in Service. The New York Times, October 16, 1935.Many West Point Athletes Who Became Generals. The New York Times, August 2, 1931. Later military career During World War I, Nolan organized the Intelligence Section for the American Expeditionary Forces' general headquarters. Starting in August 1920, Nolan, then a brigadier general, served for a year as the War Department Chief of Military Intelligence Division. From 1927 to 1931, Nolan was commander of Fifth Corps Area, headquartered at Fort Hayes at Columbus, Ohio, one of and geographically the largest of nine corps areas established in the continental United States for the administration of the regular army and reserves by the National Defense Act of 1920. As a corps area commander, he oversaw peacetime training for Army Reserves and the National Guard. In time of war, the corps areas would theoretically have ready made corps combat command structures in place to administer regiments of Regular Army, Reserve and National Guard. During the lean post-war and Great Depression years of military spending, he as well other corps commanders were expected to maintain good relations with the public and civilian officials. Nolan accepted his final posting as commanding general of Second Corps Area, in charge of army units and facilities in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Puerto Rico on December 1, 1931. On October 1, 1933, First United States Army was reestablished, co-located and co-staffed with Second Corps Area at Fort Jay, Governors Island, New York. Nolan became First Army's first peace time commander. Nolan ended his active duty army career upon retirement on April 30, 1936. Awards  Nolan received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army Distinguished Service Medal, and two Silver Star Citations. He also received the Croix de Guerre with Palm and the Medal of Solidaridad from Panama. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a Commander of the Legion of Honour, and a Commander of the Order of the Crown, as well as appointments to the Order of the Crown of Italy and National Order of Merit of Chile. Personal life  Nolan married Julia Grant Sharp on August 21, 1901. She was the daughter of Alexander Sharp and Ellen \\"Nellie\\" Dent. Nellie Dent Sharp was the sister of Ulysses S. Grant's wife Julia Boggs Dent. In addition to her aunt Julia, Julia Sharp's family included uncle Frederick Tracy Dent. Dennis and Julia Nolan were the parents of two children: Dennis and Ellen Honora. Nolan died on February 24, 1956 in New York City, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The ballpark, which was opened in 1991 and extensively renovated in 1999, has a capacity of 6,500. The stadium's name comes from its location - the stadium property is located in Wake County, but it is close to the intersection of the county lines between Wake, Franklin, Nash and Johnston Counties. Wilson County is also in the general area of the stadium. US-264 passes by the stadium at a generally northwest-to-southeast angle (behind left and center fields), while State Highway 39 skirts the east side of the property (right field). Parking lots surround the field on the other sides, and a large grass field, often used as a campground, lies behind home plate. History When Columbus Mudcats owner Steve Bryant moved the club to North Carolina in 1991, he wanted a new facility that was deemed to be outside the territories of other minor league clubs in the state (including the Carolina League's Greensboro Hornets, which he also owned) while also being easily accessible by the public. A site was chosen in Zebulon, which was as close to Raleigh as the Mudcats could get without infringing on the territorial rights of the Durham Bulls. To construct the ballpark quickly, the builders opted for metal seating rather than the traditional concrete. The 1999 renovation replaced most of the metal with concrete. The Double-A Mudcats moved to Pensacola in 2011, and the Carolina League's Kinston Indians moved to Zebulon and took the Mudcats name.

Boon, Mike Watt was suffering from depression. After dropping girlfriend Kira Roessler at an internship at Yale, Watt went to New York City and stayed with Gordon and Moore, spending time with the band during the EVOL sessions. Watt played bass on two songs recorded at the time, \\"In the Kingdom #19\\" and the band's cover of \\"Bubblegum\\". In an effort to encourage Watt to begin playing music again, the Ciccone Youth project was conceived. In 1986, a 7-inch single was released in the U.S. on New Alliance Records under the name of Ciccone Youth with Mike Watt performing Madonna's \\"Burnin' Up\\" on Side A. The song was recorded without Sonic Youth's participation in California with Mike Watt playing all of the instruments except for the lead guitar part which was played by Greg Ginn. Side AA consisted of two Sonic Youth songs recorded during the EVOL sessions, \\"Tough Titty Rap\\" and a cover of Madonna's \\"Into the Groove\\" which was titled \\"Into the Groove(y)\\". All three songs were credited as Ciccone Youth. Blast First would release the record the same year in Europe as a 12-inch single with the two Sonic Youth songs on Side A and Mike Watt's \\"Burnin' Up\\" as the b-side. \\"Into the Groove(y)\\" sold 8000 copies in the U.K. due to play in dance clubs. Beside the single and the Whitey Album, Sonic Youth would also use the Ciccone name in the lyrics of the title song on the 1987 EP Master-Dik. Moore announces throughout the song, \\"We're Ciccone.\\" The track and the EP however were attributed to Sonic Youth. Background and composition Seeking a break from their own style of music at the conclusion of the Sister tour, Sonic Youth returned to Wharton Tiers' studio and began recording songs for the Whitey album. With the aid of a sampling device, the band created the songs in the studio. Contrary to many Sonic Youth albums, drum machines and samplers are the foundation of the recording, but Sonic Youth's trademark dissonance and experimental methods still permeate throughout. Although it is suggested through only a few songs, the album is somewhat a tongue-in-cheek tribute to Madonna and 1980s pop in general. Ahead of Madonna's 60th birthday in 2018, frontman Thurston Moore told The Guardian: > Madonna was actually in a couple of no-wave bands that nobody ever talks > about. She was in a band with these two twins, Dan and Josh Braun, who were > the first members of Swans, Michael Gira's band. Nobody really knows about > that part of her history; she was in a pre-Swans no wave band! There's all > that interconnected history in New York with Madonna and the no wave scene. > [...] Eventually she started making really amazing dance records. \\"Into the > Groove\\" was brilliant to the point where I thought it would be a great song > to cover through the prism of Sonic Youth. Instantly fabulous. We took her > record and put it on one of the channels in the studio and we would fade it > into [our version of] the song once in a while, not thinking about the > legalities of such a move. We made a single with Mike Watt from Minutemen on > a label called New Alliance, a sub-label of Black Flag's SST Records [\\"Into > the Groove(y)\\"]. We wanted to break down any kind of barrier that was being > set up between the underground and the people who had graduated from it to > the mainstream. We actually embraced Madonna's joie de vivre, her celebrity. > We did that record and everybody felt we were crazy, and some people > lambasted us for giving her some kind of credibility in the underground. But > she already had credibility, as far as I was concerned; she was already a > part of the downtown scene. I don't think she capitalised on it. \\"Tough Titty Rap\\" and \\"Into the Groove(y)\\" are the same versions as the ones on the single released two years earlier. However Mike Watt's version of \\"Burnin' Up\\" is his four-track demo of the song, recorded prior to the version that appeared on the 1986 single. Recorded in his home, Watt sings and plays all instruments and it is his only contribution to the album. The album includes a hip-hop version of \\"Making the Nature Scene\\" which originally appeared on Confusion is Sex. The second track, \\"(Silence)\\", is a titular one minute gap of silence intended as a tribute to John Cage. The cover of Robert Palmer's \\"Addicted to Love\\" was recorded by Gordon in a Karaoke booth and she made the song's video at a make-your-own-video booth at Macy's. Sonic Youth originally wanted to released the album simultaneously with Daydream Nation but were convinced to release it several months later by associates of the band. Artwork According to the liner notes of the deluxe edition of Daydream Nation: \\"The album cover [of Ciccone Youth], a b&w; xerox enlargement of Madonna's face, was a brilliant and contemporary design. Sonic Youth had employed found images on album covers before, but this was testing the limit. We sent copies of the vinyl album to Warners to be passed on to Madonna via her sister who worked in the art department there. Word came back that she had no problem with it acknowledging she remembered the band from her NYC Danceteria days\\".Daydream Nation (Deluxe Edition) - liner notes.

He was the seventh Bishop and the first Archbishop of Galveston-Houston, serving from 1985 to 2006. He previously served as Bishop of San Angelo from 1979 to 1984. Early life and education Joseph Fiorenza was born in Beaumont, Texas, the second of four sons of Anthony and Grace (n√©e Galiano) Fiorenza. His father immigrated from Sicily at age 10, while his mother was the daughter of Sicilian immigrants. He attended St. Anthony High School in Beaumont, where he was football team captain and senior class president. He skipped a grade and graduated from high school at age 16 in 1947. He then studied at St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte. Priesthood Fiorenza was ordained to the priesthood on May 29, 1954. His first assignment was as assistant pastor of Queen of Peace Church in Houston, where he remained for three years. In 1957, he became professor of medical ethics at Sacred Heart Dominican College and chaplain of St. Joseph Hospital in Houston. He served as administrator of Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral from 1959 to 1967. In 1965, he participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches during the Civil Rights Movement. Fiorenza served as pastor of St. Augustine Church (1967‚Äì69) and of St. Benedict the Abbot Church (1969‚Äì72), both in Houston. From 1972 to 1973, he was both pastor of Assumption Church and vice-chancellor of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston. He was named Honorary Prelate of His Holiness by Pope Paul VI on December 5, 1973, and served as diocesan chancellor from 1973 to 1979. Episcopacy On September 4, 1979, Fiorenza was appointed the fourth Bishop of San Angelo by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 25 from Archbishop Patrick Flores, with Bishops John Louis Morkovsky and John E. McCarthy serving as co-consecrators, at Sacred Heart Cathedral. On December 18, 1984, Fiorenza was named Bishop of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston by Pope John Paul II. He was installed as Bishop of Galveston-Houston by Archbishop Patrick Flores in the presence of Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio. The Diocese of Galveston- Houston was elevated to the status of Archdiocese by John Paul II on Dec. 29, 2004, at which point Fiorenza became an archbishop. When a wave of allegations of sexual abuse of boys and girls within the Catholic Church was widely reported from 2002, Fiorenza issued a statement proclaiming that the archdiocese would \\"make the protection and safety of children and young people a top priority\\", but it has been reported that nothing was done; internal memos from 1996‚Äîpublished in detail by the press‚Äîshow that abuse was reported but ignored for years. In a 2006 news report Fiorenza was said to have had a tendency to accept troubled clergy into his domains; and the Galveston-Houston archdiocese acted to protect the church from public scrutiny, mounting vigorous legal defenses, blaming the victims, and obfuscating for the news media. Archbishop Fiorenza submitted his letter of retirement to the Vatican in February 2006 at the customary age of 75 years. The response was received on February 28, 2006, officially granting Fiorenza his retirement and declaring former coadjutor Archbishop Daniel DiNardo the presiding Archbishop of Galveston-Houston.

A VAX port was done in 1986 by Comer and Tom Stonecypher, an IBM PC compatible port in 1988 by Comer and Timothy Fossum, a second Motorola 68000 (Sun 3) port circa 1988 by Shawn Ostermann, a Macintosh platform port in 1989 by Comer and Steven Munson, an Intel 80486 version by John Lin in 1995, a SPARC port by Jim Griffioen, and a PowerPC port in 2005 and MIPS port of Embedded Xinu in 2006 by Dennis Brylow. Later developments Dennis Brylow at Marquette University has ported Xinu to both the PowerPC and MIPSEL processor architectures. Porting Xinu to reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures greatly simplified its implementation, increasing its ability to be used as a tool for teaching and research. MIPSEL was chosen as a target architecture due to the proliferation of the MIPSEL-based WRT54GL router and the cool incentive that motivates some students to become involved in projects. The first embedded Xinu systems laboratory based on the WRT54GL router was developed at Marquette University. In collaboration with the Marquette Xinu team, an embedded Xinu laboratory was formed at the University of Mississippi, laying the groundwork for further work on developing a Virtual Xinu Laboratory. Embedded Xinu Embedded Xinu is a fresh reimplementation of the Xinu design, in ANSI C, on an embedded RISC architecture. The MIPS port of Embedded Xinu was developed from 2006 to 2010 at Marquette University, under the direction of Dr. Dennis Brylow. The Embedded Xinu operating system is copyright (c) 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 by Douglas Comer and Dennis Brylow. The first successful port of embedded Xinu was in 1994, when it was implemented in a Kenmore model 728858 microwave oven produced in the year 1990. University of Mississippi Embedded Xinu Laboratory The Xinu Laboratory in the University of Mississippi's Department of Computer and Information Science was formed during the summer of 2008 by Dr. Paul Ruth. Assisting him in the project were Jianshu Zhao and Patrick Hoover, who were both graduate students at the time. Also assisting him were Chelsea Norman and Kevin Kent, who were undergraduates at the time. The initial laboratory is based on the Marquette University Embedded Xinu Laboratory. Located in the server room of Weir Hall on the campus of the University of Mississippi, is composed of a dozen modified Linksys WRT54GL wireless routers, a 32 port Digi Etherlite serial annex, a 24 port 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet switch, a BayTech serial controlled power strip, and quite a few wires. The system is controlled by a standard PC running Debian Linux. The whole system cost less than $3000, not including the PC. The WRT54G routers use the MIPSEL architecture and are used as backend devices on which the Xinu embedded operating system runs. The PC runs several daemons which enable and manage the users ability to access the backends.  Nexos Project  The Nexos Project is a joint effort between Marquette University, the University at Buffalo, and the University of Mississippi to build curriculum materials and a supporting experimental laboratory for hands-on projects in computer systems courses. The approach focuses on low cost, flexible, commodity embedded hardware, freely available development and debugging tools, and a fresh implementation of a classic operating system, Embedded Xinu, that is ideal for student exploration. Virtual Xinu addresses two challenges that limit the effectiveness of Nexos. First, potential faculty adopters have clearly indicated that even with the current minimal monetary cost of installation, the hardware modifications, and time investment remain troublesome factors that scare off interested educators. Second, overcoming inherent complications that arise due to the shared subnet that allow student projects to interfere with each other in ways that are difficult to recreate, debug, and understand. Ultimately, porting the Xinu operating systems to QEMU virtual hardware, and developing the virtual networking platform have produced results showing success using Virtual Xinu in the classroom during one semester of the Operating Systems course at the University of Mississippi by Dr Ruth.

Nerses I the Great () was an Armenian Catholicos (or Patriarch) who lived in the fourth century. He was the son of At'anagenes and his mother was the Arsacid Princess Bambish, a sister of King Tigranes VII (Tiran)P'awstos Buzandac'i, History of Armenia, p. 81 and a daughter of King Khosrov III. His paternal grandfather was St. Husik I whose paternal grandfather was Saint Gregory the Illuminator. Nerses spent his youth in Caesarea where he married a Mamikonian princess called Sanducht. Sanducht bore Nerses a son called Sahak, who would become another Catholicos in Armenia. After the death of his wife, he was appointed sword-bearer to Arsacid king Arsaces II (Arshak II). A few years later, having entered the ecclesiastical state, he was elected Catholicos in 353. His patriarchate marks a new era in Armenian history. Until that point, the Church had been more or less identified with the royal family and the nobles; Nerses brought it into closer connection with the people. At the Council of Ashtishat he promulgated numerous laws on marriage, fast days, and divine worship. He built schools and hospitals, and sent monks throughout the land to preach the Gospel. Nerses held a synod at Ashtishat that, among other things, forbade people to marry their first cousin and forbade mutilation and other extreme actions in mourning.Lang, David Marshall. Armenia: Cradle of Civilization (Boston: George Allen & Unwin, 1970) p. 160 Some of these reforms drew upon him the king's displeasure, and he was exiled, supposedly to Edessa. It was probably at some point during the latter part of Arshak's reign that Nerses went to Constantinople to ensure the emperor's support of Armenia against the Persians. According to historian Faustus of Byzantium, Roman emperor Valens became outraged at Nerses condemning his following of the teachings of Arius and sent Nerses into exile.Pawstos, Armenia, p. 99 While Nerses was in exile in Xad, he was the leader of the church in Armenia. Upon the accession of pro-Arian king Papas (Pap) in 369, Nerses returned to his see. Papas proved a dissolute and unworthy ruler and Nerses forbade him entrance to the church. Under the pretence of seeking reconciliation, Papas invited Nerses to his table and reportedly poisoned him in 373.

Origins  It has been suggested that the name of the Norfolk family is derived from the village of Sporle, near Swaffham.Rye W., Norfolk Families, pp 836‚Äì839 (1913), Norwich: Goose & Son Ltd In 1349 a William de Sporle was admitted freeman of the city of Norwich and later sat on the committee that considered the creation of the office of Mayor of Norwich. Spurrells were resident in Norwich from the fifteenth century onwards, and in 1737 John Spurrell was elected mayor of the city.Cozens-Hardy B. and Kent E. A., The Mayors of Norwich 1403 to 1835 : being biographical notes on the Mayors of the old corporation (1938)  Thurgarton branch  Spurrells are recorded in Thurgarton, near Cromer, from the early 1500s and may have settled there from Norwich. A William Sporrell is listed on the Subsidy Roll in 1522,Rye W., Some Rough Materials for a History of the Hundred of North Erpingham in the County of Norfolk (1883) and the Thurgarton parish records show several generations of the family from 1539 onwards. The Spurrell family (the change in spelling from Sporrell to Spurrell occurred in the mid-16th century) owned several hundred acres of land in Thurgarton, Bessingham, Sustead, Gresham and Erpingham.Palgrave-Moore P. and Sayer M. J., A Selection of Revised and Unpublished Norfolk Pedigrees, Vol. 6, Norfolk & Norwich Genealogical Society (1974): Spurrell of Thurgarton pp. 175‚Äì177 In 1733 William Spurrell, the first of four generations named William to serve as Chief Constable of North Erpingham hundred, rebuilt Thurgarton House in the Georgian style. A Victorian wing and several brick barns were built in the nineteenth century. The house remained in the Spurrell family until 2014.http://www.edp24.co.uk/property/thurgarton_house_farm_yours_for_just_4_4m_1_3593431 In 1894 John Thomas Spurrell, the younger son of Richard James Spurrell of Thurgarton House, inherited several thousand acres in Horsham St Faith and Newton St Faith, near Norwich, from Barbara, Countess von Rechberg (daughter of Thomas Jones, 6th Viscount Ranelagh, and the estranged wife of the Austrian statesman Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Rothenl√∂wen). In the 1930s part of the estate was requisitioned for the construction of RAF Horsham St Faith, which in 1963 became Norwich International Airport.  Bessingham branch  The east window of St Mary's church, Bessingham, installed in memory of Lt.-Col. Robert John Spurrell. In 1766 John Spurrell, the younger son of William Spurrell who built Thurgarton House in 1733, purchased land in neighbouring Bessingham from the Anson family. The Spurrells expanded the estate, benefiting from the enclosure of the common land in the 1820s, and in 1870 Daniel Spurrell built a new Manor House, with lawns, a walled garden and parkland laid out around it. Daniel's daughter Katherine Anne Spurrell bred daffodils in the grounds of the Manor House, some of which received the Award of Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society, and the daffodil Narcissus 'Katherine Spurrell' was named after her by Edward Leeds. Another famous resident of the Manor House in the late nineteenth century was a bear, brought to Bessingham from India by Daniel's son Robert John Spurrell, a cavalry officer who had rowed for the University of Cambridge in the 1878 boat race.Spurrell, Jonathan, Bessingham:The Story of a Norfolk Estate, 1766-1970, 2016http://www.bessinghamhistory.org The Bessingham estate included farms in Roughton, Billockby and Sidestrand (including Sidestrand Hall, which was sold to Sir Samuel Hoare in 1880) and was eventually broken up and sold in 1970. The Manor House now operates as self-catering holiday accommodation.http://www.bessinghammanor.uk  Prominent Spurrells  Through marriage with other North Norfolk families such as the Bacons, Flaxmans and Copemans, the Spurrells became prominent members of the local gentry, serving on local and parish councils. Some members of the family achieved wider recognition: *Helen Spurrell (1819‚Äì1891), who published the first translation of the Old Testament by a woman in 1885 *Rev.

C., The life of Charles Spurrell and his family's links to the Watney and Gray brewing families, Brewery History No. 138 (December 2010)  Other Spurrell families in England and Wales  Spurrell's Cross, Dartmoor. It is not known whether there is any connection between the Norfolk families and those living in Wales and the West Country. There were Spurrells in Devon in the sixteenth century, so any migration would be difficult to prove due to the lack of early records. Spurrell's Cross on Dartmoor marks the spot where the path used by monks to travel from Buckfast Abbey to Plympton Priory met the path from Wrangaton to Erme Pound.http://www.dartmoor-crosses.org.uk/spurrell%27s.htm In the late eighteenth century John Spurrell, an auctioneer from Bath, moved to Wales and settled in Carmarthen. He was the grandson of Robert Spurrell, a Bath schoolmaster who printed the first book, The Elements of Chronology, in the city in 1730. In 1840, a printing press was set up in Carmarthen by William Spurrell (1813‚Äì1889), who wrote a history of the town and compiled and published a Welsh-English dictionary (first published 1848) and an English- Welsh dictionary (first published 1850).Article in Welsh Biography Online, SPURRELL family, of Carmarthen, printers: https://biography.wales/article/s-SPUR-CAE-1775?query=spurrell&field;=name Today's Collins Welsh dictionary is known as the \\"Collins Spurrell\\".

A living Constitution is said to develop alongside the needs of a society, providing a more malleable tool for governments. The idea is associated with views that contemporaneous society should be taken into account when interpreting key constitutional phrases.Winkler, Adam. A Revolution Too Soon: Woman Suffragists and The \\"Living Constitution\\". 76 NYULR 1456, 1463 (\\"Based on the idea that society changes and evolves, living constitutionalism requires that constitutional controversies, in the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., \\"must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago.\\") The constitution referred to as the living law of the land as it is transformed according to necessities of the time and situation.Dr. Ansari Zartab Jabeen, Indian judiciary and transformative constitutionalism, The LexWarrier: Online Law Journal (2019) 2, pp. 107 - 115 While the arguments for the Living Constitution vary, they can generally be broken into two categories. First, the pragmatist view contends that interpreting the Constitution in accordance with its original meaning or intent is sometimes unacceptable as a policy matter, and thus that an evolving interpretation is necessary.Chawawa, M. (2019) The United States Constitution and The Bible Conflict or Compromise, WestBow Press, Bloomfield. Ch 3. The second, relating to intent, contends that the constitutional framers specifically wrote the Constitution in broad and flexible terms to create such a dynamic, \\"living\\" document. Opponents of the idea often argue that the Constitution should be changed through an amendment process because allowing judges to change the Constitution's meaning undermines democracy. Another argument against a living constitution is that legislative action, rather than judicial decisions, can better represent the will of the people in a constitutional republic since periodic elections allow individuals to vote on who will represent them in Congress and members of Congress should (in theory) be responsive to the views of their constituents. This argument relies, in part, on the fact that federal judges (who are not elected, but rather appointed by the President) have life tenure and are far less at risk of losing their jobs than members of Congress (who must be elected). The primary alternative to a living constitution theory is \\"originalism\\". Some supporters of the living method of interpretation, such as professors Michael Kammen and Bruce Ackerman, refer to themselves as organists.The Holmes Lectures: The Living Constitution, by Bruce AckermanSovereignty and liberty: constitutional discourse in American culture, by Michael KammenCan Pragmatists be Constitutionalists? Dewey, Jefferson and the Experimental Constitution, \\"organicism (or that a constitution is a living document, the meaning of which evolves with the changing values and norms of each new generation)\\", \\"Following the earlier Canadian constitutional tradition, the courts have shown little interest in an originalist approach and have taken a much more organicist stance in line with the \\"living tree\\" imperative.\\" Living constitution =Background= During the Progressive Era, many initiatives were promoted and fought for, but were prevented from coming to full fruition in either legislative bodies or judicial proceedings. One case in particular, Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., enraged early progressive activists hoping to achieve an income tax.Supreme Court A to Z This led progressives to the belief that the Constitution was unamendable, and ultimately to find a new way to achieve the desired level of progress.The American State from the Civil War to the New Deal, by Paul D. Moreno, p. 135, Cambridge University PressProgressive Historians, by Richard Hofstadter Other proposals were considered, such as making the methods for directly amending the Constitution easier.TRANSFORMING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY: TR AND THE BULL MOOSE CAMPAIGN OF 1912, Miller Center of Public Affairs =Origins= The phrase originally derives from the title of a 1927 book of that name by Professor Howard Lee McBain, while early efforts at developing the concept in modern form have been credited to figures including Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Louis D. Brandeis, and Woodrow Wilson.Winkler at 1457Wilson often referred to the Constitution as a \\"vehicle of life.\\" See Kammen, Michael. A Vehicle of Life: The Founders' Intentions and American Perceptions of Their Living Constitution. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 131, No. 3, A More Perfect Union: Essays on the Constitution (Sep., 1987) The earliest mentions of the Constitution as \\"living\\", particularly in the context of a new way of interpreting it, comes out of Woodrow Wilson's book Constitutional Government in the United StatesWilson, Woodrow. (1908) Constitutional Government in the United States where he wrote: > Living political constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in > practice.Wilson, Woodrow. (1908) Constitutional Government in the United > States pg. 57. Wilson strengthened this view, at least publicly, while he campaigned for President in 1912. He said: > Society is a living organism and must obey the laws of life, not of > mechanics; it must develop. All that progressives ask or desire is > permission - in an era when \\"development,\\" \\"evolution,\\" is the scientific > word - to interpret the Constitution according to the Darwinian principle; > all they ask is recognition of the fact that a nation is a living thing and > not a machine.Pestritto, Ronald J. (2005) Woodrow Wilson: The Essential > Political Writings pg. 121. This is part of his \\"The New Freedom\\" series of > speeches. One could also reasonably argue that Thomas Jefferson himself presented the idea of evolving Constitutional interpretations. In an 1816 letter to Samuel Kercheval, excerpted on Panel 4 of the Jefferson Memorial, he wrote > But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the > progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more > enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners > and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must > advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man > to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to > remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors. =Judicial pragmatism= Although \\"the living Constitution\\" is itself a characterization rather than a specific method of interpretation, the phrase is associated with various non-originalist theories of interpretation. The most common association is with judicial pragmatism.Goldford, Dennis J (2005). The American Constitution and the Debate Over Originalism. Cambridge University Press, Pg. 59. (\\"Harold Koh justifies such a position by distinguishing between a rigid literalism he ascribes to originalism and a flexible pragmatism that views the Constitution as a living document that must adapt to modern times.\\")Harold Koh, 41 Duke Law Journal 122, 128 (1991)(note 34). In the course of his judgment in Missouri v. Holland 252 U.S. 416 (1920), Holmes made this remark on the nature of the constitution. According to the pragmatist view, the Constitution should be seen as evolving over time as a matter of social necessity. Looking solely to original meaning, when the original intent was largely to permit many practices universally condemned today, is under this view cause to reject pure originalism out of hand. This general view has been expressed by Judge Richard Posner: This pragmatist objection is central to the idea that the Constitution should be seen as a living document. Under this view, for example, constitutional requirements of \\"equal rights\\" should be read with regard to current standards of equality, and not those of decades or centuries ago, because the alternative would be unacceptable. =Original intent= In addition to pragmatist arguments, most proponents of the living Constitution argue that the Constitution was deliberately written to be broad and flexible to accommodate social or technological change over time. Edmund Randolph, in his Draft Sketch of Constitution, wrote this: The living constitution's proponents assert that Randolph's injunction to use \\"simple and precise language, and general propositions,\\" such that the Constitution could \\"be accommodated to times and events,\\" is evidence of the \\"genius\\" of the Constitutional framers. James Madison, principal author of the U.S. Constitution and often called the \\"Father of the Constitution,\\" said this in argument for original intent and against changing the Constitution by evolving language: Some living Constitutionists seek to reconcile themselves with the originalist view; e.g., one that interprets the Constitution as it was originally intended to be interpreted.Marshall, Lawrence. Contempt of Congress: A Reply to the Critics of an Absolute Rule of Statutory Stare Decisis, 88 Michigan Law review 2467, 2478 (1990)(footnote omitted). (\\"Consistent with the notion of the Constitution as a living document, definitions and applications of terms like \\"due process,\\" \\"cruel and unusual punishment,\\" and \\"unreasonable search and seizure\\" evolve over time. The specter of judges inserting content into these phrases is not an unfortunate or inevitable by-product of the framers' poor drafting or lack of foresight; it is a critical part of the process of breathing life into a document originated by those long dead.\\") Quoted by Goldford =Applying a living constitution= One application of the living Constitution framework is seen in the Supreme Court's reference to \\"evolving standards of decency\\" under the Eighth Amendment. This was seen in the 1958 Supreme Court case of Trop v. Dulles:Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958) While the Court was referring in Trop only to the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the underlying conception ‚Äì namely, that the Constitution is written in broad terms, and that the Court's interpretation of those terms should reflect current societal conditions ‚Äì is the heart of the \\"living Constitution\\" doctrine.Balkin, Jack. Alive and Kicking: Why no one truly believes in a dead Constitution. August 29, 2005 http://www.slate.com/id/2125226/ Retrieved 4/20/07 (\\"Original meaning does not mean original expected application. For example, the Constitution bans cruel and unusual punishments. But the application of the concepts of \\"cruel and unusual\\" must be that of our own day, not 1791.\\") Equal protection and due process clauses The Warren Court, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, is recognized as having dramatically expanded civil liberties protected under the Constitution. From its inception, one of the most controversial aspects of the living Constitutional framework has been its association with broad interpretations of the equal protection and due process clauses of the 5th and 14th Amendments. Proponents of the Living Constitution suggest that a dynamic view of civil liberties is vital to the continuing effectiveness of our Constitutional scheme. Not only is it currently seen as unacceptable to suggest that married women or descendants of slaves are not entitled to liberty or equal protection with regard to coverture laws, slavery laws and their legacy as they were not expressly seen as free from such by all ratifiers at the time of the Constitutional ratification, but neither do advocates of the living Constitution believe that the framers intended, or certainly demanded, that their 18th century practices be regarded as the permanent standard for these ideals. Living Constitutionalists suggest that broad ideals such as \\"liberty\\" and \\"equal protection\\" were included in the Constitution precisely because they are timeless, due to their inherently dynamic nature. Liberty in 1791, it is argued, was never thought to be the same as liberty in 1591 or 1991, but rather was seen as a principle transcending the recognized rights of that day and age. Giving them a fixed and static meaning in the name of \\"originalism,\\" thus, is said to violate the very theory it purports to uphold. Points of contention As the subject of significant controversy, the idea of a Living Constitution is plagued by numerous conflicting contentions. =Disregard of Constitutional language= The idea of a Living Constitution was often characterized by Justice Scalia and others as inherently disregarding Constitutional language, suggesting that one should not simply read and apply the constitutional text. Jack Balkin argues that this is not the intended meaning of the term, however, which suggests rather that the Constitution be read contemporaneously, rather than historically.Balkin, Jack.

They properly regard all of these as legitimate sources of interpretation.\\") =Judicial activism= Another common view of the Living Constitution is as synonymous with \\"judicial activism,\\" a phrase generally used to accuse judges of resolving cases based on their own political convictions or preferences. =Comparisons= In sum, it may be noted that the Living Constitution does not itself represent a detailed philosophy, and that distinguishing it from other theories can be difficult. Indeed, Living Constitutionalists often suggest that it is the true originalist philosophy, while originalists generally agree that phrases such as \\"just compensation\\" should be applied differently than 200 years ago. It has been suggested that the true difference between these judicial philosophies does not regard \\"meaning\\" at all, but rather, the correct application of Constitutional principles.Balkin, Jack M., \\"Abortion and Original Meaning\\" (August 28, 2006). Yale Law School, Public Law Working Paper No. 119 Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=925558 A Living Constitutionalist would not necessarily state, for instance, that the meaning of \\"liberty\\" has changed since 1791. It may be what it always has always been: a general principle recognizing individual freedom. The important change then might be in what is recognized as liberty today, that was not fully recognized two centuries ago. This view was enunciated for the Supreme Court by Justice George Sutherland in 1926: To complete the example, the question of how to apply a term like \\"liberty\\" may not be a question of what it \\"means,\\" but rather a question of what liberties are presently entitled to constitutional protection. Living Constitutionalists tend to advocate a broad application in accordance with current views, while originalists tend to seek an application consistent with views at the time of ratification. Critics of the Living Constitution assert that it is more open to judicial manipulation, while proponents argue that theoretical flexibility in either view provides adherents extensive leeway in what decision to reach in a particular case.Sunsetin, Cass (2006). Of Snakes and Butterflies: A Reply. 106 Columbia Law Review 2234. (\\"In the last decade and more, some (of course very far from all) conservative judges have been reading the Constitution in a way that lines up uncomfortably well with their own political views: to invalidate affirmative action programs, campaign finance laws, and restrictions on gun control; to strike down certain laws protecting the environment and forbidding discrimination on the basis of disability and age; to protect commercial advertising; to permit discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation; to allow government to provide financial and other assistance to religious institutions; to give the President broad, unilateral authority to fight the war on terror; and to contain no right of reproductive choice or sexual liberty. No one doubts that some of these readings of the Constitution are reasonable. But Radicals in Robes was partly designed to show that, for all the talk of \\"strict construction,\\" and for all the insistence on distinguishing between law and politics, we are in the midst of a period in which some prominent conservatives are attempting to use judicial power for their own political ends. To be sure, judges almost always act in good faith. But it is nonetheless true that references to history, and to the views of the Framers and ratifiers, are sometimes a fraud and a fa√ßade.\\")Balkin, Jack. Alive and Kicking: Why no one truly believes in a dead Constitution. August 29, 2005 http://www.slate.com/id/2125226/ Retrieved 4/20/07 (\\"Because the basic jurisprudential claim that original understanding is the only legitimate method of interpretation is overstated, originalists usually make a second, more pragmatic argument: A living Constitution offers insufficient constraints on judicial power. The irony of this charge is that in practice originalism doesn't provide any greater constraint. As we've seen, originalist judges pick and choose when to invoke original understanding and when to rely on existing precedents they like.\\") Debate Chief Justice William Rehnquist criticized the notion of a Living Constitution. By its nature, the \\"living Constitution\\" is not held to be a specific theory of construction, but a vision of a Constitution whose boundaries are dynamic, congruent with the needs of society as it changes. This method also has its critics; in the description of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, it \\"has about it a teasing imprecision that makes it a coat of many colors.\\"Rehnquist, William.The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Texas Law Review 693 (1976), reprinted in 29 Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy 401 (2006). It is important to note that the term \\"living Constitution\\" is sometimes used by critics as an aspersion, while some advocates of the general philosophy avoid the phrase. Opponents of the doctrine tend to use the term as an epithet synonymous with judicial activism (itself a hotly debated phrase). However, just as some conservative theorists have embraced the term Constitution in Exile (which similarly gained popularity through use by liberal critics), and textualism was a term which once had pejorative connotations before its widespread acceptance as a badge of honor, some liberal theorists have embraced the image of a living document as appealing.Lithwick, Dahlia. Reasons To Go On Living: Does anyone believe in a \\"living Constitution\\" anymore? August 23, 2005. http://www.slate.com/id/2124891/ Retrieved 4/20/07. =Arguments in favor= Two of the arguments in support of the concept of a \\"living Constitution\\" is the concept that the Constitution itself is silent on the matter of constitutional interpretation. Proponents of the living Constitution assert that the Constitutional framers, most of whom were trained lawyers and legal theorists, were certainly aware of these debates; they also would have known the confusion that not providing a clear interpretive method would cause. Had the framers meant for future generations to interpret the Constitution in a specific manner, they could have indicated such within the Constitution itself.Sunstein 106 CLMR 2234, 2236 (\\"The Constitution does not set out the instructions for its own interpretation. A theory of interpretation has to be defended, rather than asserted, and the defense must speak candidly in terms of the system of constitutional law that it will yield.\\") The lack of guidance within the text of the Constitution suggests, therefore, that either: a) there was no such consensus, or b) the framers never intended any fixed method of constitutional interpretation. Relating to the pragmatic argument, it is further argued that if judges were denied the opportunity to reflect on changes to modern society in interpreting the scope of Constitutional rights, the resulting Constitution either would not reflect current mores and values, or would necessitate a constant amendment process to reflect our changing society. Another defense of the Living Constitution is based in viewing the Constitution not merely as law, but as a source of foundational concepts for the governing of society. Of course, laws must be fixed and clear so that people can understand and abide by them on a daily basis. But if the Constitution is more than a set of laws, if it provides guiding concepts which themselves will in turn provide the foundations for laws, then the costs and benefits of such an entirely fixed meaning are very different. The reason for this is simple: if a society locks itself into a previous generation's interpretive ideas, it will wind up either constantly attempting to change the Constitution to reflect changes, or simply scrapping the Constitution altogether. While we remain bound by the rights and powers provided in the Constitution, thus, the scope those rights and powers should account for society's present experiences. \\"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., wrote in 1914: 'Provisions of the Constitution of the United States are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form, but are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is not to be gathered simply from the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.'\\"James, Leanoard Frank (1964). The Supreme Court in American Life. Chicago: Scott, Foresman. Pg. 159.Gompers v. United States 233 U.S. 604 (1914) A prominent endorsement of the Living Constitution concept was heard in the 2000 presidential campaign by the Democratic candidate, Al Gore.\\"You know, I believe the Constitution is a living and breathing document and that there are liberties found in the Constitution such as the right to privacy that spring from the document, itself, even though the Founders didn't write specific words saying this, this, and this, because we have interpreted our founding charter over the years and found deeper meanings in it, in light of the subsequent experience in American life of the last 211 years of our republic, and a strict constructionist, narrow-minded, harkening back to a literalist reading from 200 years ago, I think that's ‚Äì I think that's a mistake. And I would certainly not want to appoint any justices that took that approach.\\" Al Gore interview from the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. Public Broadcasting Service. March 14, 2000 https://www.pbs.org/newshour/election2000/candidates/gore_3-14c.html Retrieved 2010-09-12 =Arguments against= The strongest argument against the doctrine of \\"Living Constitution\\" comes not from its moderate use, but when the concept is seen as promoting activism. The term presumes the premise of \\"that which is written is insufficient in light of what has transpired since\\". This more moderate concept is generally not the target of those who are against the \\"Living Constitution\\". The concept considered perverse by constructionalists is \\"making the law say what you think it should say, rather than submitting to what it does say\\". Economist Thomas Sowell argues in his book Knowledge and Decisions that since the original designers of the Constitution provided for the process of changing it, they never intended for their original words to change meaning. Sowell also points out cases where arguments are made that the original framers never considered certain issues, when clear record of them doing so exists. Another argument against the concept of a \\"living Constitution\\" ironically, is similar to the argument for it; the fact that the Constitution itself is silent on the matter of constitutional interpretation. The doctrine of the \\"living Constitution\\" relies on the concept that the original framers either could not come to a consensus about how to interpret, or they never intended any fixed method of interpretation. This would then allow future generations the freedom to reexamine for themselves how to interpret the Constitution. This view does not take into account why the original constitution does not allow for judicial interpretation in any form. The Supreme Court's power for constitutional review, and by extension its interpretation, did not come about until Marbury v. Madison in 1803. The concept for a \\"living constitution\\" therefore relies on an argument regarding the writing of the constitution that had no validity when the constitution was written. The views of constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe are often described by conservative critics such as Robert Bork as being characteristic of the \\"living Constitution paradigm\\" they condemn. Bork labels Tribe's approach as \\"protean,\\" meaning that it was whatever Tribe needed it to be to reach a desired policy outcome (Tribe rejects both the term and the description). Such a construction appears to define \\"living Constitution\\" doctrine as being an ends dictate the means anti-law philosophy. Some liberal constitutional scholars have since implied a similar charge of intellectual dishonesty regarding originalists, noting that they virtually never reach outcomes with which they disagree. (Many academic political scientists believe that justices and appeals judges are willing to alter their outcomes to attain philosophical majorities on certain questions.) In 1987, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered a lecture, \\"The Constitution: A Living Document,\\" in which he argued that the Constitution must be interpreted in light of the moral, political, and cultural climate of the age of interpretation. If Judge Bork's formulation of \\"the living Constitution\\" is guiding, then any interpretation of the Constitution other than originalism (of one form or another) implicates a living Constitution. If, however, Justice Marshall's formulation is guiding, then it is unclear whether methods derived from law and economics or the Moral Constitution might be implicated. References to \\"the living Constitution\\" are relatively rare among legal academics and judges, who generally prefer to use language that is specific and less rhetorical. It is also worth noting that there is disagreement among opponents of \\"the living Constitution\\" about whether the idea is the same as, implied by, or assumed by judicial activism, which has a similar ambiguity of meaning and is also used primarily as an epithet. Justice Clarence Thomas has routinely castigated \\"living Constitution\\" doctrine. In one particularly strongly worded attack, he noted that: Justice Antonin Scalia has expressed similar sentiments. He commented: He also said: Professor Michael Ramsey has criticized living constitutionalism on the grounds that there are very little limits on what it could achieve. Ramsey uses Kenneth Jost's argument in favor of the unconstitutionality of the Electoral College to argue that a living constitutionalist could believe that \\"[e]ven something expressly set forth in the Constitution can be unconstitutional if annoying, inconvenient or ill- advised.\\" Likewise, Professors Nelson Lund and John McGinnis have argued that it would be difficult for a living constitutionalist such as Robert Post to object if the U.S. Supreme Court would have used its reverse incorporation principle together with the principles of Reynolds v. Sims to make the U.S. Senate apportioned exclusively based on population and nevertheless retained the trust of the American people after doing this.https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1719&context;=mlr Activism One accusation made against the living Constitution method states that judges that adhere to it are \\"Activists\\" and seek to legislate from the bench. What is generally meant by this is that a judge winds up substituting his judgment regarding the validity, meaning, or scope of a law for that of the democratically elected legislature. Adherents of a living Constitution method are often accused of \\"reading rights\\" into the Constitution; that is, they are accused of claiming that the Constitution implies rights found nowhere in the constitutional text. For example, in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that implicit within the Constitution was a \\"right to privacy\\" and that this right extends to a woman's right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. As such, the Court held that the government could only regulate this right with a compelling interest, and even then, only if the regulation was as minimally intrusive as possible. Conservative critics have since accused the Supreme Court of activism in inventing a Constitutional right to abortion. This accusation is accurate (in that abortion rights indeed had not previously been recognized), however, it has been applied selectively. For example, few conservatives levy the same claim against the Supreme Court for its decisions concerning sovereign immunity: a term also found in the Eleventh Amendment by the Supreme Court. Internationally =Canada= In Canada, the living constitution is described under the living tree doctrine. Unlike the case of the United States, the fact that the constitution of Canada was intended from the outset to encompass unwritten conventions and legal principles is beyond question. For example, the text of the constitution does not mention the office of prime minister or that the governor general always grants royal assent to bills. Principles such as democracy, the Implied Bill of Rights, the rule of law, and judicial independence are held to derive in part from the preamble of the constitution, which declared the constitution of Canada to be \\"similar in principle\\" to that of the United Kingdom. The concept of an evolving constitution has notably been applied to determine the division of powers between provinces and the federal government in areas of jurisdiction not contemplated at the time of enactment of the British North America Act. For example, authority over broadcasting has been held to fall within the federal \\"peace, order and good government\\" power. The Supreme Court of Canada, in Re: Same-Sex Marriage (2004), held that Parliament (as opposed to provincial legislatures) had the power to define marriage as including same-sex unions. It rejected claims that the constitutionally enumerated federal authority in matters of \\"Marriage and Divorce\\" could not include same- sex marriage because marriage as conceived in 1867 was necessarily opposite- sex: =United Kingdom= It has been argued that a primary determinative factor in whether a legal system will develop a \\"living constitutional\\" framework is the ease with which constitutional amendments can be passed.Frey, Bruno S. and Stutzer, Alois, Direct Democracy: Designing a Living Constitution (September 17, 2003). Zurich IEER Working Paper No. 167. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=452081 With this view in mind, the British constitution could be considered a \\"living constitution\\". It only requires a simple majority voteThe UK constitution is \\"subject to simple majority voting. As such, the traditional constitution is, formally, a flexible constitution.\\" to amend.That the UK constitution only needs a simple majority to amend \\"is the case with all current constitutional statute.\\" It is also important to note that the constitution of the United Kingdom does not derive from a single written document. Therefore, its dependence on the important role of Statute law, and the influence of its own version of the supreme court, is what also makes it a living constitution. For instance, after the Second World War, human-rights based philosophy also became profoundly influential in creating a new international legal order,Jowell, J, & Oliver, D (eds) 2011, Changing Constitution, Oxford University Press, Oxford. p. 74. which the United Kingdom conformed with. It is also important to note the different levels to which the United Kingdom and the United States hold a living constitution, with the United States still referring to an original document, quite contrasting the United Kingdom's unwritten document. =India= The Constitution of India is considered to be a living and breathing document.India‚Äôs Living Constitution See also * * References External links * Alive and Kicking: Why no one truly believes in a dead Constitution, by Jack M.

He is best known for his design of iconic stations constructed on the London Underground railway system in central London during the first decade of the 20th century, with distinctive oxblood red tiled fa√ßades including pillars and semi-circular first-floor windows, and patterned tiled interiors. Early and private life Green was born in Maida Vale, London in 1875, the second of four children of architect and Crown Surveyor Arthur Green and his wife Emily. He spent periods studying at Dover College and South Kensington School of Art, and in Paris, between periods working as an assistant in his father's architectural practice. Green married Mildred Ethel Wildy (1879-1960) in Clapham in April 1902. In 1904, they had a daughter, Vera (1904-1995). Career Green established his own practice as an architect in 1897, working initially from his father's offices, before moving to Haymarket in 1900 and then to Adelphi House on Adam Street, by the Strand, in 1903. He became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1898, and a member in 1899. Early commissions included works to homes and shops in various parts of the capital city. In 1903 he was appointed as architect for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) to design stations for three underground railway lines then under construction ‚Äì the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR;), the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR;) and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;), which, respectively, became parts of the present day Piccadilly line, Bakerloo line and Northern line. Green was commissioned to design 50 new stations, including their external appearance, and internal fittings and decoration. Green developed a uniform Arts and Crafts style for the ground level station buildings, adapted to suit the individual station location. They were constructed as two-storey buildings with a structural steel frame ‚Äì then a new form of construction recently imported from the United States ‚Äì providing the large internal spaces needed for ticket halls and lift shafts (the first escalators were introduced in 1911). The exterior elevations were clad in non-loadbearing ox-blood red (sang de boeuf) glazed terracotta (fa√Øence) blocks, provided by the Leeds Fireclay Company. The ground floor was divided into wide bays by columns, allowing separate entrances and exits, and also providing space for retail outlets. The design also featured large semi-circular windows at first floor level (occasionally with circular occuli) and a heavy dentilated cornice above. A broad strip between the two floors announced the name of the station in capital letters. The station buildings were constructed with flat roofs with the deliberate aim of encouraging commercial office development above, another benefit of the load-bearing structural steel frame. The interior was tiled in green and white, with decorative details. At platform level, the stations were provided with a standardised tiling design incorporating the station name, but with quickly identified individual colour schemes and geometric tile patterns formed in repeating panels along the platform length. Directional signs were also included in the tile designs. The tiled surfaces created a unifying theme, and proved easy to maintain. The railways were to open in 1906 and 1907, and Green was notified in June 1907 that the contract would be terminated at the end of that year. He was elected a Fellow of the RIBA in 1907, including details of his work for the UERL as part of his submission. Many of Green's station buildings survive, although internal modifications have seen most of his ticket hall designs altered to suit later developments. At platform levels a number of the original tiling schemes survive today or have, as at Lambeth North and Marylebone, been reproduced in recent years to the original pattern. A number of the surviving buildings are Grade II listed buildings: Aldwych, Belsize Park, Caledonian Road, Chalk Farm, Covent Garden, Gloucester Road, Holloway Road, Oxford Circus, Mornington Crescent, Russell Square and South Kensington. His work was continued by his assistant, Stanley Heaps. The designs remain instantly recognisable: the screen appearance of the fictitious Walford East Underground station from the BBC soap opera EastEnders is inspired by Green's designs.

Pope John XXIII initially had only the 9th grade, with 47 students enrolled in its first year of classes. As time passed, the school added more grade levels. Circa October 2007 Lynn Veazey, who was serving as the principal, resigned. Don Lupton served as the interim principal until April 2008, when the school appointed the position to Tim Petersen, who previously served as the principal of Bishop Manogue Catholic High School in Reno, Nevada. At that time Lupton became the dean of students. In 2008 the school had 165 students, and in the spring of that year the school held its first graduation. By April of that year the student count was 206. The student body increased to 270 for the 2009-2010 school year and then 314 for the 2010-2011 school year. The second phase was scheduled to start construction in early 2011, and in January 2012 the phase opened. The school had 400 students in the 2013-2014 school year. The school held its 10h anniversary celebration on October 11, 2013, and the canonization of Pope John XIII was expected the following year.

Students from the Katy, Spring Branch, Cypress, Memorial, Rosenberg and Sugar Land areas attend the school. it also served the Spring area. As of the 2013-2014 school year there were 10 students per teacher, and the average class size was 16. Upon admission, students are sorted into one of five houses, much like the Oxford colleges system. These houses are Aquinas, Borromeo, Lisieux, Loreto, and Neri, each named after an important saint of the Catholic church. Each house has its own form of internal student government, senior house captains, and has faculty and staff associates who work with the members of their house. Each house competes in Academic and Athletic competitions to earn points towards the Roncalli Cup as well as earning points from other ways such as coin drops at various sports events and competitions regarding charity donations such as who has donated the most items. The Roncalli Cup is named after the original last name of Pope John XXIII. As of 2018, each house except Borromeo has won the Roncalli Cup at least once. This house system is the first to be implemented in Catholic high schools in the state of Texas. Campus Saint John XXIII High School is located on a parcel of land at the intersection of the Grand Parkway and Franz Road. Initially a smaller gymnasium with attached locker rooms served the school's athletic needs. The first phase included 19 classrooms, a cafeteria, and an office. The current gymnasium, built at a cost of $4 million, opened as part of the second phase of construction. It is on the eastern end of the campus. In addition to the new gymnasium, there was also a student center building that had a chapel, five classrooms, two laboratories, and a fitness center and attached locker room. The school is preparing to continue expansion after the newly constructed Crosthwait Student Center and a Competition Gymnasium nicknamed by the students the 'New Gym.' Academic performance In 2012, the school was honored by the Cardinal Newman Society for Excellence in Catholic Identity as a part of the Catholic High Schools Honor Roll; it was one of only seven schools in the nation to receive such a distinction, and it was the only one in Greater Houston to do so. Athletics The school's mascot, nicknamed PJ, is the lion. The school offers 15 different athletic teams, including football, volleyball, boys' and girls' basketball, baseball, softball, swimming, tennis, boys' and girls' soccer, cross country, track and field, golf, lacrosse (offered by an offcampus club) dance/drill team, and cheerleading. The women's swim team won the state title in TAPPS 4A in February 2012 and 2013. The girls' soccer team won the state title championship in TAPPS 3A in 2010. The TAPPS 4A Men's Cross Country champion has been from Pope John XXIII High School in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 school years. In 2013, the football team went to the TAPPS 4A State title game, and in 2014 the Boys' Golf team won their first state title. In 2018, the Girls' Softball team made it to the finals in TAPPS and ended the season in second place.

The majority of these manuscripts were from √Årni‚Äôs native Iceland, but he also acquired many important Norwegian, Danish and Swedish manuscripts, as well as a number of continental provenance. In addition to the manuscripts proper, the collection contains about 14000 Icelandic, Norwegian (including Faroese, Shetland and Orcadian) and Danish charters, both originals and first-hand copies (apographa). After being housed since √Årni's death at the University of Copenhagen, in the Arnamagn√¶an Institute, under a 1965 parliamentary ruling the collection is now divided between there and the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. History When √Årni died in 1730 he bequeathed his collection to the University of Copenhagen, whereupon it became part of the University Library. The collection has been augmented over the years through individual purchases and gifts and the acquisition of a number of smaller collections, for example that of the Danish grammarian Rasmus Rask, bringing the total number of items to around 3000. In 1956 the Arnamagn√¶an Institute (, now Den Arnamagn√¶anske Samling) was established to care for and further the study of the manuscripts in the collection. Even before its constitutional separation from Denmark in 1944, Iceland had begun to petition for the return of these manuscripts. After much heated debate, the Danish parliament decided in May 1965 that such documents in the Arnamagn√¶an Collection as might be held to be \\"Icelandic cultural property\\" (islandsk kultureje) ‚Äî broadly defined as a work composed or translated by an Icelander and whose content is wholly or chiefly concerned with Iceland ‚Äî were to be transferred to the newly established Icelandic Manuscript Institute (now the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies, ), a part of the University of Iceland. It further provided for the transfer from the Danish Royal Library (Det kongelige Bibliotek) of manuscripts belonging to the same categories as the manuscripts relinquished by the Arnamagn√¶an Institute, and contained a special clause relating to the transfer to Iceland of two manuscripts, the Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda and the vellum codex Flateyjarb√≥k, both of which were in the Danish Royal Library (and would not have been deemed islandsk kultureje under the terms of the treaty). These were handed over to Iceland in a ceremony held immediately after the ratification of the treaty in 1971. The first consignment of manuscripts was dispatched from Copenhagen to Reykjav√≠k in June 1973 and the last two were handed over in June 1997. Altogether a total of 1,666 manuscripts, and all the Icelandic charters and apographa, have been transferred to Iceland, slightly over half the collection, in addition to 141 manuscripts from the Danish Royal Library. Of the manuscripts remaining in Copenhagen about half are Icelandic but are either copies made in Copenhagen, have as their chief concern matters not directly related to Iceland, e.g. the histories of the kings of Norway and Denmark, religious texts or translations from Latin and other languages. The remainder of the collection comprises the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and continental European manuscripts mentioned above. In 2009 the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection was added to UNESCO‚Äôs Memory of the World Register in recognition of its historical value. In 2019 the Arnamagn√¶an Institute announced that one of the manuscripts in the collection (AM 377 fol.) was identified as Ferdinand Columbus‚Äôs Libro de los Ep√≠tomes.

Devco Railway operated as an unincorporated department within the Coal Division of the Cape Breton Development Corporation, also known as DEVCO; as such there is no formally incorporated entity named \\"Devco Railway\\". Devco Railway took over the operations of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway on March 30, 1968 when DEVCO expropriated the S&L; as part of the assets of the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, or DOSCO. Creation of DEVCO In 1966, DOSCO (then a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group) announced that its mines had only 18 years of production left and concluded that expense of opening new underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field would be too expensive. The company made its intentions clear that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months. In response to a vast public outcry in industrial Cape Breton County, the Minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO's coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the Sydney area economy off the coal industry. ::\\"Future planning should be based on the assumption that the Sydney mines will not operate beyond 1981.\\" On July 7, 1967 the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. On March 30, 1968 DEVCO expropriated DOSCO's coal mines and the S&L;, settling for a payment of $12 million. At the same time, the Government of Nova Scotia took over the operation of DOSCO's integrated steel mill in Sydney, renaming the operation Sydney Steel Corporation, or SYSCO. The S&L; was reorganized as the Devco Railway. Devco Railway Initially, the Devco Railway continued to operate much as its predecessor, using former S&L; locomotives, cars, trackage, and locomotive shops. Indeed, for several years it continued to operate under its old name of the Sydney & Louisburg Division of the Cumberland Railway. In 1972, with H.S. Haslam as general manager, the road operated of route with offices at Sydney. At that date the company owned 15 diesel locomotives and 1,100 freight cars.Henry Sampson (ed.), Jane's World Railways 1972-73, pp. 264-265. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1972. As DEVCO had been created to shut down the Cape Breton coal industry, the Devco Railway did not have expansion in mind at the outset. Initial operations consisted of serving the old mines, hauling coal to the international shipping piers on Sydney Harbour (Louisbourg's piers were abandoned during the 1960s). The line east of Glace Bay to Louisbourg fell into disuse as older mines were closed. As part of a regional economic development initiative, DEVCO created a tourist railway named the Cape Breton Steam Railway, to operate between Glace Bay and Louisbourg. In 1973, the Sydney and Louisburg Railway Historical Society was created by retired employees of that company to assist with the tourist railway and to preserve the Louisbourg station. The tourist railway used former S&L; equipment and stations, however by the late 1970s it was proving uneconomic to operate and was closed. The track east of Glace Bay was abandoned at this time. The October 1973 Yom Kippur War and the ensuing 1973 oil crisis led the federal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to re- examine all Canadian energy production, including the potential nationalization of Alberta's oil, as well as an expansion of DEVCO coal production, reversing the recommendation of the 1966 Donald Commission to phase out production and diversify the Sydney area economy. The Trudeau government sought to use its ownership of DEVCO to reverse Nova Scotia's reliance on the importation of foreign oil for generating electricity; approximately 70% of the province's electricity was generated by foreign oil by the late 1970s. New mines were built and opened near New Waterford (Phalen and Lingan collieries) and on Boularderie Island (Prince colliery) starting in 1972. Devco Railway built a spur to serve the adjacent Phalen and Lingan mines, extending the line to serve Nova Scotia Power Incorporated's Lingan Generating Station which opened November 1, 1979. During the early 1980s, DEVCO built new locomotive shops at Victoria Junction, between Sydney and Glace Bay, and shut down the Glace Bay roundhouse and shops. DEVCO also built a large coal preparation and wash plant at Victoria Junction, as well as new international shipping piers on Sydney Harbour, replacing the antiquated export piers inherited from DOSCO. With federal government financing, DEVCO was in expansion mode and with the high international prices for coal, sought to produce more Cape Breton coal for export than ever before. The Devco Railway modernized its locomotive fleet by retiring the S&L;'s diesels purchased second-hand during the early 1960s and purchasing General Motors Diesel Limited GP38-2s; a unique design feature of these locomotives was their ability to be used as emergency power generators for various DEVCO mines. Likewise, the coal hopper fleets were modernized, with many being purchased from the Eastern Car Company in New Glasgow. By the late 1980s, production problems at DEVCO saw the last of the older mines inherited from DOSCO shut down, with production concentrated at Lingan, Phalen and Prince; the latter not receiving any rail service. The Point Aconi Generating Station was built by Nova Scotia Power Incorporated to receive coal from the Prince colliery directly by conveyor belt, however the Lingan and Phalen mines still hauled coal to the Victoria Junction preparation plant and then to the Lingan Generating Station. The SYSCO steel mill stopped using DEVCO coal to produce coke as a fuel for its blast furnaces in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, SYSCO had modernized by changing to an electric-arc process, smelting recycled metal. Problems with flooding and roof-falls at the Lingan mine saw production cease in 1992, just months short of the colliery's 20-year design limit. The Phalen mine continued to be the only source of online traffic for the Devco Railway, however subsequent flooding and roof-falls at Phalen caused ever increasing production costs at a time of fiscal restraint by the federal government. Faced with rising subsidies, the federal government announced it was getting out of the coal industry in January 1999 by mining out the rest of Phalen by the end of the year and attempting to sell the Prince colliery. In September 1999, Phalen colliery closed for good, with 400 employees laid off and the only on-line traffic source for the Devco Railway severed. The Prince colliery continued with production, however coal was trucked from the mine to the Victoria Junction preparation plant, from which it was then taken by rail to the Lingan Generating Station. Devco Railway also began to be used for importing some coal from locations in the United States and South America, with the international shipping piers beginning to be used in the reverse of their intended design. On November 23, 2001, Prince colliery closed for good, after the federal government failed to entice any private sector investors to purchase the mine. DEVCO was out of the coal mining business, however for a period of approximately 1 month, it was in the coal importation business. The federal government moved swiftly to sell off assets, transferring the mine properties and mineral rights back to the provincial Department of Natural Resources. DEVCO subsequently decommissioned the Victoria Junction coal wash plant and began to immediately prepare remediation of the mine sites. Creation of Sydney Coal Railway On December 18, 2001 DEVCO sold all surface assets, including the international shipping piers, railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera Inc.,\\"Devco Railway - DVR\\" .

Emera subsequently contracted the operation of its newly acquired DEVCO surface assets to Logistec Corporation. Logistec sub-contracted operation of the railway to the Soci√©t√© des chemins de fer du Qu√©bec, a Quebec-based railway holding company and short-line operating company.

Biography  Yavorsky was born in Yavoriv, Ruthenian Voivodeship (near Lviv). Stefan Yavorsky, Great Soviet Encyclopedia He enrolled in the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy around 1673 and completed its course of study; in 1684 he traveled to Poland to continue his education, at which point he was compelled to join the Uniate church, as was common for Kievan students who wanted to study in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; he took the Uniate name Stanislav (). He spent five years abroad, studying philosophy in Lvov and Lublin and theology in Pozna≈Ñ and Vilnius, where he completed his education. In 1689 he returned to Kiev, broke from the Uniate church and returned to Eastern Orthodoxy. He took monastic vows under the name Stefan and settled at the Kiev Academy as a preacher and professor, being appointed prefect of the institution and in 1697 hegumen of the Nikolaevsky monastery (). He also began to preach, which soon made him well known in Kiev. At the beginning of 1700 he visited Moscow on church business, and when the boyar Aleksei Shein died in February Patriarch Adrian commissioned him to give the eulogy, which attracted the attention of Peter I, who was so pleased he had Yavorsky remain in Moscow and ordered a position to be found for him, as a result of which he was made archbishop of Ryazan and Murom in April. When Adrian himself died in October, Yavorsky was appointed locum tenens of the patriarchal see. \\"Thus in the course of seven months Iavorsky ascended from the humble position of father superior to the highest office in the entire church. Iavorsky had never desired such an appointment and even attempted to avoid it, but Peter was unyielding [because] the prelate was not a progressive or a reformer, but he was an authoritative figure with a European education, of which there were still few in Russia\\". Yavorsky's life now changed dramatically. He lived in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Ryazan, returning to Ukraine only rarely and with the express permission of the tsar. As the head of the church, he had to deal with the struggles between the various factions in the church, and he was expected to uphold Peter's reforms. At first he did so, but eventually the reforms restricted the rights of the church that he began to oppose them, and in 1712 a sermon of his, calling the Tsarevich Alexei \\"Russia's only hope\\" and hinting at criticism of the tsar's personal life, so angered Peter that he forbade Yavorsky to preach in public. Yavorsky directed a commission on correcting the translation of the Bible and wrote The Rock of Faith (), a huge treatise on dogma that \\"was sharply anti-Protestant in spirit\\" and whose publication Peter forbade (it was published in 1728 under Peter II). In 1721 he was made first president of the newly erected Holy Synod, but the real power was held by its vice president, Peter's close collaborator Theophan Prokopovich. When Yavorsky died in the following year, Prokopovich took his place as president; shortly before his death, suspected of being involved in a publication that accused Peter of being the Antichrist, he was interrogated in his home by members of the Synod and Senate, and \\"it is possible that only his death saved Iavorsky from punishment\\". Literary activity Yavorsky was one of the most educated figures in the Russian church of his day, and throughout his life \\"he aspired to a quiet life of independent literary activity rather than a great career\\". Around 1685 he published his panegyric Hercules post Atlantem, dedicated to Varlaam Yasinsky, archimandrite of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra; it was \\"a complex rhetorical construction of Latin prose with poems in Latin and Polish\\". In 1690 he published two more panegyrics to Yasinsky, Arctos coeli (Constellation of the heavens) and Pe≈Çnia nieubywajƒÖcej chwa≈Çy (Abundance of unlessening glory), confirming his reputation as a poet. After he became hegumen of the Nikolaevsky monastery, his sermon Vinograd Khristov (The vineyard of Christ) was published in 1698. Soon after he became head of the Russian church, he presided over the trial of Grigory Talitsky, who had proclaimed Peter the Antichrist, and his refutation of Talitsky, Znameniya prishestviya Antikhristova i konchiny veka (Signs of the arrival of the Antichrist and the end of the age), was published in 1703 and reprinted many times during the eighteenth century.

After the success of their previous work over 1989‚Äì1991, the band hired prolific record producer Jon Kelly and recorded the album at AIR Studios in London. The album contains a more \\"muscular\\" yet sometimes more sombre sound than their previous albums, although still entirely retains lyricist Paul Heaton's witty and bitter lyrical style. The album \\"deals in fragile melodies and harmonies, soulful but low-key instrumentation, and lyrics full of subtle social commentary and humour.\\" The album title refers to the 0898 premium rate dialling code associated with sex hotlines in the UK at the time. The album was released in March 1992 by the band's record label Go! Discs. Four singles were released from the album, two of them prior to its release; \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\", \\"We Are Each Other\\", \\"Bell Bottomed Tear\\" and \\"36D\\". It reached number 4 on the UK Album Chart, unlike their previous two albums which reached number 2; the record company blamed this on the cover which showed ladies' faces on the back of terrapins' shells. While the first two singles ‚Äì \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" and \\"We Are Each Other\\" ‚Äì charted in the UK at No. 22 and No. 30 respectively, third single \\"Bell Bottomed Tear\\" was the only Top 20 hit from the album, reaching No. 16. \\"36D\\" was a relative disappointment after this success, only managing No. 46 in the singles charts. \\"We Are Each Other\\" was also a success on American alternative rock radio and peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1992. It was the band's biggest hit in the United States. The album was a critical success, with reviewers praising its production, lyrics and distinct tone, although some critics recognise the album as being under- rated. The album appeared on numerous lists of the best albums of 1992; Vox ranked it 18th,Vox December 1992 issue NME ranked it 44th and Robert Christgau placed it 53rd. The album was certified \\"Gold\\" by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 200,000 copies. Background and recording After forming in 1989, The Beautiful South's debut album Welcome to the Beautiful South, released October the same year, was a major chart success, reaching number 2 in the UK Albums Chart and featuring two top 10 hits, \\"Song For Whoever\\" and \\"You Keep It All In\\". Featuring Paul Heaton's witty lyrics and vocals from him, Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan, it was a critical success too, being widely hailed for \\"reinserting cynicism, doubt, and biting sarcasm into pop music.\\" The album was a transformation for lead singer and lyricist Paul Heaton after his previous band The Housemartins; according to Robert Christgau, he turned \\"his talents to the interpersonal. The surprise was that he didn't then cop out.\\" The third single from the album, \\"I'll Sail This Ship Alone\\", reached number 31. Working in a short space of time, the band quickly released their second album Choke a year later in October 1990. Although it reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart, it was not as much a critical success as its predecessor, despite drawing favourable reviews. Two singles from the album, \\"My Book\\" and \\"Let Love Speak Up Itself\\", charted outside the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, but the album also provided the band's only number 1 hit, a Hemingway/Corrigan duet called \\"A Little Time\\", and its music video, featuring the aftermath of a domestic fight, won the 1991 BRIT Award for Best Video. As with before, the band were quick to begin work on their third album. After working with Mike Hedges on their first two albums, the band hired Jon Kelly to produce the new album, a British producer famous for working with Pele, Prefab Sprout, Deacon Blue, Heather Nova, The Levellers, Fish, Lynsey De Paul, Nolwenn Leroy, The Damned, Kate Bush, The band decamped to Air Studios, London, to record the new album, the official recording studios of Associated Independent Recording. This credit has caused confusion, as the studio closed in 1989 before officially reopening as \\"AIR Lyndhurst\\" in a redeveloped hall in December 1992 after a year's long work. It is unknown which of the two locations the band recorded in. Music and lyrics =Styles and themes= The album was recorded at AIR Studios in London (pictured in 2007). According to Roch Pairisen of Allmusic, \\"there are no big poses or walls of crunchy guitars on [the album]. Instead, the group ‚Äì which includes three lead vocalists -deals in fragile melodies and harmonies, soulful but low-key instrumentation, and lyrics full of subtle social commentary and humour.\\" He noted that \\"at times, the group even couches itself in the guise of a smooth lounge act, rebelling against current trends by having something to say while not making a racket about it,\\" and noted that producer Jon Kelly has \\"contributed an incisive and full-bodied production\\" to the album, \\"a great improvement over the rather thin sound\\" of Choke. According to Craig Tomashoff and David Hiltbrand of Picks and Pans, the album contains \\"sweet pop music with insidious lyrics. It starts with the best pop melodies you can hum‚Äîsort of like Elton John Does Detroit. Harmonious piano arrangements blend with songwriter Paul Heaton's soulful vocals and occasional backing horns to create 12 songs that work like aural lithium.\\" They noted the contrast between the happy music and dark lyrics, saying \\"one hit and you're happy for hours. Until you actually listen to what Heaton and his two co-lead vocalists, Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan, are saying. The tunes suggest light, happy odes to love. The words are dark, sardonic musings on human nature.\\" According to Trouser Press, the album \\"features even more uplifting melodies and more balanced lyrics: 'Old Red Eyes Is Back', 'We Are Each Other' and the Corrigan-sung 'Bell-Bottomed Tear' benefit immeasurably by demonstrating a bit more compassion for their subjects. Heaton hits particular peaks in his dialogue songs. (He writes alternating-verse male/female numbers better than just about anyone.)\\" Marie Lamie, writing in The Rough Guide to Rock, said \\"there are some very sombre moments here, both musically and lyrically, making something of a new direction.\\" A reviewer for Record Rewind Play said \\"the whole album is full of hints of the sinister, but compassion finds a way in.\\" =Songs= Ted Kessler of Select said the first two songs \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" and \\"We are Each Other\\" \\"set the tone\\" for the album. \\"Pianos, strings and percussion are right down in the mix, the lead instruments are the gorgeous voices of Heaton, Hemingway and Briana Corrigan. There isn't a wailing guitar in sight\\". \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\", described as the band's \\"best song ever\\" by Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, is the tale of an \\"old drunken waster looking back on his life, battling to overcome his alcohol dependency . Every time he falls off the wagon and succumbs to drink again....well, old red eyes is back.\\" The song ends sadly, \\"Old Red he died, and every single landlord in the district cried/An empty bottle of whiskey lying by his side...\\" \\"We Are Each Other\\" is \\"typical of the band from this period. Although a guitar is the first sound you hear on the song, it's restrained, and quickly gives way to the melody, harmony, and biting vocals that drive the song.\\" It is more guitar-led than most of their output, and deals with \\"a couple so close that their relationship can no longer function properly.\\" Butler commented that \\"the structure of the song is brilliant (this sort of attention to detail is just one of the many things that elevate The Beautiful South far beyond the vast majority of pop bands) ‚Äì observe how the chorus is split into 2 halves, effectively making 2 brilliant hooks for the price of one.\\" Robert Christgau considers the song to contain Heaton's \\"meanest\\" line, \\"Closer than a sister to her baby brother/Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother.\\" \\"36D\\" is a scathing attack on the British glamour industry,http://www.juicebrighton.com/on-air/artist/the-beautiful- south/bio/ described by Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic as \\"a distant relative of 'Little Baby Nothing' by the Manic Street Preachers, though far more upbeat than that song,\\" \\"features Heaton addressing a woman who's got by on looks and sex alone, telling her to 'Close your legs, open your mind' (and that's just the opening line!). The chorus packs a sonic punch you wouldn't expect from the band, as Heaton and Hemmingway ask '36D, so what? Is that all that you got?'.\\" \\"Something that You Said\\" refers to the serial murders of a lover's family (\\"So if you walk into your house and she's cutting up your mother/ She's only trying to tell you that she loves you like no other\\"). Kessler said that \\"Hemingway and Corrigan provide us with an action replay of 'A Little Time'\\" on the song, but \\"this is Paul Heaton's show, and he doesn't let anyone steal it.\\" The song's opening line, \\"The perfect love song it has no words it only has death threats/and you can tell a classic ballad by how threatening it gets,\\" compliments the \\"peaceful\\" music. Vocal duties on \\"Bell Bottomed Tear\\" are handled mainly by Briana Corrigan, though Heaton does appear at points. It has been noted that \\"the strengths of her voice is exploited very well here ‚Äì sugary, with a slight hiccup, but always fragile and vaguely damaged.\\" One reviewer said \\"her character here is never made explicitly clear ‚Äì she's a man who has got her pregnant, though whether she and the man are still together isn't made clear. Either way, he's ruined her life. Quietly devastating.\\" \\"Here it is Again\\" is a \\"brooding\\" song, whilst \\"You Play Glockenspiel, I'll Play Drums\\" is \\"odd\\". Closing song \\"When I'm 84\\" encapsulates the album's \\"dizzily wayward feel\\" and is a song of \\"innante funkiness,\\" \\"blessed with a groovy electronic piano and a bassline worth suing for. It contains Heaton's hedonistic and bold plans for retirement. 'Excerise you muscles?', he spits. 'I'd rather jack.'\\" Release 0898 Beautiful South was released on 30 March 1992 on CD, LP and cassette by the band's label Go! Discs in most regions, whilst it was released on 14 April in the United States. The album cover, which depicts ladies faces on the back of terrapins shells, each representing a different mood on the album, was painted by artist David Cutter, as are the numerous illustrations in the liner notes, each of which is based on a song from the album, with one illustration for each song. The illustrations for the album's four singles also appeared as the covers for those singles. The full title of the album is 0898 Beautiful South, but it is usually shortened to just 0898, which is how it appears on the back cover of the album.Album packaging. The spacing and typography difference on the front cover and spine can be taken to imply it should be read as \\"0898\\" (by) \\"Beautiful South\\" ‚Äì two separate phrases, although the spine of the album features both the band name and the full title separately. The title refers to the 0898 premium rate dialling code associated with sex hotlines in the UK at the time. Four singles were released from the album, two of them prior to its release. \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" was released in February 1992 and reached number 22 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their worst charting lead single so far. It reached number 51 in the German Media Control Charts. \\"We are Each Other\\" was released a month later, still prior to the release of the album, and was a lesser success in the UK, only reaching number 30. However, it provided the band with their biggest hit in the United States, where it peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single charted at number 81 in the German Media Control Charts. \\"Bell Bottomed Tear\\" was released as the third single in June 1992, reaching number 16 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the highest charting single from the album. \\"36D\\" was released as the final single in September 1992, reaching number 46 in the UK. In an interview at the time of the album's release, Sean Welch only imagined three singles would have been released, saying \\"three should be enough, I think, for anybody to release off an album.\\"YouTube footage of the band's 1992 interview with MTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot11As4leWk The album was not a success in the United States, although it gave the band a larger following there than before. Billboard magazine reported in July 1992 that \\"although it has not yet dented the Heatseekers chart,\\" the album \\"was experiencing a sales burst\\" in the United States. They said it was due to the band's \\"well-attended\\" concerts in Los Angeles and New York City and their appearance on The Dennis Miller Show. In France, a limited edition contained two bonus tracks, \\"His Time Ran Out\\" and \\"Danielle Steele (The Enemy Within)\\". A limited edition box set version released in the UK included CD and cassette copies of the album alongside the band's VHS music video compilation The Pumpkin. Reception and legacy =Initial reception= On 11 April 1992, 0898 Beautiful South entered in the UK Albums Chart at number 4, which was considered something of a disappointment after the band's previous albums both reached number 2. It stayed on the chart for 17 weeks, and was later certified \\"Gold\\" by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 200,000 copies. The album peaked at number 47 on the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming their last album to chart there, whilst on 20 April 1992, it entered the German Album Charts at number 40, becoming their first album to chart there. The album was released to positive reviews. Ted Kessler of Select gave the album a perfect five out of five score, saying \\"under a veneer of polished pop production The Beautiful South are contrary, twisted mavericks, and 0898 is the bright, acceptable face of the foul beast AOR ‚Äì and their best work to date\\". Robert Christgau rated the album \\"A‚Äì\\", saying \\"even more obscure stateside since he got lusher conventions, songsmith Paul Heaton does his endangered species proud. The tunes stick, and the lyrics transcend their sarcastic shtick‚Äîpredictably idiosyncratic though 'You do English/Ill do sums/You break fingers/Ill break thumbs' may be, it brings you up short anyway. Peter Gabriel/Kate Bush hand Jon Kelly adds musical authenticity, and third vocalist Briana Corrigan sings lines like 'This is the woman you laid' with just the right edge of icy remorse. Introduce them to a decent drum programmer and they could be a threat.\\" Q gave the album a \\"Good\\" rating of three stars out of five, saying \\"The Beautiful South offers us boozers and losers, reshaping the world and overthrowing the government from the comfort of a bar stool.\\"Q, May 1992 issue, p.71 Audio were favourable, saying \\"The Beautiful South effortlessly renders their sophisticated pop melodies and signature lyricism with silken production...wickedly clever.\\"Audio Magazine, November 1992 issue, p.122 People magazine, in its Picks and Pans section, were favourable, saying \\"minor melodramas aren't exactly the variety of glib pleasantries you'd expect such easygoing music to be delivering, but the ability to use the standard pop format to sneak in something new is the sign of a truly exceptional band. It's well worth taking a trip to the Beautiful South.\\" The album appeared in numerous lists of the best albums of 1992. Vox included the album at number 18 on their list of the \\"Vox Albums of 1992\\",Vox December 1992 issue. NME ranked it at number 44 in its list of the top 50 \\"Albums of the Year\\", Robert Christgau placed the album at number 53 on the 1992 edition of his annual \\"Dean's List\\" of the best albums of the year, curated for the annual Pazz & Jop critics' roll. A reviewer for The Pansentinent League included the album in his list of \\"My Ten Favourite Albums of the 1990s\\", saying it is \\"full of clever, funny, bittersweet lines and packed with memorable pop songs from start to finish.\\" =Legacy= The album has enjoyed a similarly favourable legacy, and some consider it to be an under-rated record. In a retrospective review, Roch Parisien of Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five, praising the band's unusual sound and Kelly's production. Colin Larkin rated the album three stars out of five in his book Encyclopedia of Popular Music. In 1998, Christgau said the album was \\"stronger than reviews caviled\\". In 2003, Maria Lamie said that the album \\"has the privilege of still being liked by its creators\\". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Keith Harris gave the album three and a half stars out of five. In 2014, a reviewer for Record Review Play said that \\"the whole album is full of hints of the sinister, as on 'Something That You Said', but compassion finds a way in (Old Red Eyes Is Back, 'Im Your Number One Fan') to provide just enough of a break from the darkness, and while theres humour, it comes in both dark and lighter shades, as on 'When Im 84'. Perhaps old age has pushed it to the back of the collection, or perhaps the unprecedented success of compilation album Carry on up the Charts, which sold record numbers in record time and seemed to find a home in music collections up and down the land, big or small, just led to Beautiful South fatigue. Regardless, 0898 is long overdue a revisit or two.\\" Corrigan chose to leave the band after the release of the album to pursue a solo career. Although her decision was partly prompted by a desire to record and promote her own material (which was not getting exposure within The Beautiful South), she had also had ethical disagreements over some of Heaton's lyrics, most notably \\"Mini-correct\\", \\"Worthless Lie\\", which he had composed for the following album Miaow (1994), but also for the 0898 Beautiful South single \\"36D\\", which criticised the British glamour industry via scathing comments about glamour models, and she thought he should have targeted the media instead. In 1997, Hemingway admitted \\"we all agree that we should have targeted the media as sexist instead of blaming the girls for taking off their tops\\". The band followed 0898 Beautiful South with Miaow (1994) which was their least successful album so far, reaching only number 6 in the UK Albums Chart and receiving mixed reviews. However, the band's fortunes were revived with the release of their first greatest hits album Carry on up the Charts later that year, which became the band's first number one album in the UK and went on to become the second biggest selling album of 1994, and by the summer of 1995 it was certified as 5x platinum in the UK. Such was the album's popularity, it was claimed that one in seven British households owned a copy. The compilation featured the four singles from 0898 Beautiful South, bringing them wider exposure than they had in 1992. \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" also featured on their second hits compilation, Solid Bronze ‚Äì Great Hits (2001), whilst the same song appeared alongside \\"36D\\" on Soup (2007), a compilation of hits by both The Beautiful South and Heaton and Hemingway's previous band The Housemartins. Track listing =French Limited Edition= The first French edition distributed by Barclay contained two bonus tracks: #\\"His Time Ran Out\\" #\\"Danielle Steele (The Enemy Within)\\" Non-LP/CD B-Sides As was their usual modus operandi, The Beautiful South included unreleased material on the B-sides of the singles taken from their albums. from the \\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" 12\\" single and CDEP *\\"Old Red Eyes Is Back\\" *\\"Fleet St. B.C.\\" *\\"Diamonds\\" (M.G.

The band was formed by David Cairns and Alan King in 1987, signing to UNI/MCA Records in the US, and MCA in the UK, and initially managed by Bill Curbishley. The early pre-production of the album was produced by Dave Cairns' former Secret Affair band-mate Dennis Smith, who also co-wrote one of the album tracks, \\"Tell It Like It Is\\" with Alan King. The album was recorded at Hook End Manor & The Virgin Manor Studios, Oxford, in the UK and produced by Walter Turbitt, engineer and producer of The Cars. It featured Steve Ferrone (drums), Keith Airey (guitar), Richard Cottle and Pete Vitesse (keyboards). The live band featured Alan King (vocals), Michael Casswell (guitar), Trevor Thornton (drums), Phil Williams (bass) & David Cairns (keyboards). Walk on Fire toured with Foreigner, The Dan Reed Network, Ratt and Nils Lofgren and toured the UK extensively, but despite favourable reviews following the US release and over 245,000 units sold worldwide, the album was not enough of a commercial success for MCA Records to keep the band and Walk On Fire were regretfully dropped over financial issues. The band went on to record material (mainly) written and produced by Dave Cairns in 24 track recording studios in and around London for a second album but with the grunge music explosion, no label was going to sign an AOR album and the band broke up. Alan King went on to sing the lead role in Jeff Wayne's follow up to 'War of The Worlds' - Spartacus - alongside Catherine Zeta-Jones and with a cast that included Anthony Hopkins and Dave Cairns went on to be appointed Special Projects and Events Manager for Gibson Guitars USA throughout the 1990s. Dave Cairns reformed Secret Affair with Ian Page in 2009 and released their fourth studio album, Soho Dreams on I-SPY Records, in September 2012. Guitarist Michael Casswell was invited by the bassist Neil Murray to join the Queen guitarist Brian May's touring band in 1991. Casswell left the band after the band's South American tour. Having performed and recorded with the UK based Japanese blues guitarist Saiichi Sugiyama (musician), whose band also featured Phil Williams on bass, Casswell subsequently formed a band with the veteran British rock drummer Cozy Powell. Casswell co-wrote and co-produced with Powell what turned out be the drummer's last album session. The album was released as Especially For You after Powell's death in a British motorway accident. Michael Casswell died in a swimming accident in September 2016. On 21 April 2017, the second album by Walk On Fire, Mind Over Matter, was released on the AOR label, Escape Music. It was written and produced by David Cairns with additional song writing by vocalist Alan King and Thom Hardwell and featuring Michael Casswell on guitar, Phil Williams on bass, Trevor Thornton on drums and Richard Cottle on keyboards.

Wright is best known for his title as the first U.S. Commissioner of Labor, serving in that capacity from 1885 to 1905. Biography Wright was born at Dunbarton, New Hampshire. He attended schools in Washington, New Hampshire, from elementary through the Tubbs Union Academy. He began to study law in 1860, but in 1862 enlisted as a private in the 14th New Hampshire Volunteer Regiment to fight the American Civil War. He became colonel in 1864, and served as assistant-adjutant general of a brigade in the Shenandoah Valley campaign under General Philip Sheridan. After the war, he was admitted to the New Hampshire bar, and in 1867 became a member of the Massachusetts and United States' bars. From 1872 to 1873 he served in the Massachusetts Senate, where he secured the passage of a bill to provide for the establishment of trains for workers to Boston from the suburban districts. From 1873 to 1878 he was chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor. In 1880, he was appointed supervisor of the U. S. Census in Massachusetts, being also special agent of the census on the factory system. In 1885 he was commissioned by the governor to investigate the public records of the towns, parishes, counties, and courts of the state.

He was the first U.S. Commissioner of Labor from 1885 to 1905, and in 1893 was placed in charge of the Eleventh Census. Wright was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1894 he was chairman of the commission which investigated the Pullman Strike of Chicago, and in 1902 was a member of the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission. He was honorary professor of social economics in the Catholic University of America from 1895 to 1904; in 1900, he became professor of statistics and social economics in Columbian University (now George Washington University). From 1900 to 1901, he was university lecturer on wage statistics at Harvard, and in 1903 he was a member of the Douglas Commission to investigate and recommend a program of vocational education for Massachusetts. In 1902, he was chosen president of Clark College (the undergraduate school at Clark University), Worcester, Massachusetts, where he was also professor of statistics and social economics from 1904 until his death. Dr. Wright was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1903, and in 1907 received the Cross of the Legion of Honor for his work in improving industrial conditions, a similar honor (Order of Saints Maurizio e Lazzaro) having been conferred upon him in 1906 by the Italian government. He was a member of the Institute of France and an honorary member of the Imperial Academy of Science of Russia. In 1907, he was elected the second president of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education. He received honorary degrees from Tufts (1883), Wesleyan (1894), Dartmouth (1897), Clark University (1902), Tufts (1902), and Amherst (1905). He died on February 20, 1909.

The boulders typically seem unworked, but some may have been worked roughly with a hammer and the gaps between boulders filled in with smaller chunks of limestone. The most famous examples of Cyclopean masonry are found in the walls of Mycenae and Tiryns, and the style is characteristic of Mycenaean fortifications. Similar styles of stonework are found in other cultures and the term has come to be used to describe typical stonework of this sort, such as the old city walls of Rajgir. The term comes from the belief of classical Greeks that only the mythical Cyclopes had the strength to move the enormous boulders that made up the walls of Mycenae and Tiryns. Pliny's Natural History reported the tradition attributed to Aristotle, that the Cyclopes were the inventors of masonry towers, giving rise to the designation \\"Cyclopean\\".Pliny, Hist. Nat.vii.56.195 : turres, ut Aristoteles, Cyclopes [invenerunt]. Current definitions A typical stretch of Cyclopean walling near Grave Circle A, Mycenae The walls are usually founded in extremely shallow beddings carved out of the bedrock. 'Cyclopean', the term normally applied to the masonry style characteristic of Mycenaean fortification systems, describes walls built of huge, unworked limestone boulders which are roughly fitted together. Between these boulders, smaller chunks of limestone fill the interstices. The exterior faces of the large boulders may be roughly hammer-dressed, but the boulders themselves are never carefully cut blocks. Very large boulders are typical of the Mycenaean walls at Mycenae, Tiryns, Argos, Krisa (in Phocis), and the Acropolis of Athens. Somewhat smaller boulders occur in the walls of Midea, whereas large limestone slabs are characteristic of the walls at Gla. Cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways, conglomerate at Mycenae and Tiryns and perhaps both conglomerate and limestone at Argos.Dartmouth.edu Prehistoric Greece site Outdated definitions of the Cyclopean style Harry Thurston Peck, writing in 1898, divided Cyclopean masonry into four categories or styles:Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, 1898. #The first style, which is the oldest, consists of unwrought stones of various sizes in which the gaps are, or were, filled with small stones. #The second is characterized by polygonal stones, which fit against each other with precision. #The third style includes structures in Phocis, Boeotia and Argolis. It is characterized by work made in courses and by stones of unequal size, but of the same height. This category includes the walls of Mycenae, the Lion Gate, and the Treasury of Atreus. Section of the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae #The fourth style is characterized by horizontal courses of masonry, not always of the same height, but of stones which are all rectangular. This style is common in Attica. While Peck's first and possibly second and third styles conform to what archaeologists today would classify as cyclopean, the fourth now is referred to as ashlar and is not considered cyclopean. There is a more detailed description of the Cyclopean styles at the Perseus Project.Cycl≈çpes at the Perseus Project Historical accounts Difference between ashlar masonry (left) and Cyclopean masonry (right), shown in the blue rectangle; Lion Gate, Mycenae, 13th century BCE Pausanias described the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns: Modern archaeologists use \\"Cyclopean\\" in a more restricted sense than the description by Pausanias; while Pausanias attributes all of the fortifications of Tiryns and Mycenae, including the Lion Gate, to the Cyclopes, only parts of these walls are built in Cyclopean masonry. The accompanying photograph shows the difference between Cyclopean masonry (shown in the blue rectangle), and the ashlar masonry of the Lion Gate. Locations of Cyclopean structures The entrance of a Mycenaean citadel in the Bronze Age, Lion Gate. It demonstrated the monumentalizing occurring in Greece and showed the power of the citadel. Apart from the Tirynthian and Mycenaean walls, other Cyclopean structures include some beehive tombs in Greece and the fortifications of a number of Mycenean sites, most famously at Gla. In Sicily there are many Cyclopean structures especially in Erice, in the western part of the island.https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/phoenician-walls-of-erice In Cyprus, the Kition archaeological site in present-day Larnaca, has revealed cyclopean walls. In the ancient city of (now Rajgir, Bihar, India), cyclopean walls can be seen. The Nuraghe of Bronze age Sardinia also are described as being constructed in cyclopean masonry, as are some of the constructions of the Talaiot culture abounding on Menorca and present to a lesser extent on Mallorca. One of the largest and least known is the \\"acropolis\\" in Alatri, an hour south of Rome. It also seems to have a portal the summer solstice sun shines and some think it is also has a number of other astronomical significant points to it.

The phrase was taken out of context and picked up and soon went viral, being widely quoted and printed across the country. It continues to be seen on greeting cards, T-shirts, mugs, plaques, and bumper stickers. She recounted how her now-famous quote has taken on a life of its own in an October 2007 interview: \\"It was a weird escape into popular culture. I got constant e-mails about it, and I thought it was humorous. Then I started looking at where it was coming from.

It seemed like a teaching moment‚Äîand so I wrote a book using the title.\\" Well-Behaved Women examines the ways in which women shaped history, citing examples from the lives of Rosa Parks, Christine de Pizan, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Tubman, and Virginia Woolf. =A Midwife's Tale= A Midwife's Tale A Midwife's Tale examines the life of Northern New England midwife Martha Ballard, and provides a vivid examination of ordinary life in the early American republic, including the role of women in the household and local market economy, the nature of marriage and sexual relations, aspects of medical practice, and the prevalence of violence and crime. In this book, Ulrich effectively and simultaneously builds historical knowledge of the colonial world and Martha Ballard's biography. Ulrich's revelatory history was honored with the Pulitzer Prize. A Midwife's Tale also received the Bancroft Prize (prompting a speech by Ulrich which compares her own diary and life to Ballard's), the John H. Dunning Prize, the Joan Kelly Memorial Prize, the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians Book Prize, the Society for Historians of the Early Republic Book Prize, the William Henry Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine, and the New England Historical Association Award. A Midwife's Tale was later developed into a docudrama film for the PBS series American Experience by producer Laurie Kahn- Levitt and director Richard P. Rogers. The film was based upon both Ulrich‚Äôs book and her archival process, and Ulrich served as a consultant, script collaborator, and narrator. The book also helped her secure a \\"Genius Grant\\" from the MacArthur Fellows Program. The book became a landmark in women's labor history since it provides scholars with rich insights into the life of a lay American rural healer around 1800. It rests not on the observations of outsiders, but on the words of the woman herself. At first glance, Ballard's encoded, repetitive, and quotidian diary often appears trivial, but as Ulrich found, \\"it is in the very dailiness, the exhaustive, repetitious dailiness, that the real power of Martha Ballard's book lies... For her, living was to be measured in doing.\\" By knitting together \\"ordinary\\" sources to produce a meaningful, extraordinary socio-cultural narrative, Ulrich shows how a skilled practitioner functioned within the interstices of the private and public spheres. The book, divided into 10 sections, takes the \\"dailiness\\" of Ballard's diary and transforms it into a rich historical source. *Section 1 The first entry in A Midwife's Tale puts midwifery in a broader medical context within the Kennebec region, beginning to put Ballard's diary in context of other primary sources at the time. This chapter establishes the relationship between doctors and midwives during this time period. Ulrich also introduces the concept of ‚Äúsocial medicine‚Äù in this chapter, referring to the sharing of information among midwives and doctors. This is evident in midwife manuals that Ulrich cites. *Section 2 This section shows the separate economy among women in Hallowell. Ulrich describes this economy as facilitated by the 'social webs' of production and consumption. *Section 3 This entry follows an important rape trial in Hallowell. Mrs. Foster accused Judge North of raping her while her husband was away. Historians are able to contrast Martha‚Äôs account of the trial with Henry Sewall‚Äôs account. Henry Sewall opposed the Foster‚Äôs religious beliefs whereas Martha Ballard felt sympathetic toward the Fosters because other‚Äôs judged them for their religious beliefs. *Section 4 This section is concerned with the three Ballard family marriages which occurred in 1792, in which Ulrich explores the understanding of marriage and sex at this time. The mid-eighteenth century is seen as a turning point in history when children began only then to choose their own partners and Ballard‚Äôs diary entries support this. It seems as though all the Ballard marriages in 1792 were courtships chosen by the children as opposed to arrangements proposed for economic benefits. Additionally, there is pre- marital sex. *Section 5 This chapter details the fifty-three deliveries Ballard performed in 1793. Ulrich emphasizes that an average of one baby a week seems easy, but Martha often sat for weeks doing nothing, and for others, facing multiple births in a short time during poor weather. *Section 6 1796, the focus of section 6, is a physically taxing year for her and her husband. She is traveling to deliver babies in flea-infested cabins while her husband works in swamps swarming with mosquitos. Their children also have some health issues that year. In November, her husband Ephraim is at muskie-point and all of his instruments were stolen at the outset of a planned extended surveying journey - canceling the trip, he returned five days later. On the same day, consequently (or around the same time), Martha delivered her 600th baby, a milestone. Ephraim‚Äôs work continues to be difficult. Martha prays for strength to continue faring through her difficult and laborious life. *Section 7 This section follows the death and autopsy of John Davis, the son of John Vassall Davis in Kennebec. Ulrich fleshes out the significance of Martha Ballard‚Äôs presence at the autopsy. Ulrich discusses the change later in 1820, a Harvard Medical School professor published a treatise stating that women should no longer be midwives as they are not educated enough to practice medicine. *Section 8 This chapter tracks Martha‚Äôs entries while her husband, Ephraim Ballard, is in jail for debt. During this time, Martha‚Äôs son, Jonathan, takes over Martha and Ephraim‚Äôs house. These entries highlight Martha and Jonathan's rocky relationship. Additionally, Martha experiences a pseudo-widowhood during this time, acknowledging Ephraim‚Äôs role in the household that now must be filled by her son. This entry gives important information regarding jail time in Kennebec, as Ephraim is allowed to continue working during the day and only has to sleep at the jail at night. There is flexibility regarding cases of debt. *Section 9 This section is centered around a mass murder that occurred in Hallowell. James Purrinton, one of Martha‚Äôs neighbors, murdered his wife and all of his children but one, who escaped. Martha‚Äôs entry adds another viewpoint on this historic event. Ulrich writes, ‚ÄúThe economy of Martha‚Äôs telling contrasts with the more self-conscious narrative published (and probably composed) by Peter Edes, editor of Augusta‚Äôs Kennebec Gazette.‚Äù *Section 10 Ulrich discusses the importance of women in field agriculture, as characterized by Martha‚Äôs garden and her records of the flowers and vegetables she planted in her time. As Martha grows older, her diary recounts fewer births. Ulrich hypothesizes that this decrease in births is due to another midwife taking over Ballard‚Äôs work. A Midwife's Tale was not only methodologically influential for scholars, but also theoretically important. By showing clearly the economic contributions that midwives made to their households and local communities, and demonstrating the organizational skill of multitasking as a source of female empowerment, the book revises the understanding of prescribed gender roles. While A Midwife's Tale is obviously limited in terms of time (1785‚Äì1812) and place (rural Maine), it has attracted sustained attention of historians‚Äîespecially those interested in gender relations and wage-earning, the economic value of domestic labor, and women's work before industrialization. Ulrich invokes these contributions to historical knowledge in a 2009 interview, stating, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anonymous people need to be included in the historical record just because of fairness or justice. Studying them more carefully makes for more accurate history,‚Äù highlighting the potential for work like hers on historically non-dominant voices. The book has also been taught as an exemplar of archival and historical work and explored in conjunction with Ulrich's own life as a historian, writer, and activist. = Other work= In January 2017, Ulrich's book A House Full of Females: Plural Marriage and Women's Rights in Early Mormonism, was released. This text explores Mormon women living in Utah during the 19th century who had entered into plural marriages. Ulrich argues that this system was both complicated and empowering for the women in these relationships. Personal life While she was an undergraduate student, she married Gael Ulrich, now emeritus professor of chemical engineering at the University of New Hampshire. Together they had five children: Karl (b. 1960), Melinda (b. 1963), Nathan (b. 1964), Thatcher (b. 1969), and Amy (b. 1975). =Religion= Ulrich self-identifies as an active feminist and Latter-day Saint (Mormon), and has written about her experiences. She also co-edited (with Emma Lou Thayne) All God's Critters Got a Place in the Choir, a collection of essays about the lives of Mormon women. Ulrich was a co-founder, with Claudia Bushman, Judy Dushku, Sue Paxman and others, of Exponent II, an independent publication on the experience of Latter-day Saint women. In late 1992, Brigham Young University's board of trustees vetoed without comment a BYU proposal to invite Ulrich to address the annual BYU Women's Conference. Ulrich did give addresses at BYU in 2004 and 2006. At Harvard, Ulrich is actively involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; she is the adviser for the undergraduate Latter-day Saint Student Association and the Latter-day Saint campus club, and teaches an Institute of Religion class.

Synopsis The film centres on the experiences of Robert Lawrence MC (played by Colin Firth), an officer of the Scots Guards during the Falklands War of 1982. While fighting at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown, Lawrence is shot in the head by an Argentine sniper, and left paralysed on his left side. He then must learn to adjust to his new disability.

The film also triggered controversy by presenting an unvarnished portrait of the protagonist: for example, his joy in the brutalities of war and a stunning flashback scene toward the end which shows him exulting at the top of Mount Tumbledown. The film portrays Lawrence's love of the military life as much as it portrays his feelings of abandonment and bitterness as he tries to cope with his wounds, with little help from the government that sent him into battle. Lead actor Colin Firth is reported to have said that the political left and right hated the film because it did not conform to any fixed ideology.

They are also founders of the Grand Central Records label. History In 1995 Mark Rae fulfilled a long-term dream by founding Grand Central Records in Manchester. He first met sound engineer and producer Steve Christian when they both utilised the same rehearsal space in Ducie House in the Northern Quarter of Manchester. The first meeting took place when Christian, who is the production strength of the duo, walked past Rae's studio and informed him that his music was out of key. The pair embarked on a partnership that has seen them achieve critical and public acclaim for their work In an interview with Pride Of Manchester, Rae said: Naturally, this new act was the first to release records on the Grand Central Records label. Their first release was an EP, Pure Arithmetic, released in June 1995 under the band name First Priority. A year after their emergence, Rae and Christian enlisted the vocal skills of Veba to add a more diverse flavour to their sound. Contributions to the Grand Central Records compilations Frying The Fat and Central Heating attracted attention from the dance music press. In 1998, they released their debut album as Rae & Christian, Northern Sulphuric Soul. The Jungle Brothers and Jeru The Damaja both contributed to the album's songs, giving them an edge over other sampling groups of the late 1990s. They undertook a heavy touring schedule, travelling with their own percussionist, double bass player, female vocalist, scratch DJ, saxophone, flute and rhodes players, to complement the skills of Rae behind the deck and Christian on guitar. At the same time as nurturing other acts on the Grand Central Records label, their production and remixes were utilised by (Lamb, The Pharcyde, Wai Wan) and mainstream stars such as Natalie Imbruglia, Simply Red and The Manic Street Preachers. Their second album, Sleepwalking marked a change in approach, a movement towards more live instrumentation and more varied songwriting partnerships with veteran musicians such as Bobby Womack, Tania Maria and The Congos. Mark and Steve released their third album in October 2013 and took the new album on the road with varied line ups to match availability with the vocal guests involved. The album was recorded over the previous four years in Yorkshire in Steve Christian's studio with additional recording and writing under taken in Mark Rae's London studio. The album features the following guests: Ed Harcourt, Kate Rogers, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Masta Ace, Mystro, Jake Emlyn, Gita Langley, Diagrams, Mark Foster, Agent 86, Mel Uye Parker and Pete Simpson.

It was manufactured by Nippon Kogaku K. K. (today Nikon Corporation) in Japan from 1979 to 1982 (available new from dealer stock until circa 1984). The camera was designed for and marketed to the growing market of new women photographers then entering the SLR buyer's market.Nikon  Corporate Information  About Nikon  History  Nikon Family Cousins  Part 11 : \\"Nikon EM\\" The EM uses a Seiko MFC-E focal plane shutter with a speed range of 1 to 1/1000 second plus Bulb and flash X-sync of 1/90 second. It is high, wide, deep and weighed . Unlike most Nikons of the time, it was available only in black. The EM has no full manual exposure mode capability, but instead was intended to be used by inexperienced photographers who could not easily master the intricacies of shutter speeds and f-stops. There were also significant changes to the EM's mechanical and electrical components to reduce its production cost relative to previous Nikon cameras: dimensional tolerances weren't as tight, there were no ball bearings in the film advance mechanism, and no high-quality titanium shutter. The introductory US list price for the body plus normal lens was only $231. The EM accepts nearly all lenses with the Nikon F bayonet mount introduced in 1959, and supports the automatic indexing (AI) feature introduced in 1977. The contemporary Nikon-made AI lenses were the Nikkor AI-S, Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E types. The AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. Nikon's most recent 35 mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type introduced in 2000, lack an aperture control ring, and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's digital SLRs will mount but will not function properly. IX Nikkor lenses introduced in 1996 for Nikon's Advanced Photo System SLRs must not be mounted to an EM, as their rear elements will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage.  Design History  Beginning in 1977 with the advanced amateur Nikon FM, there was a complete overhaul of the entire Nikon SLR line. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of intense competition among major SLR brands Nikon, Canon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. Between 1975 and 1985 there was a shift away from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with housings made of lighter materials and electronic automation controlled by integrated circuits. Because of rapid advances in electronics, the brands continually leapfrogged each other with models having new or more automatic features. The industry was trying to expand out from the saturated high-end professional market and appeal to the large mass of amateur photographers who wanted to move up from compact automatic leaf-shutter rangefinder cameras to an SLR, but were intimidated by the need to learn the details of operating a traditional SLR. Although Nikon cameras like the F2 of 1971 were highly regarded by professional photographers, the F2's bulk, expense, and intricacy made it a slow seller to most amateurs and beginners.Stafford, Simon, et al., The New Nikon Compendium New York:Lark Books (2003) Although Nikon's mid-level Nikkormat FT (1965) and EL (1972) camera series were made almost as well as the Nikon F and F2, their relatively high price turned amateurs toward less expensive models from other manufacturers. Nikon EM & nikkor 50mm ∆í/2  Features  The Nikon EM formed the base of the new line. On introduction it was the smallest and cheapest Nikon SLR ever made. It was an electromechanically-controlled, manual-focus camera powered by button batteries. The EM featured a lightweight, compact copper-aluminum alloy body and fiberglass-reinforced polycarbonate plastic top and bottom covers, plus aperture priority semiautomatic exposure control governed by a built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, silicon photodiode light meter. A left side viewfinder galvanometer needle pointer indicated the exposure on a shutter speed scale. The viewfinder also had Nikon's standard 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids, but the focus screen was fixed. The viewfinder is dimmer than those in the semi-professional Nikons since the expensive prisms of the latter were not used. The camera is also fitted with a low-light exposure warning in the form of an audible 'beep'. Accessories for the EM included a highly automated dedicated electronic flash unit, the Nikon SB-E (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and a very small power winder, the Nikon MD-E (motorized film advance at 2 frames per second). There was also a new Nikon Series E range of lenses. The Series E lens line up in 1980 included a 28 mm ∆í/2.8 wide angle, a 35 mm ∆í/2.5 semi-wide angle, a 50 mm ∆í/1.8 normal, a 100 mm ∆í/2.8 short telephoto and a 75‚Äì150 mm ∆í/3.5 zoom, with the subsequent addition of a 70‚Äì210 mm ∆í/4 zoom, and a 135 mm ∆í/2.8 medium telephoto. These lenses were intended to enhance the EM's appeal to new users, as inexpensive but good quality alternatives to expensive Nikkor-branded lenses. The EM also had one very rare feature for an electronically controlled camera. Nippon Kogaku's philosophy that a camera must always work when called upon resulted in the EM's backup ability to operate without batteries, albeit in a limited fashion: mechanical control with one available fixed shutter speed (1/90 second, marked \\"M90\\") or fully-manual, operator-controlled open- shutter duration marked \\"B\\" for \\"Bulb\\", and without the light meter. A little- known feature of the EM is that when the battery is removed, the \\"Auto\\" setting produces a shutter speed of approximately 1/1000 sec. This is documented in the factory repair manual. The EM and its E-system accessories were Nippon Kogaku's first attempt to reach the low end of the SLR market. Called internally ‚ÄúSLR Camera for Women‚Äù, the EM was designed to provide style, with its exterior contours designed Italian automobile stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro); convenience with a system of dedicated accessories; as much ease of use and automation as was possible in 1979; low cost by dint of a simplified manufacturing process, and the prestige of the Nikon name prominently displayed on the pentaprism housing. The Nikon EM and its later offshoots the FG and FG-20 were a sales and marketing failure for Nikon. Traditional Nikon owners shunned their cheap construction and lack of manual exposure control. The expected female beginner photographer market also failed to appear, as these photographers rejected the implicit condescension of an aperture-priority-only EM, and instead bought either higher-priced Nikons or other-brand cameras. The less-expensive Series E lenses marketed with the camera also came in for heavy criticism, and Nikon soon dropped the entire line. Despite its cheaper construction quality, the EM has proved to be as reliable over the years as more expensive Nikons of the era.B. Moose Peterson Nikon System Handbook 5th Ed. Although the Series E lenses were unpopular with Nikon buyers, several of the Series E lenses exhibited excellent performance, particularly the 50 mm ∆í/1.8, the 100 mm ∆í/2.8, and the 75‚Äì150 mm ∆í/3.5 zoom.

A thioamide (rarely, thionamide, but also known as thiourylenes) is a functional group with the general structure R‚ÄìCS‚ÄìNR‚Ä≤R‚Ä≥, where R, R‚Ä≤, and R‚Ä≥ are organic groups. They are analogous to amides but they exhibit greater multiple bond character along the C-N bond, resulting in a larger rotational barrier. One of the best-known thioamides is thioacetamide, which is used as a source of the sulfide ion and is a building block in heterocyclic chemistry. Thioamides or anti-thyroid drugs are also a class of drugs that are used to control thyrotoxicosis. Preparation and structure Thioamides are typically prepared by treating amides with phosphorus sulfides such as phosphorus pentasulfide and, in more specialized applications, Lawesson's reagent. An alternative route entails the reaction of nitriles with hydrogen sulfide: Thionamide Synthesis The Willgerodt-Kindler reaction also affords benzylthioamides. The C2NH2S core of thioamides is planar. Using thioacetamide as representative: the C-S, C-N, and C-C distances are 1.68, 1.31, and 1.50 √Ö, respectively. The short C-S and C-N distances indicate multiple bonding.  Thioamides in biochemistry and medicine Thioamides are also a class of drugs that are used to control thyrotoxicosis. Thioamides have been incorporated into peptides as isosteres for the amide bond. Peptide modifications are analogues of the native peptide, which can reveal the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Analogues of peptides can also be used as drugs with an improved oral bioavailability. Thioamides inhibit the enzyme thyroid peroxidase in the thyroid, reducing the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), thereby blocking uptake of iodotyrosines from the colloid. They also block iodine release from peripheral hormone. Maximum effects occur only after a month, since hormone depletion is caused by reduced synthesis, which is a slow process. Because thioamides can penetrate the placental barrier, caution is advised when used during pregnancy. Ten percent of patients report skin eruptions (such as macules and papules), urticaria, dermatitis, fever, and arthralgia; 0.03% of all patients develop agranulocytosis. Members of the thioamide group include methimazole, carbimazole (converted in vivo to methimazole), and propylthiouracil.

Portrait by Mathew Brady, New York City, undated (Library of Congress) (William) Vincent Wallace (11 March 181212 October 1865) was an Irish composer and musician. In his day, he was famous on three continents as a double virtuoso on violin and piano. Nowadays, he is mainly remembered as an opera composer of note, with key works such as Maritana (1845) and Lurline (1847/60), but he also wrote a large amount of piano music (including some virtuoso pieces) that was much in vogue in the 19th century. His more modest output of songs and ballads, equally wide-ranging in style and difficulty, was also popular in his day, some numbers being associated with famous singers of the time. Early life Blue plaque in Waterford Wallace was born at Colbeck Street, Waterford, Ireland. Both of his parents were Irish; his father, Spencer Wallace of County Mayo, one of four children, who was born in Killala, County Mayo in 1789, became a regimental bandmaster with the North Mayo Militia based in Ballina. William was born while the regiment was stationed for one year in Waterford, one of several successive postings in Ireland and the UK. The family returned to Ballina some four years later, in 1816, and William spent his formative years there, taking an active part in his father's band and already composing pieces by the age of nine for the band recitals. The band, having a reputation for high standards, apart from regimental duties would have featured at social events in big houses in the area. Under the tuition of his father and uncle, he wrote pieces for the bands and orchestras of his native area. Wallace became accomplished in playing various band instruments before the family left the Army in 1826 (their regiment then being the 29th Foot), moving from Waterford to Dublin, and becoming active in music in the capital. Wallace learned to play several instruments as a boy, including the violin, clarinet, organ, and piano. In 1830, at the age of 18, he became organist of the Roman Catholic Cathedral at Thurles, County Tipperary, and taught music at the Ursuline Convent there. He fell in love with a pupil, Isabella Kelly, whose father consented to their marriage in 1832 on condition that Wallace become a Roman Catholic. The couple soon moved to Dublin, where Wallace was employed as a violinist at the Theatre Royal. Career and travels A bust of Wallace by Seamus Murphy can be seen outside Waterford's Theatre Royal Economic conditions in Dublin having deteriorated after the Act of Union of 1800, the whole Wallace family decided to emigrate to Australia in 1835. Wallace, together with his wife Isabella and young son, Willy, travelled as free emigrants from Liverpool in July. His father, with his second wife Matilda and one child, travelled with the rest of the family, Elizabeth, a soprano, and Wellington, a flautist, as bounty emigrants from Cork that autumn. The composer's party first landed at Hobart, Tasmania in late October, where they stayed several months, and then moved on to Sydney in January 1836, where, following the arrival of the rest of the family in February, the Wallaces opened the first Australian music academy in April. Wallace had already given many celebrity concerts in Sydney, and, being the first virtuoso to visit the Colony, became known as the \\"Australian Paganini\\". His sister Elizabeth, at age 19, in 1839 married an Australian singer John Bushelle, with whom she gave many recitals before his early death in 1843 on a tour of van Diemen's Land. Wallace was also active in the business of importing pianos from London, but his main activity involved many recitals in and around Sydney under the patronage of the Governor, General Sir Richard Bourke. The most significant musical events of this period were two large oratorio concerts at St. Mary's (Roman Catholic) Cathedral in Sydney in 1836 and 1838, on behalf of the organ fund, which were directed by Wallace, and which utilized all the available musical talent of the Colony, including the recently formed Philharmonic [Choral] Society. In 1838, he separated from his wife, and began a roving career that took him around the globe. Wallace claimed that from Australia he went to New Zealand on a whaling-voyage in the South seas and while there encountered the Maori tribe Te Aupouri, and having crossed the Pacific, he visited Chile, Argentina, Peru, Jamaica, and Cuba, giving concerts in the large cities of those countries. In 1841, he conducted a season of Italian opera in Mexico City. Moving on to the United States, he stayed at New Orleans for some years, where he was feted as a virtuoso on violin and piano, before reaching New York, where he was equally celebrated, and published his first compositions (1843‚Äì44). Scene from Maritana (1845): The wedding of Don C√¶sar and Maritana He arrived in London in 1845 and made various appearances as a pianist. In November of that year, his opera Maritana was performed at Drury Lane with great success, and was later presented internationally, including Dublin (1846), Vienna, Austria (1848), and in Australia.Information about Maritana Wallace's sister, Elisabeth, appeared at Covent Garden in the title role in 1848. Maritana was followed by Matilda of Hungary (1847), Lurline (1847/60),Information about Lurline The Amber Witch (1861), Love's Triumph (1862) and The Desert Flower (1863) (based on the libretto of Hal√©vy's Jaguarita l'Indienne). He also published numerous compositions for the piano. Vincent Wallace was a cultivated man and an accomplished musician, whose work as an operatic composer, at a period by no means encouraging to music in England, has a distinct historical value. Like Michael William Balfe, he was born an Irishman, and his reputation as one of the few composers known beyond the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland at that time is naturally coupled with Balfe's. Later life Wallace's grave at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, in 2014; visible behind it is Balfe's grave In 1854, Wallace became an American citizen after a (most likely common-law) marriage in New York with the German-born pianist H√©l√®ne Stoepel, sister of composer Robert Stoepel. In New York, in 1843‚Äì44, he had been associated with the early concert seasons of the New York Philharmonic Society, and in 1853 was elected an Honorary (Life) Member of the Society. In later years, having returned to Europe for the premieres of his later operas, he developed a heart condition, for which he received treatment in Paris in 1864. He died in poor circumstances at the Ch√¢teau de Bagen, Sauveterre de Comminges, in the Haute Garonne (the home of H√©l√®ne's sister, Marie-Therese, Baroness de Saintegeme), on 12 October 1865, leaving two widows, a son, Willy, from his first marriage who died in 1909, and two sons by H√©l√®ne, Clarence Sutherland and Vincent St. John, the latter of whom, faced with a terminal condition in the French hospital in San Francisco in 1897, committed suicide.

More than 20,000 people were killed. The Armero tragedy ( ) was one of the major consequences of the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz stratovolcano in Tolima, Colombia, on November 13, 1985. After 69 years of dormancy, the volcano's eruption caught nearby towns unaware, even though the government had received warnings from multiple volcanological organizations to evacuate the area after the detection of volcanic activity two months earlier. As pyroclastic flows erupted from the volcano's crater, they melted the mountain's glaciers, sending four enormous lahars (volcanically induced mudflows, landslides, and debris flows) down its slopes at . The lahars picked up speed in gullies and engulfed the town of Armero, killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants.Schuster, Robert L. and Highland, Lynn M. (2001). Socioeconomic and Environmental Impacts of Landslides in the Western Hemisphere, U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 01-0276. Also previously published in the Proceedings of the Third Panamerican Symposium on Landslides, July 29 to August 3, 2001, Cartagena, Colombia. Castaneda Martinez, Jorge E., and Olarte Montero, Juan, eds. Retrieved June 11, 2010. Casualties in other towns, particularly Chinchin√°, brought the overall death toll to 23,000. Footage and photographs of Omayra S√°nchez, a young victim of the tragedy, were published around the world. Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster. A banner at a mass funeral in Ibagu√© read, \\"The volcano didn't kill 22,000 people. The government killed them.\\" The relief efforts were hindered by the composition of the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel√©e, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and days leading up to the eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds of the eruption until it was too late. Nevado del Ruiz has erupted several times since the disaster, and continues to threaten up to 500,000 people living along the Combeima, Chinchin√°, Coello-Toche, and Guali river valleys. A lahar (or group of lahars) similar in size to the 1985 event might travel as far as from the volcano, and could be triggered by a small eruption. To counter this threat, the Colombian government established a specialized office which promotes awareness of natural threats. The United States Geological Survey also created the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program and the Volcano Crisis Assistance Team, which evacuated roughly 75,000 people from the area around Mount Pinatubo before its 1991 eruption. In 1988, three years after the eruption, Dr. Stanley Williams of Louisiana State University stated that, \\"With the possible exception of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately\\" as Nevado del Ruiz. Many of Colombia's cities have programs to raise awareness of natural disaster planning programs which have helped save lives in natural disasters. Near Nevado del Ruiz in particular, locals have become wary of volcanic activity: when the volcano erupted in 1989, more than 2,300 people living around it were evacuated. Background Armero, located from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano and from Colombia's capital of Bogot√°, was the third largest town in Tolima Department, after Ibagu√© and Espinal. A prominent farming town before the eruption, it was responsible for roughly one-fifth of Colombia's rice production, and for a large share of the cotton, sorghum, and coffee crops. Much of this success can be attributed to Nevado del Ruiz, as the fertile volcanic soil had stimulated agricultural growth. Built on top of an alluvial fan that had been host to historic lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptionsMileti et al., 1991, p. 9. produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636 people. During the 1845 event, 1,000 people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.Mileti et al., 1991, p. 10. Nevado del Ruiz has undergone three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8 million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000 years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200 BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras. One week before the eruption, the Palace of Justice siege took place. The assailants (M-19 a Marxist, Terrorist Insurgency group) planned to hold a trial involving Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He refused to participate and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). This disaster, coupled with the Armero tragedy, spurred the Colombian government to predict and prepare for a broad range of threats. 1985 activity =Precursor= Nevado del Ruiz seen from space. The summit ice cap and glaciers surround the dark Arenas crater. In late 1984, geologists noticed that seismic activity in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice. An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and found them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them. Volcanic activity increased again in November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur began to appear in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma. The thermodynamic equilibration temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, ranged from ; this is a measure of the temperature at which the gases equilibrated within the volcano. The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano in the space above the magma, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption. =Preparation and attempted evacuation= A recent hazard map prepared for Nevado del Ruiz and vicinity, showing all of the major disaster zones affected by the eruption In September 1985, as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation. In October, a hazard map was finalized for the area around Nevado del Ruiz. This map highlighted the danger from falling material‚Äîincluding ash and rock‚Äînear Murillo, Santa Isabel, and Libano, as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita, Guayabal, Chinchin√° and Armero. The map was poorly distributed to the people at high risk from Ruiz: many survivors had never heard of it, even though several of the country's major newspapers featured versions of the map.Villegas, p. 5. Henry Villegas of INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) stated that the hazard maps clearly demonstrated that Armero would be affected by the lahars, but that the map \\"met with strong opposition from economic interests.\\" He added that because the map was not prepared long before the eruption, mass production and distribution of it in time was difficult.Villegas, p. 6. At least one of the hazard maps published in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogot√° included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area). Another map published by the El Tiempo newspaper featured illustrations which \\"gave a perception of topography to the public unfamiliar with maps, allowing them to relate hazard zones to the landscape.\\" In spite of this presentation that was keyed to the audience, the map ended up a more artistic representation of the risk than a purely scientific one. The day of the eruption, black ash columns erupted from the volcano at approximately 3:00 pm local time. The local Civil Defense director was promptly alerted to the situation. He contacted INGEOMINAS, which ruled that the area should be evacuated; he was then told to contact the Civil Defense directors in Bogot√° and Tolima. Between 5:00 and 7:00 pm, the ash stopped falling, and local officials, including the town priest Augusto Osorio,http://sci.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Nevado.html instructed people to \\"stay calm\\" and go inside. Around 5:00 pm an emergency committee meeting was called, and when it ended at 7:00 pm, several members contacted the regional Red Cross over the intended evacuation efforts at Armero, Mariquita, and Honda. The Ibagu√© Red Cross contacted Armero's officials and ordered an evacuation, which was not carried out because of electrical problems caused by a storm. The storm's heavy rain and constant thunder may have overpowered the noise of the volcano, and with no systematic warning efforts, the residents of Armero were completely unaware of the continuing activity at Ruiz. At 9:45 pm, after the volcano had erupted, Civil Defense officials from Ibagu√© and Murillo tried to warn Armero's officials, but could not make contact. Later they overheard conversations between individual officials of Armero and others; famously, a few heard the Mayor of Armero speaking on a ham radio, saying \\"that he did not think there was much danger\\", when he was overtaken by the lahar.Mileti et. al, pp. 58‚Äì64. =Eruption= The summit of Nevado del Ruiz in late November 1985 At 9:09 p.m., on November 13, 1985,Mileti et al., p. 13. Nevado del Ruiz ejected dacitic tephra more than into the atmosphere. The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million metric tons, only three percent of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980. The eruption reached 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 metric tons, or about two percent of the mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption unusually sulfur rich. The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a small lake that was observed in Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow. The lahars, formed of water, ice, pumice, and other rocks, incorporated clay from eroding soil as they traveled down the volcano's flanks. They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of , dislodging rock and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars followed the six river valleys leading from the volcano, where they grew to almost four times their original volume. In the Gual√≠ River, a lahar reached a maximum width of . Survivors in Armero described the night as \\"quiet\\". Volcanic ash had been falling throughout the day, but residents were informed it was nothing to worry about. Later in the afternoon, ash began falling again after a long period of quiet. Local radio stations reported that residents should remain calm and ignore the material. One survivor reported going to the fire department to be informed that the ash was \\"nothing\\". During the night, the electrical power suddenly turned off and the radios went silent. Just before 11:30 p.m., a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they believed to be a flood.Mart√≠ and Ernst, p. 290. Armero after the eruption, December 1985 At 11:30 p.m., the first lahar hit, followed shortly by the others. One of the lahars virtually erased Armero; three-quarters of its 28,700 inhabitants were killed. Proceeding in three major waves, this lahar was deep, moved at , and lasted ten to twenty minutes. Traveling at about , the second lahar lasted thirty minutes and was followed by smaller pulses. A third major pulse brought the lahar's duration to roughly two hours. By that point, 85 percent of Armero was enveloped in mud. Survivors described people holding on to debris from their homes in attempts to stay above the mud. Buildings collapsed, crushing people and raining down debris. The front of the lahar contained boulders and cobbles that would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts ‚Äî the eyes, ears, and mouth ‚Äî and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia in one or two minutes upon people buried in it. Mart√≠ and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia, though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.Mart√≠ and Ernst, p. 291. Another lahar, which descended through the valley of the Chinchin√° River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed 400 homes in Chinchin√°.Mileti et al., p. 1. In total, more than 23,000 people were killed, approximately 5,000 were injured, and 5,000 homes throughout thirteen villages were destroyed. Some 230,000 people were affected, were disrupted, and there were nearly 20,000 survivor-refugees. The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel√©e, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption recorded since 1500 AD. It is also the deadliest lahar, and Colombia's worst natural disaster. =Impact= Armero was located in the center of this photograph, taken in late November 1985. The loss of life was exacerbated by the lack of an accurate timeframe for the eruption and the unwillingness of local authorities to take costly preventative measures without clear signs of imminent danger. Because its last substantial eruption had occurred 140 years earlier, in 1845, it was difficult for many to accept the danger presented by the volcano; locals even called it the \\"Sleeping Lion.\\" Hazard maps showing that Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering.Mileti et al., p. 53. The eruption occurred at the height of guerrilla warfare in Bogot√°, Colombia's capital, and so the government and army were preoccupied at the time of the eruption. Only a few buildings and structures remained standing after the mud and debris flows ravaged the town of Armero. The day after the eruption, relief workers were appalled at its impact. The lahars had left behind a gray mass which covered the entire town. Armero was dotted with broken trees and horribly disfigured human bodies. Debris from huts and homes protruded from beneath the gray mud. A few bags filled with crops were discovered in the mud. Workers described an acrid smell of \\"rotting bodies, [...] wood smoke and decaying vegetables.\\" To the horror of these workers, who were scrambling to begin relief efforts, survivors let out moans of pain and agony. The damages were assessed at six billion dollars, an amount approximately one-fifth of Colombia's 1985 Gross National Product. As news of the catastrophe spread around the world, the ongoing Colombian presidential election stopped, and the guerrilla fighters stopped their campaign \\"in view of the painful tragedy that has befallen our [the Colombian fighters] nation.\\" Tickets for Colombian national championship soccer games added a surcharge of five cents to go to relief efforts. Scientists who later analyzed the seismograph data noticed that several long-period earthquakes (which begin strongly and then slowly die out) had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, \\"the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'\\", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read the signal. Relief efforts The eruption occurred two months after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, limiting the amount of supplies that could be sent to each of the disasters. Efforts were organized in Ibagu√© and Bogot√° for Armero and in Cali for Chinchina, where medical teams gathered. Makeshift triage stations were established in Lerida, Guayabal, and Mariquita, and soon were overwhelmed with the sheer number of victims. The remaining victims were directed to Ibagu√©'s hospitals, as local institutions had already been destroyed or were at risk from further lahars. The Armero tragedy occurred just after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, responsible for the destruction of buildings such as this one. The US government spent over $1 million in aid (equivalent to $ million today), and US Ambassador to Colombia Charles S. Gillespie, Jr. donated an initial $25,000 to Colombian disaster assistance institutions ($ today). The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the US Agency for International Development (AID) sent one member of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), along with an AID disaster-relief expert and 12 helicopters with support and medical personnel from Panama. The US subsequently sent additional aircraft and supplies, including 500 tents, 2,250 blankets, and several tent repair kits. Twenty-four other nations contributed to the rescue and assistance of survivors. Ecuador supplied a mobile hospital, and Iceland's Red Cross sent $4,650 ($ today). The French government sent their own medical supplies with 1,300 tents. Japan sent $1.25 million ($ million today), along with eight doctors, nurses, and engineers, plus $50,000 ($ today) to the United Nations for relief efforts. Another $50,000 ($ today) was donated by the Lions Clubs International Foundation. Rescue efforts were hindered by the soft mud that was up to deep in some places, making it virtually impossible for anyone to traverse it without sinking in. To make the situation worse, the highway connected to Armero and several bridges to it had been demolished by the lahars. It took twelve hours for the first survivors to be rescued, so those with serious but treatable injuries probably died before the rescuers arrived. Because Armero's hospital was destroyed in the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came from all over the country.Desjarlais and Eisenberg, p. 30. Of the 1,244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these people could have been saved. On November 20, 1985, one week later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000 relief workers and rescue team members were still searching for survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the official death toll was registered at 22,540 people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000 homeless, and 4,000 injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, their job was over. The eruption was used as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries. The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' psychological trauma was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues. Rafael Ruiz, an Army Major who briefly served as Armero's provisional mayor after the disaster, stated that there were survivors who, due to the trauma of the event, were \\"jittery\\", experienced \\"nightmares\\", and suffered from \\"emotional problems.\\" He added that the progress made by Christmas of 1985 was considerable, but that there was \\"still a long way to go.\\" Aftermath Nevado del Ruiz roughly two weeks after the eruption took place A lack of preparation for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking that they might be buried by the mudflows. The disaster gained international notoriety due in part to a photograph taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra S√°nchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment). An appeal to the government for a pump to lower the water around her was left unanswered, and she succumbed to gangrene and hypothermia after 60 hours of being trapped. Her death epitomized the tragic nature of the Armero disaster ‚Äì she could have been saved had the government responded promptly and addressed the concerns over the volcano's potency. The photograph earned the World Press Photo of the Year for \\"capturing the event of greatest journalistic importance\\". Two photographers from the Miami Herald won a Pulitzer Prize for photographing the effects of the lahar. Dr. Stanley Williams of Louisiana State University said that following the eruption, \\"With the possible exception of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately.\\" In response to the eruption, the USGS Volcano Crisis Assistance Team was formed in 1986, and the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program. The volcano erupted several more times between 1985 and 1994. =Anger over government negligence= Concerns over the alleged negligence of local officials to alert locals of the volcano's threat led to controversy. The mayor of Armero, Ramon Rodriguez and other local officials had tried to bring the volcano's potential eruption to the attention of the Colombian government, but to no avail. For months, Rodriguez appealed to various officials, including congressmen and the Governor of Tolima Department. Rodriguez once referred to the volcano as a \\"time bomb\\" and told reporters that he believed an eruption would disrupt the natural dam above Armero, resulting in floods. Despite his persistence, only one congressman managed to inquire about the reality of the situation. Reports from the Colombian Minister of Mines, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Public Works \\"all asserted that the government was aware of the risk from the volcano and was acting to protect the population\\". The lack of responsibility for the disaster prompted lawmakers to campaign for Tolima's governor (Eduardo Alzate Garcia) to resign. In the media, similar thoughts and questions were hotly debated. One of the most aggressive campaigns came from a mass funeral in Ibagu√© for the victims, claiming that \\"The volcano didn't kill 22,000 people. The government killed them.\\" Legacy Nevado del Ruiz seen from Manizales, 2006 The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to similar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to along river valleys. Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 individuals being considered to be at high risk. Lahars pose a threat to the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada.Mileti et al., p. 80. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogot√°'s airport due to ashfall. As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atenci√≥n de Desastres (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the Direcci√≥n de Prevenci√≥n y Atenci√≥n de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. When another Colombian volcano, Nevado del Huila, erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another \\"Nevado del Ruiz\\". The lessons from the Armero tragedy have inspired a lahar warning system for Mt. Rainier, which has a similar potential for lahars. Armero was never rebuilt after the tragedy. Instead, the survivors were relocated to the towns of Guayabal and L√©rida, rendering Armero a ghost town. =Commemorations= A little less than one year later, Pope John Paul II flew over Armero and then visited L√©rida's refugee camps with Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He spoke about the disaster and declared the site of Armero \\"holy land\\". Although many victims of the disaster were commemorated, Omayra S√°nchez in particular was immortalized by poems, novels, and music pieces. One work (Adios, Omayra) by Eduardo Santa illustrated the girl's last days of life and her symbolism of the catastrophe. Survivors were also recognized in Germ√°n Santa Mar√≠a Barrag√°n's dramatized television special titled \\"No Morir√°s\\" (You Will Not Die). Much of the cast was composed of victims of the tragedy who appeared at the cast calls to be extras. =Film= At the end of 2015, it was announced that Armero, a film about the tragedy, would be released sometime in 2016. Directed by Christian Mantilla, the movie tells the story of the events that took place in November 1985. The movie was released on September 21, 2017.

The definition most likely to appear in a dictionary. Discussion  Drawing from the original word or definition proposed by Saussure (1857-1913), a sign has two parts: *as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and *as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. To transmit information, both the addresser and the addressee must use the same code, whether in the literal sense, e.g. Morse Code or in the form of a language. The denotative meaning of a signifier is intended to communicate the objective semantic content of the represented thing. So, in the case of a lexical word, say \\"book\\", the intention is to do no more than describe the physical object. Any other meanings or implications will be connotative meanings. The distinction between denotation and connotation can be made in textual analysis and the existence of dictionaries is used to support the argument that the sign system begins with a simple meaning that is then glossed as new usages are developed. But this argument equally means that no sign can be separated from both its denotational and connotational meanings, and, since the addresser is always using the sign for a particular purpose in a context, no sign can be divorced from the values of the addresser. Louis Hjelmslev (1899-1965) therefore proposes that although the function of signification may be a single process, denotation is the first step, and connotation the second. Roland Barthes (1915-1980) added a third possible step in world view or Weltanschauung in which metacognitive schema such as liberty, sexuality, autonomy, etc. create a framework of reference from which more abstract meanings may be attributed to the signs, depending on the context. Barthes and others have argued that it is more difficult to make a clear distinction when analysing images. For example, how is one to interpret a photograph? In the real world, a human observer has binocular vision, but the two-dimensional picture must be analysed to determine depth and the relative size of objects depicted by applying rules of perspective, the operation of which can be confused by focus and composition. One view might be that the picture as interpreted is evidence of what it depicts and, since the technology collects and stores data from the real world, the resulting picture is a definition of what the camera was pointed at, and so denotational. Adopting the classification of Charles Sanders Peirce, this would be considered an indexical sign, i.e. there is a direct connection between the signifier and the signified. While it is true that an unedited photograph may be an index, digital technology is eroding the viewer's confidence that the image is an objective representation of reality. Further, the photographer made conscious decisions about the composition of the image, how to light it, whether to take a close-up or long shot, etc. All of these decisions represent both the intention and the values of the photographer in wishing to preserve this image. This led John Fiske to suggest that, \\"denotation is what is photographed, connotation is how it is photographed\\". Such problems become even more difficult to resolve once the audience knows that the photograph or moving image has been edited or staged. (See also modality) References *Barthes, Roland.

Having worked alongside Alexander T. M√ºller-Rodic as one of two managing directors for the professional electronic sports organization SK Gaming from 2001 to 2009, he created a popular social platform for gaming enthusiasts to congregate and to introduce a stronger awareness to a wider audience. Of Thorstensson's achievements, he is well known for his gaming tools and articles about the Counter-Strike netcode and also for Frag or Die, the single-most downloaded Counter-Strike video to date. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential innovators for esports, having assisted with establishing standards for player management and gaming communities. Beyond his esports career, he is well known for his many startups such as SPRAYdio, XSReality, ESN, Toborrow and EQT Ventures. In December 2018, Thorstensson co- founded the technology and services company, Popdog, marking his return to the esports scene. Biography =1979‚Äì1998: Early life and career= Andreas Thorstensson was born on January 29, 1979, in Stockholm, Sweden. According to Thorstensson, his intrigue with programming began in 1989, at the age of ten, with his father's purchase of the 386SX-20. In 1992, he began programming with C and had begun playing video games. Early on, Thorstensson worked to establish a foothold in the technical work industry by beginning as a senior programmer at the recently founded internet company Spray Network in August 1997, until December 1999. In the meantime, he began working as a senior programmer for Razorfish in January 1999 until December of that year. He had a year-long stint as the technical chief for the internet broadcasting company he created called SPRAYdio from January to December 2000. From January to December 2001, Thorstensson worked as a Technical Creative Director for the digital marketing company, Abel & Baker. = 1999‚Äì2009: GeekBoys and SK Gaming = Thorstensson's first widespread attention began with his creation of the news aggregator GeekBoys.org in 1999. Together with his co-workers, Thorstensson turned his attention to the fledgling medium of electronic sports, which he dedicated GeekBoys' resources as a gaming clan and news syndicate. With the popularity of GeekBoys increasing, Thorstensson, now known by the pseudonym of \\"bds\\", achieved several record-breaking feats. According to statistics, he became the single dominant global-recognized Counter-Strike demo player. As one of his most-recognized achievements as a player, Thorstensson created Frag or Die, which remains the most-popular frag display to date. Additionally, to improve the accessibility of demos, a program called GeekPlay was created, in order to allow immediate initialization of demo play. On September 23, 2001, the German electronic sports organization Schroet Kommando announced the acquisition of his Scandinavian-based team, as a second Counter-Strike squad. With the individuals of Geekboys transitioning to Schroet Kommando, the original GeekBoys website was sold to Swedes David Garpenstahl and Mattias Hjelmstedt. Over the following months, the two communities would slowly merge as the squad operated under the moniker of \\"SK.Geekboys\\". During 2001, Thorstensson was also involved with the creation of XSReality.com, which altered its name and changed hands to Englishman Sujoy Roy, eventually becoming ESReality.com. Today, ESReality remains immensely popular as an electronic sports platform. Schroet Kommando, (which was increasingly referred to as \\"SK\\"), began a revolutionizing system in electron inc sports, in which users could gain an elite status by partaking in subscription service, referred to as the \\"SK Insider\\". On February 1, 2003, Thorstensson introduced the first case of player contractual agreement with the acquisition of Ninjas in Pyjamas to join SK after they had won an early Cyberathlete Professional League Counter-Strike tournament. NiP accepted his offer due to SK's sponsorship deals with companies such as Intel, which allowed them to travel to major competitions worldwide. The resulting team was the highly popular SK.Sweden team of 2003 through 2004, which became the most dominant team the professional Counter-Strike scene has seen to date. This seemed to come to an end on January 2, 2005, when the team opted out of renewing their contracts in hopes of securing a larger share of the prize money and sponsorships with Ninjas in Pyjamas. However, later that year, on June 26, several of the team members returned to SK. During his eight years as Managing Director for SK Gaming, Thorstensson coordinated with his German counterpart, Alexander T. M√ºller-Rodic, (commonly known as \\"TheSlaSH\\"), along with SK's founder Ralf Reichert, (commonly known as \\"Griff). The three of them worked to create a business platform around SK Gaming, from which he spent the great part of the entirety of that time operating with M√ºller-Rodic. Ever since his well-known inclusion into SK Gaming, Thorstensson created several innovative and extremely popular online applications that helped accelerate the growth rate of SK Gaming's already-expansive fan base. This includes the innovative cross-realm ranking system for World of Warcraft that, while in its prime, was the single most-popular third-party cross-realm ranking system in the world. In 2008, Swedish footballer Fredrik Lundgren became a co-owner of the GeekBoys business, with 1% of the company shares, won from a football bet with Thorstensson. On December 9, 2009, Thorstensson announced his retirement from SK Gaming to further pursue his web development profession, maintaining Geekboys.org as his personal business website. = 2010-present: Recent web development = Following his departure from SK Gaming, Thorstensson continued maintaining GeekBoys as his web-based business, developing several notable websites, the first being Collected.info, a social networking platform to connect news feeds from other various websites under one account. The website was cooperatively developed by Thorstensson and the website's owners, David Sundan and Ted Persson. Thorstensson's primary project was Njuice.com, which utilizes advanced parsers to scan other networking websites for trending stories, then create an expanded network in itself. According to Alexa, Njuice was Thorstensson's most-popular website, bringing in more than one million hits monthly, which is a greater number than SK Gaming's. Alongside Sofie Lundstr√∂m, Thorstensson founded a marketplace lending platform service intended to connect consumers with small businesses in need of loans called Toborrow, alongside Sofie Lundstr√∂m in 2013. After two years of developing Toborrow, Thorstensson joined the Swedish private equity group EQT Partners as a tech partner. Though he would retain a chair on Toborrow's board, his development role was passed on to the developer Michel Radosavljevic. Over the successive three years of Thorstensson's tenure, EQT would maintain a ‚Ç¨566 million fund and develop Motherbrain, a tool for identifying promising startup ventures. Thorstensson looked to investment opportunities concerning esports to the table at EQT, to no avail. After a $9 million Series A funding round, the esports technology and services company Popdog was launched in December 2018, with Thorstensson as a co-founder, CTO and CPO - marking his return to the scene, after nine years. Joining in launching Popdog were former Evil Geniuses (EG) owner Alex Garfield as CEO, consultant Niles Heron as CSO and former EG COO Colin DeShong as CCO. The first brands acquired with Popdog's launch included the premier gaming talent agency Loaded, the world's largest analysis tool for Twitch called Noscope, as well as the Catalyst Sports & Media's e-sports section.

The northern terminus of NH 132 is at U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 25 in Ashland.  Route description  NH 132 serves as a local route closely paralleling I-93 for its entire length. This is a role usually held by US 3, however in the Lakes Region, US 3 takes a more easterly route and deviates some distance from I-93. The route's southern terminus is at NH 9 in Concord and is known locally as East Side Drive. In East Concord village, a traffic circle provides access to Shawmut Street, West Portsmouth Street, and I-93, while NH 132 exits the traffic circle on Mountain Road. Near the northern boundary of Concord, Hoit Road provides access to I-93 and US 4. Entering Canterbury the local name changes to Southwest Road, and then at Center Road (which provides access to the Canterbury town center) changes again to Northwest Road. Entering Northfield the local name becomes Concord Road, and NH 132 crosses under I-93 without interchanging. Closely paralleling the southbound lanes of I-93, it crosses under it again without an interchange, doubles back over the freeway, and has a half interchange with it just south of the twin villages of Tilton Northfield. Here the local name changes to Park Street, and after crossing a bridge over the Winnipesaukee River and entering the town of Tilton, it immediately joins US 3 along Main Street. Another interchange with I-93 occurs in the main commercial district of Tilton, and immediately after the interchange, NH 132 leaves its concurrency with US 3 to turn northbound along Sanborn Road entering the town of Sanbornton. After passing the main village of Sanbornton, NH 127 has its eastern terminus at NH 132 in the village of Gaza, at which point the name changes to Stage Road. Passing between I-93 and Hermit Lake, NH 132 crosses under the freeway again briefly entering the town of Meredith before entering New Hampton without intersecting any other roads. Intersecting with NH 104 near New Hampton School, NH 132 merges with NH 104 and goes east to have another interchange with I-93. Just east of the interchange, NH 132 leaves the concurrency and turns north on an unnamed road. NH 132 passes under I-93 twice more before leaving New Hampton and entering Ashland, just south of the main village of that town. In Ashland, the route follows Depot Street before reaching its northern terminus at US 3/NH 25 (Daniel Webster Highway) at the center of the village. History left NH 132 was once known as New Hampshire Route 3B, a designation derived from U.S. Route 3, as there is no state route numbered \\"3\\" in New Hampshire.

The smaller varieties were used for rose-water ablutions, or for hair-powdering. The larger ones, which possessed receptacles for soap-dishes, were the predecessors of the modern bathroom wash basin, or sink. Both varieties, often of very elegant form, were in extensive use throughout a large part of the 18th century and early-19th century, eventually disappearing with the advent of modern indoor plumbing.  Ancient Greece In his Pneumatics, (chapter 31) Philo of Byzantium, a Greek engineer and writer on mechanics, describes an escapement mechanism, the earliest known, as part of a washstand. A counterweighted spoon, supplied by a water tank, tips over in a basin when full releasing a pumice in the process. Once the spoon has emptied, it is pulled up again by the counterweight, closing the door on the pumice by the tightening string. Remarkably, Philon's comment that \\"its construction is similar to that of clocks\\" indicates that such escapement mechanisms were already integrated in ancient water clocks.  Eighteenth century  In its 18th-century form the washstand was called a basin stand or basin frame, and is still sometimes described as a washhand stand. Its direct, but remote, ancestor was the monastic lavabo, ranges of basins of stone, lead or marble fed from a cistern (tank). They were usually of primitive conception, and a trough common to all was probably more frequent than separate basins. Very occasionally they were of bronze adorned with enamels and blazoned with heraldry. Very similar usages obtained in castles and palaces, fixed \\"lavatories\\" being constructed in the thickness of the walls for the use of their more important residents. These arrangements were obviously intended only for the summary ablutions which, until a very late date, sufficed to even the high-born. By degrees the lavabo became portable, and a basin frame is mentioned as early as the middle of the 17th century. Examples of earlier date than the third or fourth decade of the 18th century are, however, virtually unknown. Thenceforth, until about the end of that century, this piece of furniture was usually literally a stand. It was supported upon a tripod; a circular orifice in the top received the basin, and smaller ones were provided for a soap dish and a water-bottle. Sometimes a stand for the water-jug when the basin was in use was provided below, and very commonly there was a drawer, sometimes even two drawers, below the basin. Great numbers of these stands were made to fit into corners, and a corner wash-stand is still a common object in old furniture shops. Thomas Chippendale designed such stands in an elaborate rococo fashion, as well as in simpler form. As the 18th century drew to its close the custom of using the same apartment as reception room by day and sleeping room by night produced a demand for what was called harlequin furniture pieces which were contrived a double or triple debt to pay. Thus a variety of complicated combination washstands and dressing tables were made, and fitted with mirrors and sometimes with writing conveniences and drawers for clothes. Thomas Sheraton developed astonishing ingenuity in devising a type of furniture which, if we may judge by the large number of examples still existing, must have become highly popular.  Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  WLM14ES - Barcelona Piso 1497 07 de julio de 2011 - With the beginning of the 19th century and the expansion of ideals of personal cleanliness, the washstand grew in size and importance. It acquired the form of an oblong wooden table provided, like its smaller predecessors, with orifices for basins and fitted with a brad shelf-like stretcher upon which the jugs were placed when they were removed from the basins. Ample space was provided for soap-dishes and water-bottles. These tables were single or double, for the use of one or two persons. In the first quarter of the 20th century, the wooden top of the washstand was replaced by marble, unpierced, the basins being placed upon the slab, which, in the beginning almost invariably white, were later made of red or other warm-tinted marble.

Unlike previous FM synthesizers of the era, the TX81Z was the first to offer a range of oscillator waveforms other than just sine waves, conferring the new timbres of some of its patches when compared to older, sine-only FM synths. The TX81Z has developed a famous reputation, largely based on some of its preset bass sounds. A keyboard version with more onboard editing abilities was released the following year as the Yamaha DX11. Features The unit is multitimbral, and has 128 ROM voices, 32 editable voice slots, and 24 editable Performance memories. The RAM slots were rarely utilized due to the perceived high quality and usability of the original patches and the difficulty of programming new sounds with the limited front-panel interface. Among the presets is the famous LatelyBass, one of the most popular presets in synthesizer history. The TX81Z is backwards-compatible with sound patches developed for Yamaha's DX21, DX27, and DX100 synthesizers. It is also very similar, and almost completely patch-compatible, to the DX11 synthesizer, which is essentially a TX81Z with a velocity and pressure-sensing keyboard, and a pitch envelope. Usage Some say the prevalence of the TX81Z's presets was also because of the difficulty in creating new patches. Creating new sounds from the unit's front panel is possible, but numerous nested parameters must be navigated by way of 11 buttons and a backlit 16 character, 2-line LCD. However, several personal computer-based editing applications have been developed since its release. The Dutch company KissBox released in 2013 a TX81Z editor based on RTP-MIDI communication, which makes the hardware synth appear as a VST plugin, while being controlled over a network link in real- time. The TX81Z was designed as a low-cost FM machine and has always been relatively inexpensive compared to most other FM synthesizers. The TX81Z is built around a single FM chip, the Yamaha YM2414B aka OPZ, while 6-op machines like the DX7 have separate envelope/frequency and algorithm/wave chips and created LFOs in software; this large workload in the OPZ is probably why it has fewer operators and notes. A 63B03 CPU allocates voices and generates auxiliary LFOs, in parallel with MIDI and user interface, which might be why e.g. a pitch EG was omitted; the later DX11 splits responsibilities between 2 CPUs and adds a PEG. The TX81Z can run quite quickly out of resources, especially under Performance Mode, where the 8 voices are shared between the 16 MIDI channels. It is also quite sensitive to System Exclusive messages timing when being edited remotely. Special care must be taken not to send System Exclusive messages with a delay too small between them (it can take up to 50ms for the synthesizer to process a new parameter value). The low price made the TX81Z popular with many producers on a tight budget, and is still used by part-time house and acid house producers. Eliot Kennedy uses it for one purpose, a \\"classic dancefloor bass sound.\\". Producer Babyface at one point had two units in his studio, both of which he kept set to the preset \\"LatelyBass\\", one detuned from the other; this expanded version of the preset became a part of his signature sound . TX81Z units are still fairly common and can often be found at pawn shops, second-hand music retailers, and internet auction websites. TXz is very suitable for accordion use. It can be programmed to give Four Notes Right, Three notes Chord and One Note Bass. The machine can replicate the sounds of the old style Cordovox as well as add some further interesting sounds.

Most species that reproduce by sexual reproduction are heterogamous‚Äîfemales producing larger gametes (ova) and males producing smaller gametes (sperm). In nearly all animal species, offspring are carried by the female until birth, but in fish of the family Syngnathidae (pipefish, seahorses and the leafy seadragon), males perform this function. Non-human animals The fish family Syngnathidae has the unique characteristic of a highly derived form of male brood care referred to as \\"male pregnancy\\". The family is highly diverse, containing around 300 different species of fish. Included in Syngnathidae are seahorses, the pipefish, and the weedy and leafy seadragons. The males of some of these species possess a brood pouch on the trunk or tail; in other species, the eggs are merely attached to the male's trunk or tail when the female lays them. Although biologists' definitions of pregnancy differ somewhat, all members of the family are considered by ichthyologists to display male pregnancy, even those without an external brood pouch. Fertilization may take place in the pouch or in the water before implantation, but in either case, syngnathids' male pregnancy ensures them complete confidence of paternity. After implantation in or on the brood pouch or brood patch, the male incubates the eggs. Many species osmoregulate the brood pouch fluid to maintain proper pH for the developing embryos. In at least some species, the male also provisions his offspring with nutrients such as glucose and amino acids through the highly vascularized attachment sites in or on his body. This period of incubation can take much longer than the production of another clutch of eggs by the female, especially in temperate regions where pregnancies last longer, leading to a reproductive environment in which sexual selection can be stronger on females than on males due to increased male parental investment. This reversal of traditional sex roles has only been found in pipefishes, whereas seahorses have largely been accepted as monogamous. Some pipefish species display classical polyandry because of this unique situation. Male syngnathids usually prefer females with large body size and prominent ornaments such as blue skin pigmentation or skin folds. Syngnathid males in some species are apparently capable of absorbing eggs or embryos while in the brood pouch. In these cases, embryos with the highest survival rate are those whose mothers display the preferred phenotype. Syngnathidae is the only family in the animal kingdom to which the term \\"male pregnancy\\" has been applied. Humans =Ectopic implantation= Human males do not naturally possess a uterus to gestate offspring. The theoretical issue of male ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterine cavity) by surgical implantation has been addressed by experts in the field of fertility medicine, who stress that the concept of ectopic implantation, while theoretically plausible, has never been attempted and would be difficult to justify ‚Äì even for a woman lacking a uterus ‚Äì owing to the extreme health risks to both the parent and child. Robert Winston, a pioneer of in-vitro fertilization, told London's Sunday Times that \\"male pregnancy would certainly be possible\\" by having an embryo implanted in a man's abdomen ‚Äì with the placenta attached to an internal organ such as the bowel ‚Äì and later delivered surgically.Men can have babies; Study still in infancy though: Expert Ectopic implantation of the embryo along the abdominal wall, and resulting placenta growth would, however, be very dangerous and potentially fatal for the host, and is therefore unlikely to be studied in humans. Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, a British fertility clinic, noted that the abdomen has not evolved to separate from the placenta during delivery, hence the danger of an ectopic pregnancy. Bioethicist Glenn McGee said \\"the question is not 'Can a man do it?'. It's 'If a man does have a successful [ectopic] pregnancy, can he survive it? Since 2000, several hoax web sites have appeared on the Internet purporting to describe the world's first pregnant cis man. While some rely on legitimate scientific claims, no such experiment has ever been reported. Fertility clinician Cecil Jacobson claimed to have transplanted a fertilized egg from a female baboon to the omentum in the abdominal cavity of a male baboon in the mid-1960s, which then carried the fetus for four months; however, Jacobson did not publish his claims in a scientific journal, and was subsequently convicted on several unrelated counts of fraud for ethical misconduct. =Uterus transplantation= Unlike an ectopic pregnancy which places both the fetus and host in danger, uterus transplantation into a male, if successful, would provide protection to both the fetus and host and remove much of the danger to both. According to Karine Chung, director of the fertility preservation program at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, transplanting a uterus into a human male would not be much different from transplanting one into a female, as \\"male and female anatomy is not that different.\\" The uterus would either have to be donated by a willing donor or be tissue-engineered using the male's stem cells and then implanted into his pelvic region. Afterward, the standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure would be followed to insert the fetus into the male's newly formed womb. A uterine transplant was performed in Saudi Arabia in 2000, from one woman to another, but it did not result in a pregnancy. This advance drew speculation about the possibility of a male receiving a womb transplant, and bearing a child from the transplanted womb. =Intersex people= Certain rare disorders of sex development in karyotypical (46, XY) males cause the paramesonephric ducts to develop into the M√ºllerian structures required for pregnancy, as in a female. While affected intersex women are infertile (producing no gametes), they may successfully carry and deliver a pregnancy with assisted reproductive technology (ART). There are also documented cases of individuals with XY-predominant mosaicism conceiving naturally, including a person with a 96% XY karyotype and ovotestes (true hermaphroditism). There has been a reported case of an XY-predominant woman who experienced regular menstruation, two natural pregnancies, and gave birth. =Fetus in fetu= Fetus in fetu, though not an actual pregnancy, is an extremely rare condition in which a mass of tissue resembling a fetus forms inside the body. This is a developmental abnormality in which a fertilized egg splits as if to form identical twins, but one half becomes enveloped by the other, and an entire living organ system with torso and limbs can develop inside the host. The abnormality occurs in 1 in 500,000 live births in humans.Grant P, Pearn JH Foetus-in-foetu. Med J Aust. 1969; 1:1016-1020 ‚Äî source not consulted; cited here following The case of Sanju Bhagat, also known as Sanjay Kumar, a man from Nagpur, India, attracted attention in 1999 for the length of time (36 years) he had carried his parasitic twin inside his body, and the size of the growth. Since Bhagat had no placenta, the growth had connected directly to his blood supply. In an extremely unusual case, a 2-year-old boy became pregnant with his parasitic twin inside his stomach feeding off him like a normal fetus would feed on its mother. The boy required a Caesarean section. It is virtually impossible that the fetus could survive this process due to being underdeveloped.  In popular culture  Some science fiction writers have picked up on these issues, in \\"cross-gender\\" themes‚Äîe.g., Octavia E. Butler's Bloodchild and Other Stories. Ursula K. Le Guin's novel The Left Hand of Darkness contains the sentence \\"The king was pregnant\\", and explores a society in which pregnancy can be experienced by anyone, since individuals are not sexually differentiated during most of their life and can become capable of inseminating or gestating at different times. Lois McMaster Bujold's Ethan of Athos features an all-male society in which men use artificial wombs, but experience many of the psychological effects of pregnancy (anticipation, anxiety, etc.). In Marge Piercy's feminist utopian novel Woman on the Edge of Time, neither men nor women get pregnant, leaving that to artificial wombs, but both sexes may lactate and nurse the infant; the specifically female experiences of pregnancy and nursing were opened to men in the cause of gender equality. Larry Niven's 1969 essay \\"Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex\\" ends with considering Superman as a carrier for his own baby, due to the difficulties a human female might encounter carrying a superpowered fetus. The concept of male pregnancy has been the subject of popular films, generally as a comedic device. The 1978 comedy film Rabbit Test stars Billy Crystal as a young man who inexplicably becomes pregnant instead of his female sex partner. In Monty Python's 1979 film, Life of Brian, there is a political satire scene in which a character demands that any man has a \\"right to have babies if he wants them,\\" which is ridiculed as impossible. The 1994 science fiction comedy/drama Junior stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a fertility researcher who experiments on himself; the screenplay was inspired by a 1985 article in Omni magazine. In the 2017 film Mamaboy stars Sean O'Donnell as Kelly Hankins as a teenager who decides to undergo an experimental procedure that enables him to carry his girlfriend's baby to term. The concept appears frequently as a comedic gag in numerous television programs as well. In a 1981 episode of the Canadian sketch comedy series Bizarre, the show‚Äôs resident daredevil character Super Dave Osborne (Bob Einstein) performs, as one of his many stunts, carrying and giving birth to a baby. The 1990 BBC television comedy drama Frankenstein's Baby features a Dr. Eva Frankenstein helping a male patient to become the world's first pregnant man. In the BBC science fiction comedy series Red Dwarf, the main character Dave Lister becomes pregnant after having sex with a female version of himself in an alternate universe. In an episode of Sliders, the quartet \\"slides\\" into an alternate world in which babies develop during their final months in the father because a worldwide disease has kept women from being able to carry children beyond their first trimester. In the popular fantasy series Charmeds fifth season, during a dream spell gone wrong, Leo ends up pregnant with Piper's baby for a good deal of the episode, leading to her referring to him as an \\"incubator\\" and at times berating him for \\"upsetting the baby\\". In Doctor Who (series 11), an episode features a man going into labor pain. In the Ozzy & Drix episode \\"Ozzy Jr.\\", Ozzy thinks he is having a baby but is actually a parasite growing in his belly caused by an infection by Strepfinger. In the Ren & Stimpy \\"Adult Party Cartoon\\" episode \\"Stimpy's Pregnant\\", Stimpy is thought to be pregnant but Mr. Horse finds out that he is actually constipated. The possibility of extraterrestrial life having different reproductive sexuality is the basis for many references. In the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Unexpected\\", Trip Tucker becomes pregnant with the offspring of a female of another species. In the video game The Sims 2 male characters can be impregnated via cheat codes or alien abduction. In the American Dad! episode \\"Deacon Stan, Jesus Man\\", the boy Steve becomes impregnated after giving the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the extraterrestrial Roger, then unwittingly passes it on to his girlfriend via a kiss. In the animated series Futurama, the extraterrestrial Kif can be impregnated by a touch. In the SciFi Channel miniseries, Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, the extraterrestrial Rygel becomes impregnated with human John and Aeryn's baby. In the series Alien Nation, when Tectonese main character George Francisco and his wife Susan decide to have a third child, it is revealed that, in order to conceive, a Tectonese couple needs a third party, called a binnaum, to complete impregnation, and that the male carries the baby‚Äîencased in a pod‚Äîduring the final months of gestation. In the animated series The Fairly OddParents in the TV film Fairly OddBaby, the fairy Cosmo was pregnant of Baby Poof. Additionally, Robert Sheckley's 1989 short story Love Song From the Stars also contains this element. In an episode of My Friends from Afar, Xiang Lin was pregnant, but the baby turned out to be an egg. In the Ben 10: Alien Force episode \\"Save the Last Dance\\", it is revealed that Necrofriggians have an ability to asexually reproduce once every 80 years, building a large nest made of digested metal where their eggs will hatch and their offspring will feed on the metal, first eating from the nest before they instinctively feed on solar plasma until they mature and starts their own separate lives. Due to the Necrofriggian reproduction cycle, Big Chill overtook Ben's personality to carry out the process, but Ben did not remember anything he did as Big Chill during this cycle, like eating metal and having 14 babies, and he felt very embarrassed when Gwen, Kevin and Julie explained, and Kevin's teasing and calling him \\"mommy\\" did not help. In The Three Stooges episode \\"Even as IOU\\" Curly accidentally swallows a Vitamin Z pill meant for a horse. However, the error allows Curly to give birth to an Equidae, which the Stooges crown as a winning race horse. Virgil Wong, a performance artist, created a hoax site featuring a fictitious male pregnancy, claiming to detail the pregnancy of his friend Lee Mingwei.Hoax website: Lee Mingwei. Mingwei Refers to hoax as \\"Male Pregnancy Project, Centre d‚ÄôArt Santa Monica, Barcelona, Spain\\" Male pregnancy is also commonly explored in slash (homosexual) fan fiction, usually based upon fantasy series such as Supernatural or Harry Potter.

In 1954, it was turned over to the South Vietnamese government, who continued to use it for the same purpose. Notable prisoners held at C√¥n S∆°n in the 1930s included Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng, Nguy·ªÖn An Ninh and L√™ ƒê·ª©c Th·ªç. Not far from the prison is H√†ng D∆∞∆°ng Cemetery, where some of the prisoners were buried. =Republic of Vietnam=  \\"Tiger cages\\"  During the Vietnam War, prisoners who had been held at the prison in the 1960s were abused and tortured. In July 1970, two U.S. Congressional representatives, Augustus Hawkins and William Anderson, visited the prison. They were accompanied by Tom Harkin (then an aide), translator Don Luce, and USAID Office of Public Safety Director Frank Walton. When the delegation arrived at the prison, they departed from the planned tour, guided by a map drawn by a former detainee. The map led to the door of a building, which was opened from the inside by a guard when he heard the people outside the door talking. Inside they found prisoners were being shackled within cramped \\"tiger cages\\". Prisoners began crying out for water when the delegation walked in. They had sores and bruises, and some were mutilated. Harkin took photos of the scene. The photos were published in Life magazine on July 17, 1970. Recreations of tiger cages can be seen today at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. In response, Phil Crane, a Republican from Illinois, visited C√¥n S∆°n and stated that the visit and photos were \\"distortions of truth.\\" The tiger cages, he said, were \\"cleaner than the average Vietnamese home.\\"Perlstein, p 515 The prison on C√¥n S∆°n Island was closed in 1975 after the Fall of Saigon. The facilities were reopened with improved conditions some years later however, to temporarily incarcerate boat people captured by local coast guards until the late 1980s. LORAN Station Con Son At the request of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the U.S. Coast Guard started pre-construction plans for a chain of Loran-C radio stations to serve Southeast Asia 15 January 1966 in support of Operation Tight Reign during the Vietnam War.Larzelere, p 193Scotti, p 91 The actual construction of Station Con Son began during April with the delivery of construction materials by and award of construction contracts to Morrison- Knudsen Corp. and Brown and Root Company.Larzelere, p 200 Station Con Son was one of five stations in the Southeast Asia chain and was designated SH-3 Yankee. It consisted of a tower, transmitter equipment buildings, fuel tanks, generators and barracks for personnel located on the north end of Con Son Island. The personnel complement for the station was two officers and 23 enlisted men. After commissioning on 2 September 1966 the station began the testing phase of operations and the five station chain was fully operational by 0400 on 28 October,Scotti, p 94 just nine months after the initial request from the Department of Defense.Johnson, p 337Larzelere, p 203 The station provided, along with its sister stations in the chain, signals that allowed aircraft and ships to receive accurate all-weather positioning data for navigation purposes. During January 1973 the operation of the station was turned over to civilian contractors who were responsible to the United States Coast Guard for all functions of the station. The Coast Guard continued to supply logistical and technical support on an as needed basis.Larzelere, p 270 When the fall of the South Vietnamese government was imminent, Station Con Son was directed to stay on the air until the last possible minute to provide navigation signals to aircraft and ships fleeing South Vietnam. Station Con Son stayed on the air until 1246 local time on 29 April 1975 after the crew oversped the generators and damaged critical pieces of electronic gear.Larzelere, p 278 Climate Notes ;Citations ;References cited   * Further reading * *  External links  * The Con Dao Archipelago * The Tiger Cages of Con Son * THEN THE AMERICANS CAME ‚Äì Mrs. Truong My Hoa * The Kun Lun Shan islands are shown on sheet 11 of the Mao Kun map Wu Bei Zhi at the Library of Congress Category:Islands of Vietnam Category:Defunct prisons in Vietnam Category:War crimes in Vietnam Category:Vietnam War prisoner of war camps Category:Vietnam War sites Category:Landforms of B√† R·ªãa- V≈©ng T√†u Province Category:Torture in Vietnam Category:Islands of the South China Sea Category:1702 establishments in the British Empire Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in Asia ","title":"C√¥n S∆°n Island"},{"id":"2094397","text":"Jean is a small commercial town in Clark County, Nevada, United States, located approximately north of the Nevada‚ÄìCalifornia state line along Interstate 15. Las Vegas is located about to the north. There are no residents of Jean, but many people in nearby communities such as Primm and Sandy Valley have Jean listed in their mailing address because it is the location of the main post office for the 89019 ZIP code. South Las Vegas Boulevard ends about south of Jean, and it contiguously runs northbound past Las Vegas, ending near the I-15‚ÄìUS 93 Junction. The area is mostly commercial, with the exception of the post office and the courthouse, with commercial outlets such as Terrible's Hotel & Casino, the Jean Sport Aviation Center (used for activities like skydiving), Jean Conservation Camp (a minimum-security, all female Nevada Department of Corrections facility established in 1987) and a Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP) substation. The Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino was also located here but it was demolished in April 2008 and the sign was removed in 2010. The Jean Post Office is located on Las Vegas Boulevard in Jean. The Goodsprings Township Courthouse is also located in Jean. History The town was originally named Goodsprings Junction. On June 28, 1905, postmaster George Arthur Fayle renamed it Jean in honor of his wife. He also built the Pioneer Saloon in Goodsprings. Pop's Oasis Casino was the first casino in Jean. The Oasis closed in 1988. Chips and tokens from Pop's Oasis were poured into the foundation of the Nevada Landing. When the Nevada Landing was leveled in May 2008 these chips and tokens, some embedded in concrete, were found by collectors. The welcome center was moved to Primm in early 2000. The original welcome center was converted to a Nevada Highway Patrol substation in 2004. The median between the Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino and the Gold Strike Hotel and Gambling Hall was the scene of the worst single-vehicle accident in Southern Nevada history at that time, when a van with 13 people flipped over and eight people were killed. The accident occurred in March 2000. The Nevada Landing Casino closed in March 2007. The Gold Strike remained open and was renamed as Terrible's in 2018. The world‚Äôs largest Chevron gas station, with 96 pumps, opened across from the former site of the Nevada Landing in 2018. In the early 1970s, the Southern Nevada Timing Association, a Las Vegas car club, operated a 1/4 mile National Hot Rod Association sanctioned dragstrip on the old L.A. highway just south of town. This strip was opened due to the fact that the Stardust raceway had closed and there was no place to race legally. The local Lions Club and the Clark County Sheriff's Department also sanctioned drag racing here. The lengths of guard rail required by NHRA were installed on each side and a small observation tower was built. There were no timing or starting lights, all starts were by a flagger. The finish line was viewed by a club member who would go up on the track after the cars went by and stand in the winner's lane to show who won. His decision was final. Races were run every weekend unless the weather proved dangerous to racers. Races were even run at night with the rental of a huge arc type spotlight that was projected down the track from the starting line. The track was closed when the Las Vegas Speedrome opened across from Nellis Air Force Base. That track is now named The Strip at Las Vegas. Geography Jean is located on a mountain pass, Jean Pass (south), west of the Jean Dry Lake basin. Sheep Mountain borders Jean to the east, southeast of Jean Dry Lake. Northwest of the pass lies the southeast foothills of the Bird Spring Range. Installation venue Gold Strike Casino in Jean The sign marking the location of the former Nevada Landing Casino The area around Jean has been the site of several installation art exhibits, including Study for An End of the World, No. 2 in 1962 when Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle blew up sculptures.

He is perhaps best known for his role in the 1998 film Ronin and his lead in the TV drama Third Watch. Biography =Personal life= Born in Wareham, Massachusetts, the son of an engineer and a nurse, Sudduth attended George Washington High School in Danville, Virginia. Sudduth then earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Hampden-Sydney College (H-SC). He is the older brother of actor Kohl Sudduth. =Career= He worked for a year as Director of Alumni Relations at his alma mater in the administration of the college's then-new president Josiah Bunting III, author of The Lionheads and future commandant of Virginia Military Institute in Lexington. Sudduth then worked for a year as apprentice to the winemaker with poet and vintner Tom O'Grady at Rose Bower Vineyard and Winery. At that time, Rose Bower was only the seventh Estate Vineyard to be licensed in Virginia since the time of Thomas Jefferson. During this period, Sudduth was acting in community and campus theater and writing original comedy and directing and producing the annual comedy review, Parting Shots, at H-SC. The following year, he returned to school entering the acting program in the Department of Drama at the University of Virginia. At UVA he met and worked with his first and most dynamic acting teacher, Spencer Golub, who would go on to head the Drama Department at Brown University. Golub's emphasis on physically liberating the imagination through extensive guided improvisation became the foundation for Sudduth's approach to acting. Sudduth acted extensively during his time at UVA playing leading roles in Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, Sam Shepard's Curse of the Starving Class (opposite Nip/Tuck's Dylan Walsh), and Peter Shaffer's Equus, which featured the first full male and female nudity ever allowed on stage in a production at UVA. Sudduth received his Masters of Fine Arts degree in acting from UVA in 1985. Sudduth moved to Chicago in December 1985 aspiring to work with the acclaimed Steppenwolf Theater Company. During his four and a half years in Chicago, Sudduth played in many stage productions including Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Emily Mann's Execution of Justice, and Nebraska (by screenwriter John Logan, who penned The Aviator). He has appeared in stage adaptations of The Grapes of Wrath, On the Waterfront and A Clockwork Orange, and acted in the 1999 Broadway production of The Iceman Cometh (alongside Kevin Spacey) and the 2003 debut performance of Woody Allen's play Riverside Drive (starring with Paul Reiser). He also appeared in Twelfth Night at Lincoln Center (with Helen Hunt). Sudduth's movie career has seen him play numerous small parts in 54 (1998), A Cool, Dry Place (1998), and Spike Lee's Clockers (1995), as well larger roles with Robert De Niro in Ronin (1998) and Flawless (1999). Sudduth, who is a keen amateur racing/stunt driver, performed nearly all of the driving his character does in Ronin. Skipp Sudduth had a recurring role in the TV soap opera One Life to Live, but is better known for his portrayal of NYPD officer John \\"Sully\\" Sullivan in the NBC drama Third Watch. Sudduth appeared in all six seasons of the show and his character is one of the leading ensemble of eight around whom the underlying story arc revolves. He earned his Directors Guild of America card directing the episode \\"Collateral Damage, Part II\\" in season 4. Sudduth has also made guest appearances in Homicide: Life on the Street, Law & Order, Oz, Trinity, Cosby, and Mad About You. The multi-talented Sudduth is also a singer-songwriter; his acoustic-rock band Minus Ted has released three albums: Hope and Damage (1994), Really Really (1999) and Hope and Damage Revisited (2005). The last two are available on iTunes. He was a member of New York's Rumble in the Redroom comedy troupe (1996‚Äì99) and has recorded several notable audio books including one short story in the acclaimed Stephen King collection, Just After Sunset and Peter Canellos's biography of Ted Kennedy, Last Lion: The Fall and Rise of Ted Kennedy, both for Simon & Schuster. In 2008, Sudduth created the role of Captain George Brackett in the Tony-Award-winning revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific at Lincoln Center. Sudduth finished the year appearing in the New York premiere of Prayer for My Enemy, a play by Craig Lucas. The play was the second time Sudduth worked with director Bartlett Sher who had also directed South Pacific. The production ran at the off-Broadway theater Playwright's Horizons from November 14 to December 21 and also featured Victoria Clark, Michele Pawk, and Jonathan Groff. In the play, Sudduth played a recovering alcoholic coping with his son's return from the Iraq War. Sudduth officially began his career as a director during his years in the cast of Third Watch by directing one episode in each of the last three years of the series. Since then, Sudduth has directed episodes of ER, Criminal Minds, Women's Murder Club, CSI: Cyber, and multiple episodes of CSI: NY. He is currently at work developing projects for film, television, and theater. He has recently starred on the short lived police drama NYC 22 as NYPD Detective Tommy Luster.

Stewart and Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland. Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast. (HB) Distribution The native range of the species lies within North America, but it has been introduced in many parts of the world either intentionally or not. Europe has been particularly affected with the first record dating back as far as 1836. Since then, the species' presence has been confirmed in all continental European countries. Records of the species' presence in Ireland include: County Galway, found at several sites along the Eglinton Canal, County Galway,Pybus, C. and O'Halloran, P. 2009. Distribution of some submerged aquatic macrophytes in the Eglinton Canal, Galway; Ir. Nat J. 30: 51 -53 County Down. and from the Lagan Canal near Lisburn, Northern Ireland.Hackney, P. 1992 Description Young plants initially start with a seedling stem with roots growing in mud at the bottom of the water; further adventitious roots are produced at intervals along the stem, which may hang free in the water or anchor into the bottom. It grows indefinitely at the stem tips, and single specimens may reach lengths of 3 m or more. The leaves are bright green, translucent, oblong, 6‚Äì17 mm long and 1‚Äì4 mm broad, borne in whorls of three (rarely two or four) round the stem. It lives entirely underwater, the only exception being the small white or pale purple flowers which float at the surface and are attached to the plant by delicate stalks. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on different plants. The flowers have three small white petals; male flowers have 4.5‚Äì5 mm petals and nine stamens, female flowers have 2‚Äì3 mm petals and three fused carpels. The fruit is an ovoid capsule, about 6 mm long containing several seeds that ripen underwater. The seeds are 4‚Äì5 mm long, fusiform, glabrous (round), and narrowly cylindrical. It flowers from May to October.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . It grows rapidly in favorable conditions and can choke shallow ponds, canals, and the margins of some slow- flowing rivers. It requires summer water temperatures of 10‚Äì25 ¬∞C and moderate to bright lighting. It is closely related to Elodea nuttallii, which generally has narrower leaves under 2 mm broad. It is usually fairly easy to distinguish from its relatives, like the Brazilian Egeria densa and Hydrilla verticillata. These all have leaves in whorls around the stem; however, Elodea usually has three leaves per whorl, whereas Egeria and Hydrilla usually have four or more leaves per whorl. Egeria densa is also a larger, bushier plant with longer leaves.Native Freshwater Plants: American Waterweed  Cultivation and uses  It is frequently used as an aquarium plant. Propagation is by cuttings.Hiscock, P. (2003). Encyclopedia of Aquarium Plants Interpret Publishing, United States and Canada . It is an invasive species in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. It was introduced into County Down, Ireland in about 1836, and appeared in Great Britain in 1841, spreading through both countries in ponds, ditches and streams, which were often choked with its rank growth.Flora of NW Europe: Elodea canadensis Other common names for this plant include Anacharis (an older name for the genus Elodea), water thyme, common elodea, and ditch moss.

The team consisted of three well-known Mexican wrestlers of the late 1990s: Super Crazy, Psicosis and Juventud. The stable became a tag team when their unofficial leader Juventud was released from WWE on January 6, 2006. The team's gimmick was that of a group of Mexican wrestlers who were fed up with the stereotypical portrayals of Mexicans in the United States as laborers for the \\"gringos.\\" They frequently parodied this view of Mexicans with their interviews and skits. Following their release from WWE, the group has reformed on the independent circuit in various promotions. History = World Wrestling Entertainment (2005‚Äì2006)= The Mexicools made their debut as villains on June 23, 2005, when all three members rode to the ring on a John Deere lawn mower, with the sticker saying the more Hispanic-sounding name Juan Deere, and wearing matching coveralls. They attacked both Chavo Guerrero and Paul London during a WWE Cruiserweight Championship match. Juventud cut a promo questioning the lack of \\"true Mexican Luchadores\\" in WWE's cruiserweight division, before going on to deride the current state of Mexican Americans in general. Psicosis dubbed the lawnmower they arrived on a \\"Mexican Limo 2005\\" and the group claimed that even Mexico's President mocks Mexicans in the United States (referring to Vicente Fox's controversial remark that Mexican immigrants do the jobs \\"not even the blacks want to do\\"). Juventud then stated that they were \\"no longer there to clean toilets and work for \\"them\\" (the \\"gringos\\") but \\"they\\" were going to be working for \\"us\\" (The Mexicools)\\", before dubbing the team \\"not Mexicans but Mexicools!\\" In the following weeks, they would continue to interfere in matches and mock the stereotypical image of Mexicans in the United States, even coming to the ring each with their own riding lawnmower. They had their debut match on the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, a victory over Paul London, Funaki and Scotty 2 Hotty. They made their pay-per-view debut at The Great American Bash, defeating the reunited Blue World Order. In the following weeks, they would interfere in matches involving William Regal and in Christian's \\"Peep Show\\" interview segment. The Mexicools next feuded with the heel Full Blooded Italians on Velocity, and this saw the group turn into fan favorites. Juventud won a Cruiserweight Battle Royal that included all three Mexicools, thus earning a match for the Cruiserweight Championship at No Mercy. Juventud would win the match against Nunzio at No Mercy and the title. The Mexicools would then turn their attention to winning the WWE Tag Team Championship. Juventud lost the Cruiserweight Championship back to Nunzio at a house show in Italy. That week, on the SmackDown! Tribute Show to Eddie Guerrero all three Mexicools participated in an interpromotional battle royal, which Juventud won. On the November 25 SmackDown!, Juventud defeated Nunzio to become the Cruiserweight Champion once more. On the December 2 SmackDown!, Psicosis and Super Crazy won a number one contenders battle royal to face tag champions MNM at Armageddon. This became just a regular tag team match after MNM lost the WWE Tag Team Championship on the last SmackDown! before Armageddon to Rey Mysterio and Batista. At Armageddon Juventud lost the Cruiserweight Championship to Kid Kash, and MNM defeated Super Crazy and Psicosis with help from Melina. Psicosis, One of the three members of The Mexicools After repeated backstage problems, Juventud was released from WWE on January 6, 2006, leaving Psicosis and Super Crazy as the only remaining team members. On February 3, 2006, Super Crazy and Psicosis bounced back by nearly defeating MNM for the WWE Tag Team Championship. They appeared to have the gold in the grasp, but their dreams of winning the titles went up in smoke when Melina hit Super Crazy with her boot as he went for a moonsault. MNM capitalized and retained. Following Juventud's departure from WWE, Psicosis and Super Crazy slowly started to diminish as a tag team. Crazy would see success as a singles superstar, winning most of his major matches, including a triple threat number one contendership match for the Cruiserweight Championship against Nunzio and Kid Kash. Psicosis failed to appear on WWE television for several weeks. Following Super Crazy's loss to Gregory Helms for the title at Judgment Day, he and Psicosis reunited. Split (2006) Seeds of a split seemed to appear in mid-2006 around the same time as the redevelopment of the ECW brand. During a tag-team match on Velocity the Mexicools faced the reigning WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Although both teams respected each other during the match, Psicosis used the ropes to pick up an illegal pinfall to win the match. This led to Super Crazy questioning Psicosis' actions. Next, during a SmackDown! broadcast, Psicosis left Crazy to be attacked by The Great Khali after a match, saving his own skin and leaving his tag team partner to fend for himself. Psicosis would later abandon Crazy during a handicap match against Khali. On the June 23 edition of SmackDown!, Super Crazy and Psicosis got into a fist-fight after various miscommunications throughout the match, marking the split of the team. The two were still billed as members of the faction in the following weeks, even though they were interfering in each other's matches, until they had a match on an episode of SmackDown! which was won by Super Crazy. After the split, Super Crazy was moved to the Raw brand, while Psicosis stayed on SmackDown!. On November 1, 2006, Psicosis' WWE contract was officially terminated by WWE because of his arrest in Mexico for stealing a car. = Independent circuit (2008‚Äì2019) = The group has regularly teamed together on the independent circuit in Mexico and the United States following their WWE stint.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=529&page;=4&search;=Juventudhttps://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=164&page;=4&search;=Juventud Championships and accomplishments *World Wrestling Entertainment **WWE Cruiserweight Championship (2 times) ‚Äì Juventud See also *The Filthy Animals *The Latino World Order References External links *Super Crazy's WWE profile *The Mexicools' Online World of Wrestling profile Category:WWE teams and stables ","title":"The Mexicools"},{"id":"2094509","text":"Franklin \\"Lin\\" Biviano is an American jazz trumpeter best known for his powerful lead trumpet playing with Buddy Rich, Count Basie, and Maynard Ferguson.

See connotation. In semiotics, connotation arises when the denotative relationship between a signifier and its signified is inadequate to serve the needs of the community. A second level of meanings is termed connotative. These meanings are not objective representations of the thing, but new usages produced by the language group. Discussion Drawing from the original definition proposed by Saussure (1857‚Äì1913), a sign has two parts: *as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, or hear, and *as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. Connotative meanings are developed by the community and do not represent the inherent qualities of the thing or concept originally signified as the meaning. The addition of such meanings introduces complexity into the coding system. If a signifier has only a single denotational meaning, the use of the sign will always be unambiguously decoded by the audience. But connotative meanings are context-dependent, i.e. the addresser must learn how to match the meaning intended by the addresser to one of the various possible meanings held in memory. The power of connotation is that it enables the addresser to more easily consider abstract concepts and to introduce subtlety into the discourse. For example, a digital thermometer produces a numerical value that indicates the current state of a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an indexical sign of heat (adopting the classification of Charles Sanders Peirce (1839‚Äì1914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual trope, in this case a metaphor, for the health of the body. Such information adds to other data forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative cognitive level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of symbolic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature. Connotation is concerned with how the sign system is used in each message. The semantic content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's values and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by paradigms and syntagms excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, subjective tests such as the commutation test have been developed to map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different fonts for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of synonyms and antonyms clarifies connotational choices as between, say, pejorative and euphemistic usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture‚Äîfor example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural myths and prejudices which are less reasonable. References *Barthes, Roland. Elements of Semiology (trans. Annette Lavers & Colin Smith).

It had a continuous lineage (in various forms) of more than 200 years. For much of the mid-20th Century, it had the largest circulation in the city. History The entity known as the News American was formed by a final merger of two papers, the Baltimore News- Post and The Baltimore Sunday American, in 1964, after a 191-year history and weaning process. Those newspapers each had a long history before the merger, in particular the Baltimore American which could trace its lineage unbroken to at least 1796, and, traditionally, it claimed even earlier antecedents to 1773. Other precursor newspapers The News and the Baltimore Post were founded in 1873 and 1922, respectively, and broke new ground in graphics, technology, journalistic style, and quality of writing and reporting. For most of the last two-thirds of the 19th Century, the buildings of the two main newspapers of the city faced each other across South Street along East Baltimore Street, with The Sun's \\"Iron Building\\" of revolutionary cast iron front design reflecting the earliest \\"skyscraper\\" construction technique of 1851. Built opposite later in 1873, was The News office/printing establishment featured a mansard roof and a corner clock tower. Longtime owner/editor Charles H. Grasty, who bought the Evening News in 1892, directed the newspaper's coverage of the burgeoning, gritty late-19th Century city, using advanced presses and techniques of graphics, line drawings. and larger headlines in the short days before the advent of printed page photographs. Competing with \\"the other paper\\" across the street, bulletin boards, chalk boards across the second floor front of the building and hawking \\"newsies\\" (newspaper delivery boys) with the latest news, telegraphed election results made the intersection the hottest place to be in the Victorian downtown central district. All this perished in smoke with the \\"Great Baltimore Fire\\" of February 1904, which burned out both buildings. Publication was temporarily shifted to other neighboring cities such as Washington, D.C. Charles and Baltimore Streets, at the geographic center of Baltimore, became the site of a new marble Beaux Arts classicalstyle publishing offices for The Sunpapers for the next 45 years. The corner was nicknamed \\"Sun Square.\\" The Baltimore American had a towering office skyscraper, the American Building, quickly rebuilt on the same site with a distinctive elaborate green ground floor with gold lettering showing the newspaper's logo and masthead and the dates 1773 and 1904 over the doorways. An additional printing plant several blocks south was located on East Pratt between South and Commerce streets, facing what then was called \\"The Basin\\" and its wharves, and today is known as the Inner Harbor. It, too, was built after the 1904 Great Fire, which devastated most of downtown Baltimore. An additional office building a block north, facing East Lombard Street, was built later in 1924 and supplemented with a more modern printing plant between the two buildings along the South Street side in 1965 after the final merger of the News-Post and the American. The South Street complex was torn down several years after the newspaper's closing in 1986, and remained a parking lot and a source of controversy for Inner Harbor area redevelopment. With the construction of a massive tower initially named Commerce Place (which later became headquarters, and renamed for the longtime local investment/financial/banking firm Alex. Brown & Sons following take-over by Germany's Deutsche Bank) on the block between South and Commerce streets in 1991, the intersection and battleground of Baltimore and South Streets (and intersecting North Street [later Guilford Avenue]) today are now relatively unknown for the \\"Newspaper Wars\\" that ebbed and flowed there through most of the 1800s. Also one of the casualties of \\"The Great Fire\\" was the Baltimore Morning Herald which had been founded in February 1900 and combined with the Baltimore Evening Herald on August 31, 1904, six months after sustaining the damage from having its headquarters building at the northwestern corner of St. Paul and East Fayette Streets consumed by the blaze although the new massive City Circuit Courthouse (now the Clarence Mitchell, Jr. Courthouse) just to the east across the street, recently completed four years earlier, was unharmed. The new editor, employed for only four years so far since graduating from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, young Henry Louis Mencken was thrown out of his office and arrangements had to be made to print the paper in another city and ship them back into Baltimore. Several years later, in June 1906, The Herald was bought out by competitors Grasty and his News joined with Gen. Felix Agnus, owner/publisher of the venerable The Baltimore American and the staff, assets and resources divided between the two older papers that were now the largest in the city. Mencken described his early reporting years in the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy Newspaper Days published in 1941. The Baltimore American, claimed to be a direct descendant of the original Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser was founded in 1773 and had a long-time editor/publisher with C.C. Fulton during the middle 19th Century. After the American Civil War, Felix Agnus, returned from the war and settled in Baltimore and became manager of the American and eventually married the Fulton's daughter. Within a decade, he became the editor and publisher following the death of Fulton. Agnus, who was born in Paris and having earlier served in the Imperial French Army of Napoleon III, was a major with the 165th New York Regiment and late in the war he was breveted a brigadier general in March 1865, and he continued using the title after retiring. He became very active in a variety of civic, social and political affairs of the city, including heading up the Centre Market Commission, which was responsible for rebuilding the Market Place after the devastation caused by the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904. He was also very proud that his new skyscraper for the American was the first to be completed in early 1905 in the \\"burnt district.\\" He died in October 1925 at 86, several years after selling the paper to a very controversial and often hated man in America. William Randolph Hearst's Hearst Company newspaper empire acquired the morning American from Agnus and the afternoon News from Grasty in 1923 from another newspaper mogul Frank A. Munsey (who also owned the New York Herald, New York Sun, New York Telegraph and Washington Times). Known as the \\"Dealer in Dailies\\" and the \\"Undertaker of Journalism\\", Munsey purchased The News in 1908, just two years after the paper had been forced out from its burned-out headquarters across from The Sun into a new skyscraper and publishing tower at the southeast corner of North Calvert Street and East Fayette Street (across from the Battle Monument Square, which had survived untouched on the northern edge of the \\"Burnt District\\"). As the first non-resident owner of The American in its already long history, but not satisfied with this new property of The News headquarters, Munsey promptly tore it down just a few years later and rebuilt it in 1911 in larger and grander style as the then briefly tallest building in Baltimore, designed by the famed architectural firms of Baldwin & Pennington of Baltimore and McKim, Mead and White of New York City and named it The Munsey Building, with large ground-floor windows so passers-by could see the massive printing presses which printed the day's papers. Mumsey also became the owner of a new large local bank known as The Munsey Trust Company, founded in 1913 and later reorganized in 1915 into The Equitable Trust Company with Munsey as chairman of the board. It became one of the city and state's largest financial empires into the 1990s. However, by 1924, when The News moved to new offices and printing presses at East Pratt and Commerce Streets facing the waterfront's wharves, the building was again renovated into the bank's headquarters for the next seventy years until another transformation after a series of bank mergers and out-of-town ownership take-overs in the early 2000s made it into apartments and condos. The Scripps-Howard Baltimore Post, a late-comer to the local newspaper scene, founded 1922 was later acquired and merged with The News by the Hearst Company in 1936 to create the Baltimore News-Post under the Hearst banner along with the old ancient The Baltimore American, which was published now only on Sundays. In 1964, the News-Post and American became published as The News American with a newly designed masthead logo and vignette (sketch) and was now the largest circulation daily in Baltimore, especially prominent in the working-class and blue-collar districts until the early 1970s. A series of format changes and staff realignments alienated many readers under a new editing regime in 1977, along with new problems delivering an afternoon paper through the after-work day traffic congestion (\\"drive time\\") to the outer suburbs and changing evening leisure habits of the middle classes not allowing much time for paper reading so circulation slowly declined after it had been the largest in the metro area. After the paper's last edition was published on May 27, 1986 with the headline: \\"SO LONG, BALTIMORE\\", its demise left The Baltimore Sun (founded 1837, it had just coincidentally been sold several weeks earlier by the longtime family publishers A.S. Abell Company to the national syndicate and newspaper chain Times-Mirror Company of the Los Angeles Times) as the sole broad-circulation daily in Baltimore, but it was not announced publicly until after the surprise folding of its main competitor. The stunning news of the multimillion-dollar sale was just announced several days after equally stunning closure of News American, leaving The Sun published in the morning and The Evening Sun (founded 1910) in the afternoon as the only papers left. Separate staffs and content were maintained until the early 1990s when the editions became similar until September 15, 1995, when the evening paper was finally dis-continued with a sad banner \\"GOOD NIGHT, HON\\" and many of its features and staff combined with the morning paper, which eventually was renamed and publicized as The Baltimore Sun by 2005. In 2000, Times-Mirror Company merged with the Tribune Company of the Chicago Tribune to form a larger syndicate including The Baltimore Sun, which later entered into bankruptcy in 2009 for four years after being acquired by billionaire investor Sam Zell. =Lineage= Baltimore American April 1912 * 1773: Maryland Journal and the Baltimore Advertiser * 1796‚Äì1798: Eagle of Freedom; or, the Baltimore Town and Fell‚Äôs Point Gazette * 1798‚Äì1799: Baltimore Intelligencer * 1799‚Äì1802: American and Daily Advertiser (also published as the American and Baltimore Daily Advertiser and the American and Mercantile Daily Advertiser) * 1802‚Äì1853: American and Commercial Daily Advertiser * 1854‚Äì1856: American and Commercial Advertiser (also Baltimore Weekly American) * 1857‚Äì1861: Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser * 1861‚Äì1869: American and Commercial Advertiser * 1870‚Äì1883: Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser * 1883‚Äì1964: Baltimore American Baltimore News * 1873‚Äì1875: Evening News * 1876‚Äì1892: Baltimore Daily News * 1892‚Äì1934: Baltimore NewsBaltimore News Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

She operated in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean during the Second World War. She was later used as a barracks ship and then a prison ship in Northern Ireland. Facilities She was built to support the increasing number of submarines, especially on distant stations, such as the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Far East. Her equipment included a foundry, coppersmith's, plumber's and carpenter's shops, heavy and light machine shops, electrical and torpedo repair shops and plants for charging submarine batteries. She was designed to look after nine operational submarines, supplying over 100 torpedoes and a similar number of mines. Besides large workshops, there were repair facilities for all material in the attached submarines and extensive diving and salvage equipment was carried. There were steam laundries, a cinema, hospital, chapel, two canteens, a bakery, barber's shop, and a fully equipped operating theatre and dental surgery. Career =Second World War= Maidstone in Algiers Harbour Winston Churchill meets submarine commanders in Algiers aboard Maidstone during the War In September 1939 Maidstone was depot ship to the ten submarines of the 1st Submarine Flotilla. In March 1941 she went to Gibraltar. From November 1942, Maidstone was based at Algiers Harbour, the main Allied base in the Mediterranean. In November 1943 she was assigned to the Eastern Fleet. In September 1944 Maidstone and the 8th Submarine Flotilla were transferred from Ceylon to Fremantle in Western Australia to operate in the Pacific. In late 1945 Maidstone left Fremantle, and en route to the UK, docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simonstown, South Africa. While on passage, she was diverted to Macassar to pick up 400 British naval prisoners of war from , HMS Encounter and HMS Stronghold. In November 1945 she arrived at Portsmouth. During the war Maidstone was adopted by the Borough of Maidstone as part of Warship Week. The plaque from this adoption is held by the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.Warship Weeks: Adopting Naval Vessels in World War Two  Royal Naval Museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard =Postwar= In 1946 Maidstone became mother ship to the 2nd and 7th Submarine Flotillas. The 2nd Flotilla comprised operational boats, the latter a trials and training squadron. Maidstone had a semi-permanent mooring off Monkey Island (Portland) but often put to sea with her brood. In 1951 Maidstone called briefly at Corunna to land a sick crewman. This was not classified an official visit, although it was the first time a British warship had entered a Spanish harbour since the end of the Spanish Civil War. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden On 16 June 1955 the submarine sank in Portland harbour alongside Maidstone 20 minutes after an explosion in the forward torpedo compartment. A rescue party from Maidstone saved a number of the Sidons crew, but 13 died. A week later, the submarine was raised and the accident was found to be caused by the high-test peroxide fuel in a torpedo. Surgeon Lieutenant Charles Rhodes was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal for his part in the rescue. In 1956 Maidstone was the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. In September 1957, the Soviet Union protested when Maidstone accompanied the training aircraft carrier on a visit to Helsinki. In 1959 Maidstone received an extensive refit to accommodate nuclear submarines and the 2nd Flotilla was then moved to Devonport. In 1961 Maidstone sailed to Faslane, on Gareloch, where she was the depot ship to the 3rd and 10th Submarine Squadrons. In 1965 she undertook a trip to Liverpool, and she visited the same port one year later. She also undertook a trip to Rothesay during this period and then in 1968 she sailed to Rosyth Dockyard to undertake preparations to \\"mothball\\" her.

In 1969 she arrived under tow at Belfast to serve as barracks for the increased security forces in the area. In 1971, she was used as a prison ship in Operation Demetrius as a place to hold internees without trial, including Gerry Adams. The holding area itself was at the stern and consisted of two bunkhouses, one up, one down, and two messrooms. Above these were the rooms of the governor and his staff (previously the captain's cabin) and above this was the deck, used twice a day for exercise. The deck was surrounded by -high barbed wire. She was moored in Belfast harbour from the land, entry to the jetty being guarded by sand-bagged army emplacements.HMS Maidstone, Uboat.net Maidstone was also notable for a successful escape by seven Provisional IRA members on 17January 1972.

He was born in Helsinki and died in Jokioinen. He had four children and was the grandfather of Peter Fazer. His father, Eduard Peter Fazer (originally Fatzer), was a Swiss-born furrier. Fazer studied baking in Berlin, Paris, and Saint Petersburg before becoming a pioneer of Finnish confectionery. Together with his wife Berta he opened a French-Russian confectionery at Glogatan (Kluuvikatu) 3 in Helsinki on 17 September 1891. Later he opened a chocolate and candy factory in Punavuori. Fazer, the company he founded, is still in existence. Many of its products have become classic. This is particularly true of the \\"Fazer Blue\\" (\\"Fazerin Sininen\\" in Finnish, \\"Fazer bl√•\\" in Swedish), a brand of chocolate that is often compared to salmiakki, as a candy that is a part of the Finnish national identity. The (Swiss) recipe for the Fazer Blue was received into the family as a gratitude to Karl Fazer's son Sven Fazer for taking care of a sick boy. The same recipe has been in use ever since 1922, when the chocolate was introduced to the market in its characteristic blue packaging. Karl Fazer was a nature lover, birdwatcher, hunter and a fisherman. He founded many natural parks in Finland. 1912 Olympics He was also an excellent marksman, and he participated the Olympic Games in 1912 with the Finnish shooting team.

It was designed as a lower-cost replacement for the Austin Champ, to compete directly with Rover's Land Rover. Like the Land Rover, it was aimed at both the civilian and military markets. History Post-war, the FV1800 Nuffield Mudlark, later to become the FV1801 Austin Champ, had been designed as the first of the new CT series of soft-skin military vehicles for the British Army. The Mudlark used the new Rolls-Royce B40 engine, all-independent suspension based on Tracta joints and a 24V electrical system with a two-speed high-capacity generator capable of powering a FFW version. Despite these technical features, the resultant vehicle was not popular or successful, being seen as over-complicated, and a maintenance and repair nightmare. The Champ was also expensive, compared to simpler vehicles. The later Gipsy was a reaction to both the failure of the Champ, and the success of the Land Rover. Both the Champ and the Gipsy were significantly different from the American Jeep, the Gipsy being much closer in design, appearance and price to the Land Rover. Unlike the Land Rover, the Gipsy's bodywork was steel. The suspension was sophisticated, independent suspension all round using \\"Flexitor\\" rubber springs developed by Alex Moulton, giving the Gipsy the ability to travel at high speeds over rough terrain. In due course, later models offered leaf springs as an option on the front and rear. It used a BMC 2199 cc petrol engine based on the one in the Austin A70; the compression ratio was 6.8:1, making the petrol-powered vehicle tolerant of low octane fuel. A 2178 cc diesel-engined version was also offered. The Gipsy was first available with a 90-inch (2286 mm) short wheelbase (SWB). A 111-inch (2819 mm) long wheelbase (LWB) version became available from Series II. When BMC merged with Leyland to form British Leyland, the Austin Gipsy and the Land Rover were being produced by the same company. Production of the Gipsy was stopped after some 21,208 vehicles had been sold. The Austin Gipsy was assembled from CKD packs in New Zealand at the Austin distributor's Petone factory which was directly opposite Todd Motor's assembly plant for Rootes Group and Chrysler Australia's products. Austin Maxis were later assembled in the same factory.

Hainhofer studied Law at the Universities of Siena and Padua, traveled through Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, and acquired a good knowledge of art and several languages. He was elected to the senate of Augsburg in 1605 and was chosen as political correspondent in the city by the King of France, the Margrave of Baden and Duke Philip II of Pomerania. he last of these was of particular significance and Hainhofer acted as agent for the Duke in acquiring art and objects for a Kunstkammer (curiosity chamber), and in composing the famous so-called Pommerscher Kunstschrank (Pomeranian curiosity cabinet), which was made 1615-1617 and given as a gift to the Duke; it was destroyed in a fire during Berlin bombing campaign at the end of World War II. He is also known for building the first cuckoo clock in Black Forest, Germany. Philip of Pomerania and other princes used Hainhofer for various diplomatic missions and the contacts Hainhofer made on his journeys also served to develop his business as an art agent, and he produced additional curiosity cabinets. In 1632, one was presented by Hainhofer on behalf of the City of Augsburg to King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. This cabinet, which is the best preserved of Hainhofer's Kunstschr√§nke, is on display in the Museum Gustavianum of the University of Uppsala. Another one, made for Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, is preserved in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

The union works in the areas of vegetarianism, nutrition, health, consumer protection, the campaign for animal rights, ecology, general information and against world hunger. Headquarters are in Winterthur (Switzerland), together with the Swiss organisation Swissveg.  History  * The EVU distribute the 1995 film Devour the Earth about the global consequences of meat consumption. The film was produced by the Vegetarian Society, written by Tony Wardle and narrated by Paul McCartney. * In October 2011, Renato Pichler, President of the EVU, reported that the French government's D√©cret 2011-1227 and associated Arr√™t√© (September 30, 2011) effectively outlaws the serving of vegan meals at any public or private school in France. Similar decrees are proposed for kindergartens, hospitals, prisons and retirement homes.Renato Pichler \\"The French Government Outlaws Vegetarianism in Schools\\" , European Vegetarian Union (EVU). *Also see \\"The French Government Outlaws Vegetarianism in Schools\\", European Vegetarian and Animal News Alliance (EVANA).  Purpose  The main activities of the EVU are: * To support and represent member societies on a European level, and to offer a platform for close cooperation; * To raise public awareness of, and promote vegetarianism, vegetarian issues and the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle; * To lobby governments, European institutions and organisations for greater recognition of vegetarian issues in policy decisions; and * To further promote the successful V-label scheme (Universal Vegetarian Symbol), in the interest of all vegetarian and vegan consumers across Europe and the rest of the world. The V-Label is a standardised European vegetarian label from the EVU with the aim of easy identification of vegetarian products and services.  Labeling Issues  As the demand for vegan and vegetarian products in Europe has continued to rise, the European Vegetarian Union has tried to define how to label \\"vegetarian\\" and \\"vegan\\" items. They have argued that the vegan label on a product should have a clear and standard meaning. They have put forth 2 main requirements: # \\"The deliberate use of non-vegan or non-vegetarian substances must be ruled out.\\" # \\"The (potential) presence of inadvertent traces of non-vegan or non- vegetarian substances should not be an obstacle to labelling a product as vegan or vegetarian, provided that such contamination occurs despite a careful production process that complies with the best practices and the state of the art.\\" Despite the organization's efforts, the European Commission initially refused to enact any changes. The EVU has continued to lobby state governments, especially in Germany because the country experienced more widespread support for the labeling legislation. As a result, \\"consumer protection ministers of German L√§nder unanimously agreed on a proposal for a wording of the definition of the terms ‚Äúvegan‚Äù and ‚Äúvegetarian‚Äù for food labelling and put it into effect for the food control authorities within their jurisdictions, making it de facto binding.\\" A recent 2018 report predicts that \\"vegan\\" and \\"vegetarian\\" labels will be required to meet the EVU's criteria by the year 2020.

Murder  On November 13, 2002, Stachowicz attended Mass at the Basilica of St. Hyacinth in the Chicago neighborhood of Avondale before beginning a favor as a Polish‚ÄìEnglish translator at the Sikorski Funeral Home, where Gutierrez worked as a janitor. Nineteen-year-old Gutierrez tipped police off when he speculated he thought someone had killed her and stuffed her body in the building's crawlspace. He was working at the funeral parlor and had recently been laid off and was being evicted. Area 5 Cmdr. Lee Epplen of the Chicago Police stated that Stachowicz and Gutierrez got into an argument after the woman tried to persuade him to change his lifestyle, police and prosecutors said. Gutierrez told police he became enraged after Stachowicz questioned him, said Cook County Assistant State's Atty. Nancy Galassini during a bond hearing. Gutierrez claimed that she proceeded to ask him \\"Why do you sleep with boys?\\", after which he became even more angry and Nancy Galassini said \\"The defendant punched and kicked and stabbed the victim until he was tired. He then placed a plastic garbage bag over her head and strangled her.\\" He then continued to rape her. Gutierrez later concealed her body in a crawlspace under the floor. Prosecutors also accused Gutierrez of sexually assaulting Stachowicz, a charge that was denied by his defense attorney. In a confession videotaped by the Chicago Police, Gutierrez said he panicked because Stachowicz's trying to get him to change his sexuality reminded him of his mother. \\"She had this sneer, which reminded me of my mother when she used to beat me...I saw nothing but red,\\" Gutierrez was reported saying in the Chicago Sun-Times. Later his defense attorney, Crystal Marchigiani, said that it was Gutierrez who had been physically attacked by Stachowicz, and that, \\"She could not leave him alone.\\" Gutierrez was sentenced to life in prison on July 2, 2007. His defense attorney asked the judge to account for his childhood history of physical abuse, but Stachowicz' son was 100% convinced that Gutierrez should receive the death penalty. Aftermath Stachowicz' murder is the focus of some attention by conservatives, who regard it an unrecognized hate crime. Groups such as Concerned Women for America have complained about the comparative lack of media attention given to the case which they believe meets the definition of a hate crime against Christians and heterosexuals. Conservative writer Rod Dreher has written about her death, arguing that it should receive the same level of media attention as the death of Matthew Shepard. Catholic Bishop Thomas J. Paprocki, an auxiliary bishop of Chicago who knew Stachowicz personally, called her a \\"martyr for the faith\\". On the fifth anniversary of her death, Catholic journalist Phil Lawler called for the opening of a formal beatification process.

Plot =Book One: Friend or Foe?= On Jack Armstrong's birthday, he received a laptop computer from his parents, British residents working on a US military base. They have been having financial problems so he is grateful for the gift. He explores it with his friend Lothar Gelt (nicknamed Loaf) and their acquaintance Merle Stone, where they discover it is a piece of alien technology. Once turned on, it enables them to communicate with a stray dog around the base named \\"Bitz\\", who tells them he is actually code-named Sirius (a pun on the \\"Dog Star\\" of the same name). He and Merle's apparent cat (named Googie, code-name Vega), are both members of the \\"Friends\\", a group dedicated to resistance of The Tyrant, who leads the FOEs (Forces of Evil). Specifically, they are shape-shifters who have become permanently trapped in these Earth creature forms. They explain how The Tyrant has captured all of the servers in the Galaxy except for the one that Sirius and his companion Janus brought to Earth and disguised as the computer. The Server's \\"Help\\" program, which activates whenever its name is said, is sardonic and fails to live up to its name. Jack receives further proof of the truth of these odd revelations when he is teleported (called t-mailed) to meet Janus on another planet (teleportation through \\"N-Space\\" enables the characters to travel faster-than-light). Loaf exploits this and gallavants around the Galaxy (it is always capitalised in the series) irresponsibly enough for the FOEs to imprison some of the Earth resistance. Janus rescues them, but a Bug (an extraterrestrial resembling a rhinoceros, in The Tyrant's employ) follows them to Earth when Tracer, The Tyrant's right- hand man, sends a \\"western\\" virus into the Server. Merle fends it off with her chess skill and Loaf resists it with an arcade-style simulation, but when Jack is playing Battleship, Bitz leaps onto the keyboard, over-ruling Merle's advice, and hits the wrong button. This allows the Bug to arrive on Earth; however, Janus arrives shortly thereafter. In the battle that ensues, Janus and the Bug both fall into N-Space, presumably dead, Janus sacrificing himself for the Server's safety. A message to them sent on time-delay reveals them they can either remain safe on Earth for Friends agents to find them, or search for the enigmatic Weaver, founder of the Outernet. =Book Two: Control= With his personal agenda foremost, Loaf cons Jack into giving him The Server in an attempt to make money, which requires him to take out a loan from aliens. His greed causes the seemingly impregnable Chain protecting Earth from the FOEs to be broken, so the Tyrant sends another of the Bugs to get The Server back. As a result, Jack and his friends are stranded on Deadrock, a dangerous planet, crawling with FOEs, and Loaf runs into several representatives of the nastiest loan sharks in the Galaxy. Loaf owes them money and they'd like a word with him. Back on Earth, the Bug poses as an agent of the US government and gains control of Merle's father, Colonel Stone, commander of a USAF base in England. Jack and Merle find allies- but the Deadrock Freedom Fighters face terrible odds, and all they have on their side are primitive weapons and the cranky Help application. As revolution rages on Deadrock, Jack and his Friends return to Earth in an attempt to rescue Colonel Stone and keep The Server from the FOEs. They eventually destroy the Deadrock Server, which FOEs had set up to monitor all information passed through it electronically (speech was forbidden) and reintroduce the residents to talking. At the end, Janus contacts them from N-space and directs them to the planet Helios to meet Tiresias, the \\"sightless one who sees all things\\" (a reference to the Greek myth of Tiresias). =Book Three: Odyssey= Following Janus's instructions, Jack, Merle, Loaf, Bitz, and Googie attempt to teleport to Helios. However, they are intercepted and detained on a planet populated by spiders. Each time they attempt to leave, they are returned to their original location and time, with no memory of their original arrival. Eventually the Help program is able to break the vicious circle. This leads them to Googie's home planet, Kippo VI. She is arrested as a traitor, but the humans find themselves able to shapeshift due to parasitic natives of the planet that endow all residents or visitors with the ability. They fight off FOE attacks, helped by Loaf, who is being controlled by a chip that Tracer implanted in him. Unable to teleport to Helios, they look for affordable spaceship transportation and find it in the form of hippie Zodiac Hobo and his anonymous ship, which complains about its status as such until Merle names it Trigger. They arrive safely and are accosted by the Collectors of Helios, a parody of Earth monks. They are led to the Sightless One, who promises to input the Weaver's coordinates if he is given the Server. He is revealed as Tracer, however. It's not long before the Friends find the true Tiresias, a monstrous life-form bound to a computer that collects knowledge but can do nothing with it. After meeting Janus in N-space (he removes Loaf from Tracer's control), they serve as eyes for Tiresias, letting him see the universe before dying in peace. Odyssey allusions As the title might indicate, the third book of the series contains several allusions to the Odyssey of Homer. When Jack sees one-eyed extraterrestrial guards, he is reminded of Cyclops, and suggests disguising themselves, as Odysseus and his crew disguised themselves by hiding under sheep. This is successful, and Jack and his friends eventually escape on Trigger. Once in space, they hear a message claiming to be from a woman named Molpe, a refugee from the fictional planet of \\"Ligeia\\". After some debate, Jack orders the refugees' rescue, only to find that the humanoids have metamorphosed into dangerous asteroids. After escaping them, Trigger lands on what appears to be an asteroid. One of the characters, however, identifies it as a silla, a creature that traps spaceships. Trigger escapes this threat as well, only to fall into a black hole that parallels the mythological Charybdis. In the first chapter of the book, the protagonists are involuntarily teleported to a planet occupied by arachnid extraterrestrials (and, indeed, named \\"Arachnius III\\"). A \\"reverse Chain\\" of teleportation allows them to be repeatedly teleported from the teleportation station where they arrive back to that same station, with no memory of the previous times they've arrived there. The Arachnians analyse the protagonists' saliva to produce food perfectly catered to their tastes: both of these facets allude to the mythological Lotophagi. At the end of the book, they are indeed successful in meeting Tiresias. =Book Four: Time Out= Jack, Merle, Loaf and their companions Googie and Bitz travel back in time to Vered II, homeworld of tree- dwelling computer genius Selenity Dreeb, a member of a group of computer fanatics called the Weavers. Merle attempts to return to her own time, but winds up in an alternate universe in which the Outernet was never created: Tracer is invading Earth, and she is a rebel on the opposite side of the war from Jack. Lothar, Loaf's alternative self, tells her that the alternate version of her was killed but that they had had a relationship. She brings him back with her to Selenity's time, where Jack gives Selenity the information needed to start the Outernet. A jealous Loaf leaves the alternate Lothar behind when they try to return to Earth, but in that timeline Janus and Sirius/Bitz were captured by FOEs on Vered. They go to a recent version of Vered and wind up having to create three copies of themselves to allow Janus and Sirius to escape. It is revealed that Help was previously helpful, but months of being carried across the countryside by Bitz corrupted his memory. When they return to Earth, the time-traveling capability is disabled. =Book Five: The Hunt= The Tyrant has retired the Bugs for their repeated failures and recruited Bounty Hunters, the ruthless, self-serving scum of the universe. Their task is to hunt down The Server along with Jack and his Friends. Mad Moxie, the Thing With No Name and Tingkat Bumbag (the most feared Hunter in the Galaxy) are bad enough, but when The Tyrant's renegade ex-Communications Chief and Zodiac Hobo, space adventurer extraordinaire (not forgetting Zodiac's ship Trigger) lend a hand (or in Tracer's case, six hands), things get seriously out of hand. What follows is a roller-coaster ride around the Earth as Jack and his companions try to stay one step ahead of the Bounty Hunters and activate the planet's ancient defences against alien invasion. They use a low-tech form of teleportation, travelling to Stonehenge (where Janus and Sirius originally landed), the Great Pyramid of Giza, Machu Picchu, Uluru, and Shangri-La to complete a chain that will defend Earth. The Tyrant, however, takes advantage of their absence to capture Jack's parents. =Book Six: Weaver= Jack and his companions have foiled The Tyrant, leader of the FOEs and Most Evil Being in the Galaxy, time after time. However, the Tyrant has kidnapped Jack's parents. And now Merle, Loaf, Googie and Bitz have to help Jack take the fight to the Dread Lord himself, to the depths of the Dark Pyramid. The final struggle to save The Server, and with it the Outernet, the Pan-Galactic Web itself, is about to begin. Janus gives Help access to a startling secret: the Bugs, believed to be genetically engineered, were in fact a thriving species before The Tyrant annihilated all but one and cloned it. With this knowledge, the Bugs willingly come to Jack's side for the showdown. The Tyrant is revealed to be Lothar, who grew bitter on Vered. The Weaver turns out to be Tracer, who has contained Selenity's consciousness as well through a mind-meld. The Tyrant disappears into N-Space, and Tracer/Selenity/Weaver is physically killed but able to survive consciously through the Outernet. Jack takes on the title of Weaver but Loaf and Merle move to the U. S., promising to keep in touch with Jack through the Outernet.

The duo competed in many promotions, including Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). They won the World Tag Team Championships in each company except WWF. Their name was taken from a black and white gangster film, and prior to becoming a team, Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge had a long-standing feud on the independent circuit. In addition, the two wrestled each other under their former ring names the Cheetah Kid and Johnny Rotten in a dark match at the first TV tapings for WWF Monday Night Raw on January 11, 1993, eight months before they would debut as a tag team in ECW. In September 2002, Rocco Rock died after a heart attack. Johnny Grunge died in February 2006 from sleep apnea complications. History =Eastern / Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1996)= The Public Enemy made their ECW debut in September 1993 at UltraClash, as booker Paul Heyman gave them the gimmick of white guys who embraced and loved the growing hip hop culture of America. Heyman has stated that he got the inspiration to create The Public Enemy from a Newsweek article about the cultural changes occurring in America and the difficulty for young men living in places like Los Angeles during the early 1990s, with a quote that stated \\"The generation of today is more afraid of living than dying\\". The team quickly became one of the more popular acts in the company; their wild brawling style, complete with a myriad of foreign objects and the inclusion of tables, made them one of the most feared teams in the company and it wasn't long before they won their first ECW Tag Team Championship. They regularly danced their way to the ring, waving their arms to the their theme song (Ini Kamoze's \\"Here Comes The Hotstepper\\") and inviting fans into the ring for impromptu dance parties after won matches. As The Public Enemy was embraced by the majority of fans, Heyman was inspired to bring in The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed, from Smoky Mountain Wrestling) at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams to feud with TPE. The Gangstas immediately began a long and bloody feud with The Public Enemy, which pitted The Gangstas' \\"harsh, gritty West Coast gangsta\\" lifestyle against The Public Enemy's \\"East Coast feel good\\" style. Their feud is among the feuds most often cited as \\"classic ECW\\". Memorable moments The Public Enemy was also involved in some of ECW's most memorable moments. On one occasion, during a singles match between Cactus Jack and Terry Funk at Hardcore Heaven 1994, the Public Enemy interfered and attacked both wrestlers. Terry Funk turned to the crowd and asked the fans if he could have a chair to use. A fan immediately threw a chair into the ring, and not long after many other fans followed suit. Eventually the ring was filled with chairs with both members of The Public Enemy buried underneath. In another incident in Tampa, Florida, towards the end of their run with ECW, during the Sunshine State Slaughter event in 1995, The Public Enemy asked the fans to come into the ring to dance with them one last time. As more and more fans piled in and onto the ring, all dancing and celebrating, the ring actually collapsed. At ECW's House Party 1999 on January 16, The Public Enemy made a long-awaited and much-hyped return to the ECW Arena, in order to answer the challenge of the Dudley Boyz. At the time, they were still under contract to WCW, but they successfully brawled (with assistance from New Jack) with the Dudleys. Following the showdown, Johnny Grunge grabbed the microphone and claimed that the past three years had been a \\"rollercoaster ride\\" for the team, and that \\"if you opened up our chest and looked at our hearts, there's only one thing stamped on it, and that's ECW!\\" Grunge further thanked the Dudleys for house-sitting \\"the house that the Public Enemy built\\" while they were gone, and then invited everyone in attendance to join them in the ring for a post-show celebration. =World Championship Wrestling (1996‚Äì1998)= On November 19, 1995 The Public Enemy received a tryout with the WWF, wrestling a dark match against then WWF Tag-Team Champions The Smokin' Gunns.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm The team would receive an offer to sign with the company, but instead elected to go with a competing overture from World Championship Wrestling. In January 1996, after their success in ECW, The Public Enemy signed on to work for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When they arrived in WCW, they continued acting as they did in the manner that made them so popular with fans. Although the majority of the WCW fanbase was unfamiliar with the ECW product at the time, they still carried tables to the ring. During their three-year stint, they won their only WCW World Tag Team Championship with a victory over Harlem Heat in September 1996, though their reign lasted only eight days. The team wrestled through September 1998 and was mostly victorious in their final year with the company, concluding their run with a win over Villanos IV and V on a Worldwide episode.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw98.htm =Return to ECW, World Wrestling Federation, and return to WCW (1999)= The Public Enemy made a brief return to ECW at the House Party '99 show on January 16, 1999, battling the Dudley Boys to a double countout.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/ecw99.htm Their next scheduled appearance was at Crossing the Line '99 on February 12 in Queens, New York against the Dudleys, which they cancelled due to negotiating with the WWF. The team was buried on the February 20 edition of ECW Hardcore TV as being cowards who ran from a fight. Footage of the Dudleys hitting big moves on the team at an event in Detroit was shown, with a headline stating \\"Breaking News: The Dudleys Destroy Public Enemy.\\" Two days later, the team would make their WWF debut. The Public Enemy signed with the World Wrestling Federation in early 1999. They were not accepted \\"backstage\\" by veteran WWF wrestlers and backstage personnel due to animosity over the fact that The Public Enemy chose WCW over the WWF when the two companies were pursuing the tag team in late 1995. Rocco Rock was also forced to change his name and go by the shortened name \\"Flyboy\\" Rocco, in order not to \\"cause confusion\\" with The Rock. They made their WWF debut on the February 22, 1999, episode of Raw is War, defeating The Brood by disqualification. In the two months they lasted in the WWF, their most notable appearance was losing a squash match against the Acolytes on Sunday Night Heat in Pittsburgh; following a brief feud with APA and The Public Enemy's subsequent release, the APA claimed that they \\"ran The Public Enemy out\\" of the WWF. They said they could do the same to another famous ECW tag team (the Dudley Boyz); after the Dudley Boyz succeeded in the feud, it was commonly referred to as \\"Passing the Acolyte Test\\" since the Dudley Boyz did get over after a feud with the APA while The Public Enemy failed. In 2013, John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield elaborated that much of the animosity was due to them being brought into the company by Terry Taylor, who had his own backstage issues with much of the wrestlers, including the Acolytes. They had also desired to change the planned finish of the squash match, which involved them being driven through tables by the Acolytes. The Acolytes were instructed only to ensure that they go through with the planned finish of the match, leading to the match to be turned into a legitimate shoot, with The Acolytes dominating Public Enemy for the entirety of the four- minute match.http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/110-wrestling- observer-newsletter/29874-feb-25-2013-wrestling-observer-newsletter- elimination-chamber-recap-push-to-get-olympic-wrestling-removal-overturned- wrestlemania-xxx-location-and-new-orleans-history-tons-more Public Enemy would wrestle a final time on March 30, 1999 in a match taped for Shotgun Saturday Night, losing to the Hardy Boys via disqualification.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/99.htm The match was aired on television on April 10, 1999. Shortly after airing, both members of Public Enemy were released in mid-April, along with \\"Dr Death.\\" Steve Williams (who main-evented that same episode), Bart Gunn, and LOD 2000. The Public Enemy briefly returned to WCW after leaving the WWF, with both men involved in the WCW Hardcore Junkyard Invitational. They then made an appearance on the August 4, 1999, episode of WCW Thunder in a squash match loss against Bill Goldberg and again on August 9 in a losing effort against the West Texas Rednecks. Their final appearance came in a house show on August 18, and neither made an appearance in WCW again afterwards. =Later years (1999-2002)= The Public Enemy performing a double team maneuver The Public Enemy made one last appearance on ECW on TNN, which was their last exposure on mainstream television. The tag team made brief appearances on the independent scene after both WCW and ECW folded, appearing in ECW-nostalgia promotion Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW), along with various NWA territories. They also participated in the unaired tapings for the X Wrestling Federation promotion, under the name \\"South Philly Posse\\" and managed by Jasmin St. Claire. In the early 2000s, the Public Enemy performed for the short-lived i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling among other independent promotions. The team won various independent tag team titles. Their last match together was at Intergalactic Wrestling Federation defeating Itch Coma Weidler and The Bouncer in a steel cage match at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, IL on August 12, 2002. Following the death of Rocco Rock in 2002, Grunge teamed with his \\"brother\\" Joey Grunge as The New Public Enemy throughout August 2003. He also made appearances with 3PW, and participated in a memorial segment for deceased ECW wrestlers at Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005. Deaths On September 21, 2002, Ted Petty (\\"Flyboy\\" Rocco Rock) died after suffering a heart attack following a wrestling event. Johnny Grunge had been semi-retired for a few years after the XWF failed to get a TV deal. On February 16, 2006, Mike Durham (Johnny Grunge) died in his home after suffering from complications from sleep apnea. Durham's death was caused by heart disease and obesity, with the medical examiner also citing \\"acute toxicity of carisoprodol and hydrocodone\\" in the autopsy report. Durham evidently died in his sleep at the home of a friend with whom he'd been staying.http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=3014744 Durham's widow has since become an advocate against drug abuse in the wrestling industry since the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide in 2007, when she realized her husband's prescriptions came from the same doctor as Chris Benoit's.

Diop left the band in 1979 to start a solo career, and over the next decade achieved some small success, particularly in partnerships with singer Marie- France Anglade of Black heritage, and jazz saxophonist Yasuaki Shimizu. It was not until the early 1990s that his career began to take off, with the success of his first album, the soundtrack to the film Hyenes (which had been directed by his brother, Djibril Diop Mambety).

Person played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was the 1987 NBA Rookie of the Year. Person played college basketball at Auburn University and was selected fourth overall in the 1986 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers, for whom he played six seasons. He also played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, San Antonio Spurs, Charlotte Hornets and Seattle SuperSonics. His 17-year coaching career ended when Person was ensnared in a college recruitment scandal and pleaded guilty to a bribery charge. High school and college Born in Brantley, Alabama, Person was named after NBA player, MLB player, and actor Chuck Connors. He attended Brantley High School in Brantley, Alabama and played college basketball at Auburn University. He was the most prolific scorer in Auburn basketball history. Person was a four-year letter winner at Auburn from 1982 to 1986, helping the team to Auburn's first three NCAA Tournament appearances (1984‚Äì1986), including a trip to the Elite Eight in 1986. He also helped Auburn win the 1985 SEC Tournament, for which he was named Tournament MVP as Auburn was the first league school to win four tournament games in four days. Person, who played alongside fellow Auburn greats Charles Barkley and Chris Morris, is the all-time scoring leader in Auburn history, with 2,311 points in 126 games for an 18.3 ppg mark, which is sixth all time in school history. He is also the school record-holder for field goals made (1,017) and field goals attempted (1,899) and is third in total rebounds (940). Person was a two-time All-American (1985, 1986), a three-time First Team All-SEC selection and was selected to ESPN's SEC Silver Anniversary Team.

After his first season with the Kings, Person was interviewed for the Chicago Bulls' head-coaching vacancy but ultimately was not hired. Upon leaving Sacramento, Person returned to his home town of Brantley, Alabama in 2008 for an eight-month break after 23 years of playing, administrating, and coaching. =Los Angeles Lakers= He was invited to be Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson's assistant in 2009. In March 2010, he interviewed for the head coaching job for the men's team at his alma mater, Auburn University, but was not successful, despite positive feedback. He returned to his job with the Lakers after the interview. Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni took over from Mike Brown in the middle of the 2012‚Äì13 season, and kept all of Brown's assistants, including Person. However, Person was fired after the season; he was the last remaining member from Jackson's Lakers staff. =Jeonju KCC Egis= In the summer of 2013, Person joined the coaching staff as an associate head coach in South Korea for the Jeonju KCC Egis in the Korean Basketball League.KCC, NBA Ïã†Ïù∏Ïôï Ï∂úÏã† Ï≤ô ÌçºÏä®‚Ä¶Ïô∏Íµ≠Ïù∏ ÏΩîÏπòÎ°ú ÏòÅÏûÖ =Auburn associate head coach= On April 7, 2014, Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl hired Person as an assistant coach.

Person was suspended without pay by Auburn University the day after his arrest and was fired by Auburn University on November 7, 2017. Others were indicted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York on corruption charges around the same time. Person pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit bribery on March 19, 2019; as part of the plea agreement, Person agree to forfeit $91,500. On July 17, 2019, U.S. District Judge Loretta A.

The company was named after the ship Ann and Hope which was lost at sea off Block Island, Rhode Island in 1806. They operated from 1953 to 2001 in the Northeastern United States, and they currently operate a small chain of home fashion outlets, garden outlets, and dollar outlets in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. History =Early years= Ann & Hope was founded by Martin Chase, who was born in 1906 in Kiev, Russian Empire (modern-day Ukraine), and moved with his family to Providence, Rhode Island, at age six. He was the only one of six sons not to work in his father's automobile repair business. Instead, when he was 20, he got a job working at a store called Fintex. After Fintex closed its doors in 1929, Chase worked at Howard's Clothes until 1933. Then he started Chase Clothing, where he undersold other area clothing stores by reducing overhead: for example he did not offer alterations and used inexpensive store fixtures. As World War II approached, the clothing market fell into decline, and Chase began to look for another line of work. In 1946, he purchased the Ann & Hope Mill complex in the village of Lonsdale in Cumberland, Rhode Island. He split the large, empty mill into several small pieces and rented them individually. Some time before December 1953, one of the tenants left the Mill, leaving a large amount of ribbon behind. Rather than dispose of it, the Chases opened the area to the other employees of the Mill and sold the ribbon. Chase then had the idea to reopen a clothing store in the Mill, initially on the third floor. By the following spring, the operation had become large enough that it was relocated to the ground floor. Over time more products were added, and by 1969, Ann & Hope was a $40 million per year operation. =Legacy= Ann & Hope was one of the first self-service department stores, in which customers could look at items without sales personnel, and was also part of the first wave of retail stores in the 1950s to use big basket shopping carts. The original mill location also featured a large parking area, which was not common at the time, as well as a basement level with even more merchandise. A special shopping cart conveyor was operated by staff to move store patrons' items from one floor to the other. Other now-familiar features such as having a central checkout area and a liberal store return policy were also pioneered by Ann & Hope. Ann & Hope also had several features now common to big-box retail facilities. For example, some Ann & Hope stores had full-scale cafeterias. When originally constructed, Ann & Hope stores also had an area that was rented to a sub-tenant, with both in-store and outside entrances, a variation of which is a relatively recent introduction in larger Wal-Mart stores. Many Ann & Hope locations had limited success renting to tenants, and before the chain's closing in 2001, many had been converted to store-run garden shops. Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, visited the Ann & Hope chain in 1961 and got the idea for his store from it, p. 84. and Harry Cunningham visited Ann & Hope in the process of preparing to launch the first Kmart store. =1989 - 2007= Following a slow 1989‚Äì90 holiday season, the Seekonk, Massachusetts store experienced lay-offs, most notably in the home-wares and rug and blind departments. These layoffs were viewed by some as a portent of the difficulties that the Seekonk store (as well as her sister A&H; stores) would experience in a cut-throat regional market throughout the 1990s. All of the Ann & Hope department stores closed in the spring of 2001, except for the two Rhode Island stores: the original location in Cumberland and the store in Warwick. High-value properties that Ann & Hope owned in Massachusetts were sold off. The two locations that remained open were downsized significantly and turned into off-price \\"outlet stores.\\" In the years following the closing, new Ann & Hope‚Äìbranded outlet stores, such as the Ann & Hope Curtain & Bath Outlet, were opened. Several of these new Ann & Hope outlet stores occupied space near where Ann & Hope department stores had previously existed. =2007 - Present= As of 2007, the original Cumberland property is home to an Ann & Hope Curtain and Bath Outlet and an outdoor Garden Outlet. In August 2007, the owners of Ann & Hope made public their intention to convert the Cumberland mill store to a \\"mixed use\\" development of retail and residential space. The Cumberland mill building is now home to the Bargain City Galleria - a thriving flea market, food court and auction center. As of 2010 Ann & Hope Curtain & Bath is still going strong, opening stores in Vernon and Newington, Connecticut. In April and May 2011, Ann & Hope opened two new stores in Raynham and Weymouth, Massachusetts, buying out two Curtain Factory Outlet retailers. This makes a current total of 11 Ann & Hope Outlet Stores: two in Rhode Island, two in Connecticut, and seven in Massachusetts. In May 2013, Ann & Hope continued to grow with its newest Curtain & Bath Outlet location opening in Westborough, MA. After a brief closure early in Spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, several Ann & Hope/Curtain & Bath Outlet Garden Outlets reopened on April 27, 2020. The Curtain & Bath Outlet Facebook page reported: \\"Our garden outlet locations will be OPEN Starting Monday, April 27th! Open daily 8:30am to 5pm! Fully stocked with annuals, perennials, vegetables, herbs, fertilizer, soils, tools, and so much more! Our Cumberland, Warwick, Seekonk & Millis garden outlet locations will be open. Danvers location will open soon. Curtain & Bath outlets will not be open. Please be safe and practice social distancing while shopping.\\" The reopening of outdoor shopping areas - including garden products and patio - was made possible in part by New England governors partially reopening some businesses to the public during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This included Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo's response to constituents who expressed a desire that small garden shops be reopened. Governor Raimondo stated at a press conference on April 18, 2020, \\"I've heard you. I'm hearing you and I want you to know that I directed [the Department of Business Regulation] to work with [the Department of Environmental Management] to address this issue and figure out a safe way for you all to open your businesses.\\" Interior shopping areas remained temporarily closed as of late April 2020. This step was taken in keeping with statewide policies on social distancing, and the designation of critical and non- critical retailers during the pandemic. On June 17, 2020, company officials stated that, despite the closure of three stores in Weymouth, Raynham, and Westborough, Massachusetts, the chain would not be closing all stores. Despite this, it was announced on June 29, 2020 that the company would be closing all remaining outlet stores, with a possibility of keeping select garden center locations open.

However, AGF is mostly known for its football department, which was established in 1902. Currently, the club's first team plays in the Danish Superliga, the top flight of the Danish football league system. AGF has won 5 Danish Football Championships and a record 9 Danish Cups. In 1961, AGF reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup where they were knocked out by later winners, Benfica. In 1989, AGF again reached a European quarter-final. This time in the European Cup Winners' Cup, where they lost 0-1 on aggregate to later winners FC Barcelona.  History  AGF played its first football match against Aarhus Idr√¶tsklub Olympia in November 1902, a 2‚Äì5 loss. Six years later, the club won the Jutland Football Championship by winning 3‚Äì2 over Ringk√∏bing IF in the final. AGF won the Jutland Football Championship seven times and was in three finals of the Danish Football Championship before AGF became a member of the newly founded Denmark Tournament in 1927. In 1911, AGF got its own clubhouse after which the club bought the pitches at Dalgas Avenue. In 1920, AGF began to play its home matches at the newly built Aarhus Stadium, where the club has played ever since. In 1941, the club moved from the clubhouse at Dalgas Avenue to Fredensvang in the suburb of Viby J. For three seasons in a row from 1949‚Äì51 AGF finished in third place in the top division. After spending the 1952‚Äì53 season in the 2. division, AGF returned strongly to the 1. division and in the next 12 seasons won four Danish Football Championships and five Danish Cups. AGF also participated in the first edition of the European Cup, where it lost to French club Stade de Reims. In 1961, AGF reached the quarter-final in the same tournament where it lost to eventual tournament winners Benfica. AGF was relegated to the 2. division in 1968 and in 1973 but returned to the 1. division in 1976. This was the start of 30 years in the top division. The introduction of professional football in Denmark had a big influence on the success AGF experienced from the late 1970s and forward until 1998. With the former Real Madrid star Henning Jensen on the team was AGF close at winning the Danish Football Championship in 1982. AGF played 2‚Äì2 against B 93 in the last game of the season sending the championship to Odense Boldklub. In 1984 AGF was again close to clinching the championship but lost it by a single point to the rivals from Vejle Boldklub. Finally in 1986 AGF won its fifth Danish Football Championship. Flemming Povlsen, Jan Bartram and John Stampe was the profiles in the team. In 1987, 1988 and 1992 AGF also won the Danish Cup. In 1996, with players like Stig T√∏fting and H√•vard Flo, was AGF again close at winning the Danish Football Championship but AGF was overtaken by Br√∏ndby IF in the second last round of the tournament. AGF got revenge by winning the final of the Danish Cup against Br√∏ndby IF in the same season. In 1998, AGF finished third in the Danish Superliga but financial problems resulted in some poor results the following years. In 2000, Peter Rudb√¶k was fired after seven years as manager. From 2000 onwards, the club experienced some of its worst ever results, which led to relegations in the 2005‚Äì06, 2009‚Äì10 and 2013‚Äì14 season. Each time, however, the club secured a quick return to the top-flight. In the summer of 2014, AGF appointed Jacob Nielsen as its new director. Nielsen had been successful as director of Randers where he had managed to secure fine economic results. AGF also hired a new sporting director and Morten Wieghorst as manager. On 6 December 2015, however, Nielsen announced that Wieghorst was fired and that former Danish champion Glen Riddersholm was hired as his replacement. With Glen Riddersholm as manager AGF finished the 2015‚Äì16 season in tenth place having won 3 games, drawn 7, and lost 5 in the remainder of the season. AGF qualified for 2016 cup final losing 2‚Äì1 to FC Copenhagen. In the 2016‚Äì17 season AGF finished 11th after having played relegation play-off matches in the new league structure introduced that season. On 30 September 2017 Riddersholm was fired due to inconsistent results. At that point AGF was 7th in the league having started the 2017‚Äì18 season with 4 wins, 5 defeats, and 2 draws. Riddersholm's last match was a 5‚Äì1 win against FC Helsing√∏r. New manager was David Nielsen who started with 4 consecutive league defeats but finished the season in 7th place after losing a European play-off final against FC Copenhagen 4‚Äì1. After reaching 8th place in 2018‚Äì19 season, the club managed to keep bronze medal in 2019‚Äì20 Stadium Their home ground is Aarhus Stadium, renamed Ceres Park for sponsorship reasons since 2015, which has a capacity of 19,433.

It was launched from Cape Canaveral on a Delta-C1 rocket, on May 25, 1966. It was the second of five Atmosphere Explorers, the first being Explorer 17. Technical specifications Explorer 32 was a stainless steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, in diameter. It carried one ion and two neutral mass spectrometers, three magnetron density gauges, and two electrostatic probes. It used a tape recorder to save data that was acquired when the satellite was not in range of one of the 13 ground stations. It was powered by silver-zinc batteries and a solar cell array. The satellite had an operational life of 10 months. The two neutral mass spectrometers failed a few days after launch, but the remaining instruments operated throughout most of the satellite's lifetime. Explorer 32 suffered a depressurization which led to battery failure, at which point it ceased functioning. Scientific experiments Explorer 32 was designed to directly measure the temperature, composition, density, and pressure of the upper atmosphere. The ion mass spectrometers measured the concentrations of different types of ions in the topside ionosphere, principally atomic hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. The concentrations were recorded as a function of time, location, and solar and geomagnetic activity. The satellite was able to perform a global study of the diurnal variation of the atmosphere during nearly two complete diurnal cycles, since the orbit plane precessed one revolution each 5.5 months. The data from the ion mass spectrometers allowed for studies of: (1) the diurnal and seasonal variation of atmospheric ion composition, (2) the effect of atmospheric winds on the atomic hydrogen-atomic oxygen ion transition level, (3) the density and temporal variation of thermospheric atomic hydrogen, and (4) the altitude variation of ion composition in the midlatitude trough region. The three magnetron density gauges measured the density of the neutral atmosphere as a function of altitude, time, latitude, and solar and geomagnetic activity. The electron temperature and density instrument measure the distribution of electron temperatures and densities using a swept voltage electron probe. The two neutral particle magnetic mass spectrometers were intended to measure the composition of the neutral atmosphere at altitudes between . One spectrometer failed after 4 days, and the other failed after 7 days in orbit. The satellite drag atmospheric density experiment measured the density of the upper atmosphere as a function of altitude, latitude, season, and solar activity. The experiment was possible due to the symmetrical shape of Explorer 32. When the satellite was near perigee, it was observed by networks of ground-based Baker-Nunn cameras, as well as being tracked by radio and radar. Sequences of these observations were used to deduce the density of the atmosphere that the satellite was passing through.

She and Richard Lewontin were jointly awarded the Crafoord Prize for 2015 \\"for their pioneering analyses and fundamental contributions to the understanding of genetic polymorphism\\". Life Ohta graduated from the Agriculture Department of the University of Tokyo in 1956. Shortly after graduating, she was hired at the Kihara Institute for Biological Research where she focused on the cytogenetics of wheat and sugar beets. In 1962 an opportunity provided by Hitoshi Kihara to study abroad in the U.S. became available. While a graduate student at the Graduate School of North Carolina State University, she switched her graduate study focus from plant cytogenetics to population genetics. She then was able to assist her advisor, Ken-Ichi Kojima, in working on problems in stochastic population genetics where they took into account the random changes of allelic frequencies. She obtained her Ph.D. from North Carolina State University in 1966. Because she had studied abroad as a Fulbright student, she was only able to stay in the United States to finish her PhD. Returning to Japan, Ohta worked under Motoo Kimura, who was the only theoretical population geneticist in Japan at the time. After working on the neutral theory of evolution with her mentor Kimura, she became convinced that nearly neutral mutations (neither deleterious nor entirely neutral) played an important role in evolution. She developed the slightly damaging model (Ohta, 1973), then a more general form, the nearly neutral theory of evolution.Steen, TY. 2008 \\"The Case of Ohta Tomoko: A Woman Geneticist in the Neutralist- Selectionist Evolution Controversy.\\" Historia Scientiarum, volume 18(2), pages, 172‚Äì184. She worked at the Japanese National Institute of Genetics from 1969 to 1996, and, in 2002, she was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences as a foreign associate in evolutionary biology. She was married to Yasuo Ohta from 1960 to 1972, and has one child. Reactions to the Nearly Neutral theory When Ohta first published her Nearly Neutral theory, she faced difficulty in attracting the scientific research community's attention. Many researchers at the time strongly supported the natural selection theory. Supporting data in protein evolution was sequentially collected in the 1990s, with even more evidence supporting her theory made available throughout the 21st century. There is more and more evidence evolving that supports her nearly neutral theory of evolution. Some examples include: genetic code and the process that occurs during blood clotting.

It was Shane Douglas's answer to Ric Flair's Four Horsemen. Douglas disliked Flair since he felt that Flair had held him back during his first run in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), when Flair was one of the bookers in WCW at the time.  History  = First incarnation = The original Triple Threat consisted of Shane Douglas, Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko in ECW. At one point they dominated ECW, as Douglas was ECW World Heavyweight Champion, and Benoit and Malenko were ECW World Tag Team Champions. Malenko also became a two-time ECW World Television Champion. The group developed a hand signal ‚Äì the three outer fingers raised with palms facing outward. During the summer of 1995, Douglas left for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), thus disbanding the Triple Threat. However, for a brief time 2 Cold Scorpio was added as a member of the Triple Threat (at least one episode of ECW Hardcore TV had Scorpio, Benoit, and Malenko cutting a promo together stating they were the Triple Threat). Nevertheless, when Benoit and Malenko left for WCW, the Triple Threat ceased to exist until Douglas returned to ECW. During their time in WCW, Benoit and Malenko were both members of the prominent Four Horsemen stable and often teamed together. = Second incarnation = In late 1996, approximately a year after his return to ECW, Douglas reformed the stable with Chris Candido and the man for hire \\"Bulldozer\\" Brian Lee, and Francine as their manager. Douglas held the ECW World Television Championship, but sought to regain the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. In early 1997, a masked man (who displayed the mannerisms of Rick Rude) began stalking Francine. At ECW's first pay-per-view event Barely Legal, the man was revealed to be Brian Lee, who was kicked out of the Triple Threat for betraying Douglas. Bam Bam Bigelow joined the group shortly after when Douglas introduced him as his tag team partner for a match at an event titled \\"Chapter 2\\". Douglas lost the ECW World Television Championship to Tazz, but won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Hardcore Heaven. Rick Rude eventually was persuaded by Shane Douglas to align with the Triple Threat. Rude promoted Chris Candido in his match against Taz at Hardcore Heaven 1997. Rude then began selecting Douglas's opponent to help Douglas become the greatest world champion in ECW. However, this turned out to be a ruse when Rude selected Triple Threat member Bam Bam Bigelow as Douglas's next opponent. Bigelow then challenged Douglas for the title and won, but forfeited his membership in the group in the process. Lance Storm took his place, but it was short-lived,despite being tag team champions, Storm and Candido did not get along thus, Storm was kicked out. In January 1998, Bigelow was re-admitted to the group by helping Douglas defeat Tazz. Taz began a protracted feud with the entire stable, as he wanted a shot at Douglas's world title, but was repeatedly denied and instead being forced to wrestle matches against the other members of The Triple Threat. His frustration led to his creation of the Fuck The World Heavyweight Championship in defiance. Another angle had Candido and Storm winning the ECW World Tag Team Championship together, and were forced to defend it despite their hatred for one another. During their reluctant title defenses, each man tried to one-up the other, and showed more concern for retaining the championship than for their partner's well-being. For a brief time in 1998, once again every member of the group had an ECW title, with Douglas holding the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, Bigelow holding the ECW World Television Championship, and Candido holding one half of the ECW World Tag Team Championship with Triple Threat prospect Lance Storm. The group disbanded completely after Bigelow left for WCW, and Candido and Douglas went their separate ways after Douglas lost the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to Taz at Guilty as Charged.  Later incarnations  = The New Triple Threat (ECW) = In late 1998, Rob Van Dam, Sabu and Taz teamed up to form The New Triple Threat. They wrestled Douglas, Candido and Bigelow at November to Remember on November 1, 1998 and were able to defeat them. The New Triple Threat then disbanded due to inner dissension. = The Revolution (WCW) = In 1999, the three original members again teamed up, joining forces with Perry Saturn and Asya to form the group The Revolution. = Douglas, Candido and Bigelow in WCW = In 2000, Douglas, Candido and Bigelow were briefly reunited in a group together in WCW. Despite not using the name Triple Threat, they imitated the mannerisms of the group. The group was disbanded shortly after, when Candido left WCW. = Triple Threat reunited in XPW = In 2002, the Triple Threat reunited as Douglas, Lizzie Borden and Supreme, and went by the name The Irish Guys and Gals. The three dominated the single's division in Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), with Douglas holding the XPW World Heavyweight Championship and Supreme holding the XPW King of the Deathmatch Championship. Douglas would feud with Candido in XPW until XPW folded in 2003. = Douglas, Candido and Bigelow in JAPW = In 2004, Douglas, Candido and Bigelow reunited at a Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) show just one year before Candido's death in 2005.  Deaths  Three members of the Triple Threat died in a three-year span from 2005‚Äì2007. First on April 28, 2005, Candido would die of a blood clot from foot surgery. Then on January 19, 2007, Bigelow would die of heart disease and an overdose of cocaine and Benzodiazetine.

North of the school and churches, the highway meets the eastern end of its spur into Plymouth and Plymouth State University, NH 175A. NH 175 continues north parallel to the river and I-93 and US 3, which follow the opposite, right bank of the river, into the town of Campton. The highway crosses the Beebe River and parallels the Mad River to its bridge over the river immediately to the south of the highway's junction with NH 49. NH 175 passes through the town of Thornton and its name becomes Eastside Road on entering the town of Woodstock. The highway passes under I-93, has two crossings of the Pemigewasset River, and intersects Tripoli Road, which has a diamond interchange with I-93 immediately to the east. NH 175 has an oblique grade crossing of the Hobo Railroad before crossing the river a third time on a truss bridge and reaching its northern terminus at US 3 (Daniel Webster Highway) just south of the community of North Woodstock.

It is an aquatic plant native to Madagascar, popularly sold for use in aquariums. It is endangered in the wild. Description It is an aquatic monocotyledonous perennial plant with tuberous rhizomes in diameter. The leaves are oblong, the leaf blade 15‚Äì55 cm long and from 5‚Äì16 cm broad, with a total leaf length including the petiole of up to . The leaves spread horizontally beneath the surface of the water, and are little more than a lattice-like skeletal network of veins with no tissue between. The flowers are produced on an erect spike up to long, protruding up to above the water surface. There seem to be several forms of this plant in cultivation, some large, some much smaller.Bruggen, H.

Interpret Publishing, United States and Canada . A. madagascariensis is often regarded as a difficult plant to cultivate. This is due to several factors: 1) it needs bright indoor light to thrive; this encourages the growth of algae on the lattice-like leaves; which is difficult to remove; 2) newly imported bulbs grow well in their first year, but often fail in their second year, apparently due to a lack of food storage in the bulbs (cause still unknown); 3) seeds may be produced, but often fail to germinate or thrive. Some enthusiasts recommend strong water movement and a high filtration rate for this plant.

Mauer (September 4, 1901 ‚Äì December 20, 1978) was an American college basketball, baseball and football coach and multi-sport college athlete. During the course of his 36-year collegiate coaching career, Mauer was the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky, Miami University (Ohio), the University of Tennessee, the U.S. Military Academy, and the University of Florida. John was the head coach of the Tennessee baseball team. John also served as the defensive backs coach for Tennessee under head coach General Robert Neyland. After coaching his college coaching career, John worked under Vince Lombardi scouting players for the Green Bay Packers. Mauer also scouted for the San Francisco 49ers, Atlanta Falcons, and New York Giants.  Early life and education  Mauer was born in 1901 at Aurora, Illinois. Both of his parents died by the time he was 13 years old, and he was raised by his older sister. With the financial assistance of a local businessman, he attended Batavia High School in Batavia, Illinois and was able to enroll in college. Mauer attended the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois from 1922 to 1926, where he played for the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. As a player, he was remembered for being one of the pioneers of one-handed shooting. While attending Illinois, his roommate was Illini football great Harold E. \\"Red\\" Grange. Mauer was named Outstanding Athlete and Scholar in the Big Ten Conference as a senior, and graduated from Illinois with a bachelor's degree in 1926.  Coaching career  Mauer was the head coach in football, basketball, and track at Batavia High School, from 1926 to 1927, after which he was the head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team of the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky from 1927 to 1930, immediately preceding the legendary Adolph Rupp. Mauer's successful Wildcats teams were known as the \\"Mauer men,\\" and he was one of the first coaches to popularize the bounce pass as an element of basketball offense. His Wildcats teams posted an overall win-loss record of 40‚Äì14 (.741) in three seasons. After leaving Kentucky, he became the head coach of the Miami Redskins men's basketball team of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, coaching the Redskins (now known as the \\"RedHawks\\") for eight seasons from 1930 to 1938. Mauer did not have a winning record in his first five seasons with the Redskins, but posted winning records in two of his final three seasons. During the 1937‚Äì1938 season, the Redskins finished 11‚Äì5. At Miami, he coached Walter \\"Smoky\\" Alston who would go on manage the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished his Miami career with an overall record of 46‚Äì80 (.365), leaving Oxford after the 1937‚Äì1938 season, and was replaced by Weeb Ewbank.miami 2006 basketball media guide Mauer became the head coach for the Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, for eight seasons between 1938 and 1947.Mauer's tenure at Tennessee was interrupted for a single season by World War II in 1943‚Äì1944. Mauer's Volunteers had significant success, posting an overall record of 127‚Äì41 (.756), and winning two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1941, 1943) and two SEC tournaments (1941, 1943). In 1945, John led the team to the Quarterfinals in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). At the time, the National Invitation Tournament was more prestigious than the NCAA Basketball Tournament. During his time as the Volunteers' head basketball coach, he also worked as the head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers baseball team from 1938 to 1942, and as an assistant football coach for the Tennessee Volunteers football team under head coaches Neyland and John Barnhill from 1938 to 1946. Mauer later served as the head coach for the Army Black Knights men's basketball team of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, for four seasons from 1947 to 1951,Associated Press, \\" Mauer Leaves West Point Post,\\" The New York Times, p. S48 (April 11, 1951). Retrieved June 26, 2010. and the Florida Gators men's basketball team of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, for nine seasons from 1951 to 1960. His four Army Cadets teams finished 33‚Äì35 (.485); his nine Gators teams compiled a record of 98‚Äì102 (.490). While coaching the Gators basketball team, he also served as an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team under head coaches Bob Woodruff and Ray Graves. After his final season as the Gators' basketball mentor, Mauer returned to the University of Tennessee and worked as an assistant coach for the Volunteers football team from 1960 to 1963 under head coaches Bowden Wyatt and Jim McDonald.  Legacy  Mauer died in Knoxville on December 20, 1978; he was 77 years old. He was survived by his wife Grace, their two sons, and their five grandchildren. Mauer was the first, and to date the only, person to serve as the head coach in the same sport at three different SEC universities. His winning percentage as the Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball head coach remains the best of the modern era; his winning percentage as the Kentucky Wildcats' head is still among the program's six best of the modern era. Mauer was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.

Overview The night market encompasses two distinct sections sharing a symbiotic relationship: a section formerly housed in the old Shilin Market building, containing mostly food vendors and small restaurants; and the surrounding businesses and shops selling other nonfood items. The food court holds 539 stalls, and the second floor serves as a parking lot for 400 cars. In addition to the food court, side streets and alleys are lined with storefronts and roadside stands. Cinemas, video arcades, and karaoke bars are also prevalent in the area. Like most night markets in Taiwan, the local businesses and vendors begin opening around 16:00. As students begin returning home from school, crowds reach their peak between 20:00 and 23:00. Businesses continue operating well past midnight, closing around 01:00 or 02:00. Tourist traffic has increased in recent years due to the opening of the Taipei Metro system. The night market is closest to Jiantan Station on Tamsui‚ÄìXinyi line (Tamsui/Red Line), and can be seen from the station platform. Historical development The night market is located near the former location of a wharf on the Keelung River. Agricultural produce from farms in Shilin being shipped to other ports such as Banka and Dadaocheng would typically be sold in this area. The daytime Shilin Market was formally established in this area in 1909, and the market was inaugurated in 1913. With the influx of customers, many new businesses and food vendors began to establish themselves in the area and the Shilin Night Market was born. The most prominent landmark inside the night market is the centuries-old Mazu Temple, known as , which was first established in 1796 and moved to current location in 1864. Shilin Night Market has since become the largest and most well-known night market in Taiwan, especially with regards to food, and is a favorite focal point for Taipei's night life among residents and visitors alike. Due to safety, sanitation and fire hazard concerns, the old Shilin Market structure was demolished in October 2002 by the Taipei City Government; the food vendors formerly based within the old structure were relocated to a newer temporary structure a few hundred meters away, next to the metro Jiantan Station. Plans for the renovated site began in 1999. Work commenced in 2006 after the relocation of the vendors to the temporary site. The renovated site re-opened in 2011. Transportation Shilin Night Market is accessible via the Tamsui‚ÄìXinyi line (Taipei Metro) at Jiantan Station. A number of bus routes also serve the area with stops at Jiantan Station, nearby Ming Chuan University, and Xiao Bei (Hsiao Pei) Street.

In some cases, as with the Brahmins of Vedic India and the Kohanim and Levites of ancient Israel, the caste was a hereditary one, with a person's position as a priest depending on his biological descent. Zoroastrianism also has a hereditary priesthood, as does Alevism, Yezidism and Yarsanism. In Sufism, the spiritual guide is also often a hereditary leader, while the Sayyids of India, who claim descent from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, have been described as a priestly caste. In the Russian Eastern Orthodox Church, the clergy, over time, formed a hereditary caste of priests. Marrying outside of these priestly families was strictly forbidden; indeed, some bishops did not even tolerate their clergy marrying outside of the priestly families of their diocese.The Russian Clergy (Translated from the French of Father Gagarin, S.J.), C.

History Arsinoe was the capital of the Heroopolite nome, and one of the principal harbors belonging to Egypt. It appears to have been also denominated Cleopatris (Strabo p. 780) and Arsinoites (Plin. v. 9. ¬ß 9; Orelli, Inscr. 516). It is also conjectured to have stood on the site of the biblical Pi-hahiroth (Pihachiroth). Exodus ; Numbers ; Winer, Biblioth. Realw√∂rterb. ii. p. 309\\\\. The modern Ardscher√∫d, a village near Suez, corresponds to this Arsinoe. It was seated near the eastern termination of the Royal canal, which communicated with the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, and which Ptolemy Philadelphus carried on from the Bitter Lakes to the head of the Heroopolite gulf. Arsinoe (Plin. v. 12) was ca. 200 km from Pelusium. The revenues of the Arsinoite nome were presented by that monarch to his wife (who was also his sister), Arsinoe II of Egypt, after whom the city was named, and remained the property of successive queens or princesses of the Lagid family. The shortness of the road across the eastern desert and its position near the canal were the principal advantages of Arsinoe as a staple of trade. But although it possessed a capacious bay, it was exposed to the south wind, and the difficulties which ships encountered from reefs in working up the gulf were considerable. Arsinoe, accordingly, was less eligibly situated for the Indian traffic than either Myos Hormos or Berenice. In common, however, with other ports on the Red Sea Arsinoe improved in its commerce after the conquest of Egypt by the Romans. One hundred and twenty vessels annually sailed from Egyptian havens to bring from western India silk, precious stones, and aromatics (Gibbon, D. and F. ch. vi). During the reign of Trajan, the city's fortunes declined with the development of a new canal between the Nile and the Red Sea terminating at Clysma a few km to the west of Arsinoe.  In popular culture  Arsinoe is depicted in the first DLC (The Hidden Ones) of the 2017 video game Assassin's Creed Origins. It is shown as a town occupied by Romans, who tear down ancient Egyptian monuments for use as building materials in 38 BC.

They are typically defined by either their designated members' often superficial similarity to each other, or their lack of one or more distinct character states or by their not belonging to one or more other taxa. Wastebasket taxa are by definition either paraphyletic or polyphyletic, and are therefore not considered to be valid taxa under strict cladistic rules of taxonomy. The name of a wastebasket taxon may in some cases be retained as the designation of an evolutionary grade, however. Examples * The familiar category of invertebrates is an \\"everything-else\\" category, comprising all animals without backbones. * The snake family Colubridae as traditionally defined is not a natural group. * Flacourtiaceae: a now defunct family of flowering plants ‚Äì the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has placed tribes and genera in various other families, especially the Achariaceae and Salicaceae. * The obsolete kingdom Protista is composed of all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants or fungi, leaving to the protists all single-celled eukaryotes. * Tricholomataceae is a fungal group, at one point composed of the white-, yellow-, or pink-spored genera in the Agaricales not already classified as belonging to the Amanitaceae, Lepiotaceae, Hygrophoraceae, Pluteaceae, or Entolomataceae. * Carnosauria and Thecodontia are fossil groups, banded together back when the limited fossil record did not allow for a more detailed scheme. * Condylarthra is an artificial clade into which ungulate mammals not clearly within Perissodactyla or Cetartiodactyla were traditionally shoved. Many of these groups, like Meridiungulata or Protungulatum, may not represent laurasithere mammals, while others like phenacodontids have been clearly established as early odd-toed ungulates. * The order Insectivora has traditionally been used as a dumping ground for placental insectivorous mammals (and similar forms, such as colugos), usually aligned with carnivorans, ungulates and bats. While the core components (moles, shrews, hedgehogs and close relations) do in fact form a consistent clade, Eulipotyphla, that is part of Laurasiatheria with the aforementioned clades, other mammals historically placed in the order have been found to belong to other branches of the placental tree: tree shrews and colugos are euarchontans related to Primates and sometimes grouped in Sundatheria, while tenrecs, golden moles and elephant shrews are all afrotheres, probably forming the clade Afroinsectiphilia. Both of these clades have at times been accused of being wastebasket taxa themselves, grouping superficially similar animals in Euarchonta and Afrotheria respectively, but they have been more strongly supported by genetic studies. * Vermes is an obsolete taxon of worm-like animals. It was a catch-all used by Carl Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for non-arthropod invertebrate animals. * The traditional circumscription of Senecio is artificial and is polyphyletic, even in its new circumscription which is based on genetic data. As no morphological synapomorphies are known to determine which species belong to the genus or not, no exact species number is known. Wastebasket taxa in science Fossil groups that are poorly known due to fragmentary remains are sometimes grouped together on gross morphology or stratigraphy, only later to be found to be wastebasket taxa, such as the crocodile-like Triassic group Rauisuchia. One of the roles of taxonomists is to identify wastebasket taxa and reclassify the content into more natural units. Sometimes, during taxonomic revisions, the wastebasket taxa can be salvaged after doing thorough research on its members, and then imposing tighter restrictions on what continues to be included. Such techniques \\"saved\\" Carnosauria and Megalosaurus. Other times, the taxonomic name contains too much unrelated \\"baggage\\" to be successfully salvaged. As such, it is usually dumped in favour of a new, more restrictive name (for example, Rhynchocephalia), or abandoned altogether (for example, Simia). Related concepts A related concept is that of form taxon, \\"wastebasket\\" groupings that are united by gross morphology. This is often result of a common mode of life, often one that is generalist, leading to generally similar body shapes by convergent evolution. The term wastebasket taxon is sometimes employed in a derogatory fashion to refer to an evolutionary grade taxon.

Pure sodium aluminate (anhydrous) is a white crystalline solid having a formula variously given as NaAlO2, NaAl(OH)4 (hydrated), Na2O¬∑Al2O3, or Na2Al2O4. Commercial sodium aluminate is available as a solution or a solid. Other related compounds, sometimes called sodium aluminate, prepared by reaction of Na2O and Al2O3 are Na5AlO4 which contains discrete AlO45‚àí anions, Na7Al3O8 and Na17Al5O16 which contain complex polymeric anions, and NaAl11O17, once mistakenly believed to be Œ≤-alumina, a phase of aluminium oxide.\\"Identification and characterisation of three novel compounds in the sodium‚Äìaluminium‚Äìoxygen system\\", Marten G.

Aluminium hydroxide (gibbsite) can be dissolved in 20‚Äì25% aqueous NaOH solution at a temperature near the boiling point. The use of more concentrated NaOH solutions leads to a semi-solid product. The process must be carried out in steam-heated vessels of nickel or steel, and the aluminium hydroxide should be boiled with approximately 50% aqueous caustic soda until a pulp forms. The final mixture has to be poured into a tank and cooled; a solid mass containing about 70% NaAlO2 then forms. After being crushed, this product is dehydrated in a rotary oven.

Reaction of aluminium metal and alkali Sodium aluminate is also formed by the action of sodium hydroxide on elemental aluminium which is an amphoteric metal. The reaction is highly exothermic once established and is accompanied by the rapid evolution of hydrogen gas. The reaction is sometimes written as: : 2Al + 2NaOH + 2H2O ‚Üí 2NaAlO2 \\\\+ 3H2 however the species produced in solution is likely to contain the [Al(OH)4]‚àí ion or perhaps the [Al(H2O)2(OH)4]‚àí ion. Uses In water treatment it is used as an adjunct to water softening systems, as a coagulant aid to improve flocculation, and for removing dissolved silica and phosphates. In construction technology, sodium aluminate is employed to accelerate the solidification of concrete, mainly when working during frost. Sodium aluminate is also used in the paper industry, for fire brick production, alumina production and so forth.

History  Diagram of Jacobs Cavern Jacobs Cavern is named after its discoverer, E. H. Jacobs of Bentonville, Arkansas. It was scientifically explored by him, in company with Charles Peabody and Warren K. Moorehead, in 1903. The findings were published in that year by Jacobs in the Benton County Sun; by C. N. Gould in Science, July 31, 1903; by Peabody in the Am. Anthropologist, Sept. 903; and in the Am. Journ. Archaeology, 1904; and by Peabody and Moorehead, 1904, as Bulletin I. of the Dept. of Archaeology in Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, in the museum of which are exhibits, maps and photographs. Jacobs Cavern is a small cave, hardly more than a rock shelter, and is entirely in the St. Joe Formation of the Mississippian subperiod. Its roof is a single flat stratum of limestone; its walls are well marked by lines of stratification; dripstone also partly covers the walls, fills a deep fissure at the end of the cave, and spreads over the floor, where it mingles with an ancient bed of ashes, forming an ash-breccia (mostly firm and solid) that encloses fragments of sandstone, flint spalls, flint implements, charcoal and bones. Underneath is the true floor of the cave, a mass of homogeneous yellow clay, one meter in thickness. It holds scattered fragments of limestone, and is itself the result of limestone degeneration. The length of the opening is over 21 meters; its depth 14 meters, and the height of roof above the undisturbed ash deposit varied from 1 m 20 cm to 2 m 60 cm The bone recess at the end was from 50 cm. to 80 cm. in height. The stratum of ashes was from 50 cm to 1 m 50 cm thick. The ash surface was staked off into square meters, and the substance carefully removed in order. Each stalactite, stalagmite and pilaster was measured, numbered, and removed in sections. Six human skeletons were found buried in the ashes. Seven-tenths of a cubic metre of animal bones were found: deer, bear, wolf, raccoon, opossum, beaver, buffalo, elk, turkey, woodchuck, tortoise and hog; all contemporary with man's occupancy. Three stone metates, one stone axe, one celt and fifteen hammerstones were found. Jacobs Cavern was peculiarly rich in flint knives and projectile points. The sum total amounts to 419 objects, besides hundreds of fragments, cores, spalls and rejects, retained for study and comparison. Considerable numbers of bone or horn awls were found in the ashes, as well as fragments of pottery, but no ceremonial objects. The rude type of the implements, the absence of fine pottery, and the peculiarities of the human remains, indicate a trace of occupants more ancient than the mound- builders. The deepest implement observed was buried 50 cm under the stalagmitic surface. Dr. Hovey has proved that the rate of stalagmitic growth in Wyandotte Cave, Indiana, is .0254 cm. annually; and if that was the rate in Jacobs Cavern, 1968 years would have been needed for the embedding of that implement. Polished rocks outside the cavern and pictographs in the vicinity indicate the work of a prehistoric race earlier than the Osage Indians, who were the historic owners previous to the advent of Europeans.

It is a poisonous nightshade species from Africa and not related to true apples. The term \\"soda apple\\" probably derives from \\"Sodom apple\\", modified due to the fruit's detergent properties. Description It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa south to South Africa, in a wide range of soil, terrain, and climatic conditions. It is highly branched and reaches 1‚Äì5 m high, with numerous sharp, hooked, brown thorns. The leaves are ovate, up to 15 cm long and 13 cm broad, with lobed margins and downy undersides. It flowers (in South Africa) from September to July, peaking from November to March. The petals are white to pale violet surrounding the ovary, the flower also has a bitter, sour smell. These yield to fruit from April to January, peaking in June and November. These smooth, round berries are 6 cm in diameter and fade from green to yellow as they ripen. These berries contain high levels of the poisonous alkaloid solanine. The species name aculeastrum refers to the thorns that adorn most parts of the shrub. Uses Because of its dense growth and prickly nature, soda apple is used as a hedge and living barrier for containing livestock. It is often used as a soap replacement, as it is high in saponin. Traditional Zulu practices use the fruit - fresh, boiled, or charred - in herbal medicine to treat a wide variety of afflictions, including cancer, toothaches, and ringworm.

For evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant and \\"not excluded by the rules of evidence\\",Richard Glover, Murphy on Evidence (2015), p. 29. which generally means that it must not be unfairly prejudicial, and it must have some indicia of reliability. The general rule in evidence is that all relevant evidence is admissible and all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible, though some countries (such as the United States and, to an extent, Australia) proscribe the prosecution from exploiting evidence obtained in violation of constitutional law, thereby rendering relevant evidence inadmissible. This rule of evidence is called the exclusionary rule. In the United States this was effectuated federally in 1914 under the Supreme Court case Weeks v. United States and incorporated against the states in 1961 in the case Mapp v. Ohio, both of which involving law enforcement conducting warrantless searches of the petitioners' homes, with incriminating evidence being descried inside them.  Criteria  = Relevance = For evidence to be admissible, it must tend to prove or disprove some fact at issue in the proceeding.Hill, Gerald N., and Kathleen T. Hill. \\"Probative Legal Definition of Probative.\\" The Free Dictionary by Farlex. July 2007. Farlex Inc. 2 July 2007. However, if the utility of this evidence is outweighed by its tendency to cause the fact finder to disapprove of the party it is introduced against for some unrelated reason, it is not admissible. Furthermore, certain public- policy considerations bar the admission of otherwise relevant evidence. = Reliability = For evidence to be admissible enough to be admitted, the party proffering the evidence must be able to show that the source of the evidence makes it so. If evidence is in the form of witness testimony, the party that introduces the evidence must lay the groundwork for the witness's credibility and knowledge. Hearsay is generally barred for its lack of reliability. If the evidence is documentary, the party proffering the evidence must be able to show that it is authentic, and must be able to demonstrate the chain of custody from the original author to the present holder. The trial judge performs a \\"gatekeeping\\" role in excluding unreliable testimony. The United States Supreme Court first addressed the reliability requirement for experts in the landmark case Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc..Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The Court laid out four non-exclusive factors that trial courts may consider when evaluating scientific expert reliability: (1) whether scientific evidence has been tested and the methodology with which it has been tested; (2) whether the evidence has been subjected to peer review or publication; (3) whether a potential rate of error is known; and (4) whether the evidence is generally accepted in the scientific community. Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael later extended the Daubert analysis to include all expert testimony.Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999). It bears an effect on the verdict of the court. = Issues with admissibility of evidence in non-democratic regimes = In some non-democratic legal systems, the courts effectively function as organs of those in power, and the rules of evidence are designed to favor their interests. In the People's Republic of China, for example, it has been observed that courts have historically accepted evidence that would be excluded in other systems, such as confessions obtained by torture. Evidence was introduced by the court itself, rather than the state, and evidence was used as part of \\"a process of legitimising the conclusion which had already been drawn before the trial\\".Jianfu Chen, Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law in the People's Republic of China (2013), p. 85-99.

It is thrown with a spiral-like spin, so that there is no Magnus force on the ball as it arrives at home plate. The gyroball is sometimes confused with the shuuto, another pitch used in Japan. Overview The gyroball pitch was first identified by the Japanese scientist Ryutaro Himeno (Âß´Èáé ÈæçÂ§™ÈÉé), and later developed into a specific throwing technique by baseball instructor Kazushi Tezuka (ÊâãÂ°ö ‰∏ÄÂøó), who used computer simulations to create a new style of delivery intended to reduce stress on the pitcher. They published their work in a book, currently available only in Japan, the title of which is roughly translated as The Secret of the Miracle Pitch (È≠îÁêÉ„ÅÆÊ≠£‰Ωì). However, the technique to throwing the gyroball is all in the arms, not in the unique grip of the baseball. Kazushi Tezuka is an instructor at the Jyoutatsuya baseball dojo in Tokyo, and Osaka, Japan. According to Tezuka, use of the arms \\"is the most important part of throwing the gyroball. It has nothing to do with the hands.\\"Brett Bull, \\"Unwinding the Gyroball,\\" SI.com January 30, 2006 Himeno and Tezuka have said, a gyroball is thrown so that at the point of release, instead of having the pitcher's elbow move inwards, towards the body (the standard method used in the United States), the pitcher rotates his elbow so that it moves away from his body, toward third base for a right-handed pitcher and toward first base for a left-handed pitcher. This is also known as pronation. The unusual method of delivery creates a bullet-like spin on the ball with the axis of spin in line with the direction of the throw, similar to the way an American football is thrown. Tezuka has stated, if the pitch is thrown correctly, it will fly straight like a fastball. Contrary to early speculation that the gyroball was a late moving breaking ball, the fact that the pitch travels with a bullet-spin denotes that the baseball is stabilized, hence the lack of movement. In baseball, most pitches are thrown with back- spin, like the usual fastball, or with a top-spin, like the curveball and the slider. When throwing a gyroball, a pitcher holds the side of the ball with a fastball grip placed on the baseball's center (or equator). The pitcher's hips and throwing shoulder must be in near-perfect sync, something the book refers to as \\"double-spin mechanics.\\" According to Tezuka, the arm angle needs to be low, no higher than a sidearm delivery. As the pitcher rotates his shoulder, he snaps his wrist and pulls down his fingers rather than flipping them over the ball, as happens with curveballs. For the correct spin axis, the equatorial plane must first be determined by the proper finger pressure during release. The ball rolls off the index and middle fingers to the thumb side of the hand as the pitch is released. If gripped in the right manner, the rotation will have a true side-spin; if the ball is held above or below its equator, the rotation would be unstable. When the pitcher lets go, he must pronate his wrist, or turn it so the palm faces third base. An Analysis of the Gyroball. Alan Nathan and Dave Baldwin, \\"An Analysis of the Gyroball.\\" Incidentally, the flight of some Knuckleball pitches, such as those thrown by R.A. Dickey, also have a forward pointing rotational axis similar to a gyroball. The difference is, the knuckleball spins significantly more slowly and has less velocity, which greatly subjects the baseball to the effects of drag as well as gravity, and translates into an erratic flight-path.Anatomy of a Really Nasty Pitch Alan M. Nathan, \\"Anatomy of a Really Nasty Pitch\\" However, this shows that a bullet-like spiral is consistently achievable despite differing methods of pitch delivery. A gyroball's stability is dependent upon its rotation speed and the amount of forward motion, resulting in a straight trajectory with less drop. Batters use the arm speed of the pitcher and the spin on a baseball, made visible by the seams, to judge the speed and trajectory of a pitch. The gyroball is thrown with the arm speed of a usual fastball, but with a different actual speed. Its bullet-like spinning motion may hide the seams of a ball from the view of the batter, making it difficult to predict the pitch. Typical strategy entails throwing many variations of pitches, followed by a gyroball. The batter, predicting a change in speed caused by the ball's spin, may adapt to the wrong speed and swing incorrectly. The gyroball is also often confused with a completely different Japanese pitch called the shuuto, due to an error in a well-known article by baseball writer Will Carroll.Will Carroll,\\"The Ghost Pitch\\" Although Carroll later corrected himself, the confusion still persists. Appearance in popular culture =Video games= In March 2005, Baseball Mogul was the first game to include the \\"Gyroball\\". The pitch was included in the arsenal of Daisuke Matsuzaka. However, because Matsuzaka was not yet with the Red Sox, players had to simulate into the 2006 season before the gyroball became available. Additionally, the gyroball is available in Baseball Mogul's player editor, and can be learned in Spring Training by pitchers that enter the game after 2005. In the game's graphical play-by-play mode, the pitch comes out of the pitcher's hand as a fastball, but fails to rise like a traditional four-seam fastball. In the video game MLB 07: The Show and the more recent The Bigs, only Daisuke Matsuzaka has the ability to throw the gyroball, although the movement of the pitch in the video game differs from the movement of the actual pitch. Daisuke Matsuzaka has himself stated, \\"looks like they are talking about my cut fastball or sinking slider. I guess sometimes it has a similar rotation of a gyro, when I fail to throw the cut fastball or the slider properly, but it is not exactly a gyro itself. It is different. There is a particular way of throwing it. I guess it is a kind of shuuto-like cut fastball\\". (However, in the long-lasting Japan-Baseball game series Jikky≈ç Powerful Pro Yaky≈´ series, Daisuke is never given \\"Gyroball\\" ability for any installment, nor in the MLB Power Pros series installment.) It is an obtainable ability in the MLB Power Pros series, and its effect is to make the fastball look faster. =Japanese animation= In the Japanese manga and anime baseball series Major, the protagonist, Goro, is known for his use of the gyroball pitch, which was his only pitch until he eventually adds a forkball to his repertoire.

A careful computer analysis of Matsuzaka's pitches for the Boston Red Sox for the first half of the 2007 season by Dan Fox of Baseball Prospectus suggests that while Matsuzaka commands a dazzling array of pitches, the gyroball is more myth than reality. However, Daisuke has said he is trying to learn to throw the trick pitch.Dan Fox, \\"Schrodinger's Bat: Searching for the Gyroball,\\" BaseballProspectus.com, July 5, 2007. *C.J.

He guesses because the gyro axle is inclined in irregularity. But while trying to learn the gyro, Wilson developed a new hybrid pitch, which he calls the Cork. The Cork, described by Wilson, is a \\"rising cut fastball.\\" He uses this as his out pitch against left-handed hitters. In the ALCS 2010 Game 1 press conference on October 14, 2010, he said he doesn't believe it's very good for the arm, so he doesn't throw it very much.

She left school at the age of 20, while she was doing a German Language and Literature M.A. at the Istanbul University. She played in A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu as bihter. At the age of 21, she married TV director Samim Deƒüer and started to work as a model before taking part in Turkish B movies. After making about 100 B films & family comedy films between early 70s and early 1980s, her breakthrough came with the 1984 Yavuz Turgul film Fahriye Abla (Sister Fahriye). Fahriye Abla was the screen adaptation of Ahmed Muhip Dranas' poem of the same name. Her portrayal of modern, sensual, independent, rebel woman in her films after Fahriye Abla won the hearts of Turkish filmgoers. It was considered a revolution in the relatively conservative mainstream Turkish cinema at that time, when females played mostly second fiddle roles. Mujde Ar then became the cult object of women cinema and the lead of many films by renowned Turkish directors Atƒ±f Yƒ±lmaz, Halit Refiƒü, Ba≈üar Sabuncu, Ertem Eƒüilmez. Her filmography includes Dul Bir Kadƒ±n (Widow), Daƒüƒ±nƒ±k Yatak (Messy Bed), Ahhh Belinda, Adƒ± Vasfiye (Her Name Was Vasfiye), Asiye Nasƒ±l Kurtulur (Who Can Save Asiye?), Asƒ±lacak Kadƒ±n (Woman to Be Hanged), Teyzem (Auntie), Kar≈üƒ±la≈üma (Encounter), Aƒüƒ±r Roman (Heavy Fiction).

She was launched on 15 April 1967 and commissioned on 28 December 1967. Transferred to the 9th Submarine Squadron of the Pacific Fleet, B-39 was homeported in Vladivostok. She conducted patrols and stalked U.S. warships throughout the North Pacific, along the coast of the United States and Canada, and ranging as far as the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. After the end of the Vietnam War, she often made port visits to Danang. During the early 1970s, B-39 trailed a Canadian frigate through Strait of Juan de Fuca to Vancouver Island.

Early years Kolvenbach's childhood was spent in Druten, near Nijmegen in the Netherlands. There he attended Canisius College for his secondary studies, where he concentrated on modern languages. He entered the novitiate at Mariendaal on 7 September 1948. After completing philosophy studies at Berchmans Institute in Nijmegen, he was assigned to Lebanon, where he completed his doctorate in Sacred Theology at Universit√© de Saint-Joseph in Beirut. On 29 June 1961, he was ordained a priest in the Armenian Catholic Church, an Eastern-rite church in communion with Rome. The next years of his life were spent in academia, specifically in linguistics. From 1964 to 1976 he taught general and Oriental linguistics in The Hague, Paris, and then Beirut where he became Professor of General Linguistics and Armenian at Universit√© Saint-Joseph. He served in that capacity until 1981, when he became rector of the Pontifical Oriental Institute. During his time on the faculty of Saint- Joseph, he also served as provincial superior of the Jesuit vice-province of the Middle East. Father General On 7 August 1981, Father General Pedro Arrupe suffered a severe stroke in the plane on his way back to Rome. Although he survived for another ten years, he wanted to step down as Superior General. Though Arrupe proposed Vincent O'Keefe of Fordham University as interim successor, Pope John Paul II intervened and named Paolo Dezza his delegate to lead the order for an interim period. Two years later John Paul II allowed the Jesuits to proceed in selecting their new leader. Meeting in September 1983, the 33rd General Congregation of the Society of Jesus accepted the formal resignation of Father Arrupe and on the first ballot elected Father Kolvenbach to be 29th Superior General of the Jesuits. Kolvenbachtook office at a time when the Jesuits' \\"strongly pro-social justice and church reform orientation was seen by critics as having made the Jesuits something akin to John Paul‚Äôs in-house opposition. ...Over time, Kolvenbach was credited with having managed to win back the trust of John Paul II and his Vatican team, without alienating the more liberal members of the order.\\" meeting each Jesuit personally. He is credited with successfully defending French Jesuit theologian Jacques Dupuis from charges made by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and Fr. Thomas J.

As the Superior General is elected for life, Kolvenbach was only the second to resign the office. The 35th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus convened on 5 January 2008 in Rome. On 14 January it accepted Kolvenbach's resignation and elected Adolfo Nicol√°s as his successor.

He is also the creator and writer of several other comedies for the BBC including The Sunday Format, Broken News, W1A and Twenty Twelve. Morton gave up a career as an English teacher to become a writer in 1990. His first success came when BBC Radio accepted his pilot comedy script for People Like Us. It ran for three series on BBC Radio 4 from 1995 and won Sony Radio Award and a Writer's Guild Award for Best Radio Comedy before being adapted for BBC Two (with Langham in the same role) in 1999. Morton went on to create and write the Sony Radio Award-winning satirical newspaper supplement show The Sunday Format for BBC Radio 4 and co- created the BBC One sitcom Kiss Me Kate with Chris Langham. For the launch night of BBC Four in 2001 John wrote the one-off special The Gist, a spoof arts review show presented by Robert Webb. In 2005 Morton teamed up with writer Tony Roche on Broken News, a six-part comedy series about a 24-hour rolling news station which broadcast on BBC Two. In August 2010, the BBC announced a new six-part series Twenty Twelve, written and directed by Morton. This series is centered on the organisers of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, similar to ABC Australia's The Games. John Clarke and Ross Stevenson, creators of The Games, claimed to have had many phone conferences, meetings and over four years of email exchanges with Morton, and yet the series was made without their participation or permission. Following a 'thorough legal assessment', the BBC rejected their claims stating that; 'while the premise of the two shows was similar ‚Äì focusing on the buildup to the staging of the Olympic games ‚Äì the content and the style of the two shows was very different'. The series commenced on 14 March 2011 on BBC Four. A second series was broadcast on BBC2 in the run up to the 2012 London Olympic Games. Morton is married to the actress Helen Atkinson-Wood who, on first hearing People Like Us on the radio, rang the BBC in praise of the programme and was given Morton's phone number. She called him to tell him how much she liked it and Morton is said to have replied \\"Thanks a lot.

It is the band's only completely instrumental album, with each of its songs named after and inspired by different locations on the path. It was a project between Show Of Hands and The South West Coast Path Team, as part of the latter's celebrations for the silver jubilee (25th anniversary) of the path. As such the album is endorsed by various organisations who own different parts of the path, namely The Countryside Agency, The National Trust and English Heritage Commission,.and the music is ambient instrumentals inspired by different locations around the coastline. The duo hoped that, with the album, listeners would be inspired to discover or rediscover the \\"endless fascination\\" of the coast path.Album liner notes The album was released on 14 April 2003 by the duo's own label Hands on Music, a month before they released their following album Country Life. In July 2012, music from The Path featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path, which attracts some 400,000 hits a year.http://www.spiralearth.co.uk/news/story.asp?nid=6371 One track from the album, \\"Port Isaac\\", featured on their compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands (2007).

Critical praise greeted both releases, and the duo embarked on The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001, where they played a great deal of unreleased or \\"rare\\" material. The band's live album Cold Cuts (2002), which was drawn from material from the tour, was released to positive reviews. The duo began writing for what they planned to be their next album. The logo of The National Trust, who own some of the path and whose logo features on the album. Meanwhile, The Countryside Agency were looking to celebrate the silver jubilee (25th anniversary) of the South West Coast Path, a National Trail that remains the longest waymarked long-distance footpath (and one of the longest in the UK). It stretches for , running from Minehead in Somerset, along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. It is also one of the more challenging trails as it rises and falls with every river mouth, and its total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft (35,031 m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted \\"Britain's Best Walking Route\\" twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks. The South West Coast Path Association formed in 1973, and after being constructed over five years, the path was opened in 1978. To celebrate the silver jubilee of the association in 1998, they set up a fund to raise money for markers at Minehead and South Haven Point, and erected \\"Path Markers\\" on the path at Minehead in 2001 and South Haven Point in 2002. To celebrate the silver jubilee of the path's opening, Show of Hands, who had begun work on their tenth album Country Life, were asked by The South West Coast Path Association to create an album of music celebrating the path and the sites that it visits. Show of Hands are from Devon, the only English country to have two coastlines, and the South West Coast Path crosses both of them. As such, it became a local project for the duo. The duo changed their focus from Country Life to the album concerning the coast path's silver jubilee. As different parts of the path are owned by different charities and organisations, namely The National Trust, English Heritage and The Countryside Agency, the album would also be endorsed by those organisations. The duo named the album simply The Path, after the path. Music A map of the South West Coast Path.

Each of the album's sixteen tracks is named after a specific location on the path's track. As such, the album is seen as a concept album. The duo's website states that the album \\"creates an atmospheric musical portrait of the sea, and the seaside\\". Whilst the album is folk music, it has also been described as an ambient album. Describing the coast path, the duo noted that \\"the full 630 mile adventure around the coastline of the southwest peninsula has now become the region's most popular attraction. From the Exmoor National Park to Poole harbour there is no better way to enjoy our dramatic coastline, its wildlife, history and culture,\\" and the duo hoped that, with the album, listeners would be inspired to discover - or rediscover its \\"endless fascination\\". The album is co-produced between Show of Hands, Matt Clifford and Mick Dolan, and all producers wrote music featured on the album, making this a departure from most of the duo's previous albums, which were predominately written by Steve Knightley of the duo. Several of the tracks are instrumental reworkings of older material. Knightley wrote the album's first track, \\"Foreland Point\\", whilst the second track, \\"Braunton Burrows\\", is adapted from a track from Beer's sporadic collaborator Paul Downes, whilst his composition \\"Lamorna Cave\\" was also recorded for the seventh track. Matt Clifford wrote the third track, \\"Buck's Mills\\". The fourth track, \\"Port Isaac\\", is essentially an instrumental reworking of the duo's earlier song \\"Cousin Jack\\", about miners of the Cornish diaspora departing from Port Isaac, which featured on their sixth studio album Dark Fields (1997). The final, sixteenth track, \\"The Foreland ‚Äì Reprise\\", is a reworking of the album's first track, \\"Foreland Point\\". Phil Beer of the duo had previously released the collaborative album Ridgeriders in 1999, a soundtrack to the ITV Meridian television series of the same name presented by Nick Knowles which featured Knowles visiting the ancient trackways of Southern England on a motorcycle. The album, a collaboration between Ashley Hutchings, Chris While, The Albion Band and Julie Matthews, was also a \\"journey\\" concept album featuring sixteen songs mostly set in different locations in Southern England, with some of the songs named after the locations, making it similar in some sense to The Path. Ridgeriders was released in June 1999 to positive reviews, including one from Living Tradition who said \\"interesting concept album with enough interest for those who never saw the series, but for those readers north of the Border, it is very English in feel.\\" Release and legacy Pendeen Lighthouse (pictured in 2002) features on the album cover. The Path was released on 14 April 2003 on Compact Disc by the duo's own record label Hands on Music with the catalogue number HMCD18. The album cover features a photograph of Pendeen Lighthouse, which is visited on the path, by Graham Norways. The back cover features the logos for The National Trust, English Heritage and The Countryside Agency. The duo explained that this was because the coast path is mostly funded by The Countryside Agency, whilst a third of the land the path crosses is owned by The National Trust, whilst Pendennis Castle, visited in the path and the name of one of the track's on the album, is within the ownership of English Heritage.Back cover. The disc face features a map of the coast path.Disc face. The album was not reviewed by any publications, perhaps due to its low-key release. After the album's release, the duo returned to work on Country Life, which was released in October 2003. Country Life ironically features a greater focus on rural issues, most notably on its first song, \\"Country Life\\", a \\"stirring\\" and \\"finely honed rant about the desecration of British country life\\" It was packaged with a bonus disc which contained CD-ROM bonus material, including a lyrics section set to \\"The Exe Estuary\\" from The Path. The same track was also performed live by Knightley in an acoustic variation for his BBC Radio 4 documentary Open Country in 2010. In July 2012, music from The Path featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path, which attracts some 400,000 hits a year.

This process keeps an individual from being overwhelmed with information overload. =Discussion= Meaning can be described as the \\"system of mental representations of an object or phenomenon, its properties and associations with other objects and/or phenomena. In the consciousness of an individual, meaning is reflected in the form of sensory information, images and concepts.\\" It is denotative or connotative, but the sign system for transmitting meanings can be uncertain in its operation or conditions may disrupt the communication and prevent accurate meanings from being decoded. Further, meaning is socially constructed and dynamic as the culture evolves. That is problematic because an individual's frame of reference and experience may produce some divergence from some of the prevailing social norms. So the salience of data will be determined by both situational and emotional elements in a combination relatively unique to each individual. For example, a person with an interest in botany may allocate greater salience to visual data involving plants, and a person trained as an architect may scan buildings to identify features of interest. A person's world view or Weltanschauung may predispose salience to data matching those views. Because people live for many years, responses become conventional. At a group or community level, the conventional levels of significance or salience are slowly embedded in the sign systems and culture, and they cannot arbitrarily be changed. For example, the first thing seen in a poster may be the title or picture of a face. Communication studies The noun \\"salience\\" derives from the Latin word saliens - ‚Äòleaping, or bounding‚Äô. In a human embryo, the heart tissue is beating and leaping. A Native American may pay no attention to Columbus Day protests until after instruction in tribal and historical Indian traditions (priming). After gaining new cultural insights, these protests may become \\"salient.\\" Salience, as a component of Communication and Social Psychology studies, asks the question of why something captures and holds our attention and why it is more readily available as a cognition than other facts, feelings, and emotions? When a person perceives and reacts, they use the information and emotions most readily accessible. This information is understood to be the most salient information. Social Influence is an area of intense study for Social Psychologists and Communication theorists. Social Influence asks how and why, are people influenced to weaken a strongly held position, adopt a new position, change an attitude, or persuade someone? The extent that the communicator can understand and harness the power of Social Influence is the extent that they can succeed in their goal. Salience has been identified as one of the key ideas that guides our understanding of how to make a point of view stand out from among others and draw the receivers attention to the salient points of the encoded message. Salience is then an important concept in several theories relating to Social Influence. Some areas of Communication and Social Psychology research that include the concept of salience as a component of their theory are: Persuasion Theory, Vested Interest, Summation Theory of Attitude Change, Group Salience, and Social Presence Theory. The use of salience in these theories is summarized below: Persuasion theory: Salience is the critical concept, along with agenda and spin, for the Persuasion theory of Professor Richard E. Vatz of Towson University as articulated in his book, /The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion/, (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013). Salience, in his book and articles, is used as a measure of how reality is created for chosen audiences. He claims (1973) (2013) that the struggle for salience (and agenda and meaning and spin) is the sine qua non of the persuasive process. Vested interest (communication theory): William Crano's states that, \\"Vested Interest refers to the extent to which an attitude object is hedonically relevant for the attitude holder\\" (Crano, 1995, p. 131). In order for someone to have a vested interest in something, it must be perceived to affect their lives personally. Things that in which we are highly vested also bear on our behavior (Crano, 1995), and it must be salient or leap out. Vivid cues are more likely to grab our attention (McArthur & Post, 1977). If an attitude object is salient to us, our vested interest will be increased as well as the likelihood that our behavior and attitudes will be consistent (Sears & Citrin, 1985). Crano states, \\"Apparently, making an attitude object more salient enhances the salience of attitude-relevant outcomes as well. Vividness, priming, and similar operations may all enhance the salience of the self-interest implications of a position.\\" (Crano, 1995, p. 131). The stronger the salience of our attitude, the stronger will be the connection between our attitude object and our behavior. Attitude Summation Theory: Fishbein posited that we have many beliefs about an attitude object (characteristics, attributes, values, etc.). Each belief held is argued to have an affective (feeling) and evaluative (value determining) component. An attitude is then a mediated evaluative response (Fishbein, 1963). These attitudes sum together to form our overall view of the attitude object and comes to the forefront (made salient) when we engage the attitude object. Fishbein indicates that we can hold six to nine salient beliefs at a time (Cronen, 1973). Those manifested during the attitude object encounter determine the prevailing attitude. Fishbein believed that the strongest held beliefs would be the most salient and come to the fore. Cronen argued that salience is not intrinsically tied to strength, but is an independent attribute of attitude change, as some strongly held beliefs are non-salient (Cronen, 1973). Group Salience: Group salience is a person's cognizance of fellow group members similarities and differences within a group interaction (Harwood et al., 2006). Within a group, communication is the primary way that we determine salience of attitudes. Other things such as physical attributes can be observed, but deeper feelings will have to be communicated within the group to make them salient (Harwood et al., 2006). Coupland et al., suggest that communication processes represent an individual's identity within the group (Coupland et al., 1991). Social presence theory (SPT): SPT can be defined as, \\"The degree to which a person is perceived to be a real person in mediated communication.\\" (Gunwadena, 1995) This is an update on the original definition, developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976), which stated, \\"The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction.\\" What makes something salient? How does the mind select, structure and impart meaning to stimuli? People \\"develop and stabilize\\" cognitions about stimuli by an \\"examination of action, intention, ability and environment.\\" (Taylor & Fiske, 1978, citing Heider, 1934, as their source, p. 250). Individuals have limited cognitive resources and abilities to process and comprehend information and situational complexity. A person cannot grasp every nuance of a stimuli required to assign its full and complete meaning. Salience is the way researchers understand what information will most likely capture one's attention in a given situation and have the greatest influence on one's cognitions about the stimuli. Research has shown that the most salient information is not always the most accurate or important, but a \\"Top of the Head Phenomenon\\" (Taylor & Fiske, 1978). People are not fully conscious of the extent to which salience affects them. In experimental studies, individuals generated strong cognitions with only slight manipulation of stimuli. When shown this fact, the participant reacted strongly to the idea that they made choices based on \\"trivial\\" information (Taylor & Fiske, 1978). \\"Salience has generally been treated as a propriety [conforming to standard norms of morality and behavior] of a stimulus which allows it to stand out and be noticed\\" (Guido, 1998, p. 114). Guido developed the Theory of Dichotic Salience after a review of some 1,200 studies, which pointed to a \\"common origin among salience instances, by emphasizing the nature of prominence which is intrinsic to any salience construct\\" (Guido, 1998, Abstract, p. 114). According to this theory, a stimulus is \\"in-salient\\" if it is not in harmony with perceiver's worldview. It is \\"re-salient\\" if it is in harmony with the perceiver's goals (Guido, 1998). Salience is a construct that depends on the ability of the mind to access the feelings or emotions (affect) generated by the salient stimulus. The activation in memory of cognitions that relate to and evaluate the stimulus. And finally, the availability of these mental resources to engage the stimulus (Guido, 1998). A schema (psychology) is a cognitive framework or concept through which one organizes and interprets information. Schemas provide shortcuts in sorting and interpreting the enormous quantity of information generated in one's environment. The limitation of such a construct, is that it may cause one to exclude pertinent facts and feelings about a situation. Instead one may focus on only those that harmonize with one's biases, beliefs and ideations. Schemas are very useful as they help one to decide about things with very little information. This simplification filters how one allocates cognitive resources. It also allows one to learn more readily and rapidly, if the learning fits within an already established schema. A schema allows for quick access to stored cognitions and filtering through pre-established algorithms, which saves time in processing and retrieving information. Because they are so useful and reliable in helping one make sense of the world, schemas can be hard to change. Thomas Kuhn (1962), in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, talks about how scientists, considered the most rationale and fact driven professionals, can be so committed to their schemas that they ignore or misinterpret relevant data gathered from experiments that is contrary to their notions. One challenge for communicators is to find a way to break through these hardened perceptions in order to persuade. Making an idea salient is one of the keys. Guido's Principle one is figure-ground, which is the means the perceptual field from which people direct their attention towards something that stands out. Figurality is the brightness, complexity, and energy (movement) of a stimulus. It is thought that these aspects trigger cognitions and thought processes in the brain that lead to salience. Brightness includes the magnitude and the colors of the object. Studies have shown that bright, vibrant colors more easily capture the attention and are easier to remember (Guido, 1998). Complexity builds upon the contextual factors (the number of perceptible qualities about the stimulus object that one can distinguish) and learning (what we perceive as unfamiliar). Complexity is the interaction of the familiarity, unfamiliarity, and the number of aspects of the stimulus object that we can resolve. Complexity is the interaction of these stimuli interact to engage affect and cognitions developed about the object (Guido, 1998). Movement of an object engages sensory receptors, which when sparked, send stimuli to the body and brain. Moving pictures, signs and eyes are used to capture our attention and make us pay attention (Guido, 1998). Novelty is the \\"isolation\\" of the stimulus from other stimuli (objects). This isolation or uniqueness sets it apart from other objects in the background, so that it can be noticed (Guido, 1998). This can also be expressed as comparative distinctiveness (Higgins, 1996). Guido's Principle two is Unusuality, which can be broken down into statistical novelty (unique and unfamiliar), unexpectancy, out of role behaviors, negativity and extremity (emotional impact). Novelty is the degree that one has no experience with the stimuli. Unexpectancy is a result of learning. We have developed an expectation that is violated (Guido, 1998). Negativity is our gut reaction. Extremity is the emotional impact of the Negativity. Each of these contributes to making something salient. Accessibility and Salience. When we evaluate a situation, what comes first to our minds? The things that come to mind are those that are most accessible (most readily recalled and those that are most salient (Kreech and Crutchfield, 1948). Our beliefs and thoughts vary in salience. Salient beliefs are most easily activated in the cognitive processes and are more easily recalled, and are therefore more accessible (Higgins, 1996). Salience is determined by stimuli, such as brightness, contract, situational properties, schemas, expectations, arousal, and properties of the interpreter (e.g., need state, enduring beliefs, and motivations). The interconnectedness of these stimuli causes the brain to be activated and information salient to the situation recalled and acted upon. Information stored in memory, that is accessible, can be recalled either by a cue or free association. Information that is not accessible, cannot be recalled and therefore is not available for use in interpreting a situation. Higgins (1996) defines a memory's activation potential as having three properties: 1. the possibility that the knowledge can be recalled (not repressed or lost), 2. how easily accessible is it, and 3.the intensity or the energy of the memory. To the extent that memories are available, accessible, and have sufficient effect is the extent that these memories will be activated and that knowledge is brought to bear on the situation at hand. Cramer (1968, p. 82) defines priming as \\"a change in antecedent conditions which is specifically designed to increase the probability of a particular response given to a particular stimulus\\". The process of priming can activate a particular memory to bring it to the fore so that it can be engaged in a communication or social influence situation. Priming has been shown to increase accessibility of relevant knowledge (Higgins, 1996). Priming is, then, any event that causes increased accessibility and availability of a framework of knowledge (schema) useful for that particular situation. In journalism, priming is associated with framing. When an author writes an article to persuade, he or she frames certain information so that it is more salient to the reader (Weaver, 2007). Framing including writing decisions about definitions of words and events, causal linkages, moral implications, and solution sets for the problem area (McCombs, 1997). Our minds sort information available using our agenda (framing) and stimulus (priming) for that situation and activate it to accomplish our purpose. When one encounters a stimulus for the first time, the initial reaction is characterized as unconditioned response. An unconditioned response is one that \\"elicits a national, reflexive response.\\" (Weseley & McEntarffer, 2014, p. 136). Subsequent encounters will elicit a conditioned response has been developed through the learning that occurred with the intervening encounters with the stimulus. This learning is bedrock knowledge on which one draws when responding to a given situation. (Weseley & McEntarffer, 2014). If the first time one ate ice cream the experience was pleasant, the second experience will be informed from the firs. The second experience will generate salient pleasant cognitions, salivation, and other biological responses that will reinforce the pleasant salience of the experience. If on the other hand, the first encounter was negative (disgust, pain or nausea), the second encounter will generate the feeling of pain in the stomach awful memories of the first encounter. which will reinforce the negative salience of the first and second experience. Another key aspect of whether a particular memory or knowledge will be activated is whether it is applicable to the situation. If it is not applicable, it will not be salient and is unlikely to be activated for that situation. \\"According to the synapse model‚Ä¶, the process begins with the stimulus, which increases the excitation level of stored knowledge as a function of the features of the match between the attended features of the stimulus and the features of the stored knowledge.\\" (Higgins, 1996, p. 137). The stimulus information creates a pathway to the knowledge, which is then evaluated for a salience match to the stimulus. If there is a match, then the knowledge will be activated. Our minds and bodies are bombarded by relevant and irrelevant knowledge and experiences every day. We will tune into salient ones (crane the ears to more fully hear enjoyable music) and tune-out non- salient ones (cover our ears from jackhammer noise). There is difference between seeing something and looking at it. In seeing, the capacity of our retina to take in the light energy is engaged and the brain processes that information into an image. When one looks at an object, not only are visual perceptive capacities engaged, but other mental processes for evaluation and ordering of the object are activated (Skinner, 1974). Humans have gatekeeper mental mechanisms that allow certain information in and keeps others out. This discrimination process can be viewed a defensive mechanism the protects and enhances our life experience. Our processes of making cognitions \\"also involve contingencies of reinforcement.\\" (Skinner, 1974, p. 117). Skinner implies that reinforcement as \\"a special kind of stimulus control.\\" (Skinner, 1974, p. 119). Salience can be thought of as a reinforcement mechanism that make certain thoughts, feelings and emotions available, accessible, applicable and actionable within the context of the situation. Esber and Haselgrove (2011) looked at the use of predictiveness and uncertainty on stimulus salience. They cite the example of a bird watching the water for the presence of fish. Through learning, the bird associates the ripples with the closeness of the fish, but they must be careful of the uncertainty that ripple is not caused by a crocodile. The ripples are very salient, if they are caused by fish suitable for use as food. The likelihood increases that the ripples will catch the attention of the bird and improve its probability of eating the fish, if the ripple cue is a predictor of fish behavior and presence. The predictiveness of ripples reinforces its salience. The Esber‚ÄìHaselgrove model argues that (1) \\"stimuli acquire added salience to the degree that they predict motivationally relevant consequences\\", and (2) \\"a predictor of multiple reinforcers should have more salience than a predictor of just one.\\" (Esber & Haselgrove, 2011, 2555-25557). So, for example, if ripples predict both the presence of fish and the increased likelihood that the fish can be caught, they will be much more salient to the bird, than if the ripples only predict the presence of the fish, but tell the bird nothing about the probability of making a catch. Salience is a broad concept in the social sciences, that can cause confusion. Part of the confusion lies in that different researchers use the same term to posit different ideas of what makes a particular stimulus salient. When we encounter an object or idea, we may be draw to it for a variety of reasons. It may be its brightness or intensity, its predictive capacity, or other features such as uniqueness or enormity that catches one's attention. Once the attention is engaged, our brain will begin to process this information and make assessments and judgements about the encounter. Our minds and bodies will activate useful memories, biological responses and feelings that were generated from prior encounters with the object of similar objects. These memory-evaluative-feeling-biology responses will determine if the object is salient. If it is salient, we will devote more cognitive processing resources to the encounter and it will enhance or protect us in that moment. =Axioms of salience= Communication scholars have found that a number of different factors have a direct effect on the salience of attitude objects. Direct experience William Crano posits that one's direct experience with an issue or attitude object increases the salience and consequently the potency of that attitude, and the level of consistency between attitude and behavior. :For example: Consider two people: one with emphysema, one without. Both of whom share a negative attitude toward cigarette smoking. The person with emphysema would have a stronger attitude than his counterpart, and consequently would show greater consistency between his relevant attitude and behavior. It is posited by Crano that the attitude toward smoking of the person with emphysema may be more salient due to his direct experience with the consequence of smoking. Self-Interest The concept called vested interest by Crano is called self-interest by Sears (1997). It seems that \\"self-interest\\" is the more widely recognized term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that vested interest involves perceived personal consequences (p. 490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that vested interest should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything \\"strong\\" is \\"salient\\". Needs and aspirations The salience (prominence) of an attitude can also be measured by the relevance of an idea to that person's needs or aspirations. As ideals become more salient they become more accessible, the more accessible the attitude object is the stronger the attitude toward the object. As accessibility increases, so does the likelihood of self-interested voting (Young). :For example: In times of elections, issue relevant events are the focus of attention. Therefore, candidates, due to their aspiration for a certain political position are interest driven toward the salient events since they are favorable to their party. =Policy making= Political scientists agree that salience is relatively important in examining political policy, because policies are not only determined by what issues are important to people but also by how important they are. This involves examining what issues are ignored and which are made \\"important.\\" One research agenda that political scientists are concerned with understanding is \\"when and how salience and changes in salience matter for political action.\\" There are three related understandings of salience. #The first (\\"classical\\") interpretation considers salience to be independent of the \\"status quo\\" and politicians‚Äô ideal policies and programs. Although it says salience is independent of ideals, it does not say that salience is independent of preferences. This means, where there is a change in salience there is also a change in preferences. Often a player or policymaker's ideals may not be known but their preferences are usually revealed in their party's manifestos. Often policymakers cannot achieve their ideals but rather must choose between the offers on the table. They may prefer one over the other and this is where salience affects a party or a politician's position on an issue. #The second (\\"valence\\") interpretation proposes that for certain issues salience is a very important factor. In other words, when there is a general consensus of principles, the relative salience of various issues amongst the public determines the policy position of policy makers. This is due to constraints in policy making, where ideals are often induced, which policy makers view as the tradeoff space. For example, although \\"ideally\\" they may like to see low unemployment and low inflation, they are usually constrained to pick a position on the \\"tradeoff\\" line. Thus, their ideal has been induced due to constraints. In these situations salience and policy position are almost interchangeable, because their \\"induced ideal\\" is their \\"favored allocation.\\" In the classical interpretation, salience would be used to describe the different levels of preference between positions on policies. #The third (\\"price\\") interpretation assumes that salience is not separate from ideals, as the classical view states, but that it is also not the same as ideals, as the valence view claims. This interpretation assumes that although a group of players, sharing benevolent preferences, all dissatisfied with the status quo, may still value different aspects differently when considering policy change. The price interpretation is favored over the other two for three reasons. First, it is more applicable. Unlike the classical view, the price interpretation can be applied to a more wide-ranging set of situations. Second, the price interpretation uses both the classical point of view and ideals in its evaluation of salience. Not only do you need to know a player's weighted preferences but also their connection to their ideal point and the status quo. Therefore, a change in salience can reflect a change in ideal point, status quo, or their weighted preferences. Third, this interpretation can be used to determine the elements stand in importance or worth. For example, players may organize and focus their time and energy into options with the biggest pay off. \\"That is they may look to see where they get the greatest ‚Äòbang for their buck.‚Äô\\" Public opinion McCombs and Shaw‚Äôs seminal \\"Chapel Hill study\\", which researched salience and public opinion examined most of the agenda-setting research since the 1968 United States presidential election which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to mass media‚Äôs ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main hypothesis examined in this study is the ranking of certain issues by the media, which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related \\"to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc.\\" The result of this study concluded that \\"even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 election, it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or dramatic as some of the other highly salient issues such as drug abuse or environmental pollution. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements.\\" In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly. Marketing stimuli Although salience is a stimulus response, is it a stimulus quality or an absolute quality? Salience plays an important role in intergroup communication. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, \\"Group salience is a key variable both in influencing quality of intergroup contact and in moderating the effects of intergroup contact on prejudicial attitudes.\\" In their study of family communication and intergroup relationships, \\"Group salience is an individual‚Äôs awareness of group memberships and respective group differences in an intergroup encounter (e.g., the salience of race in an interracial conversation).\\" This study carefully examines the dynamics of intergroup relationships with respect to communication in a family context. Their study involved communicative aspects associated with age salience in the grandparent ‚Äì grandchild relationship, the extent to which various dimension of communication predicts measures of salience, relational or inter-family proximity, and attitudes towards aging. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, \\"Communication phenomena that were positively correlated with measures of age salience were negatively related to relational closeness. Only one communication measure (grandparents talking about the past) moderated the relationship between quality of contact with grandparent and attitudes toward older people. Specific communicative dimensions emerged that warrant further investigation in this and other intergroup contexts.\\" Salience also from an applied communicative perspective plays an important role in our Consumer- Marketing world. In Gianluigi Guido's book, The Salience of Marketing Stimuli: an incongruity ‚Äì salience hypothesis on consumer awareness, \\"salience triggered by an external physical stimuli, like all marketing stimuli are before being internalized by consumers ‚Äì to explain and predict the conditions under which a marketing stimulus, is able to achieve its communication outcomes in term of processing and memory.\\" The book clearly defines the history of the definition of salience and the ambiguities of arriving at an accurate definition. It also utilizes various theories to best define salience in our marketing world. Of the many theories, Guido uses aspects of Incongruity theory, Schema theory and an information processing model referred to as the In-salience hypothesis emphasizes the nature of prominence of salience. Marketing plans have become quite intricate and detailed in many ways. Analysts and industry experts used a myriad of tools to collect information from would be customers, previous customers and others in order to fashion the sales message of a particular product. This level of detailed work has evolved over time, but in many ways the same resources and information are gathered and used to achieve result of a sale. The marketing strategy feeds into one of the final products most people get to experience: the commercial. The commercial embodies the elements of the marketing strategy in language, affective response, and attitude change. Marketing plans in the modern age also look at the international customer when creating plans and formulating strategy. \\"An evolutionary perspective of internationalization of the firm has been adopted by a number of authors in the areas of international economics and international management. The theory of the international product lifecycle, propounded by Vernon and others, identifies a number of phases in the internationalization process based on the location of production. In the initial phase, a firm exports to overseas markets from a domestic production base. As market potential builds up, overseas production facilities are established. Low cost local competition then enters the market, and ultimately exports to the home market of the initial entrant, thus challenging its international market position.\\" > \\"This model is part of wider Dichotic theory of salience, according to which > a stimulus is salient either when it is incongruent in a certain context to > a perceiver's schema, or when it is congruent in a certain context to a > perceiver's goal. According to the four propositions of the model, in- > salient stimuli are better recalled, affect both attention and > interpretation, and are moderated by the degree of perceivers' comprehension > (i.e., activation, accessibility, and availability of schemata), and > involvement (i.e., personal relevance of the stimuli). Results of two > empirical studies on print advertisements show that in-salient ad messages > have the strongest impact in triggering ad processing which, in turn, leads > to consumer awareness.\\" The field of marketing is continually being studied and researched. Anshular & Kumar, Williams & Schmidt, Holden, Kuznetsov & Whitelock, and Huang & Chan have researched and published works regarding the language of marketing. Although the research is ongoing and adaptive to the customer, the research has been able to study points of importance to the consumer. Marketing requires an approach that carefully designs messages (commercials), utilizing signs and symbols to resonate with a potential buyer or customer. Nike's swoosh, Michael Jordan's jump-man image, Ford/GMC Cadillac logos are all signs that most people can quickly grab and discern the message being laid out. In the world of marketing having this power and ability lends a significant edge in comparison to the competition. Van Der Lans, Pieters, and Wedel write based on their research: > \\"We estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual > features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by > consumers‚Äô search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive > effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The > bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top- > down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as > advertising.\\" Using computer based langue to design extraction tools as part of the user experiences. Language errors that exists in projects can be passed on and further create issues for the next group. From this view issues to be fixed, ID‚Äôd and solutions set up to combat such issues. In the IT world, coding language is very important and therefore errors must be monitored well throughout the process. Internet Alcohol Vendors unlike traditional brick and mortar stores are established to reach a wider market. With this intent state officials and competitors have both started cases in court as further regulating the practice of internet alcohol sales. Internet sales give buyers reduced discounts in many forms while offering very little in security and accountability. The case brought against the industry favored further regulation keying in on individuals underage age having access to and buying alcohol online. The courts pushed back against the plaintiff lacking substantial information to make the case. The marketing language used was focused on reduced taxes based on quantity purchased and reduced or zero fees for shipping. Customers were connected to this message and therefore drawn to the product and made significant purchases. Russian viewpoint of marketing focused on the battle against capitalism, the west and specifically USA. Marketing language focused on the economics of each nation and how to improve it in an ever-changing world. Marketing was studied in the west by Russian students and translated for Russians to understand. Bad language came from translators who took artistic leisure with the material. Based on this context things were changed and missed when information was being relayed created huge shifts in understanding of the original material. The difference between the English alphabet and Chinese logographical system offer a unique challenge in brand creation, marketing and language. The article touches on how unique messages have to be crafted without simply translating. The Chinese language and system of writing is over 35,000 years old and not as easily bent or flexed to make easily pronounced phrases both in sound and linguistic prowess. Marketing in china is affected my culture and language equally. Crafting an effective strategy requires adherence and understanding of all factors. Therefore, to define salience as appropriate as possible using the information, it would be apt to define it such that, salience is that intrinsic concept of the perceived or interpreted prominence of an attitude, and its manifestation on our choices. Salience in marketing based on the research reviewed, can be categorized as a stimulus quality. What that means is the customers‚Äô needs have to be calculated and adjusted towards through the entire planning and execution of the plan. The overall goal of the messenger should be to create a message which adapts to the customer's affective responses, rewarding it with more info, then finally providing a product which would best arrive at the predetermined feel. Most consumers when asked about a marketing campaign are able to identify it clearly from the point of view of a commercial. These commercials capture the essence of the message being sent to all recipients. Products such as make up, cars, clothing, coffee, food, shoes etc. are all designed to create and provide an affective reaction from the recipient. The process of engaging with the customer seeks a cognitive connection. Customers will have to be grouped based on the item in order to predict affective responses. With this in mind, the focus is placed on imagery, affective responses from the consumer. How does this make you feel, do you empathize, how would you feel about using this product, etc. Marketing messages that have a significant affective component are able to connect better with people and yield greater outcome. Identity salience can affect the consumer. This display can be explain using \\"Identity theory posits that identities are arranged hierarchically and that salient identities are more likely to affect behavior than those that are less important. We propose that identity salience may play an important role in relationships that are distinguished by a minimum of two characteristics. First, though most theoretical and empirical research in relation-ship marketing focuses on characteristics of successful business-to-business relationships, such as trust and commitment (Morgan and Hunt 1994), many exchange relationships involve individuals. It is not unusual for organizations to attempt to develop long-term relationships with consumers on an individual basis. We argue that in contexts in which one partner is an individual, for example, business-to consumer marketing, identity salience may be an important construct that mediates relationship-inducing factors, such as reciprocity and satisfaction, and relationship marketing success.\\" Identity gets tied to brands, products and places for some people. There are generations of family sports team supporters, airline users, vacation goings and even restaurant patrons. These key items become a foundation block of self-identification and perception. The vehicle industry uses certain symbols as part of its marketing campaign. Most of these are touched on from different manufacturers in their efforts to win over customers. These are also common messages points that are used to make the sale and acquire the vested interest of the customer. For e.g. comfort (leather seating), roominess (cabin space), reliability, safety, performance, on/off-road handling, award winner by category, insurance companies or other entity. The best part of all the campaign is the dealership experience. This experience is the affective piece of the process. The initial being cognitive and schema connection, followed by the affective which aims at nudging the customer towards affirming the purchase. Customer attitudes can be influenced by a myriad of variables, therefore the marketing campaign is aimed at skewing enough of those variables towards to nearest dealer or once most capable of making the sale. \\"Specifically, research on behavioral synchrony suggests that people express greater feelings of attraction when they share their visual gazes, body postures (Chartrand & Lakin,2013), and more recently, their language style in writing or speech (Ireland & Pennebaker,2010).\\" Salience as a stimulus quality is a significant piece of the marketing, sales and commercial strategy. Manufacturers use celebrities, athletes, and other professionals as a way of drawing your attention to their product through stimulus. When it comes to car buying, many people refer to a past memory, this stimuli is different with each person but overall the quality and richness of that response is what connects to the brand in a way nothing else does. Care makers go through periods of recycling pieces of nostalgia to connect new drivers to those of yesteryear. Granpa is able to drive his mustang next to a grandson who favors the new model with a few modifications. A suit maker is able to dress members of the same family for 3 generations and just as many weddings and formal events. The stimulus quality is the strongest connection between all these events and the company or product creator able to take advantage of this, is most likely to achieve success. \\"Research concerning stimulus characteristics, which include information content and format, suggests that consumers utilize more nutrition information when it Is presented in an easily processed form (Levy et al. 1985; Muller 1985; Russo et al. 1986; Scammon 1977).(Moorman, 1990)\\" Stimulus qualities continually change and therefore needs to be studied and adaptations made in order to attain the best marketing end results. Cultural viewpoints of marketing and advertising is important across industries in many parts of the world. In the US alcohol sales are restricted to individuals ages 21 and greater, that rule isn't universal and some in nations around the world are trying to cope with the effects of marketing and ad campaigns (O‚ÄôBrian & Carr 2016).\\" Marketing messages are important based on the roles of the recipient. In the example of a mom she‚Äôs expected to judge the quality of goods and purchase based on the needs of children even though the good may not directly be marketed to and for her. \\"Noting the incongruence between the self-interested, utility maximizing persona one is expected to portray in the workforce, and the selfless, nurturing persona widespread among mothers, Hays argues that the latter identity in fact reveals a deep-seated cultural ambivalence towards economistic principles and behaviours.\\" le form schema based on social norms and roles. These roles are enforced individual beliefs and boosts perceptions is supposed to be doing, sometimes those expectations hold true and in others it doesn't. Social identity theory has been used while creating marketing strategies regarding women. Marketing strategies with products aimed at women should have like minds as part of the planning and creative process. Women across cultures and backgrounds experience similar stimuli but not on the same wave. Products like shoes, makeup, clothing and others geared specifically for women have messages focused on stimuli response of \\"feel good\\". Moms receive and are sent messages of safety and security of their children, a measure of style and the look and presentation of a strong woman. Marketing towards men are designed to inspire the feel of strength, leadership, vision, connection to nature, and feeling of ruggedness. The Language used in marketing is important because it is potentially the most important reason why someone makes a purchase/acquires a product. Research has shown that analytics aren't always the best predictor of sales or consumer connection with a product. Social identity theory can be used to evaluate the roles of individuals while creating the strategy. Depending on this solely will lead one astray without the addition of other pieces of information. Shema allows the consumer to receive each detail of a commercial/ad campaign in a way that energizes particular stimuli and therefore puts each person into the \\"driver seat\\" of an experience. The cognitive perspective spells out information which must be received, processed and analyzed and solutions south. Salience in marketing searches for the affective or stimulus response. A combination of efforts which both harvests information and processes it carefully if very important. Things such as age group, buying power, shopping frequency, socioeconomic status are all important. Once a product is created and during its testing phase the response which users and customers alike will be its feel. In the new age of tech data, appliances and complex machinery, marketing will still need to focus its efforts on such products and how consumer stimuli reacts to the product. The best engineers can create something that's amazing with all its bells and whistles, but its up to the perception of the customer to evaluate its usefulness and fit into his/her lifestyle. The growing tech industry with the power of achievement is quickly advancing virtual reality. VR can be experienced in the home without leaving to try or test any product prior to purchase. \\"The mural isn't just about aesthetics. Visitors will be instructed via signs to download an app to view the mural's augmented reality features. Downloading the app will also unlock a special coupon at The Elephant Room. It's a marketing tactic that Moody believes can drive foot traffic to the bar.\\" With this power marketing analysts and executives can craft messages and commercial aimed at each person with a unique and authentic feel. Information and data points are being collected and tested now. Video games offer a chance into the virtual world medical training and some groups in government and the military are adopting the technology to better achieve results. Crafting the message and spreading it out the masses will take less effort in the future, messages can be adapted to fit all manner of permutations each person may have. There may finally be an era of error free messaging with a direct link into the internet, show rooms of fashion designers, engineers at car factories and all other sorts of products. Testing in the virtual world would be far less tasking on legions of people. Humans in general respond greatly to stimuli and we offer this through the reactions generated. Marketing lends help in this manner by studying the patterns of behavior and crafting products for sale. The messaging is not always clear, succinct, and wide reaching. Research is still ongoing regarding how best to reach the customer in order to pitch and complete a sale. Those who are successful have crafted tools to help measure key things like salience in messaging and reaction to products. In the new age, the data collected will be very important while outfitting each member of the consuming public. Being able to craft a message or medium that can quickly adapt to each person virtually is of great importance. Online markets are gaining followership daily as more money spending moves to the digital realm. Perception and reception of the message is still the single most important part of any marketing strategy and should not be treated lightly. References =Bibliography= * Crano, W. D. (1995).

It is designed to accept different tools depending on the required function. Function Tools The following are various tools that can be used in the air hammer: ;Universal joint and tie-rod tool: Used to separate universal joints and tie-rod ends. ;Ball joint separator: Used to separate ball joints. ;Shock absorber chisel: Used to break loose shock absorber nuts. ;Exhaust pipe cutter: Used to cut through exhaust pipe for disassembly. ;Tapered punch: A general tool that can be used to free frozen nuts, insert pins, and align holes. ;Rubber bushing splitter: Used to remove rubber bushings. Free-standing style Free-standing air hammers are an adaptation of the hand-held version. An air hammer can stretch or shrink (shape) a variety of metals, from thin aircraft aluminums, all the way down to 10-gauge steel. They are also used for smoothing metal that has already been roughed, shaped or formed.White, Kent. \\"Pneumatic Power Shapes Sheet,\\" Home Shop Machinist magazine, Vol. 26, No.3, Jun 2007 History In the 1920s, two pneumatic devices were invented that would permanently change the way metal and stone were hammered. The pneumatic rivet gun was originally developed to set hot rivets on girder bridges and high steel buildings. This tool was later scaled down for sheet metal, as the 1930s saw the advent of monocoque aluminum aircraft. The other new device, hitting at twice or three times the speed of the rivet gun, was the stone carver's hammer ‚Äì a great blessing for smooth and rapid dressing of granite and marble. In 1930 F.J. Hauschild adapted the original stone carver's hammer into a portable hand-held steel tube frame for the purpose of straightening auto bodies. For the next 25 years his \\"Ram's Head Body and Fender Machine\\" improved and increased production for auto body work men all over the U.S. Copying Hauschild‚Äôs patented design, a pneumatic tool company in Chicago marketed a number of \\"destined-to-be-classic\\" pneumatic planishing hammers, both hand-held for auto body work, and also free-standing ones, with a variety of throat depths for industry and manufacturing.White, Kent, \\"Pneumatic Power Shapes Metal,\\" Home Shop Machinist Magazine, Bonus Issue, June 2007, Village Press. By World War II, rivet guns were used widely in U.S. aircraft factories both for riveting aluminum sheets, and for flow forming, the process of working aluminum sheet into and over wooden forms by the application of the pneumatic rivet gun. Post-war industry brought many new applications for the \\"air hammer\\" technology. Among these were: * sand rammers and tampers for sand casting metal * plating rack scalers * weld chippers * destruction guns for cleaning up concrete * needle scalers * pavement breakers * metal chisels. Each of these tools has a different purpose despite nearly identical appearance in many cases.

It also features John Rhys-Davies, Alyssa Milano, and Spalding Gray in supporting roles. The plot concerns five college housemates in Santa Cruz, California who are facing graduation and make an attempt to prolong their carefree lifestyle before going their separate ways. Matthew McConaughey, Meredith Salenger, Matt Damon, Brendan Fraser, and Leah Remini all appear in minor roles. Music for the film was composed and selected by members of the punk rock band The Vandals, and the soundtrack features several punk rock bands of the era. Plot A scene early in the film was shot at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, with the actors riding various attractions. 22 year-old Jack Freeman is graduating from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in art, and is hurting from a recent breakup with his ex-girlfriend Dina. He shares a house called \\"El Rancho\\" with four friends: Rob is also graduating, and preparing to move to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Joanie, though he is worried about settling down and living so close to Joani's mother. Dennis is a perpetual student with three degrees who, after six years at UCSC, is moving on to an MBA program in Michigan. Mickey is a cartoonist with a year of college still to go, and has feelings for their friend Chelsea but is too shy to reciprocate her affections. Josh, aka \\"Slosh\\", had a promising academic future but failed out of college in favor of a life of drinking and working a series of menial jobs. Art professor Luther criticizes Jack's final sculpture project for expressing an uninteresting, suburban, middle-class worldview, but praises Dennis' thesis‚Äîa photo-essay of Slosh getting drunk and working at dead-end jobs‚Äîand offers him an apprenticeship; Jack suggests that this is only because Luther has a homosexual attraction toward Dennis, a notion Dennis dismisses. Not wanting their college days to end, Jack convinces his friends to postpone their respective plans and stay at El Rancho for another year. They celebrate the decision by throwing a party, at which Chelsea, tired of her feelings for Mickey going unrequited, makes sexual advances toward Jack. He turns her down, and she leaves the party embarrassed. Rob gets into an argument with Joanie, causing her to leave angrily. After the commencement ceremony the next day, Rob reconciles with Joanie and meets her mother, and they end up getting along. Jack argues with his parents over his future, and they leave abruptly. Jack encourages Mickey to pursue a relationship with Chelsea. Luther makes a pass at Dennis during a faculty luncheon, confirming Jack's suspicion about his ulterior motives. Dennis and Jack vent their frustrations with Luther by cutting down a totem pole that his sculpture students spent two semesters creating. At a beach bonfire that night, Slosh tells Jack that it was Jack's carefree attitude that inspired him to give up on college, and that he does not regret his decision because he no longer fears what the future may hold. At Slosh's encouragement, Jack attempts to win back Dina, but she rebuffs him. Back at El Rancho, Mickey admits his feelings to Chelsea, and the two share a kiss. Jack and the others realize that they should not really stay another year, that it is time to move on with their adult lives. To preserve their memories of the house and prevent any future residents from despoiling it, they proceed to smash their furniture and belongings, culminating in the destruction of the bar counter that they had built together. The next day, the five friends go their separate ways: Rob leaves for Los Angeles with Joanie, Dennis heads off to school in Michigan, and Mickey and Chelsea begin dating. Slosh moves in with a group of new students he has befriended, and hangs the El Rancho sign on their house. As Jack leaves town, he stops at a restaurant where Dina is eating with her new boyfriend, and writes \\"angst for the memories\\" on the window as a farewell message to her.

The theatrical film poster, however, advertised Affleck, Milano, and Stewart as the film's stars. Meredith Salenger is also credited with a \\"special appearance\\" as a fan of Mickey's comic strip. Several actors who later became stars in their own right had small roles in Glory Daze, including Matthew McConaughey as a rental truck salesman, Matt Damon in a non-speaking role as former El Rancho housemate Edgar Pudwhacker, and Brendan Fraser and Leah Remini as a couple who Jack argues with on a bus. Other small roles were played by Sean Whalen as a flunky, Jay Lacopo as the bus driver, and Alfred Sole as a fisherman. Music Warren Fitgerald (left) of The Vandals composed the score for Glory Daze. His bandmate Joe Escalante (right) supervised the music. They released the soundtrack album through their record label, Kung Fu Records. The musical score for the film's soundtrack was composed by Warren Fitzgerald, guitarist of the punk rock band The Vandals. Vandals bassist Joe Escalante served as music supervisor, along with Lia Vollack. The Vandals performed original music for the film score, including the \\"Theme from Glory Daze\\" which plays during the opening credits. \\"It's a Fact\\", from their then- upcoming album The Quickening, was included, and a music video was later released for the song featuring clips from the film. The soundtrack also features several other contemporary punk rock bands, mostly from California, including NOFX, Bad Religion, Tilt, The Mr. T Experience, Assorted Jelly Beans, The Bouncing Souls, and the New Bomb Turks. Members of the cast and crew also contributed to the soundtrack. The song \\"Sports Pack\\" is sung by Vinnie DeRamus, who played Mickey, with writer and director Rich Wilkes on drums along with bassist Scott Marcano and a guitarist credited as \\"Gold\\"; for the soundtrack album they used the group name Epoxy. In the film's party scene, the El Rancho housemates' band perform two songs: The \\"Dudes of Steel Theme\\" with Rob singing, and a cover version of The Mr. T Experience's \\"Now We Are Twenty-One\\" with Slosh singing. Sam Rockwell and Vien Hong sang their respective characters' parts on these tracks (DeRamus also sang backing vocals on \\"Now We Are Twenty-One\\"), while the music was performed by Daniel Rey, Roger Murdock, and John Connor. =Soundtrack album= The soundtrack album for Glory Daze was released by Kung Fu Records, Escalante and Fitzgerald's recently launched independent record label. The album includes two songs not used in the film: \\"Joe Lies (When He Cries)\\" by The Bouncing Souls, and the previously-unreleased Vandals song \\"Change the World with My Hockey Stick\\". Also, rather than the original Bad Religion version of \\"We're Only Gonna Die\\" used in the film, the album substitutes a live recording of a cover version performed by Sublime. Other songs used in the film but not included on the soundtrack album include \\"Kill All the White Man\\" by NOFX, \\"Clown Show\\" by Ednaswap, \\"She Ballin by Chappie Chap, and \\"Acetone\\" by Mudhoney. Track listing Reception Reviewing the film in November 1995, when it was titled Last Call, Variety senior critic Emanuel Levy criticized Wilkes' direction as \\"awkward, lacking any visual flair\\" and said that \\"the movie makes its funny points early on, which means the second half is basically an elaboration. If the loose, anecdotal pic sometimes rambles and loses its main line, eventually it rights itself, with enough inventiveness and fresh, nasty humor to compensate for the dull moments.\\" Upon its theatrical release, Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave Glory Daze a positive review, saying \\"This tiny nostalgic comedy, with its smart collegiate chatter, is a much better movie than slick fatuities like The Jerky Boys (1995), Airheads (1994), and Billy Madison (1995), for which Mr. Wilkes wrote the screenplays. Of course that isn't saying much. But Glory Daze deftly sketches each member of its underachieving fivesome while sustaining a mood of humorously frazzled end-of-semester anxiety [...] Mr. Affleck's affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack. Even though he thoroughly deserves every comeuppance, you still have to sympathize with the poor guy.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, saying that it \\"doesn't cover any ground that wasn't already plowed and sprayed in previous slacker comedies\\" and that \\"there's no shape to the movie and no rhythm connecting the scenes to each other. Wilkes has a gift for nasty put-down lines, but his directing debut lacks heart and his leading man isn't a tad sympathetic ‚Äì or even slightly redeemed by Affleck's sour performance.\\" Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner was also critical of it, calling it \\"another cynical movie about people in their 20s who don't know what to do with their lives [...] Writer-director Rich Wilkes doesn't insert much substance into the movie, but he does take the opportunity to make fun of art education. Jack's professor (John Rhys-Davies) tells him Jack's project has gotten 'lost in abstractionism'. 'Real art is subject to a complex filtration system', he goes on. 'I look at your stuff and I see 20th century American suburbia. It doesn't resonate.' Just the way I feel about this movie.\\" Joey O'Bryan of The Austin Chronicle also criticized Glory Daze, calling it \\"insipid [...] a loving, if not particularly funny, tribute to the slob-comedies of the Eighties, or, in other words, it's an Animal House (1978) wannabe with a condescending Gen-X slant [...] the film's sense of social satire is hopelessly pedestrian, the dialogue stale ('He changed his major more often than his underwear'), and the editing is amateurish, with many scenes beginning too late and ending too early.\\" Reviewing the DVD release of the film in 2002, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club compared it unfavorably to 1995's Kicking and Screaming, calling it \\"a considerably weaker variation on the same themes [...] Glory Daze is not a good movie, but it does illustrate some of the frustrating clich√©s that the Gen Angst genre has accumulated in the nearly four years since Reality Bites (1994) appeared.\\" References External links  Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:1995 comedy films Category:1995 films Category:American comedy films Category:1995 independent films ","title":"Glory Daze (film)"},{"id":"2094972","text":"The Rudelsburg is a ruined hill castle located on the east bank of the river Saale above Saaleck, a village in the borough of Naumburg in the county of Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The Rudelsburg was built in the Middle Ages by the Bishop of Naumburg and served to secure trade routes such as the Via Regia through the Saale Valley. The Rudelsburg was a point of conflict between the bishops of Naumburg and the Margraves of Meissen belonging to the House of Wettin. The castle occasionally served various noble families as a residence, until it was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War and thereafter fell into disrepair. In the early 19th century the Rudelsburg became a popular tourist destination thanks to the romanticisation of mountains and the rise of hiking as a pastime. From 1855 onwards it achieved national renown as the annual meeting place of the K√∂sener Senioren-Convents- Verband, the oldest union of student fraternities with delegates from all German-speaking countries. The Rudelsburg still maintains a particular attraction for visitors and lies on the Romanesque Road (Ger:Stra√üe der Romanik), a tourist route. Geography Rudelsburg sits atop a rocky shell limestone ridge, approximately above the river Saale and above Saaleck, a suburb of Bad K√∂sen in the Burgenlandkreis district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 2010, the area has been part of the municipality of Naumburg.  History  = Prehistory: Early Bronze Age settlement = Archaeological finds seem to indicate that an early Bronze Age settlement existed on the site of the Rudelsburg, which has been attributed to the Unetice culture. The discovery of the Nebra sky disk attracted public attention to this prehistoric civilisation and its elevated culture and provoked interest in the settlements in the region of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The political, religious and economic importance of such settlements has not yet been established, but is the focus of intense research. = Military fortification and seat of nobility = A well-known depiction with remains of the outer keep (before 1770) The Rudelsburg castle was established in 1050 as a border fortification and was extended around 1150, with the addition of the central and outer keeps. Not far away on the western knoll is the ruin of Saaleck Castle. Rudelsburg was officially mentioned for the first time in 1171 under the name Rutheleibisberg. Heinrich III, Margrave of Meissen, received the castle from the Bishop from Naumburg in 1238 as recompense for services to the church and installed there a number of families belonging to the nobility of service (retainers to a lord whose status was far above that of the peasantry but who nonetheless did not belong to the ranks of the high nobility). A source from 1271 names 12 different castellans. A priest is mentioned for the first time in 1293. During a dispute with the noble Curtefrund, the citizens of Naumburg led by their captain Johann von Trautzschen laid siege to the Rudelsburg from 22 April to 30 July 1348. The sources relate that an ‚Äúinstrumentum‚Äù was brought to bear during the siege that could shoot Greek fire.Pro Leipzig e.V. (ed.): Im Elsterland zwischen Zwenkau, Groitzsch und Pegau. In Zusammenarbeit mit den St√§dten Zwenkau, Groitzsch und Pegau hrsg. v. Pro Leipzig e.V., Leipzig 2002, p. 178 This must have been some early form of gunpowder and is thought to be one of the first records of the use of firearms in a siege in Germany. The only earlier recorded use of ordnance dates back to the siege of the town of Meersburg on Lake Constance by Ludwig von Bayern in 1334. The oldest reports in all of Europe are from Italy (Florence 1326, Cividale 1331) and from the French fleet (1338-1346). The citizens of Naumburg burnt down the Rudelsburg during their siege, and there were deaths and injuries on both sides. It seems that the castle was not rebuilt, as it is not mentioned in any official document for several decades after this event. The next mention of the castle dates to 1383, when the Schenk family from Saaleck belonging to the House of Vargula are named as masters of the citadel, seated in Rottelsburg. A loan certificate of the Dukes of Saxony, who belonged to the House of Wettin, dated 2 April 1441 names the brothers Rudolf, G√ºnther and Heinrich von B√ºnau as the owners of the Rudelsburg. Apparently they owned no land other than that on which the castle stood. During the fratricidal war between Friedrich and Wilhelm of Saxony, the Rudelsburg was besieged and destroyed for a second time in 1450. The inner keep was burnt to the ground during this incident. At the division of the lands of the House of Wettin in 1485, the Rudelsburg was attributed to the Albertine line. Rudolph von B√ºnau auf Teuchern and G√ºnther von B√ºnau auf Gr√∂bitz sold the Rudelsburg and the surrounding outworks to Hans Georg von Osterhausen in 1581 to cover their debts. The castle, which had been barely maintained until then, began to fall into decay during this period. Although Groitzsch still describes the Rudelsburg as arx pulcherrima (\\"most beautiful castle\\") in his 1585 work Descriptio Salae fluvii eidemque adjacentium urbium, arcium etc. (Description of the river Saale and the surrounding towns, castles, etc.), a record from 1612 indicates that the lord marshal of Osterhausen employed a stonemason and a carpenter to provide \\"necessary support of the sagging beams, girders and rafters\\". According to Osterhausen court records, a process was held at the Rudelsburg on 4 June 1616. At the time, a caretaker still lived in the castle, which was accessible via a narrow road. The courtyard was covered in grass. Besides a small room with a wooden pulpit, the usable remains of the castle included the dungeons with their very strong doors. Towards the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1640, Swedish troops set fire to the Rudelsburg. Following this third destruction, the Rudelsburg was abandoned on 14 April 1641 and the inhabitants moved to the nearby Kreipitzsch property. The nobles from Creutz(en) are believed to have been the owners of the Rudelsburg from 1671 to 1771. In 1690, they tried to establish the status of the (uninhabited) castle as a possession owing direct allegiance only to the emperor (Reichsunmittelbarkeit) in a court process in the imperial court in Wetzlar. In 1770, the owner of the Rudelsburg ordered that the walls of the outer keep be torn down in order to reuse the stones for construction on the property, but a worker was permanently injured in an accident, and this was interpreted as a bad omen. The work was stopped. The outer keep was almost completely destroyed at this point in time, and it is probably only as a result of this accident that the ruined inner keep was preserved. With the death of Friedrich Adolph von Creutz in 1774, the male line of the family was extinguished. This thwarted the plans to establish the Reichsunmittelbarkeit of the Rudelsburg. In the following years, the counts from Zech and the counts from Br√ºhl are named briefly as the owners of the Rudelsburg. The family von Sch√∂nberg bought the castle in 1797 and established an entailment, i.e. an indivisible trust that was designed to keep together the inheritance of the family. = The Rudelsburg as a destination for hikers and a tourist attraction = 1849: Inner courtyard of the Rudelsburg with the first Rudelsburg innkeeper Gottlieb ‚ÄúSamiel‚Äù Wagner, to the left in the picture is the provisional straw roof that existed until 1853 In the 19th century, the Rudelburg became a meeting point for romantically-minded hikers, especially for students from Jena, Leipzig and Halle. By this time, the castle was desolate, and devoid of all infrastructure. There was no entrance into the courtyard of the central keep and there were no sealed rooms, just rubble and debris. In 1818, the cantor emeritus, Johann Friedrich F√∂rtsch, described the Rudelsburg as follows: ‚ÄúThe inner courtyard is covered in the rubble of the various ceremonial halls, chambers, weapon and storage rooms, kitchens, underground vaults, cellars and corridors, which have collapsed. It is thus impossible to say how everything used to be arranged.‚Äù Nonetheless, ever more visitors came to the Rudelsburg. During the same period, the masters of the castle belonging to the family of the barons von Sch√∂nberg planted grapevines on the southern slope of the hill. One of the former vineyard workers, Gottlieb Wagner, known as ‚ÄúSamiel‚Äù, began to look after the ruins. From 1824 onwards, he offered food and drink from the Kreipitzsch property to visitors. Franz Kugler Franz Kugler, a student from Stettin studying in Berlin, composed the famous song An der Saale hellem Strande (On the bright bank of the Saale) whilst resting at the castle during a hike along the river in 1826: {  :On the bright bank of the Saale :stand castles proud and bold, :their roofs have fallen, :and the wind blows through the halls, :clouds float overhead.  } 1856: Courtyard of the Rudelsburg with the drinking hall built in 1853 In this song, the castles on the Saale are decaying ruins that serve only to inspire the imagination. There is as yet no mention of drinking and celebrations or of the Rudelsburg as a venue for events. The attractiveness of the castle rose however with the services offered by Wagner, so much so that the head of the district authorities in Naumburg asked Friedrich von Sch√∂nberg, the owner of the property, if it would be possible to open it officially for visitors. Consequently, a road was even built up to the castle. Gottlieb Wagner opened the first tavern in the castle in time for Easter 1827, although it was only open on Sundays at first. When word got around about this development amongst the students in Jena, they marched on the Rudelsburg and, cheering loudly, occupied it for three days. The owner of the castle was honoured with a torchlight procession. The completion of the Thuringian Railway in 1849, which improved the access to the Rudelsburg, coupled with the gastronomic offerings, further increased the attractiveness of the castle and brought in visitors from further abroad, including for example students from Leipzig and Halle an der Saale. During a large-scale Prussian military exercise in the area in 1853, the provincial classes invited King Frederick William IV to breakfast at the castle. The drinking hall in the inner courtyard, which was built in the same year, is probably a product of this visit. The hall took the form of a roofed seating area that was open to the courtyard and replaced the old straw roof that had been held up by simple tree trunks. = The Rudelsburg as a venue and a symbol for students = Hermann Allmers In 1863, Hermann Allmers from Rechtenfleth near Bremen composed the student song Dort Saaleck, hier die Rudelsburg (There Saaleck, here the Rudelsburg). Although Allmers was himself not a student, he traveled with students in the Saale valley, and his song speaks of the new life within the walls of the castle. {  :There Saaleck, here the Rudelsburg, :and deep down in the valley :splashing between rocks :the dear old Saale; :and mountains here and mountains there, :to the right and to the left - :: The Rudelsburg, that is a place :for feasting and for drinking. :  :They know this too :the students in Jena and in Halle :and they drink there in the old way, :in the yard and on the wall. :surrounded by mossy stone, :how the songs sound so fine! :: The Saale splashes so happily, : the mountains echo. :  } In the middle of the 19th century, the Rudelsburg became a regular meeting point for students‚Äô corps, whose umbrella organisation the K√∂sener Senioren-Convents- Verband (KSCV) had been founded in Jena in 1848, making it the oldest union of German student fraternities. The site of the KSCV‚Äôs annual meeting was soon moved to Bad K√∂sen, and a meeting took place in the Rudelsburg for the first time in 1855. From this time until World War I, the Rudelburg served every year as a social meeting point during the annual meeting in Bad K√∂sen. (Re-)construction under the Empire  The Pillar to the Fallen at the Rudelsburg in 1872; lithograph after a drawing by Oskar Mothes In 1867, following the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the restoration of the Wartburg, discussions began as to whether the Rudelsburg should also be restored. These discussions were further provoked by a storm in December 1868, which brought down parts of the perimeter walls. Work to restore the perimeter walls in the west and in the south began in 1870. The partial reconstruction of the castle began a year later under the leadership of the master builder, Werner, from Bad K√∂sen, using plans drawn up by the royal building officer in Saxony, Oskar Mothes. During these works, the entrance and the bridge were repaired. The knight‚Äôs hall with its staircase and side room were restored. A large breach in the wall was closed in the north-eastern corner and windows were cut in the old northern wall. A canon that had been captured in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War was placed on the bridge. These works were complete by Easter 1872. In 1872, the first monument erected by members of the students‚Äô corps was unveiled. The Gefallenens√§ule (English: Pillar to the Fallen) was established in honour of those members who had fallen in the Franco-Prussian War. The Emperor William I Obelisk was unveiled in 1890, followed in 1896 by the Young Bismarck Memorial. The last of this first round of monuments was erected in 1926 in honour of those who fell in World War I. (See below: Monuments) The courtyard of the Rudelsburg, Gottlieb Wagner is in the foreground with a beer mug in his hand; wood carving after a drawing by Oskar Mothes around 1872. The partial reconstruction by Mothes, the founding of the German Empire in 1871 and the erection of the monuments in the area near the outer keep marked a completely new phase in the history of the Rudelsburg. While youthful appreciation of nature and the romantic scenery had been pivotal in the first half of the century, the Rudelsburg now became a symbol for the members of the KSCV. The KSCV was a strong ally of the state, which was reinforced by the membership of both of the most important political decision-makers of the time, Otto von Bismarck and Emperor Wilhelm II. With the founding of the Verband Alter Corpsstudenten (English: Federation of old members), the KSCV, which had until then only counted students amongst its members, had a new source of income in the form of contributions from the ‚Äúold men‚Äù. The Rudelsburg became a platform for celebrations of the KSCV‚Äôs new self-confidence. As a consequence, the annual meeting at the Rudelsburg became more sedate and ceremonial. Speeches held at the monuments and patriotic songs were fixtures in the annual Pentecost programme in the German Empire. In the Empire and the Weimar Republic, life-size copies of the Rudelsburg monuments were made and sold to interested buyers in Germany and Austria. In 2007, these laboriously produced objects are still to be found from time to time in antique shops. In 1913, Paul Schreckenbach wrote the historical novel The last Rudelsburger, which is set in the 14th century and which reflects the conservative Prussian values of his time.  Weimar Republic and National Socialism  Notgeld issued by the town of Bad K√∂sen in 1921 with the Rudelsburg and students There were no student meetings at the Rudelsburg during World War I, but the tradition was restarted after the end of the war. In 1926, the L√∂wendenkmal (English: Lion Monument) was unveiled with great pomp. This ceremony was seen as a symbol of the members of the students‚Äô corps attachment to the old imperial system and was reported throughout Germany and beyond. The last meeting of the KSCV at the Rudelsburg before World War II took place in 1934. The 1935 congress ended with the dissolution of the group by the National Socialists. During World War II, there were efforts at some universities to re-establish individual student bodies in secret. These were to include the umbrella organisation, the KSCV. To this end, a meeting was organised at the Rudelsburg in 1944, which ended with a ceremonial drinking session. Because of the chaos in the last months of the war, neither this new founding nor the attraction of the Gestapo‚Äôs attention had serious consequences for those involved. After the end of World War II, the Rudelsburg was part of the Soviet occupation zone and later the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The owner, a member of the nobility, lost his possessions, and the castle was attributed to the town of Bad K√∂sen.  In the GDR  Invitation to the ceremonial drinking session of the GDR student fraternities at the Rudelsburg in 1988 The student organisations which found themselves on the territory of the GDR moved to the west. The KSCV‚Äôs congress was held from 1954 to 1994 in W√ºrzburg, near to the Fortress Marienberg. The Rudelsburg and Bad K√∂sen were but a memory for the members of the students‚Äô corps. The Rudelsburg decayed further during this time, as did the monuments that had been erected there. Some larger metal pieces were melted down and reused. As it was common to take the names of tourist attractions to designate products produced in a particular area, the name ‚ÄúRudelsburg‚Äù was used to name a car radio produced in the state-owned radio factory in Halle and various products produced in the equally state-owned limestone factory in Bad K√∂sen. GDR post stamp from 1961 showing the Rudelsburg The first attempts to revive the old student traditions began in the GDR in the 1960s. Much however had already been forgotten, and information and materials first had to be collected in secret. In the early years of the 1980s, the first new fraternities in the GDR were founded, at first secretly and then ever more openly. The Rudelsburg and other traditional meeting points featured in the plans of the GDR students. On 20 June 1987, the fraternity Salana Jenensis organised the first ceremonial drinking session of the GDR student fraternities at the Rudelsburg. At the first such meeting, just 19 participants were present, some of whom had arrived by using rafts or bath tubs made of zinc to travel along the Saale. This was to be a reference to the tradition of boat trips on the Saale which can be seen in many old depictions. This ceremonial drinking session was the first officially registered traditional student meeting in the history of the GDR. From this year on, the Rudelsburg was the annual meeting point for the student fraternities which had been founded in the GDR before 1990. In 1990, they joined together in the Rudelsburg Alliance.  Reconstruction after German Reunification  The courtyard today In 1990 (sometimes even before German Reunification), the first student bodies began to return to their old university towns in the GDR. The first congress took place in Bad K√∂sen in 1995. The Rudelsburg was once again put to use for this purpose, which required extensive work to restore the castle. Bad K√∂sen‚Äôs infrastructure also had to be upgraded, for the congress was now much larger than it had even been before the war. The monuments at the Rudelsburg have also been successively restored since unification. These works have been financed by the KSCV, with donations from individual student bodies, but also with donations from individual members. The song Dort Saaleck, hier die Rudelsburg is still used by members of both the KSCV and the Rudelsburg Alliance. The Rudelsburg still hosts a restaurant. The inner area of the castle and the donjon are accessible during the opening hours of the restaurant and visitors have a view of the Saale valley from the donjon. In the lower rooms of the donjon, there are display windows with exhibits about the student organisations. So that weddings may take place there, there is a civil registry office in the castle. The town Bad K√∂sen and the surrounding districts now market the castle as part of the ‚ÄúThuringian Toscana‚Äù, including the nature reserve Saale-Unstrut- Triasland. Pillar to the Fallen Alliance Stone at the Rudelsburg Description View of the castle from the Saale valley =Architecture= Defensive structures of the Rudelsburg: corner towers (a, b, c), palisades (zz), gate tower (t), ditch (D), remains of the outer keep (V) Floor plan of the Rudelsburg from 1879 The Rudelsburg was constructed in the Middle Ages with a central ward divided into several sections and surrounded by an outer ward. The stones of the outer ward were largely reused in the 18th century and it is no longer recognisable; only parts of the wall in the east and south are still there. The outer ward was unusual to the extent that it was built higher up than the central ward was. The central ward, which was separated from the ward keep by a deep encircling ditch, has a bergfried that is approximately high, a transverse rectangular great hall, several living quarters, and is surrounded by a circular wall. The courtyard is very small. The Romanesque bergfried is almost exactly square () and is topped with a pyramid-shaped tower roof made of stone, which gives the castle its characteristic appearance. There is a dungeon in the basement of the donjon. The outer palisades in the east were constructed in the 13th century, the other palisades and the circular corner towers were constructed in the 15th century. The Rudelsburg palisade, which is located between the central and outer keeps, was obviously envisaged during the construction of the castle and is seen as proof that the idea of palisades did not first arrive in Europe as a result of the Crusades. Because of its position atop a steep cliff above the Saale, the western side of the castle was the hardest to attack. It is protected only by the circular wall and the great hall is also located on this side. The northern circular wall was not built on the very edge of the cliff, in contrast to the practice elsewhere in Europe. This was presumably done so as to avoid the wall collapsing if a section of the fragile limestone were to break off. The wall is set back about , which made the later addition of an advanced corner tower on the north-east side necessary in order to prevent potential enemies from advancing onto this ledge. The southern side, which is only protected by a small valley, has an additional palisade, which is flanked by two corner towers. The strongest corner tower is on the south-east side. The eastern side looks to the outer keep and is protected by the ditch, a palisade and the donjon. At some point in time, a windmill was attached to one of the round castle towers. The windmill is shown in many depictions of the castle until the middle of the 19th century. It was destroyed by fire in 1864. = Monuments = In the course of time, many monuments have been erected at the Rudelsburg. Four important monuments have been put up just by the KSCV on the way from Bad K√∂sen to the Rudelsburg on the land formerly occupied by the outer keep. Pillar to the Fallen The K√∂sener Gefallenendenkmal (Pillar to the Fallen) was erected at Pentecost in 1872 in honour of the members of the students‚Äô corps who had fallen in the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War. The students put up this monument without the help of the ‚Äúold men‚Äù, whose federation had not yet been founded, and the Pillar was in fact the first monument ever erected by students in Germany. It consisted of a base with stairs, a platform with balustrade, a four-metre tall pedestal and a pillar topped by an imperial eagle with a crown. The monument was destroyed in 1953, under the GDR.  Emperor William I Obelisk  The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Obelisk (Emperor William I Obelisk) was unveiled on 25 May 1890. It honours the German Emperor, who died in 1888. It too was destroyed under the GDR, but was rebuilt following the reunification.  Young Bismarck Monument  The Young Bismarck Monument was the first project to be realised by the Verband Alter Corpsstudenten. It was erected in 1895-96 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Otto von Bismarck, himself an ‚Äúold man‚Äù of the Corps Hannovera G√∂ttingen. Of the countless Bismarck monuments erected in Germany, this was the only one that depicted the first Imperial Chancellor as a nonchalantly seated young man with the sash of his fraternity across his chest and a duelling sword in his hand. This portrayal of Bismarck in a casual stance provoked heated discussions, but had been approved by Bismarck himself on 27 April 1895. It is the work of sculptor Norbert Pfretzschner. This monument was destroyed under the GDR by the Free German Youth, but the foundation stone with inscriptions and Bismarck‚Äôs student hat was saved by members of East German student fraternities and handed over to the KSCV after Reunification. On 29 May 1998, members of the Corps Hannovera G√∂ttingen paid for a memorial to be erected on the site of the old Bismarck monument. A reproduction of the original monument was unveiled by the KSCV on 1 April 2006 in the presence of the Justice Minister of Saxony-Anhalt, Curt Becker. Andreas Belser from Traunstein was the responsible sculptor and the casting had been carried out by the firm Otto Strehle in Winh√∂ring near Alt√∂tting. Many members of the Corps Hannovera who had been involved in the realisation and financing of the reproduction were present at the ceremonial unveiling of the monument. The monument has however already been damaged by souvenir hunters or vandals.  Lion Monument  The L√∂wendenkmal (Lion Monument) was erected in 1926 in memory of the 2,360 members of the KSCV who had fallen in World War I. It shows in relief an oversized lion that has been pierced with lances and is dying. The Lion Monument was created by (1875‚Äì1958), a sculptor from Berlin. After the Reunification, the overgrown monument was restored and new plaques in memory of those who fell in both World Wars were added.  Alliance Stone  The Alliance Stone was erected at the Rudelsburg in 1997 by members of the Rudelsburger Alliance to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first official meeting of student fraternities in the GDR. An earlier stone made of concrete had been placed next to the Bismarck Monument in 1987. This ‚ÄúOld Alliance Stone‚Äù is still in its original place.

Plot Axel (Johnny Depp) has a dream about an Eskimo who catches a rare halibut and brings it back to his family in an igloo. Axel's cousin Paul (Vincent Gallo) coaxes Axel from his job tagging fish in New York City to Arizona to attend his uncle Leo's (Jerry Lewis) trophy wedding to a much younger woman (Paulina Porizkova). His uncle tries to persuade him to stay permanently and take over the family business of selling Cadillacs. Axel resists at first, but he decides to give it a try. Axel encounters two strange women: Elaine (Faye Dunaway), a woman who always had a dream of building a flying machine, and her stepdaughter Grace (Lili Taylor), who is jealous of Elaine and dreams of killing herself and being reincarnated as a turtle. Axel starts lusting after Elaine and decides to help make her dreams come true. As he and Elaine build the machine day by day, Grace starts destroying the contraption. Axel then rebuilds. Leo and Paul arrive at Elaine and Grace's house to encourage Axel to come back, but Elaine threatens them with a shotgun. Axel and Elaine complete the machine and test it, but it crashes in a tree. Axel then decides to put both Elaine and Grace out of their misery, but can not go through with it. Grace has the idea to play Russian Roulette with him. Axel is scared at first, but at his second turn he pulls the trigger multiple times. The gun does not fire. Axel, Elaine, and Grace come to Paul's talent show. He decides to play Cary Grant's role from North by Northwest with the famous crop duster scene. Paul receives the score of 1. Leo's fianc√©e then approaches them to say that there is something wrong with Leo. Axel realizes that Leo is dying and calls an ambulance but Leo dies. The day before Elaine's birthday a few months later, Axel and Paul finally come back to Elaine and Grace's house. Elaine is mad at Axel for not contacting her but forgives him. The next day on Elaine's birthday, Elaine is given an airplane as a present. The four celebrate Elaine's birthday by beating a pi√±ata, but are interrupted by a storm. As the others dry off inside, Grace remains outside to free her turtles, telling them to \\"Go play,\\" Axel goes upstairs with Grace to wrap the presents where she gives Axel a globe, telling him that she wants him to have the world. Axel tells Grace that Elaine has changed and that he is not in love with her any more. He makes a promise to Grace to go to Alaska. Axel, Elaine, Grace, and Paul talk about the manners in which they want to die. Grace says that she is going to sleep and walks upstairs, dressing herself in a white shift and a hat with a veil. As she walks outside, Axel and Elaine see her through the window and run outside in an attempt to stop her. Grace shoots herself, and a lightning bolt destroys Elaine's airplane. Sometime after Grace's death Axel breaks into Uncle Leo's abandoned Cadillac store at night and goes to sleep on top of a Cadillac with a cat that has just had her litter. The film ends with Axel and Uncle Leo as Eskimos in Axel's dream. They catch the halibut and discuss it. It flies from their hands into the sunrise.

It begins as Alberta Highway 2 at Mile Zero in Grimshaw, Alberta. After the first , it becomes Alberta Highway 35 for the balance of its length through Alberta and then becomes Northwest Territories Highway 1.  Route description  The Mackenzie Highway is designated as part of Canada's National Highway System, holding core route status from its terminus at Grimshaw to its intersection with the Yellowknife Highway, and northern/remote route status for the remainder of the route to its northern terminus at Wrigley. Originally begun in 1938, prior to World War II, the project was abandoned at the outbreak of war, then resumed in the late 1940s and completed to Hay River, Northwest Territories in 1948/1949, though some sections, particularly in the vicinity of Steen River, remained difficult. In 1960, it was extended from Enterprise, approximately south of Hay River, to the northwest, then north past Fort Providence to Behchoko (at the time, known as Rae-Edzo) and southeast to the City of Yellowknife, which became the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967. Much of this extension is now known as Northwest Territories Highway 3, the Yellowknife Highway. The stretch from Enterprise to Hay River is Northwest Territories Highway 2. In approximately 1970, the highway was extended west from what is now the southern terminus of Highway 3 to reach Fort Simpson, and in 1971, when the section to Fort Simpson was opened to traffic, work began to prepare a road grade from there to Wrigley, but the work was abandoned. This roadway, which starts at a junction from the island that \\"downtown\\" Fort Simpson is situated on, was finally made usable in 1994, and includes the N'dulee ferry and ice crossings. On November 8th 2013, the portion of the highway from the Alberta/Northwest Territories border to Enterprise was designated the Highway of Heroes. There are social and economic studies being done on the extension of the highway north from Wrigley to join the Dempster Highway; the N.W.T. government has completed 34 bridges across all but six of the widest river crossings, serving the ice road and awaiting the all-weather route.

About Pearl Curran  Curran was born Pearl Lenore Pollard in Mound City, Illinois. The family moved to Texas when she was eight months old and she started school when she was six. She was an average but uninterested student, eventually dropping out in her first high school year, later stating she had a nervous breakdown due to the strenuous academics. She later returned to classes at St. Ignatius Catholic school. Curran was sensitive about her looks, considering herself to be ugly. She admitted to having little imagination and few ambitions, except to be successful as a singer. She had a short attention span and read very little during her formative years. Her family moved to St. Louis when she was 14. She made a last attempt at attending school but was discouraged when placed in a lower grade based on her academic skills. However, she took music lessons, trained in piano and voice, and aspired to be a prima donna. About that time the family moved again, to Palmer, Missouri. As Curran's musical talents blossomed, she was sent to Kankakee, Illinois for voice training, before moving to Chicago for tuition from J.C. Cooper. She worked at the McKinley Music Company addressing envelopes for $6 a week, then the Thompson Music Company selling music. From the age of 18 to 24 she worked at assorted jobs in Chicago during winter months, and during the summer she taught music at home in Missouri. Pearl married John Howard Curran when she was 24. Though by no means wealthy, they lived a lifestyle which gave Pearl free time for moviegoing or playing cards with her husband or neighbors. The Currans had an average education for that time and owned few books; neither of them had traveled extensively. The first seven years of their marriage were uneventful.  The appearance of Patience Worth  Beginning in July 1912, Pearl Curran and her friend Emily Grant Hutchings were making a call on a neighbor who had a ouija board and during that call there came what purported to be a message from a relative of Mrs. Hutchings. Mrs. Hutchings then bought a ouija board and took it to Mrs. Curran's house with the idea of continuing the communications. Pearl was somewhat indifferent and had to be coaxed to participate at the board. On June 22, 1913 a communication from \\"Pat-C\\" began to come through. Then on July 8, 1913 the board seemed to be possessed with unusual strength and supposed communications from Patience Worth began. \\"Many moons ago I lived. Again I come. Patience Worth my name. Wait, I would speak with thee. If thou shalt live, then so shall I. I make my bread at thy hearth. Good friends, let us be merrie. The time for work is past. Let the tabby drowse and blink her wisdom to the firelog.\\" When asked when she lived, the dates 1649‚Äì94 were given and that her home was \\"Across the sea\\". Although Worth indicated that she was from England, she never named the town or village in which she lived. She did give some clues which were deduced by Casper Yost and other intimates of the Currans to indicate that Patience Worth had lived in rural Dorsetshire with her father John and mother Anne. Curran had a mental picture of the place in which Patience Worth lived indicating that Patience lived in \\"...green rolling country with gentle slopes, not farmed much, with houses here and there. Two or three miles up this country on this road was a small village ---few houses.\\" Mrs. Curran then visualized Patience leaving for America on a huge wood, three-masted schooner. Patience was described by Mrs. Curran as \\"...probably about thirty years. Her hair was dark red, mahogany, her eyes brown, and large and deep, her mouth firm and set, as though repressing strong feelings. Her hair had been disarranged by her cap, and was in big, glossy, soft waves.\\" Mrs. Curran also saw Patience \\"sitting on a horse, holding a bundle tied in sail-cloth, tied with thongs and wearing a coarse cloth cape, brown-gray, with hood like a cowl, peaked. The face is in shadow. She is small and her feet are small---with coarse square-toed shoes and gray woolen stockings.\\" After a long voyage the ship arrives at the jagged coast of America, where they could find no landing place for the ship. They launched several flat boats. According to Mrs. Curran, Patience was standing in the prow of her boat and became one of the first to reach the shore. Patience Worth was later to indicate that she was eventually killed by the Indians. In 1916, in a book with a foreword written by Casper Yost, editor of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Henry Holt and Company publicized Curran's claims that she had contacted the long dead Patience Worth. Curran claimed she began to anticipate what the Ouija board was going to spell and by 1919 the pointer would just move aimlessly about the board. Curran described pictorial visions which accompanied Patience's words. She said \\"I am like a child with a magic picture book. Once I look upon it, all I have to do is to watch its pages open before me, and revel in their beauty and variety and novelty....When the poems come, there also appear before my eyes images of each successive symbol, as the words are given me....When the stories come, the scenes become panoramic, with the characters moving and acting their parts, even speaking in converse. The picture is not confined to the point narrated, but takes in everything else within the circle of vision at the time....If the people talk a foreign language, as in The Sorry Tale, I hear the talk, but over and above is the voice of Patience, either interpreting or giving me the part she wishes to use as story.\\" Pearl Curran went on to describe her association with Patience Worth as \\"one of the most beautiful that can be the privilege of a human being to experience.\\" Pearl and Patience together wrote several novels including Telka, The Sorry Tale, Hope Trueblood, The Pot upon the Wheel, Samuel Wheaton, as well as several short stories and many poems.Lewis Spence. (2003). Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Kessinger Publishing. p. 695 The Patience Worth writings coincided with a revival of Spiritualism in the United States and Britain, possibly facilitating interest in the matter. Skeptics derided certain aspects of the supposed communication, noting particularly that Patience was able to write a novel about the Victorian age, an era some 200 years after the one in which she claimed to have lived. Still, the literature produced was considered to be of a high quality by some. For instance, the literary critic William Marion Reedy considered The Sorry Tale to be a new classic of world literature. Patience Worth was also listed as one of the outstanding authors of 1918 by The Joint Committee of Literary Arts of New York. She was also cited by William Stanley Braithwaite in the 1918 edition of the Anthology of Magazine Verse and Year Book of American Poetry by printing the complete text of five of her poems, along with other leading poets of the day including William Rose Benet, Amy Lowell, and Edgar Lee Masters. Braithwaite's index of magazine verse for 1918 listed the titles of eighty-eight poems by Patience Worth that appeared in magazines during the twelve-month period, only two of which were considered by Braithwaite to be lacking in any distinction. The same index listed ten poems by Amy Lowell and five by Edna St. Vincent Millay. After the death of her husband John Curran on June 1, 1922 who kept meticulous records of the Patience Worth sessions, the record of the Patience Worth sessions became episodic and fragmentary, with long gaps of time unaccounted for. Pearl was pregnant with her first child which was born six months after her husband's death. Pearl now had a family of four to support by herself and her financial situation so bleak that Herman Behr, a devoted friend, sent money to Mrs. Curran and announced that he would continue to do so as long as she needed it. Mr. Behr provided Mrs. Curran with an income of $400 a month for a number of years. Mrs Curran then entered the lecture circuit to make some money to support her family. A few months later, her mother Mrs. Mary Pollard died. The sessions with Patience Worth still continued regularly at Mrs. Curran's home. Mrs. Curran's financial situation continued to be bleak. She married two more times, but both marriages were short-lived. In the summer of 1930, Mrs. Curran left St. Louis for good and moved to California to live with an old friend Mrs. Alexander Bailey \\"Dotsie\\" Smith in the Los Angeles area. Patience was kept busy at the sessions, as always, by requests for her comments on major topics of the day and other issues. She continued to communicate through Pearl until November 25, 1937, when she gave her final communication. Pearl had apparently received a prior communication from Patience that she (Pearl) was going to die as Pearl told Dotsie Smith \\"Oh Dotsie, Patience has just shown me the end of the road and you will have to carry on as best you can.\\" Even though Pearl had not been in ill health, she developed pneumonia late in November and died on December 3, 1937.Lorin Cuoco, William H. Gass. (2000). Literary St. Louis: A Guide. Missouri History Museum Press. p. 137  Evaluation  = Paranormal belief = In 1916, Casper Yost published Patience Worth: A Psychic Mystery. In the book, he did not come to any definite conclusion but considered the case of Patience Worth to be inexplicable by any naturalistic theory. He was open to the spiritualist hypothesis.Casper Yost. (1916). Patience Worth: A Psychic Mystery. Henry Holt and Company. A thorough investigation of the case was conducted by the psychic researcher Walter Franklin Prince, who published in 1927 his book The Case of Patience Worth, which was a voluminous report of 509 pages covering the Patience Worth case from its inception in 1913 to about 1927, published by the Boston Society for Psychical Research. It provided a biographical sketch of Pearl Curran, eye-witness reports, opinions and reviews, poetry of Patience and Mrs. Curran, and much other information related to the case. Prince concluded his investigation by stating, \\"Either our concept of what we call the subconscious must be radically altered, so as to include potencies of which we hitherto have had no knowledge, or else some cause operating through but not originating in the subconsciousness of Mrs. Curran must be acknowledged.\\"Walter Franklin Prince. (1927). The Case of Patience Worth. Boston Society for Psychical Research. The parapsychologist Stephen E. Braude has examined the case of Patience Worth and concluded that Pearl Curran was probably a highly gifted child whose talent for writing was smothered by her mother, who wanted to force Pearl into a singing career. In the alter ego of Patience Worth, her subconscious could revive that talent.Stephen E. Braude. (2003). Immortal Remains: The Evidence for Life After Death. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. pp. 133-175. Braude has written \\"there is little reason to think that the evidence supports the hypothesis of survival. Although Patience offered various clues regarding her origin and identity, subsequent investigation revealed nothing to indicate that a Patience Worth ever existed.\\" Braude also considered the possibility of \\"super-psi\\": the view that Curran had subconsciously utilized a form of extrasensory perception to gather information.Emily Williams Cook. (1991). Research in Parapsychology. Scarecrow Press. p. 209 = Scientific skepticism = In 1914 Curran travelled to Boston to be tested by the psychologist Morton Prince. Curran used the Ouija board at his home on two occasions but refused to be put under hypnosis because she believed that it would destroy her contact with Patience Worth. Morton told reporters \\"nothing of scientific importance\\" occurred and \\"I consider the results inconsequential and of no scientific value\\".Alfred Douglas. (1982). Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research. Overlook Press. pp. 170-171 In 1919, Charles E. Cory Professor of Philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis published a paper titled Patience Worth in the Psychological Review which came to the conclusion Patience Worth was a subconscious personality of Curran.Charles Cory. (1919). Patience Worth. Psychological Review. pp. 397-407. In 1954, William Sentman Taylor a specialist in abnormal psychology also explained Curran's mediumship by psychological factors.William Sentman Taylor. (1954). Dynamic and Abnormal Psychology. American Book Company. pp. 308-326 The psychologists Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones in their book Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking (1989) have written: In 2011, the psychologist Richard Wiseman wrote: In 2012, the researcher Joe Nickell who published an article in the Skeptical Inquirer said he spent five hours studying Curran's writings at the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis. Nickell concluded: = Allegations of fraud = In 1916 the psychical researcher James Hyslop wrote that the whole case for Curran's mediumship was based on fraud. Hyslop in the Journal for the American Society for Psychical Research claimed Curran had known people from the Ozarks who spoke a dialect reminiscent of Patience Worth and Curran's husband had studied Chaucer and educated her on the subject. According to Hyslop the case of Patience Worth was \\"a fraud and delusion for any person who wishes to treat it seriously.\\" Hyslop also accused Casper Yost and the publisher of his book Henry Holt of knowing about the fraud but covering it up to increase sales of the book. In the Mirror articles appeared by Emily Hutchings and Yost defending Curran against allegations of fraud. In response, Hyslop wrote a letter to the Mirror which claimed he had been told of Curran's knowledge of Chaucer by a \\"scientific man\\" who had heard it from Mr Curran himself. In 1938 the ASPR journal published an anonymous article which refuted all of Hyslop's accusations. According to the article the Ozark dialect did not resemble the language of Patience Worth and knowledge of Chaucer would not have given Curran the vocabulary to compose the Patience Worth literature. Daniel Shea, a professor emeritus of English at Washington University, studied the case and wrote there might have been fraud involved by Curran's reading books and other material in the hours before the Patience Worth sessions. If true, Pearl may have felt guilt, which might have been expiated by her writing \\"Rosa Alvaro, Entrante.\\"Daniel Shea. (2012).

Merbromin is an organomercuric disodium salt compound and a fluorescein. Readily available in most countries, it is no longer sold in Switzerland, Brazil, France, Iran, Germany, and the United States due to its mercury content. Uses Merbromin's best-known use is as a topical antiseptic to treat minor wounds, burns, and scratches. It is also used in the antisepsis of the umbilical cord and the antisepsis of wounds with inhibited scar formation, such as neuropathic ulcers and diabetic foot sores. When applied on a wound, it stains the skin a distinctive carmine red, which can persist up to two weeks through repeated washings. It is useful on infections of the finger or toe nails because of its permanence and lethality to bacteria. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1998 classified merbromin as not generally recognized as safe due to a lack of recent studies and updated supporting information, not due to evidence of toxicity. In the United States, its use has been superseded by other agents (e.g., povidone iodine, benzalkonium chloride, chloroxylenol). Merbromin is also used as a biological dye to mark tissue margins and as a metal dye in industrial dye penetrant inspection to detect metal fractures. Synthesis Merbromin is synthesized by combining dibromofluorescein with mercuric acetate and sodium hydroxide or alternatively, through action of the mercuric acetate upon (or combining with) sodium dibromofluorescein. Because of its anionic character, it is chemically incompatible with acids (meaning that it can create dangerous exothermic or toxic gas reactions), the majority of alkaloid salts and most local anesthetics. Mercurochrome Merbromin is sold under the trade name Mercurochrome (where the suffix \\"-chrome\\" denotes \\"color\\"). The name is also commonly used for over-the-counter antiseptic solutions consisting of merbromin (typically at 2% concentration) dissolved in either ethyl alcohol (tincture) or water (aqueous). Its antiseptic qualities were discovered in 1918 by Hugh H. Young, a physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The chemical soon became popular among parents and physicians for everyday antiseptic uses, including minor schoolyard injuries. Some people referred to it as \\"monkey blood,\\" referring to its deep red color. On , citing potential for mercury poisoning, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reclassified merbromin from \\"generally recognized as safe\\" to \\"untested,\\" effectively halting its distribution within the United States. Sales were subsequently halted in Brazil (2001), Germany (2003),:de:Merbromin and France (2006).:fr:Merbromine It is readily available in most other countries. Within the United States, products such as Humco Mercuroclear (\\"Aqueous solution of benzalkonium chloride and lidocaine hydrochloride\\") play on the brand recognition history of Mercurochrome but substitute other ingredients with similar properties.

Belting is sometimes described as \\"high chest voice\\", although if this is done incorrectly can potentially be damaging for the voice. It is often described as a vocal register, although this is also technically incorrect; it is rather a descriptive term for the use of a register. Singers can use belting to convey heightened existential states. Singers such as Christina Aguilera are known for their signature styles of belting Twentieth-century culture has been distinctly affected by the exponent of belting. The Broadway theatre musical radically changed its course and style with this vocalization introduced by Ethel Merman's singing of \\"I Got Rhythm\\" in the Gershwins' Girl Crazy in 1930. The Evolution of the Female Broadway Singing Voice. Kevin Michael Jones. Nov, 2015 In 1964, the James Bond film Goldfinger had an opening credit sequence oversung with the belting of Shirley Bassey, a signature quality of singing to the James Bond films that continued through to the following century. Belting ‚Äì Shirley Bassey Nearly Passed Out Holding the Climactic Final Note of 'Goldfinger' Vs. mixing Belting is sometimes confused with mixing. Belting means to carry the chest voice above the break, while mixing means to mix chest voice with head voice. They are two different concepts but their subjects overlap. A belt voice can be mixed or not and a mix voice can be belted or not. One is able to belt purely and is able to belt with a head voice, which is also called mixing while one is able to mix their voices below their break and is able to mix above their break, which is also called belting. Technique \\"Chest register\\" is the lowest register of the singing voice, produced by dominant use of the thyroarytenoid muscle. The term \\"belt\\" is the use of a chest voice in the higher part of the voice. The chest voice is a general term for the sound and muscular functions of the speaking voice, singing in the lower range, and the voice used to shout. Each of those functions requires a thicker closure of the vocal folds and the support of the muscles surrounding them. The term \\"chest voice\\" is, therefore, a misunderstanding when it describes muscular work in the chest area of the body or a resonance therein. Proper production of the belt voice, according to some vocal methods, involves minimizing tension in the throat and a change of typical placement of the voice sound in the mouth, bringing it forward into the hard palate, although techniques vary by pedagogical style. It is possible to learn classical vocal methods like bel canto and also to be able to belt; in fact, many roles now require it. Vocalists trained in a wide berth of styles describe vastly varying experiences in the learning belt technique. Some claim that it comes naturally, while others struggle to access chest register other than while speaking. The style of music does not seem to be a related factor, other than in a singer's exposure to the material. Belt technique requires muscle coordination not readily used in classically trained singers as the thyroarytenoid muscle is dominant (as opposed to head register singing where the cricothyroid muscle is dominant), which may be why some opera singers find learning to belt challenging. Physiology There are many explanations as to how the belting voice quality is produced. Under a scope, the vocal folds visibly shorten and thicken, and they undulate along with more of their vertical surface area than in head register when a smaller segment of their edge must undulate to produce sound. One researcher, Jo Estill, has conducted research on the belting voice,Estill J (1988). Belting and Classic Voice Quality: Some Physiological Differences. Medical Problems of Performing Artists, 3:37‚Äì43.Yanagisawa E and Estill J (1989). The Contribution of Aryepiglottic Constriction to \\"Ringing\\" Voice Quality. Journal of Voice, 3:342‚Äì350 and describes the belting voice as an extremely muscular and physical way of singing. When observing the vocal tract and torso of singers, while belting, Estill observed: *Minimal airflow (longer closed phase (70% or greater) than in any other type of phonation) *Maximum muscular engagement of the torso (in Estill Voice Training terminology this is known as Torso Control or Anchoring) *Engagement of muscles in the head and neck in order to stabilize the larynx) (in Estill Voice Training terminology this is known as Head and Neck Control or Anchoring) *A downward tilt of the cricoid cartilage (an alternative option would be the thyroid tilting backward. Observations show a larger CT space) *High positioning of the larynx *Maximum muscular effort of the extrinsic laryngeal muscles, minimum effort at the level of the true vocal folds. *Narrowing of the aryepiglottic sphincter (the \\"twanger\\") Possible dangers Belting without proper coordination can lead to constriction of the muscles surrounding the vocal mechanism. Constriction can consequently lead to vocal deterioration.The Oxford Dictionary of Opera by John Warrack and Ewan West (1992), Correct use of the technique and, most importantly, retraction of the ventricular folds while singing is vital to safe belting, as it is, in essence a form of \\"yell\\" and thus involves a tremendous (roughly +70%) increase in the force exerted on the soft structures of the pharynx vs. more common modes of singing. Attempting to belt too loudly, in too high a register and without properly supporting the ventricular folds are (in combination) the \\"Three Devils\\" of the belter; an untrained belter may well consider the short term irritations (hoarseness, throat pain) caused by bad form to be just a \\"part of the job\\", when in reality it indicates a flaw in their belting skill that will cause long term serious damage (vocal cord nodules, irreversible loss of former range and timbre) if not changed. While acknowledging the extra risks inherent to belting, many proponents take pains to point out that it is an advanced skill which (so long as it is a \\"soft yell\\", and produced properly without straining and pain) is no more damaging to the voice than any other type of singing. Indeed, some genres of singing (such as blues rock) rely on belting to allow the vocalist to \\"cut through\\" the electric guitar while playing live. Many in the musical theater industry like to quip, \\"belting is not bad; bad belting is bad.\\"Justin Stoney, \\"\\", Voice Council, 2016. As for the physiological and acoustical features of the metallic voice, a master's thesisEliana Midori Hanayama, \\"Voz met√°lica: estudo das caracter√≠sticas fisiol√≥gicas e ac√∫sticas\\", S√£o Paulo: Faculdade de Medicina, USP, 2003. has drawn the following conclusions: *No significant changes in frequency and amplitude of F1 were observed *Significant increases in amplitudes of F2, F3 and F4 were found *In frequencies for F2, metallic voice perceived as louder was correlated to increase in amplitude of F3 and F4 *Vocal tract adjustments like velar lowering, pharyngeal wall narrowing, laryngeal raising, aryepiglottic and lateral laryngeal constriction were frequently found.

Instead, one competitor will take the lead in raising or lowering prices. The others will then follow suit, raising or lowering their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result. This practice can be harmful to consumers who, if the market power of the firm is used, can be forced to pay monopoly prices for goods that should be selling for only a little more than the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prosecute because it may occur without any collusion between the competitors.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1946 to 1949 as an independent representative, and in the House of Commons of Canada from 1951 to 1968 as a Progressive Conservative. He was a federal cabinet minister in the government of John Diefenbaker.  Early life  The son of J. W. Churchill and Mary Shier, Churchill was educated in Port Arthur, Ontario, at United College in Winnipeg and at the University of Manitoba, receiving a Master of Arts degree and a law degree. He worked as a teacher and school principal, and served as president of the Manitoba Teachers' Society. He also was a member of the law firm of Haig and Haig in Winnipeg, dominated by the family of Conservative politician John Thomas Haig. In 1922, he married Mona Mary McLachlin.  Military Service  Churchill saw action in both World Wars. He served overseas in World War I from 1916 to 1919 as a Vickers Machine Gunner. During World War II, he served from 1939 to 1945 with the Fort Garry Horse and Commanding Officer (Lieutenant Colonel) 1st Canadian Carrier Regiment in Northwestern Europe. In 1945, he became Dean of Faculty at Khaki University in England.  Political career  Churchill's political career began in January 1946, when he was elected to the Manitoba legislature in a special by-election for Manitobans in the Canadian Army, who had not been able to cast ballots in the 1945 provincial election. Despite his ties to the Progressive Conservative Party, he served in the legislature as an independent member for the next four years. He resigned from the Manitoba legislature in 1949 to run for the Canadian House of Commons. Running in Winnipeg South Centre, he finished a distant second against Liberal candidate Ralph Maybank. Maybank resigned two years later, and Churchill was narrowly elected over Liberal Norman Wright to replace him. He was returned by a greater margin in the 1953 federal election, and by a significant majority in the 1957 election. Churchill was a key adviser to Progressive Conservative Party leader John Diefenbaker during this period, and was widely credited with developing the strategy that propelled Diefenbaker to victory in 1957. The Liberal Party of Louis St. Laurent had been in power since 1935, and appeared to have strong popular support. Prior to the 1957 election, Churchill wrote a confidential paper arguing that the Progressive Conservative Party could form government by targeting seats in the English-speaking provinces, and did not need to invest resources in Quebec. Diefenbaker followed this strategy, and won a minority government in 1957. Queen Elizabeth and members of the federal government of Canada in Ottawa 1957-10-14 Churchill was appointed to Diefenbaker's cabinet on June 21, 1957 as Minister of Trade and Commerce. Later in the year, he led a 57-member trade delegation to the United Kingdom, touring firms throughout the country. The Progressive Conservatives were re- elected with a landslide majority in the 1958 federal election, and Churchill defeated his nearest opponent in Winnipeg South Centre by a margin of almost 20,000 votes. Churchill gave approval in 1959 for Canada's first commercial power nuclear reactor, a CANDU design, to be built at Douglas Point, Ontario. In addition to holding the Trade and Commerce portfolio, he served as acting Leader of the Government in the House of Commons from January 14 to September 10, 1960. On October 17, 1960, he was confirmed to this position on a full- time basis. After a cabinet shuffle on October 11, 1960, he was named Minister of Veterans Affairs. The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected in the 1962 federal election, but were again reduced to a minority government. Churchill's majority against Liberal Ed Russenholt fell to only 2,000 votes. After another cabinet shuffle on February 12, 1963, he was promoted to Minister of National Defence. He had not served two months in this position when the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1963 federal election. Churchill defeated Liberal clergyman Fred Douglas in a further reduced majority, and served as opposition House Leader in the parliament which followed. Churchill again defeated Douglas by about 2,000 votes in the 1965 federal election, which the Progressive Conservatives also lost. During the flag debates of the 1960s, Churchill referred to the Pearson pennant:File:Canada Pearson Pennant 1964.svg as a \\"piece of bunting\\". The Ottawa Citizen quoted him describing Prime Minister Lester Pearson as \\"a sawdust Caesar, reminding me of Mussolini, trying to force the country to accept his personal choice for a flag.\\" Churchill remained loyal to John Diefenbaker during the Progressive Conservative Party's internal quarrels of the 1960s, and continued to work for Diefenbaker at the party's 1967 leadership convention. When Diefenbaker left the race, he sent Churchill as an emissary to Dufferin Roblin's camp to accept a Roblin badge. In February 1968, Churchill attacked new Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield for not forcing an election when the Liberal government of Lester Pearson was unexpectedly defeated in the house.  Retirement and Death  He left the Progressive Conservative caucus on February 27, 1968 to sit as an Independent Progressive Conservative, and did not run for re-election in the 1968 campaign. He died in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 86.  Archives  There is a Gordon Churchill fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

It is a subsidiary of Carter's. OshKosh B'Gosh was originally founded in 1895 as Grove Manufacturing Company, a small-town manufacturer of adult work clothing. The most notable product was the \\"hickory striped\\" overalls for railroad workers and agriculture workers. The name was used for the products after general manager William Pollack heard the \\"Oshkosh B'Gosh\\" tagline in a vaudeville routine in New York; the company adopted the name in 1937. it has become best known for its children's clothing, especially bibbed overalls. The original children's overalls, dating from the early 20th century, were intended to let parents dress their children like their fathers. According to the company, sales of the product increased after Miles Kimball, an Oshkosh-based mail order catalog, featured a pair of the overalls in its national catalog in 1960. As a result, OshKosh began to sell their products through department stores and expanded their children's line. Children's clothing made up 15 percent of the company's sales in 1979; by 1993 that number was 95 percent. An example of Oshkosh shortalls in the train engineer's style In 1997, after 102 years in the hometown, the Wisconsin plant was closed. Oshkosh B'Gosh clothes are no longer made in Oshkosh. Downsizing of domestic operations and massive outsourcing and manufacturing at Mexican and Honduran subsidiaries saw the domestic manufacturing share drop below 10% by the year 2000. The company was sold to Carter's, another clothing manufacturer, in 2005 for $312 million, though it still operates under the original name. Today the company sells accessories, jeans, pants, shirts, sweaters, t-shirts, tank tops, and its trademark overalls. The company produces clothing for babies, infants, toddlers, kids (4-7), and youth (5-14); however, it no longer manufactures clothing in adult sizes due to poor sales. The company also has over 300 stores in the United States of America.

K. Narayan, is the biography of a fictional character named Sri K. V. Jagan who is a sweet vendor of (a fictional Indian town) Malgudi. His conflict with his estranged son and how he finally leaves for renunciation, overwhelmed by the sheer pressure and monotony of his life is beautifully reflected in the story. The novel was produced into Mithaivalla, part of the Hindi TV series, Malgudi Days, and was subsequently dubbed into English. The vendor of sweets tells about the relationship between a father and a son after the death of the mother.  Plot  Jagan is a 55-year-old sweetmeat vendor, a successful businessman, a vehement follower of Mahatma Gandhi and an honest, hardworking and humble resident of the fictional suburb, Malgudi, India. In his youth, he was influenced deeply by Mahatma Gandhi and left his studies and his peaceful life to become an active member in India's struggle for freedom from the British Empire. The Bhagavad Gita forms the staple of his life; he tries to act on the principles described in the great epic. Naturopathy forms the pivotal of his life and he even desires to publish his natural way of living in the form of a book, but it becomes obvious that it is a futile dream as the draft has been gathering dust in the office of the local printer, Nataraj, for the last five years. Jagan wears hand spun cloth that signifies purity to him, and he has been commended for it by Gandhi himself. In his early days Jagan's wife, Ambika, dies from a brain tumor and leaves him to care for his only son, Mali. Mali is gradually spoilt by Jagan and his almost 'maternal' obsession towards his son's life. Later, in his college days, Mali displays his deep dislike for education and says that he would like to be a 'writer', which Jagan at first interprets as a clerical occupation. Afterwards, Mali decides to leave to America to study Creative Writing. He gets his passport and tickets ready without even informing Jagan about his plans. In fact, Jagan used to conceal some part of his earnings to avoid the taxes. Mali takes the money from his father's hidden treasure to fulfill his expenditures. Eventually it becomes known to Jagan. But, he accepts this diversion with good heart and treasures every letter received from Mali and proudly exhibits it to anyone whom he met in his daily activities. A few years later, Mali returns to Malgudi very Westernized and brings along a half-American, half-Korean girl, Grace, whom Mali claims is his 'wife'. Jagan assumes that they are married according to the social norms and standards, but also realizes that Mali's relationship with him has further eroded. However, Jagan develops an affection for Grace and feels that Mali is not giving her the attention she deserves. Soon Mali expresses his grandiose scheme of starting a machine factory with the association of some anonymous business partners from America. He asks his father to invest in this factory, but Jagan is unwilling to provide the financial infrastructure of this venture, which causes more friction between Jagan and Mali. Troubled by this turmoil, Jagan decides to retire from active working. Through an unexpected meeting with the top businessmen of the region, Jagan comes across the 'bearded man', a rather eccentric hairdryer whose eloquence makes Jagan contemplate on his dull and monotonous life. He starts to develop a desire to have renunciation from his life, and suddenly falls into a recollection of his happy past with his family and his wife, which further strengthens his need for reconciliation. As this happens, Mali is caught by the police for driving under the influence of alcohol and deserts his wife. Jagan then asks his cousin to make sure that Mali stays in prison for some time, so that he can learn his mistakes. Jagan also writes a cheque to the cousin so that he can buy a plane ticket for Grace so she can go back to her motherland. Main characters * Jagan: The protagonist. A follower of Gandhi in his youth, he is now a sweetmeat vendor by profession. The novel portrays him as a typical Homo Narayans; Jagan is a timid man, not notably wealthy or poverty-stricken, and yearns to spend life with the least troubles. He appears to be an extremely orthodox and peaceful man. His only son is the pearl of his eye. Occasionally, Jagan exploits religion and his Gandhian principles to save himself from his mental agitations and Mali's various attempts at bulldozing his peace and hates European culture * Mali: Jagan's son. An ambitious young man, spoilt by Jagan, he has a strong repugnance towards the educational system of India, and desires for more modern prospects of business. Blames his father for his mother's death. After studying Creative Writing in America, he comes back to his hometown and tries to \\"modernize\\" it. * The cousin: The 'man-about-town', he claims his cousinhood with everyone in Malgudi. He proves to be helpful in creating a communicative bridge between Jagan and Mali. He is quite an affable character who displays appreciation of Jagan's simple Gandhian lifestyle and simultaneously gets on well with Mali and his various modern notions. Close criticism may prove him to be a ambitious, calculating man with the intention of gaining the control of Jagan's business, which he does at the end of the story. Creates humor, hypocrisy in the story. * Grace: A half-American, half-Korean girl whom Mali brings home, claiming that she is Mali's wife. She works like a catalyst between the two conflicting cultures, and tries to integrate into the Indian culture that she has entered into, but results only in strengthening the cultural difference.  Analysis  The novel is predominantly about the relationship between father and son. Jagan - whose wife died when their son was a young boy - constantly tries to bond with his son, but fails badly due to his own backwardness in communication. Another major theme expressed in this book is the clash of the Indian and western cultures. Jagan's lives in Malgudi and follows the Indian culture and traditions. On the other hand, Mali comes to India completely influenced by the western culture.  Summary  'Chapter-1 At the beginning of the chapter one, we learn that Jagan is a very religious person who offers prayers to Lakshmi every morning. He lives by the adage 'Conquer taste, and you will have conquered the self.' When Jagan's cousin questions his faith in the maxim, Jagan merely states that he is only following the advice of sages. Jagan is the vendor of sweets. He owns a sweet mart where sweetmeats are prepared and sold to the customers. The writer employs both visual and olfactory imagery to depict the scene of Jagan's religious activities performed in the morning with the scent of jasmine flowers and the incense sticks. Even the scent of the sweetmeats frying in ghee spreads all around.  Criticism  The novel is composed in simple, lucid English that can be read and understood without turning over the pages after a single read. The compositional language is no doubt, plain‚Äì to such an extent that even a young school child's vocabulary will be able to comprehend the sense of the tale. Narayan's skill of writing that allows him to use English to breathe life into his stories with ease can be easily found in this novel. Although Narayan's native language was Tamil ( a language from the state of Tamil Nadu in South India), he utilized English in such a way that allowed his readers to step into the streets of Malgudi, and allowed them to feel the same aromas, the same, bright Indian sunlight and the same feelings of his characters. > \\"Reading Narayan, you soon see, is a little like sitting on a rocking chair > in a steadily churning train; the story is always pushing forward, with not > a wasted sentence or detail, and yet its theme and often its characters are > all about going nowhere and getting somewhere References Category:1967 > novels Category:Novels by R.

He was speaker of the Riigivolikogu (lower chamber) from 4 April 1938 to 12 October 1939. Uluots then served as prime minister from 1939 until June 1940 when Soviet troops entered Estonia and installed a new Soviet puppet government led by Johannes Vares, whereas Uluots' constitutional government went underground (and later, in exile). The communist puppet government was never recognized by the United States, United Kingdom and other western powers who considered it and the August 1940 annexation of Estonia into the USSR illegal. \\"whereas the Soviet annexias of the three Baltic States still has not been formally recognized by most European States and the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the Vatican still adhere to the concept of the Baltic States\\". After the Estonian President Konstantin P√§ts was arrested by Soviet occupation forces and deported to Russia in July 1940, Professor Uluots became prime minister in the duties of the president as dictated by the Estonian constitution. When the Nazis invaded Soviet-occupied Estonia in 1941 the communist government was overthrown. Ulouts refused German offers to head the Estonian Self- Administration in 1941 and instead formed part of the underground Estonian resistance to the Nazi occupation regime. In January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. Narva was evacuated. J√ºri Uluots delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for German military service (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38.000 draftees appeared at German registration centers.Resistance!

On 20 April 1944, the National Committee selected the Electoral Committee of the Republic of Estonia.

Clark was an unarmed getaway driver in the Brink's robbery of 1981 in Nanuet, New York. The robbers murdered a security guard and two Nyack, New York police officers. Clark was arrested in October 1981 and convicted of felony murder for her role in the crime. She was sentenced to the maximum penalty allowed by law: Imprisonment for a term of 75 years to life at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York. In December 2016, after extensive public and legal support, Governor Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence to 35 years to life, making her eligible for parole. She was denied parole in April 2017, but granted parole on April 17, 2019 after 37 years in prison. Clark was released on May 10, 2019. Early life, family, education, and early activism Clark grew up in a Jewish family with her older brother and parents, Joe Clark and his wife Ruth. Her parents were members of the American Communist Party for many years. As an infant, Clark lived in the Soviet Union from 1950 to 1953. After the family returned home to the U.S., her parents withdrew from the Communist Party, disillusioned with the Soviet Union. Clark attended the University of Chicago, where she joined Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and helped to found the Women's Radical Action Project, one of the first organizations of the early women's liberation movement.Kirkpatrick Sales, SDS: The rise and development of the Students for a Democratic Society, Vintage (1973) Weather Underground involvement In 1969, Clark participated in the Days of Rage in Chicago, and she was arrested, along with several hundreds of others, for \\"mob action\\".Harold Jacobs, ed., Weatherman, Ramparts (1970); Jeremy Varon, Bringing the War Home, University of California (2004) Clark jumped bail and was considered a \\"fugitive from justice\\". When she was caught, she pleaded guilty and served nine months in Cook County Jail in Chicago. Two months after her release, there was a prison uprising at Attica. In its wake, Clark was one of the founders of The Midnight Special, a newspaper affiliated with the National Lawyers Guild. Clark was also a member of the Women's Bail Fund and worked in support of political prisoners.Max Elbaum, Revolution in the Air, Verso (2002) When the May 19th Communist Organization was founded in 1976, Clark became a member, continuing her work as someone who visited political prisoners.Dan Berger, The Hidden 1970s, Rutgers University Press (2010) She was a named petitioner in the lawsuit Clark v. U.S.A., which challenged the FBI's Cointelpro Program. That suit was eventually settled in the plaintiffs' favor. Ultimately, May 19 became an isolated remnant of the dwindling \\"anti- imperialist\\" movement, and Clark became isolated from society at large.G. Zwerman and P.

Brown, 525 N.Y.S.2d 618, 620 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep't 1988) (saying the shooters were \\"as many as six armed men\\") During the robbery, Peter Paige, a Brink's guard, was killed and guard Joseph Trombino was seriously injured. As the men escaped from the robbery, the van into which they had switched was stopped by a police barricade, and two Nyack police officers, Waverly Brown and Edward O'Grady, were killed during the gun battle that ensued. Clark was the driver of a nearby getaway car into which one of the robbers and David Gilbert jumped after the gun battle. After a car chase, Clark was arrested as she reached for a loaded weapon. Also arrested at the scene was Kathy Boudin, who served 22 years in prison and has been released on parole. =Prosecution and conviction= Clark was charged with three counts of felony murder and was tried together with David Gilbert and Kuwesi Balagoon. They refused to be represented by counsel; instead, they decided to represent themselves. When the three defendants refused to behave in accordance with courtroom decorum, they were banned from the courtroom and placed in cells in the basement; the trial was piped in over a speaker system. No standby counsel was appointed to represent the defendants. All three were convicted of all charges, and each was sentenced to three consecutive 25-year-to-life sentences. Boudin, who was represented by counsel, entered a plea of guilty to a single count of felony murder and received a sentence of 20 years to life. =Incarceration= Clark was incarcerated at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York. In September 1985, letters implicating Clark in a possible escape plan were found. She was charged with conspiracy to escape and sentenced to two years in solitary confinement in the Special Housing Unit (SHU). In SHU, Clark began a process of self-reflection, which ultimately led to her renouncing her status as a \\"political prisoner\\".Fortune News; Rockland Journal; accessed September 10, 2017. Clark publicly apologized for her role in the Brink's robbery in March 2002. Clark participated in a number of writing groups, including one led for twelve years by poet Hettie Jones. Clark was among the inmates at Bedford Hills featured in the 2003 documentary What I Want My Words to Do to You.What I Want My Words To Do To You, POV, PBS, premiered December 16, 2003 While in prison, Clark also obtained a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, developed an AIDS education program, trained service dogs, and counseled incarcerated mothers. Habeas corpus petition In 2006, a United States District Court granted Clark a writ of habeas corpus, reversing her conviction on the grounds that she was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The court ruled: \\"During the prosecutor's opening statement and during the government's entire direct case against defendants, which spanned at least seven trial days, no one was present in the courtroom to represent Clark's interests. Clark was without assistance of counsel for her defense, in clear abrogation of her Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\\" However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court's decision on the grounds that Clark had procedurally defaulted on her claim by not raising it on direct appeal before the state court, and had knowingly and intelligently waived her Sixth Amendment rights by choosing to represent herself. Clemency Represented by attorney Sara Bennett, Clark petitioned Governor Paterson for clemency in 2010. More than 900 people wrote letters in support of her petition, including: Robert Dennison, the former chairperson of parole under Governor Pataki; Elaine Lord, the superintendent of Bedford Hills for the first 22 years of Clark's incarceration; and Frank Olivier, a corrections officer of 23 years who grew up with one of the deceased as a role model.\\"Judith Clark's Radical Transformation\\", New York Times Magazine, January 15, 2012. Lord wrote to the governor, \\"I watched her change into one of the most perceptive, thoughtful, helpful and profound human beings that I have ever known, either inside or outside of a prison.\\" Dennison wrote that she was \\"the most worthy candidate for clemency that I‚Äôve ever seen.\\"Letters of Support , Judithclark.org; accessed September 10, 2017. Clark, represented by Michael Cardozo, again applied for clemency, and in December 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence to 35 years to life. When granting clemency, the governor said Clark had made \\"exceptional strides in self-development\\". Parole After Governor Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence to 35 years to life in December 2016, Clark became eligible for parole. She was denied parole in April 2017. According to the Parole Board, Clark was \\"still a symbol of violent and terroristic crime\\". More than 10,000 New Yorkers submitted their signatures in opposition to parole for Clark. Despite opposition from conservative lawmakers, law enforcement groups, and prosecutors Clark was granted parole in a split decision on April 17, 2019 and was released from prison on May 10, 2019. Clark's supporters had \\"bombarded the State Parole Board with pleas for her release\\". In popular culture Clark was a model for a character in David Mamet's play The Anarchist. Additionally, she was the inspiration for the role of Hannah, performed by Dame Harriet Walter in the 2016 Donmar Warehouse production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.

It is cognate to the Chinese family names Shƒìn (Áî≥) and Xin (Ëæõ). According to the 2000 census in South Korea, there were 911,556 people carrying the Shin surname. Clans There are three Chinese characters for the Shin surname. Between these three characters, there are six different clans. Each Shin clan descends from a different founding ancestor. One of the Shin clans, the Yeongsan Shin clan traces its origins to China. Members of the various Shin clans can be found throughout the Korean peninsula. As with other Korean family names, the holders of the \\"Shin\\" family name are divided into various clans, each known by the name of a town or city, called bon-gwan in Korean. Usually that town or city is the one where the clan's founder lived. There are six lines of Shin: (1) Pyeongsan Shin (Âπ≥Â±± Áî≥), (2) Goryeong Shin (È´òÈùà Áî≥), (3) Aju Shin (ÈµùÊ¥≤ Áî≥) (4) Saknyeong Shin (ÊúîÂØß Áî≥) (5) Yeongsan Shin (ÈùàÂ±± Ëæõ), and (6) Samgal Shin (ÏÇºÍ∞à ÊÑº). Although the first four clans ‚Äî Pyeongsan Shin, Goryeong Shin, Aju Shin, and Saknyeong Shin ‚Äî share the same Chinese character Áî≥, they are unrelated in heritage. The fifth lineage uses the Chinese character Ëæõ, and the sixth lineage uses the Chinese character ÊÑº.Shrine of Shin Sung-gyeom in northern Daegu. The Pyeongsan Shin lineage makes up about 70% of all those with the name Shin using the Chinese character Áî≥. The clan's founder was General Shin Sung-gyeom. This clan associated with a mountain in North Korea called \\"Pyeongsan\\" (Âπ≥Â±±, literally \\"mountain of peace\\"). The mountain was originally named Samneungsan (‰∏âËÉΩÂ±±, literally \\"mountain of three talents\\"), without a family name, before being linked to the Shin surname by King Taejo of Goryeo. According to the Pyeongsan Shin family legend, one day when King Taejo and his generals went out hunting near Pyeongsan, Taejo saw three geese flying above them, and asked his generals whether any of them could shoot the geese down. Shin Sung-gyeom volunteered and asked Taejo which one he should shoot. Taejo asked Shin to shoot the third goose in its left wing, and to Taejo's surprise, Shin completed the task. Taejo was highly impressed and gave Shin 300 gyeol (Í≤∞ or Áµê, an ancient measurement of area) of local land, which became Shin Sung- gyeom's hometown. Shin Sung-gyeom also saved the life of King Taejo of Goryeo during a disastrous battle with Hubaekje near present-day Daegu in the early 10th century. Taejo awarded General Shin the clan name Pyeongsan Sin, after his hometown, for his loyalty and bravery he showed in the battle. Other prominent members of this clan include the 16th-century artist, writer, and poet Shin Saimdang and the 19th-century pansori writer Shin Jae-hyo. Every year, a number of people who claim to belong to the Pyeongsan Shin clan gather at the memorial shrine of Shin Sung-gyeom in the South Korean province of Gangwon Province. Prior to the Korean war, the original shrine was situated in the now North-Korean province of Hwanghae Province, to which the clan land of Pyeongsan traces its roots. Another well-known line that also uses the Chinese character Áî≥ is the Goryeong Shin, descended from Shin Suk-ju, who was the lead scholar to work with King Sejong the Great in the development of Hangul, the Korean written language. Shin Suk-ju was also a high ranking government minister and belonged to the Hall of Worthies. The Goryeong Shin lineage makes up about 17% of all those who carry the Shin name using the Chinese character Áî≥. Three of five members of Shin Suk-ju's 16th generation are known to have immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. One descendant of the Shins to travel to the US is a famous and scholarly physician named David Sheen. Another prominent member of the clan is Danjae Shin Chaeho, a 19th-century nationalist historian.

Administered by the Tribunals Service, it was superseded in 2005 by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, which itself was superseded in 2010 by the Asylum and Immigration Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal created by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Description The system of appeals to adjudicators appointed by the Home Secretary, with the right of appeal to a body then called the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, with members appointed by the Lord Chancellor, was created by the Immigration Appeals Act 1969. As a result of the Immigration Act 1971, the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) became an independent judicial body consisting of two tiers: Immigration Adjudicators and an Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT). The Adjudicators initially considered appeals against decisions made by Immigration Officers, entry clearance officers and the Home Secretary, based in permanent centres in Islington, London, Hatton Cross, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow. The Tribunal dealt with applications for leave to appeal and appeals against decisions made by the Immigration Adjudicators, with its main hearing centre in Bream's Buildings, off Chancery Lane in Central London. The Tribunal was headed by a President, who was required to be a barrister or a solicitor of at least seven years' standing.Richard Meredith Jackson, J. R.

Built in 1988 in Lahaina on the island of Maui, the Hawaiian Chieftain is a contemporary interpretation of a traditional design. She is unique with the rig of a 19th-century trading vessel and a modern triple keel, shallow draft hull. Drawing only , she is highly maneuverable in shallow waters. The Hawaiian Chieftain was commissioned by Laurence H. Dorcy, Jr., designed by nautical architect Ray Richards, and built by Lahaina Welding Co. Ltd. on the island of Maui; Drake Thomas was the ship's builder. Lofting, initial hull framing and partial hull plating was performed by Morgan Davies (until his departure from the project in December 1986).Completion of hull welding (including bow and topside plating) was performed by ship welders Ken Bear, Bill Purvis, Lionel Clemons and Oliver Pagttie. Additional expert tradesmen were hired for the rigging (George Herbert/Ivan Hope), ship's carpentry, machinery (Alan Fleming, Carl Geringer) and electrical installation. Master Mariner Des Kearns played a key role as a Project Director from early 1987 until launch in June 1988. Under its paint, her bowsprit bears the inscription \\"Lahaina Welding Co.\\" Her maiden voyage was to French Polynesia on April 1, 1990 and arriving in Papeete on April 20, 1990. She was based in Sausalito, CA for many years, sailing up and down the coast with the Lady Washington on Voyages of ReDiscovery, providing hands-on history programs teaching 4th and 5th graders about the exploration and trade along the West Coast in the 1790s. Hawaiian Chieftain in her current colors In the winter of 2004, she was sold to a Cape Cod sailing program and renamed the Spirit of Larinda; however, due to the unexpected death of her owner, she remained inactive. In October 2005, the Grays Harbor Historical Seaport Authority, owner of Lady Washington, purchased her to add to its fleet. Returning to her original identity as the Hawaiian Chieftain, she joined up with the Lady Washington on February 25, 2006 to provide joint education and sail training up and down the west coast of the United States. In February, 2020, GHHSA announced they would be retiring Hawaiian Chieftain to focus on operation of Lady Washington.

In modern times, the effect was observed by Karl Wilhelm von N√§geli, although he did not identify the cause. Scholarly texts from ancient India promoted the use of brass and silver in ritual cleansing practice as well as in consumption of food and drink. The ancient Indian medical text Sushruta Samhita promoted the use of specific metals in surgical procedures as a measure to prevent infection. Brass doorknobs and silverware both exhibit this effect to an extent.  Mechanism  The metals react with thiol (-SH) or amine (-NH(1,2,3)) groups of proteins, a mode of action to which microorganisms may develop resistance. Such resistance may be transmitted by plasmids.  Use  = Aluminium = Aluminium acetate (Burow's solution) is used as an astringent mild antiseptic. = Antimony = Orthoesters of diarylstibinic acids are fungicides and bactericides, used in paints, plastics, and fibers. Trivalent organic antimony was used in therapy for schistosomiasis. = Arsenic = For many decades, arsenic was used medicinally to treat syphilis. It is still used in sheep dips, rat poisons, wood preservatives, weed killers, and other pesticides. Arsenic is also still used for murder by poisoning, for which use it has a long and continuing history in both literature and fact. = Barium = Barium polysulfide is a fungicide and acaricide used in fruit and grape growing. = Bismuth = Bismuth compounds have been used because of their astringent, antiphlogistic, bacteriostatic, and disinfecting actions. In dermatology bismuth subgallate is still used in vulnerary salves and powders as well as in antimycotics. In the past, bismuth has also been used to treat syphilis and malaria. = Boron = Boric acid esters derived from glycols (example, organo-borate formulation, Biobor JF) are being used for the control of microorganisms in fuel systems containing water. = Copper = Brass vessels release a small amount of copper ions into stored water, thus killing fecal bacterial counts as high as 1 million bacteria per milliliter. Copper sulfate mixed with lime (Bordeaux mixture) is used as a fungicide and antihelminthic. Copper sulfate is used chiefly to destroy green algae (algicide) that grow in reservoirs, stock ponds, swimming pools, and fish tanks. Copper 8-hydroxyquinoline is sometimes included in paint to prevent mildew. Paint containing copper is used on boat bottoms to prevent barnacle growth. = Gold = Gold is used in dental inlays and inhibits the growth of bacteria. = Lead = Physicians prescribed various forms of lead to heal ailments ranging from constipation to infectious diseases such as the plague. Lead was also used to preserve or sweeten wine. Lead arsenate is used in insecticides and herbicides. Some organic lead compounds are used as industrial biocides: thiomethyl triphenyllead is used as an antifungal agent, cotton preservative, and lubricant additive; thiopropyl triphenyllead as a rodent repellant; tributyllead acetate as a wood and cotton preservative; tributyllead imidazole as a lubricant additive and cotton preservative. = Mercury = Phenylmercuric borate and acetate were used for disinfecting mucous membranes at an effective concentration of 0.07% in aqueous solutions. Due to toxicological and ecotoxicological reasons phenylmercury salts are no longer in use. However, some surgeons use mercurochrome despite toxicological objections. Dental amalgam used in fillings inhibits bacterial reproduction. Organic mercury compounds have been used as topical disinfectants (thimerosal, nitromersol, and merbromin) and preservatives in medical preparations (thimerosal) and grain products (both methyl and ethyl mercurials). Mercury was used in the treatment of syphilis. Calomel was commonly used in infant teething powders in the 1930s and 1940s. Mercurials are also used agriculturally as insecticides and fungicides. = Nickel = The toxicity of nickel to bacteria, yeasts, and fungi differs considerably. = Silver = The metabolism of bacteria is adversely affected by silver ions at concentrations of 0.01‚Äì0.1 mg/L. Therefore, even less soluble silver compounds, such as silver chloride, also act as bactericides or germicides, but not the much less soluble silver sulfide. In the presence of atmospheric oxygen, metallic silver also has a bactericidal effect due to the formation of silver oxide, which is soluble enough to cause it. Even objects with a solid silver surface (e.g., table silver, silver coins, or silver foil) have a bactericidal effect. Silver drinking vessels were carried by military commanders on expeditions for protection against disease. It was once common to place silver foil or even silver coins on wounds for the same reason. Silver sulfadiazine is used as an antiseptic ointment for extensive burns. An equilibrium dispersion of colloidal silver with dissolved silver ions can be used to purify drinking water at sea. Silver is incorporated into medical implants and devices such as catheters. Surfacine (silver iodide) is a relatively new antimicrobial for application to surfaces. Silver-impregnated wound dressings have proven especially useful against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Silver nitrate is used as a hemostatic, antiseptic and astringent. At one time, many states required that the eyes of newborns be treated with a few drops of silver nitrate to guard against an infection of the eyes called gonorrheal neonatal ophthalmia, which the infants might have contracted as they passed through the birth canal. Silver ions are increasingly incorporated into many hard surfaces, such as plastics and steel, as a way to control microbial growth on items such as toilet seats, stethoscopes, and even refrigerator doors. Among the newer products being sold are plastic food containers infused with silver nanoparticles, which are intended to keep food fresher, and silver-infused athletic shirts and socks, which claim to minimize odors. = Thallium = Thallium compounds such as thallium sulfate have been used for impregnating wood and leather to kill fungal spores and bacteria, and for the protection of textiles from attack by moths. Thallium sulfate has been used as a depilatory and in the treatment of venereal disease, skin fungal infections, and tuberculosis. = Tin = Tetrabutyltin is used as an antifouling paint for ships, for the prevention of slimes in industrial recirculating water systems, for combating freshwater snails that cause bilharzia, as a wood and textile preservative, and as a disinfectant. Tricyclohexyltin hydroxide is used as an acaricide. Triphenyltin hydroxide and triphenyltin acetate are used as fungicides. = Zinc = Zinc oxide is used as a weak antiseptic (and sunscreen), and in paints as a white pigment and mold-growth inhibitor. Zinc chloride is a common ingredient in mouthwashes and deodorants, and zinc pyrithione is an ingredient in antidandruff shampoos. Galvanized (zinc-coated) fittings on roofs impede the growth of algae. Copper- and zinc-treated shingles are available. Zinc iodide and zinc sulfate are used as topical antiseptics.  Safety  Besides the individual toxic effects of each metal, a wide range of metals are nephrotoxic in humans and/or in animals. Some metals and their compounds are carcinogenic to humans. A few metals, such as lead and mercury, can cross the placental barrier and adversely affect fetal development. Several (cadmium, zinc, copper, and mercury) can induce special protein complexes called metallothioneins.

The youth camp for working-class children was maintained by a number of different groups and organizations, some of which were either openly Communist or had expressed sympathy for the Communist Party's goals. California had a state law, enacted in 1919, that prohibited public display of a red flag.1919 California Penal Code, ¬ß 403a: \\"Any person who displays a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly, or from or on any house, building or window as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government or as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character is guilty of a felony.\\" The BAF persuaded a local sheriff to search the Pioneer Summer Camp. The resultant search turned up a red flag; the sheriff then arrested Yetta Stromberg, a summer teacher at the camp, along with several other employees. Stromberg was a nineteen-year-old student at the University of Southern California, and a member of the Young Communist League, an international organization affiliated with the Communist Party. In the state trials, the charge brought up against her was in relation to a daily ceremony that took place at the summer camp on a loaned ranch near Yucaipa, California, where she worked as a teacher. During the ceremony, Stromberg supervised and directed the youth in raising a red flag, and in pledging allegiance to \\"the workers' red flag, and to the cause for which it stands, one aim throughout our lives, freedom for the working class.\\" Stromberg was also found to have owned a number of books and other printed materials advocating violence and armed uprisings, though she testified that none of such materials were employed in her teaching of the children. Stromberg was tried and convicted in state court. She appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the California statute in question outlawed the symbol of a legally recognized party. Stromberg's attorneys cited Holmes' concept of the \\"clear and present danger\\" test,See Schenck v. United States, . asserting that the circumstances of the act must be considered as part of the decision. The Supreme Court's decision The Court had to consider whether the 1919 California Red Flag Law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In a 7‚Äì2 decision, Chief Justice Hughes followed the logic of the Holmes doctrine introduced in Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), and concluded on 18 May 1931 that the broad red flag ban was too vague, and could be used to disrupt the constitutionally-protected opposition by citizenry to those in power. The California legislature repealed the law in 1933. =Majority opinion= In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the Court considered whether any of the three clauses of the California law, were, as the applicant alleged, a violation of her constitutionally-protected rights. The Court had previously established in a series of cases that the right of free speech is essential to liberty, and is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.See ; ; . The opinion noted, however, that this protection did not extend to forms of expression which may incite violence, crime, or the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. The Court found little reason to question the validity of the second and third clauses of the statute as they pertain to such prohibited forms of expression and concentrated instead on the first clause. The first clause prohibited individuals to display \\"a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly,\\" even when such a red flag did not represent a symbol of opposition to organized government (clause 2) or as a stimulus to anarchistic action (clause 3). Upon examining the vagueness of the statute, the Court concluded that a law so indefinite as to permit the punishment of peaceful and orderly opposition exercised in accordance with legal means and constitutional imitations was \\"repugnant to the guarantee of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" In thus finding the first clause of the statute invalid, the Court set aside the conviction of the appellant, as the conviction appeared to have rested exclusively on that first clause. The Court did not proceed to rule on the constitutionality of the second and third clauses of the statute. =McReynolds' dissent= Associate Justice James C. McReynolds dissented from the Court's opinion. Justice McReynolds argued in his dissent that the Court has, at many times in the past, applied the rule that it may not review any question arising from a state court ruling unless it is shown that the question was determined in the state court or at least duly presented for such a determination. In this specific instance, no such challenges appeared to have been brought. Further, when the case was considered by the Court of Appeals, it held that since the petitioner was charged with violation of all the clauses of the statutes and thus convicted, the conviction could not be reversed even if one of the clauses was found to be invalid. McReynolds agreed with this determination and suggested that the judgment should be affirmed. =Butler's dissent= Justice Butler wrote a detailed dissent in this matter, addressing several different issues. The Court, in the majority opinion, held the first clause of the California statute to be invalid, and as it found that the conviction may have depended exclusively upon that clause, it reversed the state court. Justice Butler, however, believed that the record affirmatively showed that the petitioner was not convicted for violation of the first clause. Prior to the trial of this case, the California Supreme Court had already deemed invalid a city ordinance that would make unlawful the public display of a red flag, emblem, etc.See In re Hartman, 182 Cal. 447, 188 P. 548. Thus, under that decision, the California state courts were already directed to hold invalid the first clause of the statute, as it construed peaceable opposition to organized government. Further, the effect of the instructions given to the jury was to inform them that the defendant had the unlimited right to advocate changes in the government, so long as such advocacy was peaceful; the jury was further informed that any organization peaceably advocating changes in the government could adopt any flag and it was not possible to make that unlawful. The record does not show that the defendant separately challenged in the trial court the validity of the first clause. Defendant's counsel likewise failed to object to state's instructions, and told the Court of Appeals that he was satisfied that the instructions were correct. The Court of Appeals found the second and third provisions of section 403a of the California Penal Code to be in compliance with the state and federal Constitutions' guarantees of freedom of speech. But it stated that the constitutionality of the first clause was \\"questionable,\\" taking particular issue with the phrase \\"of opposition to organized government.\\" The Court of Appeals suggested that this phrase could be eliminated from the section without introducing material changes to its purpose. Justice Butler argued that due consideration makes it clear that the defendant did not claim that the jury could have found her guilty of violating the first clause of the statute; that the Court of Appeals did not rule on the question of whether such a first-clause conviction would be constitutional; and lastly, that the validity of the first clause was mentioned in the concurring opinion only upon the question of whether the second and third clauses must be found invalid if the first clause was to be found unconstitutional. Justice Butler believed that in this case, the Court was not called upon to decide whether the display of the flag constituted constitutionally-protected speech, nor to decide whether such speech was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, nor whether the real or imagined anarchy that could follow a successful opposition to organized government creates a sufficiently compelling reason to prohibit such activities. It appears (though he does not specify it in his dissent) that he viewed the matter as that of procedural challenges, rather than a case of broad protections of freedom of speech.

Biography Parsons' early career began in 1985 with Swans, when he contributed to their Holy Money album. He left Swans in 1987 and joined guitarist Tommy Victor's fledgling Prong. In 1994 he appeared on Buckethead's album Giant Robot. Prong would be Parsons' main project until the group disbanded in 1996. He then started a long-standing friendship with UK composer Justin Broadrick, playing on Godflesh's 1996 tour and their album Hymns. Parsons has also played in Of Cabbages and Kings with former Swans bandmate Algis Kizys and was a one-time member of Foetus touring band. Over the years, he has also recorded with members of Public Image Ltd., The Legendary Pink Dots, Killing Joke and Gator Bait Ten, a project by Science Slam Sonic Explorers, some of whom appear on his recent NIC remix project album. Youth of Killing Joke contributed a remix based on a Glen Brown/Sylford Walker dub tune. Some music journalists have noted that the cover art on the recent NIC remix album appears to be a homage to early Killing Joke art and design style, in particular referencing the nihilistic anti Imperialist/anti war artwork of Mike Coles of Malicious Damage. Parsons is a frequent member of Justin Broadrick's Jesu project, and has his own dub group, Teledubgnosis.

It is the original townsite and was the gambling district of Las Vegas prior to the Strip, and the area still incorporates downtown gaming. As the urban core of the Las Vegas Valley, it features a variety of hotel and business highrises, cultural centers, historical buildings and government institutions, as well as residential and retail developments. Downtown is located in the center of the Las Vegas Valley and just north of the Las Vegas Strip, centered on Fremont Street, the Fremont Street Experience and Fremont East. The city defines the area as bounded by I-15 on the west, Washington Avenue on the north, Maryland Parkway on the east and Sahara Avenue on the south. History Downtown Las Vegas casinos on Fremont Street (1973) Perhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic Paleo-Indians, who traveled to the area 10,000 years ago, leaving behind petroglyphs. Anasazi and Paiute tribes came here at least 2,000 years ago. The area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for the meadows, in the 1800s because it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as desert spring waters for westward travelers. The year 1844 marked the arrival of John C. Fr√©mont, whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas‚Äô Fremont Street is named after him. Eleven years later, members of the LDS Church chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue at the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park. Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when 110 acres of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city. The year 1931 was a pivotal one for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby Hoover Dam. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. It was completed in 1935. Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas. The 1950s saw the opening of the Moulin Rouge Hotel, the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas. In 1951, the first atomic bomb detonation at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, occurred. City residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds until 1963, when the Limited Test Ban Treaty required that nuclear tests be moved underground. During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as \\"gaming,\\" which transitioned into legitimate business. In 1989, entrepreneur Steve Wynn changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up The Mirage, the Las Vegas Strip‚Äôs first mega-casino resort. This strengthened the pull of visitors away from the downtown area. In 1995, the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas‚Äô downtown area was opened. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour. Due to years of revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed ‚ÄúThe Year of Downtown.‚Äù Hundreds of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and Discovery Children‚Äôs Museum, the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex. In 2018, plans for a new downtown expo center were announced, replacing and expanding on space previously provided by the Cashman Center. Neighborhoods and attractions =Fremont Street Casino District= Fremont Street is home to most of downtown's hotels and casinos. These are the original casinos of Las Vegas, which existed before the more famous Las Vegas Strip. The Fremont Street Experience is a canopied street of the downtown area where casinos have been connected to the street and to each other in a unique visual manner. An audio-visual system consisting of more than 2 million lights and a sound system allows for nightly shows. A variety of events also occur at the Experience, including several live concerts. Various entertainment and dining options are also located in the area. =Fremont East Entertainment District= An eclectic range of bars and venues can be found around Fremont East. An artist performing at Beauty Bar on Fremont East Property and business owners have been working to redevelop Fremont Street just east of the Fremont Street Experience. In 2002, the city of Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency joined with Fremont East property and business owners to create a business improvement district, as well as pay for a $5.5 million streetscape improvement. This area is called the Fremont East Entertainment District. It features an eclectic mix of bars, clubs and restaurants. Centered on Las Vegas Boulevard on Fremont Street, this three-block renovation includes pedestrian- friendly street redesign, landscaping and retro-looking neon signage. =The Arts District= Officially called 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District ‚Äì named after the 18 blocks the district originally encompassed ‚Äì this area is home to the city's arts scene with its mix of art galleries, studios and stores. Many arts district stores offer antiques, vintage clothing, high fashion, and mid-20th century furniture/furnishings and other collectible items. Centered on Main Street and Charleston Boulevard, the area hosts the popular First Friday festival every month featuring art, music and other performances. =Symphony Park= Symphony Park is a mixed-use urban district being built on the land to the west of Fremont and Main streets. It will eventually feature a mix of retail, medical, hotel and residential developments. The city of Las Vegas is undertaking the development on of land purchased from the Union Pacific Railroad in 1995. This is a major project for the Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency and the city. Projects that have been completed and are currently operating at Symphony Park are the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and the Discovery Children's Museum. =Las Vegas Medical District= Business and government leaders have begun working on a plan to expand downtown‚Äôs Las Vegas Medical District (LVMD) from its current 200 acres to at least 680 acres. While currently offering the largest concentration of health-care services in the Las Vegas valley, an expanded district would allow for additional health-care services and opportunities. Areas for planned expansion include the Charleston Boulevard corridor to Valley View Boulevard, along Martin L. King Boulevard and in Symphony Park. The centerpiece of this expanded district will be the 260,000-square-foot UNLV School of Medicine, which will include an educational building and library. The school was granted preliminary accreditation in late 2016 and can begin accepting students for its 2017 charter class. =Financial District= Centered on Bonneville Avenue and Casino Center Boulevard, most of this area is filled with office and government buildings. With several court buildings located here, there are many judicial-related businesses such as law firms in the immediate area. The financial district is home to the Las Vegas City Hall building, the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and several bank buildings such as Bank of America. The Clark County Marriage Bureau is also located here at the Regional Justice Center. =Art and culture= Symphony Park Downtown is a hub for arts and culture in the metro area. The main venue for performing arts is the Art Deco-inspired Smith Center for the Performing Arts. In addition to The Smith Center and 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District, there are a number of educational facilities in the Cultural Corridor, located just north of the immediate downtown area. They include the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, the Neon Museum and Boneyard and the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park. Also in this area are a number of neon signs from former Las Vegas casinos and landmarks, which have been restored and installed on several streets around downtown, as well as throughout the Fremont Street Experience. A famous neon icon of downtown Las Vegas is the Vegas Vic sign, also located at the Fremont Street Experience. * The Smith Center for the Performing Arts * The Writer's Block * DISCOVERY Children's Museum * Mob Museum * Neon Museum * Las Vegas Natural History Museum * Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park * \\"Cannabition\\" pop-up museum of marijuana (opening July 1, 2018 and only open to those 21 and over). =Retail= Container Park entrance * Las Vegas North Premium Outlets * Downtown Container Park * Antique & Vintage stores Cityscape Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health =Architecture= Several buildings of architectural significance exist downtown, although being founded in 1905, Las Vegas lacks the number of historical buildings of older cities. Exceptions include the Historic Fifth Street School, built in 1936 in the Spanish-mission style and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also listed is the Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse, which currently serves as home to The Mob Museum and is one of the few historical neoclassical buildings in the city. Built in 1930, the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies and Performing Arts is the city's best example of Art Deco architecture. The Morelli House, built in 1959, is a notable mid-century modern design. The building that formerly housed the Las Vegas City Hall, and now is home to the corporate headquarters for the online retailer Zappos.com, is a notable example of 1970s modern architecture. As Las Vegas boomed, more recent buildings tended to take inspiration from a variety of styles. The Clark County Government Center has a red sandstone exterior invoking a desert motif. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts, opened in 2012, is a more modern example of Art Deco design. Architect Frank Gehry designed the building for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health building in deconstructionist style. It was completed in 2010. =Parks= * Donald W.

Government offices for the city of Las Vegas and Clark County are located here, as well as the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and several courts. Some former government buildings have been turned into attractions, such as the old Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse becoming the Mob Museum. Transportation Regional Transportation Commission provides public transportation Two major freeways‚ÄîInterstate 15 and Interstate 515/U.S. Route 95‚Äîcross in downtown Las Vegas. RTC Transit is a public transportation system providing bus service throughout Las Vegas, including the downtown area. A bus rapid transit link in Las Vegas called the Strip & Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010. It connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center. It stops at the Bonneville Transit Center. Completed in 2012, the transit terminal serves as a central transfer point for downtown and features 16 vehicle bays for buses and 100 bike racks. The Downtown Loop is a free shuttle servicing many attractions in downtown Las Vegas. The Loop runs continuously during operating hours and arrives at each stop every 20 minutes. The hours of operation are Monday through Thursday: 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; Friday through Saturday: 3 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The AAA Free Self-Driving Shuttle is a pilot program that provides rides in the Fremont East Entertainment District Nov 2017 ‚Äì Nov 2018. The pilot program is a partnership with Keolis, the city of Las Vegas, and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. The shuttle runs Tuesday ‚Äì Sunday 4:30pm ‚Äì 8:30pm, with the main station stop at the Downtown Container Park. Shuttle service is suspended during the month of August. Economy The economy of downtown Las Vegas has been primarily based on gambling and entertainment, as is the case in the greater Las Vegas Valley. However, the smaller downtown casinos earn revenues that pale in comparison to the mega resorts on the Las Vegas Strip further south. As of 2014, there have been major renovations of several downtown resorts such as The Plaza, Golden Gate Hotel, Golden Nugget, El Cortez Hotel & Casino, the D and the Downtown Grand. Downtown Las Vegas also houses some corporate offices, as well as the World Market Center Las Vegas, a frequent host of trade shows and conventions. Recently, the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the arrival of the new Zappos headquarters downtown has started to attract new medical and technology-oriented businesses to the area. =Revitalization= The downtown area in recent decades has played second fiddle to the larger and more famous Las Vegas Strip, which is located a few miles to the south. The city has been working on revitalization efforts to entice more visitors and residents to the downtown area. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts World Market Center Las Vegas consists of three giant buildings, with a total of 5.1 million square feet, in a facility designed by Jon Jerde. It is home to semiannual trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries. This is one of several entities that are helping to diversity downtown Las Vegas' economy and job base.World Market Center Las Vegas The square footage of World Market Center Las Vegas is greater than both the Willis Tower in Chicago and the Empire State Building in New York City. The city is also working to attract events to the downtown area. Recently held events include Helldorado and the Life is Beautiful festival. In 2012 several new downtown projects were completed. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts, the new Mob Museum and a new City Hall building opened. The Discovery Children's Museum opened next door to The Smith Center in 2013. The Las Vegas City Hall now operates out of a new building, which, along with the Bonneville Transit center, can serve as an anchor tenant for new development along Main Street.2013 Fiscal Year In Review, city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Projects, \\"A New Downtown Emerges.\\" In addition, Main and Commerce streets in downtown Las Vegas are undergoing major beautification efforts, which started in mid-2014. Online retailer Zappos made major renovations to the old Las Vegas City Hall, and moved into the building in late 2013, which now houses its corporate headquarters. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has taken a personal, as well as a professional, interest in the urban area and is contributing $350 million of his personal wealth toward a multifaceted revitalization effort called the Downtown Project, with businesses like The Writer's Block included among its investments.

The local Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had advocated on behalf of various students expelled by the Ashland School District for drug use in May 2001 at a national forensics tournament, and rallied again to protect the students from an unconstitutional invasion of their privacy. This landmark battle for students' rights was the first of many similar incidents across the country. Students at Ashland High School argued that their off-campus behavior after school hours should have no effect on their academic standing. In a statement to the local press, Ashland High School Student Body Co-President Brady Brim-DeForest said, \\"Teaching kids not to use and abuse drugs and alcohol is a family thing. Ultimately, it's a student's own personal choice.\\" Eventually, the code of conduct was rewritten and the controversy led to a full-scale re-evaluation of the school district's drug and alcohol policy. In order to reach consensus, a community committee was formed, which met consecutively for five months. =Drug policy references= *Daily Tidings (February 2002 coverage) *Daily Tidings (January 2002 coverage) *Daily Tidings (January 2002 coverage) *Daily Tidings (January 2002 coverage) *Daily Tidings (January 2002 coverage) *Mail Tribune (January 2002 coverage) *Mail Tribune (October 2001 coverage) article 1 *Mail Tribune (October 2001 coverage) article 2 *Daily Tidings (September 2001 coverage) *Mail Tribune (September 2001 coverage) *Mail Tribune (July 2001 coverage) article 1 *Mail Tribune (July 2001 coverage) article 2 See also * List of school districts in Oregon References External links * Ashland School District (official website) Category:Ashland, Oregon Category:School districts in Oregon Category:Education in Jackson County, Oregon ","title":"Ashland School District (Oregon)"},{"id":"2095171","text":"Leslie Law (born 5 May 1965) is a British eventer, who won the individual gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. He started riding at age 10, competing with his brother, and participated in his first accredited event in 1982. He attended Lady Hawkins' School, where his passion for riding developed further. By 1989, he was a widely respected competitor, and that year placed 8th at the Badminton Horse Trials. After a period of consolidation, by the late 1990s he was counted amongst the sport's elite, placing in the top ten at Badminton, Burghley and the British Championship on a number of occasions. Biography Born in Hereford, Law began in 1997 to compete on the brothers Shear H2O and Shear L'eau, a pair of Irish Sport Horse greys that made him immediately recognisable on the cross-country course. On the former, he won at Bramham in 1999, came second and third at Badminton in 2000 and 2002, and was a member of the British team that won silver at the 2000 Olympic Games and bronze at the 2002 World Equestrian Games. On Shear L'eau, he won team gold at the European Championship. Their greatest success, however, was at the 2004 Olympics. Tenth after the dressage section, an excellent cross country still left him out of the medals, an inspired clear round in the show jumping saw him awarded the silver medal. However, amid much controversy the result was appealed, as video evidence showed that the gold medalist, German rider Bettina Hoy, had crossed the start line twice, and thus incurred twelve penalty points. By the time the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled against Hoy, promoting Law to the gold, he had returned to England and heard the news that he was Olympic Champion while competing in the Solihull Horse Trials.

The style and Bath stone used are typical of much of the city. Bath Stone is an oolitic limestone comprising granular fragments of calcium carbonate. Originally obtained from the Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines under Combe Down, Somerset, England, its warm, honey colouring gives the World Heritage City of Bath, England, its distinctive appearance. An important feature of Bath Stone is that it is a 'freestone', so-called because it can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers. Bath Stone has been used extensively as a building material throughout southern England, for churches, houses, and public buildings such as railway stations. Some quarries are still in use, but the majority have been converted to other purposes or are being filled in. Geological formation Bath Stone is an oolitic limestone comprising granular fragments of calcium carbonate laid down during the Jurassic Period (195 to 135 million years ago) when the region that is now Bath was under a shallow sea. Layers of marine sediment were deposited, and individual spherical grains were coated with lime as they rolled around the sea bed, forming the Bathonian Series of rocks. Under the microscope, these grains or ooliths (egg stones) are sedimentary rock formed from ooids: spherical grains composed of concentric layers. That name derives from the Hellenic word √≤oion for egg. Strictly, oolites consist of ooids of diameter 0.25‚Äì2 mm. Rocks composed of ooids larger than 2 mm are called pisolites. They frequently contain minute fragments of shell or rock, and sometimes even decayed skeletons of marine life. Bath stone was taken from the Bath Oolite Member and the Combe Down Member of the Chalfield Oolite Formation, part of the Great Oolite Group. Use as a building stone An old crane at Freshford Quarry An important feature of Bath Stone is that it is a freestone, that is one that can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers. In the Roman and Medieval periods, Bath Stone was extensively used on domestic, ecclesiastical and civil engineering projects such as bridges. The Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, which was founded in 1738, was designed by John Wood the Elder, and built with Bath stone donated by Allen. It is a Grade II listed building. There is a fine pediment on the building, in Bath stone, which depicts the parable of the good Samaritan. St Stephens church, situated on Lansdown Hill in Bath, was constructed from a limestone sourced from the Limpley Stoke mine, which is situated in the Limpley Stoke Valley. The church has recently been restored. Arno's Court Triumphal Arch The material has also been used widely outside Bath itself. Claverton Pumping Station at Claverton, which was built of Bath Stone in about 1810, pumps water from the River Avon to the Kennet and Avon Canal, using power from the flow of the River Avon. The stone was also used for the Dundas Aqueduct, which is long, and has three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end. Much of Bristol Cathedral was built of Bath Stone, and the Wills Tower, which is the dominant feature of the Wills Memorial Building, is constructed in reinforced concrete faced with Bath and Clipsham stone. Bristol's Cabot Tower was also faced with Bath Stone. Arno's Court Triumphal Arch was built from Bath stone in about 1760, and was later dismantled before being rebuilt in its current location. Bath Stone was also favoured by architect Hans Price, who designed much of 19th century Weston- super-Mare. In Barnstable, the 1855 construction of Butchers Row used Bath Stone. In London, the neo-classical Georgian mansion Lancaster House was built from Bath Stone in 1825 for the Duke of York and Albany, the second son of King George III, as was St Luke's Church, Chelsea in 1824, and several other churches, including Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury, were built from the material. Apsley House, the town house of the Dukes of Wellington, was remodelled by the 1st Duke, using in Bath Stone cladding over the original red brick. In Reading, the original building of the Royal Berkshire Hospital of 1839, together with the wings added in the 1860s, are built of Bath Stone, with slate roofs. They are now listed grade II* by English Heritage. In 1860, the nearby Reading railway station, incorporating a tower and clock, was constructed by the Great Western Railway using Bath Stone, and the company also used it for Chippenham railway station. Tyntesfield Other mansions which have used Bath Stone include: Gatcombe Park, Goldney Hall, Tyntesfield, South Hill Park, Spetchley Park. In 2002 the East End of Truro Cathedral was completely renovated and restored with some of the ornate Bath Stone replaced with harder-wearing Syreford stone. In 2005 the West Front was restored similarly. Both projects were supervised by MRDA Architects of London, the Cathedral architects. Mines Bath Stone was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, in Somerset; and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at various locations in Wiltshire, including Box and Corsham. In the early 18th century, Ralph Allen promoted the use of the stone in Bath itself, and demonstrated its potential by using it for his own mansion at Prior Park. Following a failed bid to supply stone to buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would show off the properties of Bath Stone as a building material. He acquired the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. Hitherto, the quarry masons had always hewn stone roughly providing blocks of varying size. Wood required stone blocks to be cut with crisp, clean edges for his distinctive classical fa√ßades. The distinctive honey-coloured Bath Stone was used to build the Georgian city. Stone was extracted by the \\"room and pillar\\" method, by which chambers were mined, leaving pillars of stone to support the roof. Allen built a railway line from his mine on Combe Down which carried the stone down the hill, now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport stone to London.Durman pp91-94 In the 18th century mines at Budbury near Bradford on Avon and Corsham the mines were developed by the Methuen and Northey families. The mine at Monkton Farleigh was leased to quarrymen by the Diocese of Salisbury. Underground extraction of Bath Stone continues in the Corsham area but on a smaller scale than previously. For example, Hanson Bath & Portland Stone, part of the HeidelbergCement Group, operates Hartham Park Underground Quarry in the Hudswell district (southwest of Pickwick). The Bath Stone Group operates the Stoke Hill mine. =Box Mine= The Box Mine consists of a network of tunnels, which originate from stone mining work. Stone extraction started during the Roman occupation of Britain and ceased in 1968. The mine is now popular for recreational underground trips, and is home to a large population of bats. Up to 10% of the total British population of greater horseshoe bat uses the mine at times, and a maximum of 230 individuals of the species have been counted at the site. The Lesser Horseshoe Bat also uses the mine, as do the four Myotis species: Whiskered, Brandt's, Natterer's and Daubenton's bats. =Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines= tramway Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines date from the 17th and 18th century when stone was extracted by the \\"room and pillar\\" method, by which chambers were mined, leaving pillars of stone between them to support the roof. The mine contains a range of mine features including well preserved tramways, cart-roads and crane bases. The walls and pillars of the mine are studded with pick and tool marks, and show evidence of the use of huge stone saws, all of which bear testimony to the variety of techniques used to extract the stone over the mine's three hundred-year history. No mine abandonment plans of either the tunnels or the caverns, known as voids, were made prior to the 1872 Mining Act. Following their closure, the mines were used for a variety of purposes, including a mushroom farm, and as an air-raid shelter during the World War II Baedeker raids on Bath. Other uses of stone mines During the 1930s there was a recognition of a need to provide secure storage for munitions in the south of the United Kingdom, and a large area of the quarries around the Corsham area was renovated by the Royal Engineers as one of three major munitions stockpiles. This ammunition depot was serviced by a spur railway line from the main London to Bristol line, branching off just outside the eastern entrance to Box Tunnel. A portion of the underground quarry complex was developed as a 'shadow factory' for aircraft engines, to act as a fallback should the Bristol Engine company Factory at Filton be taken out of action by hostile bombing. In practice this factory was never used. The Operations Room at RAF Fighter Command's No. 10 Group Headquarters, Rudloe Manor (RAF Box), Wiltshire, showing WAAF plotters and duty officers at work, 1943. In another part of the quarry area, Royal Air Force Box was established as the Headquarters of No10 Fighter Group, Royal Air Force. RAF Box was later renamed RAF Rudloe Manor and expanded to encompass a number of communications functions, including No1 Signal Unit, Controller Defence Communications Network, No1001 Signal Unit Detachment and Headquarters RAF Provost & Security Service. No1SU and CDCN were both housed in bunkers within the quarry complex, which also included an RAF Regional Command Centre for the South West of England. British defence doctrine during the early Cold War period indicated a requirement for a fallback location for central government outside London, to assume national control in the event of London being destroyed. The quarry complex at Corsham was chosen for this location and development of the site commenced in the 1950s. In the event of an imminent nuclear attack, it was assumed that the government would be evacuated from London by rail or helicopter. The facility would provide a safe haven for the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, commanders of the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and British Army and supporting civil servants and military personnel. Facilities inside the complex included accommodation and catering for nearly 4,000 people, including a hospital, organic electrical generation and the ability to seal the complex from the outside environment, contaminated by radiation or other threat. The defence facilities known by various code names like Stockwell, Turnstile, Hawthorn and Burlington have been built in quarries include Military Command & Control, storage and a fallback seat of national government. Some areas of the quarry complex were hardened and provided with support measures to ensure resilience in the event of a nuclear attack. The site was decommissioned and placed in a state of care & maintenance in the mid 1990s following the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war. The site has been offered for sale, conditional on a Private Finance Initiative for the continued use of above ground facilities. Corsham Computer Centre was built into Hudswell Quarry during the 1980s and current examples of other uses include not only defence establishments, but also a wine cellar at Eastlays (near Gastard)Corsham Cellars at Octavian Vaults corporate web site.

Retrieved on 16 March 2008 The mine at Monkton Farleigh was used as a Central Ammunition Depot during World War II. Part of the site which was not used by the military is now a part of the Brown's Folly site of special scientific interest. Mine rehabilitation During 1989 a utilities contractor unexpectedly broke through into part of the mines complex at Combe Down whilst excavating a trench. This raised concerns locally, resulting in the then Bath City Council commissioning studies to survey the condition of the mines. It was clear that the mines were in a very dangerous state and some experts considered them to be the largest, shallowest, and most unstable of their kind in Europe. Approximately 80% of the mines, which are up to high and cover a total area of about , had less than cover and as little as in some places. In March 1999, the then Department of Environment, Transport and Regions (DETR), now known as the Department for Communities and Local Government, announced a Land Stabilisation Programme, based on the Derelict Land Act 1982. A Parliamentary Statutory Instrument (2002 No. 2053) was needed before the work could be undertaken. Foam Concrete was selected as the best material to use in the large-scale infilling of the old mine workings. Over of foamed concrete were placed in the shallower underground mines, making it the single largest application of foamed concrete in the United Kingdom.

A trapped ion quantum computer is one proposed approach to a large-scale quantum computer. Ions, or charged atomic particles, can be confined and suspended in free space using electromagnetic fields. Qubits are stored in stable electronic states of each ion, and quantum information can be transferred through the collective quantized motion of the ions in a shared trap (interacting through the Coulomb force). Lasers are applied to induce coupling between the qubit states (for single qubit operations) or coupling between the internal qubit states and the external motional states (for entanglement between qubits). The fundamental operations of a quantum computer have been demonstrated experimentally with the currently highest accuracy in trapped ion systems. Promising schemes in development to scale the system to arbitrarily large numbers of qubits include transporting ions to spatially distinct locations in an array of ion traps, building large entangled states via photonically connected networks of remotely entangled ion chains, and combinations of these two ideas. This makes the trapped ion quantum computer system one of the most promising architectures for a scalable, universal quantum computer. As of April 2018, the largest number of particles to be controllably entangled is 20 trapped ions. The Paul ion trap Classical linear Paul trap in Innsbruck for a string of Calcium ions. The electrodynamic ion trap currently used in trapped ion quantum computing research was invented in the 1950s by Wolfgang Paul (who received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1989http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1989/illpres/trap.html). Charged particles cannot be trapped in 3D by just electrostatic forces because of Earnshaw's theorem. Instead, an electric field oscillating at radio frequency (RF) is applied, forming a potential with the shape of a saddle spinning at the RF frequency. If the RF field has the right parameters (oscillation frequency and field strength), the charged particle becomes effectively trapped at the saddle point by a restoring force, with the motion described by a set of Mathieu equations. This saddle point is the point of minimized energy magnitude, E(\\\\overrightarrow{x}), for the ions in the potential field. The Paul trap is often described as a harmonic potential well that traps ions in two dimensions (assume \\\\widehat{x } and \\\\widehat{y} without loss of generality) and does not trap ions in the \\\\widehat{z} direction. When multiple ions are at the saddle point and the system is at equilibrium, the ions are only free to move in \\\\widehat{z}. Therefore, the ions will repel each other and create a vertical configuration in \\\\widehat{z}, the simplest case being a linear strand of only a few ions. Coulomb interactions of increasing complexity will create a more intricate ion configuration if many ions are initialized in the same trap. Furthermore, the additional vibrations of the added ions greatly complicate the quantum system, which makes initialization and computation more difficult. Once trapped, the ions should be cooled such that k_BT\\\\ll\\\\hbar\\\\omega_z(see Lamb Dicke regime). This can be achieved by a combination of Doppler cooling and Resolved sideband cooling. At this very low temperature, vibrational energy in the ion trap is quantized into phonons by the energy eigenstates of the ion strand, which are called the center of mass vibrational modes. A single phonon's energy is given by the relation \\\\hbar\\\\omega_z. These quantum states occur when the trapped ions vibrate together and are completely isolated from the external environment. If the ions are not properly isolated, noise can result from ions interacting with external electromagnetic fields, which creates random movement and destroys the quantized energy states. History of trapped ion quantum computing The first implementation scheme for a controlled-NOT quantum gate was proposed by Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller in 1995, specifically for the trapped ion system. The same year, a key step in the controlled-NOT gate was experimentally realized at NIST Ion Storage Group, and research in quantum computing began to take off worldwide. Many traditional ion trapping research groups have made the transition to quantum computing research, while, more recently, many other new research groups have joined the effort. An enormous amount of progress in this field has been made in the past decade and trapped ions remain a leading candidate for quantum computation. Requirements for quantum computation Magnesium ions in a trap. The full requirements for a functional quantum computer are not entirely known, but there are many generally accepted requirements. DiVincenzo outlined several of these criterion for quantum computing (see DiVincenzo's criteria). =Qubits= Any two-level quantum system can form a qubit, and there are two predominant ways to form a qubit using the electronic states of an ion: # Two ground state hyperfine levels (these are called \\"hyperfine qubits\\") # A ground state level and an excited level (these are called the \\"optical qubits\\") Hyperfine qubits are extremely long-lived (decay time of the order of thousands to millions of years) and phase/frequency stable (traditionally used for atomic frequency standards). Optical qubits are also relatively long-lived (with a decay time of the order of a second), compared to the logic gate operation time (which is of the order of microseconds). The use of each type of qubit poses its own distinct challenges in the laboratory. =Initialization= Ionic qubit states can be prepared in a specific qubit state using a process called optical pumping. In this process, a laser couples the ion to some excited states which eventually decay to one state which is not coupled to the laser. Once the ion reaches that state, it has no excited levels to couple to in the presence of that laser and, therefore, remains in that state. If the ion decays to one of the other states, the laser will continue to excite the ion until it decays to the state that does not interact with the laser. This initialization process is standard in many physics experiments and can be performed with extremely high fidelity (>99.9%). The system's initial state for quantum computation can therefore be described by the ions in their hyperfine and motional ground states, resulting in an initial center of mass phonon state of 0\\\\rangle(zero phonons). =Measurement= Measuring the state of the qubit stored in an ion is quite simple. Typically, a laser is applied to the ion that couples only one of the qubit states. When the ion collapses into this state during the measurement process, the laser will excite it, resulting in a photon being released when the ion decays from the excited state. After decay, the ion is continually excited by the laser and repeatedly emits photons. These photons can be collected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. If the ion collapses into the other qubit state, then it does not interact with the laser and no photon is emitted. By counting the number of collected photons, the state of the ion may be determined with a very high accuracy (>99.9%).Citation Needed =Arbitrary single qubit rotation= One of the requirements of universal quantum computing is to coherently change the state of a single qubit. For example, this can transform a qubit starting out in 0 into any arbitrary superposition of 0 and 1 defined by the user. In a trapped ion system, this is often done using magnetic dipole transitions or stimulated Raman transitions for hyperfine qubits and electric quadrupole transitions for optical qubits. The term \\"rotation\\" alludes to the Bloch sphere representation of a qubit pure state. Gate fidelity can be greater than 99%. The operations R_x(\\\\theta)and R_y(\\\\theta)can be applied to individual ions by manipulating the frequency of an external electromagnetic field from and exposing the ions to the field for specific amounts of time. These controls create a Hamiltonian of the form H_I^i=\\\\hbar\\\\Omega/2(S_+\\\\exp(i\\\\phi)+S_-\\\\exp(-i\\\\phi)). Here, S_+and S_-are the raising and lowering operators of spin (see Ladder operator). These rotations are the universal building blocks for single-qubit gates in quantum computing. To obtain the Hamiltonian for the ion-laser interaction, apply the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings model. Once the Hamiltonian is found, the formula for the unitary operation performed on the qubit can be derived using the principles of quantum time evolution. Although this model utilizes the Rotating wave approximation, it proves to be effective for the purposes of trapped-ion quantum computing. =Two qubit entangling gates= Besides the controlled-NOT gate proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 1995, many equivalent, but more robust, schemes have been proposed and implemented experimentally since. Recent theoretical work by Garcia-Ripoll, Cirac, and Zoller have shown that there are no fundamental limitations to the speed of entangling gates, but gates in this impulsive regime (faster than 1 microsecond) have not yet been demonstrated experimentally. The fidelity of these implementations has been greater than 99%. =Scalable trap designs= Quantum computers must be capable of initializing, storing, and manipulating many qubits at once in order to solve difficult computational problems. However, as previously discussed, a finite number of qubits can be stored in each trap while still maintaining their computational abilities. It is therefore necessary to design interconnected ion traps that are capable of transferring information from one trap to another. Ions can be separated from the same interaction region to individual storage regions and brought back together without losing the quantum information stored in their internal states. Ions can also be made to turn corners at a \\"T\\" junction, allowing a two dimensional trap array design. Semiconductor fabrication techniques have also been employed to manufacture the new generation of traps, making the 'ion trap on a chip' a reality. An example is the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) designed by Kielpinski, Monroe, and Wineland. QCCDs resemble mazes of electrodes with designated areas for storing and manipulating qubits. The variable electric potential created by the electrodes can both trap ions in specific regions and move them through the transport channels, which negates the necessity of containing all ions in a single trap. Ions in the QCCD's memory region are isolated from any operations and therefore the information contained in their states is kept for later use. Gates, including those that entangle two ion states, are applied to qubits in the interaction region by the method already described in this article.  Decoherence in Scalable Traps  When an ion is being transported between regions in an interconnected trap and is subjected to a nonuniform magnetic field, decoherence can occur in the form of the equation below (see Zeeman effect). This is effectively changes the relative phase of the quantum state. The up and down arrows correspond to a general superposition qubit state, in this case the ground and excited states of the ion. \\\\left\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow \\\\exp(i\\\\alpha)\\\\left\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle Additional relative phases could arise from physical movements of the trap or the presence of unintended electric fields. If the user could determine the parameter Œ±, accounting for this decoherence would be relatively simple, as known quantum information processes exist for correcting a relative phase. However, since Œ± from the interaction with the magnetic field is path- dependent, the problem is highly complex. Considering the multiple ways that decoherence of a relative phase can be introduced in an ion trap, reimagining the ion state in a new basis that minimizes decoherence could be a way to eliminate the issue. One way to combat decoherence is to represent the quantum state in a new basis called the Decoherence Free Subspace, or DFS., with basis states \\\\left\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow\\\\right\\\\rangle and \\\\left\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow\\\\right\\\\rangle. The DFS is actually the subspace of two ion states, such that if both ions acquire the same relative phase, the total quantum state in the DFS will be unaffected. = Overall analysis of DiVincenzo's criteria = Trapped ion quantum computers theoretically meet all of DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing, but implementation of the system can be quite difficult. The main challenges facing trapped ion quantum computing are the initialization of the ion's motional states, and the relatively brief lifetimes of the phonon states. Decoherence also proves to be challenging to eliminate, and is caused when the qubits interact with the external environment undesirably.  CNOT gate implementation  The Controlled NOT gate is a crucial component for quantum computing, as any quantum gate can be created by a combination of CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations. It is therefore important that a trapped-ion quantum computer can perform this operation by meeting the following three requirements. First, the trapped ion quantum computer must be able to perform arbitrary rotations on qubits, which are already discussed in the \\"arbitrary single-qubit rotation\\" section. The next component of a CNOT gate is the controlled phase-flip gate, or the controlled-Z gate (see Quantum logic gate). In a trapped ion quantum computer, the state of the center of mass phonon functions as the control qubit, and the internal atomic spin state of the ion is the working qubit. The phase of the working qubit will therefore be flipped if the phonon qubit is in the state 1\\\\rangle. Lastly, a SWAP gate must be implemented, acting on both the ion state and the phonon state. Two alternate schemes to represent the CNOT gates are presented in Chuang's Quantum Computation and Quantum Information and Cirac and Zoller's \\"Quantum Computation with Cold_trapped Ions\\".

It is an out-and-back roller coaster with more than one mile (1.6 km) of track. Its first hill is with a 60 degree drop, and reaches speeds of up to . Wild Thing's height was set by the FAA, due to the nearby presence of Flying Cloud Airport. Designed and manufactured by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, it was the first hypercoaster to be built by the company, opening in 1996. It was the 5th tallest coaster in the world when it opened. The ride's success led to the construction of Steel Force at Dorney Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 1997 and Mamba at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Missouri the next year. The ride Wild Thing's lift hill After the ascent to the top of the 207 ft (63.1m) lift hill, the train plunges down the 196 ft (59.7 m) drop, reaching the maximum speed of 74 mph (119.1 km/h). The train then enters a 103 ft (31.4m) parabolic hill, resulting in one of the longest low gravity sections of any coaster in the world. After the hill, the train climbs a larger 130 ft (39.6m) hill and turns left followed by a large figure-eight turnaround. The train then makes a s-turn into a mid-course brake run. followed by several airtime hills, two of which are inside a tunnel where riders are photographed via on-ride camera. The train is led into a final brake run followed by a right turn back into the station. Accidents Several minor injuries occurred following a derailment on the Wild Thing on May 21, 2006 when a brake mount came loose. The accident happened in the mid brake, where a train waits to enter the station following a run. The failed brake mount struck the rear axle of the train's fifth car, causing the sixth car to detach from the train and de-rail on one side. 14 people were taken to St. Francis Regional Medical Center, but all were released the same day with minor or no injuries. Contrary to widespread rumors, neither the train, the cars, or any of the riders fell from the track. All riders were wearing their required seat belts and lap bars, preventing them from being ejected from their car. The sixth car did not completely derail from the track, rather settling in a leaning position on its right side. Wild Thing reopened on June 1, 2006, after being judged safe by inspectors.

In 1913 the British Deperdussin Aeroplane Company tested a newly developed seaplane at Osea. It was a single-engined seaplane with two large floats. It was piloted by John Cyril Porte, the managing director of the company, and took off from the deep water channel to the south of the island. It had a successful ten-minute flight. Osea Island was the site of a Coastal Motor Torpedo Boat base during the First World War and 2,000 sailors were billeted there, mainly in temporary huts which were removed after the war. Augustus Agar was awarded the Victoria Cross while stationed on the island and detailed his experiences in his book Baltic Episode.Baltic Episode (Augustus Agar) Naval Institute Press, 1963 In the Second World War, the island was occupied by the British Army. =Filming= The 1979 Children's Film Foundation film Black Island, produced by Kingsgate Films and directed by Ben Bolt, was shot on and around the island. The film is about two young castaways who are captured by escaped convicts on the island and their subsequent escape attempts. Both the 1989 television adaptation of Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black and the 2012 film adaptation of the same used the island's causeway as the location for the fictional Nine Lives Causeway. The island was used for auditions on the ITV1 show Superstar, filmed in early 2012, in which it was known as Superstar Island. It was the second episode and included eliminations. Andrew Lloyd Webber was casting for a new lead role, in his production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Melanie Chisholm, Dawn French and Jason Donovan were also on the panel.

Objective Command of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division had temporarily fallen to its executive officer, First Lieutenant Richard Winters. After linking up with his parent unit at the hamlet of Le Grand Chemin on the morning of 6 June 1944, Winters was ordered away from his company. With minimal instructions of \\"There's fire along that hedgerow there. Take care of it,\\" and no briefing, Winters found himself given the task of destroying a German artillery battery. The battery had initially been reported to be 10.5 cm leFH 18s firing onto causeway exit #2 leading off Utah Beach and disrupting landing forces of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division advancing inland on this route. Several other units had stumbled onto the German position earlier in the morning and had been repulsed. Winters undertook a reconnaissance at about 0830hrs, after which he collected a team of 12 men from his own and other companies. Beyond knowledge of the general location of the gun emplacements south of Le Grand Chemin and without information of the other side of the hedgerow, Winters' team attacked Br√©court Manor, located three miles southwest of Utah Beach and north of the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. There he discovered No. 6 Battery of the 90th Artillery Regiment, consisting of four 105 mm howitzers connected by trenches and defended by a company of soldiers.The artillery battalions of the 91st Luftlandedivision were equipped with a mountain howitzer, the 10.5 cm Gebirgshaubitze 40, whose ammunition was not interchangeable with that of the standard 105mm field howitzer, and which had one unit of fire (\\"basic load\\") available on D-Day. Winters believed that the unit was part of the 6th Fallschirmj√§gerregiment (\\"6th Parachute Regiment\\") with emplaced MG42 machine guns. The 1st battalion of the 6th had been ordered to Sainte Marie-du-Mont from Carentan during the afternoon but arrived after dark. The 1st Company 919th Grenadier Regiment (709th Infantry Division) was posted at Sainte Marie- du-Mont and was responsible for the area. Elements of 1058th Grenadier Regiment (91st Luftlandedivision) were defending throughout the vicinity,A company of III./1058 defended Pouppeville, the town a mile away astride beach exit #1 and the artillery was part of this division also. The 795th Georgian Battalion, attached to the 709th ID, was to the northwest at Turqueville but is less likely to have been present because of terrain difficulties. Whichever unit defended the battery, the U.S. paratroopers were opposed by about 60 German soldiers. The crew originally assigned to the four 105mm guns had apparently deserted during the night of the airborne landings. Oberstleutnant Friedrich von der Heydte of the German 6th Parachute Regiment, who was observing the landings at Utah Beach, learned that they had been abandoned, and traveled to Carentan, where he ordered his 1st Battalion to occupy and hold Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and Br√©court, and find men to work on the artillery battery. Battle Upon arrival at the battery location, Winters made his plan: he positioned a pair of M1919 machine guns for covering fire and sent several soldiers (2d Lt. Lynn D. Compton, Pvt. Donald Malarkey and Sgt. William J. Guarnere) to one flank to destroy a machine gun position with grenades and provide covering fire. While the trenches connecting the artillery positions provided the Germans with an easy way to supply and reinforce the guns, they also proved to be their biggest weakness. After destroying the first gun position, Winters and the rest of his team used the trenches as covered approaches to attack the remaining guns in turn. Each gun was destroyed by placing a block of TNT down its barrel and using German stick grenades to set off the charges. Reinforcements from Company D, led by 2d Lt. Ronald C. Speirs, arrived to complete the assault on the fourth and last gun. Speirs had a reputation as an excellent and extremely aggressive officer, and he led his men against the last gun position by running outside the trenches, exposing himself to enemy fire. After the four guns were disabled, Winters's team came under heavy machine-gun fire from Br√©court Manor and withdrew. He had discovered a German map in one gun position that was marked with the locations of all German artillery and machine gun positions throughout that area of the Cotentin Peninsula. This was an invaluable piece of intelligence, and once Winters returned to Le Grand Chemin, he passed it on to the 2nd Battalion intelligence officer (S-2), who passed the information up the chain of command. Command was so thrilled with the information provided by Winters that it sent the first two tanks to reach Utah Beach to support the paratroopers.\\"The Battle at Br√©court Manor\\", History Channel Winters also directed the fire of two American tanks which arrived later from Utah Beach to eliminate remaining German resistance. Winters lost one man, Pfc. John D. Halls (of A Company) from an 81mm mortar platoon;In Biggest Brother: The Life of Major Dick Winters, The Man Who Led the Band of Brothers, the biography written by Larry Alexander, Winters remembers the man as John D. Hall of A Company, whom he had coached on the regimental basketball team as the HBO series indicates. another, Private Robert \\"Popeye\\" Wynn, was wounded during the attack.Wynn was evacuated back to England, recovered from his wound and rejoined Easy Company just before Operation Market Garden. Another casualty was Warrant Officer Andrew Hill, who was killed when he came upon the battle while searching for the headquarters of the 506th PIR. Also killed were Sgt. \\"Rusty\\" Houck from F Company, who was with Speirs, and one soldier from D Company under Speirs' command. Another soldier from D Company was wounded. Aftermath Troops landing at Utah Beach had a relatively easy landing, due in part to this successful assault. Colonel Robert Sink, the commander of the 506th PIR, recommended Winters for the Medal of Honor, but the award was downgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross because there was a policy of awarding only one Medal of Honor per division; in the 101st's case, to Lieutenant Colonel Robert G. Cole. There was later a campaign to upgrade Winters' Distinguished Service Cross to the Medal of Honor, but a bill to do so, H.R. 796, died in committee at the end of the 110th United States Congress. It was not reintroduced by its sponsor, Tim Holden. The official Army history of these events on D-Day is quiet about the battle. Army historian S. L. A. Marshall interviewed Winters about the attack, but the interview was not private ‚Äì many of Winters' superior officers were present ‚Äì and, according to his memoir Beyond Band of Brothers, he may have downplayed his description of the event to avoid personal accolade and to keep the account succinct. In fact, Marshall stated in his report that Winters had about 200 men under his command. However, nearly every man involved was later recognized for his role in the attack. A documentary produced by filmmaker and trial attorney Vance Day titled \\"The Battle at Brecourt Manor\\" was premiered in August 2010 in Salem, Oregon during an event for Donald Malarkey who served in Easy Company and during the engagement at Brecourt Manor. Day is a good friend of Malarkey's and the two traveled extensively to conduct Frontline Leadership seminars around the country, primarily for law enforcement, military, and leadership organizations.

The feature is centered at 30.5¬∞ North Latitude, 326.8¬∞ West Longitude and is approximately 383 kilometers long. Samarkand Sulci consists of three parts. The southern and eastern extensions bound Sarandib Planitia on its western and northern sides, respectively. The northern portions extends into a region of cratered terrain. Using Voyager 2 images, Kargel and Pozio (1996) found that the northern and southern/eastern extensions of this feature are likely distinct features with different origins and ages. The portions surrounding Sarandib Planitia were characterized as sinuous \\"mountainous ridges\\" 1-1.5 km in height, and lying within relative topographic lows. Kargel and Pozio (1996) suggested that they might be fold belts, similar to North America's Appalachian Mountains. The northern portion of Samarkand Sulci was found to consist of linear fractures, suggesting that rather than a compressional fold belt, the northern part of Samarkand Sulci may in fact be an extensional rift. Based on analysis of crater counts in both areas of Samarkand Sulci, Kargel and Pozio (1996) suggested that the rift formed before the ridges. Recent images by the Cassini spacecraft show portions of Samarkand Sulci at much higher resolution than in the Voyager 2 images. Numerous parallel ridges are resolved in the southern and eastern extensions of the feature, though some ridges appear chevron shaped. Just as Kargel and Pozio (1996) found parts of this feature lying within topographic lows, sharp scarps bound the ridge belts in several regions. On the far eastern tip of Samarkand Sulci, these scarps begin to converge as the ridge belts disappear, forming narrow canyons. Northern Samarkand Sulci was also observed. This region appears unconsolidated with several craters, like Ahmad and Peri-Banu, appearing to be cross-cut or even flooded by this portion of Samarkand Sulci. Near the southern end of Samarkand Sulci, curious dark patches, 500‚Äì750 m across were observed lying along ridge crests. It is possible these spots may be collapse pits. Samarkand Sulci is named after the country ruled over by Shah Zaman, brother of Shahryar, in Arabian Nights.

He spent some time in an orphanage, where he was bewildered when the head told him he would be the Earl of Essex someday. This interest was revived when many years later, he received a newspaper clipping from a friend saying that the heir to the Earls of Essex might be an American, Bladen Horace Capell. This led to an exhaustive search by de Vere Capell with much correspondence with many distant and formerly unknown relatives. Eventually, he managed to prove that his great-grandfather Algernon Capell was the elder brother of Bladen's great-great-grandfather Adolphus Capell.

Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Guwanges gameplay contains elements that are unique or uncommon in the vertically scrolling shooting game genre. The screen will often scroll horizontally or even diagonally, depending on the course the protagonist must take to reach the demon leader. Each character has a limited bomb attack in the form of an energy blast that can be sent in any direction, and will dispel any bullets it touches. Another special attack involves sending the shikigami into the midst of the enemies, with two particular advantages. First, the shikigami does not have to attack in the same direction as the player is firing, and can even get past obstacles that would otherwise thwart normal shots. If an enemy projectile touches the shikigami, it will change to a pink color and will drastically slow down. If the shot passes the shikigami, it will return to its original color and resume at full speed; however, if the bullet is caught in an explosion, it will be cancelled and turned into coins. Score is almost entirely dependent on the continuous, uninterrupted collection of coins. The player must constantly damage or destroy enemies in order to replenish a countdown timer; when the timer (represented by a meter in the upper-left corner of the screen) depletes entirely, the player's coin count returns to zero. Guwange is unique in that the player may maintain a \\"chain\\" of coin collection throughout the entire game, instead of a more conventional stage-by-stage approach. This makes Guwange's scoring system extremely unforgiving. ;Bosses *Fujimura Shizuhiko (Stage 1 boss) (age 24). Bearer of the wood talisman. Although Fujimura appears to be an ordinary female dancer, this is not the case. \\"She\\" is actually a man named Fujihara Motohiko, who has accepted demonic power to get revenge on the clan that destroyed his family. The attendant dancers are actually demons assigned to assist Fujihara in his revenge, and to kill him if he shows signs of wanting to relinquish his power and reclaim his humanity. *Madaramukade (Stage 2 boss). Bearer of the fire talisman. *Nekogumo (Stage 3 boss). A horrific monster, part cat and part spider, and bearer of the earth talisman. She uses an abandoned temple for her lair, devouring any traveler hapless enough to come near. *Kemonoyajiro (Stage 4 boss). A mysterious shrine that has been possessed by a man-eating demon, and is powered by the metal talisman. *Ashikaga Sukouji (Stage 5 boss, phase 1). A descendant of one of the architects of the Ashikaga shogunate. However, because of his illegitimacy, his birth father condemned him as a \\"monkey's child\\", and banished him to live with a priest as an ascetic. When the priest died, he revealed the truth of Sukouji's parentage. Enraged, Sukouji assaulted his father's castle, empowered by Magira, the monkey demon whom Sukouji's father had unwittingly invited with his curse. Once Sukouji took the castle for his own, it became increasingly known for demonic associations, only intensifying when Fujihara entrusted the water talisman to Sukouji. *Magira (Stage 5 boss, phase 2) *Guwange-sama (Stage 6 boss, phases 1-2) *Amagizu (age 400+) and Mikoto (age 5) (Stage 6 bosses, phase 3) Amagizu was a nun who was persecuted by the bakufu four centuries ago, and attempted to take refuge to give birth on the mountain that would be called Gokumon. As she bore her child, though, Guwange took the opportunity to possess it, transfiguring it into a demonic form and absorbing Amagizu's lower body. Since then, they have remained in this combined state, with Amagizu voicing Guwange's will to his subordinates. Mikoto, the daughter of Shishin, showed great spiritual power from her birth. Two years ago, though, she was discovered by Amagizu, and taken prisoner by her agents. Amagizu has been using Mikoto's power to amplify her and Guwange's own power, increasing their influence over the spirit realm and an ever- greater portion of Japan. Meanwhile, rumors of Mikoto's power have spread throughout the Ashikaga shogunate, and various lords have attempted to capture her from Gokumon in order to take that power for her own. Not a single person sent to capture her has come back from Gokumon alive. Plot The story of Guwange is set during the Muromachi period of Japan. During this time, increasing numbers of people suffer possession by shikigami. Although the shikigami grant great spiritual powers, the strain inflicted on the host causes them to die exactly one year after possession. However, a legend has sprung up regarding Guwange, the malevolent god trapped in Mt. Gokumon (i.e. Hell Gate). If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements‚Äîwood, fire, earth, metal, water‚Äîfrom five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death. ;Characters *Shishin (age 35), with shikigami Rikiou (age 500+). Attacks with kunai. Unlike most hosts of shikigami, Shishin has been able to live for more than a year after possession. This is because Rikiou has made an effort to keep Shishin alive, so long as he kills other humans for Rikiou to devour. The fact that Shishin never speaks, and always wears the mask of an oni, has led to commoners speaking of him as actually being the human-eating ogre in question. However, one day, Shishin experiences a vision of a goddess explaining to him how destroying Guwange will not only free him of Rikiou, but also restore the one he loves to him‚Äîhis lost daughter Mikoto. *Kamono Gensuke (age 15), with shikigami Kirinmaru (age 300+). Gensuke is in training as a pharmacist, and the son of an onmyouji. Kirinmaru is a bloodthirsty tengu who holds a grudge against the elder Kamono. To fulfill that grudge, Kirinmaru has possessed Gensuke. In order to channel the tengu's malice away from innocents, Gensuke has become a bounty hunter, all the while looking for a way to free himself from the curse. *Hiiragi Kosame (age 17), with shikigami Yatsuhisha (age 200+). Attacks with bow and arrows. Kosame is a miko and member of a family of demon hunters. During a conflict with demons, Kosame became possessed by Yatsuhisha, a kitsune, and has been commanded by her father to exorcise herself of him by destroying Guwange. Unusually, Yatsuhisha is perfectly willing to help Kosame in this quest. Yatsuhisha was raised by a demon with little use for malice towards humans, and has come to regard Kosame as a close friend. Even though it would mean his own death, Yatsuhisha intends to put all his effort into saving Kosame from her own death. Each player gets a unique introduction, and ending after completing the game.

It is linked to the south bank of the river by a causeway, covered for two hours either side of high tide. The island is approximately 1 mile (2 km) to the east of Maldon, Essex and 1 mile (2 km) to the west of Osea Island. The Battle of Maldon, 991 is believed to have taken place on the causeway and the south bank of the Blackwater near the island. At that time the causeway is thought to have been half as long as it is presently ‚Äì 120 yards rather than 240 yards today. Significant land reclamation was carried out by the Dutch contractor Nicholas Van Cropenrough in the early 18th century; he enwalled marshland to significantly enlarge the island but the walls were breached by the sea and the land returned to marshland on 29 November 1897. In 1923 Northey was bought by the writer and campaigner Norman Angell; in 1933 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The whole island and part of the bank near the causeway are now a national nature reserve. Northey is home to diverse birdlife and this is reflected in the place name 'Awl Creek' which perpetuates the traditional Essex dialect word for the Avocet. At one time Northey was home to more species than it is now. The island was one of the last southern strongholds of the raven, the last bird being taken from the Ladies grove in 1888. It is uninhabited apart from the warden. The island is owned by the National Trust and can be visited by arrangement with the warden. It is one of 43 (unbridged) tidal islands which can be walked to from the British mainland and one of six such tidal islands in Essex.No Boat Required ‚Äì Exploring Tidal Islands, Peter Caton, 2011, Troubador Publishing, References External links * Google Maps satellite image of Northey Island Category:Islands of Essex Category:Tidal islands of England Category:Maldon District Category:National Trust properties in Essex ","title":"Northey Island"},{"id":"2095237","text":"Old Montreal (French: Vieux-Montr√©al) is a historic neighbourhood within the municipality of Montreal in the province of Quebec, Canada. Founded by French settlers in 1642 as Fort Ville-Marie, Old Montreal is home to many structures dating back to the era of New France. The 17th century settlement lends its name to the borough in which the neighbourhood lies, Ville-Marie. Home to the Old Port of Montreal, the neighbourhood is bordered on the west by McGill Street, on the north by Ruelle des Fortifications, on the east by rue Saint- Andr√©, and on the south by the Saint Lawrence River. Following recent amendments, the neighbourhood has expanded to include the Rue des Soeurs Grises in the west, Saint Antoine Street in the north, and Saint Hubert Street in the east. In 1964, much of Old Montreal was declared a historic district by the Minist√®re des Affaires culturelles du Qu√©bec. History =Early French settlement= Depiction of the first church in Fort Ville-Marie. The settlement was established in 1642 under the authority of the Soci√©t√© Notre- Dame de Montr√©al. In 1605, Samuel de Champlain established a fur-trading post at Place Royale (Old Montreal) at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence River and the Petite Rivi√®re St-Pierre, a former river in the area. It was adjacent to present-day Place D'Youville and the Pointe-√†-Calli√®re Museum. However, the settlers were later forced to abandon the outpost due to incursions by the Iroquois. The original settlement of Montreal was founded in 1642. It was known as Ville-Marie, and was located in roughly the same location as the trading post set up by de Champlain. The founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, built a fort in 1643 which would serve as the headquarters for the Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame de Montr√©al, an organization whose mission was to convert members of First Nations to Christianity and establish a Christian settlement in New France. The company in charge of managing the settlement was founded by the Sulpician Jean-Jacques Olier and by J√©r√¥me Le Royer (Sieur de La Dauversi√®re). =French colony= A map of Montreal and its fortifications in 1725. After the Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame dissolved on March 9, 1663, the Sulpicians (who arrived in 1657) became the Seigneurs of Montreal, as King Louis XIV of France took personal control over the colony. The new system gave them the island of Montreal, with the obligation to live there and ensure its development by cultivating the land. In 1665, Louis XIV sent 1,200 men from the R√©giment de Carignan-Sali√®res. The Sulpicians organized seigneuries at the center of the island. Fran√ßois Dollier Casson established the first grid of streets in the colony, following the paths of existing trails. These early streets included the Rue Notre-Dame, the Rue Saint-Paul and Rue Saint-Jacques. Buildings of the era include the H√¥tel-Dieu de Montr√©al, the Saint-Sulpice Old Seminary and Notre Dame Church (replaced later by the Notre-Dame Basilica). In the early 18th century, the name \\"Montreal\\" (which originally referred to the mountain Mont-Royal) gradually replaced that of Ville-Marie. The arrival in 1657 of Marguerite Bourgeoys (who founded the Congregation Notre-Dame) and the arrival of the Jesuits and Recollets in 1692, helped to ensure the Catholic character of the settlement. The original fortifications of Montreal, erected in 1717 by Gaspard Chaussegros de L√©ry, formed the boundaries of Montreal at the time. De L√©ry had the fortifications constructed to secure the settlement from a British invasion and to allow future expansion inside the walls. Though the walls may have provided security from invasion, they created a different problem: a large concentration of wooden houses (with fireplaces) led to many devastating fires. In 1721, Montreal received a royal order from France to ban wood construction; buildings were to be constructed using stone, but the ban was never fully respected. =British control= capitulation of Montreal during the Seven Years' War. Montreal and the rest of New France became a British colony following the war. Canada (New France) became a British colony in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. British rule radically changed the face of Old Montreal, partially due to significant fires that destroyed much of the city and provided the British with a mandate to rebuild it. In May 1765, fire destroyed about 110 houses before destroying the old H√¥tel de Calli√®re and the former General Hospital. In April 1768, 88 houses between rue Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Hotel Vaudreuil were burned, including the Congregation Notre-Dame convent. Between the two fires, nearly half of the buildings in the city were destroyed. In the following years, the city was rebuilt even more densely. On June 6, 1803, a massive fire destroyed the prison, the church and the dependencies of Jesuits, a dozen houses and the Ch√¢teau Vaudreuil. Two speculators bought the Ch√¢teau's gardens, offered one- third to the city, and divided the rest into seven lots of their own. The city's oldest public monument, Nelson's Column, was erected in 1809 on part of the former garden plot and given to the city. This space became the new market square, called March√© Neuf (New Market) before assuming its present name of Place Jacques-Cartier in 1845. The space occupied by the church of the Jesuits became the Place Vauquelin and Montreal City Hall arose from the old Jesuit gardens in 1873. In 1812, a fire destroyed the luxurious Mansion House hotel, which had been popular with the Beaver Club and had housed the first public library in Montreal. It was replaced by the British-American Hotel, which contained the John Molson-built Royal Theatre, the city's first permanent theatre. The hotel burned in 1833, and was rebuilt in 1845 at the Bonsecours Market. In 1849, a riot caused a fire with political consequences when, protesting against a law, a Tory crowd burned down the Parliament building in the old March√© Saint-Anne on Place d'Youville. The site of the Parliament fire housed Montreal's first fire station in 1903; the building still exists as the Centre d‚Äôhistoire de Montr√©al. Colonial authorities decided upon the first radical transformation of the area in 1804, with the destruction of the fortifications surrounding the heart of Montreal. Completed in 1815, this enlarged the perimeter of Old Montreal and improved access to suburban communities. The 19th century witnessed the emergence of a bourgeoisie of mostly Scottish merchants. The growing activity of the port changed the urban landscape. Old Montreal became less residential, as the rich Scottish and English merchants built extravagant homes closer to Mount Royal (in what would become the Golden Square Mile). Anglophone influence became the dominating force in the areas of banking, manufacturing, commerce, and finance. St. James Street became the financial centre of Montreal, with large banks such as the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada, insurance companies and the stock exchange. Notre-Dame Basilica is a Catholic church completed in 1829. Rue Saint Amable Most of the financial buildings on St. James Street were designed by anglophone architects. The same is true for institutional buildings such as the Old Court House and the Customs House designed by John Ostell, the Bonsecours Market and even the Notre-Dame Basillica (whose fa√ßade is the work of an Irish Protestant from New York, James O'Donnell). The only notable exception is the Montreal City Hall, which was inspired by the Hotel de Ville de Rennes. The character of the Victorian style of the late-19th- century buildings was a significant change from the stone masonry used during the French era and affected the appearance of Old Montreal. =Decline, preservation, and renewal= The district continued to grow during the early 20th century, evidenced by construction of prestigious buildings such as the Aldred Building (1929‚Äì1931), La Sauvegarde Building (1913), and the first Stock Exchange (1903‚Äì1904). Port activities, the financial sector, and the municipal government helped to maintain activity until the Great Depression began in 1929. During the Depression, the relocation of port facilities further east deprived Old Montreal of many companies related to the maritime trade, leaving many abandoned warehouses and commercial buildings. The downtown-area relocation several blocks to the north, and the near-complete absence of residents, (there were only a few hundred in 1950), had the effect of emptying the district when businesses closed at the end of the day. At that time, the lack of nightlife gave the district a reputation for being dangerous at night. Old Montreal increasingly found itself changing to accommodate the rise of the automobile. Several prestigious locations, such as the Place d'Armes, the Place d'Youville, and Place Jacques-Cartier, were snarled with traffic in the mid-20th century. For municipal authorities, unaware of its potential heritage value, Old Montreal was an anomaly. City planners considered wider streets, which would have meant razing many older buildings. A proposed elevated highway along the river over the rue de la Commune spurred a movement to preserve the district. Dutch-born architect and urban planner Daniel van Ginkel played a major role in saving the district from destruction during the early 1960s. As assistant director of the City of Montreal's newly formed planning department, he persuaded authorities to abandon plans for an expressway that would have cut through the old city. In 1964, most of Old Montreal was classified as a historic district; despite this, the Quebec government razed several 19th-century buildings to build a new courthouse. In the early 21st century, the City of Montreal began a revitalization effort of several areas in Old Montreal, including Place Jacques-Cartier. In addition to the return of a residential base, the area has become attractive to the hotel industry. While in the 19th century all major hotels were in Old Montreal, by 1980 there were none. In 2009, there were about 20 hotels, mostly in restored older buildings. A steady stream of tourists and the presence of new residents encourage nightlife and entertainment. In addition, municipal authorities have invested large sums to renew the area's infrastructure. The Place Jacques- Cartier and part of the Place d'Youville have been redesigned, and a restoration of the Place d'Armes is in progress. A lighting plan was also developed to highlight the different fa√ßade styles. There is now a consensus that the historical legacy of Old Montreal is its major asset. Aided by redevelopment, it is now the leading tourist destination in Montreal. Architecture and urban planning Old Montreal is a major tourist attraction. With some of its buildings dating to the 17th century, it is one of the oldest urban areas in North America. In the eastern part of the old city (near Place Jacques-Cartier) the following notable buildings can be found: Montreal City Hall, Bonsecours Market and Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, as well as preserved colonial mansions, such as the Ch√¢teau Ramezay and the Sir George-√âtienne Cartier National Historic Site of Canada. Further west, Place d'Armes is dominated by Notre-Dame Basilica] on its southern side, accompanied by the Saint-Sulpice Seminary (the oldest extant building in Montreal). The other sides of the square are devoted to commerce; to the north is the former Bank of Montreal Head Office and to the west, the Aldred Building and the 1888 New York Life Building, the oldest skyscraper in Canada. The rest of Saint Jacques Street is lined with old bank buildings (like the Old Royal Bank Building) from its heyday as Canada's financial centre. Bonsecours Market is located in the eastern portion of Old Montreal. The southwest of the old city contains important archeological remains of Montreal's first settlement (around Place d'Youville and Place Royale) in the Pointe-√†-Calli√®re museum. Architecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored to keep the look of the city in its earliest days as a settlement, and horse-drawn cal√®ches help maintain that image. The old town's riverbank is taken up by the Old Port (Vieux-Port), whose maritime facilities are surrounded with recreational space and a variety of museums and attractions. The Iberville terminal on the Alexandra Pier serves as the cruise terminal for about 50,000 passengers annually from large cruise ships plying the St Lawrence Seaway. =Champ de Mars= Champ de Mars is a large public space located between Montreal City Hall and the Ville-Marie Expressway. It offers a view of downtown Montreal and Chinatown. It is notable due to its location and its archaeological remains. The two parallel lines of stone are one of the few spots in present-day Montreal where you can still see physical evidence of the fortified settlement from colonial times. Transportation Old Montreal is accessible from downtown via the Underground City and is served by several STM bus routes and the Champ-de-Mars, Place-d'Armes, and Square-Victoria-OACI Metro stations. Ferries to the south shore city of Longueuil are available during the summer, as are a network of bicycle paths.

Its heartland is Spain.Ulrika Martensson, Jennifer Bailey, Priscilla Ringrose, Asbjorn Dyrendal, Fundamentalism in the Modern World Vol 2:Fundamentalism and Communication: Culture, Media and the Public Sphere, ed. I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 113 The number of its followers may amount, according to one estimate, to around 10,000.Oscar Perez Ventura, Movimientos Islamistas en Espana: el Movimiento Munidal Murabitun, conversos al Islam en Al-Andalus, Instituto Espanol de Estudios Estrategos, 2012, p. 8 The movement's objectives include the restoration of Zakat, Da‚Äôwa and the practice of bayat (allegiance) to an Emir. It considers itself a tariqa in the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa tradition. Background The name Murabitun derives from the name of the Almoravid dynasty. The founder of the Murabitun World Movement is Abdalqadir as-Sufi, a convert to Islam born Ian Dallas in Ayr, Scotland, in 1930. He met his first Shaykh, Muhammad ibn al-Habib, in Meknes around 1968, and was made a muqaddam and given the title \\"as-Sufi\\". Ibn al-Habib said to him, ‚ÄúYou can stay here with me, and something might happen. But go to England and see what will happen,‚ÄùFrom ‚ÄúThe new Murabitun‚Äù by Umar Ibrahim Vadillo, Yildiz Productions, 1999 and so he went to London and gathered a group of new British Muslims, returning to Morocco in 1970. He founded a learning centre in Bristol Gardens, London, in 1972, and another centre in Berkeley, California. Abdalqadir as-Sufi travelled in Europe and America, held talks, and published works such as The Way of MuhammadThe Way of Muhammad and Islam Journal proposing that Islam could be understood, and entered, as the \\"completion of the Western intellectual and spiritual tradition\\". He also initiated translations into English of classical texts on Islamic law and Sufism, including the Muwatta Imam MalikThe Muwatta of Imam Malik and the letters of Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi, published as The Darqawi Way. In 1982 Abdalqadir as-Sufi held a series of talks in America which were to become the basis of his work, Root Islamic Education.Root Islamic Education Ideas =Position on zakat= The political and social work of the Murabitun centres around the restoration of the ‚Äúfallen pillar‚ÄùBewley, Abdalhaqq, Zakat: raising a fallen pillar, Black Stone Press, UK, 2001 of zakat, which, it is claimed, has been abandoned on several primary counts. Principally: # that it must be taken by an emirFor example: \\"The zakat is fard and one of the fundamental matters of Islam, such that whoever denies that it is obligatory is a kafir.\\" And \\"It is obligatory to pay zakat to the amir (Imam) if he is just. If he is not just and it is impossible to divert it from him, then one pays it to him and that discharges one's duty, but if it is possible to divert it from him then the person paying it should pay it to those who can validly receive it but it is recommended that one not undertake to pay it directly oneself for fear of praise.\\" Al-Qawanin al-Fiqhiyya, Ibn Juzayy al-Kalbi # that if it consists of money it must be taken in gold and/or silverFor example: Al-Fath al-‚ÄòAliyy al- Malik fi al-Fatawi ‚Äòala Madhhab Malik, Shaykh Muhammad ‚ÄòIllish, Al-Azhar # that it must be disbursed immediately. As their authority for this position the Murabitun cite a wide range of sources, beginning with the Qur'anic injunction to take zakat,‚ÄúTake zakat from their wealth‚Äù Surat Tawba 9:103 the Prophetic practice of zakat-taking, the well-known position of the Khalif Abu Bakr as-Siddiq,\\"Fight them if they retain only a hobbling-rope of what was collected before.\\" Al-Bukhari in his Sahih in the Book of Zakat, in the chapter on the obligatory nature of zakat. and the established practice among the world Muslim community which was until relatively recently the assessment and collection of zakat by the Leader and his collectors. This they place in contradistinction to the currently prevailing practices of voluntary self- assessment, donation to the zakat charity of one‚Äôs choice, and the placement of zakat donations into interim or even long-term investment funds. This, they argue, destroys the political cohesion of the Muslim community, which is based primarily on the circulation of wealth along divinely revealed lines.Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi, Sultaniyya, Madinah Press 2001 They also condemn zakat investment funds as un-Islamic. =Shari‚Äòah currency= They previously connected their position on zakat with promotion of the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham, which was developed above all by the scholar Umar Ibrahim Vadillo. Paper money, since actually a promise of payment written on paper, can from the point of view of zakat only be considered in terms of its value as paper, since zakat cannot be discharged by passing on a token of debt owed to a third party. Vadillo has written extensivelyA fatwa on banking in Islam by Umar Ibrahim Vadillo is available here, Fatwa on Banking on the origins of paper money and the Islamic position on money. The Murabitun traced the bi- metallic currency back to Muhammad and the first Muslim community; its specific weights and purities were formally recorded by ‚ÄòUmar Ibn al- Khattab.At-Taratib al-Idariyya, Shaykh al-KattaaniAbu Bakr ibn Abi Maryam reported that he heard the Muhammed say: \\"A time is certainly coming over mankind in which there will be nothing [left] which will be of use save a dinar and a dirham.\\" (The Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) They also cited the dinar‚Äôs mention in the Qur'an,‚ÄúBut there are others among them who, if you entrust them with just a single dinar, will not return it to you.‚Äù Surat Al‚ÄòImran 3:74 its use in the universally accepted fiqh to define the terms of zakat, and its mention as currency throughout the entire body of Islamic fiqh. In February 2014, however, Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, \\"So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham\\".\\"THE ISLAMIC DINAR ‚Äì A WAY-STAGE PASSED\\" Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi =Emirate, sultaniyya and caliphate= The Murabitun advocate personal rule as the Islamic and indeed natural form of human governance,Sultaniyya is a modern statement on leadership in Islam. Abdalqadir surveys Islam under the chapter headings Deen, Dawla (polity), Waqf, Trade, the Sultan ‚Äî personal rule ‚Äî and Tasawwuf.

The Murabitun do not, however, in any way dispute the validity of the other legal schools,Discourse on the Four Madh'habs by Abdalhaqq Bewley nor is adherence to or advocacy of the madhhab of Malik a condition of membership of the Murabitun. =Islamic trading and social welfare= The Murabitun advocate a revival of the forms of trading and social welfare practiced during the first generations of Muslims and for most of the history of Islam, proposing that these are the natural modes of human activity and rejecting the dialectical categorisation of ‚Äúancient‚Äù or ‚Äúmodern‚Äù, a set of opposites whose application to Islam they consider irrelevant and misleading.Ian Dallas, The Time of the Bedouin, Budgate Press 2006 These models have been formulated in detail and include awqaf for the funding of social welfare institutions, mosques and other public facilities. =Position against terrorism= Abdalqadir as-Sufi has consistently identified terrorism and suicide tactics as forbidden in and alien to Islam, and indeed as a phenomenon with no precursor in Muslim history. Instead, he states that its original appearance as a tactic and a psychology was among the Isma‚Äòili sect of Shi‚Äòa Islam, and that it later emerged among the Russian nihilists of the late 19th century.Fatwa on Suicide as a Tactic, Madinah Press 2004. Organizational form The Jumua Mosque of Cape Town, established by Abdalqadir as-Sufi and members of the Murabitun The Murabitun organise themselves around emirs.

The main island is Cayo del Centro, with an area of , which is scantily covered with grass. Bushes and several clumps of palms are also present. A pair of lighted range beacons stand on the cay. Cayo del Este, a cay large and high, lies on a detached reef lying southeast of Cayo del Centro. Cayo del Oeste, a cay in area and high, lies on a small detached reef about west of the south end of Cayo del Centro.(areas) The chain is uninhabited, and lacks structures except for the beacons on Cayo del Centro. Vegetation on the islands is sparse, consisting of sand shrubs and grasses. It currently serves as a navigational marker. Cayos Arcas Terminal, an extensive chain of petroleum stations on the Arcas' reef system is located to the south of the islands. The Arcas oil rigs are currently among the largest oil producers in the gulf in terms of output. The Arcas chain was often used for military operations in the Gulf during the 19th century. A naval flotilla from the Republic of Texas briefly occupied the island during action in the Republic of Yucat√°n rebellion. During the American Civil War the famous Confederate raider CSS Alabama used the remote chain as a rendezvous point to be resupplied while conducting operations in the gulf. Geography Cayo del Centro, the largest of the three islands, is in total, with about of permanently unsubmerged land. On the island, viewed through Google Maps, along with a covering of Palythoa caribaeorum, Zoanthus sociatus, Acropora palmata, Montastraea annularis, and Diploria strigosa, appear to be a few small buildings and small signs of past human habitation. The island has at least 6 sandy Tidal islands, none of which seem to exceed or have any vegetation on them. Cayo del Este is to the east of Cayo del Centro. This island appears to have 2 species of plant on it, and a single nearby islet about long and wide. To the west, the island has a fairly long spit of sand leading to a sort of tidal lagoon. Cayo del Oeste, the smallest the main islands, is further from the other two, and is mainly a triangular islet connected to a spit of sand, with a very small amount of vegetation at the center. The island, although having no nearby islets/sandbars, does have a shallow strip of coast going southwest from its eastern edge. About ‚Öì of the way between Cayo del Centro and Cayo del Oeste is a shoal and small island long and only wide. The island, although small, has a fairly large surrounding shallows, which nearby boats should be wary of. Further to the north of this island is another shallow reef that, although not breaking the surface, is about wide and less than deep. Some of the group, most notably a cay on the North/Northeast part of the shoal, is surrounded by a very shallow, dangerous reef. The only safe entrances by boat to the islands are to the North-West-West, South-South-West, and West for the central, east, and west islands respectively. The islands are likely formed by coral growth around an extinct volcano caldera.

The onset of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 diminished the electorate's confidence in the government, and Chavalit was forced to resign. Discredited as a result of the economic crisis, Chavalit formed a coalition with the populist Thai Rak Thai Party led by Thaksin Shinawatra to take part in the 2001 elections. Shortly after the election, the majority of the New Aspiration Party merged with Thai Rak Thai and Chavalit became the Deputy Prime Minister in Thaksin's cabinet. After the election in 2001, Thaksin Shinawatra of the Thai Rak Thai Party became prime minister. The New Aspiration Party joined his government. In the following year, the party's majority‚Äîincluding leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh‚Äîmerged into the Thai Rak Thai Party. Some members disagreed with this decision: Thita Rangsitpol Manitkul joined the Democrat Party instead, Chalerm Yubamrung revived his Mass Party, and Chingchai Mongkoltham decided to continue the New Aspiration Party. In the legislative elections on July 3, 2011, the party won 0.08% of the popular vote and no seats in the House of Representatives.

Born as Richard Henry McFarlane, he attended Thornleigh Salesian College, Bolton and went on to graduate from Bradford University. He went on to have a variety of jobs and travelled widely, from labouring on German railways to teaching English in Cairo and India. The choice of stage persona \\"Hovis Presley\\" was in itself a deft example of aspects of his work--ironic word-play, incongruously blending the expected norms of poetry with slightly surreal evocations of ordinary, and distinctively Northern English life. Presley began writing poems and sketches as a teenager but only ventured out onto the North West comedy circuit at the age of 29. His poem, \\"I Rely On You\\" (included in his 1993 anthology, Poetic Off Licence), was used by many couples in wedding ceremonies.Hovis Presley: Bittersweet poet and stand-up comedian Presley often performed his poems in a live environment, running an \\"alternative to alternative comedy clubs\\" and frequently appearing on radio with John Shuttleworth and Mark Radcliffe among others. He also appeared on the BBC Three show Whine Gums, which presented many modern poets reading their work. His 1997 Edinburgh Festival Fringe show (entitled \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat, That's My Hat\\") was described as \\"an hour of great material, lovingly performed\\" and sold out. Presley, however, was terrified by this level of success and vanished. The shows were pulled and he was eventually found by police. After this he concentrated on smaller-scale events, outside the comedy mainstream, often working for charity. He also taught comedy to drama students at the University of Salford, having previously taught English as a second language and general studies. He regularly helped out his students by finding them slots at local comedy nights. He died in June 2005 after a heart attack brought on by a viral infection. A tribute night was held in his home town of Bolton on 21 November 2005. The show was held in the Albert Halls, Bolton and was attended by Johnny Vegas, Badly Drawn Boy, Graham Fellows, Mark Radcliffe, Justin Moorhouse, Bernard Wrigley, Archie Kelly, Susan Vale, Phil Cool, Bob Williamson and Thick Richard.Stars in tribute to Hovis References External links * Official Hovis Presley site * Marissa Burgess Hovis Presley (Guardian obituary) 29 June 2005 * Toby Hadoke Hovis Presley (Independent obituary) 13 June 2005 * Hovis Presley Myspace Memoriam * Hovis Has Left The Building (BBC Radio 4 programme) Category:People from Bolton Category:1960 births Category:2005 deaths Category:English male comedians Category:Academics of the University of Salford Category:Alumni of the University of Bradford Category:English male poets Category:20th-century English poets Category:20th-century British male writers Category:20th-century British comedians ","title":"Hovis Presley"},{"id":"2095277","text":"Severn Cullis-Suzuki (born 30 November 1979) is a Canadian environmental activist, speaker, television host, and author.

Early life and career Stringer was born in Whitehorse, Yukon in 1903.\\"Alex Stringer\\" [obituary], Winnipeg Free Press, 15 February 1969. His father was the Reverend Isaac O. Stringer, a prominent member of the Anglican Church of Canada. Originally from King's County, Ireland, the elder Stringer later became Archbishop of Yukon.Winnipeg Free Press, 15 February 1969, p. 9. Stringer received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto, and later a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba (1933). He was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1937, and became a barrister at law with the firm of Law, Thorvaldson & Co. He served overseas with the Canadian Navy in World War II, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. Public life In January 1946, Manitoba held special elections for residents who were unable to cast ballots in the 1945 provincial election by virtue of having served overseas in World War II. Stringer was elected as the Navy representative, running as an independent supporter of Manitoba's coalition government (which included Liberal-Progressives, Progressive Conservatives and Social Credit members).Arthur Yates, Red Tide Stemmed, (Victoria: Trafford Publishing), 2001, p. 54. After the election, he sat with the Progressive Conservative caucus in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. He ran for re- election in the 1949 provincial election as a Progressive Conservative, and finished last in a field of seven candidates in the four-member constituency of Winnipeg South. Stringer continued his legal practice until November 1, 1959, when he was appointed as Senior Judge of Juvenile and Family Court. He became known for his work in youth criminal justice reform, calling for more humane facilities for young offenders and for the separation of juveniles from adult criminals in provincial jails.

Retrieved 12 September 2011. Farbissina is a German attack and defence specialist and the founder of \\"the militant wing of the Salvation Army\\". She is also Dr. Evil's henchwoman and tries to help in his schemes to terrorize and take over the world. She has a heavy German accent and is well known for a running gag in which she shouts her orders needlessly loud and screeching, often startling Dr. Evil. For her performances, Sterling was nominated for Favorite Supporting Actress in a Comedy at the BMI Film & TV Awards. Biography =Characterization= Frau's look and demeanour are parodies of several female villains from early James Bond films, namely From Russia with Love's Rosa Klebb (played by Lotte Lenya), On Her Majesty's Secret Services Irma Bunt (played by Ilse Steppat), and particularly the character of Frau Hoffner (played by Anna Quayle) in the 1967 Bond spoof Casino Royale. In Mike Myers' book Canada, he states that Frau was a mixture of Rosa Klebb and Lotta Hitschmanova, who appeared in commercials for the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada on late-night television. Myers, Mike (2016). Canada, p. 230. Doubleday Canada. Farbissina asserts that she would eventually like to get out of the criminal mastermind business and open a boarding school for girls. This is another reference to Quayle's \\"Frau Hoffner\\" role in Casino Royale in which Hoffner heads an international spy school in East Berlin known as the \\"Mata Hari School of Dancing\\", where she boards and trains young women to be agents for both sides of the Cold War. Surname Her surname derives from the Yiddish word ( in German), meaning \\"embittered\\"; a is an angry, bitter, vocal (male) person, while is the corresponding female form. =Background= She has a heavy German accent; in the German dubbed versions of the films, she speaks with an Upper Saxon dialect, suggesting coming from East Germany. In Comedy Central's Canned Ham: The Doctor Evil Story, a half-hour-long preview special of The Spy Who Shagged Me, Dr. Evil states that he met Farbissina \\"at gymnasia in Baden- Baden at a street corner next to the McDonald's.\\" Out of all his henchmen and assistants, Farbissina is perhaps closest to Dr. Evil. In praising Dr. Evil, Farbissina commented, \\"Dr. Evil is a man of great intelligence - able to step on a bug and say 'too bad!'\\" =International Man of Mystery= Frau participates in helping Dr. Evil hijack a nuclear warhead and hold the world hostage. It is revealed that Frau used a sample of Evil's semen just a couple of years after Dr. Evil's cryostasis to artificially create his son, Scott Evil (played by Seth Green), now a Generation Y young adult. Scott is resentful of his father, but close to Frau, the only one who cares about his wellbeing. In the first film, Dr. Evil is about to press a button that would kill Scott for his insolence by burning him alive, but Frau swats his hand away, then winks at Scott. =The Spy Who Shagged Me= The second film jumps from the 1990s to the 1960s due to time travel. Inexplicably, Frau Farbissina looks exactly the same in the 1960s as she did in the 1990s, which was used for comedic effect in the film. In the present, she states that she is homosexual and is in a relationship with Una Brau, a woman she met on a LPGA tour. However, when Dr. Evil goes back in time, after imbibing some of Austin Powers' mojo, he has sex with Frau. This leads to an uncomfortable morning- after encounter and Farbissina swearing she will never love another man. In the closing credits, Farbissina and Scott Evil go on The Jerry Springer Show, in which she reveals herself to be Scott's mother. She also reveals she never told him because she didn't want him to be hurt; he forgives her and they embrace. =Goldmember= Frau is still helping Dr. Evil with his evil schemes. Frau and Dr. Evil also kiss while he is in prison; although the two enjoy it (despite her having been established as a lesbian in the previous movie), the purpose was to transfer a key to Dr. Evil so that he could escape. Once her son Scott begins to become evil, she shows that she is very proud.

Biography Eifler was born in Los Angeles, California to Carl Eifler Sr. and his wife Pauline. His parents were both born in Wisconsin to German-American immigrants, and his father was a \\"rig builder\\" in a buggy shop.1910 U.S. Census, Los Angeles, California, enumeration district 214, sheet 15 He served in the Los Angeles Police Department, followed by the United States Border Patrol. Eifler enlisted in the Army(age 15) and spent a year as a Pvt in Panama before being returned to the US as underage. He served in the United States Army Reserve in the 1930s, earning a commission, and he was called to active duty in early 1941. He was officer-of-the-day for Sand Island Internment Camp in Hawaii on December 7, 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, during which Japanese aircraft made several strafing runs on the jeep he was driving. Shortly afterwards, Eifler was ordered to report to \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan, commander of the Coordinator of Information, which would soon become the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Eifler was selected to command Detachment 101, a paramilitary organization intended to operate against the Japanese army in the Burma Campaign, in China India Burma Theater. Eifler performed his work with distinction, surviving two plane crashes, but finally being disabled by head injuries that required 18 months of hospitalization. He held the rank of colonel when he was relieved of command in 1943 because of his injuries. Eifler turned over command of Detachment 101 to Lt. Col. William R. Peers, and was flown to Hawaii to recover. In 1945, the OSS had Eifler devise a plan to parachute into Nazi Germany disguised as a German general to kidnap Werner Heisenberg, Germany's top nuclear physicist, smuggle Heisenberg to Switzerland, and bring him to the United States. Eifler did not end up doing the mission, as he was told the Americans had already developed the Atom Bomb. The sole reason for kidnapping Heisenberg was to prevent the Germans from developing the bomb before the Americans. In reality, the mission was still alive, though it was handed to Moe Berg. After the war, Eifler earned a doctorate of psychology from the Illinois Institute of Technology and worked as a clinical psychologist in Monterey, California. He died in 2002 at the age of 95 in Salinas, California. Eifler (a burly 6'2\\") had outlived both of his wives as well as his son, Carl Henry Eifler.

Dutton Survey After the Hayden Survey was absorbed into the U.S. Geological Survey in 1879, Holmes went to Munich, Germany, to further his art studies under Frank Duveneck and to take lessons in \\"museum making\\" from Adolphe B. Meyer of Dresden's Anthropology Museum. On Holmes's return to the U.S., he was hired by the Geological Survey and assigned to Clarence Dutton as a geologist and illustrator. Holmes illustrated the atlas for Dutton's Tertiary History of the Grand Canyon District (1882); his triptych panorama of the Grand Canyon from Point Sublime is a masterpiece of American scientific illustration. He was also a noted mountain climber, and a peak in Yellowstone National Park ‚Äî Mount Holmes ‚Äî was named in his honor. In 1875, Holmes began studying the remains of the Ancestral Pueblo culture in the San Juan River region of Utah. His models of ancient Indian ruins were a sensation at the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia. Holmes became particularly interested in prehistoric pottery and shell art, producing the published works of \\"Art in Shell of the American Indians (1883)\\" and \\"Pottery of the Ancient Pueblos (1886)\\". He expanded these studies to include textiles, and he became well known as an expert in both ancient and existing arts produced by Native Americans of the Southwest. In 1889 he discovered and reported Indian petroglyphs in central West Virginia. =Smithsonian Institution= Holmes left the Geological Survey in 1889 to become an archaeologist with the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology. He left Washington temporarily, from 1894 to 1897, to serve as curator of anthropology at the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, during which time he led an expedition to Mexico. He returned to the Smithsonian in 1897 to serve as head curator of anthropology at the U.S. National Museum. From 1902 to 1909 he served as Chief (i.e. director) of the Bureau of American Ethnology, succeeding John Wesley Powell. During this period he studied the Etowah Indian Mounds of the Mississippian culture in Georgia, and in 1903, he published his Synthesis of Pottery. In 1905, Holmes was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1910, he became chairman of the Division of Anthropology of the U.S. National Museum. In 1920, Holmes became the director of National Gallery of Art (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), where he assembled exhibits of Indian arts from the Northwest Coast. He published many works on arch√¶ological and anthropological subjects. He edited geological publications, including Hayden's Atlas of Colorado and the eleventh and twelfth reports of the Geological Survey. His books include: \\"Handbook of Aboriginal American Antiquities\\" (1919). =Later years= Holmes lived with his son in Royal Oak, Michigan, upon his retirement in 1932 from the position of Director of the National Gallery of Art.John R.

As a teacher, his pupils included Susan Brown Chase. =Legacy= Of Holmes's many contributions and accomplishments, he is probably best known for the role he played in the controversy over the antiquity of humans in the Americas. Holmes insisted that claims for the early presence of humans should be subjected to the most rigorous testing. His position on this matter had a healthy and conservative influence on what is one of the most fundamental questions in American archaeology. There are two mountain summits named in his honor: Mount Holmes in Yellowstone National Park, and Mount Holmes in the Henry Mountains of Utah.

Summary Norna-Gest was the son of a Danish man named Thord Thingbiter, who once dwelt on the estate of Gr√∏ning in Denmark. When he was born, three Norns arrived and foretold the child's destiny. Two of them gave him good gifts. However Skuld, the youngest of the Norns, deeming that the two others made rather light of her, determined to render void their promises of good fortune for the child. So she prophesied that his life was to last no longer than that of a candle standing lit beside the cradle. The eldest Norn (Ur√∞r) instantly extinguished the flame and asked his mother to hide it well. When Norna-Gest had grown up he became the care- taker of the candle and he is said to have lived for 300 years. He took part in the battles of Sigurd the V√∂lsung, spent time with Ragnar Lodbrok's son Bj√∂rn Ironside and his brothers, with Starkad, with the Swedish king Sigurd Hring, with King Erik at Uppsala, with King Harald Fairhair and with King Hlodver in Germany. According to legend, when King Olaf Tryggvason tried to convert the Norse to Christianity, he brought Norna-Gest to his court. In the third year of the reign of King Olaf, Norna-Gest came into the presence of the king and asked to be admitted to his bodyguard. He was uncommonly tall and strong and somewhat stricken in years. Norna-Gest afterward permitted himself to be baptized at the king's desire and lit the candle that the norn Skuld had prophesied about. In accordance with the prophecy, when the candle failed, Norna-Gest died. Sources The story of Norna-Gest is narrated in Nornagests √æ√°ttr, which was written about the year 1300. The story was later incorporated as an episode of the Saga of √ìl√°fr Tryggvason in the medieval Icelandic manuscript Flateyjarb√≥k which contains several poems from the Poetic Edda. Norse Mythology: Legends of Gods and Heroes (Peter A. Munch. New York: The American-Scandinavian Foundation. 1926) Other references The story of Nornagest and his candle has a counterpart in Greek mythology: the story of Meleager, who was prophesied to live only as long as a certain log was unburnt. The story is included in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Science fiction writer Poul Anderson incorporated the story of Nornagest in The Boat of a Million Years, a collection of short stories about immortals.

In the late 1950s, he invented the method of \\"wordless functional analysis\\", in which a musical composition is analysed in musical sound alone, without any words being heard or read. He worked full- time for the BBC between 1959 and 1979.  Life and career  Keller was born into a wealthy and culturally well-connected Jewish family in Vienna,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: \\"he described himself as an 'unpious Jew'\\" and, as a boy, was taught by the same Oskar Adler who had, decades earlier, been Arnold Schoenberg's boyhood friend and first teacher. He also came to know the composer and performer Franz Schmidt, but was never a formal pupil. In 1938, the Anschluss forced Keller to flee to London (where he had relatives), and, in the years that followed, he became a prominent and influential figure in the UK's musical and music-critical life. Initially active as a violinist and violist, he soon found his niche as a highly prolific and provocative writer on music, as well as an influential teacher, lecturer, broadcaster and coach. An original thinker never afraid of controversy, Keller's passionate support of composers whose work he saw as under-valued or insufficiently understood made him a tireless advocate of Benjamin Britten and Arnold Schoenberg, as well as an illuminating analyst of figures such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven and Mendelssohn. Many of Keller's earliest articles appeared in the journals Music Review and Music Survey, the latter of which was co-edited by him after he joined the founding editor Donald Mitchell for the so-called 'New Series' (1949‚Äì52). In later years, much of his advocacy was carried out from within the BBC, where he came to hold several senior positions and was a regular contributor to The Listener magazine. It was also from within the BBC that Keller (in collaboration with Susan Bradshaw) perpetrated in 1961 the \\"Piotr Zak\\" hoax, broadcasting a deliberately nonsensical series of random noises, as a new modernist piece by a fictitious Polish composer. The hoax was designed to demonstrate the poor quality of critical discourse surrounding contemporary music at a problematic stage in its historical development; in this aspect, the hoax was a failure, as no critic expressed any particular enthusiasm for Piotr Zak's piece, with all published reviews being roundly dismissive of the work. In 1967, Keller had an famous encounter with the rock group Pink Floyd (then called \\"The Pink Floyd\\") on the TV show The Look of the Week. Keller was generally puzzled by, or even contemptuous of, the group and its music, repeatedly returning to the criticism that they were too loud for his taste. He ended his interview segment with the band by saying: \\"My verdict is that it is a little bit of a regression to childhood ‚Äì but, after all, why not?\\" Keller's gift for systematic thinking, allied to his philosophical and psycho-analytic knowledge, bore fruit in the method of \\"wordless functional analysis\\" (abbreviated by the football-loving Keller as \\"FA\\"), designed to furnish incontrovertibly audible demonstrations of a masterwork's \\"all-embracing background unity\\". This method was developed in tandem with a \\"Theory of Music\\" that explicitly considered musical structure from the point of view of listener expectations; the \\"meaningful contradiction\\" of expected \\"background\\" by unexpectable \\"foreground\\" was seen as generating a work's expressive content. An element of Keller's theory of unity was the \\"Principle of Reversed and Postponed Antecedents and Consequents\\", which has not been widely adopted. His term \\"homotonality\\", however, has proved useful to musicologists in several fields. Keller was married to the artist Milein Cosman, whose drawings illustrated some of his work. As a man prominent in the world of 'contemporary music' (even working for several years as the BBC's \\"Chief Assistant, New Music\\"), Keller had close personal and professional ties with many composers and was frequently the dedicatee of new compositions. Those who dedicated works to him include: * Judith Bingham: \\"Pictured Within\\", for piano solo (1981) * Benjamin Britten: String Quartet No.3, Op. 94 * Benjamin Frankel: String Quartet No.5, Op.43 * Philip Grange: \\"In Memoriam HK\\", for solo trombone (c.1990) * David Matthews: Piano Trio No.1; 'To Hans Keller' * Robert Matthew-Walker: Piano Sonata No.3 ‚Äì \\"Fantasy-Sonata: Hamlet\\", Op.34 (1980) * Bayan Northcott * Buxton Orr: Piano Trio No.1; 'In admiration and friendship' * Robert Simpson: Symphony No.7; \\"To Hans and Milein Keller\\" * Josef Tal: Double Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra; \\"To Hans and Milein Keller\\". In December 1979, Keller received the \\"Special Award\\" of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain. In September 1985, just weeks before his death from motor neurone disease, he received from the President of Austria the Ehrenkreuz f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kunst, 1 Klasse (\\"Cross of Honour for Arts and Sciences, 1st Class\\"). His manuscripts (radio broadcasts and musicological writings) are kept at the Cambridge University Library.

History The party was founded on 17 August 1971 by Walter Lini as the New Hebridean Cultural Association, renamed later that same year as the New Hebrides National Party, and was one of two parties formed during the country's move towards independence. While the NHNP was supported by British interests, the Union of New Hebrides Communities was supported by French interests. The NHNP went on to win the 1975 elections and in 1977 it was renamed the Vanua'aku Pati. The party won the pre-independence 1979 elections and Lini became chief minister. The country gained independence in 1980 and Lini became the first Prime Minister of Vanuatu, remaining in the post until 1991. In 1991 the party split, and Lini was among those who left the party. After the 1991 elections, the party lost its dominance over the government. Despite this, the party remained strong. During the next decade, as party members Donald Kalpokas and Edward Natapei served as prime ministers of Vanuatu. The party began steadily losing seats in the early 2000s; it took 18 in the 1998 elections, 14 in the 2002 elections, and 8 in the 2004 elections, a setback which forced Prime Minister Natapei to resign. The party suffered another split after the elections, as the leadership refused to support the national coalition government of Serge Vohor while two Vanua'aku Party representatives supported this government, allowing it to take office. However, after a controversy over the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and China, the Vanua'aku Party reunited in December 2004 and was involved in the effort to oust Vohor. It remained influential, and was a key supporter of the National United Party government of Walter Lini's brother Ham Lini which lasted from December 2004 through the September 2008 elections. After a short break from participation in the coalition government, the party returned in July 2007 when its leader, former Prime Minister Edward Natapei, became deputy prime minister. The party had a strong result in the September 2008 elections, gaining 11 of the 52 results, making this party the largest one in Parliament and allowing Natapei to return as prime minister. After multiple attempts to remove Natapei, he was forced out by a vote of no confidence on 2 December 2010, replaced by opposition leader Sato Kilman. Natapei was temporarily reinstated on 16 June 2011 when the Supreme Court of Vanuatu ruled Kilman's election as prime minister violated the Vanuatu constitution. A new election was held on 26 June of that year, in which Kilman was reinstated. The party lost three seats in the parliamentary elections of 30 October 2012; however, it remained the largest single party in parliament. The name of the Vanua'aku Party means \\"Party of Our land\\" in English (from the word vanua). It supports socialist economic policies and is mostly supported by English speakers.

It was founded by Vanuatu's independence leader Walter Lini when he broke away from the Vanua'aku Pati, alongside businessman ƒêinh VƒÉn Th√¢n. It is a social democratic party which traditionally received most of its support from English speakers. In 1991, Walter Lini, who had served as prime minister of Vanuatu for 12 years as a member of the Vanua'aku Pati and lost his position after a split in the party, founded the National United Party, soon becoming its leader. Following Walter's death in 1999, his brother Ham Lini became party leader. The party became one of the largest political parties in Vanuatu along with the Vanua'aku Party and the Union of Moderate Parties, and participated in coalitions with both at various times. In the July 2004 elections, the party won 10 of the 52 seats, and because of losses by the other major parties, it became the largest single party in Parliament. In December 2004, Ham Lini became prime minister, the first member of NUP to take this position while a member of the party. At the 2008 elections, the NUP lost 2 seats, and received a total of 8 seats in Parliament, becoming the second largest party. Ham Lini was not able to form another government, but the National United Party became an important coalition partner in the new government formed by the Vanua'aku Party. After the 2012 elections NUP remained in coalition with the People's Progress Party in the Kilman government. The party went into opposition upon the election of Moana Carcasses as Prime Minister in 2013. It returned to government in 2014 when a motion of no confidence brought the government of Joe Natuman to power, with Ham Lini as Deputy Prime Minister, then returned to opposition in 2015 during the Sato Kilman government.

It tells the story of untouchability through folklore and Bhavai. Bhavni Bhavai was Ketan Mehta's debut film and received a critical acclaim. Mehta won the prestigious Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, while Meera Lakhia won National Film Award for Best Production Design at the 28th National Film Awards. The film was selected for a festival at the Museum of Modern Art and received UNESCO Club Human Rights award at the Three Continents Festival. Plot The story begins with a group of Harijans migrating to a city and pausing for a night. An elderly (Om Puri) starts narrating the story of King Chakrasen. King Chakrasen (Naseeruddin Shah) badly wants an heir, but neither of his two queens conceives a child. One day Chakrasen smells a foul odor at his darbar. Upon investigating he is told the place is not cleaned because bhangis are on holiday for a wedding. Angrily, he summons them immediately and orders their flagellation as punishment. Meanwhile, his spy brings the information that his people are conspiring against the king. On the advice of his prime minister (Benjamin Gilani), he decides to declare a war against the neighbouring state, as a distraction. Unknown to the king, his prime minister is having an affair with his younger queen (Suhasini Mulay). Before the king can declare a war, the neighbouring king decides to attack for the similar reasons. Chakrasen's army wins the war but suffers major brutality. At the same time, the king receives the news that his elder queen is expecting a child. Hearing this news, the jealous young queen and prime minister conspires with the royal astrologer and tells the king that if the king sees the face of the newborn, he will die immediately. Fearing for his life, the king orders killing of the newborn. The soldiers, ordered to kill the child, have a change of heart. They put him in a wooden box and let go of him in the river. One of the bhangis, Malo Bhagat (Om Puri), finds the box and decides to raise 'Jeevo' with his wife, Dhuli (Dina Pathak), as his own. While in the kingdom, the royal astrologer suggests that if the king wants a child, he must build a stepwell and the king agrees to it. Years pass by, the work on stepwell continues, but they can't find the water. Jeevo (Mohan Gokhale) grows up and falls in love with gypsy girl, Ujam (Smita Patil). The royal astrologer accidentally discovers that Jeevo is the son of the king and tells the king that the king must sacrifice 'Batress Lakshano Purush' (a man with 32 qualities), if he wants water in the stepwell and Jeevo is the only eligible man besides the king himself. The army sets out to capture Jeevo, but he runs away. Ranglo (jester) (Nimesh Desai) learns the truth and decides to inform the elder queen. Before that, the prime minister captures him and puts him in jail. Jeevo makes a plan with Ujam and tells the king that if he agrees to end the untouchability of his caste, then he'll surrender ‚Äî else he'll kill himself and the king won't be able to complete the sacrifice. After consulting his ministers, Chakrasen reluctantly agrees to the demand. On the day of the sacrifice, Ranglo escapes from the prison and tells the king that Jeevo is his own son, to which king is delightful and aborts the execution. The stepwell suddenly starts filling up with water. As the story approaches the end, one of the Harijans stops the elder and tells him not to lure the children with false 'happy endings' and narrates his own alternate ending. In the alternate ending, Ranglo doesn't arrive to tell the truth and sacrifice proceeds as planned, but there is still no water in the stepwell. Unable to bear the shock of their son's death, Jeevo's mother dies and Malo curses the king and commits suicide in the stepwell. Upon Malo's death, stepwell gets over-flooded, killing king and his ministers with him. The final sequence is interspersed with the footage of violent protests of Indian independence movement. Production Rani ki vav, where the final sequence was filmed. =Development= After graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India, Ketan Mehta was working for a satellite channel. Through his travels in villages, he came across the problems faced by rural population, specifically untouchability. He also came across Dhiruben Patel's play Bhavni Bhavai, ‚Äî which back then was performed as a Bhavai ‚Äî and decided to turn it into a movie. He was also inspired by Achhutno Vesh, a Bhavai performance. For production, the people associated with had formed a cooperative, the Sanchal Film Cooperative Society. The film was made on a meager budget of , with funding from NFDC. Most of the actors, including Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Smita Patil agreed to work without any compensation Naseeruddin Shah initially declined the role, because of his previous experience of working with Ketan Mehta, when the latter directed Eug√®ne Ionesco's play The Lesson for him. Ketan Mehta persisted and Naseeruddin finally agreed to do it because of his liking for the film, though he was hesitant about playing the role of a \\"Bumbling Raja\\". =Filming= Ketan Mehta filmed Bhavni Bhavai with distancing effect and the use of comic characters. Hence, the film is dedicated to Bertolt Brecht and Goscinny, the creator of Ast√©rix. It is also dedicated to the inventor of the Bhavai, Asaita Thakar, who was a Brahmin outcast and lived among the lower caste communities. The Bhavai evolved into one of India's most energetic folk music and dance- dramas. The final sequence of the stepwell and sacrifice was filmed at the World Heritage Site, Rani ki vav in Patan, Gujarat. The chief theme of the film is struggles of Harijans. The film also presents a medieval story in modern ways. Instead of linear story, it has a circular structure.

Critical reception Bhavni Bhavai received a wide critical acclaim and is considered one of the best Gujarati films of all time. It was considered path-breaking for dark humour and satire because most of films of the time were based on mythology and religious stories. The film was also praised for then-novel technique of 'breaking the fourth wall'. The New York Times described it as \\"Enhanced by interesting costumes and incisive dialogue, the fable combines comedy and social commentary as it moves through its classic tale.\\" Variety called it \\"A delightful didactic fable with sharp Brechtian influences that works on practically all levels.\\" Khalid Mohamed of Times of India said, \\"like a lightening red Bhavni Bhavai, the Gujarati Film is very special ‚Äì inventive, moving and fine grained ‚Äì the film is so simple, song filled and entertaining that it is well along its way before you recognise it as a tour do farce it actually is.\\" American film critic J. Hoberman called the movie \\"the finest film I saw in India\\" and described it as stunningly photographed and universally accessible. Director Sudhir Mishra has said that Bhavni Bhavai was one of the films that inspired him to take up filmmaking. = Accolades = Mehta won the prestigious Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, while Meera Lakhia won National Film Award for Best Production Design at the 28th National Film Awards.

Despite the obvious setback, Vohor was able to form a coalition government in August 2004, but lost a confidence vote four months later. From then until the 2008 elections, Vohor and the UMP sometimes were coalition partners in the Lini government, and at other times were in the opposition, serving as the largest opposition force.

He was baptised on 4 April 1775 at Monkton Farleigh,The Complete Peerage vol.XIIpI, p.85. with the name of Edward Adolphus Seymour, but later changed it to Edward Adolphus St. Maur, in the belief it was the original ancient form of the name. In 1793 he succeeded his father in the dukedom. In 1795, in the company of Reverend John Henry Michell, he undertook a tour through England, Wales and Scotland, which he recorded in a journal, published in 1845.Michell, John Henry, Rev. The Tour of the Duke of Somerset, and the Rev. J. H. Michell, Through Parts of England, Wales, and Scotland in the Year 1795, R. Clay, London 1845 The tour took him as far as the Isles of Staffa and Iona in the Hebrides. He was a patron of the Free Church of England. He was a gifted mathematician and served as president of the Linnean Society of London from 1834 to 1837 and as president of the Royal Institution from 1826 to 1842. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1837 he was made a Knight of the Garter by Queen Victoria. Seymour was also set to serve as the first President of the Astronomical Society of London (later the Royal Astronomical Society), having been unanimously elected to this post at the Society's second public meeting on 29 February 1820. However, he was persuaded to resign the position within days of his election by his friend (and then President of the Royal Society) Joseph Banks, who strongly opposed the establishment of a specialist society for astronomy.

Upon his death, despite leaving three married daughters, the dukedom passed by law to his heir male, his younger brother, with whom he had developed an enmity after the latter called his wife Georgiana Sheridan a \\"low-bred greedy beggar woman, whose sole object was to get her hands on the property and leave it away from the direct heirs\\".Masters, The Dukes, 1980 The 12th Duke bequeathed Stover and its priceless contents, including the Hamilton treasures, in trust for his illegitimate grandson Harold St. Maur, which caused uproar on the part of his younger brother the 13th Duke, who considered the treasures to be family heirlooms which should have passed to him.

When her father suffers a stroke, she calls for local Dr. Charu Das, who arrives on his bicycle and prescribes treatment for her father. He comes often, more on the pretext of seeing her than her father. Eventually, they get married. Years pass by and Charu is engrossed in treating patients, leaving Maya alone to reflect on her own fate and life. And it is not long before a young man named Rudra enters her life and an affair follows. This does not last long, as a much younger man Lalit (Shah Rukh Khan) now enters her life and they begin a passionate affair. But again, Maya is not satisfied as she longs for more than carnal needs. All the time, this bored housewife gets attracted to costly objects and spends recklessly on clothes and furniture, even if she has to borrow money. She mortgages her house to Lalaji. Finally, reality catches up with her. Lalaji brings a court order to take possession of her house. Rudra and Lalit desert her and this leads her to drink a mystical drink that was earlier being advertised on the streets to give you one wish on the condition you had a pure heart. The drink causes her to flash brightly and disappear. This leaves two investigators to probe who or what really killed Maya.

Early life and career Cooper was born November 1, 1815, most likely in Amite County, Mississippi. His father, David Cooper, was a physician and Baptist minister.\\"This Week in the Civil War: Douglas Hancock Cooper Biography.\\" Civil War Week. August 28, 2011. Accessed October 26, 2016. His mother was Sarah Davenport. Cooper attended the University of Virginia from 1832 until 1834; his classmates included future Civil War generals Carnot Posey, Lafayette McLaws, and John B. Magruder. Cooper returned home to take up farming on \\"Mon Clova\\", his plantation in Wilkinson County, Mississippi in the Cold Springs community, which was a tiny village between Woodville and Natchez. He married Mary Collins of Natchez and had 7 children. Entering politics, he was elected in 1844 to serve as a Whig in the Mississippi State Legislature. Cooper helped to raise a regiment during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1st Mississippi Rifles, and served as a captain under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, participating in the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista. He was cited for bravery and gallantry at the Battle of Monterrey. In 1853, through the influence of Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who served with Cooper at the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Battle of Buena Vista, President Franklin Pierce appointed Cooper as the Federal agent to the Choctaw tribe. Cooper helped peaceably remove them to Indian Territory. Three years later, he also became the agent to the Chickasaw tribe, who respected and trusted Cooper and soon officially adopted him as a full member. In 1858, he led a militia composed of Choctaw and Chickasaw volunteers against Comanche marauders. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Cooper pledged his allegiance to the Confederacy. In May, Secretary of War Leroy Pope Walker sent Cooper a letter authorizing him to \\"take measures to secure the protection of these tribes in their present country from the agrarian rapacity of the North.\\" He raised a regiment known as the 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles and was commissioned as its colonel. Given brigade command, Cooper pursued the Creek Indian leader Opothleyahola in November and December, when the latter led his loyal Union followers toward Kansas. Cooper's brigade fought at the battles of Round MountainOn this date in Civil War history - November 19, 1861 Battle of Round Mountain and Chusto-Talasah,On this date in Civil War history - December 9, 1861 Battle of Chusto-Talasah winning a decisive victory at Chustenahlah.On this date in Civil War history - The Battle of Chustenahlah Dec. 26, 1861 In 1862, Cooper led Confederate troops at the battles of Elkhorn Tavern, Newtonia and Honey Springs. He was promoted to brigadier general on May 2, 1862, and was named district commander of the Indian Territory on September 29, 1862. This promotion put him in command of all \\"... (Confederate) Indian troops in the Trans-Mississippi Department on the borders of Arkansas.\\" Rumors circulated that the Indians were dissatisfied with Cooper. To refute this, letters of support from Indian leaders were sent to Richmond, Virginia, to President Jefferson Davis. Cooper commanded the \\"Indian Brigade\\" in Indian Territory during Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's second invasion of Missouri in 1864. In 1865, Cooper was appointed Superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Confederacy's collapse accelerated after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox in 1865. The Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes surrendered in April 1865, and their troops returned home immediately. Cooper ordered the surrender of all white Confederate troops in Indian Territory in June, 1865. Afterward, he swore allegiance to the United States government, and was formally pardoned in April, 1866. Postbellum activities After the war, Cooper continued to live in the Indian Territory and was an ardent supporter of Choctaw and Chickasaw land claims against the Federal government. He died of pneumonia on April 29, 1879, at Fort Washita (in what is now Bryan County, Oklahoma) and was buried in the old fort cemetery in an unmarked grave.\\"This Week in the Civil War: Douglas Hancock Cooper biography.\\" Civil War Week.

In single- player games, it is often obtained as treasure or looted from defeated enemies, and loot is considered distinct from items purchased from in-game shops. Loot is meant to reward the player for progressing in the game, and can be of superior quality to items that can be purchased. It can also be part of an upgrade system that permanently increases the player's abilities. In multiplayer games, loot may be provided in such a manner that only one player may acquire any given item. \\"Ninja-looting\\" is the resulting practice of looting items off enemies defeated by other players. Players may choose to employ a loot system to distribute their spoils. In a PVP situation, loot may be taken from a defeated player. In role-playing video games, loot often forms the core economy of the game, in which the player fights to obtain loot and then uses it to purchase other items. Loot may often be assigned to tiers of rarity, with the rarer items being more powerful and more difficult to obtain. The various tiers of rarity are often indicated by particular colors that allow a player to quickly recognize the quality of their loot. The concept of color-coded loot rarity was popularized with the 1996 game Diablo, whose designer, David Brevik, took the idea from the roguelike video game Angband.  Loot boxes  Loot boxes are a particular type of randomized loot system that consists of boxes that can be unlocked through normal play, or by purchasing more via microtransaction. The system has garnered a great deal of controversy for being too similar to gambling.

It was established in 1882 from the Abbey of Engelberg, Switzerland. The abbey, located on the top of Mount Angel, a , has its own post office separate from the city of Mt. Angel's‚ÄîSaint Benedict. The Seminary is located within the Archdiocese of Portland, Oregon but it also serves as the major seminary for the Diocese of Baker, the Diocese of Boise, the Diocese of Great Falls- Billings, and the Diocese of Helena. The Archdiocese of Seattle sends its College Seminarians to Bishop White Seminary along with the Diocese of Spokane and the Diocese of Yakima. The seminarians are then given the choice of attending either University of Saint Mary of the Lake or Mount Angel.https://www.mountangelabbey.org/seminary- history/http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/ The seminary offers degrees to both lay students and those studying for the priesthood. The undergraduate school offers bachelor's degrees to seminarians in philosophy, literature, and religious studies. The graduate school offers master's degrees to both seminarians and lay students in theology, scripture studies, and philosophy. History =1882‚Äì1889: Establishment= View of the abbey Mount Angel Abbey was founded on October 30, 1882 by Benedictine monks who immigrated to the United States from Engelberg, Switzerland, who found the abbey's landscape to be similar of that which they had left in the Swiss Alps. It was conceived by Father Adelhelm Odermatt, a monk of Engelberg Abbey working in Missouri. Five years after the abbey's construction in 1882, the monks opened their school in 1887, under the name of Mount Angel College. In 1889, at the request of Archbishop William Gross of Oregon City, the monks established a seminary in conjunction with their college. =1901‚Äì1980: Abbey and college= In 1903, Father Thomas Meienhofer, also a native of Switzerland, became the first abbot, and in 1904, the community was officially declared an abbey, which meant that it became independent from its motherhouse in Switzerland. In 1926, a second fire in the abbey's history destroyed its monastery, forcing the community into private homes and the nearby parish school and rectory. The monks began rebuilding, and in 1930 erected Aquinas Hall, and a gymnasium in 1936. In 1939, the Abbey's first daughterhouse, Westminster Abbey, was established in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1946, the college was shut down so that the Abbey could focus on its seminary and boys' preparatory school. In 1959, a retreat house was constructed on the property to serve the spiritual needs of laypeople. In the early 1950s, the monastery became one of approximately 900 locations that would serve as emergency hospitals in the event of a nuclear war. In 1965, two new monasteries were started from Mount Angel Abbey: Ascension Priory in Idaho, and Our Lady of the Angels Priory in Cuernavaca, Mexico. In 1980, Father Bonaventure Zerr was elected as the seventh abbot, establishing a new library for not only seminarians, but for the use of scholarly research. The library at the abbey was designed by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Though the seminary has historically been the central focus of the abbey, it has also become open to non-seminarians seeking bachelor's degrees in philosophy and theology. In the 1970s, the Abbey community had a total of 125 monks living on the grounds, making it one of the largest Benedictine male communities in the United States. =1981‚Äìpresent: Seminary identity= Mount Angel Seminary, which was originally part of the now defunct Mount Angel College, serves numerous western dioceses and currently has approximately 200 students. The college was originally composed of seven schools, but as the college turned its focus toward the seminary, the two remaining schools are the liberal arts college and the graduate school of theology. The makeup of the seminary population is 40% Anglo-American and 60% minorities, primarily Hispanic, Vietnamese, and Filipino. The Seminary's main church has a tower that contains the largest free-swinging bells on the west coast. In 2006, a new seminary building received a Best Sustainable Award for Oregon and Washington. The following year, to commemorate the abbey's 125th anniversary, a new bell tower was erected. Academics The seminary has undergraduate and graduate programs. The undergraduate program is devoted towards a bachelor's degree in philosophy. Students may choose a double degree by studying one of two additional fields‚Äîreligious studies or literature. Many of the students from the undergraduate degree program continue on to study in Rome, San Francisco, Chicago, Leuven, or Washington, D.C. Library The Abbey library, reconstructed in 1980, is used by both seminary students and theology students. In addition to a wide range of books, the library also has an archive of medieval manuscripts dating back to the 12th century. The library has digitized multiple manuscripts, many from England, France, and Italy, through the Ethiopic Manuscripts Digitization Project. Museum The Mount Angel Abbey Museum is a collection of assorted artifacts, including mounted animal dioramas, rocks and minerals, serendipitous objects, antique liturgical vestments and religious items, and American Civil War memorabilia. The museum is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday.  Benedictine Brewery  In 2018, the third monastic brewery in the United States opened at the Abbey. Brewing is common among Trappists, but is also part of the Benedictine tradition‚Äîwhich is the order that occupies the Mount Angel Abbey, a 350-acre monastery secluded on a wooded butte above the small farming town of Mount Angel. Abbey monks are now brewing beer as part of a six-year project helmed by Father Martin and his understudy, Father Jacob, with guidance from beer writers Jeff Alworth and Stan Hieronymus.

It is long and mostly gravel- surfaced. It serves the communities of Faro and Ross River and intersects the Canol Road near Ross River. The highway is named for Robert Campbell, a nineteenth century Hudson's Bay Company fur trader and explorer. The first portion of the Robert Campbell Highway, between Watson Lake and Miner Junction, was built in the early 1960s as part of the project to complete road access to Tungsten, Northwest Territories. The portion east and north of Miner Junction is now the only portion still known as the Nahanni Range Road, and is Yukon Territorial Highway #10. During the late 1960s and continuing to 1971, highways were built to connect Carmacks with Ross River, with a spur road to Faro to serve the new lead-zinc mine that opened in 1969. Additional road work was also completed between Ross River and Miner Junction. The completed road complements the Canol Road, providing two loops and bringing year-round access to Ross River. The Campbell Highway is mostly gravel, and the most improved section is between Carmacks and Faro, where it has the most traffic from trucks hauling ore to Whitehorse and beyond. The highway was originally route 9, but became route 4 in 1978. For travellers from the south whose destination is Dawson City, this route is some 20 miles shorter than going through Whitehorse. However, many area users consider the route inferior, usually narrow, and sometimes hazardous.

It is called progressive passive income when the earner expends little effort to grow the income. Examples of passive income include rental income and any business activities in which the earner does not materially participate. Some jurisdictions' taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service in the United States of America, distinguish passive income from other forms of income, such as earnings from regular or contractual employment, and may tax it differently.  United States of America  The United States Internal Revenue Service categorizes income as active income, passive income, or portfolio income. It defines passive income as only coming from two sources, or \\"passive activities\\": rental activity or \\"trade or business activities in which you do not materially participate.\\"\\"Publication 925 ‚Äî Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules\\" Retrieved 2019-10-19. Other financial and government institutions also recognize it as an income obtained as a result of capital growth or in relation to negative gearing. Passive income is usually taxable. Active income is earned income including all taxable income and wages the earner receives for working. Active income includes wages, self-employment income, and material participation in an S corporation or partnership. Portfolio income is derived from investments such as dividends, interest, capital gains, and some royalties. = Passive activities = There are three kinds of passive activities: * Cash flows from property income, including profits from ownership of capital, rent from ownership of resources such as rental income, cash flows from property or any piece of real estate, and interest from owning financial assets. * Trade or business activities in which one does not materially participate during the year. * Royalties, which are payments made by one company (the licensee) to another company or person (the licensor) for the right to use the latter's intellectual property (book, music, video) or patent. However, the Internal Revenue Service only considers royalties passive income when they are \\"not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\\" Some limited partnerships may be considered passive as long as the limited partner does not have any role in the company and exchanges their capital investment for a share of the activities profit. = Rental activities = In order to be considered a rental activity, tangible property is used by customers and the income paid from the activity comes from the amount paid for the use of the property and is not considered a rental if: The average period of customer use is: * 7 days or less * 30 days or less and significant personal services were provided  Sources  There are more types of passive income than is shown in this article. In any case, it is preferable to consult with financial advisor first. * Bank deposit It is one of the most popular and simplest ways to gain passive income. A person gives a certain amount of money to a bank and takes interest every month. * Securities The profit, created by security, is in general inversely proportional to the risk it holds. * Bonds Bonds are debt securities issued by the state or company for gaining investments. By purchasing a bond, a person is lending savings to the issuer for a specified period. In return, he receives income at the very end of the bond validity period, or he can also earn so-called coupon income. * Dividend stocks It is a reliable way to generate income passively. However, it is important to mention the research to find stocks with desirable risk/income ratio.

In Book 1 of The Well-Tempered Clavier by Johann Sebastian Bach, Prelude No. 8 is written in E-flat minor while the following fugue is written in D-sharp minor. In Book 2, both movements are in D-sharp minor. Haydn's Piano Trio No. 41, H. XV.31 in two movements, composed in 1794/95, one of the \\"London Trios\\", is in the key of E-flat minor. Beethoven applied E-flat minor to the slow introduction in the sixth (last) movement of his Septet Op. 20 by adding accidentals while bearing the key signature of E-flat major/C minor (three flats). His oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives is also in this key. The final piece in Brahms' Klavierst√ºcke, Op. 118, No. 6, is in E-flat minor. The piece, like many pieces in this key, is dark and funereal, being based on the Dies irae chant. Schubert ended his Impromptus No. 2, D. 899 in E-flat minor, the parallel key to E-flat major, and so did Brahms in his Rhapsody No. 4, Op. 119. Chopin wrote his Etude No.6, Op. 10, his Polonaise No. 2, Op. 26, and his Prelude No. 14, Op. 28 in E-flat minor. Jan√°ƒçek's Piano Sonata, 1. X. 1905, arguably his best-known work for the piano, is in E-flat minor. Alkan composed the final movement for Symphony for Solo Piano in E-flat minor. One of the few symphonies written in this key is Prokofiev's Symphony No. 6, where none of these three movements ends in E-flat minor. A few other less well-known composers also wrote symphonies in this key, such as Andrei Eshpai, JƒÅnis Ivanovs (fourth symphony Sinfonia Atlantida, 1941), Ovchinnikov and Nikolai Myaskovsky. Aram Khachaturian wrote his Toccata in E-flat minor while studying under Myaskovsky. E-flat minor is the key in which Dmitri Shostakovich composed his fifteenth and final string quartet. Alexander Scriabin's Prelude No. 14 from his 24 Preludes, Op. 11, and 10th Mazurka from his Op. 3 are in E-flat minor, as well as Johannes Brahms's only independent Scherzo, Op. 4. Sergei Rachmaninoff's Elegie, Op. 3, No. 1, is in E-flat minor, as is his √âtude-Tableau, Op. 39, No. 5. The waltz \\"On the Hills of Manchuria\\" by Ilya Alekseevich Shatrov, about the loss of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, is written in E-flat minor. As mentioned, E-flat minor is common in Russian pieces. \\"On the Hills of Manchuria\\" is perhaps the most notable example. The extended orchestral introduction to part 2 of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony is in E-flat minor, as is the dark orchestral introduction to Beethoven's only oratorio, Christ on the Mount of Olives. Guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen has composed a number of pieces in E-flat minor, including the Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra. Jazz composition \\"Take Five\\" is also in this key.

Unlike in many other systems of law, there was previously no possibility of post factum legitimisation of a bastard. This situation was changed in 1926. Etymology The word bastard is from the Old French , which in turn was from Medieval Latin . In the modern French , the circumflex (√¢) merely represents the loss of the 's' over time. According to some sources, may have come from the word , which means pack saddle, the connection possibly being the idea that a bastard might be the child of a passing traveller (who would have a pack saddle). In support of this is the Old French phrase loosely meaning \\"child of the saddle,\\" which had a similar meaning. A more defined possibility is that such a traveller was a member of the , referring to the division of an army who arrived in town with their pack saddles the night before the troops, and left the day after, so that they may deal with all of the provisions of an army, and even do advanced scouting. This meant that for two days, they had unfettered access to all of the women in town, and were therefore the ones most likely to be the cause of the town's illegitimate offspring. (This explanation is apocryphal, but no attempt at dispute seems to have been proffered.) Another suggestion is that a group of travelling muleteers arrived, unloaded their mules, and took their pack saddles indoors and used them as bedding to sleep on. Common law origin Bastardy was not a status, like villeinage, but the fact of being a bastard had a number of legal effects on an individual. One exception to the general principle that a bastard could not inherit occurred when the eldest son (who would otherwise be heir) was born a bastard but the second son was born after the parents were married. The Provisions of Merton 1235 (20 Hen. 3 c. IX), otherwise known as the Special Bastardy Act 1235, provided that except in the case of real actions the fact of bastardy could be proved by trial by jury, rather than necessitating a bishop's certificate. Reform Post-hoc legitimisation was introduced under the Legitimacy Act 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5 c. 60) and the Family Law Reform Act 1969 (c. 46) allowed a bastard to inherit on the intestacy of his parents. In Medieval Wales In Medieval Wales, prior to its conquest by and incorporation in England, a \\"bastard\\" was defined solely as a child not acknowledged by his father. All children acknowledged by a father, whether born in or out of wedlock, had equal legal rights including the right to share in the father's inheritance. This legal difference between Wales and England is often referred to in the well-known \\"Brother Cadfael\\" series of Medieval detective mysteries.

Three submodels were produced. The MT900R was a racing version of the MT900. The basic car was updated as the MT900S for 2005, with the MT900S Photon being an optional performance package. The original MT900 was introduced in 2001 and the MT900S finished production in May 2011. Components for 25 MTs were produced as of January, 2005, though only about 35 road cars and 50 racing versions have officially been completed (c.20 of which are MT900S). The MT900 was the replacement for the Mosler Raptor. MT900 The MT900 was designed by Rod Trenne, who previously worked on the Corvette C5. The initials were for Mosler, Trenne, and the car's 900 kilogram (1984 lb) target weight. The MT900 used a carbon-fiber chassis with a LS1 V8 engine mounted amidships, powering the rear wheels. Power output is , with torque. A ZF transaxle, designed for Porsche, was mounted upside down to allow the engine to sit in front of the rear axle. The original MT900 weighed , much more than the target weight, but could still accelerate to in 3.5 seconds according to Car and Driver. The MT900 they tested could also do a 12.0 second quarter mile at , and they recorded a top speed of , limited by the redline. The MT900 pulled 1.02 g on the skidpad. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated and in city and highway driving, respectively. The car had a somewhat plain exterior designed for aerodynamics, with a low 0.25 coefficient of drag. List price was US$164,000. Sales were certainly slow, and only a single prototype was produced. MT900R Introduced at the same time as the basic MT900 was the race-ready MT900R. It was designed for use in various international motorsports series for an estimated price of $119,000. The MT900R made its competition debut at the 2001 24 Hours of Daytona, and would be campaigned by a factory Mosler team for the full season of the Grand American Road Racing Championship. The entry finished the year ninth in their class championship. For 2002, the French Perspective Racing team would become the full-season entry in Grand American and saw an improvement in performance. At Daytona the MT900R finished 13th overall and fifth in their class before winning at the next round at Homestead-Miami Speedway, helping the team to third in the championship. Rollcentre Racing and Balfe Motorsport (with aid from Rollcentre) would bring the Moslers to Europe in 2003, starting the British GT Championship year strong with three straight one-two finishes, before finishing the year with four more victories. The Rollcentre squad edged out Balfe for the championship that year. In Grand American, the Moslers were moved to the faster GTS class, but Perspective Racing improved on the previous year's Daytona effort with a ninth-place finish and the class victory. Mosler Automotive would take one more victory that season. Martin Short's Rollcentre Racing team also took their MT900R to a second-place finish in the inaugural Bathurst 24 Hour in 2002 at the famous Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, Australia. Rollcentre backed this up in the 2003 race with a fifth-place finish. The MT900R proved very quick on the circuit's Mountain and Conrod Straight's (both over 1 km in length), with Short finding he was able to match the speed of the Holden Monaro 427C's which used an Australian developed version of the larger 7.0L (427cui) V8 engine used in the Chevrolet Corvette C5-R's at Le Mans, as well as the 6.0L V12 powered Lamborghini Diablo GTR. Rollcentre and Balfe would continue in the British GT Championship in 2004, although Balfe would also enter the Spanish GT Championship. The Moslers would struggle in British GT and score no wins, but Balfe was able to earn two victories in Spanish GT, winning the drivers' championship by a mere point. 2005 would see Balfe entering the FIA GT Championship, although the car was not homologated and could not fight for points. Rollcentre would go on to win the Britcar 24 hours at Silverstone. Escuderia Bengala and Escuderia Motor Terrasa would compete in Spanish GT, while Eclipse Motorsport and Cadena GTC took over British GT competition. =MT900 GT3= Launched in late 2006, the Mosler MT900 GT3 was an attempt by Rollcentre Racing to adapt the MT900R for compliance to the new FIA GT3 category used in various championships. However, the lack of production Moslers led to the FIA rejecting the homologation and forcing Rollcentre to turn elsewhere. The car is allowed into the International GT Open, Australian GT Championship and Belcar series along with the British GT championship which runs to GT3 rules, but has not been approved for other series which use the GT3 category. MT900R GT3's use the LS7 7.0L V8 (427cui) rather than the LS1 5.7L (350cui) version from the original MT900R. MT900S The MT900 underwent several changes to become the MT900S, with from its Corvette Z06-derived LS6 V8. The car weighs without fuel. An early prototype MT900S, despite being up and down from the production version, posted a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 12 seconds flat. A newer edition with accelerated in 3.1 seconds in a Car and Driver test in early 2006. In June 2005, Mosler announced that they had reached EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) certification on the MT900S, allowing road car sales to begin in the United States. The price was set at $189,000 with two examples having been built as of January 2005.

While in the last century, the text has been more commonly referred to as \\"Pseudo-Aquinas\\", there are as well arguments in favour of Thomas Aquinas, to whom it has originally been attributed in some manuscripts. The translated title from Latin into English is \\"Rising dawn.\\" Authorship The argument against the authorship of Thomas Aquinas is that the style of Aurora consurgens does not correspond to that of Thomas Aquinas (except in the Fourth Parable, which in style and content is similar to the \\"Expositio\\" in \\"Symbolum Apostolorum\\", which is an oral lecture of Thomas of Aquin).E. v. Lippmann, Geschichte der Alchemie Vol. II. Springer, Berlin 1931, p. 28. Quoted by Marie-Louise von Franz in her book Aurora consurgens, discussing the authorship (¬ß592). According to von Franz the following arguments support the hypothesis of Thomas Aquinas being the author of Aurora Consurgens: Its author knows both the Bible and liturgy intimately, he quotes rather little of classical alchemical texts and mentions neither chemical recipes nor technical instructions, which indicates a clergyman to be its author. His praising of the poor is typical for a Dominican or a Franciscan. The passionately style of being gripped could result from an intrusion of the unconscious which ‚Äì as psychological experience tells - might have compensated a rather intellectual consciousness dominated by logic. The biography of Thomas Aquinas fits this, as, before his death, Thomas Aquinas is said to have had a disturbing vision, the content of which is not authenticated. But he is said to have interpreted the Song of Songs on his deathbed. Thus this treatise might well represent his last seminar or his last words. Overview Aurora consurgens is a commentary on the Latin translation of Silvery Waters by Senior Zadith (Ibn Umayl). It also refers to the Song of Songs, especially in its last (7th) parable (de confabulatione dilecti cum dilecta), which draws closely on it, in main parts paraphrasing it.Marie-Louise von Franz, Aurora Consurgens. A Document Attributed to Thomas Aquinas on the Problem of Opposites in Alchemy. First published 1966. Inner City Books, Toronto, 2000. . Unusual for a work of this type, the text is accompanied by about thirty-seven fine miniatures in watercolour. The illustrations are representations of alchemical symbols depicted in human or animal form. For example, mercury is depicted as a serpent, gold as the sun and silver as the moon.Obrist, Barbara. \\"Visualization in Medieval Alchemy\\". International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry. These illustrations incorporate some of the earliest Greek alchemical symbols known, found in the Authentic Memoirs of Zosimos of Panopolis. Illuminations The visuals found in Aurora consurgens are regarded by B. Obrist as alchemical metaphors that relate to human and animal procreation, procedures like calcination and putrefaction and other motifs. The manuscript also contains pictorial metaphors combined with glass vessels which depict the stages of the alchemical art of transformation. There are other metaphors found throughout the manuscript that are used in conjunction to create chains of metaphors. Some examples of this include cosmological and philosophical principles of the concepts like \\"two are one\\" and \\"nature vanquishes nature\\". Another illustration combines the motifs of Mercury decapitating the sun and the moon with a vase filled with silver and gold flowers. Depiction of the Ouroboros found in Aurora consurgens Another depicts two birds holding each other in a way that forms a circle which also symbolizes \\"two in one\\". This exemplifies the cosmic principle of unity, shown metaphorically as the dragon biting its tail. The ouroboros biting its tail has been stylized into a medallion of three concentric circles with inscriptions referring to the unity of everything and two natures attracting and dominating each other. It is associated with the symbols of the sun, moon, mercury, and sulfur. Another example includes the eagle and the dragon, which represent mercury as a volatile and as a solidified substance, respectively. Further, the unification of the opposite principles female/male, passive/active, cold/hot, moist/dry finds expression in the coupling of the sun and the moon, a cosmological motif of central importance since it symbolizes the generation of all things. Sage with a tablet within a church- like building (1420/30), the \\"house of wisdom\\", depicted in Aurora Consurgens (Codex Rhenoviensis 172, Rheinau, fol. 7r). Mu·∏•ammad ibn Umayl al-Tamimi‚Äôs book Al-mƒÅ' al-waraqƒ´ (The Silvery Water), also called Senioris Zadith tabula chymica, depicting his Great Vision. There are many common features between the illustration of Aurora Consurgens (Cod. Rhenov. fol. 7r) and that of Mu·∏•ammad Ibn Umails The Silvery Water. As Th. Abt suggests, the depiction of aurora is very likely to be an assimilated transmission of the depiction of Ibn Umails great alchemical vision in his Arabic The Silvery Water. Ibn Umail understood the symbolic pictograms on the tablet to represent the quintessence of alchemical knowledge. Both illustrations show a wise old man, sitting within a sanctuary, which has two rooms, and holding a tablet with symbolic pictograms. As well, three people pointing towards his direction and nine birds carrying weapons are depicted. Whereas the Arabic original shows a clearer distinction of two similar sized rooms, meant to represent an Egyptian temple, the Latin one shows a kind of church with two rooms of different size. Further, the Arabic original gives different coloured birds carrying swords instead of blue birds with bows, a woman in a window instead of a glass bottle on top of a pole, etc. This illustration may have inspired a rather similar depiction in Theatrum Chemicum (Basle, 1660) and in J.J. Mangets Bibliotheca Chemica (Geneva, 1702).Theodor Abt, \\"Ibn Umail's great Vision as Key to the ·∏§all ar-Rum≈´z\\" and \\"The Transmission of Ibn Umail's Vision to the Occident\\", both chapters in: Book of the Explanation of the Symbols.

Ferguson MS 6 (f. 220v), a couple depicted performing intercourse are hidden under a sheet and a blue bedspread. Their child is shown sleeping in a small rocking cradle, along with a young servant boy standing at the foot of the bed. At the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin MS Ger. Quatro. 848 (f. 30v), the related illustration has been defaced by being covered with a brown wash even though they appear to be covered to their waists by bed clothes. The child and young servant boy at the end of the bed were not damaged. This implies that the defacer was likely offended by the sexual nature of the scene. Another illustration in the Berlin manuscript (f. 18r), in which the couple makes love on a bed in a forest surrounded by a wattle fence, has also been defaced with wash, although not to the same degree as the image of the couple in bed. (f. 30v). These defacements suggest that some readers of alchemical texts were offended by visualizations of sexual analogies. Depiction of the zodiac menstrual cycle found in Aurora consurgens The explicitness of sexual details also varies from text to text. In an illustration from Z√ºrich Zentralbibliothek MS Rh. 172 (f. 11r), a menstruating woman bleeds profusely within a zodiac circle to illustrate her monthly cycle and the creation of menstruation and its use within the body. In the Spruch der Philosophien, Glasgow's Sp. Coll. Ferguson MS 6 (Pl. 3), the artist concealed her genitals under her skirt and reduced the blood flow, which obscures the meaning of the menstrual cloths she is holding up. Impact The representation of sexuality within these images also provides many points of comparison. The lovemaking of King and Queen in the Rosarium philosophorum series is derived from scenes in the Aurora consurgens and the Donum Dei series. Many patrons were interested in aesthetic and poetic contemplation and also in gaining the knowledge to perform alchemy. Aurora consurgens addresses all of the factors, implying it is directed to aristocratic and noble patrons. Some of these patrons include the margrave of Brandenburg and Barbara of Cilli, the wife of the emperor Sigismund.

Retrieved 25 October 2006. Nothing further was heard of her until 2005, when she made contact with the Scottish Daily Mail to tell the story of her intervening years. In 2013 she made a low- key return to public performances and made new recordings for the first time since the early 1970s.  Early life  McDonald was born in 1948 in Edinburgh and moved to Glasgow, at the age of 12, with her parents, She was privately educated before moving on to the Glasgow School of Art. Career On her first two albums, McDonald was backed up by many notables within the English folk-rock scene, including Richard Thompson, Dave Mattacks, Danny Thompson, Keith Tippett, Keith Christmas, the Fotheringay rhythm section, as well as Ian Whitman, Roger Powell and Michael Evans, then members of Mighty Baby. During the recording sessions for her third album in 1971, she mysteriously disappeared following a bad LSD trip. On 23 June 2005, by which time McDonald's albums had been reissued on CD, an article by Charles Donovan appeared in The Independent, the first high-profile piece about McDonald's disappearance. This prompted copycat features in local papers, the Glasgow Herald and the Scottish Daily Mail. It was the latter of these that caught the eye of McDonald herself. In November 2005, McDonald turned up in the offices of the Scottish Daily Mail and told them her story. She retreated from public life after a bad LSD trip left her paranoid and hallucinating, with a ruined voice. Living with her parents and working privately in Edinburgh, she met and married bookseller Gordon Farquhar; together, they lived a nomadic lifestyle in Scotland, living on welfare benefits and moving from house to house, and later tent to tent. In the 2005 interview McDonald said that her voice had improved and she was again interested in music, and the renewed interest in her work by the public surprised and gratified her. After that nothing more was heard of her until 2012, when she spoke to fRoots magazine. In the new interview she reveals that, since her partner's death earlier in the year, she has resumed contact with other folk musicians and is cautiously planning low- key live appearances and hoping to record new material.Ian Anderson, \\"Return journey,\\" fRoots 353/354, November/December 2012, pp33-7 In an October 2013 interview with The Guardian, she revealed that she had, in fact, recorded a new album, though she provided no further details about it.Shelagh McDonald, \\"Experience: I disappeared for 30 years,\\" The Guardian, 11 October 2013, Retrieved 13 October 2013 The new album, called Parnassus Revisited, with several new songs, was made available at gigs but has not been widely distributed. A collaboration with Galloway indie folk band The Razorbills, \\"Fame Fatale\\", was broadcast on Stuart Maconie's Freak Zone in 2014: Shelagh also performed with this band on a number of occasions, and with Nigel H. Seymour. On 16 January 2013, McDonald had made her first official public appearance, after more than 40 years away, as a guest of The False Beards at the Green Note, Camden, London. Among her half hour set of previously unrecorded material, she also played her version of the traditional song \\"Let No Man Steal Your Thyme\\" from her first album. A series of low-key appearances took place in 2014, mainly at Scottish venues, and a similar but longer tour in 2017, in collaboration with Nigel H. Seymour followed, which took in some appearances in England. It was also announced that a recording called Timescapes was forthcoming.

It is located in Wynnewood, a community in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania in Greater Philadelphia.\\"Community Profile .\\" Lower Merion Township. Retrieved on April 30, 2014. (contains maps of Lower Merion). The school was founded in 1845 in Philadelphia, near the current location of the United States Mint. Today it has an enrollment of more than 800 students from Nursery to grade 12. Informally known as \\"Friends' Central,\\" the school encompasses three divisions: Lower School (nursery through 5th grades), Middle School (6th through 8th) and Upper School (9th through 12th). The Middle and Upper Schools share their campus, and the Lower School occupies its own site. The school is widely known for the quality of its education, consistently as one of the top schools in the Philadelphia area. History Friends' Central School was founded in 1845 in Philadelphia at 4th Street and Cherry Street, serving as an upper school for the Quaker primary schools with grades 7 through 12. In 1857, the school moved to 15th and Race Street, remaining at this location until 1925, when it then moved to its current campus on City Avenue (formerly the Wistar Morris Estate). The main house of the estate, constructed in 1862, remains and serves as the administrative building of the school as well as an architectural focal point of the campus. In 1988, due to the growth of the student body, Friends' Central acquired the Montgomery School's property and relocated the lower school there. Recent expansion includes construction of the Shimada Athletic Center (2000) and the Fannie Cox Center for Science, Math and Technology (2003). In 2011, David Felsen retired after 23 years of service as headmaster; beginning in the 2012 school year, Craig Sellers was named Head of School. Emphasis and incorporation of Quaker values Quaker values such as community, service, equality and integrity are all incorporated into student life. All students attend a weekly Meeting for Worship on Wednesdays for 40 minutes, sharing messages when \\"moved to speak\\". The community convenes in one room in silence and individuals stand when expressing thoughts to the community. Students are also required to perform off-campus service for a set of mandatory hours. In the middle and upper school, students are required to take three courses concerning the history of the Society of Friends and the central philosophies of Quakerism from a non-religious perspective. In middle school, 5th and 7th grade learn the history and faith of Quakerism, and the 9th grade course further explores the Quaker faith and practice, focusing on a deeper understanding of the religion's history and its testimonies. 11th and 12th graders may take additional study in the origin and philosophy of religion in general. Academics Friends' Central School students achieved the highest average SAT scores in all three sections (Math, Verbal and Writing) of the 19 schools that had scores reported in Suburban Life Magazine's 2010 report on suburban Philadelphia private high schools. The scores were 649 in Math, 669 in Verbal, and 666 in Writing. This report also indicated that Friends' Central had a student-faculty ratio of 9:1, a yearly high school tuition of $25,400, and that 100% of the 93 students in the senior class went on to a four-year college. Of the 2009 graduating class, eight schools enrolled 30% of the senior class: The University of Pennsylvania (6), Muhlenberg College (4), Johns Hopkins (3), Haverford (3), Carnegie Mellon (3), Temple (3), Washington University in St. Louis (3), and Sarah Lawrence (3). Fourteen students enrolled at Ivy League institutions. Athletics Friends' Central has strong basketball and wrestling programs. From 2009-2012 Friends' Central won four consecutive Pennsylvania Independent Schools Boys' Basketball Championships.

Kinnamos in his epitome twice mentions Khalisioi in the Hungarian army. He first describes them as practising Mosaic law; though whether they were actually Jews is unclear because other editions state that they were Muslims. They were said to have fought against the Byzantine Empire as allies of the tribes of Dalmatia in 1154, during Manuel Comnenus's campaign in the Balkans. Prior to the years 889‚Äì92 some Khalis and Kabars (Kavars) of the Khazar realm had joined the Hungarian (Magyar) federation that had conquered and settled in Hungary. Another group had joined the Pechenegs. Al-Bakri (1014‚Äì1094) states that around 1068 A.D. there were considerable numbers of al-Khalis amongst the nomadic Muslim Pechenegs (Hungarian: Beseny≈ë), that lived around the southern steppes of Russia. He also mentions that the original al-Khalis living within the Khazar realm may have been foreign slaves from Byzantine Constantinople and/or other lands. The Pechenegs gave them the choice of staying in their country, where they could inter-marry or leave for another country of their choice. Anna Komnena in her Alexiad mentions a Pecheneg chief named Khalis. Abraham Harkavy hypothesized that the Khalyzians were refugees fleeing the destruction of their khaganate by the Kievan Rus in the 960s AD and the Pecheneg influx which followed in the 970s. A contemporary of Harkavy's, the Polish historian August Bielkowski, suggested that the Khalyzians were identical with the tribe known in Russian sources as the Khvalisy; hence they may have been connected to the Arsiya. The maternal ancestors of the Magyarized Pecheneg clan Aba, to which the Hungarian king Samuel Aba (1041‚Äì47) belonged, were according to Hungarian chronicles of Khwarazmian origin (de gente Corosmina, de Corosminis orta). The Khwarezmian connection Khwarezm is a city in present-day Uzbekistan, in the former Persian province of Khorasan. Since it was part of the silk road, it was known internationally, and had several different names in several different languages, including Byzantine Greek who called the products of this city \\"khalisios\\", which was masculine for \\"of the city of khalis.\\" A province of the Lower Volga The province of Khwalis (Khwali-As) on the lower Volga, was the realm of the trading Eastern Iranians; its twin city Amol/Atil, also called Sariycin/Khamlikh. It was ruled by a governor with the title of Tarkhan As- Tarkhan.

The route is signed on a north-south direction, from U.S. Route 222 Business (US 222 Bus.) in Reading northwest to US 11/US 15 in Shamokin Dam. PA 61 heads north from Reading through Berks County to Hamburg, where it meets Interstate 78 (I-78)/US 22. The route continues into the Coal Region in Schuylkill County and heads through Schuylkill Haven, Pottsville, Frackville (where it has an interchange with I-81), and Ashland. PA 61 passes through the southern part of Columbia County, where it turns west in Centralia, before it heads into Northumberland County and runs west through Mount Carmel, Kulpmont, Shamokin, and Sunbury. The route crosses the Susquehanna River into Snyder County and soon reaches its northern terminus. PA 61 roughly follows the alignment of the Centre Turnpike, a turnpike between Reading and Sunbury that was completed in 1814. The road between Reading and Sunbury became part of US 120 when the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926. In 1935, this section of road became part of US 122, a route than ran from US 1 in Oxford north to US 11/US 111 in Northumberland. US 122 saw multiple upgrades and realignments in the following years. In 1963, US 122 was decommissioned and PA 61 was designated onto the former alignment of US 122 between US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading and PA 147 in Sunbury. Upgrades and realignments continued to be made to PA 61. In 1990, the route was extended north from Sunbury to US 11/US 15 in Shamokin Dam. A section of PA 61 south of Centralia was closed in 1993 after the Centralia mine fire damaged the road and made it unsafe to travel on; this section was bypassed with a realignment to a parallel road through Byrnesville. The closed section of PA 61 was used by pedestrians and bicyclists and was covered with graffiti before being blocked to public access and covered with dirt in 2020.

PA 61 crosses the Shamokin Creek and turns to the north, heading through a gap in forested Little Mountain with the creek to the west and the Shamokin Valley Railroad to the east and entering Ralpho Township. The road passes commercial development and a coal mine in the community of Weigh Scales before it crosses to the west side of the Shamokin Creek, at which point it enters Shamokin Township. The route winds north through more woodland with some commercial areas, with the Shamokin Valley Railroad and the Shamokin Creek to the east. PA 61 curves northwest and intersects the southern terminus of PA 487 in the community of Paxinos. From here, the road curves west runs to the north of the residential community of Sunfftown before narrowing to a two-lane undivided road and heading through woodland. The route continues west through woodland with some farm fields and homes, running through the community of Stonington and bending to the northwest. PA 61 running concurrently with PA 147 in Sunbury PA 61 heads west and becomes the border between Upper Augusta Township to the north and Rockefeller Township to the south, passing through forests with some fields and residential development. The road fully enters Upper Augusta Township and runs through residential areas with some nearby farmland and woodland, becoming State Street. The route comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 890 in the community of Hamilton. From here, PA 61 turns north and crosses under the Shamokin Valley Railroad, at which point it enters the city of Sunbury. The road becomes Market Street and curves west, coming to a bridge over the Shamokin Creek. The route passes near businesses and bends southwest, coming to an intersection with the southern terminus of southbound PA 61 Truck at Wolverton Street. PA 61 curves west and becomes lined with homes, bending to the west-northwest and passing a mix of homes and businesses. The road enters the commercial downtown of Sunbury and intersects the beginning of northbound PA 61 Truck at North 5th Street. The route passes through more of the downtown and crosses Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line at- grade, at which point it splits into a one-way pair with a town square between the one-way streets and passes north of the Northumberland County Courthouse. PA 61 becomes a two-lane road again and passes homes before it reaches an intersection with PA 147 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River. At this point, PA 61 turns south-southwest for a concurrency with PA 147 on South Front Street, intersecting the beginning of southbound PA 61 Truck at Chestnut Street. The two routes continues south between the river to the west and a mix of homes and commercial areas to the east. Farther south, the road runs to the west of residential areas. PA 61 splits from PA 147 at an interchange, heading west as a four-lane undivided road to cross the Susquehanna River on the Veterans Memorial Bridge, leaving Sunbury and running through Upper Augusta Township while crossing the river. Upon crossing the river, the route enters the borough of Shamokin Dam in Snyder County and reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with US 11/US 15. History On March 25, 1805, the Centre Turnpike Road Company was chartered to build the Centre Turnpike, a turnpike running from Reading northwest to Sunbury along the rough alignment of present-day PA 61. Construction of the Centre Turnpike began in 1808 and was completed in 1814. Following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, what is now PA 61 was designated as Legislative Route 160 between Reading and Hamburg, Legislative Route 141 between Hamburg and Schuylkill Haven, Legislative Route 140 between Schuylkill Haven and Pottsville, and Legislative Route 161 between Pottsvile and Sunbury. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Sunbury was designated as part of US 120, a route that ran from Philadelphia northwest to Erie. At this time, the entire length of US 120 between US 22 in Reading and Sunbury was paved. In 1927, PA 42 was designated concurrent with US 120 between Reading and Centralia, PA 45 was designated concurrent with US 120 between Ashland and Shamokin, and PA 55 was designated concurrent on the section of US 120 between Shamokin and Sunbury. The concurrent state routes were removed from US 120 between Reading and Sunbury in 1928. In May 1935, the eastern terminus of US 120 was truncated to US 220 in Lock Haven. US 122 was designated in April 1935 to run from US 1 in Oxford north to US 11/US 111 in Northumberland, replacing PA 42 between Oxford and Reading and US 120 between Reading and Northumberland, effective in May 1935. US 122 was rerouted to bypass Orwigsburg to the southwest by 1940, having previously followed Brick Hill Road, Market Street, and present-day PA 443 through the town. In the 1930s, US 122 was widened to a multilane road between Reading and Leesport, from a point north of Shoemakersville to Hamburg, between a point south of Schuylkill Haven and Pottsville, for a short distance south of Frackville, and for a short distance north of Shamokin. US 122 was upgraded to a multilane road in the 1940s between Leesport and north of Shoemakersville, between Port Clinton and south of Orwigsburg, between St. Clair and south of Frackville, between Frackville and Shamokin, between north of Weigh Scales and north of Paxinos, and for a short distance north of Stonington. In the 1940s, US 122 was realigned to bypass Center City Pottsville to the east along Pottsville Boulevard between US 209 in Pottsville and south of St. Clair, having previously followed Centre Street through Center City Pottsville and Nichols Street and Ann Street between Pottsville and St. Clair By 1953, US 122 was rerouted to bypass Hamburg to the west on a divided highway between south of Hamburg and Port Clinton, having previously followed 4th Street and Port Clinton Avenue between Hamburg and Port Clinton. US 122 was upgraded to a divided highway in the 1950s between north of Leesport and north of Shoemakersville, along the bypass of Orwigsburg, from north of St. Clair to south of Frackville, between Ashland and the border between Columbia and Northumberland counties, and between Weigh Scales and Paxinos. In the 1950s, US 122 was upgraded to a divided highway from Schuylkill Haven through Pottsville to south of St. Clair, being realigned to bypass Mount Carbon. This alignment of US 122 bypassed the previous alignment that followed Centre Street through Mount Carbon north to US 209 in Pottsville. US 122, which had been replaced with PA 10 between Oxford and Morgantown in the 1950s, was decommissioned in 1963. The section of US 122 between Morgantown and Reading became a northern extension of PA 10 while the section between Reading and Sunbury was designated PA 61. When designated, PA 61 ran from US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading northwest to PA 147 in Sunbury. In 1966, PA 54 was designated concurrent with PA 61 between Ashland and north of Atlas. In the 1960s, PA 61 was upgraded to a divided highway between north of Tuckerton and north of Leesport, between north of Shoemakersville and south of Hamburg, and between Port Clinton and Deer Lake. The section of PA 61 through Pottsville was renamed Claude A. Lord Boulevard in the 1960s. By 1989, PA 61 was realigned to bypass St. Clair to the west along a divided highway, having previously followed 2nd Street through the town. In 1990, the northern terminus of PA 61 was extended from PA 147 in Sunbury across the Susquehanna River to US 11/US 15 in Shamokin Dam. A view of the closed, damaged section of PA 61 south of Centralia Because of the long-term coal mine fire in Centralia, the original alignment of PA 54/PA 61, which went from Centralia to Ashland, has been permanently closed because the road has severely opened up and buckled extensively. This branch was repaired in 1983 for $500,000; then in 1992 it was deemed too expensive to repair again. In 1993, the branch was permanently closed, and as a result of this, graffiti were scattered along the closed portion of the roadway. In 1999, Byrnesville Road (SR 2002), located directly south of the closed section of PA 61, was upgraded and now carries PA 61, bypassing the section of PA 61 which was damaged by the underground mine fire in Centralia. By 2000, PA 54 was rerouted from PA 61 between Ashland and Atlas to bypass Centralia to the southwest along PA 901 and three quadrant routes. The closed section of the road was used by pedestrians and bicyclists and was covered with graffiti. The closed portion of PA 61 was known as \\"Graffiti Highway\\". In 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) vacated ownership of the closed section of PA 61, which reverted to adjacent property owners, mostly to Pitreal Corporation, a subsidiary of Pagnotti Enterprises. Work on blocking public access by covering the abandoned highway with dirt took place in April 2020. In September 2012, PennDOT began a project to widen and improve the section of PA 61 through Deer Lake as the road saw a high accident rate. The project, which cost $35 million, widened the road from three lanes to four lanes between the south end of the PA 895 concurrency in Molino and Brick Hill Road north of Deer Lake and added traffic lights and jughandles at intersections. In addition, a new southbound roadway was built through Deer Lake, with the original roadway becoming the northbound lanes. The widening of PA 61 through Deer Lake was completed in 2015. Panoramic view of the closed section of PA 61 south of Centralia Future As part of the Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation Project, PA 61 is planned to continue westward from its current northern terminus, ending instead at a junction with a new limited-access roadway carrying US 15. Instead of joining with PA 147 briefly in Sunbury, the two will run together from the southern end of the current duplex to the new northern terminus at US 15. Major intersections PA 61 Truck =Reading= Pennsylvania Route 61 Truck (PA 61 Truck) is a truck route of PA 61 bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over Laurel Run in Muhlenberg Township, on which trucks over 34 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 12, PA 183, and US 222. PA 61 Truck was signed in 2013. =Sunbury= Pennsylvania Route 61 Truck (PA 61 Truck) is a truck route of PA 61 in Sunbury that helps larger vehicles avoid a narrow town square area and a tight intersection with PA 147. The northbound truck route splits from PA 61 in the downtown area by heading north on two-lane undivided North 5th Street for two blocks. Northbound PA 61 Truck turns west-northwest onto one-way Arch Street, passing a mix of homes and businesses and crossing Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line at- grade. The northbound truck route ends at PA 147 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, which heads south to provide access to PA 61. The southbound truck route begins at PA 61/PA 147 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, heading east-southeast on one-way Chestnut Street. Southbound PA 61 Truck runs past residences and businesses, crossing Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line at-grade. The truck route continues southeast onto Wolverton Street, passing between homes to the north and industry to the south and curving east. The road runs to the north of the Shamokin Valley Railroad and bends northeast past more homes and commercial establishments. Southbound PA 61 Truck ends at an intersection with PA 61 in the eastern part of Sunbury.

History In 1977, which saw the start of an outright nationalist movement on the left, anti-nationalist (loyalist) Caldoche leader Jacques Lafleur founded the Rally for Caledonia (RPC) which became the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) in 1978 following its affiliation with the Rally for the Republic (RPR) in France. The RPCR was originally a big tent for a large majority of loyalists, whether they were liberals or close supporters of Jacques Chirac (such as Lafleur). However, the first cracks in the RPCR appeared in 1995, when Lafleur broke his historical friendship with Chirac to endorse Balladur in the 1995 presidential election in France. Didier Leroux, the strongman of the local managerial trade union and a close supporter of Jacques Chirac, left the RPCR to found a party named A New Caledonia for All. However, the RPCR remained, by far, the largest loyalist party in the 1994 and 1999 elections. It became the Rassemblement-UMP after the creation of the Union for a Popular Movement in France in 2002, but kept the RPCR acronym. However, the RPCR started massively cracking ahead of the 2004 elections. In 2004, a group of RPCR dissidents who opposed Lafleur‚Äôs authoritarian leadership formed the Future Together party. The new party included Marie-No√´lle Th√©mereau, who had left the RPCR in 2001 and supported Lionel Jospin in the 2002 French presidential election; Harold Martin, Lafleur‚Äôs heir apparent but excluded in 2003 for running a dissident list in the 2001 local elections; and Philippe Gom√®s, a friend of Martin. In the 2004 election, the RPCR received its worst result to date, obtaining 24.43% and only 16 Congressmen. Future Together won 22.69% and 16 seats, but it won more votes than the RPCR in the loyalist stronghold of South Province. Gom√®s became Provincial President, and Harold Martin became President of the Government of New Caledonia. In 2005, Lafleur announced his intentions to step down in favour of Pierre Frogier, who represented New Caledonia's 2nd constituency and was a close supporter of the President of the UMP in France, soon-to-be- President Nicolas Sarkozy. Frogier was seen as Lafleur's chosen successor. However, he reneged on this decision and ran against Frogier for the RPCR leadership at the party congress. Frogier defeated Lafleur by a large margin, and Lafleur left the RPCR to form the Rally for Caledonia (RPC). Despite its decline, the RPCR held both of New Caledonia's seats in the French National Assembly in the 2007 elections. In the 1st constituency, representing the capital city of Noum√©a, Ga√´l Yanno defeated a Kanak nationalist but most notably the incumbent, Jacques Lafleur, who had won the seat since 1986. In the 2009 election, the RPCR obtained a lower result than in 2004, despite the division in Future Together. The RPCR obtained only 20.3% and a mere 13 Congressmen. However, the RPCR regained its status as largest party in New Caledonia and achieved first place in the South Province.

The name l'Avenir Ensemble reflects the party's desire to unite New Caledonians of all ethnic groups (White Europeans, Melanesian Kanaks, Polynesian immigrants, etc.) into a shared future, rejecting the ethnic oppositions of the hitherto dominant parties of New Caledonia (White anti- independence parties vs. Kanak pro-independence parties). L'Avenir Ensemble believes in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural future for New Caledonia. History The party's predecessor, A New Caledonia for All (Une Nouvelle- Cal√©donie pour Tous, UNCT) or Alliance (after 1998) was founded in 1995 by Didier Leroux, a former member of the dominant anti-nationalist Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR). Leroux was an early opponent of Jacques Lafleur within the RPCR. Leroux led the NO campaign in the Noum√©a Accord referendum in 1998. Despite Leroux being Fran√ßois Bayrou's representative on the island and a member of Bayrou's Union for French Democracy (and now MoDem), a number of members of the original Alliance are members of the Union for a Popular Movement. The then-dominant loyalist party, the RPCR was weakened in 2003 and 2004 by a series of dissidents, who opposed Jacques Lafleur's domination of the RPCR. These dissidents included Marie-No√´lle Th√©mereau, who had left the RPCR in 2001; Harold Martin, once Lafleur's dauphin but excluded in 2003 for running a dissident list in the 2001 election; and Philippe Gom√®s, a friend of Martin. These dissidents formed a party called Future Together. In the 2004 provincial elections, the party shocked observers by winning as many seats as the RPCR (16 seats nationally, though it polled slightly fewer votes than the RPCR). As a result, Th√©mereau (and later Martin) became President of the Government of New Caledonia. Gom√®s became President of the loyalist stronghold, the South Province. In the South, the party had polled more votes than the RPCR, despite the province being considered the RPCR's stronghold on the island. The party split in 2008. This split started in the 2007 legislative election, when Gom√®s ran in New Caledonia's 1st constituency despite Didier Leroux being supposed to run. Though both ran, and both polled 14%, they got third and fourth leaving the RPCR candidate Ga√´l Yanno against the candidate of the nationalist FLNKS, which Yanno easily defeated. Martin was also defeated running the New Caledonia's 2nd constituency. Poor results in the 2008 local elections, including the capital, Noum√©a, precipitated an open split between Gom√®s on one side and Martin-Leroux on the other. In 2008, Gom√®s and 12 Future Together Congressmen and women (including Th√©mereau) formed Caledonia Together. In the 2009 provincial elections, the party, associated with the Movement for Diversity of senator Simon Loueckhote, placed third winning (behind the winners, the RPCR, and Caledonia Together) 11.71% and only 6 seats (8 including the party's smaller allies).

It was founded in 1984 at a congress of various political parties. Its supporters are mostly from the Kanak indigenous population but also include supporters from other ethnic communities. History This is composed of the Caledonian Union (UC) (a centre-left formerly multi-ethnic party dating back to the early postwar period) on the one hand and the National Union for Independence (UNI) on the other. The UNI includes Melanesian Progressive Union (a political movement based on the island's west coast and mainly around the village of Poya, where its founder, the late Edmond Nekiriai hails from), the Oceanian Democratic Rally (a Polynesian (Wallisian-and-Futunian) based party) and the Party of Kanak Liberation (PALIKA), a more radical party founded by left-leaning students that came back from France after the May 1968 riots. Both the UC and UNI are of approximately equal size, and with varying rhetoric. However, all support the independence of New Caledonia. The party boycotted the 1987 independence referendum.New Caledonia (France), 13 September 1987: Status Direct Democracy The party has been divided since the early 1990s between the Caledonian Union and UNI, and, as a result, the two factions often run candidates and lists against each other and neither can agree on a leader of the FLNKS. The coalition only has a spokesperson, Victor Tutugoro. An attempt to re-unite the party was made on the occasion of the 2007 legislative elections in France, in which both New Caledonian constituencies were up for election. In New Caledonia's 1st constituency, Charles Washetine, a member of UNI-Palika ran with a Caledonian Union running mate. In New Caledonia's 2nd constituency, the leader of the Caledonian Union, Charles Pidjot, ran with a UNI-Palika running mate. However, both were defeated by the candidates of The Rally-UMP. The FLNKS ran a common list in the South Province in the 2009 election which obtained 8.82% and 4 seats in the province. In the province during the 2004 elections, the pro-independence faction was divided and did not win any seats.

History The Caledonian Union was born as a cross-community (multi-ethnic) autonomist party led by Maurice Lenormand, who was the island's sole representative in the French National Assembly. There he sat with the Popular Republican Movement, or MRP, and other Christian democratic parties in France. The party's first significant success was on February 8, 1953 with the election of 15 members of the Caledonian Union to the 25 seats General Council.Pierre Berg√®s, Maurice Lenormand, Roch Pidjot, Mat√©o Aripoindi, Rapha√´l Bouanaou√©, Kowi Bouillant, Andr√© Caron, Doui Matayo Wetta, Luther Enoka, Louis Eschembrenner, James Haeweng, Michel Kauma, Georges Newland, Elia Thidjine, Marc TivollierMembers of \\"Conseil General\\" from 1940 to 1957 , The Congress of New Caledonia (in French), 2004 However, the UC opposed to the arrival of Gaullist centralism in France, which undid most of the autonomist reforms of the French Fourth Republic (the Defferre laws). The UC grew more and more radical, and started flirting with independence, which eventually led to an outflow of Caldoches into new loyalist parties, such as the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic. Combined with corruption scandals, this weakened the party considerably. In 1977 in Bourail, the UC adopted a nationalist platform, supported by Jean-Marie Tjibaou (and the rare European nationalists, such as Maurice Lenormand and Pierre Declercq). In 1979, the UC joined with the Party of Kanak Liberation (FLNKS) and other parties to form the Nationalist Front, which became the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) in 1984. The UC was the largest faction in the FLNKS, led by Tjibaou. It was largely moderate, as opposed to the more radical Palika. Tjibaou was killed in 1989 by an extremist Kanak nationalist. In 2001, Roch Wamytan, the moderate leader of the UC, lost an election to Pascal Naouna, a radical. The UC has since broken with Palika within the FLNKS, which has no unitary president and is very divided. Charles Pidjot, Roch Pidjot's nephew, replaced Naouna in 2007. He died in 2012 and was then replaced himself by Daniel Goa In the 2009 provincial elections, the party won 9 seats in the Congress of New Caledonia and around 11.65% of the vote. However, in the South Province, the UC ran on a common slate with Palika and won one of the four seats won by that list. The UC controls the provincial presidency of the Loyalty Islands. Ideology The UC favour the concept of independence- association similar to the Marshall Islands. However, the UC has taken a radical stance in favour of strict adherence to the terms of the Noum√©a Accord, no talks with the loyalists. For example, the UC boycotted the visit of Jacques Chirac to the island in 2003.

In the 1999 elections, the new party obtained 4 seats in the Congress of New Caledonia and formed a common group with the anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR). While still in favour of independence, it supports talks and co-operation between factions in the meantime and opposes the concept of ethnic nationalism and ethnic independence supported by the FLNKS.

History The LKS was founded by a split in the Party of Kanak Liberation (Palika) in 1981. The most radical members of Palika, which had been the base of the party since its creation, walked out criticizing the Palika's increasing moderation and increasing links with the metropolitan French Socialist Party (PS). Led by Nido√Øsh Naisseline, a Marxist, it also refused to support Rock Pidjot of the Caledonian Union in the 1981 elections. However, the LKS moderated and it did not participate in the FLNKS-led electoral boycotts in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the party even started co-operating with the anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) in the Loyalty Islands. Thanks to this alliance, Nido√Øsh Naisseline was president of the islands between 1995 and 1999. During this time, the LKS adopted a platform in favour of independence-association and started early negotiations with the loyalists while the FLNKS refused talks until a mining dispute in the North had been settled. The alliance with the RPCR ended in 2004, but the LKS has remained close to anti-independence parties, notably Future Together. In fact, Christiane Gambey, a member of Future Together, is also a member of the LKS.

Atari withdrew largely from the computer market in 1993, and completely in 1995-1996 when Atari merged with JTS and all support for the platform by Atari was dropped. The systems Atari had built became increasingly left behind as newer and faster systems came out. The few dedicated users who were left wanted more processing power to develop more-advanced TOS applications, paving the way for a number of \\"clone\\" machines, such as the 68040-based Milan and the 68060-based Hades, both of which were considerably more powerful than the 68030-based TT and Falcon and the 68000-based ST/STe. These machines support ISA and PCI buses, which make the use of network and graphics cards designed for the PC possible (something no original Atari machines could do). The machines also support tower cases, making it possible to use internal CD drives. A new clone named Phoenix never made it to market in final form. However, the powerful rev. 6 68060 CPU it would use did make it into a new accelerator board for the Falcon, the CT60/CT63 series, which meant that, for the first time, the Atari platform had a CPU rated at over 100 MHz. The use of a high-speed bus and PC133 RAM also accounted for a big performance improvement and significantly increased the Falcon's on-board memory limit from 14 MiB to 512 MiB with a CT60. These systems were not mass-produced and are now hard to find. While the CT60/CT63 needs a Falcon ‚Äúdonor‚Äù system, and is still not as powerful as the ACP potential system could be, the ACP will use a completely new design, moving away from 68K CPUs to the newer ColdFire class, more powerful than even the fastest 68K chips while still having a largely similar (but not completely compatible) instruction set. It will also allow for the integration of many I/O ports that are currently only available through extensive hardware modification on the Atari platform.  Specifications  The specifications for the ACP have changed considerably over time, in response to advancing technology and price considerations.

The Aishihik Road (pronounced aysh- ee-ack) is an 84-mile road from the Alaska Highway at Canyon Creek (historic mile 996) to the former airfield of Aishihik at the north end of Aishihik Lake. The airfield was part of the Northwest Staging Route, but was effectively abandoned in 1968. Since then, the Yukon government only maintains the first 27 miles of road, which serves two campgrounds and the Aishihik Lake hydroelectric station. The Champagne-Aishihik First Nation (CAFN) has an aboriginal interest in Aishihik and uses the location for traditional gatherings; it has used the site to host a gathering of the Council of Yukon First Nations when the rotation among member first nations took the gathering to the CAFN. The Annie Lake Road is an 18-mile road in Mount Lorne hamlet that services residential areas, plus a golf course. During the 1980s, the Skukum Gold Mine made use of the road to connect across the Wheaton River to its gold mining operations. The Snag Road is a primitive but driveable road that starts from the Alaska Highway south of Beaver Creek, leading approximately 15 miles to the former location of Snag, Yukon. Until 1968, Snag was a military airfield, established as part of the Northwest Staging Route, and the weather station here recorded, on February 3, 1947, the coldest official temperature in North America: 81 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit (-62.8 degrees Celsius). The personnel at the station could also hear conversations at the First Nations (Indian) village just about three miles away. Until the 1970s, the Canadian customs station for Beaver Creek was still called Snag, at a time when the customs station was in the middle of Beaver Creek. Some travelers who missed the customs station, and who the police did not catch up to, traveled up the Snag Road looking for the customs station! The Ross River Access Road connects Ross River with the Robert Campbell Highway, an approximate nine-mile road that replaces a poorer six-mile section of the Canol Road. The Kusawa Lake Road, starting at historical mile 960 of the Alaska Highway, provides access to campgrounds on Kusawa Lake as well as a small number of area residents. The Old Alaska Highway at Champagne served as part of the main highway until fall 2002. It remains open to provide access to Champagne and a traditional campsite. The Bonanza Creek Road and the Hunker Creek Road in the historic Klondike mining district provide access to privately operated mines and some private homes in the Hunker Creek area. These roads are built to minimal standards, and the course of the Bonanza Creek road has been shifted in recent years to accommodate mining operations.

The text reads, \\"It was here in M√ºrren that Arnold Lunn set the first slalom in 1922 and organised the first world championship in downhill and slalom racing in 1931.\\" Sir Arnold Henry Moore Lunn (18 April 1888 - 2 June 1974) was a skier, mountaineer and writer. He was knighted for \\"services to British Skiing and Anglo-Swiss relations\\" in 1952. His father was a lay Methodist minister, but Lunn was an agnostic and wrote critically about Catholicism before he converted to that religion at the age of 45 and became an apologist. He was born in Madras, IndiaWho's Who 1945. London: Adam & Charles Black, p. 1688, where there is a very large entry for Lunn. and died in London aged 86. Early life Arnold Lunn's father, Sir Henry Simpson Lunn (1859‚Äì1939), was firstly a Methodist minister and later founder of Lunn's Travel agency (that would become Lunn Poly), which encouraged tourism in the Swiss Alps. Arnold Lunn's brother, Hugh Kingsmill Lunn, became a noted literary journalist under the name Hugh Kingsmill. Lunn attended Orley Farm School, in Harrow, followed by Harrow School. He studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and while he was there, founded and was sometime President of the Oxford University Mountaineering Club. Skiing Introduced to skiing by his father, he invented the slalom skiing race in 1922. Mathias Zdarsky had been running competitions through poles in the early years of the 20th century, but they were essentially style competitions, though they had to be completed within a specified time. In 1921 Lunn organized the first British national ski championship to include a national slalom race as well as jumping and cross-country. The 1921 slalom was decided on style, as Zdarsky's pole race had been.Hussey, Elisabeth. \\"The Man Who Changed the Face of Alpine Skiing\\", Skiing Heritage, December 2005, p. 9. By 1922, however, Lunn, convinced that there was a real need for a race designed to test a skier's ability to turn securely and rapidly on steep Alpine ground,Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 41. was insisting on speed being the only arbiter. \\"The object of a turn is to get round a given obstacle losing as little speed as possible,\\" he wrote. \\"Therefore, a fast ugly turn is better than a slow pretty turn.\\" On 1 January 1922, the Alpine Ski Challenge Cup, first held in 1920, was transformed into a challenge cup for slalom racing. On the practice slopes at M√ºrren, Lunn set pairs of flags through which the competitors had to turn, and the flags were so set as to test the main varieties of Alpine ski turns. Lunn's innovation was that the winner was simply the competitor who could make his way down in the shortest time. This first slalom was won by J. A. Joannides. Lunn was the founder of the Alpine Ski Club (1908), the Ladies Ski Club (1923)History of the Ladies Ski Club , Ladies Ski Club, 1 May 2017 and the Kandahar Ski Club (1924), and he was the organizer of many ski races around the world. He initiated in collaboration with the Austrian skier Hannes Schneider the Arlberg Kandahar Challenge Cup in honour of Lord Roberts of Kandahar. Through his efforts, the Downhill and Slalom races were introduced into the Olympic Games in 1936, although he opposed the Winter Olympic Games of that year being held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. He later wrote, \\"In 1936 the Olympic Committee paid Hitler the greatest compliment in their power by entrusting the Nazis with the organisation of the summer and winter Olympic Games.\\"Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 64. Lunn refereed the slalom in the 1936 Winter Olympics, and his son, Peter, was the captain of the British ski team, but neither marched in the opening procession or attended the lavish banquet organised by the Nazis. A double-black diamond trail at Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico is named for Sir Arnold Lunn. He was a long-standing member of the Committee of the International Ski Federation. Agnostic years Lunn was the son of a Methodist lay preacher, but in his book Now I See (1933) he writes that the religious instruction he received at school was so \\"woolly\\" that \\"I was never a Methodist, nor, for that matter, an Anglican, in any proper sense of the term.\\" As a result, when he read Leslie Stephen's An Agnostic's Apology, \\"I found myself defenceless ‚Äî thanks to the miserable deficiency of Anglican education ‚Äî against his onslaughts.\\" Lunn became an agnostic. In 1924 he published Roman Converts, which consisted of highly critical studies of five eminent converts to Roman Catholicism: John Henry Newman, Henry Edward Manning, George Tyrell, Gilbert Keith Chesterton and Ronald Knox. Critique of scientific materialism At the same time, Lunn, who was, in Evelyn Waugh's words, \\"restlessly reasonable\\",Waugh, Evelyn (1959). The Life of Ronald Knox. London: Fontana Books, 1962, p. 204. was becoming increasingly disconcerted by the intense subjectivism of his age, and in particular by what he saw as the abandonment of reason in the realm of popular science (though not of science itself). He saw this as deriving from the philosophy of scientific materialism -- the (extra-scientific) assumption that science points inevitably to materialism and that everything can be explained solely in terms of material processes. (Today the philosophical stance he critiqued would be called metaphysical naturalism.) In 1930 Lunn published The Flight from Reason, in which he argued that scientific materialism is finally a philosophy of nihilism: it ends by questioning the very basis of its own existence. If materialism be true, Lunn argued, our thoughts are the mere product of material processes uninfluenced by reason. They are, therefore, determined by irrational processes, and the thoughts which lead to the conclusion that materialism is true have no basis in reason.Schmude, Karl D. (1976). Mountaineer of Faith: Sir Arnold Lunn . A.C.T.S. pamphlet, No. 1681. Conversion to Roman Catholicism In the same year as The Flight from Reason appeared (1930), Lunn proposed to Knox an exchange of letters for subsequent publication in which he would advance all the objections he could conceive of to Roman Catholicism and Knox would reply. Knox accepted, and for more than a year the letters went to and fro. In 1932 they appeared as a book under the title Difficulties. This exchange did much to clarify Lunn's mind, but even so, nearly two years were to elapse before he was received into the Catholic Church. In 1932 Lunn accepted a challenge from the noted philosopher C. E. M. Joad to discuss Christianity in a series of letters; they were published the following year as Is Christianity True? Joad, an agnostic, attacked Christianity on a wide variety of fronts, and Lunn, by now a believing Christian, if uncommitted to any particular denomination, responded. Lunn later wrote: \\"I can imagine no better training for the Church than to spend, as I did, a year arguing the case against Catholicism with a Catholic, and a second year in defending the Catholic position against an agnostic.\\" On 13 July 1933, Mgr Knox received Lunn into the Catholic Church. Lunn's story of his conversion is related in Now I See, which was published in November of the same year. Lunn became, in Evelyn Waugh's words, \\"the most tireless Catholic apologist of his generation,\\" and won the applause of fellow Catholic authors like Hilaire Belloc. Political views During the Spanish Civil War, Lunn became a dedicated supporter of the Nationalist side; he wrote many anti- Republican articles for the British press, and was a member of the pro-Franco group Friends of National Spain.Hoskins, Katerine Bail, Today the struggle: literature and politics in England during the Spanish Civil War. University of Texas Press, 1969. (p. 17) Lunn visited the Nationalist lines during the war and interviewed the Spanish General Gonzalo de Aguilera Munro; Lunn praised Aguilera as \\"not only a soldier but a scholar\\".Herbert R. Southworth, Guernica! Guernica!. University of California Press, 1977. (p. 51). Lunn was also a supporter of Benito Mussolini, stating in a 1938 speech that Mussolini's Fascism \\"has no sense of bullying\\" and that life in Mussolini's Italy was \\"largely the same\\" as it was before Mussolini took power. \\"Says Life in Italy not Like Germany: British Lecturer Condemns Nazism but Likes System Under Mussolini\\". The Montreal Gazette, 28 November 1938, pg. 13. Lunn was opposed to Nazism for \\"its excesses\\", but lauded Neville Chamberlain for his signing of the Munich Agreement, saying Chamberlain did \\"a splendid job\\". Lunn later became a friend of William F. Buckley, Jr. and a contributor to Buckley's National Review. Lunn's writings for the publication were marked by strong anti-communist sentiments.Patrick Allitt, Catholic Converts:British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome.Cornell University Press, 2000 (pp. 208, 236). Marriages Towards the end of 1913 Lunn married Mabel Northcote, the granddaughter of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. They had three children, Peter, John and Jaqueta. Though not keen on mountaineering, Mabel shared her husband's love of skiing. She was the first woman to pass the British First Class skiing test, and she was a founder member of the Kandahar Ski Club.Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 47. When her brother became 3rd Earl of Iddesleigh in 1927, she acquired the courtesy title of \\"Lady Mabel\\". Her husband wrote: \\"In the aristocracy of M√ºrren she welcomed this modest reminder of the fact that inventing the Slalom was not the only Lunn claim to respect.\\" The Swiss, however, could never understand how Arnold could be \\"Mr. Lunn\\" and his wife \\"Lady Mabel\\", and their feelings were aptly conveyed by a member of the Kandahar who congratulated him when he was knighted \\"on making an honest Lady out of Mabel.\\"Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, pp. 50-51. Peter Lunn later became a noted British spymaster. \\"Mabel,\\" Lunn wrote, \\"was invincibly English and I was much consoled during the dark days of 1940 by the fact that her confidence in final victory was never shaken.\\" Lunn once said something nice to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel. \\"I want Jaqueta to feel,\\" she said, \\"that the only thing which calls for comment in war time is cowardice.\\"Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 49. Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: \\"Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but I never expected her to follow our example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of England.\\"Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 51. An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church. \\"I asked you,\\" he said, \\"because you have never written anything unpleasant about Anglicanism since you became a Roman Catholic.\\" But Lunn could never have written \\"anything unpleasant\\" about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, \\"Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic.\\" Lady Mabel Lunn died on 4 March 1959.Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 52. Two years later, on 18 April 1961, Lunn married Phyllis Holt-Needham. In the early 1930s, Lunn was on the point of advertising for a secretary when his wife told him that she had found the perfect secretary for him, the niece of a friend of hers. As his wife had made up her mind, all that remained was for Lunn to demonstrate his \\"manly independence by a formal interview before engaging her candidate for the job.\\" Two days later \\"a rather shy-looking young woman\\" was ushered into his office, Phyllis Holt-Needham. An account of the interview is given in Lunn's book Memory to Memory. At the time Lunn was exchanging controversial letters with J. B. S. Haldane, published later under the title Science and the Supernatural. Phyllis, who was an agnostic and very familiar with modern attacks on Christianity, confidently expected that Haldane would demolish Lunn, and was \\"both surprised and annoyed\\" by his inability to do so. Her first reaction was to find fault with Haldane as a controversialist and to be \\"unduly complimentary\\" about Lunn's controversial talents. Gradually, however, she began to suspect that it was the weakness of Haldane's case which enabled Lunn to get the better of his \\"intellectual superior,\\" and this was the first step in her return to the Christian faith.Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, pp. 114-115. Although Phyllis was only mildly keen on skiing and never an accomplished practitioner, she was Assistant Editor to Lunn of the British Ski Year Book. In recognition, the Club elected her an Honorary Member. Not long before his first wife died, Lunn wrote, she \\"confided to a friend that if anything ever happened to her, Phyllis would take me on, and few second marriages have been so warmly welcomed by the husband's children and friends, and for less obvious reasons by the husband's hostesses.\\"Lunn, Arnold. Unkilled for So Long. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1968, p. 116.

The group emerged in the wake of the pub rock and punk scenes that had been very predominant on the UK capital's live music circuit during the late '70s/ early '80s. The band, a classic power trio, was active between 1983 and 1990 and released three major label LPs. They toured extensively throughout Europe, North America and Australasia, garnering wide critical acclaim for their aggressive blend of rhythm and blues, punk and rockabilly.  History  = Early years = Before founding the Screaming Blue Messiahs, its three members had played together as The Small Brothers. Thompson and Carter had been part of the Captain Beefheart- influenced band Motor Boys Motor; together with Tony Moon on vocals, they recorded several tracks under that name on 24 August 1981 for John Peel's show on BBC Radio 1 and released a self-titled album.Interview with Tony Moon, 1981, No Class Fanzine Initially, after Harris joined Carter and Thompson, the band briefly continued to perform under the name 'Motor Boys Motor'. According to Carter, the final name was chosen upon the suggestion of Ace/Big Beat's Ted Caroll, who was concerned that the band's initial proposal of 'The Blues Messiahs' sounded too pub rock.Liner notes, The Screaming Blue Messiahs ‚Äì Live at the BBC (Hux Records, 2009) Carter employed a rhythmic, blues-influenced, feedback-laden guitar style, using mainly Fender Telecaster guitars together with two combo amps: a Mesa Boogie and an HH outfitted with Gauss speakers. For his occasional forays into slide, he favoured 'the mike stand, or whatever is handy',\\"Guitar Player\\" Magazine, September 1988, reproduced at \\"Blue Heaven\\" and that he only used open tunings 'when the strings go open by accident'. Featuring a sound described as \\"rockabilly from hell\\" and a strong passion for Americana, cars, guns, aeroplanes and broadcast evangelism, the group released the mini-album Good and Gone on Big Beat Records. Its six songs, which had been selected from eleven songs recorded in spring 1984 with producer Vic Maile during a session at Elephant Studios in Wapping, London, included a version of Hank Williams' \\"You're Gonna Change\\". Upon its release, the EP entered the top twenty in the UK independent record chart, where it remained for six months. The Screaming Blue Messiahs played their first official gig at 'Downstairs at the Clarendon', Hammersmith, London on 11 June 1984.Gig history, The Screaming Blue Messiahs, reproduced at \\"Blue Heaven\\" On 24 July 1984, they performed the songs \\"Good And Gone\\", \\"Someone To Talk To\\", \\"Tracking The Dog\\" and \\"Let's Go Down to the Woods And Pray\\" during their first recorded session for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1. Broadcast on 2 August, the session proved so popular that it resulted in two BBC releases, one a 4-track 12\\" and a later inclusion of 'Good And Gone' on an album sampler of Peel Sessions. In December of the same year, The Screaming Blue Messiahs appeared on The Old Grey Whistle Test on the BBC, playing two live songs: \\"Let's Go Down to the Woods And Pray\\" and \\"Good And Gone\\", and then undertook a short tour of the Netherlands. = Major label signing = In January 1985, the band signed to WEA.History of Screaming Blue Messiahs, reproduced at \\"Blue Heaven\\" The label re-released the mini-album Good and Gone, and the band began work on Gun Shy, their first full-length studio album, produced by Vic Maile. On 30 March 1985, BBC radio broadcast a live gig at the Paris Theatre in London. On 14 June, the Messiahs played their second BBC session, performing live versions of \\"Good and Gone\\", \\"Tracking the Dog\\" and \\"Talking Doll\\" for Andy Kershaw's show. In addition, the band extensively toured the UK, Finland, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany that year. The track 'Twin Cadillac Valentine\\", having been influenced from the Spencer Davis Group song \\"Strong Love\\", was released as the first single from Gun Shy in the autumn of 1985. Commenting on the song, Carter has said, \\"When we first went in the studio we didn't have anything, just the backing track. I was trying to get Kenny to play like on \\"I Can See For Miles\\". It's about girls...cars...love, attempted kidnapping and wide open spaces.\\" The release of Gun-Shy in early 1986 was met by a generally positive reception by select music press: Melody Maker stated, \\"[t]hey have a gut instinct for the roots of blues and R 'n' B and from that sure base they can confidently blast their way through Bill Carter's extraordinarily powerful selection of songs\\". The NME opined that, \\"[o]n the strength of this album, I'd say the Messiahs are going to be very, very big indeed.\\" To promote the album, the band embarked on another extensive tour of Germany, Finland, UK, USA‚Äîincluding a series of concerts supporting The Cramps‚ÄîAustralia and New Zealand. Two further singles, \\"Smash The Market Place\\" and \\"Wild Blue Yonder\\", were released from Gun-Shy in 1986. \\"Wild Blue Yonder\\" resurfaced in 2006 as the closing music of season 03, episode 04 of FX's Rescue Me. Their second album, Bikini Red, was recorded over several months in studios around London and released in 1987. Produced by Maile, the record included songwriting contributions from Tony Moon. The first two singles released from the album were \\"I Can Speak American\\" and the title track. The band returned to the BBC in November 1987 and recorded versions of \\"Sweet Water Pools\\", \\"I Wanna Be a Flintstone\\" and \\"Big Brother Muscle\\" from the Bikini Red LP for the Janice Long programme. = Critical acclaim = Jim Betteridge commented in International Musician magazine on Carter's playing style, saying that \\"[h]e plays without a pick, crashing the flesh of his fingers into the strings with little regard for its mortality. Blood can often be seen splattered across the scratch plate ‚Äì or the place where the scratch plate would be if it hadn't been removed. To avoid completely razoring the top of his fingers off, and I suppose also because he likes the sound, William uses unusually heavy bottom strings; Rotosound (and nothing else will do) 56, 48, 28, 16, 13 and 12. But he gives 'em such a sound thrashing that one string breaks every couple of numbers and often one a number, and I don't just mean the top strings; Es and As cop it an' all. In the words of his roadie, 'He goes fooking bonkers!'\\"Jim Betteridge, \\"International Musician\\" Magazine, reproduced at \\"Blue Heaven\\" Carter's vocal delivery also attracted attention in the music press with, for example, John Dougan commenting: \\"Carter wielded his instrument like a cross between Wilko Johnson and Pete Townshend; he was a deft soloist, but it was his tricky, complex rhythm playing that gave the band sheet-after-sheet of supercharged sound for a foundation. As impressive as his guitar playing was his voice: at times comically bawling, other times mumbling and imperceptible; in the course of a verse, Carter could sound righteously indignant, or suddenly frightened and confused\\".[ The Screaming Blue Messiahs, biography, John Dougan, All Music Guide] The band's overall sound, according to Dougan, \\"made for extreme, confrontational, and very, very exciting rock & roll\\". On the edition of 20 March 1987 of the Channel 4 TV show The Tube, David Bowie announced that his favourite band of the moment was The Screaming Blue Messiahs. An avid fan of the group, Bowie reaffirmed his affection for the group on other occasions, for example, in the August '87 issue of Musician magazine: \\"Well! The band this week ‚Äì I've only just discovered them, so they're my pet project ‚Äì is The Screaming Blue Messiahs. They're the best band I've heard out of England in a long time\\", and when asked by Rolling Stone magazine in 1987 who his favourite band was, Bowie replied \\"The Screaming Blue Messiahs. I love them. I think they're terrific.\\"; and again in Words & Music magazine in January 1988: \\"There‚Äôs an English band I like very much. Nobody seems to have heard of them. They‚Äôre called The Screaming Blue Messiahs and I‚Äôm pushing them like mad. I think they‚Äôre really good. There‚Äôs an element of The Clash in them that I really like. But there's something else there. I'm not really sure what it is. There's an exciting guitar player. He's a sort of new wave guitar player, but they're an angry mob from London.\\" The admiration extended to an invitation for the Messiahs to join Bowie on a couple of his Glass Spider Tour dates in the UK. They supported at Cardiff Arms Park in Wales and Roker Park in Sunderland on the 21 and 23 June 1987. = Chart success = January 1988 saw the release of \\"I Wanna Be A Flintstone\\", a reworked song from the Motor Boys Motor album, as a single. The record became an instant hit, peaking at number 28 in the UK charts. The song's success saw the band appearing on the BBC's Top of the Pops and Saturday morning kids' show No. 73. Two videos were made for the song, both making use of cartoon clips from the Flintstones TV series. The single appeared in multiple formats, including picture discs and extended 12\\" remix versions. The song became the group's only charting song in Australia, where it peaked at number 100 in April 1988. Coinciding with their increased popularity due to \\"I Wanna Be A Flintstone\\", the band again toured extensively. In February 1988, the group played concerts in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany. In March they returned to the USA for an extended tour, supporting Echo & The Bunnymen. In April they toured further throughout the US, and late in the year visited Finland and played a few gigs in their native Britain. Commenting on the characteristic intensity of the band's stage performance at this time, Jon Pareles stated that \\"although most rockers like to think their music carries a sense of danger, few bands come closer to raw mayhem than the Screaming Blue Messiahs.\\"Jon Pareles, (14 April 1988). 'Review/Rock; Mayhem by the Screaming Messiahs', New York Times Despite having achieved critical acclaim and a hit record, a change of manager and a long touring schedule coupled with financial hardships after returning from tours began to take a toll on the band. To cope with the intensity of the band's live performances, Carter explained that \\"I used to have to prepare myself all day ahead of the gig for the sheer emotional and physical onslaught. I used to put everything into the gigs. I'd come off stage all used up. I was so hot after, I would have to put ice on my head! Then we'd come back from touring and I'd have to sell guitars in order to live\\". This sentiment was shared by Thompson, \\"One minute I'd be signing autographs in Hollywood then I'd be back here painting skirting boards\\". = Final album = Their third album, Totally Religious ‚Äî jointly produced by Howard Gray and Robert Stevens ‚Äî was recorded in Miami Sound Studios and Criteria Studios in Miami, Alaska Studios in Waterloo, London and Sheffield Recording in Phoenix, Maryland and released in 1989. To support the album's release, the Messiahs toured the UK in November, and in December played six concerts in Germany. A promo video for the track \\"Four Engines Burning\\" was shot, although no singles were released from the album. The group's relationship with its record label deteriorated, resulting in the removal of \\"Totally Religious\\" from distribution a month after its release. The band was dropped from its contract, and split up shortly afterwards, playing their last gig at The Subterrania Club in Notting Hill, London, on 5 June 1990. The group's recordings were subsequently deleted from the WEA and Elektra catalogues and became unavailable. Post break-up Following the split, Thompson and Harris played with Cajun outfit La Rue. They then reunited with Tony Moon and bass player Ricky McGuire from The Men They Couldn't Hang to form Dynamo Hum and released a 10\\" EP entitled \\"Four Cute Creatures\\". Kenny Harris went on to play with The Men They Couldn't Hang, followed by spells as a house husband, a baker and a published author. In 1990, The Replacements released their album All Shook Down. Unbeknownst to them, the Messiahs had released a single with the same title two years earlier. Upon learning this, Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg tried unsuccessfully to delay the release of the record to change the title. In 1994, \\"I Wanna Be A Flintstone\\" was included on the soundtrack to the US version of the film The Flintstones. In 1997 Dave 'Chalkie' Dawson, friend and photographer of the band in their early days, put together an official Screaming Blue Messiahs website at www.screamingbluemessiahs.co.uk As of 2010, Bill Carter's musical output since the split has been limited to a few demos posted briefly on his MySpace website. Carter also returned to art, producing screen prints and digital work, exhibiting at the Jenny Granger Gallery and Kessaris Art. The only new official Messiahs material to surface since 1989 has been the 1992 BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert CD, recorded at The Town & Country Club in London on 27 February 1988, and a home-produced live album of a show in Zurich, released in 2007. In 2009, Hux Records released an album titled The Screaming Blue Messiahs ‚Äì Live at the BBC featuring live recordings of the band performing at the Paris Theatre in London in 1985 and BBC radio sessions recorded for the Andy Kershaw and Janice Long radio programmes in 1985 and 1987, respectively. In 2009, Wounded Bird Records reissued the albums Gun Shy and Bikini Red, which had been unavailable since the early 1990s. In April 2009, Chris Thompson gave an interview with Chicago-based music website Consequence of Sound during which, when asked about the possibility of The Screaming Blue Messiahs reforming, he commented: \\"Every couple of years I get a call from one of the others saying, \\"Shall we re-form and do something\\". I have always said, \\"OK let's go!\\" Then after about a week it fizzles out with some sort of drama. I had my bi-annual call recently. This time I said I wasn‚Äôt up for it as it‚Äôs just going to fizzle out in a week. Anyway, I‚Äôm having a lot of fun doing what I‚Äôm doing. But as they say, \\"Never say Never\\".\\"Interview with Chris Thompson (of The Screaming Blue Messiahs), Consequence of Sound, 7 April 2009 In July 2010, Thompson's band The Killer B's released an album titled Love is a Cadillac, Death is a Ford on Track Records. It also featured former Messiahs drummer Kenny Harris and former collaborator Tony Moon. In November 2012, Chris Thompson and Kenny Harris recorded three tracks with Pat Collier at Perry Vale Studios, London, under the name of Horseface, with plans for further recording and gigs in 2013. The three tracks were made available for listening on SoundCloud. In May 2017, Greg Gutfeld of Fox News interviewed Bill Carter for his Podcast \\"The One w/ Greg Gutfeld\\".

Although the band experienced little chart success, their single \\"More to Lose\\" went on to become a teen anthem in the Philippines. History While studying at University College London, Ricky Gervais and his friend Bill Macrae formed Seona Dancing, with Macrae writing the music and playing keyboards, and Gervais writing and singing the lyrics. After recording a sixteen-song demo tape, they were signed by London Records which released two of their singles: \\"More to Lose\\" and \\"Bitter Heart\\". In June 1983, the duo performed their single \\"More to Lose\\" on the ITV syndicated children's television show Razzmatazz. Yet, despite the promotion of \\"Bitter Heart\\" through its music video and \\"More to Lose\\" by its TV performance, both singles failed to break the Top 40, with \\"More to Lose\\" charting at number 117 and \\"Bitter Heart\\" at number 79 on the UK Singles Chart.Johnny Davis, The Independent, 2005, \\"Ricky Gervais: My life as a superstar\\" ‚Äì retrieved on 2009-09-12 After the lacklustre performance of their two singles, the band split up in 1984. Gervais went on to have a successful international career as a comedian and actor. When Jimmy Kimmel asked about Macrae in a 2014 interview, Gervais said, \\"I hope he got fat, too.\\" Popularity in the Philippines In 1985, DWRT-FM (then known as 99.5 RT, now 99.5 Play FM), a radio station in Metro Manila, Philippines, started playing a song billed as \\"Fade\\" by Medium (also billed as \\"Medium\\" by Fade). DWRT-FM deliberately misnamed the artist and song title to prevent anyone from finding the record and playing it themselves. Additionally, to stop other radio stations from recording it and playing it, DWRT-FM inserted a station ID midway through the track. A year later, another radio station, DWXB-102, revealed the true identity of the song as \\"More to Lose\\" by Seona Dancing. The song, which utilises an opening piano riff to convey the sound of falling teardrops, became a major radio and club hit as well as a favourite at high-school dances during the 1980s and beyond. AllMusic critic Michael Sutton wrote that the track was \\"the theme song of angst-ridden New Wave youths in the Philippines\\" and \\"an '80s anthem as ubiquitous as Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes', but with the eternal hipster cool of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'.\\" Discography *1983: \\"More to Lose\\" b/w \\"You're on My Side\\" (7\\", 12\\" single) ‚Äì UK No. 117 *1983: \\"Bitter Heart\\" b/w \\"Tell Her\\" (7\\", 12\\") ‚Äì UK No. 79\\"Seona Dancing\\", Chart Stats, retrieved 2011-01-15 An unofficial CD compiling of all of the band's songs (apart from the 7\\" versions of \\"Bitter Heart\\" and \\"Tell Her\\"), titled More to Lose, was released in 2005.

He resigned from the Upper House to run again for the House of Commons of Canada in an 1881 by-election and was returned to parliament as a Conservative. McLelan served from 10 December 1885-26 January 1887 as the Minister of Finance in the second administration of Sir John A. Macdonald. In 1842, he married Caroline Metzler.

Family The son of Sir Edward Seymour, 5th Baronet, of Berry Pomeroy, a descendant of Lord Protector Somerset by his first marriage, to Catherine Fillol, Edward Seymour was baptised at Easton Royal, Wiltshire, on 17 January 1694.Easton Royal History at pewswan.org.uk On 8 March 1716 or 5 March 1717, at Monkton Farleigh, Edward Seymour married Mary Webb (born at Seend on 22 October 1697, died 1 February 1768, and buried at Seend), a daughter of Daniel Webb, of Monkton Farleigh, and wife Elizabeth Somner, daughter of John Somner, of Seend. They had at least five children. Inheritance and titles In December 1740, his father died and Seymour inherited his manors in Wiltshire and Devon. On 11 September 1744, with the unexpected death of George Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp (1725‚Äì1744), the only son of Algernon Seymour, Earl of Hertford, himself son and heir of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, the likelihood emerged of Seymour succeeding his distant cousin as Duke of Somerset and Baron Seymour, as the future 7th Duke was then aged sixty, and his wife was past child- bearing age. On 23 November 1750 the Duke died, and Seymour duly succeeded to his titles.The Complete Peerage vol. XII pI, pp. 82-83. However, he inherited little of the great wealth enjoyed by his two immediate predecessors, as the 7th Duke had arranged for the principal Percy family estates and houses of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland House, Petworth House, and Syon House to be divided between his daughter Elizabeth and his nephew Charles Wyndham. As a result, the Dukes of Somerset were never again among the greatest landowning families.

Crumlin () is a Southside suburb of Dublin, Ireland. A densely populated residential area, with some industry, it is also the site of Ireland's largest children's hospital. Location Crumlin covers the area from the River Poddle near the KCR (Kimmage Cross Roads) to Sundrive Road and Crumlin Cross at The Submarine Bar to Crumlin's village core and the Drimnagh Road, to Bunting Road, Crumlin Road then along the Grand Canal from Rialto Bridge to Sally's Bridge. It is situated near to the city centre, on the Southside of Dublin city. Neighbouring areas include Walkinstown, Perrystown, Drimnagh, Terenure, and Kimmage. Crumlin is contained within postal district Dublin 12. Name Crumlin gets its name from the crooked valley known as Lansdowne Valley. The valley was formed by glacial erosion in the distant past and is now bisected by the River Camac. The valley, depending on your point of view, is situated in front of or behind Drimnagh and is largely made up of good-quality houses with plentiful recreational parkland. History During the medieval period, Dublin was surrounded by manorial settlements comprising church, graveyard, manor house, motte and bailey, farms and cottages. These settlements grew into a network of villages around Dublin creating stability and continuity of location. Crumlin Village developed as an Anglo-Norman settlement soon after the Norman Conquest in 1170, (although the circular configuration of the old graveyard of Saint Mary‚Äôs in the village suggests pre-Norman associations), and has survived through the centuries to become the village of today. The Old Saint Mary's Church stands on the site of a 12th-century church of the same dedication, and a succession of churches occupied the site down through the centuries to the present day. In 1193, King John (the then Prince of Moreton) gave the Crumlin church to form one prebend in the collegiate church of Saint Patrick. When the main body of the present old church was rebuilt in 1817, the old tower of a much earlier origin was preserved. Crumlin, along with Saggart, Newcastle, Lyons and Esker (Lucan) was constituted a royal manor by King John sometime before the end of his reign in 1216. The English noble families of the time had strong links with Ireland, particularly in Leinster. For example, William Fitz John of HarptreeModern East Harptree and West Harptree. was a lord of some significance in Somerset and likely to have served in Ireland under King John. At the beginning of the reign of King Henry III, Fitz John acquired the custody of the lands of William de Carew and held the royal manor of Crumlin, although he did not establish family roots in Ireland.Ireland and Britain, 1170-1450 - Robin Frame 1998. , 9780826445445The History of the County of Dublin. John D'Alton. Hodges and Smith, 1838. Digitised by Google 22 Jun 2006 As the church was the nucleus of life on the manor in medieval times, we may with confidence place the centre of Crumlin‚Äôs medieval settlement in the area of Crumlin Village. This has been confirmed by recent archaeological excavations in the area of Saint Mary‚Äôsand the site of the former motte and earthworks on which the new St. Mary's Church was built. St. Mary's Church, Crumlin Village, Dublin - South East View. Some of the local amenities in Crumlin, such as Pearse College on Clogher Road and Ceannt park, are named after some of the 1916 Rebels who had a training camp in nearby Kimmage at Sundrive crossroads.

Thus, an interlocutory order is not final and is not subject to immediate appeal. In many U.S. legal systems, interlocutory orders are not appealable, save for in a few extraordinary cases. Interlocutory orders are orders that are issued by a court while a case is still ongoing. These orders are not meant to be final.

However, in other legal systems, such as in England and Wales, in Hong Kong, and in Canada, interlocutory orders in civil matters can be appealed by leave of the appellate court.

Gameplay Arcade version screenshot Dig Dug II takes place on an island with an overhead view. The goal is to kill all the enemies. There are two types of enemies: Pookas (round red monsters with goggles), which can kill a player by touching him, and Fygars (dragons), which can kill a player either by touching him or breathing fire on him. Taizo Hori (the player's character) is armed with two weapons. One is an air pump that can inflate enemies until they burst. The other is a jackhammer, which can be used at \\"fault lines\\" on the map to create faults in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reach the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean, killing all creatures on it, including Taizo himself if the player is not careful. The points earned from this depend on how many enemies are killed at once. Once three pieces of land have been cut off an island, a bonus vegetable will appear somewhere on what remains of the island, which can be eaten for extra points. When only one, two or (on later rounds) three enemies remain on the island, the enemies will head for the edge of the island and jump into the water, killing themselves and ending the round. Reception While Dig Dug II saw success in its first few months on the market, the game was largely unsuccessful and was not nearly as popular as its predecessor when it was released. The title's departure from the original's maze-chase gameplay, its time of release, and the lack of the original's free movement are believed to have attributed to its failure. A reviewer for the magazine Computer & Video Games said that the game, while having a high difficulty level, was worth playing and became easier through practice. Legacy In 2005, Dig Dug II was ported to the PlayStation Portable as part of Namco Museum Battle Collection, and was included in Namco Museum DS which was released for the Nintendo DS on September 18, 2007. The game was also included in Namco Museum Virtual Arcade in 2008 and was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on October 20, 2009, along with the inceptive title. Both Dig Dug games are available as part of the Namco Museum Megamix compilation for the Wii, which (much unlike the Virtual Console Arcade versions) was only released in North America. A reimagined version for PC titled Dig Dug Island, featuring online multiplayer, was released in 2008 exclusively in Japan. However, the game's servers were shut down in just under a year, leaving it unplayable.

Initially it was exclusively for the Atari Jaguar in North America and Europe on December 21, 1994, and was later released in Japan by Messe Sansao on July 1995. It was the first fighting title to be released for the Jaguar, and unsuccessfully sought to capitalize on the trend of ultra violent fighting games started by Midway's Mortal Kombat in 1992. When the elder ninja Gyaku kills two of his fellow elders through black magic and becomes possessed by a powerful demon after breaking the gate to the underworld, it is up to the player in taking the role from any of the playable characters in order to defeat other opponents before Lord Gyaku destroys the Earth. Being one of the first titles announced for the Jaguar before it was launched to the public in November 1993, Kasumi Ninja was created by the same company who previously developed Dracula the Undead for the Atari Lynx in 1991 and had a troubled development process, undergoing through various changes before release. It was also one of the first games to feature a parental lockout system, allowing censorship and limiting the violence displayed during gameplay. Kasumi Ninja received mixed to negative reception when it was released. While it received praise for its visuals, critics panned the controls, sound and slow gameplay, with many reviewers calling it a Mortal Kombat rip-off. By April 1, 1995, the game has sold more than 24,000 copies though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime and has since been called by some as one of the worst games of all time. A sequel, Kasumi Ninja II, was in development for the Atari Jaguar CD but it was cancelled.  Gameplay  Senzo defeating Alaric after giving a roundhouse kick. Kasumi Ninja is a fighting game featuring digitized graphics and sprites with pseudo-3D battlegrounds using parallax scrolling, in which the player fights against other opponents in one-on-one matches. The fighter who manages to deplete the health bar of the opponent wins the first bout and the first to win two bouts becomes the winner of the match. Each round is timed, which can be adjusted at the options menu screen,Kasumi Ninja game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) and if both fighters still have health remaining when time is over, the one with more health wins that round. The game features four levels of difficulty that can be selected on both the main and options menu screen, while also featuring four levels of gore display to choose from on the options menu, with Gore Fest being the highest and the only mode where characters can trigger their respective death moves, among other settings. The game also features a parental lockout system where parents can censor the level of violence displayed during gameplay by entering a six-digit password with the controller's keypad. In the single-player mode, only two characters are selectable at the beginning, while more characters are unlocked by defeating the computer in a series of one-on-one matches. If the player manages to defeat all of the opponents in the lowest difficulty, the player will not be able to fight against Gyaku but he can be faced on the Normal difficulty, although his demonic form can only be challenged in the higher difficulties. Depending on the difficulty selected, the player is given a number of continues before getting a game over screen. Similar to Mortal Kombat, special and death moves are performed by holding the C button while pressing the d-pad. The game's blocking system also works similarly to Mortal Kombat, in which the player still receives damage when blocking against physical and projectile attacks. A unique feature of the game is the functionality of the health bar during gameplay, which is a katana and spills blood into the battleground when the character gets damaged. The game also features a two- player versus mode.  Synopsis  = Plot = The Kasumi island has spawned some of the most renowned warriors seen in the world, while also remaining hidden from eyes of the modern world within the mist that surrounds it due to Preeminent Celestials, making those who find the place uninvited never being heard from again. Those on the island are trained both in body and spirit at the Dragon Cloud temple by three wise and capable elder ninjas, with each one representing an aspect of humanity and due to the balance of good and evil between them, it allows the gate to the netherworld remain close but one of the eldest ninjas on the island, Gyaku, kills both Hiei and Kaioh, the other two elder ninjas, fracturing the alignment of the cosmic forces and opening the gate to the underworld in the process, resulting in Gyaku becoming possessed by a powerful demon capable of destroying the Earth. As a result, the player takes role of either fighter chosen by the Celestials in order to defeat Lord Gyaku and restore balance to the universe. = Characters = *Habaki and Senzo: Both are twin ninjas from the Kiri-ga-kure family left in care at an early age by the monks at the Dragon Cloud Temple. Both equally adept at the arts, spiritually and physically, the ninja elders noticed their skills and offered them a chance to advance their arts by training as their disciples, with Habaki and Senzo being chosen by Kaioh and Hiei respectively. The two are carbon copies of each other, with the only difference between them being their respective death moves. *Chagi Nelson: A five-time world kickboxing champion who has never lost a professional bout, Chagi has trained all over the world, mixing different martial arts to develop a style all his own. His name is a reference to the Neri Chagi, a taekwondo move. One of his death moves was voted #9 on the \\"GamesMaster Gore Special - Top 10 Death Moves\\", where he grabs and hits his opponent with his knee, then kicks a hole through his opponent's body. *Pakawa: Chief of the Tu-Wee-Kah comanche fighting tribe who have lived in harmony with nature, being equivalent of the Green Berets of their time. *Thundra: Queen of a lost Amazon warriors tribe who have taken a solemn oath to protect rainforests from modern industrialists wishing to destroy them for profit by channeling their inner power to imitate the fury of nature. *Alaric: A renowned fighter and king of the ruthlessly ferocious Goths tribe from Northern Europe. He is loosely based on a real barbarian king also named Alaric who once sacked Rome. Alaric was originally named Eksel in a beta version of the game and his outfit was of a different color, which can be seen in early magazine previews. *Danja Ureda: An assistant DA fighting in court by day and a vigilante by night who quickly learn the laws of the street to survive when growing up. Her look has been described by game reviewers as \\"a prostitute wearing a catsuit\\" and noting her paltry moveset, despite her being a \\"street vigilante\\". *Angus MacGreggor: The blacksmith brawler of his Loch Katrine village in Scotland, as was his father, and his father's father before him. One of his death moves was voted #1 in the \\"GamesMaster Gore Special - Top 10 Death Moves\\", where he rapidly punches his opponent's head, decapitates him with a kick, and headbutts their head offscreen when it's airborne. Angus is most noted for the special move in which he shoots a fireball that inexplicably comes from underneath his kilt. Featuring him among the most bizarre fighting characters in 2008, GameDaily wrote that \\"nowhere else will you find an Scotsman that launches fireballs from beneath his kilt. *Lord Gyaku: The final boss of the game and one of the eldest ninjas, who went berserk and killed all of the other elders on Kasumi island and proclaimed himself as his lord after being possessed by an evil sprit from the Demon World. If the player does not use a death move on Lord Gyaku during the final battle in single player mode, Lord Gyaku will transform into \\"Demon Gyaku\\", a stronger version of himself that resembles a Red Frill Lizard. Defeating his demonic humanoid form will reward players with the \\"Best Ending.\\" It is also possible to play as Gyaku with a cheat code, whereupon he replaces Senzo and Habaki in the Versus Mode. He is also known as Tsuba in the beta version of the game.  Development and release  Originally codenamed Ninja Puncher early in development, Kasumi Ninja was developed by UK-based developer Hand Made Software, who previously developed titles such as Dracula the Undead on the Atari Lynx and became one of the first titles announced for the then-upcoming Jaguar, featuring a completely different visual style compared to the one featured in the final version and was planned to have a roster of 20 playable characters instead of eight. The reason given in regards to the final character roster by former Hand Made Software producer Jim Gregory is due to meddling from Atari Corporation, removing much of the characters and other elements that were previously developed for the title, in addition of reducing memory size for the game cartridge. The game appeared at both Spring ECTS '94 and SCES '94 in a playable state, now sporting digitized graphics and sprites as with the final release. Kasumi Ninja was first released on December 21, 1994 and was later released in Japan by Messe Sansao on July of the next year. Some copies of the game came with a headband accessory branded with the game's logo.  Reception  The game received a mixed-to-negative response from critics. It has been criticized for being a blatant rip-off of Mortal Kombat (including gameplay, digitized graphics and graphic violence) with poor controls. GamePro commented that the graphics are technically impressive, but often unpleasant to look at due to aesthetic choices such as the palette swapped characters, the massive blood drops, and Angus's kilt-lifting move. They also criticized the controls, the music, and the announcer's voice, and concluded \\"Kasumi's a 64-bit warrior destined to remain in the shadows of deeper 16-bit fighting games.\\" Next Generation gave it one star out of five, calling it \\"a tragic example when good ideas are poorly executed\\" and citing \\"jerky animation\\", \\"sluggish control\\" and \\"baffling gameplay mechanics that discourage close-up fighting\\". Conversely, German website Atari Inside scored it 82%, praising the graphics and gameplay but criticizing the animation. ST-Computer also reviewed the game positively, giving a score of 80%, with commendations on graphics but low views on animation. Brazilian magazine SuperGamePower gave the game 3.5 out of 5 for sharp graphics and large move set. French magazine Consoles+ scored the game 73%, approving the original style in performing moves and option to adjust the amount of blood spilling (although a second reviewer criticized the game's slowness, and that the game's quality is more SNES than Jaguar). In a retrospective review, AllGame praised the game's visuals, but criticized the controller and concluded the game to be no more than \\"a horrible cash-in\\" Mortal Kombat clone that \\"should be ignored by all but the most devoted 64-bit Atari Jaguar fans.\\" GamePro summarized that \\"Kasumi Ninja was a terrible, terrible Jaguar title - bad controller, bad controls, terrible menu set, forgettable characters, and an utterly unoriginal premise - that, thankfully, history has forgotten.\\"  Legacy  A sequel, Kasumi Ninja II, was in development for the Atari Jaguar CD after the first game was released but it was cancelled after Atari Corp. closed its doors, making Hand Made Software lose money in the process. In 2009, Topless Robot ranked it as the fourth worst Mortal Kombat rip-off. In 2011, UGO.com included it in their list of the 102 worst games of all time. That same year, Complex called it \\"one of the worst Jaguar games ever released in a sea of awful Jaguar games.\\" In 2012, Complex also ranked it as the fourth worst fighting game of all time, adding, \\"It was hard choosing amongst Ultra Vortek, Fight for Life, and Kasumi Ninja for the worst Jaguar fighting game, but we‚Äôre going to go with the last one mentioned because it‚Äôs probably the most famous. And also the worst.\\" Kasumi Ninja is also listed in Digital Press's \\"50 Awful Games.\\" In a 2017 forum post at AtariAge, community member Chriz-B discovered that the introduction, continue and ending screens of the game were taken from Lake Atitl√°n, Guatemala.

Before acquisition by the Go-Ahead Group in June 2018, the company was known as East Yorkshire Motor Services. In and around Scarborough, services operate under the Scarborough Locals brand, having been formerly branded as Scarborough and District. Additionally, private hire coach services are operated under the name East Yorkshire Coaches. In March 2019, the company unveiled a new corporate livery and logo. History Paragon Interchange, seen in May 2008. Buses outside the depot at Scarborough, seen in May 2009. Buses outside the depot at Hornsea, seen in June 2012. A Finglands Coachways Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Olympian, seen at Piccadilly Gardens in July 2008. East Yorkshire Motor Services was originally made up of two companies, Lee & Beaulah, set up by Ernest John Lee, and Hull & District Motor Services, set up by H.A. Harvey. In 1926, British Electric Traction bought the two companies, forming East Yorkshire Motor Services. In 1968, British Electric Traction was sold to the Transport Holding Company, which in turn, became the National Bus Company in 1969. Until 1972, the livery of East Yorkshire was dark blue and primrose. The livery was then changed to blue and white, in the National Bus Company corporate layout. This proved to be short-lived, with the livery being replaced by National Bus Company poppy red. In the lead up to privatisation in 1987, East Yorkshire's fleet (which had dropped to 200 vehicles, and shared management with Lincolnshire Road Car) started to grow again. United Automobile Services' depots in Scarborough and Pickering were transferred to East Yorkshire, with operations rebranded as Scarborough & District. In February 1987, East Yorkshire was sold in a management buyout, led by seven managers. Following the buyout, East Yorkshire began to expand, acquiring many independent operators in the local area, including Connor & Graham, Cottingham Mini Coaches and Primrose Valley Coaches. The liveries at privatisation were silver and blue, National Bus Company poppy red, and the National Bus Company minibus livery of silver, blue and red. The poppy red buses soon started receiving a red and grey livery. The Hardwick's of Scarborough fleet was purchased from Wallace Arnold (Wallace Arnold's last bus company). In Hull, some AEC Routemaster vehicles entered service in traditional pre-National Bus Company East Yorkshire blue, to compete with Kingston upon Hull City Transport. East Yorkshire suffered competition in Bridlington, Hull and Scarborough from Applebys. In 1999, Applebys closed its Scarborough base, and was subsequently placed in to receivership shortly after. In 2009, East Yorkshire won the coveted Large Bus Operator of the Year award (an award for bus operators running over 100 buses), at a presentation dinner attended by over 600 people from the bus and coach industry. The award event was held by RouteOne, one of the industry's main national trade magazines. The company has also reached the final of the Large Bus Operator of the Year award in subsequent years (2011, 2013 and 2014). =Out-of-area acquisitions= Finglands Coachways East Yorkshire's first out-of-area expansion was in 1992, with the purchase of Finglands Coachways of Rusholme, with the original Stagecoach Manchester operation following in 1995. In August 2013, First announced that subject to regulatory approval by the Office of Fair Trading, it had agreed to purchase the bus operations of Finglands Coachways. The sale included the lease of Finglands's depot in Rusholme, as well as routes, and approximately 100 members of staff, but no vehicles. The deal was approved in January 2014, with First Greater Manchester taking over on operations in February 2014. In October 2013, East Yorkshire sold the Finglands coach charter business to Bullocks Coaches. Whittles Bus & Coach Whittle Bus & Coach of Kidderminster was acquired by East Yorkshire in January 2004. This was the second major out-of-area acquisition for East Yorkshire, since the management buyout in February 1987. The business operated 50 vehicles at the time of purchase, running bus services in predominantly rural areas in the counties of Shropshire and Worcestershire. In December 2014, the Whittles coach business was sold to Johnsons Coach & Bus Travel, along with nine coaches. Following the sale, the operation of National Express contracted services were transferred to other operators, with local bus services being withdrawn entirely in January 2015. =Acquisition by the Go- Ahead Group= In June 2018, East Yorkshire was acquired by Go-Ahead, bringing an end to 30 years of family ownership. East Yorkshire will continue to run as a standalone company within Go North East. In late October 2018, ¬£1 million was invested in new Ticketer smart ticketing machines, with the ability to accept contactless payments. In March 2019, a new livery and corporate branding was announced. The new livery is an evolution of the well known burgundy and cream colour scheme. Under the changes, the trading name for the business became East Yorkshire, with a new typeface, and the white rose of Yorkshire replacing the letter O, to form part of the logo. The new East Yorkshire brand was launched at an event at Hull City Football Club's KCOM Stadium, with two buses displayed in the new livery. East Yorkshire Coaches Coaches are operated for hire, day trips and short holidays, with services running under the East Yorkshire Coaches name. East Yorkshire Coaches also traded as Frodingham Coaches between November 2001 and October 2007, following the purchase of the company. The previous coaching operation, East Yorkshire Travel, was once a nationwide operator, but was sold to the Godfrey Burley Group in 1996. East Yorkshire is also a National Express contractor, operating a number of routes to destinations across the country. Fleet and operations A large part of the East Yorkshire fleet is made up of vehicles manufactured by Alexander Dennis and Volvo. As of December 2016, the fleet consists of 316 buses and coaches. In May 2015, East Yorkshire was the first operator to take delivery of a MCV EvoSeti. Following further deliveries in January and September 2017, an additional 18 vehicles were added to the fleet. A heritage fleet is maintained by East Yorkshire, consisting of a Leyland PD2 open-top, and a Willowbrook bodied AEC Regent. = Depots = As of March 2020, East Yorkshire operate from six bus depots: * Bridlington: Bessingby Way, Bessingby Industrial Estate, Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire *Elloughton: Stockbridge Road, Elloughton, Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire *Hull: Anlaby Road, Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire *Pocklington: Station Road, Pocklington, York, East Riding of Yorkshire *Scarborough: East Yorkshire operate two depots in Scarborough, located at Barry's Lane and Westwood Road. *Withernsea: Bannister Street, Withernsea, East Riding of Yorkshire Acquisitions *1987: Cherry Coaches (Beverley) & Wallace Arnold with Hardwicks (Scarborough) *1988: Phillip's Coaches (Shiptonthorpe) *1992: Finglands Coachways (Manchester), Metro Citybus (Hull), Rhodes Coaches (Wawne) & Thornton Dale Coaches (Pickering) *1993: Connor & Graham (Easington) *1995: Hart Coaches (Stockton on Tees) *1996: Charterplan (from Stagecoach Manchester) & Hollings Coaches (North Shields) *1997: Armstrong Galley (from Stagecoach North East) & Kingstonian Travel Services (from Stagecoach in Hull) *2001: Frodingham Coaches (Driffield) *2004: Whittles Coach & Bus (Kidderminster) *2009: Veolia (operations in Hull) Moorsbus East Yorkshire formerly operated Moorsbus services from the Hull depot, with the two duties usually operating with Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLE vehicles. In 2013, these services were withdrawn, following the withdrawal of funding for Moorsbus services. In early 2014, East Yorkshire registered service ME1, Moors Explorer, which replaced the previous M13 and M14 services running from Hull. The new Moors Explorer ME1 service runs from Hessle, Hull, Cottingham and Beverley to Pickering, Kirkbymoorside and Danby, closely following the old route. The service is being run on a commercial basis by East Yorkshire, and has proved very popular with both local residents, as well as visitors to the North York Moors. Documentary East Yorkshire was the subject of an eight- part documentary series, On The Yorkshire Buses. The documentary originally aired on Channel 5 in July 2014, and was narrated by Simon Farnaby.

It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs). NSSL studies weather radar, tornadoes, flash floods, lightning, damaging winds, hail, and winter weather out of Norman, Oklahoma, using various techniques and tools in their HWT, or Hazardous Weather Testbed. NSSL meteorologists developed the first doppler radar for the purpose of meteorological observation, and contributed to the development of the NEXRAD (WSR-88D). NSSL has a partnership with the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies (CIMMS) at the University of Oklahoma that enables collaboration and participation by students and visiting scientists in performing research. The Lab also works closely with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and the National Weather Service Norman Forecast Office, which are co-located at the National Weather Center (NWC) in Norman, Oklahoma.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory. About NSSL. Retrieved April 30, 2014. The NWC houses a combination of University of Oklahoma, NOAA and state organizations that work in collaboration. History NSSL's first Doppler weather radar, the NSSL Doppler, located in Norman, Oklahoma. 1970s research using this radar led to NWS NEXRAD WSR-88D radar network. The first tornado captured on May 24, 1973, by the NSSL Doppler weather radar and NSSL chase personnel. The tornado is here in its early stage of formation near Union City, OklahomaIn 1962 a research team from the United States Weather Bureau's National Severe Storms Project (NSSP) moved from Kansas City, Missouri to Norman, Oklahoma, where, in 1956, the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory had installed a 3 cm continuous-wave Doppler Weather Surveillance Radar-1957 (WSR-57). This radar was designed to detect very high wind speeds in tornadoes, but could not determine the distance to the tornadoes. In 1963, the Weather Radar Laboratory (WRL) was established in Norman and, in the following year, engineers modified the radar to transmit in pulses. The pulse-Doppler radar could receive data in between each transmit pulse, eliminating the need for two antennas and solving the distance problem.\\"National Severe Storms Laboratory NSSL History\\" In 1964, the remainder of the NSSP moved to Norman, where it merged with WRL and was renamed the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). Dr. Edwin Kessler became the first director. In 1969, NSSL obtained a surplus 10-cm pulse-Doppler radar from the United States Air Force. This radar was used to scan and film the complete life cycle of a tornado in 1973. By comparing the film with velocity images from the radar, the researchers found a pattern that showed the tornado beginning to form before it could be visually detected on the film. The researchers named this phenomenon the Tornado Vortex Signature (TVS). Research using this radar led to the concept that would later go on to become the NWS NEXRAD WSR-88D radar network. In 1973, the Laboratory commissioned a second Doppler weather radar, named the Cimarron radar, located west of Oklahoma City. This enabled NSSL to perform dual Doppler experiments while scanning storms with both radars simultaneously. A deliberate decision to collocate research with operations led the National Severe Storms Forecast Center to move from Kansas City to Norman in 1997, changing its name to the Storm Prediction Center. This move would allow for improved collaborations between NSSL and SPC. Some three years later in 2000, the first NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) Spring Experiment took place. This would become an annual event to evaluate operational and experimental models and algorithms with the NWS.  Organization  NSSL is organized into three primary divisions: * Forecast Research & Development Division * Radar Research & Development Division * Warning Research & Development Division  Forecast Research & Development  = FACETs = Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs) serves as a broad-based framework and strategy to help focus and direct efforts related to next-generation science, technology and tools for forecasting environmental hazards. FACETS will address grid-based probabilistic threats, storm-scale observations and guidance, the forecaster, threat grid tools, useful output, effective response, and verification. = Warn-on-Forecast = The Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) research project aims to deliver a set of technologies for FACETs on a variety of space and time scales. WoF aims to create computer-model projections that accurately predict storm-scale phenomena such as tornadoes, large hail, and extremely localized rainfall. If Warn-on-Forecast is successful, forecasts likely could improve lead time by factors of 2 to 4 times. = NSSL-WRF = The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is the product of a collaboration between the meteorological research and forecasting communities. Working at the interface between research and operations, NSSL scientists have been some of the main contributors to WRF development efforts and continue to provide operational implementation and testing of WRF. The NSSL WRF generates daily, real-time 1- to 36-hour experimental forecasts at a 4 km resolution of precipitation, lightning threat, and more. = WoF Tornado Threat Prediction = WoF Tornado Threat Prediction (WoF-TTP) is a research project to develop a 0‚Äì1 hour, 1-km resolution suite of high detail computer models to forecast individual convective storms and their tornadic potential. Target future average lead- time for tornado warnings via WoF-TTP is 40‚Äì60 minutes. The technology and science developed to achieve the WoF-TTP goal hopes to improve the prediction of other convective weather threats such as large hail and damaging winds. = NME = NSSL's Mesoscale Ensemble (NME) is an experimental analysis and short- range ensemble forecast system. These forecasts are designed to be used by forecasters as a 3-D hourly analysis of the environment. = Q2 = The National Mosaic and Multi-sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (NMQ) system uses a combination of observing systems ranging from radars to satellites on a national scale to produce precipitation forecasts. NMQ's prototype QPE products are also known as ‚ÄúQ2‚Äù - next-generation products combining the most effective multi-sensor techniques to estimate precipitation. = NEXRAD = NSSL scientists helped develop the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars, also known as NEXt- generation RADar (NEXRAD). Since the first Doppler weather radar became operational in Norman in 1974, NSSL has worked to extend its functionality, and proved to the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) that Doppler weather radar was important as a nowcasting tool. The NWS now has a network of 158 NEXRADs. = Dual-Polarized Weather Radar (Dual-Pol) = Dual-polarized (dual- pol) radar technology is truly a NOAA-wide accomplishment. NSSL spent nearly 30 years researching and developing the technology. The National Weather Service (NWS) and NSSL developed the specifications for the modification, which was tested by engineers at the NWS Radar Operations Center. The NWS Warning Decision Training Branch provided timely and relevant training to all NWS forecasters who would be using the technology. The upgraded radars offer 14 new radar products to better determine the type and intensity of precipitation, and can confirm tornadoes are on the ground causing damage. Dual-pol is the most significant enhancement made to the nation's radar network since Doppler radar was first installed in the early 1990s. = Multi- Function Phased Array Radar (MPAR) = More than 350 FAA radars and by 2025, nearly 150 of the nation's Doppler weather radars will need to be either replaced or have their service life extended. Phased array radars have been used by the military for many years to track aircraft. NSSL's MPAR program is investigating to see if both the aircraft surveillance and weather surveillance functions can be combined into one radar. Combining the operational requirements of these various radar systems with a single technology solution would result in fiscal savings, and lesser resources with a greater end result. = Mobile Radar = NSSL researchers teamed up with several universities to build a mobile Doppler radar: a Doppler radar mounted on the back of a truck. The mobile radar can be driven into position as a storm is developing to scan the atmosphere at low levels, below the beam of WSR-88D radars. NSSL has used mobile radars to study tornadoes, hurricanes, dust storms, winter storms, mountain rainfall, and even biological phenomena.  Warning Research & Development  = FACETs = Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs) serves as a broad-based framework and strategy to help focus and direct efforts related to next-generation science, technology and tools for forecasting environmental hazards. FACETs will address grid-based probabilistic threats, storm-scale observations and guidance, the forecaster, threat grid tools, useful output, effective response, and verification. = MYRORSS = The Multi-Year Reanalysis Of Remotely-Sensed Storms (MYRORSS ‚Äì pronounced ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù) NSSL and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to reconstruct and evaluate numerical model output and radar products derived from 15 years of WSR-88D data over the coterminous U.S. (CONUS). The end result of this research will be a rich dataset with a diverse range of applications, including severe weather diagnosis and climatological information. = Hazardous Weather Testbed = NOAA's Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) is jointly managed by NSSL, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and the National Weather Service Oklahoma City/Norman Weather Forecast Office (OUN) on the University of Oklahoma campus inside the National Weather Center. The HWT is designed to accelerate the transition of promising new meteorological insights and technologies into advances in forecasting and warning for hazardous mesoscale weather events throughout the United States. = Threats in Motion = One of the new warning methodologies being tested in the NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed is the ‚ÄúThreats-In-Motion‚Äù (TIM) concept. TIM warning grids update every minute and move continuously with the path of the storm. TIM has the advantage of providing useful lead times for all locations downstream of the hazards, and continually removes the warning from areas where threat has already passed. = FLASH = The Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrographs Project (FLASH) was launched in early 2012 to improve the accuracy and timing of flash flood warnings. FLASH uses forecast models, geographic information, and real-time high-resolution, accurate rainfall observations from the NMQ/Q2 project to produce flash flood forecasts at 1-km/5-min resolution. FLASH project development continues to be an active collaboration between members of NSSL's Stormscale Hydrometeorology and Hydromodeling Groups, and the HyDROS Lab at the University of Oklahoma. = CI-FLOW = The Coastal and Inland Flooding Observation and Warning (CI-FLOW) project is a demonstration projection that predicts the combined effects of coastal and inland floods for coastal North Carolina. CI-FLOW captures the complex interaction between rainfall, river flows, waves, and tides and storm surge, and how they will impact ocean and river water levels. NSSL, with support from the NOAA National Sea Grant, leads the large and unique interdisciplinary team.  Decision Support  In an effort to support NWS forecasters, NSSL investigates methods and techniques to diagnose severe weather events more quickly and accurately. = AWIPS2 = NSSL has more than ten NWS workstations‚Äîthe Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System 2 (AWIPS2)‚Äîavailable for use in product evaluation. NSSL uses these AWIPS2 stations to test and demonstrate warning products and techniques that have been developed here that will be available in the NWS Forecast Office in the future. = WDSS-II = In the 1990s, NSSL developed the Warning Decision Support System, to enhance NWS warning capabilities. NSSL continues to work on the next generation WDSS-II (Warning Decision Support System: Integrated Information/NMQ), a tool that quickly combines data streams from multiple radars, surface and upper air observations, lightning detection systems, and satellite and forecast models. This improved and expanded system will eventually be moved to National Weather Service operations as the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, and will automatically produce severe weather and precipitation products for improved decision-making capability within NOAA. = NSSL: On-Demand = NSSL: On-Demand is a web-based tool based on WDSS-II that helps confirm when and where severe weather occurred by mapping radar- detected circulations or hail on Google Earth satellite images. National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices, including those affected by the April 27, 2011 tornado outbreak, use the images to plan post event damage surveys. Emergency responders use On-Demand to produce high-resolution street maps of affected areas, so they can more effectively begin rescue and recovery efforts and damage assessments. = NSSL Development Lab = NSSL's Development Lab includes four wall-mounted plasma screen displays and enough room for at least 10 workstations. A large round table occupies the middle of the room for lunchtime ‚Äúbrown bag‚Äù discussions and other meetings. Researchers, forecasters and developers are using the lab to evaluate new platforms and techniques in real-time as a team. The workstations in the lab can be quickly adapted for visualization and incorporation of unique data sources including dual-pol and phased array radars. = NMQ = NSSL created a powerful research and development tool for the creation of new techniques, strategies and applications to better estimate and forecast precipitation amounts, locations and types. The National Mosaic and Multi-sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation system (NMQ) uses a combination of observing systems ranging from radars to satellites on a national scale to produce precipitation forecasts. = MRMS = The MRMS system is the proposed operational version of the Warning Decision Support System - Integrated Information (WDSS-II) and the National Mosaic Quantitative Precipitation Estimation system. MRMS is a system with automated algorithms that quickly and intelligently integrate data streams from multiple radars, surface and upper air observations, lightning detection systems, and satellite and forecast models. Numerous two-dimensional multiple-sensor products offer assistance for hail, wind, tornado, quantitative precipitation estimation forecasts, convection, icing, and turbulence diagnosis.The MRMS system was developed to produce severe weather and precipitation products for improved decision-making capability to improve severe weather forecasts and warnings, hydrology, aviation, and numerical weather prediction. = 3D-VAR = A weather-adaptive three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) system from NSSL/CIMMS automatically detects and analyzes supercell thunderstorms. The 3DVAR system uses data from the national WSR-88D radar network and NCEP's North American Mesoscale model product to automatically locate regions of thunderstorm activity. It is able to identify deep rotating updrafts that indicate a supercell thunderstorm at 1 km resolution every five minutes in these regions.  Field Research  NSSL participates in field research projects to collect weather data to increase knowledge about thunderstorm behavior and thunderstorm hazards. = Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) (2015) = PECAN was an extensive field project that focused on nighttime convection. PECAN was conducted across northern Oklahoma, central Kansas and into south-central Nebraska from 1 June to 15 July 2015. = VORTEX2 (2009-2010) = NSSL participated in the Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes EXperiment 2009-2010, an extensive project studying small scale kinematics, atmospheric variables and when and why tornadoes form. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Science Foundation (NSF) supported more than 100 scientists, students and staff from around the world to collect weather measurements around and under thunderstorms that could produce tornadoes. = VORTEX (1994-1995) = The Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes EXperiment was a two-year project designed to verify a number of ongoing questions about the causes of tornado formation. A new mobile Doppler radar was used and provided revolutionary data on several tornadic storms. = TOTO (1981-1987) = The TOtable TOrnado Observatory (TOTO), developed by NOAA Environmental Research Laboratory scientists, was a 55-gallon barrel outfitted with anemometers, pressure sensors, and humidity sensors, along with devices to record the data. In theory, a team would roll TOTO out of the back of the pickup in the path of a tornado, switch on the instruments, and get out of the way. Several groups tried to deploy TOTO over the years, but never took a direct hit. The closest TOTO ever came to success was in 1984 when it was sideswiped by the edge of a weak tornado and was knocked over. TOTO was retired in 1987. = Project Rough Rider (1980s) = Aircraft flew into thunderstorms to measure turbulence in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. This data was combined with measurements of the intensity of the rain from nearby WSR-57s to understand how thunderstorm echoes and turbulence are related, with the goal of improving short-term turbulence forecasts.  Observation  = Field Observing Systems =  Mobile Mesonet  Scientists and technicians from NSSL and the University of Oklahoma built their first Mobile Mesonet (MM) vehicles, a.k.a. ‚Äúprobes,‚Äù in 1992. Probes are modified minivans with a suite of weather instruments mounted atop a roof rack and a complex of computer and communication equipment inside. NSSL scientists drive these through storms and storm environments to make measurements of temperature, pressure, humidity and wind.  2-Dimensional Video Distrometer (2DVD)  NSSL's 2DVD takes high speed video pictures, from two different angles, of anything falling from the sky through its viewing area (such as raindrops, hail or snow). It is used in polarimetric radar studies by measuring rain rate, drop shape and size distribution, and other parameters useful in narrowing down the accuracy of precipitation identification algorithms.  Portable Observation Device (POD)  NSSL has available small portable weather platforms with sensors that measure temperature, pressure, moisture, wind speed and direction, and an instrument called a Parsivel (PARticle, SIze, VELocity) disdrometer. These can be deployed quickly in the field, in and around thunderstorms.  Weather balloons  NSSL launches special research weather balloon systems into thunderstorms. Measurements from the sensor packages attached to the balloons provide data about conditions inside the storm where it has often proved too dangerous for research aircraft to fly.  Particle Size Image and Velocity Probe (PASIV)  PASIV is a balloon-borne instrument designed to capture images of water and ice particles as it is launched into, and rises up through, a thunderstorm. The instrument is flown as part of a ‚Äútrain‚Äù of other instruments connected one after another to a balloon. These other instruments measure electrical field strength and direction, and other variables such as temperature, dewpoint, pressure and winds.  Collaborative Lower Atmospheric Mobile Profiling System (CLAMPS)  NSSL has a mobile, trailer- based boundary layer profiling facility using commercially available sensors. CLAMPS contains a Doppler lidar, a multi-channel microwave radiometer, and an Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). CLAMPS meets a NOAA/NWS operational and research need of for profiles of temperature, humidity, and winds near the surface of the earth.  Electric Field Meters (EFM)  NSSL's Field Observing Facilities and Support group (FOFS) is responsible for a device called an Electric Field Meter (EFM) that is attached, along with other instruments, to a special research balloon and launched into thunderstorms. As they are carried up through electrified storms, these EFMs are designed to measure the strength and direction of the electric fields that build up before lightning strikes occur. Data from this instrument helps researchers learn more about the electrical structure of storms.  Mobile laboratories  NSSL operates two mobile laboratories (custom built by an ambulance company) called NSSL6 and NSSL7, outfitted with computer and communication systems, balloon launching equipment, and weather instruments. These mobile labs can be deployed on a rapid basis to collect data or coordinate field operations.  Mobile Doppler radar  NSSL researchers with the University of Oklahoma built their first mobile Doppler radar in 1993. Current versions of mobile radars (for example, NSSL's NOXP) can be driven into positions very close to storms, observing details that are typically out of sight of the beam of more distant WSR-88D radars. NSSL has also used mobile radars to study tornadoes, hurricanes, dust storms, winter storms, mountain rainfall, and even biological phenomena. = Fixed Observing Systems =  Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (OKLMA)  NSSL installed, operates and maintains the OKLMA. Thousands of points can be mapped for an individual lightning flash to reveal its location and the development of its structure. NSSL scientists hope to learn more about how storms produce intra- cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes and how each type is related to tornadoes and other severe weather.  Satellite  NSSL researchers are working on products that use GOES satellite data to identify rapidly growing clouds that might indicate a developing thunderstorm. They are also working on products that estimate wind shear and stability in the surrounding environment to forecast the future severity of the storm.  Boundary layer profilers  NSSL uses special instruments mounted on the top of the National Weather Center that can measure the thermodynamic properties of the lowest 1‚Äì2 km of the atmosphere (boundary layer). Researchers study the data to learn more about the structure of the boundary layer, shallow convective cloud processes, the interaction between clouds, aerosols, radiation, precipitation and the thermodynamic environment, mixed phase clouds, and more. Numerical models, such as those used for climate and weather prediction, have large uncertainties in all of these areas. Researchers also use these observations to improve our understanding and representation of these processes.  SHAVE  NSSL uses observations from people too! The mostly student-run NSSL/CIMMS Severe Hazards Analysis and Verification Experiment (SHAVE) collects hail, wind damage and flash flooding reports through phone surveys. SHAVE reports, when combined with the voluntary reports collected by the NWS, creates a unique and comprehensive database of severe and non-severe weather events and enhances climatological information about severe storm threats in the U.S.  mPING  Another way NSSL uses public observations is through the Meteorological Phenomena Identification Near the Ground (mPING) project. Volunteers can report on the precipitation that is reaching the ground at their location through mobile apps (iOS and Android). Researchers compare the reports of precipitation with what is detected by the dual-polarized radar data to refine precipitation identification algorithms.  Simulation  NSSL researchers have created a computer model that can simulate a thunderstorm to study how changes in the environment can affect its behavior. They also contribute to the development of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model used in both research and NWS operations. = NSSL WRF = The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is the product of a unique collaboration between the meteorological research and forecasting communities. Its level of sophistication is appropriate for cutting edge research, yet it operates efficiently enough to produce high resolution guidance for front-line forecasters in a timely manner. Working at the interface between research and operations, NSSL scientists have been major contributors to WRF development efforts and continue to provide leadership in the operational implementation and testing of WRF. The NSSL WRF generates daily, real-time 1- to 36-hour experimental forecasts at a 4 km resolution of precipitation, lightning threat, and more. = COMMAS = The NSSL COllaborative Model for Multiscale Atmospheric Simulation (COMMAS) is a 3D cloud model used to recreate thunderstorms for closer study. COMMAS is able to ingest radar data and lightning data from past events. Researchers use COMMAS to explore the microphysical structure and evolution of the storm and the relationship between microphysics and storm electricity. They also use COMMAS to simulate different phases of significant events, such as the early tornadic phase of the Greensburg, Kansas supercell that destroyed much of the town in 2004. = FLASH = The Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrographs Project (FLASH) was launched in early 2012 largely in response to the demonstration and real-time availability of high-resolution, accurate rainfall observations from the NMQ/Q2 project. FLASH introduces a new paradigm in flash flood prediction that uses the NMQ forcing and produces flash flood forecasts at 1-km/5-min resolution through direct, forward simulation. The primary goal of the FLASH project is to improve the accuracy, timing, and specificity of flash flood warnings in the US, thus saving lives and protecting infrastructure. The FLASH team is composed of researchers and students who use an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to achieve the goal.  Testbeds  = Hazardous Weather Testbed = NOAA's Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) is jointly managed by NSSL, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and the National Weather Service Oklahoma City/Norman Weather Forecast Office (OUN) on the University of Oklahoma campus inside the National Weather Center. The HWT is designed to accelerate the transition of promising new meteorological insights and technologies into advances in forecasting and warning for hazardous mesoscale weather events throughout the United States. = National Weather Radar Testbed = NOAA's National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT) is a phased array radar (PAR) being tested and evaluated in Norman, Oklahoma. The NWRT was established to demonstrate the potential to simultaneously perform aircraft tracking, wind profiling, and weather surveillance as a multi-function phased- array radar (MPAR). The advanced capabilities of the NWRT could lead to better warnings of severe weather.

He is currently preparing a similar edition in Italian and English. He also translated the Swiss constitution into Arabic for the Swiss Confederation.  Biography  Born to a family of Christian peasants, in Zababdeh, near Jenin, he attended primary school in his village (1956‚Äì61) before joining the Minor Seminary of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in Beit-Jala, near Bethlehem (1961‚Äì65). Four years later he left to attend a course in tailoring at the Salesian Technical School of Bethlehem (1965‚Äì1968), and worked in the tailoring trade in Jenin while, at the same time, working for the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 1970 he immatriculated at Jenin as a self-taught student, and thereafter obtained a scholarship from the l'≈íuvre Saint-Justin in Fribourg, to study in Switzerland. In April 1974, he received his Law degree from the University of Fribourg cum laude, and then went on to study for a doctorate of Laws at the University of Fribourg and enrolled in the Graduate Institute of International Studies at Geneva to simultaneously study for an Honours degree in Political Science. He was awarded a degree with Honours from the Graduate Institute at Geneva in January 1976, His dissertation was entitled: \\"The Right of peoples to sovereignty, analytic study of the Marxist-Leninist theory and the soviet position\\". Researching for his doctoral thesis, he spent a year in Egypt. He defended his thesis: \\"The impact of religion on the legal order, case of Egypt, non-Muslims in an Islamic country\\" in December 1978 at the Faculty of Law in Fribourg, receiving the distinction summa cum laude. His graduation took place after the publication of his thesis on 14 November 1979. During his studies he received a grant from l'≈íuvre Saint-Justin in Fribourg (1970‚Äì1977) and a grant from the Swiss Confederation (1977‚Äì1979). During his stay in Egypt (1976‚Äì77), he interviewed forty Egyptian personalities. He intends to publish these interviews in the near future. He was a federal civil servant at the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law in Lausanne from 1 November 1980 to 31 December 2009, heading the Department of Arab and Islamic law. As part of his duties, he wrote hundreds of legal opinions for Swiss and foreign authorities, for courts, lawyers, enterprises as well as for private individuals in the fields of family law, inheritance, criminal law and commercial law. In the course of his travels in Arab countries, he built up the most comprehensive collection of works on Arab and Muslim Law in Western Europe for the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law. During his work for the Swiss Confederation, he traveled to the following countries, in order to purchase books and to maintain contacts with law schools and research centers: Morocco (4 times), Algeria (twice), Tunisia (5 times), Libya (3 times), Egypt (9 times), Sudan (once), Jordan (4 times), Lebanon (twice), Syria (3 times), Iraq (once), Iran (once), Bahrain (twice), Kuwait (twice), United Arab Emirates (twice), Oman (twice), Palestine / Israel (7 times), South Yemen (once), North Yemen (twice), Qatar (once), Saudi Arabia (twice).

She first appears in the 2000 video game Final Fantasy IX as the princess of the kingdom Alexandria and one of its lead characters. In this game, she is trying to escape her kingdom and joins with her kidnappers, including protagonist Zidane Tribal, to do so. She assumes the pseudonym Dagger and cuts her hair, at which point the writers began to treat her as a different character while writing her. In time, she discovers herself adopted, having come from a village of summoners. Her original concept art was created by Yoshitaka Amano, while the final version was handled by Toshiyuki Itahana, as well as Shunkou Murase and Shin Nagasawa, who handled the in-game version of the character. Her design was meant to strike a balance between realism and a comic-like style, taking inspiration from the characters in the film The Dark Crystal. She appears in multiple other Final Fantasy games, including Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Record Keeper, and Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia. Garnet received praise from critics as a standout of Final Fantasy IXs cast, ranking highly as a female character in the Final Fantasy series. Her romantic and familial relationships have also been the subject of discussion from critics, both positively and negatively. Concept and creation Garnet was created for the 2000 video game Final Fantasy IX. The original concept art for Garnet was created by Yoshitaka Amano, and the final version was created by Toshiyuki Itahana, as well as Shunkou Murase and Shin Nagasawa, who also handled the in-game version of the character. Her character design was meant to strike a balance between realism and a comic- like style, while taking inspiration from the style employed for the characters in the film The Dark Crystal. Composer Nobuo Uematsu was asked to compose Garnet's theme song, among others. At one point in the game, Garnet cuts her hair, a scene which event designer Kazuhiko Aoki felt was an important one in the story of Final Fantasy IX. He explains that it is a quiet moment among otherwise frenetic action and was important to the game's pacing. He was worried about how Garnet would be handled with this and told the writers that they would have to effectively write two Garnets, one with long hair and one with short. Event planner Nobuaki Komoto found this difficult, adding that players tended to have different images of Garnet in their heads. He felt that a person's thoughts on the character are reflected by which depiction they think of. While the development team referred to her as Dagger, the nickname she chooses to disguise her identity, most players still referred to her as Garnet. Garnet was first revealed in a Coca-Cola advertisement featuring other characters from Final Fantasy IX. Appearances alt=Garnet faces the camera, hair cut to chin level, with a light smile. Garnet first appears in the video game Final Fantasy IX as one of its lead characters. She is a princess of Alexandria Castle, and the daughter of Queen Brahne. Protagonist Zidane Tribal and others come to kidnap her, and she reveals to them that she wants to be kidnapped for her own purposes. When her and her kidnappers' identities are revealed, the Queen orders her soldiers to attack the stage; however, Garnet and her kidnappers are able to escape. Along with her and her kidnappers, a knight named Adelbert Steiner and a Black Mage named Vivi Ornitier join them. She is captured by a monster when their ship crash lands in a forest, from which the others help her escape. Garnet assumes a different identity and calls herself 'Dagger' after seeing Zidane's dagger. She discovers the existence of a factory producing robotic Black Mages owned by Alexandria, which causes her distress. Garnet and her group escape to Lindblum, where Garnet meets her uncle Cid, who she learns paid the kidnappers to take her to him, as he felt her unsafe there. Despite being ordered by Cid to stay at the castle, she and Steiner sneak away so that she can confront Brahne. Zidane and Vivi join with them, and when they return to Alexandria, Brahne betrays her, having her eidolons ‚Äî powerful creatures usable by Summoners ‚Äî extracted from her. Brahne uses these to decimate other kingdoms along with a mysterious man named Kuja, before ordering Garnet killed. She is rescued by her allies, with the help of her kingdom's general, Beatrix. She is conflicted over her mother's behavior as well as the eidolons, of which she was not aware. The party intends to seek out Kuja, and on their path, Garnet and Zidane must participate in a wedding ceremony due to a location only allowing married couples to enter. Garnet meets a girl named Eiko Carol, the last survivor of her summoners' village, and Garnet goes on to learn her true past, learning that Brahne was not her biological mother. Brahne tries to betray Kuja, but is fatally wounded in the process. Garnet encounters her, and Brahne apologizes for what she did, and asks for forgiveness, which she is granted. Garnet becomes the Queen and the party goes its separate ways, though shortly thereafter, Kuja attacks Alexandria with the eidolon Bahamut, which Garnet and Eiko work together to summon Alexander, which defeats Bahamut. However, a man named Garland decimates Alexandria, leaving Garnet mute from guilt. The group pursues Kuja, and Garnet later returns to her mother's grave, where she breaks her silence to state that she will defend her kingdom, before cutting off her ponytail using Zidane's dagger. She and the party travel to the planet Terra to pursue Kuja, where they do battle with Garland and Kuja, who were working together, as well as the malicious being Necron. Zidane is lost as the rest return to their home planet, with Garnet returning home to rule. However, Zidane returns to Alexandria, and Garnet embraces him in tears. Garnet appears in both the mobile version of Theatrhythm Final Fantasy and its sequel, Curtain Call. She also appears in the video games Final Fantasy: Record Keeper and Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia. A figurine of Garnet was released as part of Square Enix's Bring Arts line, sold as a pair along with Zidane. Reception Since her appearance in Final Fantasy IX, Garnet has received generally positive reception. In a poll of fans of Final Fantasy, Garnet was ranked eighth on the list of greatest female Final Fantasy characters. USgamer found Garnet to be one of the best-written role-playing game characters. Jef Rouner of the Houston Press found her more likable than protagonist Zidane based on her more notable character arc, while Touch Arcade writer Shaun Musgrave found the story of Final Fantasy IX at its strongest when Garnet or Vivi were the focus. Writer Daniella Lucas initially did not like Garnet, stating that she saw Garnet as just a damsel in distress. However, once Lucas acquired more life experience, she began to relate to her more, citing Garnet's struggles with her mother and guilt over what happened to Alexandria. Ashley Barry, writing for The Mary Sue, felt similarly; Barry grew up seeing Garnet as weak, due in part to her \\"traditional femininity,\\" but discovered that they only thought this because they were raised to see femininity as weak. They noticed Garnet seeming happier when she had control of herself and defying the limitations put upon her. The subject of Garnet's relationship with other characters has been a topic of discussion among critics. RPGSite writer Natalie Flores found Garnet's relationship with her mother intriguing, praising Brahne's passing and apology to Garnet as one of the series' most touching moments. Flores noted that it portrays a complex relationship, one that writers of later Final Fantasy should refer to when they portray motherhood. Writers Mikel Reparaz and Jason Wojnar of GamesRadar+ and Screen Rant respectively felt that the relationship between Garnet and Zidane was poor, with the former citing a lack of chemistry between the two characters as the cause. IGN writer Leah B. Jackson was more positive towards their relationship, finding the early premise that Garnet wanted to be kidnapped by Zidane intriguing. Author Sean Atkinson discussed her musical theme, \\"Melodies of Life\\", and how it is used to represent particular relationships, namely those with Zidane and Eiko. Atkinson noted that it combines two themes heard throughout the game which are important to Garnet, suggesting that the execution of the two component themes and the complete theme is meant to show that Garnet and Zidane are destined to be together.

It is located at the northern terminus of Nevada State Route 290, about northeast of U.S. Highway 95 and a total of north of Winnemucca. The town is located in a broad valley, with the Santa Rosa Range of mountains just to the northwest. At the 2010 census, the population of the CDP was 109. History A post office has been in operation at Paradise Valley since 1871. According to tradition, in the 1860s a prospector declared \\"What a paradise!\\" upon seeing the valley, after having traveled through the surrounding arid territory. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 109 people, 51 households, and 35 families residing in the CDP. There were 92 housing units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.0% White, 1.8% Native American, 6.4% some other race, and 2.8% from two or more races. 18.3% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Paradise Valley Folklife Project The American Folklife Center of the U.S. Library of Congress conducted extensive ethnographic field research in Paradise Valley from 1978 to 1982. The Paradise Valley Folklife Project generated a multi-format resource collection documenting the history and culture of the area's ranching community. A team of fieldworkers from AFC documented the distinct ethnic groups in the area (Apache, Anglo, Basque, Chinese, German, Italian and Northern Paiute); the history of the region, including archaeological remains of a Chinese community, foodways, and oral traditions.

Phantom debuted in the #1 spot on The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists, among others. Publishing history Following the hit sales of the other books in the Sword of Truth series, Tor ran 500,000 copies in Phantom's first printing.Abbott, Charlotte. On-Sale Next Week: Terry Goodkind, Publishers Weekly, published July 10, 2006. Accessed August 4, 2009. The author pre-signed 10,000 copies of the book before the release. Plot introduction A continuation of the story in Chainfire, Phantom begins with Richard Rahl searching for his wife, Kahlan Amnell, whom only he remembers. As the reader discovered in Chainfire, the spell used to make everyone forget Kahlan, Chainfire, was initiated by the Sisters of the Dark, working for the Keeper of the Underworld. Richard reveals that not only the spell but also all magic has been corrupted due to the effects of the chimes being in the world. Due to this corruption Kahlan is not invisible to everyone and Jagang uses this fact to continue to control her. Plot summary The story continues with Richard's quest to find his wife, Kahlan, and release her from the Chainfire spell. Kahlan still travels with the Sisters of the Dark Ulicia, Cecilia and Armina as they hurry to catch up with the fourth Sister, Tovi. Unbeknownst to them, Tovi is dead, stabbed by Samuel and allowed to die after being questioned by Nicci. They stop at the White Horse Inn, and the Sisters are shocked when the innkeeper can see Kahlan and correctly title her. Because of the Chainfire enacted on Kahlan, no one should be able to know she exists. She was erased from the memories of all who knew her and anyone who sees her instantly forgets. The Sisters kill the man and his family, and continue on, traveling toward Caska where they believe Tovi has gone. Back at the Wizard's Keep, Richard senses powerful magic and goes to investigate. He discovers Zedd, Ann and Nathan in a room where Nicci is caught up in the grips of a powerful spell called a verification web. The web is meant to examine the Chainfire spell and see if there is any way to undo it. Richard realizes that there is something wrong with the spell, recognizing that the corruption of the spell was caused by the presence of the three chimes - Reechani, Sentrosi, Vasi - being in the world, and the chimes not only corrupted the verification web, but they have corrupted all magic, including the Chainfire spell. Despite the other three's refusal of his analysis, he is able to disable the spell to release Nicci before the spell kills her. Before Nicci can tell anyone that the spell was indeed corrupted, the deadly beast that Jagang had created to hunt Richard appears in the room. In order to drive it off, Nicci places herself back into the spell form to draw upon the power between life and death. By refusing to actually supply the magic to the spell, the power of life and the power of the underworld come together and strike the beast, driving it away for the time being. Richard saves her from the spell a second time. Shota arrives at the Keep, bringing Jebra in an attempt to make Richard believe that he is wasting his time trying to find Kahlan when there is a whole world that needs to be saved from the Imperial Order. To that end, she instructs Jebra to testify to the horrific terrors that had befallen the people of Ebissinia. Shota reveals that Samuel was under the control of another witch woman, Six. Richard says that he understands the situations, but Shota remains unconvinced and touches him with her power, opening his mind to see a vision that places Richard in the position of the slaughtered men of Ebissinia, who are condemned to death while listening to the vulgar promises of what the soldiers will do to their wives. In this dream-like reality, Richard sees Kahlan begging for his life and they profess their love for each other. As Nicci and Shota have a minor confrontation, Richard realizes that Shota is right. Despite how important Kahlan's life is to him, it is only one life, while the whole of the New World is threatened by the Order. Pleased, Shota gives Richard a prediction she has had from the flow of time. Long ago, the First Wizard Barracus went to the Temple of the Winds to ensure that someone with the Subtractive side of the gift would be born again. After Barracus came back from the temple, he threw himself out his window, but not before he left a special book for Richard. Before Shota leaves, she gives him one last cryptic message: His mother was not the only one to die in the fire that claimed her life. After such events, Richard comes to understand that he was right all along when he earlier stated that it is impossible to fight the hordes of Imperial Order forces head on in one great final battle. Richard, Nicci and Cara travel in the Sliph to the main army in D'Hara and explain to the commanders what he has come to understand and his position. Richard issues a command that the army be broken up into smaller units, stating that if the Old World wants war, then they shall have it. The tactic being that while the Imperial Order is here in the New World, they shall become the Phantom D'Haran Legion, bringing death and destruction to the Old World. The death and destruction will be an endless reminder of what will happen to those who support the Order. He orders the troops to kill anyone who opposes them, burn crops, and bring him the ears of anyone who preaches the beliefs of the Order. His troops destroy entire garrisons of troops, impaling their heads on stakes, skin bureaucrats of the empire alive and impale them on stakes, and follow the strategy of slash-and-burn warfare to starve the men, women and children of the empire. The three Sisters of the Dark and Kahlan follow Sister Tovi's trail to Caska, where they are surprised to find not Tovi (who has been dead since the end of the previous book), but Jagang waiting for them. Jagang once again proves that he is a master strategist by revealing that he had never left the Sisters of the Dark's minds and that by tricking them into thinking their fake bond with Richard was working, he learned much from their quest. He also captures Kahlan, him being able to see her because he was linked to the Dark Sister when they performed the Chainfire spell on Kahlan, and was therefore unaffected by it. Meanwhile, while traveling back to the Wizard's Keep through the Sliph, Richard is attacked by Jagang's beast and magic conjured by the previously thought to be dead Princess Violet (now Queen Violet at Six's instruction), causing him to become separated from his power. The Sliph instigates \\"emergency measures\\" instilled in her thousands of years ago by First Wizard Barracus and shunts Richard to an emergency escape portal somewhere in the wilds close to the land of the Night Wisps. Richard must pass a test Barracus left for him before the Sliph will tell him why he needs to see the Night Wisps. After a brief visit to the land of the Night Wisps to recover a secret book left by the War Wizard Barracus (who left the outfit and ruby pendant), Secrets of a War Wizard's Power. Richard is captured by Six and taken to Tamarang. There, he hides Secrets of a War Wizard's Power in the room that he was tortured in during Wizard's First Rule, deciding that regardless of what happens to him, he cannot let anyone find the book that Barracus hid for 3000 years for him. While being taken to Violet, Richard attempts an escape killing dozens of Imperial Order soldiers. The commanding officer is impressed with his skill and takes Richard away as a captive to become a player of Ja'La dh Jin (Game of Life) on his division's team. The division of the Imperial Order rejoins the main forces, now laying siege on the People's Palace. Richard catches a glimpse of Kahlan as he is taken into the camp and revives her will to fight on and remember her past. Back at the Wizard's Keep, while discussing Richard's desire to save Kahlan, Zedd states that even though Richard is trying hard, Kahlan is as good as dead. The Chainfire spell put in place over her destroys memories, not just overlap them or bury them; Kahlan will never remember any of them, even Richard, ever again. Nicci has a revelation about the all important Prophecies that Richard must lead them in the final battle and puts one of the Boxes of Orden in play in Richard's name, so that not only the Sisters of the Dark have superiority in that matter. The book ends with a few major cliffhangers: Richard is a captive in the Imperial Order's main camp, without his sword or his gift; Kahlan is a captive of Jagang with a Rada'han; the Boxes of Orden are in play by Nicci; there is a problem with Chainfire and with magic; that the Imperial Order is slowly making their way into the central stronghold of the D'Haran forces: the People's Palace, but also the D'Haran forces appear able to cut off the Imperial Order supply lines just as winter starts. Characters Wizard's Tenth Rule The Wizard's Tenth Rule, revealed in Phantom, is: It is explained in the novel as follows: \\"People who for whatever reason don't want to see the truth can be acutely hostile to it and shrill in their denunciation of it. They frequently turn their venomous antagonism on whoever dares to point out that truth ... To those seeking the truth, it's a matter of simple, rational, self-interest to always keep reality in view. Truth is rooted in reality, after all, not the imagination.\\" References External links * Official Terry Goodkind website * Chapter 1 of the book * Unofficial Terry Goodkind website (endorsed by Terry Goodkind) Category:2006 American novels Category:2006 fantasy novels Category:Fantasy novels Category:The Sword of Truth books Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Phantom (Sword of Truth)"},{"id":"2095974","text":"Andr√°ssy Avenue () is a boulevard in Budapest, Hungary, dating back to 1872. It links Erzs√©bet Square with the V√°rosliget. Lined with spectacular Neo- renaissance mansions and townhouses featuring fine facades and interiors, it was recognised as a World Heritage Site in 2002. It is also one of Budapest's main shopping streets, with fine cafes, restaurants, theatres, Embassies and luxury boutiques.UNESCO Among the most noticeable buildings are the State Opera House, the former Ballet School (under reconstruction for several years), the Zolt√°n Kod√°ly Memorial Museum and Archives, the Hungarian University of Fine Arts and the Ferenc Hopp Museum of East Asian Arts. History 1875, Andr√°ssy Avenue at V√°czy k√∂r√∫t (now Bajcsy-Zsilinszky √∫t) It was decreed to be built in 1870, to discharge the parallel Kir√°ly utca from heavy traffic and to connect the inner city parts with the City Park. Its construction began in 1872 and the avenue was inaugurated on August 20 (a national holiday), 1876. Its realization was a blend of the plans proposed by the top 3 competitors Lajos Lechner, Frigyes Feszl and Klein & Fraser. Its palaces were built by the most distinguished architects (led by Mikl√≥s Ybl) of the time, financed by Hungarian and other banking houses. These were mostly finished by 1884 and mostly aristocrats, bankers, landowners and historical families moved in. It was named in 1885 after the main supporter of the plan, Prime Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy. The construction of the Budapest Metro, the first underground railway in Continental Europe, was proposed in 1870, since the capital had always been opposed to surface transport on this road. Construction began in 1894 and was finished in 1896, so this new metro line could facilitate the transport to V√°rosliget, the main venue of the millennium celebrations of Hungary. Cross-section of the first metro line under Andr√°ssy √∫t, 1890s The boulevard was renamed three times in the 1950s; a testament to the rapid political changes of the period. It became Szt√°lin √∫t (\\"Stalin Street\\") in 1950 during the Soviet occupation. During the 1956 uprising it was renamed to Magyar Ifj√∫s√°g √∫tja (\\"Avenue of Hungarian Youth\\"). The following year the governing communists changed the name to N√©pk√∂zt√°rsas√°g √∫t (\\"People's Republic Street\\"). The former name of Andr√°ssy was restored in 1990, after the end of the communist era. In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture G√©za Sz≈ëcs officially announced plans to build a new structure along Andr√°ssy √∫t close to City Park and near the existing Budapest Museum of Fine Arts and Budapest Art Hall (M≈±csarnok). This building would house the collections of the current Hungarian National Gallery. This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is referred to as the Budapest Museum Quarter or Andr√°ssy Quarter. However, since that announcement the plans changed several times and have now been reduced to three new museum buildings in and around the city park. Sections H≈ës√∂k tere Kod√°ly k√∂r√∂nd 4 - 1895 Andr√°ssy √∫t consists of four main parts, from inside to outside as follows: # From Erzs√©bet t√©r to Oktogon: an urban-like part mostly for commercial purposes. # From Oktogon to Kod√°ly k√∂r√∂nd: widened with an all√©e, including residential areas and universities. # From Kod√°ly k√∂r√∂nd to Bajza utca: it is even more widened, and residential palaces are fronted by small gardens. # From Bajza utca to V√°rosliget: the same width; villas encompassed by gardens, including a couple of embassies.

In the story, this adaptation usually takes the form of growing spikes, blades or similar weapons. The plastic also processes toxins of all kinds, essentially making Churchyard immortal. The stories take place 400 years after this experiment. Churchyard is by now tired of his immortality and wants to die.

The demographics of the student body that year was 70.1% African American, 18.3% White, 7.3% Hispanic, 0.6% Asian, 0.1% American Indian, and 3.6% from two or more races. A three-time U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon Award for Academic Excellence winner (1983, 1996, 2002), Homewood-Flossmoor continues to be ranked nationally, including as one of America‚Äôs Most Challenging High Schools by The Washington Post. In 2012‚Äì13, Homewood-Flossmoor became the first public high school in Chicago's suburbs to earn the International Baccalaureate World School status. Homewood-Flossmoor has an Advanced Placement program (25 AP courses in 2017-18); a five-course Project Lead the Way STEM program; and a Media, Visual & Performing Arts Academy (MVP). The campus consists of a North* and South Building. The South Building contains a number of sub-buildings each assigned a letter, and includes the school's radio station (WHFH) 88.5 FM Flossmoor, television station VTV, science labs, a swimming pool, a music building, gymnasium and an auditorium. An ice rink is also located on the campus, owned by the local park district. In 2014, H-F took part in a multimillion-dollar ($26,070,000 contract) renovation of the North Building on campus. The renovations included a new 200-meter track containing four full-sized basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts in the center of the track. The 9,000-sq. ft. facility also contains cardio and training equipment. Additionally, a 50-yard indoor turf has expanded the playing and practice season for a variety of field sports and activities, including football, soccer, field hockey, baseball and marching band. The project was finished in late spring 2014. In 2015, H-F was awarded a Gold LEED Award for outstanding environmental practices in the construction of this addition. In 2019, the school began the first phase of its Fine Arts Expansion Project, which will add a new music wing and performance center, in addition to renovated visual arts classrooms. Expected completion date for the project is October 2020. History Homewood-Flossmoor Community High School site opened in 1959 with enrollment at 1,170 students. There were 51 classrooms, which included 10 English classes, 10 Social Science, eight Science, six Mathematics, five Foreign Language, three Physical Education, one Homemaking, three Industrial Arts, two Art, and three Music classes. A cafeteria, library and administrative area were also included. By 1965, the school's population had nearly doubled and additional buildings were added: Auditorium (1965), G Building (1966) and E Building (1966). As growth continued, it became apparent that a major new facility was needed, and in 1971, the North Building and fieldhouse opened when the student population topped 4,000. Following a decade of preparation and fiscal planning, in 1995 a $25 million renovation and addition program was completed: all classrooms and offices were wired for internet access; a music wing was added, providing student practice and performance; a Technology Center and numerous labs to offer computer assisted instruction were completed; the Mall Building, located mid-campus near the football field and field house, was expanded, modernized and staffed, providing athletic training and rehabilitation of student athletes; a new Olympic sized aqua-center was opened; 14 tennis courts were added; and the student-run WHFH radio and TV stations were modernized. In 1989, football coach John Wrenn proposed District 233 adopt a mandatory drug-testing policy similar to one at two Lafayette, Indiana high schools, where a recent landmark court case decision allowed the creation of such programs. H-F became the first high school in Illinois to require mandatory random drug testing for its student athletes. In 1996, the school gained publicity when up to 20,000 people gathered on the school lawn to hear President Bill Clinton deliver a speech on education during his 1996 reelection campaign. In addition to being named a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education three times, the school has received Department of Education Technology Award twice. In 1995, the school's technology plan was named one of the five best in the nation. In spring 2013, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Organization granted IB World School status to Homewood-Flossmoor. H-F now joins the exclusive company of approximately 3,000 IB World Schools that dot the globe across 138 countries.

It was an unincorporated town in Clark County until 1981 when it was merged with Overton to create the unincorporated town of Moapa Valley. The community is the home of the annual Clark County Fair and Rodeo. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department patrols the town. History View of Logandale Established on the west side of the Muddy River in 1865, Logandale was originally named West Point. It was enlarged and renamed Saint Joseph in 1868, by settlers driven out of their first town of Saint Joseph, Nevada on the east side of the Muddy River when it burned down. It also acquired the post office established in the old town on August 26, 1867. The new Saint Joseph like the other Mormon settlements in the Moapa Valley was abandoned in 1871 due to a tax dispute with the state of Nevada. Its post office closed in October 1871 but became active again on in May 1876. Following the Mormon return to Overton in 1880, in November 1883 the post office operations were moved there.Carlson, Helen S., Nevada Place Names, University of Nevada Press, 1974 The town began to revive in 1912 around a railroad station with the name Logan, for a Civil War veteran who settled on the abandoned town site. It was subsequently renamed Logandale in order to avoid repetition with Logan, Utah.  Geography  Logandale is located at the north end of Moapa Valley. The town can be accessed by taking exit 93 off of Interstate Highway 15, going south on Highway 169. Demographics Logandale is in the Moapa Valley, Nevada Census Bureau Census-designated place (CDP).  Media  KADD is licensed to the town.

Biography Jongen was born in Li√®ge, where his parents had moved from Flanders. On the strength of an amazing precocity for music, he was admitted to the Li√®ge Conservatoire at the extraordinarily young age of seven, and spent the next sixteen years there. Jongen won a First Prize for Fugue in 1895, an honors diploma in piano the next year, and another for organ in 1896. In 1897, he won the Belgian Prix de Rome, which allowed him to travel to Italy, Germany and France. He began composing at the age of 13, and immediately exhibited exceptional talent in that field too. By the time he published his Opus 1, he already had dozens of works to his credit. His monumental and massive First String Quartet was composed in 1894 and was submitted for the annual competition for fine arts held by the Royal Academy of Belgium, where it was awarded the top prize by the jury. In 1902, he returned to his native land, and in the following year he was named a professor of harmony and counterpoint at his old Li√®ge college. With the outbreak of World War I, he and his family moved to England, where he founded a piano quartet. When peace returned, he came back to Belgium and was named professor of fugue at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. From 1925 until 1939, he served as director of that institution; he was succeeded by his brother L√©on Jongen. Fourteen years after leaving the directorship, Joseph Jongen died at Sart-lez-Spa, Belgium. Compositions From his teens to his seventies Jongen composed a great deal, including symphonies, concertos (for cello, for piano and for harp), chamber music (notably a late string trio and three string quartets), and songs, some with piano, others with orchestra. (His list of opus numbers eventually reached 241, but he destroyed many pieces.) Today, the only part of his oeuvre performed with any regularity is his output for organ, much of it solo, some of it in combination with other instruments. His monumental Symphonie Concertante of 1926 is a tour de force, considered by many to be among the greatest works ever written for organ and orchestra. Numerous eminent organists of modern times (such as Virgil Fox, Alexander Frey, Jean Guillou, Michael Murray and Olivier Latry) have championed and recorded it. The work was commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker for debut in the Grand Court of his palatial Philadelphia department store, Wanamaker's. Its intended use was for the re-dedication of the world's largest pipe organ there, the Wanamaker Organ, as part of a series of concerts Rodman Wanamaker funded with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wanamaker's death in 1928 precluded the performance of the work at that time in the venue for which it was written, but it was finally performed for the first time with the Wanamaker Organ and the Philadelphia Orchestra on 27 September 2008. In 1945, Jongen composed the Mass, Op. 130, for choir, brass and organ, in memory of his brother Alphonse.  Honours  * 1919: Officer of the Order of Leopold.Royal Order of H.M.

The 'White Pele' nickname came about because of his natural ability, grace and technique: \\"It was when I made my debut for Sheffield Wednesday at Bolton. My dad had brought me back and I got a few phone calls asking how the game had gone, and someone told me that there was a banner at the Park End at Goodison saying something about me and the white Pele ‚Äì it was a very proud moment for me! For someone to say that about you comparing you to probably the best player that ever played the game is really unbelievable. To think that people thought that much of me was hard to believe.\\"Everton Secrets ‚Äì Colin Harvey's autobiography.

We had lunch and then we had a team meeting. Harry Catterick said there would be only one change. He said \\"Dennis Stevens ‚Äì you move to number 4 and Colin Harvey goes to number 8\\" This was all because Gabby was injured at the time. It was as simple as that! I just gasped, I didn't have a clue that I was going to play ‚Äì it was a great way of doing it, he didn't give me a chance to think about it, I just had to go out there and play! I thought no-one was going to expect too much of me, I just went out there and done my best and I did okay.\\" =Holy Trinity= Harvey became a part of the famous midfield trio known as the \\"Holy Trinity\\" with Alan Ball and Howard Kendall.

Of the late 1960s/early 70s Everton side, George Best said \\"they were a delight to watch and indeed play against.\\" It was in fact Harvey's superb solo goal which clinched the title at Goodison Park vs West Bromwich Albion which has been described as one of the best ever goals to win the league championship. He also helped Everton win the 1970 FA Charity Shield. =After Everton= In 1974 he left Everton to join Sheffield Wednesday, where he finished his playing career shortly afterwards. =England= Despite his success at club level Harvey only made one appearance for the senior England team; this coming in a UEFA Euro 1972 qualification game against Malta. =Honours= He played in the FA Cup winning team of 1966, scoring the winning goal in the semi-final against Manchester United.

He is a member of the Social Democratic Liberal Party. Early life Nawaikula is from Buca, Natewa, in Cakaudrove Province. He qualified as a lawyer at the University of Tasmania in 1985, and has specialized in laws related to native land and indigenous people. A strong supporter of conservative family values, he said that parents should take their children's upbringing and education seriously. After the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat, Nawaikula returned to his private practice as a lawyer and continued to involve himself with issues affecting indigenous Fijians. In June 2010, after returning from the 10th UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York, Nawaikula and many of the Paramount Chiefs of Fiji formed the Fiji Native Tribal Congress, a nonprofit and non government body aiming to protect and advance the rights of indigenous Fijians, as an indigenous group, and to negotiate with the government and concerned citizens in a manner that balances those rights with the individual rights and group rights of other citizens in Fiji and to champion human rights generally. Political career Nawaikula first ran for parliament as a candidate for the Conservative Alliance (CAMV) in a byelection in the Cakaudrove West Fijian Communal Constituency in 2005. The by-election has been called following the imprisonment of the incumbent, Ratu Vakalalabure (Ratu Osea's older brother), on charges related to his role in the Fiji coup of 2000. Nawaikula was declared elected unopposed on 22 June 2005 after the only other candidate, the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL)'s Ratu Osea Vakalalabure (Ratu Vakalalabure's younger brother), withdrew from the contest, thus averting the scheduled byelection. The CAMV had called on the SDL to withdraw its candidate on the basis of a coalition agreement between the two parties. Nawaikula was re-elected in the 2006 elections as an SDL candidate, following the merger of the CAMV and the SDL. He was subsequently elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. He lost the position when parliament was dissolved by the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. Nawaikula returned to Parliament as a candidate of the Social Democratic Liberal Party in the 2014 elections, the first since the 2006 coup. He was re-elected in the 2018 elections, winning 5187 votes.

It has a population of 24063 inhabitants, making Martos the fifth largest municipality in the province. The city is located on a western peak of the Sierra Jabalcuz mountain range. It belongs to the metropolitan Area of Ja√©n, of which it is considered to be the second most important city after the capital. Its economy is based on agriculture, in particular the cultivation of the olive tree. Also important are various industries, especially those related to the treatment of plastic.  History  The city has been linked to the Roman settlement of Colonia Augusta Gemella, and starting in the 8th century was ruled by the Moors under various Islamic states for over 500 years. \\"Torre del Homenaje\\" of the \\"Castillo de la Villa\\" In 1225, King Ferdinand III of Castile and Leon captured the city from the Moors and incorporated it into his kingdom. During the Middle Ages, Martos became a strategic place, and its defences were reinforced with the construction of numerous fortifications in the city. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Martos underwent significant economic and urban development (reflected in the city's architecture), in large part due to the wealth derived from the industrial production of olive oil. Martos thus became one of the most prosperous cities of eastern Andalusia.  Ecclesiastical history  Torre-Campanario de la Villa = Former diocese of Tucci = Around 250 AD, a bishopric was established in present Martos under the name Tucci, on territory from the suppressed Diocese of Iliturgi. It was a suffragan of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sevilla. In 350, it lost territory to establish the Diocese of C√°stulo (now also a titular see), which it regained at that bishopric's suppression around 400. In 715, it was suppressed to establish the Diocese of Beaza. Recorded bishops are * Rogato (675? ‚Äì 688?) * Teudisclo (693? ‚Äì ?)

Overton is on the north end of Lake Mead. It is home to Perkins Field airport and Echo Bay Airport.  History  Overton was originally settled in 1869 with Helaman Pratt serving as branch president. A regular LDS branch was organized there in 1883.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History of the Church (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1941) p. 665 In the 1880s, Overton was the location of the only store in the lower Moapa Valley and attracted people from neighboring localities who arrived in Overton to buy supplies. In the 1930s, the town of St. Thomas was submerged by water as Lake Mead was being filled, and the majority of its population relocated to Overton. After that, Overton developed as the main core of the business community in the lower Moapa Valley. It also hosted most of the social events in the area. In 1980, residents of Overton and the nearby town of Logandale approved a referendum on merging the two towns into the town of Moapa Valley. The Clark County Commission affirmed the vote, legally creating Moapa Valley on February 13, 1981. Geography Overton is located in Moapa Valley, northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The town features a landscape of mesas, foothills, and nearby Lake Mead. It is also the settlement closest to Valley of Fire State Park. Economy =Industry= Near Overton, there are deposits of magnesite, kaolin, and gypsum. Silica sand is also being produced. =Transportation= Former St. Thomas branch of Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad in Overton. Nevada State Route 169 connects Overton with Interstate 15 (exit 93) in the north and Lake Mead National Recreation Area in the south. South of Overton, the highway into Valley of Fire state park (formerly a part of Nevada State Route 169, decommissioned in 2001) branches off west. Overton is located on the former St. Thomas branch of Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad which runs along the Moapa Valley, from north to south. The construction of the branch started in 1911 from Moapa station, which lies on the main line between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. By March 1912, the construction was completed. In 1919, the railway was made a double track. In 1938 and 1939, the final six-mile segment leading to St. Thomas, which was submerged under waters of Lake Mead, was abandoned. The branch currently extends to the town southern outskirts, serving the gypsum plant. There is no passenger service, but there is freight traffic.

He is currently a cricket coach. Domestic career Born 16 December 1969, Morley, West Yorkshire, England, White was brought up in Australia, but later moved back to England, his country of birth, where he became Yorkshire's first-ever overseas signing. At the time Yorkshire still operated a policy of only employing cricketers born in Yorkshire, even though English counties could play up to two overseas players if they wished. Having played in Australia, White was not initially qualified to play for England when he returned. This led to Yorkshire listing him as an overseas player. At the start of his career, White was an all-rounder who batted right-handed and bowled right-arm off spin. In his twenties, he changed his style to become a fast bowler, after doubts were raised about the purity of his spin-bowling action. International career When Raymond Illingworth became the new Chairman of Selectors for the English cricket team in 1994, he wanted the England team to contain an all-rounder who could bat at number six, and bowl first-change. He selected his fellow Yorkshireman White for this role, much to the surprise of many media pundits and fans. By this time, White had been playing in England long enough to qualify for the national team, and he made his Test d√©but against New Zealand. His performances were inconsistent and he was dropped after eight matches. In 2000, he suffered a mystery blackout, waking up to find himself in a gutter in Scarborough.Petropoulos, Thrasy, White built for speed, 5 September 2000, BBC Sport. Retrieved on 30 August 2010. The incident suddenly revitalised him as a cricketer, and his county performances earned him a recall to the England team for the series against the West Indies. He had a successful series, contributing useful runs at numbers seven and eight, and becoming an important member of the pace-bowling attack, including dismissing Brian Lara for his first golden duck of his Test career. His bowling had improved to such an extent that he was capable of using reverse swing and reaching speeds of 90 mph off a short run-up. White played well on subsequent tours to the subcontinent, with his most notable achievements being 93 against Pakistan at Lahore in 2000 and 121 against India at Ahmedabad in 2001. The latter performance was his one and only Test century. His thirtieth and final Test Match was against Australia in the Fourth Test of the 2002‚Äì03 Ashes series. An injury to his side prevented him from playing in the Fifth Test, but he later recovered to play in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, his last appearance for the national team. White's Test career was distinguished by inconsistency: with the ball, he took just fourteen wickets in his first ten Tests, followed by two consecutive five- wicket draws, and then no more than a two-for in his next fourteen Tests, before finally bowing out with a dozen in the three Ashes matches against the Australians; with the bat, meanwhile, he failed on two occasions to reach double figures more than once over the course of nine innings, but nevertheless gave solid accounts of himself on the Asian subcontinent. \\"By the end,\\" wrote satirist Andy Zaltzman, \\"it was hard to work out if he had overachieved or underachieved with both bat and ball. Or done exactly as well as he should.\\"Zaltzman 2009. After the World Cup, bowling-related injuries began to take their toll on White, and he re-invented himself as a specialist batsman for Yorkshire. Always an aggressive shot-maker, keen to hook and drive the quicks, and hit the spinners into the deep, he added greater depth and consistency to his game. Domestic career In 2004, White was appointed captain of Yorkshire, and in 2005 led them to promotion from Division Two of the County Championship. However, he resigned as captain at the end of the 2006 season, having helped them to avoid relegation. In 265 first-class matches, up to the end of 2006, White had scored 11,949 runs at 32.91 with a best of 186, while his 341 List A one day games brought him 8,933 runs at 26.56, with a best score of 148. He took 395 first-class wickets at an average of 28.47, with a best of eight for 55, and another 337 scalps in the one day game at 25.02, with a best of 5 for 19. Family & After cricket White's sister, Andrea, is married to the former Australian international cricketer Darren Lehmann, who played together with White at Yorkshire for a number of years. White is a former President of the Royal Burton Agnes Cricket Club, until 2017 when he was replaced by Phil Tufnell.http://www.burtonagnescricket.co.uk/blog/president In 2012, White accepted a position on the coaching staff, at Hampshire County Cricket Club.

The Southern Gothic narrative follows a New Orleans hospice nurse who begins a job at a Terrebonne Parish plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house, its former inhabitants, and Hoodoo rituals and spells that took place there.  Plot  Caroline Ellis, a hospice aide, quits her position at a nursing home and is hired as the caretaker of an isolated plantation house in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. The aging matron of the house, Violet Devereaux, needs help looking after her husband Benjamin, who was mostly paralyzed by an apparent stroke. At the insistence of the family's estate lawyer, Luke Marshall, Caroline accepts the position. After Ben attempts to escape his room during a storm, Caroline investigates the house's attic, where Violet said Ben suffered his stroke; she uses a skeleton key which Violet gave her. She discovers a secret room filled with ritual paraphernalia. Caroline confronts Violet, who reveals that the room used to belong to two African American servants who were employed at the house 90 years before. The servants, Mama Cecile and Papa Justify, were renowned hoodoo practitioners; they were lynched after conducting a ritual with the owners' two children, from whom Violet and Ben later bought the house. Violet tells Caroline that they keep no mirrors in the house because they see reflections of Cecile and Justify in them. Caroline borrows a phonograph record from the attic: Conjure of Sacrifice, a recording of Papa Justify reciting a hoodoo ritual. Caroline surmises that Ben's stroke was caused by hoodoo, but believes that his paralytic state is a nocebo effect induced by his own belief, rather than something supernatural. Taking advice from her friend Jill, Caroline visits a hidden hoodoo shop in a nearby laundromat, where a hoodoo woman gives her tools and instructions to cure Ben. After she conducts the ritual, Ben regains some ability to move and speak and he begs Caroline to get him away from Violet. Caroline tells Luke she is suspicious of Violet, but he remains skeptical. They travel to a gas station that Caroline previously noted was lined with brick dust, which she was told is a hoodoo defense; supposedly, no one who means one harm can pass a line of brick dust. She asks one of the proprietors, a blind woman, about the Conjure of Sacrifice, which she learns is a spell wherein the caster steals the remaining years of life from the victim. Increasingly convinced of hoodoo's authenticity, Caroline fears that Violet will soon cast the spell on Ben. Caroline discovers that Violet is unable to pass a line of brick dust laid across one of the house's doorways, confirming her suspicions. She incapacitates Violet and attempts to escape the house with Ben, but the front gate is chained shut. Caroline hides Ben on the property and enters Luke's office for help. Luke, revealed to be Violet's accomplice, brings Caroline back to the house. Caroline escapes, gets into a fight with Violet, and violently pushes her down the stairs, breaking her legs in the process. With strategic use of brick dust, Caroline flees to the attic, calls 9-1-1 and Jill for help, and casts what she believes is a protective spell. Violet, having caught up with her, reveals she actually trapped herself inside a protective circle. Violet pushes a full-length mirror at Caroline, which reflects the original owner's daughter, then Violet, and lastly Mama Cecile. A recording of the Conjure of Sacrifice plays, and the two switch bodies. Violet (revealed to be Mama Cecile, who had been occupying Violet's body through the Conjure) wakes up in Caroline's body, and force-feeds Caroline (now in Violet's body) a potion that induces a stroke-like paralytic state like Ben's. Luke (actually Papa Justify) arrives upstairs, revealing that Mama Cecile and Papa Justify have been conducting the Conjure of Sacrifice on new people since their supposed deaths; they had swapped places with the two children just before the lynching. Because hoodoo is supposedly only effective on those who believe in it, Cecile and Justify had to wait for Caroline to come to believe in hoodoo through her own investigation. Emergency services arrive the next morning and take Caroline and Luke away, trapped in the paralyzed dying bodies of Violet and Ben; when Jill arrives, \\"Luke\\" tells her that the Devereauxes left the house to Caroline, ensuring that Cecile and Justify will continue to occupy the house. Cast Production The Skeleton Key was filmed at the Felicity Plantation, located on the Mississippi River in Saint James Parish, Louisiana.  Release  The Skeleton Key was released in the U.S. on August 12, 2005, after having received an earlier release date of July 29, 2005 in the United Kingdom. It grossed $92 million worldwide. In the U.S., it took in $16.1 million in its first weekend, reaching number 2 at the box office; the total US gross was $47.9 million. Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 38% of 149 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Thanks to its creaky and formulaic script, The Skeleton Key is more mumbo-jumbo than hoodoo and more dull than scary.\\" Metacritic rated it 47/100 based on 32 reviews. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw awarded the film three out of five stars, noting: \\"It's a pretty thankless role for poor John Hurt, and there are some plot holes. But there's some shrewd satire of racism as the modern south's persistent, dirty little secret and screenwriter Ehren Kruger's third act conjures up a neat little shiver.\\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times praised the film, calling it \\"tightly plotted and suspenseful enough to keep you guessing until the satisfying, unexpected end, which is worth suspending disbelief for,\\" adding that \\"Hudson holds her own among impressive company. Not that Hurt has a whole lot to do other than grab an occasional wrist and recoil at his face in the mirror, and the usually measured Sarsgaard oversells it a bit, but Rowlands takes to the part like a fly to a shucked oyster.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times criticized the film for its plot, describing it as \\"enjoyably inane,\\" and also noted that the film \\"indulges in almost every conceivable regional and [Southern Gothic] genre clich√©.\\" USA Today wrote that the film \\"employs intriguing camera angles to heighten some of the suspense. It's too bad the movie goes over the top and falls apart in the last third.\\" Stephanie Zacharek wrote in Salon: \\"Softley, working from a script by Ehren Kruger, puts so much care into layering moods and textures that he doesn't always scoot the action along as briskly as he should.\\" In The Seattle Times, Moira McDonald wrote that the film is \\"occasionally scary but more often silly.\\" In her review for The Austin Chronicle, Marjorie Baumgarten wrote: \\"Director Softley again shows his gifts for creating atmospheric milieus...Yet the movie, overall, lacks tension and suspense. In Film Journal International, Edward Alter wrote that, \\"Iain Softley (K-Pax) and cinematographer Dan Mindel make the most of the setting,\\" but concluded that the film was, \\"a paint-by-numbers supernatural thriller that's more interesting for its locations than for its story.\\" Jennie Punter in The Globe and Mail called the film, \\"stylishly made but disappointingly lightweight.\\" Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Jessica Reeves called the film \\"serviceable but ultimately disappointing\\". In his annual film guide, Leonard Maltin rated the film mediocre, stating that it was \\"well-produced and occasionally suspenseful, but populated by unpleasant characters and a story that moves too slowly.\\" In the annual DVD & Video Guide, Marsha Porter wrote, \\"A few good scares can't compensate for a sluggish pace, and the climactic twist comes as a surprise only because it doesn't make sense.\\" References External links  * Interview with John Hurt * Skeleton Key House-Outside Tour Category:2005 films Category:2005 horror films Category:2005 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American supernatural thriller films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Edward Shearmur Category:Films set in New Orleans Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Hoodoo (spirituality) Category:Films with screenplays by Ehren Kruger Category:Southern Gothic films Category:Gothic horror films Category:Body swapping in films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films about consciousness transfer Category:2000s supernatural films Category:Films directed by Iain Softley Category:2000s supernatural horror films ","title":"The Skeleton Key"},{"id":"2096044","text":"David Adam LaRoche (born November 6, 1979) is an American former professional baseball first baseman who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB).

It is the first novel featuring Polly O'Keefe and the O'Keefe family, a generation after the events of A Wrinkle in Time (1962). The plot concerning advanced regeneration research puts this novel in the science fiction genre, but it could also be described as a mystery thriller. Plot summary The plot centers on a young marine biology student named Adam Eddington, who travels to the remote island Gaea off the coast of Portugal for a summer job working for a famous scientist, Calvin O'Keefe. Even before he leaves JFK airport, Adam is approached by Carolyn (\\"Kali\\") Cutter, the beautiful, well-traveled daughter of a rich American industrialist living in Europe. She warns Adam against yet another passenger, Canon Tallis. Tallis is accompanying Calvin O'Keefe's eldest daughter, 12-year-old Polly O'Keefe, to Geneva, but bad weather and mysterious dangers derail those plans. Instead, Adam finds himself shepherding Polly on a short flight from Madrid to Lisbon. When Polly uses the restroom during the flight, she seems to disappear from the airplane completely, and the flight crew denies she was ever on board. Kali's father, Typhon Cutter, later enables Adam to rescue Polly from her kidnappers, deepening Adam's confusion about whom to trust. As the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that at least two different factions have equally strong but differently motivated interests in Dr. O'Keefe's research on organ regeneration. Adam faces a number of ethical dilemmas as he is forced to choose between these factions. Eventually Adam realizes that the O'Keefes are the ones who care about \\"the fall of the sparrow,\\" as their friend Joshua Archer puts it, a Biblical allusion to caring about others, even the seemingly weak and unimportant. Adam wants nothing further to do with Kali and her ruthless father, but the O'Keefes ask him to make a date with Kali anyway, so that Adam can act as a double agent, passing along fake research papers to the Cutters and smuggling the real ones out to trusted people in Lisbon. Adam reluctantly agrees. This plan is complicated, however, by Kali's unexpected claim that she has learned of her father's perfidy, and wants Adam to protect her and keep her confidences. Adam's attempt to do so makes it nearly impossible to pass on the real papers, hampered as he is by Kali's presence and spies from both sides. Eventually Joshua comes to Adam's rescue, but is shot dead; and Adam learns that Kali was acting on her father's behalf all along. The Cutters are arrested but have enough money to pay for their freedom. Later, Adam goes back to the Cutters' hotel to retrieve his passport from Kali. Playfully, she makes him chase her into the ocean, where she is attacked by a shark. Adam uses a special knife Polly gave him to fight off the shark and get Kali to shore. O'Keefe uses his experimental knowledge about limb regeneration to help Kali. Major characters =Adam Eddington= Intelligent, principled and a bit naive, 16-year-old Adam Eddington is a biology major who has been interning at Woods Hole, Massachusetts in the summers, until \\"Old Doc\\" Didymus sends him to work with Calvin O'Keefe instead. The Arm of the Starfish is Adam's first appearance in L'Engle's novels, and his only appearance in the O'Keefe series. He later appears in the Austin family novels A Ring of Endless Light and Troubling a Star. =Polyhymnia (\\"Poly\\") O'Keefe= 12-year-old Poly is red-haired, and describes herself as having measurements of \\"twenty, twenty, twenty.\\" Intelligent, inquisitive and loving, Poly speaks English, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, and Gaean. The Arm of the Starfish is Poly's first appearance, as such, but Meg Murry O'Keefe was pregnant with her at the time of A Swiftly Tilting Planet. Her unusual first name was bestowed on her by Canon Tallis, after which the O'Keefes did not allow him to name their other children. In later books, Poly begins to spell her name Polly to avoid awkward explanations about being named after Polyhymnia, the Greek muse of sacred music, and to keep people from pronouncing it with a long o. =Charles O'Keefe= Charles O'Keefe is Poly's eldest younger brother, the closest to her in both age and companionship. Quiet, thoughtful and empathic, Charles shows signs of having special mental abilities, much like Charles Wallace Murry, the uncle for whom he is named. =Canon John Tallis= Canon Tallis is a bald clergyman with no eyebrows, said to have lost his hair due to withstanding torture in Korea. Brusque and incisive, and not at all pious by L'Engle's definition, he defies the conventional image of a priest, and seems more than a little sinister to Adam at first. An Episcopal Canon, he is surprisingly adept (but not perfect) at navigating the dangerous waters of international intrigue. Canon Tallis reappears in the Austin family novel The Young Unicorns, where he is attached to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, the same cathedral where Madeleine L'Engle was writer in residence for many years. He also appears in the second O'Keefe family novel, Dragons in the Waters. Tallis is nicknamed \\"Tom\\" or \\"Father Tom\\" because of the historical composer Thomas Tallis, who wrote the Tallis Canon. =Dr. Calvin O'Keefe= Calvin O'Keefe is a marine biologist, husband of Meg, and the father of seven children, the eldest of whom is Poly. Calvin first appeared in A Wrinkle in Time, as a 14-year-old high school junior, a popular and athletic but neglected adolescent from a family with eleven children. As an adult, Calvin is a loving and attentive father. He was also an embasador. =Margaret (\\"Meg\\") Murry O'Keefe= Meg O'Keefe is the former Meg Murry, who rescued her father from the planet Camazotz in A Wrinkle in Time. As of The Arm of the Starfish, she is a scientist and mathematician (albeit without a doctorate) who assists Calvin with his work, while also helping to raise her large family. In contrast to her awkward adolescence, she is described as \\"a tall, strikingly beautiful woman\\" as an adult. Nomenclature Many of the characters in The Arm of the Starfish are named after Biblical or religious figures. The surname of the duplicitous Dr. Eliphaz Ball is initially misunderstood by Adam as Baal, a name given to a number of deities considered \\"false gods\\" by the Hebrews in ancient times. The name \\"Eliphaz\\" recalls the name of one of the comforters of Job; the Biblical Eliphaz believed that the righteous and just did not suffer, but that secret sins might be punished by God‚Äîa belief stated at the end of the Book of Job to be wrong. Canon Tallis is named after English liturgical composer Thomas Tallis, and of course the name Adam is from Genesis. The concierge at the Ritz Hotel is called Arcangelo. Doc Didymus shares a name with the Apostle Thomas as well as the ecclesiastical writer Didymus the Blind. There is even a special dolphin named after a famed 4th century Cappadoccian ascetic, Macrina, who apparently has two brothers Gregory (i.e. Saint Gregory of Nyssa) and Basil (i.e. Basil the Great of Caesarea). (The name Basil is later reused for another dolphin of Adam's acquaintance in A Ring of Endless Light.) Macrina's mended fin evokes the historical Macrina's scar, which her brother Gregory writes about in his Life of Macrina. Classical names used in the book include Polyhymnia, the fictional Portuguese island of Gaea, named for a Greek goddess associated with the Earth, and Typhon, the deadliest monster in Greek mythology and the legendary \\"Father of Monsters.\\" Finally, the names of Kali Cutter and Joshua Archer are significant. Kali is the name of the Hindu goddess of change, power and destruction, while the girl's surname indicates that she and her father have the power to cut (i.e., wound) others, both figuratively and literally. Joshua, by contrast, bears the Hebrew name of two Biblical figures: Joshua, a commander who fought at God's command, and Jesus. Reception At the time of the book's publication, Kirkus Reviews said, \\"As the conflict becomes more pronounced, the story gets weaker. The personal probe is valid although many may disagree with the answers, and it accompanies some solidly detailed, excitingly sustained adventure.\\" Robert Hood wrote in The New York Times, \\"Tense, tricky, well-plotted, 'The Arm of the Starfish' has all the stuff of which adult spy novels are made. From the moment you meet the 16-year-old hero, until the conclusion of his exotic adventures, the story moves like a missile to target.\\" Series notes The Arm of the Starfish is the first of four novels about Poly (later called Polly) and the O'Keefe family. The other three are Dragons in the Waters (1976), A House Like a Lotus (1984) and An Acceptable Time (1989). The Arm of the Starfish takes place about twelve to thirteen years after the events of A Swiftly Tilting Planet, the last of the Time Quartet of books about the Murry family. The Murry-O'Keefe books are said to take place in Kairos time, as opposed to Chronos or ordinary time. As such they cannot easily be pinned down as taking place in a particular year or even a particular decade. This is partly a problem of time continuity, arising from the fact that the books were written over a period of several decades. However, L'Engle's use of the term Kairos (which she describes inside the front cover of Many Waters as \\"real time, pure numbers with no measurement\\") suggests a religious connotation as well. The second generation O'Keefe books were written concurrently with the Time Quartet (eventually Time Quintet), with The Arm of the Starfish appearing just three years after A Wrinkle in Time. The final book in the O'Keefe series, An Acceptable Time, is also the final book of the Time Quintet. The Murry-O'Keefe books have further connections with other L'Engle titles. The Austin family books have three major crossover characters in common with the O'Keefe books, two of whom are introduced in The Arm of the Starfish. Canon Tallis meets the Austins in The Young Unicorns, which takes place a few months after Starfish. Adam Eddington meets Vicky Austin the following summer in A Ring of Endless Light, and Meg and Charles Wallace are mentioned in The Moon by Night. The Austin family series is associated with Chronos instead of Kairos.

She graduated with honors with a bachelor of arts degree in English literature. She was accepted to the doctoral program of Stanford University in Chinese and Japanese literature, and she intended to be an instructor in English literature. However, while at Stanford, Tong began her broadcasting career, getting what she thought would be a summer job as morning editor and producer for KPIX-TV All-News Radio in San Francisco. The summer job turned into a year-long stint at the radio station which was the top all-news station in San Francisco.Newton, Kathie. \\"Women: The new TV set Stars share a mystical 'something'\\", The Modesto Bee, March 25, 1980, p. A7. Tong managed to complete her master's degree in Asian studies but was sidetracked by the news business. Career Tong's television career began as a reporter for KPIX-TV in San Francisco, where she worked from 1976 to 1979. Originally hired as a writer for the station, Tong was asked to do an on-air test and was immediately promoted to a street reporter, where her first on-air story was a report on the new carts that transported people around the airport. In December 1979, she became co-anchor of the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts on KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California where she soon became number one-rated out of all the television news personalities in Sacramento. Referring to the difficulties of having a family and career, she said at the time: \\"Anchoring is fun. At one time I wanted to be a network reporter, but now I think that is too difficult a life. One of these days I want to have a baby.\\" In 1981, she moved to WABC- TV in New York City. Within two years, she became co-anchor of the station's 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, first with Tom Snyder from 1983\\"Kaity Tong's Bank Problem\\", New York Magazine, February 21, 1983. to 1984 and later with Ernie Anastos until 1986. She moved to the 6 p.m. newscast, rotating the anchor chair with John Johnson alongside Bill Beutel after Roger Grimsby was fired in 1986,West, Gary. Profile, MrPopCulture.com, April 24, 1986. while still co- anchoring the 11 p.m. broadcast with Anastos until he left for WCBS in 1989. Eventually her sole anchor role was the 11 p.m. news, as Beutel became solo anchor of the 6 p.m. broadcast. In 1984, she appeared as herself, reporting on the defection of the Soviet circus performer played by Robin Williams in feature film Moscow on the Hudson. She has also played a newscaster in Wolf, City Hall, Marci X, Night Falls on Manhattan, and 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate. Her firing from WABC-TV in 1991 caused considerable outrage. She was replaced by Susan Roesgen, who came from a small Midwestern station and who never adjusted to New York, lasting only a year on WABC-TV. A \\"Coalition of Asian-American New Yorkers\\" suggested that Tong's Chinese- American background was the reason. Other supporters of Tong cited her age, which was over 40 at the time, as a main reason for her firing. Station management stated that Tong was released due to her high salary which was $750,000 per year at the time (the equivalent to $1,353,965 in 2017). CPI Inflation Calculator Capital Cities/ABC chairman Thomas Murphy said it was \\"strictly a business decision.\\" According to Tong, her direct boss Channel 7 Vice President and General Manager Walter Liss acknowledged that Tong's newscast at 11 p.m. had the highest ranking in that time slot, but he wanted \\"...a much bigger No. 1\\", and had a vision of what the ideal look of how television should be in the 1990s. Tong declined to repeat specifically what Liss's vision was, other than to say, \\"I am trying hard to take the high road in all of this.\\"Diamond, Edwin. \\"New-Girl Network: Anchors get Younger and Blonder\\", New York Magazine, June 10, 1991, p. 21. In early 1992, Tong joined WPIX as the station's top female anchor and has been there ever since. She co- anchored the station's 10 p.m. newscast with Marvin Scott from January 1992 to September 1992, with Jack Cafferty from September 1992 to October 1998, and with Jim Watkins from October 1998 to 2010, when Watkins was fired.Tong, Kaity. \\"It's Our Anniversary! Jim and I celebrate 11 Years of Bliss...\\", KPIX Blog, July 21, 2009. She has since been weekend anchor for the station. Tong was involved in a 2010 lawsuit by former news director Karen Scott against WPIX for age discrimination when Scott and other veteran broadcast personnel lost their jobs, later testifying in court.Huff, Richard, \\"TV reporters reluctant to reveal age, fearful that experience could be used against them\\", New York Daily News, Friday, June 25, 2010 In January 2016, Tong returned to weekdays, co-anchoring a new 6:30 p.m. newscast alongside longtime WWOR anchor Brenda Blackmon.

He was the author of over 20 books on physics, scientific philosophy, and computer science. He conducted nuclear research at France's Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique (Atomic Energy Authority). Work Charon muses in his book The Spirit: That Stranger Inside Us (2004): \\"There are microscopic individualities inside every human. They think, they know, and (they) carry Spirit in the Universe.\\" Charon chooses to call these individual beings of intelligence, \\"eons.\\" They are otherwise known as electrons. Each electron or \\"eon\\" is an enclosed space, a thinking entity, intelligence, and even a micro-universe. But this is an inaccurate way of speaking about them, because as Michael Talbot warns us in The Holographic Universe (1991), \\"the only time quanta ever manifest as particles is when we are looking at them.\\" Thus, it would be more accurate to think of these beings in terms of wave interference patterns. \\"You are the 'spiritual intersection' of all these particles,\\" continues Charon \\"Your eons will remember you, your 'I,' for all their lives. They'll carry it with them in their future life‚Ä¶.And this future life in the body of eons will be very long, almost as long as the Universe itself.\\" Suggests Charon, \\"the electrons which form my body are not only carriers of what I call 'my' spirit, but, in fact constitute my spirit itself.\\" Electrons are sent individually into the Universe to learn and to increase the order of the Universe; \\"the psychic level of the whole Universe progressively elevates itself‚Ä¶during the 'successively lived experiences' of elemental matter.\\" The goal of each electron is to increase its energy to the highest level of sustainable excitement; that is, to contain the most information within the largest stable system of organization possible. The electron becomes part of increasingly more complex forms; living the life cycle of that form. At the death of that form, electrons leave the body, taking their informational energy with them. The goal of the electron is developing the order of its Spirit. There are four psychic forces that organize living forms into entities of increasing energy or order: reflection, knowledge, love, and action. As the order grows, so do the psychic properties. Ecstasy, says Charon, is the higher level of excitement felt when the electron fills one plane with photon energy, to the threshold at which it jumps to the next quantum level‚Äîignites, until the entire system is fully energized. \\"(A)n interaction of 'internal Love' exists among the electrons of our body, alongside the interaction of 'external Love,' between our electrons and those of 'others'.\\" By linking with the 'other' through love or knowledge, the electron increases its order and ability to hold organized energy. \\"It finally increases its spiritual faculties; its 'consciousness'‚Ä¶.To grow spiritually is to project more of our Love toward 'others'.\\" \\"Love is the simplest and most efficient process to increase negentropy (order) in the Universe.\\" Charon explains addiction to TV, computers, and music listening in terms of the attraction of our electrons to that which increases order and energy to their informational richness. It is an inbuilt desire to become part of that larger order. This also explains the phenomenon of mob mind. Selected writings * Charon, J-E. Theorie de la Relativit√© Complexe.

The song peaked at #18 in the UK. Background The ballad is considered a favourite among fans and is one of their most notable songs of this period. Brett Anderson has said on numerous occasions that he regards this song as not only the high-water mark of his writing partnership with Bernard Butler, but his favourite of all Suede songs. The song is one of several notable Suede songs including \\"So Young\\" and \\"Stay Together\\", which were inspired by Anderson's ex-girlfriend Anick. The B-side, \\"Modern Boys\\", appears as an album track in the US edition of Dog Man Star. The single also features a version of \\"Introducing the Band\\" by electronic pioneer Brian Eno. Another B-side, \\"This World Needs a Father\\" is the only Suede song to feature input from both Bernard Butler and Richard Oakes. While the band were putting the final touches to the album, producer Ed Buller felt that the song needed more work and offered new guitarist Oakes to play Hammond organ. Music video \\"The Wild Ones\\" music video was filmed in Dartmoor and was directed by Howard Greenhalgh. The band met Greenhalgh at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York on a promo trip, where he won best video for Soundgarden's \\"Black Hole Sun\\".

Quests often fall into several types, such as kill quests, gather quests, delivery/\\"fetch\\" quests, and escort quests. However, quests can include more than one mission, such as gathering something and transporting it somewhere. Quests can be linked together to form quest series or chains. In this manner, quests are used to provide the player with further background to the setting their characters are in. This mechanism is also used to advance any story or plot the game might have. Many types of quests are referred to as \\"sidequests\\". These are quests which deviate from the main plot and are not required to complete the game.  Overview  In the most general sense, a quest is a \\"hunt for a specific outcome\\", in contrast to simply winning a game. Typical quests involve killing a set number of creatures or collecting a list of specific items. Some quests may take only a few minutes or hours to complete, while others may take several days or weeks. Often, the larger the reward, the longer the quest takes to finish, and it is common for a quest to require characters to have met a certain set of pre-conditions before they are allowed to begin. Questing is a tool used in role-playing games to avoid putting players in a position where they only perform a repetitive action, such as killing creatures. Players may be performing this activity in order to gain new skills and progress to new areas, or to gain in-game money in order to buy new items, such as armor and equipment. This process, commonly known as \\"grinding\\", can slow down a character's progression in the game and ultimately limit the player's enjoyment. Having a number of quests for characters to tackle is seen as a way to provide variety, and to counter the need to grind in these types of games. A sidequest is an optional section of a video game, and is commonly found in role-playing video game. It is a smaller mission within a larger storyline, and can be used as a means to provide non-linear structures to an otherwise linear plot. As a general rule, the completion of sidequests is not essential for the game to be finished, but can bring various benefits to the player characters.  Types  = Kill quests = A kill quest sends the character out to kill either a specific number of named creatures, or a specific NPC (non-player character). These types of quests often require the character to bring back proof of their work, such as trophies, or body parts (boar tusks, wolf pelts, etc.). = Combo quests = The combo quest requires a player to attack certain enemies or structures with a combination of attacks until the required number of combos is reached. Enemies in these quests are usually either immortal or infinite in number, until the player is successful. At this point, the enemies would either be killed, or stop appearing. = Delivery quests = Another type of quest is the delivery quest, also known as a FedEx quest Mentions FedEx quest or fetch- carry quest. Mentions fetch and carry quest This involves the character being sent to deliver an item from one location to another. Sometimes, the character may need to collect the item first, instead of being handed the item to deliver when starting the quest. These quests are made challenging by asking the character to journey through unfamiliar or dangerous terrain, sometimes while facing a time limit. = Gather quests = Gather quests, also known as collection quests or fetch quests, require a character to collect a number of items. These can either be gathered from a location or environment, or require the character to kill creatures in order to collect the required items. The quest may also require the character to collect a number of different items, for example to assemble a device. This type of quest is often criticized for being tedious, and for padding the game's length. = Escort quests = The Escort quest is a combination of killing enemies to maintain the well-being of a non-player character (NPC), while exploring an area alongside that NPC. A typical escort quest would involve protecting a character as he or she moves through an enemy-infested area. A majority of the time, the quest will demand the player to slay multiple enemies to ensure the safety of the NPC.Walker, Jill. \\"A Network of Quests in World of Warcraft.\\" Second Person: Role-Playing and Story in Games and Playable Media. 2007 308. Escort quests can be beneficial, forcing the players to focus on a particular area in order to play out a scene or reveal a section of the plot. Escort quests can also be used to funnel a character from one location to another, leading the player along a route or path. However, problems with this type of quest can occur if the artificial intelligence controlling the NPC causes the NPC to behave in unexpected or unmanageable ways. Because many escort quests are often perceived as being poorly done, they are very unpopular amongst the gaming community. = Syntax quests = A phenomenon unique to text-based games, syntax quests depend on guessing the correct syntax to use to carry out a (typically simple) operation. = Hybrids = Elements from the above types can be combined to make more complex quests. For example, a quest could require that the player find the parts needed to assemble a specific weapon (Gather Quest), and then use these parts to kill a specific foe (Kill quest). Hybrid quests may also include puzzles and riddles.  Quest chains  A quest chain is a group of quests which are completed in sequence. Quest chains are also known as quest lines. Completion of each quest is a prerequisite to beginning the next quest in the chain. Quests usually increase in difficulty as a player progresses through the chain. The quests typically reveal a single plotline in stages that explain the reason for the quests. Quest chains can also start with opening or breadcrumb quests, in order to encourage characters to journey to a new area, where further elements of the quest chain are revealed. Through mechanisms like these, the setting of a particular location is explained to the player, with the plot or storyline being disclosed as the character progresses.

Its development was initiated by Netscape Communications Corporation, before their acquisition by AOL. It was based on the source code of Netscape Communicator. The development was spearheaded by the Mozilla Organization from 1998 to 2003, and by the Mozilla Foundation from 2003 to 2006. The project has been superseded by the SeaMonkey Internet suite (SeaMonkey was the original code name for the project), a community-driven Internet suite that is based on the same source code, and continues to be developed with the newer Mozilla codebase. The Mozilla Suite was composed of several main programs: Navigator (a Web browser), Communicator (Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups), a Web page developer (Mozilla Composer), an IRC client (ChatZilla) and an electronic address book. Also included were tools to synchronize the application with PalmPilot devices, and several extensions for advanced Web development, including the DOM Inspector, and Venkman (a JavaScript debugger). Versions 6 and 7 of the Netscape suite were based on the Mozilla Suite. The last official version is 1.7.13, as Mozilla Foundation is currently focusing on the development of Firefox and Thunderbird. The Mozilla Suite is available under the terms of the Mozilla project's tri-license, as free and open-source software. History and development Startup screen of the Mozilla Application Suite for Mac OS 9 featuring the Mozilla mascot In March 1998, Netscape released most of the code base for its popular Netscape Communicator suite under an open source license. The name of the application developed from this would be Mozilla, coordinated by the newly created Mozilla Organization, at the mozilla.org Web site. Although large parts of the original Communicator code, including the layout engine and front-end related codes, were abandoned shortly thereafter, the Mozilla Organization eventually succeeded in producing a full-featured Internet suite that surpassed Communicator in features, stability and degree of standards compliance. Under the AOL banner, the Mozilla Organization continued development of the browser and management of the Mozilla source until July 2003 when this task was passed to the Mozilla Foundation. The Foundation is a non-profit organization composed primarily of developers and staff from mozilla.org and owns the Mozilla trademark (but not the copyright to the source code, which is retained by the individual and corporate contributors, but licensed under the terms of the GPL and MPL). It received initial donations from AOL, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Red Hat, and Mitch Kapor. However, all official ties with AOL were severed following the announcement of the end of the Netscape Navigator browser and AOL's agreement to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser in future versions of its AOL software. AOL has since announced it will be using Mozilla's Gecko layout engine. According to the Mozilla development roadmap published on April 2, 2003, the Mozilla Organization planned to focus development efforts on the new standalone applications: Phoenix (now known as Mozilla Firefox) and Minotaur (now known as Mozilla Thunderbird). To distinguish the suite from the standalone products, the suite is marketed as \\"Mozilla Suite\\" or the more lengthy \\"Mozilla Application Suite\\". On March 10, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation announced that they would not release any further official versions of the suite beyond 1.7.x. However, the Mozilla Foundation emphasized that they would provide infrastructure for community members who wished to continue development. In effect, this means that the suite will still continue to be developed, but not by the Mozilla Foundation itself. To avoid confusing organizations that still want to use the Mozilla Suite, it was announced that the new, community-developed product would be named \\"SeaMonkey\\", with version numbers that start at \\"1.0\\". Features =Usability and accessibility= Mozilla supported tabbed browsing, which allows users to open multiple Web pages in the same browser window. Originally only available through the MultiZilla extension, the feature was then implemented directly within the browser. Mozilla also belonged in the group of browsers who early on adopted customizable pop-up blocking, and granular cookie management, including cookie prompts. The browser had a number of features which helped users find information. First, Mozilla had an incremental find feature known as \\"find as you type\\". With this feature enabled, a user could simply begin typing a word while viewing a Web page, and the browser automatically searched for it and highlighted the first instance found. As the user typed more of the word, the browser refined its search. Additionally, Mozilla supported the \\"custom keyword\\" feature. This feature allowed users to access their bookmarks from the location bar using keywords (and an optional query parameter). For example, using a custom keyword, a user could type \\"google apple\\" into the address bar and be redirected to the results of a Google search for \\"apple\\". For the mail and newsgroup component, the built-in Bayesian e-mail spam filter could effectively filter out unwanted e-mail spam after a period of training. =Customizability= Mozilla introduced the extension model, which was expanded and improved by Firefox and Thunderbird. Through extensions (installed via XPInstall modules), users might activate new features, such as mouse gestures, advertisement blocking, proxy server switching, and debugging tools. One can view the extension system as a ground for experimentation, where one can test new functionalities. Occasionally, an extension, or a part of it, became part of the official product (for example MultiZilla's tabbed browsing feature eventually became part of the standard Mozilla). Mozilla also supported a variety of themes/skins, which changed its appearance. Themes consisted of packages of CSS and image files. The Mozilla Add-ons Web site offered many themes. Beyond adding a new theme, users could customize its interface by adding and removing some of its buttons and toolbars. Additionally, Mozilla stored most of its preferences in a list that users could access by typing about:config in the address bar. Some preferences were only available through it, like turning on bookmark icons. =Standards support= The Mozilla Foundation took pride in Mozilla's compliance with existing standards, especially W3C Web standards. Mozilla had extensive support for most basic standards at the time including HTML, XML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, MathML, DTD, XSLT and XPath. Mozilla also supported PNG images and variable transparency, (which Internet Explorer only supported fully in version 7). Indeed, Internet Explorer's lack of support for PNG images has occasioned much debate, as many Web developers wanted to move away from the old GIF format, which does not have the same capabilities and image quality as PNG. Mozilla had implemented most of CSS Level 2 and some of the not-yet-completed CSS Level 3 standard. It was among the first browsers to pass the original Box Acid Test, although it doesn't fully pass the more rigorous Acid2 test for HTML, CSS, and PNG standards support. Other browsers based on newer versions of Mozilla's core technology, however, pass the Acid2 test. The mail and newsgroup supported POP and IMAP. It also supported LDAP address completion. Both reading and writing of HTML e-mails were supported. Mail files were stored in mbox format, and were thus portable. The first version of the suite, i.e., the one that formed the basis of Netscape 6, did not support the blink element, thus making it the only Netscape/Mozilla browser that has not supported the notorious tag that Netscape itself created. Later versions of the suite supported the element as well as the marquee tag, originally created by rival Internet Explorer. =Cross-platform support= Mozilla ran on a wide variety of platforms. Releases available on the primary distribution site supported the following operating systems: *Various versions of Microsoft Windows, including 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, and Vista. *Mac OS X *Mac OS 9 (discontinued after Mozilla 1.2.1, but an unofficial Mozilla 1.3.1 is available here ). However, an updated branch of the Suite survives for the classic Mac OS in the form of Classilla. *Linux- based operating systems using X.Org Server or XFree86 *OS/2, also known as Warpzilla Mozilla used the same format to store users' profiles (which contain their personal browser settings) even on different operating systems, so a profile might be used on multiple platforms, as long as all of the platforms could access the profile (e.g., the profile was stored on a FAT32 partition accessible from both Windows and Linux). This functionality was useful for users who dual-boot their machines. However, it might occasionally cause problems, especially with extensions. =Web development tools= Mozilla came with three Web development tools ‚Äî a DOM Inspector, Venkman and JavaScript Console. The DOM Inspector was not available in non-Mozilla browsers, and the JavaScript Console was more advanced than the consoles available in non- Mozilla browsers. Venkman was a difficult to use but decent JavaScript debugger. These were installed by default, though you could opt them out (except for the JavaScript Console) with the other install options. =Security= Mozilla was designed with security in mind. Among its key features were the use of the sandbox security model, same origin policy and external protocol whitelisting. One key characteristic of Mozilla security was that its source code is visible to everyone. Proposed software changes were reviewed by at least one other person, and typically \\"super-reviewed\\" by yet another, and once placed in the software were visible for anyone else to consider, protest, or improve. In addition, the Mozilla Foundation operated a \\"bug bounty\\" scheme: Users who reported a valid critical security bug received a US$500 cash reward for each report and a Mozilla T-shirt. The purpose of this \\"bug bounty\\" system, according to the Mozilla Foundation, was to \\"encourage more people to find and report security bugs in our products, so that we can make our products even more secure than they already are\\". Anyone in the world could report a bug. Also, access to the source code of Mozilla Firefox, internal design documentation, forum discussions, and other materials that could be helpful in finding bugs were available to anyone. The Mozilla Foundation has issued a security bugs policy to help contributors to deal with security vulnerabilities. The policy restricts access to a security-related bug report to members of the security team until after Mozilla has shipped a fix for the problem. This is intended to deter the exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities and give the developers time to issue a patch. While similar to other \\"responsible disclosure\\" policies issued by companies such as Microsoft, this policy is opposed to the full disclosure principle favored by some security researchers. As of June 2005, Secunia had reported three unpatched vulnerabilities in Mozilla with the most serious one marked \\"less critical\\". Market adoption and project end From 1998 to 2004, the global usage share of Mozilla grew from a negligible amount to about 3%. Because of the Foundation's plan to switch development focus to standalone applications such as Firefox and Thunderbird, many new features and enhancements were not available for Mozilla. This, combined with the community marketing effort named \\"Spread Firefox\\", drew more and more users away from Mozilla since late 2004, when Firefox 1.0 was released. There were no official releases of the Mozilla Suite beyond version 1.7.13. As of 2008, Mozilla Suite usage share was approximately 0.1%. SeaMonkey, a community-driven Internet suite that is based on the same source code, is pursued by those that appreciated Mozilla's feature set.

SWPC continually monitors and forecasts Earth's space environment, providing solar-terrestrial information. SWPC is the official source of space weather alerts and warnings for the United States. Description The Space Weather Prediction Center is one of the nine National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and provides real-time monitoring and forecasting of solar and geophysical events, conducts research in solar-terrestrial physics (i.e. heliophysics), and develops techniques for forecasting solar and geophysical disturbances. The SWPC Forecast Center is jointly operated by NOAA and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and is the national and world warning center for disturbances that can affect people and equipment working in the space environment. SWPC works with many national and international partners who contribute data and observations. A few of the agencies and industry that rely on SWPC services: * U.S. power grid infrastructure * Commercial airline industry * Department of Transportation (use of GPS) * NASA human space flight activities (NASA relies on SWPC data to protect the $1 billion arm on the International Space Station (ISS)) * Satellite launch and operations * U.S. Air Force operational support * Commercial and public users (more than half a million hits per day on SWPC web sites) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires dispatchers to take into consideration HF communication degradation for each dispatched polar flight.

The Republic claimed as its own the multi- ethnic territory of the Banat, in a bid to prevent its partition among competing nationalisms. Openly endorsed by the local communities of Hungarians, Swabians and Jews, the German-speaking socialist Otto Roth served as its nominal leader. This project was openly rejected from within by communities of Romanians and Serbs, who were centered in the eastern and western halves of the region, respectively. The short-lived entity was recognized only by the neighboring Hungarian Republic, with which it sought a merger. Its military structures were inherited from the Common Army, and placed under the command of a Hungarian officer, Albert Bartha. The Republic advocated the establishment of a Swiss cantonal model in Eastern Europe, and favored peaceful cooperation among ethnicities, as alternatives to partition. It had limited control of the country outside of Timi»ôoara: it never held Panƒçevo, which became the center of Serb self-government, and failed to fully control the Romanian cities of Lugoj and Caransebe»ô. Before the Hungarian armistice, the Banat was threatened with invasion by the French Danube Army. Roth's government also fought against a surge of peasant rebellions, and, though militarily weak, managed to quell uprisings in Denta, FƒÉget and CƒÉrpini»ô. In late November of 1918, the entire region was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia, which in December became the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, or colloquially Yugoslavia. Roth remained in place as governor, and the Republic continued to have nominal existence. The following year, in January, the French ultimately intervened in the region, to prevent a clash between Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Romania. The rump Republic was toppled on 20 February 1919, leading to significant violence. Roth escaped arrest and fled to Arad, where he was said to be in contact with the Hungarian Soviet Republic. He still proposed solutions for Banat's autonomy, including a plan to have the region absorbed into the French colonial empire. In 1920, the Banat was divided between Yugoslavia, Romania, and Regency Hungary. Banat separatist and federalist schemes continued to be drafted during the early interwar, being especially popular with Swabians. Before 1921, the idea of an independent Banat was taken up by the Autonomous Swabian Party and by Swabians of French descent; Romanians such as Avram Imbroane and Petru Groza were sympathetic toward minority rights and decentralization, but did not endorse autonomy. As far-left militants, Groza and Roth collaborated with each other throughout the interwar period. Swabian-centered autonomist projects were also taken up by Nazi Germany during World War II, resulting in the creation of a Nazified Banat; liberal Swabians such as Stefan Frec√¥t opposed this trend, and came to advocate full delimitation between French and German Swabians. After decades, separatist projects in the Banat reemerged in 2010s Romania, where they became associated with regional, rather than ethnic, identities.  Precedents  The Banat is a natural geographical region located on the left bank of the Danube, within the Pannonian plain and along the westernmost slope of the eponymous mountains. It was first organized into territorial units by the Old Hungarian Kingdom: the lowlands as counties, and the mountainous areas as a Banate of Severin. Interwar journalist Cora Irineu proposes that an early instance of \\"autonomous policy\\" in the eastern Banat stemmed from the weakness of the Hungarian crown, which had difficulty defending itself against the Ottoman Empire during a long series of incursions.Cora Irineu, \\"Scrisori bƒÉnƒÉ»õene\\", in Adriana Babe≈£i, Cornel Ungureanu (eds), Europa CentralƒÉ. Memorie, paradis, apocalipsƒÉ, p. 177. Ia»ôi: Polirom, 1998. Matthias Corvinus also organized the west into a separate \\"Captaincy\\", whose purpose was defend the border against the Turkish advances.Radonitch, p. 2 From 1552, most areas now regarded as the Banat were absorbed into a single Ottoman administrative unit, named Eyalet of Teme≈üvar. Before 1568, the east was an autonomous Banate of Lugos, administered by the Transylvanian Principality before most of it was folded back into the Eyalet. Upon emerging victorious in the Great Turkish War, the Habsburg Monarchy took over the region. In 1694, Serb settlers in the still-unnamed area obtained an imperial pledge granting them self-government, but this was never put into practice.Ceroviƒá, p. 51 After the 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz, the region became a Habsburg province called the Banat of Temeswar. Hungarian geographer S√°ndor K√≥kai considers it an early predecessor to the Banat, rendering plausible the Republic's claim to territorial and cultural coherence.K√≥kai, p. 74 According to the Serb medievalist Jovan Radoniƒá, it is at this stage that the region acquired its name, as it had \\"never before been one administrative unit\\".Radonitch, pp. 1, 3 This Banat was abolished in 1778, when its components were merged into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In the 1790s, the Serbs became divided between those who pressed for a separate territory and those who, like Sava Tekelija, argued in favor of Josephine centralism. The project of reserving Banat for Serb self-government was ultimately rejected by Leopold II.Ceroviƒá, pp. 75‚Äì79. See also Radonitch, p. 7 The status quo was challenged by the rise of Hungarian nationalism and liberalism. In 1834, mountainous eastern Banat hosted a Masonic Lodge which preached republicanism.Kakucs (2016), p. 476 These ideas were at the forefront of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, which proclaimed independence for the entire Kingdom, maintaining its hold on the Banat. A pro-Hungarian Serb, Petar ƒåarnojeviƒá, was assigned Commissioner in the Banat, tasked with imposing martial law against conservative rebels.Ceroviƒá, pp. 86‚Äì87 In parallel, the concept of a Romanian Banat was being advanced by Romanian radicals. One of these was Eftimie Murgu, who organized a popular assembly in June and proclaimed a \\"Romanian Captaincy\\" within revolutionary Hungary. This effort was mainly directed against the Habsburg (Imperial Austrian) regime; the Austrians found regional backing from the rival government of \\"Serbian Vojvodina\\", which aimed to incorporate the entire Banat.Albert, p. 450; Gh. Coto»ôman, \\"Eftimie Murgu »ôi Banatul la 15/27 Iunie 1848.‚ÄîAniversarea a 99 de ani de la istorica Adunare Na»õionalƒÉ din Lugoj\\", in Foaia DiecezanƒÉ, Vol. LXII, Issues 28‚Äì29, July 1947, pp. 1‚Äì5. See also Ceroviƒá, pp. 87‚Äì91 Between 1849 and 1860, the Banat, together with the Baƒçka and Syrmia, was part of a new Habsburg‚ÄìSerb province, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar; the shared capital of all these entities was Timi»ôoara. Seen as a \\"hybrid\\", this arrangement was not generally welcomed by Romanians.Albert, p. 450 However, a second experiment in Banatian autonomy was carried out after 1850, when the Austrians appointed ƒåarnojeviƒá's Aromanian son-in-law, Andrei Mocioni, as governor over the eastern half of the Voivodeship. This change was largely advantageous for the Romanian population, which controlled the administration, but ended in 1852, when Mocioni resigned over his conflicts with central government.Adrian Dehleanu, \\"Familia Mocioni. Istoria uneia dintre cele mai vechi familii nobiliare din istoria rom√¢nilor\\", in »öara B√¢rsei, Vol. XIV, Issue 14, 2015, p. 220 In November 1860, Mocioni organized a popular assembly, reissuing demands for a \\"Romanian Captaincy\\", but under Austrian supervision.Milin, p. 21; Tiron, p. 30 This action was not supported, and in December the region and the Voivodeship were folded back into the Kingdom of Hungary (or Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen). The Romanian focus shifted toward forming a separate crown land for the community, unifying the Banat with Transylvania and Bukovina.Vicen»õiu Bugariu, \\"Andrei Mocsonyi de Foeni\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 20/1931, pp. 399‚Äì400 The \\"Captaincy\\" project was revived in part by a coalition of Serb and Romanian deputies in the Hungarian Diet, including Svetozar Miletiƒá, Vincen»õiu Babe»ô, and Sigismund Popoviciu. During 1866, they proposed laws to redefine Hungary on the basis of ethnic federalism and corporatism.Milin, pp. 21‚Äì28 However, the Austro- Hungarian Compromise of 1867 cemented the Banat's annexation to the Lands of the Hungarian Crown, and kept the region under a unified government. This setback prompted Mocioni to withdraw from politics altogether.Tiron, pp. 30‚Äì31 Ethnic federalism was again redrawn in the 1900s by Aurel Popovici. However, his project, the \\"United States of Greater Austria\\", suggested the Banat's partitioning between a Romanian Transylvania and a rump Hungary, with a special status for Swabian-settled areas.Aurel Popovici, Stat »ôi na»õiune.

History  = Creation = Seal of the Losonczy Lodge The Banat issue was revisited during the final stage of World War I, with the collapse of Austro-Hungarian rule: the Aster Revolution toppled the Kingdom, and in mid November 1918 established a Hungarian Republic. In Timi»ôoara, the anti-war protests that began in early October grew in extent and intensity towards the end of the month, with several statues representing Austrian authority toppled by the populace. »òtefan Both, \\"Povestea Republicii BƒÉnƒÉ»õene, forma statalƒÉ care a supravie»õuit patru luni. A fost proclamatƒÉ de un avocat evreu la sf√¢r»ôitul Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial\\", in AdevƒÉrul (Timi»ôoara edition), 5 November 2017 The Banat state was actually proclaimed during one such popular assembly, on 31 October or 2 November.K√≥kai, pp. 67‚Äì68 Lieutenant Colonel Albert Bartha, who was attempting to organize a Hungarian front against the advancing French Danube Army, claims that he created the Republic as a buffer zone; he also records 31 October as the Republic's official birth date.K√≥kai, p. 67 Also that day, the Common Army split into National Committees representing the constituent nationalities. This was done by agreement between German Austria, still represented locally by Baron von Hordt, and the Hungarian National Council, represented by Alisp√°n Gy√∂rgy K√≥rossy.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 137 Other accounts credit initiative to Otto Roth, a member of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP).Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 137‚Äì139; K√≥kai, pp. 67‚Äì68 As reported by these, Roth, who had already served as Timi»ôoara councilor, met with his party colleagues on 30 October, and afterward approached Bartha. The process also involved local Freemasons, including two members of the Losonczy Lodge‚ÄîK√°lm√°n Jakobi and Istv√°n T≈ëk√©s.Kakucs (2016), pp. 483, 484 Roth acknowledged that he spoke on that night at the Military Casino, where he did not proclaim the republic, but rather expressed his support for the concept. Instead, he announced that Bartha was in charge of the city's military command, and asked for a People's Council to be formed.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 137.

Years later, Roth recalled being amazed that no Hungarian present moved to assassinate either him, for being a republican, or Cosma, for being a Romanian nationalist.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 137‚Äì138 The MSZDP local chapter organized the effort to create both the People's Council and subsequent Republican government, beginning with the large rally that had previously been announced in Timi»ôoara's Liberty Square. The participants flew socialist red flags.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 139‚Äì140 Eventually, an assembly of local politicians elected Roth \\"President of the Republic\\" and made Bartha, who was already head of the Military Council, commander of the Banat's military forces.K√≥kai, pp. 67‚Äì68. See also Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 139 Accounts converge on noting that the Republic was proclaimed from the balcony of Timi»ôoara City Hall.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 139; K√≥kai, pp. 67‚Äì68 The rally ended with renditions of Hungary's Himnusz and La Marseillaise.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 139 Also designated as Commissioner-in- Chief, Roth appointed sub-Commissioners in charge of the three traditional counties (Temes, Toront√°l, Krass√≥-Sz√∂r√©ny).Suciu, pp. 1092, 1102. See also Duda»ô, p. 359 Republican officials boasted that, by 4 November, they had already created a new administrative apparatus, as well as setting up a National Guard. The core of government was a 20-member Executive Committee, which proceeded to deal with the issues of supplies and famine.K√≥kai, p. 68 On 3 November, the Republic and its confederation with Hungary earned support from another Swabian popular assembly, whose chief organizer was Kaspar Muth.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, pp. 48‚Äì49 The state legislature was the same as the People's Council of Timi»ôoara, and included 70 members from the local Civic Party and other \\"bourgeois parties\\", 60 from the national military committees, 40 from the Workers' Council, and the entire 20-member Timi»ôoara city council.K√≥kai, pp. 63, 68 According to the Romanian author Gheorghe Iancu, in terms of individual affiliation, the Council was dominated by the MSZDP.Iancu, p. 62 As reported by Nova Zora newspaper of Vr≈°ac, this parliamentary body introduced tax brackets, forcing an individual tax of 400,000 Kronen on highest-income individuals.\\"Republica bƒÉnƒÉ»õeanƒÉ\\", in Glasul Cerbiciei, Vol. III, Issue 4, 2009, p. 9 Though anti-Habsburg, Hungary's own republican regime, headed by Mih√°ly K√°rolyi, sought to preserve as much as possible from the older Kingdom's territory, and to resist the advance of competing Romanian and Serb nationalisms within its borders. Although Hungarian troops withdrew from the area, Bartha was recognized as K√°rolyi's commissioner, and the Banat continued to be represented in Budapest by J√°nos (Johann) Junker. While Roth's proclamation is sometimes rendered as a declaration of independence,Ceroviƒá, p. 151; Minahan, p. 64 Republican officials openly acknowledged that their ultimate plan was to create a federal and democratic Hungary, with units modeled on the Swiss cantons.Heka, pp. 114‚Äì115, 126; K√≥kai, p. 68 A specific proposal for a Swabian \\"national canton\\" was advanced in December 1918 by Miksa Strobl.Heka, pp. 114‚Äì115 Roth's polity is occasionally referred to as \\"Banat autonomous republic\\",Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 48; Iancu, p. 62; Kakucs (2014), p. 365 or as a \\"limited autonomy within the Magyar state\\". Croat scholar Ladislav Heka sees the Republic as resulting from an alliance between Hungarians and Swabians; he also notes that the Bunjevci, a Slavic Catholic community in neighboring Baƒçka, also preferred Hungarian rule to some extent.Heka, p. 126 Several Romanian and Serb historians agree that Hungarian designs were the main drivers behind the establishment of a Banat Republic, which they see as a proxy for Hungarian rule: \\"Mih√°ly K√°roly's government desired a 'Banat autonomous republic' within a Magyar state [...], earning intense propaganda support from the Timi»ôoara lawyer Otto Roth and from other Magyar, German and Jewish intellectuals.\\"Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 48 Ion D. Suciu proposes that the republic was a \\"parody\\" and a \\"final diversion\\" in K√°roly's attempts to maintain control over the area.Suciu, pp. 1091‚Äì1092, 1102 According to Ljubivoje Ceroviƒá, \\"the leaders of the Banat Republic aimed primarily at ensuring Hungarian [territorial] integrity\\".Ceroviƒá, p. 151 As noted by researcher Carmen Albert, the \\"so called 'Banatian republic'\\" remains a mysterious detail in regional history, but could be regarded as \\"essentially anti-union\\", in that it opposed Greater Romania.Albert, p. 449 = Internal conflicts = According to estimates by S√°ndor K√≥kai, the Republic sought to cover \\"one of Europe's most complex areas\\".K√≥kai, p. 64 The region was home to 1.58 million people; of them, 592,049 (37.42%) were Romanian, 387,545 (24.50%) were Swabian or other German, 284,329 (17.97%) were Serbs, and 242,152 (15.31%) Hungarian, with 4.8% belonging to \\"fourteen smaller ethnic groups\\". 855,852 (54.10%) belonged to the Eastern Orthodox churches, while 591,447 (37.38%) were Catholics.K√≥kai, pp. 64‚Äì66 Relying on similar data, historian Mircea Rusnac argues that the Republic could claim to represent some 47% of the population, namely those to whom the Serbs and Romanians afforded no say regarding the region's future. Roth himself belonged to a minority: he was of Jewish origins, but did not practice Judaism.Br√Ænzeu, pp. 69, 229 His government was primarily backed by Hungarian and German workers, and found core support among the Swabian Catholic intellectuals. Roth's policies were contested from within the Republic's nominal territory by Cosma and the Romanian National Party (PNR), who proceeded to organize for Banat's merger into Greater Romania.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 48; Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 137‚Äì141; Suciu, p. 1092 This caucus held its own rally in Liberty Square, demonstrating the numerical strength of its following and performing the Romanian nationalist anthem. Its importance was acknowledged by Roth, who recalled that \\"the streets trembled with the lockstep of [Cosma's] powerful guards\\".Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 141 The core events of Romanian resistance to the Republic closely followed the developments in Timi»ôoara. After a meeting of the Romanians in Re»ôi»õa on 31 October, a \\"National Council\\" and a self-defense force were created, co-opting some Romanian members of the MSZDP. This was later transformed into a \\"Workers' Council\\", presided upon by Petru B√¢rnau.Suciu, p. 1096 Meanwhile, Re»ôi»õa's mostly German and Hungarian workers celebrated the Republic at a public rally on 1 November. On 3 November, Valeriu Brani»ôte hosted at Lugoj a large assembly of Romanians, who validated Cosma's efforts and also voted for the creation of Romanian military units. These issues were again raised and endorsed at another assembly, held at Caransebe»ô on 7 November.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 135‚Äì136, 143‚Äì145; Suciu, pp. 1092‚Äì1095 The city hall here was topped by the Romanian tricolor.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 135‚Äì136 Hungarian presence disintegrated in eastern Banat, with leftover authorities complaining that Romanians had read the \\"People's Government policy\\" as authorizing secession in majority-Romanian localities.Tomoni, p. 292 However, Caransebe»ô continued to host two parallel Councils: a Republican one, created by Zsolt R√©thy, and a Romanian one, under Remus Dobo.Kakucs (2014), p. 352 A Serb National Council had already been set up in Timi»ôoara during the earliest days of the Republic. Presided upon by Svetozar Davidov and Georgije Letiƒá, this assembly largely refused cooperation with Roth's Commissioners, only recognizing them as an ad-hoc city government; it demanded that Allied Powers occupy the Banat \\"as soon as possible\\".Ceroviƒá, pp. 152‚Äì153 On 5 November, Banat Serbs created another dissident National Council, at Panƒçevo. On 10 November, the two Councils, alongside other Serb bodies, sent delegates to the Popular Assembly which voted for the Banat's immediate union with the Kingdom of Serbia.Ceroviƒá, p. 153; Heka, p. 115 However, Roth was able to create disunity between the Bunjevci and other Slavs: on 7 November, a \\"Bunjevac People's Republic\\" was proclaimed at Sombor as a close ally of the Banat Republic. According to his own recollections, Bartha began separate negotiations with the French, falsely claiming that he had 40,000 soldiers prepared to resist them. In reality, he acknowledged, there were less than 4,000.K√≥kai, p. 67. See also Heka, pp. 125‚Äì126 His rivals Cosma and Lucian Georgevici had set themselves the goal of creating Romanian military units in each small locality; they reported 60,000 recruits in Temes alone.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 140‚Äì147 However, all competing sides had limited control over rural areas: peasants and returnees from the Common Army took over control over the villages and established over 40 independent councils.Kakucs (2014), p. 352; Suciu, p. 1097 Already in October, the Timi»ôoara Citizens' Guard, comprising paramilitaries of all nationalities, fought and defeated groups of liberated prisoners, restoring legitimate control over the Central Post Office.Kakucs (2014), p. 365 Many Serbs who had been prisoners of war in Russia returned home with military training, social grievances, and communist beliefs. Known as \\"Octobrists\\", they joined up with deserters and outlaws (\\"green cadres\\") and began raiding in Clisura area.Ceroviƒá, pp. 150‚Äì151 Coriolan BƒÉran, who took charge of the Romanian guards in S√¢nnicolau Mare, made note of a conflict opposing Romanians to the Banat Bulgarians of St√°r Bi≈°nov.Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, p. 143 A social revolt was sparked on 1 November, when the sugar mill of Margina, northeast of Lugoj, was taken over by peasants from the surrounding region; another nucleus was at Ciacova, south of Timi»ôoara.Suciu, pp. 1097‚Äì1098. See also Tomoni, pp. 291, 293, 297‚Äì299 Former soldiers directed repression against the notaries public, identified as responsible for wartime injustice. Such incidents peaked at Ghilad, where one notary was tried and executed by a self-appointed court, and again at Denta, where the archive was devastated and its curator seriously injured.B√ºchl, pp. 252, 253 The mayor of Bunya (now FƒÉget) was murdered, and the schoolteacher and priest were chased out.Tomoni, p. 291 The rebel groups also organized looting against landowners of all nationalities‚Äîincluding attacks on the Mocioni family estate at Birchi»ô,Suciu, p. 1097 the Bissingen- Nippenburg residence in Vojvodinci,Moscovici, p. 243 and G√©za Szalay's manor in Voiteg.B√ºchl, p. 252 In that context, Roth's Republic resorted to applying martial law. Its National Guard attempted to repress the peasant movement, notably at Jebel, where 17 were killed in the confrontation. Government remained largely powerless, but its task was taken up by loyalist troops from Timi»ôoara. At Margina, they reportedly relied on 33 mercenaries employed by the sugar industry, who resorted to terrorizing the population.Tomoni, pp. 293, 297‚Äì299 On 4 November, loyalist units stormed into Denta and CƒÉrpini»ô, executing some tens of looters.B√ºchl, p. 253 The same day, a Hungarian Guard intervened against anti-Jewish rioters in FƒÉget, killing as many as 16 Romanians.Tomoni, pp. 291‚Äì292 According to Romanian priest Traian BirƒÉescu, the 3rd Honv√©d Regiment, serving the Republic, committed wanton atrocities in FƒÉget, Racovi»õa, and TopolovƒÉ»õu Mare. He counts 160 victims of such incidents, between 3 and 17 November.BirƒÉescu, p. 185 During that same interval, the Republic's National Guard grew to incorporate the new arrivals, numbering at some 500 per district. There were open clashes between these units and their Romanian counterparts: the occupation of FƒÉget was only relieved when Axente Iancu and Dinu Popescu established and armed a Romanian Guard which ordered Republican troops to leave town.Tomoni, pp. 293, 294 Another enduring rebellion was that of Serb villagers in Kusiƒá and Zlatica, who established their own \\"Soviet republic\\" with assistance from the \\"Octobrists\\". = Serbian incursion = Following the Hungarian armistice, which allowed the Allied Powers to seize portions of Hungary, Bartha resigned in protest. On 12 November,Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 48; Duda»ô, p. 359; Suciu, p. 1101. See also K√≥kai, p. 68 the Royal Serbian Army entered the Banat with endorsements from both Hungary and the Allies. A force led by Colonel ƒåoloviƒá took control of Timi»ôoara on 17 November, being acclaimed by all communities as a guarantee of \\"freedom and democracy\\". Both Cosma and Roth spoke on the occasion, saluting the intervention; Roth greeted ƒåoloviƒá with the slogan \\"Long live internationalism!\\"Ceroviƒá, pp. 154‚Äì155 On 16‚Äì17 November, the National Guard of the Republic was disbanded, and, according to BirƒÉescu, \\"hundreds of Romanian peasants\\" were set free from Republican jails. Roth was technically confirmed as civilian governor, and the People's Council remained in place as a regional legislature.Moscovici, pp. 242‚Äì243 Government instructed the Banat's citizens to remain calm when interacting with the intruders, and from 16 November \\"existed only on paper\\".K√≥kai, pp. 68, 69 Anastas Bocariƒá's depiction of the Serb Popular Assembly in Novi Sad By 20 November, Serbian forces had camped along the Mure»ô River, from Szeged to Lipova.Duda»ô, p. 359; K√≥kai, pp. 68‚Äì69; Moscovici, p. 242; Suciu, p. 1101 In their advance eastwards, they stopped at Caransebe»ô and Or»ôova.Moscovici, p. 242 Serbian garrisons disarmed the surviving Guards of Timi»ôoara and Re»ôi»õa, while forcing the two Lugoj Councils to establish a single Guard unit.Kakucs (2014), pp. 352, 357, 365. See also Duda»ô & Grune»õeanu, pp. 143, 146‚Äì147 The \\"Octobrist\\" republic of Kusiƒá‚ÄìZlatica, whose leaders had attempted a march on Bela Crkva, was also repressed during the interval. The general purpose of this offensive was to secure as much of the region as possible before the Paris Peace Conference, obtaining the most favorable terms for the region's split between Serbia and Romania.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 49; K√≥kai, pp. 69‚Äì71; Moscovici, p. 242 Serbia regarded the Banat under its control as an acquired territory, part of a province called Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja. On 25 November, this view was enforced by the all-Slav Popular Assembly of Novi Sad. It hosted 72 Serb, Bunjevci, Slovak, Montenegrin, ≈†okci and Krashovani deputies from throughout the disputed areas.Ceroviƒá, pp. 155‚Äì156, 157‚Äì158 Non-Slavs were excluded on principle, though not entirely absent‚Äîwith the exception of Romanians, who boycotted this rally.Heka, p. 116 Some Romanians were by then driven out by the Serbian intervention. They include BƒÉran, who began organizing Banatian guards from Transylvania, as well as Caius Brediceanu and Ioan S√¢rbu, who asked for the French to step in as peacekeepers.Moscovici, p. 245; Suciu, p. 1101 Romanian peasants were originally sympathetic to the Serbian administration, as Serbia and Romania were both in the Allied camp. However, requisitions, overhunting, abuse against property owners, and conflicts over the reemergence of Hungarian Gendarmes sparked a number of conflicts between the occupied and occupiers.Albert, pp. 451‚Äì456 Also on 12 November, the local Romanian community aligned itself with the Central Romanian National Council (CNRC) of Transylvania, which was becoming the main ethnic representation body. Iosif Renoi, a Romanian member of the MSZDP and a resident of Boc»ôa, was elected on the CNRC leadership board.Suciu, pp. 1095‚Äì1097 During November, together with the other Council delegates and a number of sympathetic Swabians, Banat Romanians participated in negotiations with K√°roly's representative, Oszk√°r J√°szi. The CNRC issued demands for the whole territory of the Banat Republic to be annexed by Romania, alongside the counties of Csan√°d and B√©k√©s; J√°szi replied with promises of cantonal federalism within a \\"new democratic country\\".K√≥kai, pp. 70‚Äì71. See also Heka, pp. 126‚Äì127 Talks were suspended without a resolution, prompting the CNRC to call for a Romanian national assembly at Alba Iulia, Transylvania, on 1 December.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 49 To avoid antagonizing the Serbian administration, elections for the assembly were not held in the Banat, which was advised to send only informal representatives \\"from all social classes\\".Suciu, p. 1099 Some 182 of these were present for the vote, despite the Serbian Army's attempts to block access.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, pp. 51‚Äì52.

This polarization also divided the Swabian voters, between those who favored the Romanian option and those who acted in favor of a Yugoslavian project. The pro-Romanian lobby was enforced by Transylvanian Saxons, in particular the writer Viktor Orendi-Hommenau.Moscovici, p. 245; Suciu, p. 1103 The latter had established a Swabian cultural and political club, Kultur der Schwaben.Moscovici, p. 245 In parallel, Kaspar Muth continued to press for an autonomous republic, and, in January 1919, set up the Autonomous Swabian Party.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 51 = Clampdown = The Banat buffer zone, superimposed over the three subsequent partitions of the Banat: Romanian in blue, Serb in red, and Hungarian in green A small French presence in the Banat had been established in parallel with the Serbian occupation: French and African patrols, coordinated by Fran√ßois L√©on Jouinot-Gambetta, were stationed just outside Timi»ôoara, and in places such as Igri»ô and Vojvodinci. On 3 December, after tensions between Romania and Yugoslavia had escalated and threatened to erupt into a regional war, 15,000 French troops answering to Generals Paul Prosper Henrys and Henri Berthelot occupied Timi»ôoara.K√≥kai, pp. 69, 72 On 18 December, the Swabians' German National Council reemerged and openly asked for its own military self-defense units, or Volksmiliz. These were to be directly modeled on the Swiss Armed Forces.Kakucs (2014), pp. 347‚Äì348 Romanian community leaders and Orendi-Hommenau's followers celebrated the French intervention, but, by January, came to fear that France was tolerating another buildup of Yugoslavian forces.Moscovici, pp. 245‚Äì246 Jouinot-Gambetta, who was assigned command over the French troops in the Republican capital, came to be disliked by the Romanian community there, being widely perceived as a Hungarophile; by contrast, local Magyars experienced a surge of Francophile sentiment.Moscovici, pp. 243‚Äì244 Berthelot was finally persuaded by the Romanians to demand that most Yugoslav troops withdraw from the central and eastern portions of the Banat.Moscovici, pp. 246‚Äì249 On 25 January, L√©on Gaston Jean-Baptiste Farret and the 11th Colonial Infantry Division were in charge of Krass√≥-Sz√∂r√©ny.Moscovici, p. 248 By 27 January, French soldiers had full control over the eastern Banat, establishing a buffer zone centered on Timi»ôoara. Roth preserved power, having been reconfirmed by Jouinot-Gambetta.Pi»õigoi, p. 11 The city was not entirely relinquished by the Yugoslav side. In parallel to the French advance, the new Royal Yugoslav Army, under General Grujiƒá, consolidated a presence in Timi»ôoara.Moscovici, p. 249 By then, the rump Republic and the Serb Council had become foes. The Council's newspaper, Srpski Glasnik, commented that Roth was a \\"chameleon\\" in politics, bringing up evidence that he was plotting a pro-Hungarian coup.Ceroviƒá, p. 157 On 20 February, the German National Council and the remaining executive institutions of the Republic were dissolved. One version of the events credits the French with having taken this decision.Suciu, pp. 1101‚Äì1102 Another account informs that the Yugoslav contingent in Timi»ôoara was behind the move, and mentions that fighting occurred between the Serbs and the Republican National Guard.K√≥kai, p. 72. See also Iancu, p. 62; Moscovici, p. 249 Timi»ôoara's commander was by then the Swabian Josef Geml, who refused to recognize Yugoslavian rule from Novi Sad, leaving the city exposed to threats of a retaliatory blockade. On 21 February, in territories they still controlled, Yugoslav commanders began replacing the Republican bureaucracy with their co-nationals.Ceroviƒá, pp. 151, 155‚Äì157; Iancu, pp. 62‚Äì63; Moscovici, p. 249 From the Yugoslav point of view, Roth's replacement was Martin Filipon, who was both Timi»ôoara's Mayor and the regional ≈Ωupan.Ceroviƒá, pp. 156‚Äì157 In his sectors, Berthelot allowed Hungarian civilian administrators to resume their work for the duration of French rule, and proceeded to ban all other national councils, as well as displays of nationalist flags.Suciu, p. 1103 The K√°rolyi government attempted one final time to reassert control over the region in appointing an Alisp√°n for Krass√≥- Sz√∂r√©ny. Following Romanian protests, this move was vetoed by the French.Suciu, p. 1102 Protests and strikes followed soon after Roth's toppling from power. Timi»ôoara's German and Hungarian workers asked the French to intervene against the consolidation of a \\"Serbian empire\\" and to preserve the armistice agreement. Pursued by the Yugoslavs, Roth found refuge with the French garrison in Arad. The following period restructured Swabian political camps: Muth's initial option for Hungary was widely discredited when, in March, K√°rolyi fell from power and a Hungarian Soviet Republic was established. Meanwhile, Reinhold Heegen, replacing Filipon as Serbian- appointed Mayor of Timi»ôoara, began campaigning with some success for the Banat to join Yugoslavia, and promised that Swabians would own a university of their own.K√≥kai, p. 72 While Muth himself switched to the Yugoslavian plan, most of his colleagues became supporters of Greater Romania. Roth allegedly aligned himself with the Hungarian Soviets,K√≥kai, p. 73 although, by his own account, he was their ideological enemy.Br√Ænzeu, p. 76 He also introduced another political solution, presented by him in direct talks with French officials: he proposed an \\"independent Banat under French protection\\", and suggested its subsequent inclusion into the French colonial empire.Suciu, p. 1102. See also K√≥kai, p. 73 The French Ambassador in Yugoslavia, Louis Gabriel de Fontenay, rejected the plan altogether, and in particular its claim that Romanians also favored independence.Suciu, pp. 1102‚Äì1103 In the meantime, Swabian delegations presented Berthelot with a request for union with Romania; this was formally endorsed on 15 April, when all Swabian group leaders met in Timi»ôoara. On the Romanian side, a new version of Banatian regionalism was reemerging from nationalist groups opposed to the PNR: in mid 1919, a National Union from Banat, led by Avram Imbroane and Petru Groza, rallied support for that cause.Marin Pop, \\"Activitatea organiza»õiei Partidului Na»õional Rom√¢n din jude»õul Timi»ô √Æn primii ani dupƒÉ Marea Unire (1919‚Äì1920)\\", in Arheovest I.

That city was allowed to fly the Romanian tricolor.Suciu, p. 1104 As reported by √âmile Henriot, Timi»ôoara Swabians were generally in favor of this development, though a minority supported independence for the Banat and Baƒçka as a federal state. Their faction preferred incorporation into Hungary, but viewed emancipation as a next-best solution. Such groups also referenced the Swiss model, but did not want French tutelage; they preferred an American occupation. During the remaining months of French occupation, however, various Republican officials were again employed by the administration. In autumn 1919, T≈ëk√©s of the Losonczy Lodge became Alisp√°n of Temes.Kakucs (2016), p. 484 Republic of Banatia, as proposed by Swabians in April 1920 The project of making the Banat into an independent buffer state was aired in early 1919 by George D. Herron, an American socialist and pacifist. French diplomats gave some support to Herron's designs, a matter which aggravated Franco‚ÄìRomanian relations.Pi»õigoi, p. 14 On 16 April 1920, Swabian activists submitted to the Peace Conference another failed proposal for Banatian‚ÄìBaƒçkan independence, specifically referencing the Swiss cantonal model. The \\"neutral and independent republic of Banatia\\" was mostly embraced by Swabians of French (Lorrain) descent, who also proposed a separate canton for their subgroup.Vultur, p. 19 By then, however, the Franco-Swabian Stefan Frec√¥t had joined efforts with Michael Kausch and created a \\"German‚ÄìSwabian People's Party\\" (DSVP), which competed with Muth's Autonomous Swabian Party.Panu, p. 124. See also Narai (2008), pp. 311‚Äì312 Muth and Imbroane both won seats in Romania's Lower Chamber during the race of May 1920.

It wanted the entire region merged into Romania, but this proposal was not followed through.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 51; Duda»ô, pp. 360‚Äì361; Vultur, pp. 45‚Äì48 In parallel, the DSVP and the Autonomist Party dissolved into the German Party, which had reconciled with Romanian centralism and was acting as a shared caucus for all Germans of Romania; the German National Council was renamed Community of the German Swabians, and survived as such to 1943.Panu, pp. 119, 124‚Äì125.

See also Colta et al., pp. 222‚Äì223 = Later echoes = During World War II, Nazi Germany involved itself in endorsing regional government for the Swabians. In Romania, it promoted Swabian identity as a Nazi construct, prompting a major split between the Swabians-proper and descendants of the Banat French; the latter were led by Frec√¥t.Duda»ô, pp. 361‚Äì363; Vultur, pp. 15‚Äì16, 19, 45‚Äì52 In November 1940, under a friendly National Legionary State, Germany obtained the creation of an autonomous organism, or \\"German Ethnic Group\\", which was entirely Nazified.Duda»ô, p. 362; Narai (2008), pp. 314‚Äì315; Vultur, p. 19 This arrangement was maintained under Germany's subsequent ally, Ion Antonescu, though the Ethnic Group itself came to be secretly monitored by the Gendarmes.

During the subsequent interval, much of the Swabian population was lost, as a number left as refugees along with the retreating German army, while many of the ones left were the target post-war expulsions. In the easternmost counties, some 7,000 Swabians were deported as labor conscripts in the Soviet Union.Narai (2008), pp. 327‚Äì329 Although many refugees and deportees were accepted in West Germany, 10,000 of those identified as French, having left the Banat by 1945, were relocated to France.Vultur, pp. 12‚Äì14, 17‚Äì18 In Cara»ô, the Social Democrats clashed with the Soviet occupation forces, demanding that they end their anti-German abuse. Groza, by then the Prime Minister of Romania, favored a degree of segregation between the Romanians and Swabians, but praised the latter for their socialist traditions, and proposed to have them merge into the urban proletariat.Narai (2008), p. 318 Soviet presence peaked with the establishment of a Romanian communist state in 1948. During its early stages, this new regime redesigned the administrative map, and by 1952 had re- amalgamated the Romanian Banat into Regiunea Timi»ôoara. From 1956, the unit was extended northwards, incorporating parts of Arad Region.Colta et al., p. 76 The advent of Romanian national communism in 1960 was initially signaled by the renaming of territorial units with their more traditional form: the creation of Regiunea Banat was welcomed as a sign of \\"re- Romanianization\\"Cioroianu, pp. 217‚Äì218 and \\"partial return to the traditional forms of administrative organization\\".Colta et al., pp. 76‚Äì77 Within eight years, the larger units were folded back into counties by the national- communist leader, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu.Buruleanu & PƒÉun, p. 73; Colta et al., p. 77 The nationalist drive later came with renewed suspicion toward autonomy movements, and toned down internationalism. In 1972, an article by C. M√Æcu, which contained some praise of the 1918 Republic, was mistakenly published by the Union of Communist Youth, prompting the intervention of official censors.Ion Zainea, \\"Aspecte din activitatea cenzurii comuniste: controlul produc»õiei de carte social-politicƒÉ.

As he noted, the Banat and other regions needed to be devolved by a Romanian \\"perestroika\\".Ion Dezideriu S√Ærbu, \\"Exerci»õii de luciditate\\", in Adriana Babe≈£i, Cornel Ungureanu (eds), Europa CentralƒÉ. Memorie, paradis, apocalipsƒÉ, pp. 155‚Äì156. Ia»ôi: Polirom, 1998. The anti-communist Revolution of 1989, which began in Timi»ôoara, reignited controversies about autonomy and separatism. Before his toppling and execution, Ceau»ôescu accused the revolutionaries of wanting to separate Transylvania and the Banat from Romania. »òtefan Both, \\"Separatismul bƒÉnƒÉ»õean: de la teama lui Ceau»ôescu »ôi frica lui Ion Iliescu la agitatorii lui Victor Ponta\\", in AdevƒÉrul (Timi»ôoara edition), 10 November 2014 This charge was again proffered in disputes between the post-communist National Salvation Front and its opponents. Members of the former spuriously claimed that the latter's Proclamation of Timi»ôoara was about regional autonomy. Ruxandra Cesereanu, \\"Proclama»õia de la Timi»ôoara si legea lustra»õiei\\", in Revista 22, Issue 782, March 2005 During the Ceau»ôescu era, the Swabian exodus had been accelerated, as the regime had agreed to provide exit visas for tens of thousands of Romanian Germans in exchange for hard currency. »òtefan Both, \\"MƒÉrturiile »ôvabilor v√¢ndu»õi de Ceau»ôescu Germaniei.

These groups, flying a white cross on green as their flag, became interested in recovering the region's Habsburg heritage, and in some cases declared themselves ethnically distinct from other Romanians.Minahan, pp. 63‚Äì64 In 2013, activists from this movement endorsed both regional independence and European federalism.Minahan, p. 64 The green flag became popular as a sign of regional affiliation, and was prominently displayed during the anti-government rallies of 2014. This issue was highlighted by the pro-government Social Democrats, who saw it as a move toward autonomy or independence; that claim was denied by members of the Banat League.

Flying Corps is one of the few flight simulators to have dealt with the First World War - Red Baron, Knights of the Sky and the more arcade- oriented Wings have attempted to do the same, but most companies focus on modern air combat and World War II (usually the Battle of Britain). Plot The game is split in four campaigns: The Flying Circus (1917), Battle of Cambrai 1917, Spring Offensive (1918) and Hat In The Ring (1918). Several airplanes are available, including the Sopwith Camel, the Nieuport 28 and the Fokker Dr.I.

The mutated remains of the Kaled people of the planet Skaro, they travel around in tank-like mechanical casings, and are a race bent on universal conquest and destruction. They are also, collectively, the greatest alien adversaries of the Time Lord known as the Doctor, having evolved over the course of the series from a weak race to monsters capable of destroying even the Time Lords and achieving control of the universe. Main history =Origins= The First Doctor first encounters the Daleks in the second serial of the show, The Daleks (1963‚àí64). In this version of Dalek history, the Dalek homeworld of Skaro is described by the Daleks in the second episode as having once been home to two humanoid races: the Daleks and the Thals. Following a short but terrible nuclear war between the races \\"over five hundred years ago\\", the Thals were horribly mutated and the \\"Dalek forefathers\\" retired into the city. According to the Thals in the third episode, the Daleks were originally teachers and philosophers, while the Doctor states in the fourth episode that the Daleks were called Dals back then, and speculates that the Daleks had just as badly been mutated at the time. They are more or less confined to their city; their motive power being electricity conducted via metal walkways. After discovering the anti-radiation drugs of the Thals kill them, the now-xenophobic Daleks decide to release radiation from their nuclear reactors into Skaro's atmosphere, leaving only the Daleks. However, the TARDIS crew convince the Thals to fight the Daleks to stop this. At the end of this serial, the Daleks are seemingly wiped out when their power source is destroyed. However, the popularity of the Daleks ensured their return. Later stories They next appeared in The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), which shows the Daleks having conquered and occupied the Earth in the mid-22nd century after a meteorite shower and a plague. The First Doctor explains the presence of the Daleks to his companions, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, by saying that the events take place \\"a million years\\" before The Daleks, and that what they are witnessing is the \\"middle period\\" of Dalek history. However, these Daleks as an invasion force are able to move without the need for metal paths, drawing power through what appear to be radio dishes on their backs. The Daleks here plan to destroy the Earth's magnetic core and pilot the planet. However, the Doctor and his companions cause a rebellion in the mine workings, and the Dalek Saucer is destroyed by the bomb intended for Earth's core. Over the course of their next few appearances, the Daleks developed time travel in The Chase (1965), where they use a time machine to pursue the TARDIS crew, before landing on the planet Mechanus and battling the robotic Mechanoids. Here, the radio dishes have vanished, replaced with slats around the midriff functioning as solar panels. In the year 4000 (The Daleks' Master Plan, 1965‚Äì66), they have an interstellar Dalek Empire. In this story, the Daleks form an alliance with beings from the 'Outer Galaxies' in a plot to attack the Solar System with help from its treacherous Guardian Mavic Chen, who supplies them with Taranium for the Time Destructor. The First Doctor steals the Taranium during the final meeting on the planet Kembel, but the Daleks pursue him through time and space. They finally recover the Taranium and turn on the delegates, leading to Mavic Chen's death. However, the surviving delegates are released and go back to their own galaxies to warn them of the Daleks. The Doctor activates the Time Destructor and the Daleks are destroyed, though his companion Sara Kingdom is turned to dust. The Daleks develop factory ships for conquest, as seen in The Power of the Daleks (1966). Daleks are revived after their ship has been in a swamp on the planet Vulcan for over 200 years. They recognise the newly regenerated Second Doctor. The Daleks join forces with a rebel group and with the colony's power source they begin producing more Daleks to exterminate the colony. However, the Doctor turns the power source against the Daleks and apparently destroys them. A second attempt to end the Dalek saga was made in The Evil of the Daleks (1967), which also introduced a Dalek Emperor. In that story, the Daleks capture the Second Doctor and Jamie McCrimmon, planning to use them to discover the human factor. They plan to use this to find the Dalek Factor and spread it throughout human history. The conflagration caused by a Dalek civil war when Daleks are infected by the Human Factor is declared by the Doctor to be \\"the final end.\\" This was because Terry Nation was in negotiations to sell the Dalek concept to American television. Although the sale did not succeed, the Daleks did not appear again for five years. An untransmitted line of dialogue in the original script for Day of the Daleks mentions the supposed final end, when one of the Daleks says that the humanised Daleks were wiped out by the true Daleks. However, the humanised Daleks would later appear in a comic strip (Children of the Revolution) in Doctor Who Magazine, issues #312‚Äì317. The Daleks returned in the Third Doctor serial Day of the Daleks (1972), where once again they use time travel technology and rule the Earth in the 22nd century in an alternate timeline created by wars started by a Peace Conference being disrupted. The Doctor discovers the conference was disrupted by an attempt by guerillas from the future to assassinate Sir Reginald Styles, who was held responsible for disrupting the conference. The Doctor travels back to prevent this future, and, despite the Daleks travelling back to disrupt the conference, the delegates are saved, the Daleks destroyed, and the timeline negated. The Daleks were re-established as a species bent on universal conquest, as seen in Frontier in Space (1973) where the Daleks try to cause a war between Earth and Draconia with help from the Master. This leads directly into Planet of the Daleks (also 1973), where the Daleks have invaded the planet Spiridon and are attempting to find a way to become invisible. Later on, in Death to the Daleks (1974), the Daleks try to stop humans getting the cure to a plague from Exxilon. They are trapped on the planet with the Third Doctor and humans when the Exxilon City drains the power from their ships. However, the Third Doctor destroys the brain of the city while the Daleks and humans destroy the transmitter, and the Daleks are destroyed by a human sacrificing himself with a Dalek bomb. The Dalek Emperor is not in attendance; the Daleks being led by a Supreme Dalek instead, with references made to a Dalek High Council. Frontier and Planet are set in the 26th century, while Death refers to the recent \\"Dalek Wars\\". =Genesis of the Daleks= The Kaled Chief Scientist, Davros (right), and his lieutenant, Nyder (left). In 1975, Terry Nation retconned the Daleks' origins in the serial Genesis of the Daleks, where the Fourth Doctor was sent by the Time Lords to the moment of the Daleks' creation, to stop the Dalek race before it could begin or to lessen their dominance in the future. The Kaleds (an anagram of Dalek), are a race of humanoid extraterrestrials and the forebears of the Daleks. The Kaleds, with their stylised salutes and authoritarian political structure, were thinly veiled analogues of the Nazis. In this serial, it was the Kaleds who waged war on the Thals. The Daleks originate during the Kaled-Thal War, which is portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of attrition, fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, with weapons becoming progressively less sophisticated as resources became scarcer, not the short nuclear exchange previously described. The crippled Kaled chief scientist and evil genius Davros deems the mutations from the fallout irreversible, and then experiments on living cells, treating them with chemicals and accelerating the mutations to discover the eventual mutated Kaled form and ensure its survival. The serial suggests that mutations among the general Kaled populace are not as advanced as implied by the earlier account, and that the development of the mutated creatures that become the Daleks is engineered by Davros for his own purposes. Ostensibly, he is only speeding up the process, to predict the final form of the Kaled mutation; seeing its helplessness, he devises the means for his race's continued existence. Ultimately, he uses his creations to prematurely replace the non-mutated members of his race with the Daleks. These genetically conditioned forms are placed in Mark III \\"travel machines\\" whose design is based on his own life-support chair. The tank-like travel machines coupled with the mutants become the first Daleks. The Doctor leads other Kaled scientists to try to shut down the Dalek project. To prevent this, Davros arranges for the Thals to wipe out his own people. The Daleks are then sent to exterminate the Thals, but later turn on Davros and apparently kill him. While a group of surviving Thals wire the Kaled research bunker with explosives, the Doctor has the opportunity to fulfill his mission and destroy the Daleks at their genesis, but when the time comes, the Doctor could not perform what he sees as an act of genocide. He believes that despite the horror, evil and destruction that the Daleks would inflict on the universe, ultimately there must be 'some greater good'. He later returns to the incubation chamber and does destroy the Dalek embryos, but afterwards, the Doctor concludes that this action, together with the Thals' sealing them in the bunker, had only slowed their progress by a thousand years at most. The Discontinuity Guide by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping argues that the Doctor did succeed in changing Dalek history. However, other commentators argue that it is possible to reconcile the pre- and post-Genesis stories without the need to invoke two versions of Dalek history. \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012) shows that Daleks still encountered the Doctor on Spiridon, Kembel, Aridius, Vulcan, and Exxilon, implying that the pre-Genesis stories still took place. =Post- Genesis history= In Destiny of the Daleks (1979), it was revealed that Davros had survived the Daleks' attack and lived on, buried in a bunker in suspended animation. During the time Davros was sleeping, the Daleks began sending recon scouts as revealed in \\"Resolution\\" (2019) to locate planets for the Daleks to conquer. In time, the Daleks completely abandoned Skaro and established a vast interstellar empire while ultimately ending up in a stalemate with a hostile android race called the Movellans. This forces the Daleks to send an expedition to the ruins of Skaro to recover Davros to give them the advantage with a Movellan expedition sent to stop them. The Daleks succeed in reviving Davros, who theorises that the extreme intelligence and rationality of the battle computers are to blame and that the first side to take a seemingly reckless gamble would tip the balance in their favour. However, the Fourth Doctor intervenes and prevented either the Dalek or Movellan expeditions from returning with this insight. Davros falls into the hands of a human space empire and is put back in suspended animation for indefinite imprisonment. This impasse continues for nearly a century until the Movellans developed a highly virulent biological agent that targets Dalek DNA. This forces the Dalek to retrieve Davros in the events of Resurrection of the Daleks to have him develop a defense against the disease. But Davros uses this to take personal command of the Daleks in an act of betrayal, causing a schism among the Daleks between one faction following Davros' leadership and another rejecting their creator to instead follow the Supreme Dalek. By the time of Revelation of the Daleks (1985), Davros is in hiding at the Tranquil Repose funeral facility on the planet Necros, experimenting with physically transforming humans into Daleks. He is also placing those Daleks loyal to him into white and gold casings to distinguish them from the usual black and grey Daleks, but his plans are undone when a worker at the facility contacts the original Daleks. These Daleks arrive on Necros, exterminate the white and gold Daleks and capture Davros, who is returned to Skaro to face trial. The main Dalek army Davros had hidden is destroyed by a bomb the assassin Orcini set off, sacrificing himself in the process. =Civil War= Davros made his next televised appearance in the serial Remembrance of the Daleks (1988). Apparently, events had taken place off-screen, as he appears in the guise of the Dalek Emperor, leading his gold and white Imperial Daleks with control over Skaro. Davros had at this point modified the Imperial Daleks, adding cybernetic enhancements to their organic components. A new model \\"Special Weapons Dalek\\" was introduced with an enormously powerful cannon and armour capable of deflecting regular Dalek weaponry. Also, for the first time, a Dalek was clearly seen on screen to hover up a flight of stairs. Pitted against the Imperial Daleks are the Renegade Daleks, led by a black Supreme Dalek. The name \\"renegade\\" suggests that the tables had turned and Davros' side had the upper hand. Both Dalek factions become aware that the Hand of Omega, a Gallifreyan stellar engineering device, was hidden on Earth in the year 1963. Both factions send expeditions to Earth, battling each other to retrieve it, hoping to use the Hand to create a power source that would refine their crude time travel technology. Ultimately, the Imperial Daleks succeed, not knowing that the Seventh Doctor had inserted a booby trap into the Hand's programming. When Davros activates it, Skaro's sun goes supernova, and both the Dalek homeworld (in the future) and the Imperial Dalek fleet are destroyed. Davros, however, apparently escapes his flagship's destruction in an escape pod. The Renegade Supreme Dalek self-destructs when the Doctor informs it that it has failed and is the last of its kind. Remembrance of the Daleks marked the last on-screen appearance of the Daleks in the context of the programme until 2005, save for charity specials like Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death and the use of Dalek voices in the Doctor Who television movie. =The Master on Skaro= In the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, the Master is seen being put on trial on Skaro. The Daleks are heard, but not seen, exterminating the Master‚Äîor so the Doctor initially thought‚Äîafter sentence is passed for his \\"evil crimes\\". Before they do this, however, the Eighth Doctor narrates that the Master makes a \\"last, and [he] thought somewhat curious, request\\" for the Seventh Doctor, near the end of his incarnation, to take the Master's remains back to Gallifrey. =Time War and aftermath= A new Doctor Who series was announced for 2005 and the Daleks have appeared in every series since (as of series 11). In the first series of the revival, the Daleks serve as the main antagonists. In \\"Dalek\\" (2005), it was revealed that the Daleks were involved with the Time Lords in a Time War, in which both sides were believed to have been practically wiped out. The Ninth Doctor encounters a surviving Dalek who somehow fell through time to 20th century Earth. By 2012, it had passed into the hands of American billionaire Henry van Statten, who dubs it a \\"Metaltron\\" and keeps it in a secret underground museum called the Vault along with other alien artefacts. The Dalek is damaged, remaining silent and helpless until the Ninth Doctor arrives at the Vault. Absorbing DNA from the Doctor's companion Rose Tyler, it regenerates itself and goes on a killing spree. However, having absorbed Rose's DNA, it continues to mutate and finds itself beset with unfamiliar, human feelings. Realising it is now \\"contaminated\\", the mutant asks Rose to order it to destroy itself, rather than continue to live in that way. It then disintegrates itself with an energy field created by the spheres along its lower casing. The new Time War Daleks exhibit abilities not seen before, including a swivelling midsection that allows it a 360-degree field of fire and a force field that disintegrates bullets before they strike it. In addition to the ability to fly, it is also able to regenerate itself by means of absorbing electrical power and the DNA of a time traveller. The \\"plunger\\" manipulator arm is also able to crush a man's skull in addition to the technology interfacing abilities shown by earlier models. The laser is shown to be conducted like electricity, when the Dalek fires in a wet metal room. The Doctor describes the Dalek as a \\"genius\\", able to calculate a thousand billion lock combinations in a single second and to download the entire contents of the Internet. A more sophisticated model of the Dalek mutant was also shown. The two-part 2005 series finale, comprising \\"Bad Wolf\\" and \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" revealed that this Dalek was, in fact, not the sole survivor of its race. The Emperor Dalek's ship had also survived, falling through time much as the lone Dalek did. Hidden, it began to rebuild, infiltrating Earth society over the course of centuries and using human genetic material to create a new Dalek race. Having done this, the Dalek Emperor came to see itself as a god, and built its new society around the Daleks' worship of itself. The new Daleks, because of origin as being spawned from impure genetic material, became as mad as their creator and even more dangerous as a result, with the Doctor adding their silence over the centuries to be partly responsible for it. Emperor of the Daleks. Subtly manipulating the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire of the year 200,000 by means of news programmes transmitted from Satellite 5 in Earth orbit, the Daleks installed the monstrous Jagrafess as mankind's keeper. The Ninth Doctor removes the Jagrafess in \\"The Long Game\\", but was unaware that the Daleks were behind it. Over the next hundred years, the Daleks continued their scheme, recreating Satellite Five as the Game Station, acquiring more humans for mutation by subjecting them to twisted reality television games. The station's Controller transports the Ninth Doctor and his companions into the station, where the Doctor discovers the Dalek presence. The race, now numbering close to half a million, are poised to invade Earth with a fleet of 200 ships. The Daleks attack Earth, destroying entire continents. The Doctor builds a Delta Wave projector that would wipe out the Daleks, but would also eliminate all life on one side of the Earth, and finds himself unable to trigger it. However, Rose absorbs energies from the spacetime vortex by staring into the heart of the TARDIS and uses those energies to pilot the TARDIS back to the Doctor and reduce the Daleks and their fleet to atoms. =The Cult of Skaro= The Cult emerge from the void ship. In the 2006 series finale, \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\", it was revealed that members of the Cult of Skaro had also escaped during the Time War by going into the nothingness between dimensions ‚Äì the Void ‚Äì taking with them a Time Lord prison, dubbed the Genesis Ark, which contains millions of Daleks. The Daleks' Void ship finally emerges on 21st century Earth, where it is examined by the Torchwood Institute. The path of the void ship also leaves a breach in spacetime that allows the parallel Earth Cybermen to cross over into the Doctor's universe. The Daleks reject the Cybermen's proposal for an alliance to conquer the universe and the Ark is opened, releasing millions of Daleks to wage all-out war against the Cybermen across the planet. Ultimately, both armies are sucked back into the Void due to the actions of the Tenth Doctor. However, Sec is seen activating an \\"emergency temporal shift\\" before being sucked in. The following series reveals that Caan, Thay and Jast were also able to escape in the same fashion. The Dalek Sec Hybrid, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. Ending up in New York in 1930 during the episode \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\" (2007), after a failed attempt to restart their species via cloning, Sec hatches a plan of evolving the species into a new race that would adapt to the changing times, noting that despite their quest for perfection, their race is close to extinction. To that end, he telepathically contacts a human, Mr Diagoras, to serve as their servant in finishing the Empire State Building and reinforcing it with Dalekanium metal. The other Cult members (Dalek Thay, Dalek Caan, and Dalek Jast) are assigned to capture humans, which would be split into two groups. Through a quick brain scan, the Daleks determine the intelligence of each captured human. The more intelligent humans become part of the Final Experiment, while the less intelligent are transformed into pig slaves, humanoid creatures with pig-like faces, to capture more humans. The Final Experiment involves Dalek Sec making the ultimate sacrifice, and despite objections from his comrades, Dalek Sec envelops Diagoras in his tentacles and encases him in a stomach-like pouch in the process absorbing Diagoras which later transforms Sec into a new species of Hybrid Dalek, a Human Dalek. In the second part of the story, \\"Evolution of the Daleks\\" (2007), while having the Tenth Doctor as his captive, Sec reveals that his transformation is the first part of the Final Experiment. The next stage involves the introduction of his hybrid DNA into thousands of captured and mind-wiped humans, whose DNA would be spliced through gamma radiation from the Sun, channelled into the Empire State Building and into the transgenic laboratory where the bodies are held. Notable changes come to this plan upon the transformation of Dalek Sec who is filled with new emotions. He believes that a return to their biological roots is necessary and even makes peace with the Daleks' nemesis the Doctor, and asks for his help in relocating the new Dalek species. However, Sec fails to realise the Dalek imperative for racial purity among his comrades, who turn on him and replace his genetic sample with their own so the Dalekised humans would wipe out humanity and transform Earth into New Skaro. Sec is killed and the Daleks' plans fall into ruin when their Dalek army is corrupted with Time Lord DNA. Daleks Thay and Jast are killed, leaving the new commander, Dalek Caan, the only survivor as he terminates the Dalek-Human army by remote, killing the newly born species. The Doctor attempts to show mercy to Caan despite everything, but the Dalek initiates an emergency temporal shift to escape. =New Dalek Empire= In \\"The Stolen Earth\\" (2008), both Davros and a red Supreme Dalek are seen as rulers of the New Dalek Empire. It is revealed that Caan forced himself into the Time War to save Davros from destruction at the Gates of Elysium. He took his creator to safety, but the ordeal from forcing himself into the time-locked moment allowed him to \\"see all of time\\", although it left him insane but able to predict about a forthcoming showdown with the Tenth Doctor. While Davros provides scientific and strategic guidance, he is still essentially subservient to the Supreme Dalek. Davros used cells from his own body to create a new race of Daleks which begin stealing planets from across time and space, creating an artificial solar system. They are arranged in such a way that they uniquely channel energy that can be harnessed. These planets are placed in the rift in the Medusa Cascade, which is set a second out of sync from time, making it the perfect hiding place. Follow-up episode \\"Journey's End\\" (2008) shows Davros gloating that his plan is to destroy reality itself. \\"The Crucible\\" is revealed to be a gigantic space station that houses the entire empire and is used for experimentations with Davros' invention, the reality bomb. The bomb is a device that uses the energy of the 27 planets, and is powerful enough to cancel out even the slightest atoms outside of the Medusa Cascade. The Supreme Dalek plans to use this device to destroy reality itself, using Davros' genius and Caan's prophetical powers for guidance. Ultimately, the Daleks hope to make themselves the sole living race in the universe. The interference of the Doctor and his companions stops Davros' plans, who learns that Caan engineered it so the Daleks would be destroyed forever. With the Crucible exploding from all the Daleks self-destructing and the Supreme Dalek destroyed, the fates of both Davros and Caan are left ambiguous. In \\"The Waters of Mars\\" (2009), Adelaide Brooke recalls how a Dalek spared her life during the 2009 invasion. The Tenth Doctor concludes that the Dalek knew she was a fixed point in time, and thus could not kill her without threatening the laws of time. Subsequently, in 2009‚Äì2010 two-part special \\"The End of Time\\", the Time Lords nearly escape the Time Lock, which would also release the horrors of the Time War upon the universe once again, including the full Dalek Empire, but this eventuality is averted by the Tenth Doctor. =New Dalek Paradigm= In \\"The Beast Below\\" (2010), a Dalek shadow can be seen during Prime Minister Winston Churchill's telephone conversation with the Eleventh Doctor. In \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" (2010), it is revealed that a Dalek ship survived its previous encounter with the Doctor, and fell back through time to 1941. The ship appears to be badly damaged, with only three surviving Daleks on board, \\"at the end of [their] rope\\". The surviving Daleks discovered that a Progenitor, a small capsule containing pure Dalek DNA, had also fallen back through time. The Daleks retrieved it, planning to create a new race of Daleks, but were unable to activate the capsule, as it couldn't recognise these Daleks and, according to the Eleventh Doctor, saw them as \\"impure\\". To solve this problem, they set a trap for the Doctor. This trap consists of building an android who believes himself to be human working undercover for the war cause. He claims to have invented the Daleks, calling them \\"Ironsides\\". With Dalek blueprints and multiple Daleks painted in British Army Khaki, Winston Churchill uses them as war weapons, although they are mostly seen to be carrying around files and asking staff, \\"Would you care for some tea?\\" The Eleventh Doctor is surprised as these khaki Daleks appear to have forgotten their own purpose. This is all part of their plan, however: he proclaims, \\"I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!\\" which the Daleks back on the ship use as a testimony to activate the progenitor. The five New Paradigm Daleks that appear then exterminate their predecessors with no resistance, as they were deemed inferior. Each Dalek is a different colour and each represents a specific place in Dalek Hierarchy ‚Äî Drone, Scientist, Strategist, Eternal and Supreme. The Daleks activate a time corridor, and escape into the future, delaying the Doctor by threatening to destroy Earth. Amy Pond doesn't recognise the Daleks when she first meets them, despite the Daleks' invasion of Earth and the planets appearing in Earth's sky, which the Doctor says is not possible. In \\"Flesh and Stone\\" (2010), the Eleventh Doctor theorises that the cracks in the universe caused the events to be unwritten. The White Supreme Dalek, Yellow Eternal Dalek and Red Drone Dalek reappear in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" (2010) as part of the Alliance. They are present at the opening of the Pandorica and the Supreme Dalek reveals the origin behind the Pandorica, the Alliance and Stonehenge before the Eleventh Doctor is imprisoned in the Pandorica prison. In follow-up episode \\"The Big Bang\\" (2010), after all of reality becomes cracked, the Daleks turn to stone due to their history being erased. A Stone Dalek is later seen at a museum with the Pandorica, and is awoken when it gets hit by the regenerative field of the Pandorica. It pursues and shoots the Doctor, but due to its power being weak, it was not a fatal shot. However, River Song, enraged and believing the Doctor to be dead, aims her gun at the Stone Dalek, knowing that its defences were weak. She later claims that the Dalek died, but it is not shown onscreen whether it did. By the end of the episode, the Doctor reverses the explosion of the TARDIS and the collapse of reality. A Dalek briefly appears in \\"The Wedding of River Song\\" (2010), having been heavily damaged by the Eleventh Doctor, who then rips its dome off and scans its data core for information about the Silence. This Dalek is the same design as the New Paradigm Daleks. In \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012), the Eleventh Doctor, Amy Pond and Rory Williams are captured and taken to the Dalek Parliament, where they are ordered to 'save the Daleks' by the Dalek Prime Minister and enter the Asylum of the Daleks, which is a planetary prison surrounded by an impenetrable force-field containing battle-scarred and insane Daleks. They are tasked with an impossible and suicidal mission: to infiltrate the planet and disable the force-field so that the Daleks can destroy the Asylum, stopping the prisoners from escaping. Whilst seeking a way to disable the force-field, the trio meet Oswin Oswald, who has a suspiciously vast amount of access to the Asylum and is able to 'hack' Dalek technology to help guide the trio's way through the Asylum. When the Doctor enters a room called 'Intensive Care', he is faced with all of the battle-scarred Daleks who had survived the Doctor's interference throughout many battles. The Doctor's presence wakes them up with the intention of exterminating him, but Oswin hacks into the path-web (a psychic layer which all Daleks use to communicate with each other) and performs a 'master delete' on all information connected to the Doctor. This causes all Daleks to forget the Doctor, not recognising him while he returns to the Dalek ship to boast about his escape from the Asylum. \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013), set during the final day of the Time War, revealed that instead of Gallifrey and the Time Lords burning when the Dalek fleet was wiped out, 13 incarnations of the Doctor actually froze Gallifrey in a \\"parallel pocket universe\\"; its sudden disappearance causing the Daleks to destroy themselves in the crossfire as they concentrated fire on the planet, though the time streams being out of sync meant the Doctor did not retain his memory until his eleventh incarnation; earlier on in the episode, both the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctors mistakenly believe that the War Doctor killed all of the Time Lords on the last day of the Time War. During the centuries-long siege of Trenzalore during \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013), upon learning of the Time Lords' survival with the intent to resume the Time War, the Daleks regain their memories of the Doctor after probing the mind of Mother Superior Tasha Lem of the Church of the Papal Mainframe. The Daleks end up being the last of the Doctor's enemies to besiege Trenzalore as everyone else had either retreated or been destroyed. The Daleks nearly finish the Eleventh Doctor, now a frail old man with no regenerations left, once and for all on Trenzalore as history dictated. However, due to the pleas of Clara Oswald, the Time Lords intervene, granting the Doctor a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor promptly starts regenerating and uses his excess regeneration energy to obliterate the Dalek forces on Trenzalore. In \\"Into the Dalek\\" (2014), the Doctor, regenerated into his twelfth incarnation, encounters a rebel group engaging the Dalek force with a damaged one in their custody. Hearing the Dalek spout a desire to destroy its kind, the Doctor minimises himself to enter the Dalek the Doctor refers to as \\"Rusty\\" with Clara and a team of soldiers. After it is revealed the malfunction was due to an internal radiation leak, Rusty relapses once repaired and summons a Dalek platoon to destroy the rebel station. Still inside Rusty, convinced by Clara there is still a chance while having her restore memory of the Dalek's newfound morality, the Doctor manages to connect with Rusty's consciousness to cement its ideals. However, Rusty's change of heart is instead fuelled by seeing the Doctor's anger and complete hatred towards the Dalek race, destroying the platoon before returning to the Dalek ship to act on its new mission incognito. The Daleks return on a rebuilt Skaro in \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\" (2015), where the Twelfth Doctor, the Master, who now goes by \\"Missy\\", and Clara have been taken. The Daleks take Missy and Clara prisoner in the city, and appear to exterminate Missy and Clara after toying with them. In the following episode, \\"The Witch's Familiar\\" (2015), it is revealed that Missy and Clara survived the Daleks' blasts through the modified vortex manipulators they were wearing using energy from the gunstick blasts at the last moment before impact. In the episode, Davros tricks the Doctor into using up his regeneration energy to heal Davros and the Dalek race as part of a plan to fulfil a prophecy about the creation of a Dalek-Time Lord hybrid. However, Missy releases the Doctor from capture, and the Doctor reveals that he willingly bluffed Davros into letting the Doctor heal the Daleks, as the regeneration energy also awakens the liquefied and rotting Dalek mutants from the city sewers. The sewer Daleks revolt against the Daleks in the city above by entering the city through the city pipes and bury the city. Surrounded by Daleks in the collapsing city, Missy tells the Daleks that she has a \\"very clever idea\\". After a brief cameo in \\"The Pilot\\" (2017), a special type of Dalek known as a Recon Scout Dalek appears in 2019's \\"Resolution\\", to face off against the Thirteenth Doctor and companions Graham, Yaz and Ryan; the latter accompanied by his estranged dad. When its casing was destroyed in an ancient battle and the mutant is unearthed in an archaeological dig centuries later, the Doctor arrives to investigate, but not before the mutant attaches itself to one of the archaeologists. Using said archaeologist as a puppet, the Dalek mutant gathers together enough scrap materials to construct a temporary casing, which it uses to flee to HCHQ in a plan to summon the Dalek fleet and conquer Earth. The Doctor stops this plan and destroys the Dalek's temporary casing, but the mutant attaches itself to Ryan's dad and blackmails the Doctor to take it to Skaro. The Doctor complies, but actually takes the mutant to a supernova and sucks it out into space, detaching it from Ryan's dad in the process and destroying it. Spin-off media The Daleks have appeared in many Doctor Who spin-offs, sometimes opposing the Doctor and sometimes on their own. All these spin-offs are of uncertain canonicity, and not all of them can be easily reconciled with the television series or with each other. Where they fit in the Dalek timeline is also uncertain. =Comic strips= The first appearance of the Daleks beyond the television series was in The Dalek Book (1964), an illustrated volume written by Terry Nation and David Whitaker. It tells the story of a Dalek invasion of Earth's solar system. Here it is claimed Skaro has moved into Earth's Solar System. Later stories showed Sara Kingdom, presumably meaning they take place in the latter 40th Century. Here the Daleks make attempts to invade the Solar System and the Space Security Service is founded to defeat them. In 1965, the comic book TV Century 21 began publishing The Daleks, which was written by Whitaker and included an account of the Daleks' origins. (The comic strip was, years later, collected together in an edition titled The Dalek Chronicles). The TV 21 strips portray the opposing sides in Skaro's war as the Thals and the Daleks, shown as diminutive blue men with large heads somewhat similar in appearance to Dan Dare's Mekon. The Thals are a peaceful race who live on the continent of Davius. Across the Ocean of Ooze, the Daleks inhabit Dalazar. According to the comic, these humanoid Daleks build neutron bombs which are accidentally detonated by a meteorite storm. (The idea of the war having an accidental, rather than deliberate origin, goes back to an earlier draft of the first Dalek television story.) The Daleks' chief scientist, Yarvelling, had built Dalek casings as war machines prior to the nuclear holocaust. After the neutron bombs explode, Yarvelling and Zolfian, the warlord of the humanoid Daleks, explore their continent and contract radiation sickness. They discover that a mutated Dalek had survived in the war machine casing. This Dalek persuades Yarvelling and Zolfian to build more Dalek casings for their mutated descendants. Before the last two humanoid Daleks die, it declares itself the Dalek Emperor, and has a new casing built to reflect its new rank, slightly shorter than the other Daleks, with a disproportionately large spheroid head section and in gold rather than grey. Later stories in the Dalek comic tell of the expansion of the Daleks' empire, including a lengthy war against the Mechanoids which is averted by a robot sent from another planet. In the last published comic in this series, the Daleks learn the location of Earth, which they propose to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television later, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the Dalek Emperor did show up later on in the programme. The Doctor Who Magazine comic strips such as Nemesis of the Daleks (DWM #152-#155) pit the 26th century Daleks against the formidable Dalek Killer Abslom Daak and several more times against the Doctor. Emperor of the Daleks! (DWM #197-#202) reveals the Sixth Doctor deliberately rescues Davros from his trial (at the end of Revelation of the Daleks) and that the Seventh Doctor (with help from Bernice Summerfield and Daak) helps ensure Davros obtains control of the thousands-strong Dalek army frozen on Spiridon and began the Dalek civil war that would lead to the events of Remembrance of the Daleks. The Eighth Doctor faces the Daleks twice in the pages of Doctor Who Magazine: once in Fire and Brimstone (DWM #251‚Äì255) to stop them from taking control of all realities and a second time in Children of the Revolution (DWM #312‚Äì317) when he encounters the humanised Daleks created in The Evil of the Daleks, who were in hiding on the planet Kryol. =Novels= The Virgin New Adventures add background detail to both the Dalek Wars of the 26th century and the Daleks' 22nd-century invasion of Earth, including detailing the events of the Dalek conquest of Mars (and a battle against the Ice Warriors) at that time in GodEngine (1996) by Craig Hinton. The 1997 Eighth Doctor Adventures novel War of the Daleks by John Peel is set after the apparent destruction of Skaro in Remembrance of the Daleks, and reveals that the planet had not, in fact, been destroyed. A convoluted explanation includes the revelation that the planet Antalin had been terraformed to resemble Skaro and destroyed in its place. It is also revealed that the Dalek-Movellan war (and indeed most of Dalek history before the destruction of \\"Skaro\\") was actually faked for Davros' benefit. Having discovered records of Skaro's destruction during their invasion of Earth, and after their attempts to change history failed, the Daleks created an elaborate deception to save Skaro by moving Davros to Antalin and faking the situation to maintain history. Davros is put on trial by the Daleks under the Dalek Prime and disintegrated at story's end, and the Eighth Doctor sends their factory ship back in time to be discovered by the Second Doctor in The Power of the Daleks. The Eighth Doctor faces the Daleks again in Legacy of the Daleks (1998), when he returns to Earth in the aftermath of the Dalek Invasion, although in this case the Daleks are basic versions who have been reactivated by the Master (whom the Doctor unintentionally confronts out of sequence), the novel concluding with the Daleks being destroyed and the Master being left in the condition that he was seen in during The Deadly Assassin. The 2004 Telos novella The Dalek Factor by Simon Clark features a Dalek task- force using an amnesiac Doctor to trap and genetically re-engineer Thals with the \\"Dalek Factor\\" (the thoughts and instincts of a Dalek) so they can spread it throughout the Thal gene pool. Once this is accomplished, the Daleks plan to trigger the factor, wiping out the Thals by turning them into Daleks. The 2006 New Series Adventures novella I am a Dalek by Gareth Roberts has the Daleks attempting the same stratagem on humans during the Time War, but on a smaller scale that infects only one 20th century human. In the 2009 novel Prisoner of the Daleks, the Tenth Doctor crosses into the pre-Time War Dalek timeline by accident, and lands in the 26th century; references are made to a recent conflict with the Draconians from Frontier in Space and the Osterhagen Principle, named after a UNIT weapon from Journey's End, is said to have been invented 500 years before. In this period of history, the pre-Time War Dalek Empire is fighting a huge galactic war against Earth, with Earth Command forced to hire bounty hunters to help them. However, despite the Daleks having superior technology, the war has reached a stalemate. To win the war, the Daleks plan to open the Arkheon Threshold, a schism in time and space, and launch a huge Dalek force into the time vortex to conquer the whole of time and space. They capture a fleet of ships escaping from a colony planet and force them to work on breaking through to the Threshold with manual labour. Their plan is however defeated when the Doctor lures them to an abandoned refuelling planet where the TARDIS is located‚Äîthe Daleks needing the TARDIS to make the experiment work‚Äîand then detonates the remaining fuel stores, destroying a Dalek science squad and a small Dalek fleet. The novel ends with the Earth forces overwhelming the Dalek forces at the Arkheon Threshold, and Earth going on the offensive. In 2013, another novel, The Dalek Generation, was released. It shows that in the future, the Daleks, after a galactic recession, have helped develop planets for humanity which are called the Sunlight Worlds. These Daleks work with the Dalek Time Controller, a character from the Big Finish audios, to manipulate the Eleventh Doctor into helping them activate the Cradle of the Gods, a device with which they hope to turn the Sunlight Planets into copies of Skaro. However, the Doctor is able to foil their plan with the help of the Dalek Human Jenibeth, although the Dalek Time Controller escapes. Engines of War (2014) features the War Doctor crash landing on a Dalek-occupied planet, Moldox, where he meets a Dalek hunter called Cinder. This story introduces a group of five Daleks called the Eternity Circle created by the Dalek Emperor. The Daleks plan to create a Temporal Cannon powered by the energy harnessed from the Tantalus Eye to wipe Gallifrey from history. They are defeated when the Doctor tells Borusa to destroy all Dalek traces around the Eye. =Audio plays= The Daleks also appear without Davros in many of the Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish Productions. The first four Doctor Who audio plays starring the Daleks were released under the \\"Dalek Empire\\" banner, and portrays a territorially expansive Dalek army under the command of the Emperor (who does not appear to be Davros). In The Genocide Machine (2000), the Daleks invade the Kar-Charrat Library to learn information they eventually use in The Apocalypse Element. In that play, the Daleks invade the Time Lords' home planet, Gallifrey, but are eventually defeated. They also use the eponymous \\"apocalypse element\\" to burn an entire galaxy, Seriphia, and plan to conquer the now-empty galaxy and use it as a new base for their empire. The third play, The Mutant Phase (2000), has few links with the others in the series and occurs around the time of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, where the Fifth Doctor becomes caught up in the Daleks' attempts to investigate a strange 'virus' that is mutating the Daleks into indestructible giant insects; after a confrontation with the Dalek Emperor of the far future, the events of this story are erased at its conclusion when the Emperor accepts the Doctor's warnings. The final story, The Time of the Daleks (2002), shows that the Daleks have gained much greater knowledge of time travel from their invasion of Gallifrey, attempting a complex plan to subvert human history by manipulating the timeline of William Shakespeare until the Eighth Doctor traps their fleet in a time loop of its own destruction. A spin-off series of audios, titled Dalek Empire (2001‚Äì08), is set after The Time of the Daleks and features a successful Dalek invasion of the Milky Way during an Earth Empire. The Daleks make great headway and manage to conquer their way up to Earth's solar system in a prolonged war against both humans and the Daleks of an alternate reality. They are finally defeated by a psychic attack that causes every piece of Dalek machinery to self-destruct in an ever-expanding wave that obliterates their forces and kills the Emperor. However, this also cripples civilisation of the Milky Way and sets galactic development back by a substantial amount. Centuries later, when only a handful remember the Daleks, the Dalek Empire attacks again under the command of a Dalek Supreme, which infects the borders of the galaxy with a virus that genetically re-engineers humans into Daleks. By the end of the third Dalek Empire series, the Daleks have a new giant army and are poised to go to war with the Galactic Federation, with the outcome uncertain. The 2003 Big Finish audio Jubilee depicts an alternate Earth in which the Sixth Doctor had helped defeat a Dalek invasion in 1903. Most of the story is set a hundred years later, in a world in which Dalek technology and ideals have been used to create a fascist and sexist \\"English Empire\\". This timeline is largely erased at the story's end, but the Sixth Doctor warns that this nightmarish history will \\"live on, in the shadows\\". Jubilee was written by Robert Shearman, who used elements of it‚Äîsuch as the Doctor's companion bonding with a lone Dalek‚Äîfor his 2005 television episode, \\"Dalek\\". The 2004 Bernice Summerfield audio Death and the Daleks features the Daleks of the 26th century secretly controlling the Fifth Axis, a military force based on ideals of human superiority and the extermination of aliens, using them as proxies to conquer various worlds the Daleks did not wish to be seen conquering, including the Braxiatel Collection. Through the efforts of Benny Summerfield and her allies, the Axis is defeated and the Dalek control exposed. In The Juggernauts (2005), set between Revelation of the Daleks and Remembrance of the Daleks, the Daleks manipulate the Sixth Doctor for the purpose of recapturing Davros (who had escaped his Dalek captors after the end of Revelation). Davros adds human nervous tissue to robotic Mechonoids to create the Juggernauts of the play's title; he hopes to use these as an army to destroy the Daleks. At the end of the story, the self-destruct mechanism of Davros' life-support chair explodes after it is damaged by a conflict between the Daleks and the Juggernauts, destroying an entire human colony. It is not clear how Davros survives to become the Dalek Emperor, as seen in Remembrance. By the time of the 2005 Eighth Doctor audio play Terror Firma (set after Remembrance), Davros is commanding a Dalek army which has successfully conquered the Earth. His mental instability has grown to the point where \\"Davros\\" and \\"the Emperor\\" exist within him as different personalities. His Daleks recognise this instability and rebel against Davros. By the story's end, the Emperor personality is dominant, and the Daleks agree to follow him and leave Earth. The 2006 Seventh Doctor audio Return of the Daleks, set during the first Dalek Empire spin-off series, features the Daleks and Kalendorf trying to awaken their army buried on Spiridon, only for the Doctor to thwart their plans by infecting them with light-wave sickness when they attempt to recreate their old experiments to master the secret of invisibility. In Blood of the Daleks, the Eighth Doctor and new companion Lucie Miller arrive on the colony world of Red Rocket Rising, recently decimated in a meteor strike, just as a Dalek fleet arrives offering to 'help' the survivors. The Doctor soon realizes that the Daleks were actually drawn to Red Rocket Rising to destroy the experiments of Professor Martez, who created his own race of Daleks by mutating human subjects. The two factions of Daleks soon turn on each other out of their own belief in their superiority, the Doctor convincing Martez to destroy the production line for Martez's Daleks while the original Daleks are too damaged by recent battles to prevent their ship being destroyed by a bomb. Enemy of the Daleks sees the Seventh Doctor facing an experiment on the planet Bliss that attempted to create a race able to oppose the Daleks, known as the Kisaabya. Genetically engineered to eat metal as adults and flesh as larvae, their creator intended for the Kisaabya to eat the casings of the Daleks, lay their eggs in the Dalek mutants, and then have their larvae eat the mutant creatures. Feeling that the Kisaabya are too dangerous and uncontrollable, the Doctor works with the damaged Black Dalek to position itself beside the reactors of the base where the experiments took place so that the Black Dalek's self-destruct will destroy the base and the entire Kisaabya species. The 2012 audio Energy of the Daleks sees the Fourth Doctor and Leela deal with a Dalek attack on Earth in the mid-twenty-first century, where the Daleks‚Äîoriginating from the future‚Äîintend to exploit a device intended to provide Earth with free energy to disrupt Earth's gravity field and seriously damage the planet. The Doctor is able to sabotage their equipment and destroy the Dalek ship. The Fourth Doctor faces the Daleks again in the two-part audio The Dalek Contract / The Final Phase, when they trick ruthless CEO Cuthbert into hiring them as a security force while he attempts to complete his mysterious experiment, which will turn a rift in the universe into a time portal. The Daleks intend to use this rift for their own benefit, but the Doctor is able to configure the rift to generate a massive pulse of temporal energy that destroys all Dalek DNA in its vicinity. The Eighth Doctor and Lucie face the Daleks again when the Daleks attempt a second invasion of Earth (Lucie Miller/To the Death) aided by the Doctor's old friend-turned-foe the Monk, seeking revenge for the Doctor's past defeats of him. The Monk eventually realizes his mistake when the Daleks destroy the collection of human cultural artefacts he had been assembling and kill his companion Tamsin Drew (who had initially travelled with the Doctor before the Monk manipulated her into 'defecting' to his side), but the Daleks are still responsible for the deaths of Lucie and the Doctor's great-grandson, Alex Campbell, when they give their lives to destroy the Dalek mothership, the Monk only just saving the Doctor and Susan from the same fate. The Lost Stories audio The Elite features a single damaged Dalek that has manipulated a civilization into a state of civil war after it became trapped on a primitive planet, the Dalek posing as an emissary of the gods. The Fifth Doctor prepares to take the Dalek back to the fleet to give the civilization a chance to rebuild, but the Dalek is killed by one of its followers as the priest cannot accept the truth. The audio series Dark Eyes and its sequels are essentially the first stages of the Time War in the modern series, depicting the Daleks' early attempts to destroy the Time Lords through various complex schemes involving alliances with factions such as the renegade Time Lord Kotris and the powerful Eminence, opposed by the Eighth Doctor and his new companions Molly O'Sullivan and Liv Chenka. In The Curse of Davros, the Daleks, collaborating with Davros, attempt to alter the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, using a device that allows Davros to transfer Dalek minds into human bodies. The Sixth Doctor uses this to swap bodies with Davros to try and sabotage the Dalek plan from within, but is only jus able to regain his body with the aid of his new companion Flip Jackson. In Masters of Earth, the Sixth Doctor arrives on Earth during the Dalek invasion, and is forced to help a woman who will become a famous figure in the anti-Dalek resistance in the future escape to the Orkney islands while keeping his true identity secret. In the end, the Doctor is forced to end a plan to augment humanity with elite Roboman technology as he fears that the transformation would make mankind the new Daleks. In Daleks Among Us, a faction of Daleks attempt to acquire the Persuasion Machine, a machine that allows the user to control others, with this faction being led by Falkus, a clone of Davros's original human body that has gained sentience. The Daleks and Falkus are destroyed when the Doctor's companion Elizabeth Klein is able to take control of the machine. In We Are the Daleks, the Seventh Doctor discovers that the Daleks are attempting to infiltrate human society in 1987 by presenting themselves as being interested in a partnership with Earth for economic purposes. They are able to brainwash all of London into adhering to a Dalek philosophy, but the Doctor turns the tables on them when he sends the transmitter of the brainwashing signal back to Skaro, causing the Daleks to turn of themselves as their existing Dalek feelings are amplified. The audio series The War Doctor and Eighth Doctor- Time War depict the events of the Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks, with the Eighth Doctor acting as a conscientious objector focused on helping those caught in the crossfire of the war, while the War Doctor takes the battle to his enemies using increasingly questionable and dangerous methods as he rejects his usual name and methods. In the audio series Doctor Who: The Third Doctor Adventures- The Conquest of Far (set just after \\"Planet of the Daleks\\"), the Third Doctor (voiced by Tim Treloar) and Jo arrive on the distant Earth colony of Far, where the Doctor once aided in the construction of a hypergate providing rapid access to distant systems, only to discover that the Daleks have conquered the planet and intend to use the gate for themselves. With the aid of local resistance and a nearby space fleet, the Doctor is able to avert the Daleks' plan to use an augmented Robomen program to take control of humanity, modifying the equipment to shut down the Daleks' minds rather than control the humans'. =Video games= The Progenitor Daleks who first appeared in \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" return as the main antagonists of the first game of Doctor Who: The Adventure Games, City of the Daleks (2010). Following their escape, the Daleks discover the lost Time Lord artefact, the Eye of Time, allowing them to alter time as they saw fit with few consequences. The Daleks return to Skaro, rebuild their capital city of Kaalann, appoint a new blue Dalek Emperor and begin rebuilding their Empire. One of the Daleks' first acts with their newfound power over time is to invade London in 1963. In this new timeline, they succeed in killing every member of the human race. However, the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond successfully undo these events, leaving Earth unconquered and Kaalann still abandoned. A Scientist Dalek is the main antagonist of the game Mazes of Time. It kidnaps an alien family to collect Time Orbs. It recruits Drones and Strategist Daleks. It also recruits big armies of Cybermen and Silurians as a distraction for the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond. The Paradigm Daleks return as one of the antagonists of the Eternity Clock game (2012). A new Dalek Emperor is leading the invasion of Earth in 2106 using the piece of the Eternity Clock. The Emperor is purple and able to form itself as a sphere. The Daleks are using the piece of the Eternity Clock to put a Time-Lock around a large part of London in 2106. Once they perfected their Time-Lock technology, they planned to use it to put temporal bubbles around other planets, making them unstoppable. The Doctor and River Song infiltrate the Dalek Flagship and managed to take back the piece, undoing the Dalek invasion.

The meeting of experimental jazz groups with Helge Sten's rumbling drones and noise was so successful that the quartet Supersilent appeared. That same year, their triple debut album 1-3 was released as the first release on the record label Rune Grammofon. The band attracted attention with their aggressive combination of improvised jazz, frirock and noise blowouts. They are known for making only improvised music and for the distinctive uniformity of their album covers.(in Norwegian) Status Many details regarding the band suggests jazz as a classification: three of the four members of the band were formally educated as jazz musicians, the group regularly participate in jazz festivals, and their approach is to a certain extent informed by more amorphous, freer forms of jazz. However, their prominent use of electronic instrumentation such as synthesizers, theremin, loop pedals, and tape loops, as well as the rejection of traditional jazz structures, leads some to place the group's music outside their personal conception of the jazz genre. History Supersilent was formed in 1997, when the free jazz trio Veslefrekk (Arve Henriksen on trumpet, keyboardist St√•le Storl√∏kken, and Jarle Vespestad on drums) played a concert with producer and live electronics artist Helge Sten (also known as Deathprod). The concert encouraged them to record a three- disc, three-hour compilation of abrasive improvised material, simply titled 1-3, which was the label Rune Grammofon's first release in 1997. The name Supersilent derives from a logo on a truck seen in Oslo by the group around the time of these sessions. They refined their sound slightly on the follow- up, 4, which was released a year after, and in 2001, they released 5, culled from live recordings between 1999 and 2000 that changed the focus to slowly shifting textures and an almost ambient pace. 6, Supersilent's fourth release Their 2003 release 6 is their most critically acclaimed album yet, with a focus on gentler and more melodic material. 7, released in 2005, is a DVD concert film showcasing a 2004 performance in its entirety, and is another of the group's most acclaimed works.The nature of Supersilent as a free improvising band results in all of their performances consisting of entirely new material. For this reason, despite taking the format of a concert film, 7 is commonly treated as an album. Supersilent played at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival 2005. (in Norwegian) Storl√∏kken is known from nearly a decade's cooperation with Terje Rypdal's Skywards, and in 2007 Supersilent joined with Rypdal at Moldejazz for a concert. 8 was a studio album released in 2007 to mostly positive reviews. The material recorded in the 8 sessions was initially publicly announced for release as a double album entitled 8-9, but only a single album was released. Further material from these sessions was released in 2010 as the vinyl-only album 11. Early in 2009, the group announced that their drummer Jarle Vespestad had departed to pursue other musical interests. The remaining three members continued recording material and appearing live. Their seventh release, 9, was released in late 2009, and is a documentation of a single concert the trio performed earlier that year, featuring non-standard instrumentation (three Hammond organs). The group's next release has been revealed to be made up of \\"more acoustic\\" material, featuring the use of piano, recorded in the studio by the trio prior to the recording of 9. Entitled 10, this album was released on August 23, 2010. Supersilent has over the last 14 years become one of the most acclaimed improvisational bands. John Paul Jones used the opportunity to join them at the Punkt festival 2010, in Kristiansand, Norway. The bassist and multi- instrumentalist Jones has a long and eventful career as a rock musician, best known from Led Zeppelin and Them Crooked Vultures. The spontaneous and improvised collaboration with Supersilent was interesting, and they met again for new performance at Moldejazz 2012. Moldejazz.no (in Norwegian) Approach to packaging and formatting The packaging of the group's albums, designed by Kim Hiorth√∏y, is of a minimalist aesthetic: entirely white, with the exception of the cover and CD or LP label, which are printed a different colour on each release. Each label displays information about the tracks contained on the disc, and each cover displays the name and album number of the release, along with a barcode and recording and catalog details.Note that original copies of 1-3 and 4 do not share the later style of packaging, but the 2002 reissues of both albums had the format retroactively applied. The reissue cover is preferred for illustrating both albums. In keeping with the format of numbering each album, each track is numbered, reflecting the designation of the album it appears on and its position within the album. For example, the fourth track on the album 5 is entitled \\"5.4\\". Tracks unreleased on any album but contributed to promotional compilations are prefixed with the letter C and are numbered after the compilation they appear on. For example, the track contributed to the third compilation the group were involved with was named \\"C - 3.1\\". Thus far, seven such tracks have been released between 1999 and 2010, each on a different compilation.

In 1927, he received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from the College of Liberal Arts at the University of North Dakota at Grand Forks, North Dakota. In 1930, he received a Bachelor of Laws from Georgetown Law in Washington, D.C. He practiced law in Grand Forks from 1930 to 1932, before becoming a Judge of the Grand Forks Municipal Court from 1932 to 1940. In 1940, Davies and a fellow Grand Forks attorney, Charles F. Peterson, formed a private law practice. During World War II, Davies served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946. After the war, Davies went back to his private practice from 1946 to 1955. Federal judicial service On June 21, 1955, Davies was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, based in Fargo, vacated by Judge Charles Joseph Vogel. Davies was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 22, 1955, and received his commission on July 27, 1955. He assumed senior status on August 27, 1971. His service terminated on April 18, 1996, due to his death in Fargo. =Little Rock= Davies is perhaps best known for challenging Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas, during the 1957 Little Rock Integration Crisis. On August 22, 1957, Judge Archibald K. Gardner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit temporarily assigned Judge Davies to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas in Little Rock, the state capital of Arkansas, where no judge had been sitting for several months.Craig Rains.Little Rock Central High 40th Anniversary. Osro Cobb, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, describes Davies, accordingly: > He was a comparatively new jurist and was full of energy, ready to tackle > the large docket of cases that had accumulated during the many months when > no judge was sitting at Little Rock. The condition of the docket was the > reason for his assignment. I spent long hours briefing Judge Davies about > the crowded docket because the government was a party to about 30 percent of > the cases on it.

Topeka Board of Education decision (347 U.S. 483) on May 17, 1954. The decision called for the desegregation of all public schools. In 1955, the court declared that the desegregation process must continue with \\"all deliberate speed\\". The Little Rock School Board unanimously decided to comply with the high court's ruling and agreed to a gradual desegregation plan, which would be implemented in the 1958 school year.Warren, Earl. Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Cornell Law School. Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. By 1957, the NAACP had registered nine black students to attend the all-white Little Rock Central High School. Meanwhile, the \\"Mother's League\\", a segregationist parents group, requested an injunction against the Little Rock School Board to prevent the nine students from attending the school. Segregationist parents also threatened to protest in front of the high school and physically block any black students from entering the school. Murray Reed, the chancellor of Pulaski County Chancery Court, granted the injunction on August 27, 1956, \\"on the grounds that integration could lead to violence.\\" Judge Davies, however, nullified the injunction on August 30 and ordered the school board to proceed with integration on September 3. Time Magazine. \\"Retreat from Newport\\". Monday, September 23, 1957. Despite the federal court's ruling, Governor Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to the school under the pretense of maintaining civil order. The nine black students attempted to enter Central High on September 4, 1957, but were turned away by the guardsmen. The deployment of the guardsmen brought international attention to Little Rock. President Eisenhower called Governor Faubus to his vacation home in Newport, Rhode Island on September 14, 1957, and warned him not to interfere with the Supreme Court's ruling.Front Pages of the Arkansas Democrat and Arkansas Gazette. Little Rock 1957. Attorneys from the United States Department of Justice requested an injunction against the governor's deployment of the National Guard, which Judge Davies granted on September 20, 1957. Davies ruled that Faubus had used the troops to prevent integration, not to preserve law and order as claimed. Davies ordered the Governor to remove the guardsmen. The Governor backed down and withdrew the guardsmen during the weekend. Afterwards the Little Rock Police Department attempted to sneak the nine students into the school on Monday, September 23, 1957. However, the nine were escorted out when angry parents of white students inside begin confronting the outnumbered police.Time Magazine. \\"Case No. 3113\\". Monday, September 30, 1957. The next day, the Mayor of Little Rock, Woodrow Wilson Mann, requested federal troops to enforce integration at Central High. President Eisenhower deployed the 101st Airborne Division to the school to escort the nine students and the division remained there for the remainder of the school year. The Mother's League petitioned Judge Davies to force the removal of the federal troops on October 17, 1957, but he dismissed the petition. Osro Cobb recalls that \\"a deluge of vile and threatening cards and letters\\" addressed to Judge Davies arrived at the post office in Little Rock. According to Cobb, > Much of it never reached him, but he knew about the quantity and substance > of the mail and showed me several letters that he had kept. Surprisingly, > more than half of the threatening mail came from the Chicago area.

The dance resembles twerking. This style of dancing and music was created by DJ Blass, hence his Sandunguero Vol. 1 & 2 albums. It is a dance that focuses on grinding, also known as perreo, with one partner facing the back of the other (usually male behind female). This is also known as \\"booty dancing\\" or \\"grinding\\" in the United States of America.  Origins  Sandungueo is a front-to-back dance, usually with a man facing the back of a woman. The moves focus on grinding and pelvic thrusts. They can be seen in music videos and night clubs. It is a rare form of dance in which a woman usually takes the lead. Taking the lead in the sensual experience of both parties was appealing to some women. Drawing on research conducted in Cuba by ethnomusicologist Vincenzo Perna (see his book \\"Timba, the sound of the Cuban crisis\\", Ashgate 2005), author Jan Fairley suggested that this style of dance, along with other timba moves such as despelote, tembleque, and subasta de la cintura, in which the woman is both in control and the main focus of the dance, can be traced to the economic status of Cuba in the 1990s and to the choreographic forms of popular music dancing of that period, particularly in relation to Afro-Cuban timba. As the US Dollar (which functioned as a dual currency alongside the Cuban Peso until 2001) became more valuable, women changed their style of dance to be more visually appealing to men; in particular, to yumas (\\"foreigners\\"), who had dollars. This tension between use of the female body as both an objectified commodity and an active, self-created persuasive tool is one of the many paradoxes dembow dancing creates in Cuba.Fairley, Jan. (2008) \\"How To Make Love With Your Clothes On: Dancing Reggaeton and Gender In Cuba\\". In Reading Reggaeton (forthcoming, Duke University Press).  Controversy  Sandungueo was the subject of a national controversy in Puerto Rico as reggaeton music and the predominantly lower class culture it derived from became more popular and widely available. Velda Gonz√°lez, a well known senator and public figure in Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic, led a campaign against reggaeton and specifically attacked the sandungueo style of dancing, which she marked as overtly erotic, sexually explicit, and degrading to women.Frances Negr√≥n-Muntaner and Raquel Z. Rivera, \\"Reggaeton Nation\\" (17 December 2007) Sandungueo has also been much criticized in Cuba. Part of the criticism may be due to its association with reggaeton, which, while very popular in Cuba, has also been heavily criticized for being degrading to women. Perreo has been seen as a departure from classical front- to-front dancing (salsa etc.) to back-to-front dancing. Some Cuban dancers argue that this puts women in control. Others have argued that it is un-Cuban, and the Cuban government seemed to agree when it banned reggaeton (which was sometimes referred to as Cubaton) in Cuba in 2012. A remix called \\"Perreo intenso\\" was one of the popular songs during the Telegramgate protests that led to the Puerto Rican governor, Ricardo Rossell√≥'s renouncing his position. An analysis of Puerto Rico's discourse shows politicians and reggaeton artists denouncing each other's corruption and immoral behavior, respectively. SWAT teams on hand, a () was going on in front of the governor's mansion when he announced his resignation.  Doble Paso  Doble Paso is a form of Sandungueo or Perreo in which the rhythm and the tempo of the songs is faster, resulting in a dance form which is more sexually explicit and intense. Doble Paso is mainly emerging and gaining popularity among Puerto Rican teens; thus causing parents and the conservative community to criticize this form of dance.

Early life Joseph Turner Dawson was the third child of Baptist clergyman Joseph Martin Dawson and Willie Turner Dawson and was born in Temple, Texas. His father, Joseph Martin Dawson was the minister of the First Baptist Church in Waco, Texas. He graduated from Baylor University in 1933 and pursued a career as a geologist, first with Humble Oil and Refining in Houston and then beginning in 1938 with the Ren-War Oil Corporation in Corpus Christi, Texas. Military career Dawson enlisted in the Army in May, 1941 as a private, and rapidly was promoted to corporal. He applied for admission to Officer Candidate School, and his application was accepted and he entered OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia, in December, 1941. He graduated in March, 1942 and received his commission as a second lieutenant. He sought to be assigned to the First Division, the fabled Big Red One, since that assignment offered the most immediate prospect for combat duty. He initially was assigned to the 1st platoon, Company A, 1st Battalion, 16th Regiment. After Gen. Terry Allen assumed command of the 1st Division, Dawson was assigned to serve on his staff. The 1st Division shipped out to Scotland in August, 1942. After further training, the Division embarked in late October for its destination, the invasion of North Africa on the coast of Algeria. Dawson waded ashore at Oman with Gen. Allen and his staff on November 10. The division fought across Algeria and entered Tunisia in January, 1943, where it first encountered German forces under Field Marshal Rommel. Dawson remained on Gen. Allen's staff through the conclusion of the North Africa campaign in Algeria and Tunisia and was promoted to captain in February, 1943. The Germans surrendered in Tunisia in May. The 1st Division returned to Oman to prepare for the invasion of Sicily, which began with amphibious landings at Gela on the west coast on July 10. During the campaign in Sicily later in July, Dawson was transferred from Gen. Allen's staff to the staff of the 16th Regiment, serving as regimental operations officer. In early August, in the midst of fierce combat operations, Dawson was assigned to command Company G of the 16th Regiment, a position he would continue to hold until the conclusion of the battle of Aachen, Germany, in October, 1944. After completing the defeat of German forces in Sicily in August, the 1st Division was then evacuated to England for training in preparation for the Normandy invasion. Dawson landed with his company at the Easy Red sector of Omaha beach early in the morning on June 6, 1944. After being pinned down on the beach, Dawson led his men up a narrow ravine, now known as \\"Dawson's draw,\\" from the beach to the top of the bluff on which the American cemetery now sits. He personally cleared a German machine gun nest with an accurate throw of a grenade. He is known as one of the first officers to reach the top of the bluff overlooking the beach. Once at the top, he led his men to his objective at Colleville-sur-Mer, where he was wounded on the afternoon of June 6. For his actions that day he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (United States), and at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings, Dawson was selected by the Army to speak at the ceremonies as the representative of the troops who landed that day. After recuperating from his wounds, Dawson rejoined his unit in France, and after the break out at St. Lo, he led his company in the advance across France and into Belgium, engaging in a number of actions against the Germans. From Belgium, the 1st Division was engaged in the battle at Aachen, Germany in September and October 1944. Dawson's G Company (along with I Company) held off German counterattacks for thirty-nine days during the battle for Aachen on, what was called in contemporary papers and is still called in U.S. Army history, \\"Dawson's Ridge.\\" This ridge sat astride the main route that for the German attempts to relieve the city of Aachen, which Hitler had ordered to be defended at all costs. G Company lost 117 out of 139 men during the battle for \\"Dawson's Ridge.\\" For this action, Dawson's command was honored with the Presidential Unit Citation. Dawson was hospitalized after the lengthy action at Aachen, capping his extended combat experience in North Africa, Sicily, and France spanning nearly two years. After recuperation at hospitals in France and the U.S., Dawson was promoted to major and was reassigned to the OSS under the command of General Donovan, serving for the remainder of the U.S. action in Europe during 1945 until the German surrender. Dawson was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and after leaving active duty in the Army in 1945 he served for a number of years in the Army reserves. He returned to Corpus Christi, where he continued his career as a geologist, working to develop oil and gas reserves in that region until just before his death. Later life Dawson married Melba Bruno in 1946. They raised two children, Roslyn and Diane. The Dawson family lived in Corpus Christi, Texas, and in Denver, Colorado. In civilian life he was a geologist in the oil industry. An elementary school in Corpus Christi, Texas is named in his honor. In June 1994, Dawson revisited Normandy to introduce President Bill Clinton at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the invasion.

Timothy Taylor's moved to larger premises in 1863 at Knowle Spring in Keighley, where they remain. The brewery is still family owned and was family run until 2014, when the Chief Executive Charles Dent retired and became Chairman. Beers =Landlord= Timothy Taylor's best known ale is Landlord, a pale ale, 4.3% abv when cask conditioned, and 4.1% when sold filtered in the bottle. It was created for miners, to compete against local rival Barnsley Bitter. Landlord was four times Champion Beer of Britain at the Great British Beer Festival. The brand attracted media attention in 2003 when Madonna said in an interview with Jonathan Ross that it was her favourite beer. Since then the draught beer has become more widely available throughout the country and Landlord is also being exported in bottles. Landlord is available in the brewery's own tied pubs, and is often available as a guest ale in other pubs, especially those in Yorkshire. Bottled Landlord is available in Tesco, Waitrose, Morrisons and several other supermarkets, as well as from the brewery's webshop. =Boltmaker= Timothy Taylor's Best Bitter was renamed Boltmaker in 2012 to better distinguish it from their ale Golden Best. Boltmaker won Gold in the Bitter category at the Great British Beer Festival in 2014 and was also crowned their Champion Beer of Britain 2014. Boltmaker is a Yorkshire Bitter which is 4% when cask conditioned or 4.2% when sold filtered in the bottle. It was originally bottled exclusively for Tesco shortly before winning Champion Beer of Britain 2014. In late 2015 bottled Boltmaker became available in other supermarkets such as Waitrose. =Knowle Spring Blonde= A brand new addition to the Timothy Taylor's range, a blonde beer Knowle Spring Blonde, will be available from March 2017. The 4.2% easy-drinking yet complex blonde beer is the brewery's first addition to their core range since 1952. =Others= Timothy Taylor's brewery at their current Knowle Spring site in Keighley. A variety of other ales, such as Golden Best, Dark Mild and Ram Tam (renamed Landlord Dark in 2019) may be found in Timothy Taylor's houses. A new French style blonde ale Le Champion was brewed specially to celebrate the 2014 Tour de France Grand Depart in Leeds. With the advent of the Tour de Yorkshire cycling event in 2015, Le Champion was brewed again in April 2015 and is being brewed again in March 2016. Timothy Taylor's also produce an occasional special bottled ale called Havercake Ale. In the past Timothy Taylor's produced another bottled ale called Northerner, bearing the advertising slogan, For Men of the North. This slogan has been reinvented as \\"Originally brewed for men of the north, now loved by everyone\\" and is borne on the back of the wagons. Brewery The brewery is supplied with water from an artesian well (Knowle Spring). Only whole hops are used for brewing. The yeast strain originally came from the Oldham Brewery. 80 percent of production is for cask conditioned products. Bottling is contracted to Robinsons Brewery. Pubs The Woolly Sheep Inn in Skipton is a Timothy Taylor's pub. Timothy Taylor's currently has 19 of its own tied pubs in Bingley, Cononley, Fence near Colne, Haworth, Grassington, Halifax, Keighley, Leeds, Malsis near Cross Hills, Oakworth, Oxenhope, Ripon, Skipton, Thornton and Wadsworth near Hebden Bridge. These are the Albert Hotel in Keighley, the Boltmakers Arms in Keighley, the Brown Cow in Bingley, the Burlington Arms in Keighley, the Crossroads Inn in Halifax, the Devonshire Hotel in Grassington, the Dog & Gun in Malsis, the Dog & Gun in Oxenhope, the Fleece Inn in Haworth, the Grouse Inn in Oldfield, the Hare & Hounds in Wadsworth, the Lord Rodney in Keighley, the New Inn in Cononley, the Royal Oak in Keighley, the Royal Oak in Ripon, the Town Hall Tavern in central Leeds, the White Horse in Thornton, the White Swan in Fence and the Woolly Sheep in Skipton. All of these pubs are run by tenants, except for the Lord Rodney in Keighley and the Woolly Sheep in Skipton, which are run by Timothy Taylor's itself. In 2015, Timothy Taylor's bought The Devonshire Hotel in Grassington and it underwent a complete refurbishment, reopening in December 2015.

The title is a play on the expression \\"There goes the neighborhood.\\" In the episode, a class war ensues in South Park when it becomes a hot spot for rich celebrities, all of whom are African- American. Meanwhile, Token feels rejected by his friends and goes to live with lions. Plot The children at South Park Elementary are presenting science projects. Token gets a \\"check plus\\" for presenting a computer model of predicted weather conditions, while Cartman is angry for receiving a \\"check minus\\" on his hastily constructed project and points out to the class Token's wealth in his rage, notably his clothes. Token, the token black child of South Park, happens to be the richest kid in town, and becomes upset when he can find no other kids in the school he can relate to. He tries to get himself and his family to act poor. They shop at J-Mart, where the rest of the families buy their clothes, but when he comes to Stan's house with the other boys and brings a DVD of The Lion King instead of a video tape‚ÄìToken's family being the only people in town with a DVD player‚Äìthe boys realize that he has not changed. Despondent at his social estrangement, Token decides to arrange for dozens of rich people (who all happen to be black) such as Will Smith and Snoop Dogg to move into South Park, which leads to Mr. Garrison complaining about the \\"richers\\" in the town, which in turn leads to ire among the other, less affluent members of the community (who all happen to be white). However, Token discovers that the rich kids (who are even richer than him) are as different from him as he is from the poorer kids in town. All the rich kids play polo, buy shops and speak with exaggerated English accents. Token feels so much like an outcast that he goes to live with lions in the South Park Zoo after the rich kids taunt him to do it, where Aslan is the leader of the pack. The situation between the rich and poor residents of town continues as the gentrification escalates. Led by Mr. Garrison, the townsfolk enact a series of measures. They decide to plant a lower case \\"t\\" cross for \\"time to leave\\" in the garden of some of the rich residents, setting it on fire to emphasize their point. They mock the rich residents by insisting they sit at the front of buses claiming it to be the \\"first class\\" section. They refuse to let them drink in the bars or eat in the restaurants. In response, the rich residents organise a Million Millionaire March, paying poor black residents such as Chef to attend. Token eventually decides he does not want to live with lions anymore (because they only play practical jokes) and leaves the lair. However, he finds the boys and discovers that the poor kids in town who made fun of him being rich didn't dislike him. They tell him that they only picked on him because they all pick on each other on a regular basis. They decide to stop ripping on him for his money, and instead mock him for his reaction to the previous insults as being a \\"pussy\\". Eventually, the townsfolk dress as ghosts (resembling Ku Klux Klan robes), resulting in the rich people responding with terror and fleeing the town. The poor townsfolk gather around their abandoned houses. Mr. Garrison suggests that by selling the empty houses the townsfolk can become rich. Jimbo and Randy tell him that if they do they will become the very thing they hate. Garrison shrugs, \\"Well, yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-\\", and the episode cuts to credits before he can complete the word.

He was best known for working over four decades with the American Broadcasting Company, spending much of that time anchoring newscasts for WABC-TV in New York City. He also was an ABC radio network newscaster before ABC Radio's split into 4 networks on January 1, 1968. After the split he reported on the American Contemporary Network as did his Eyewitness partner Roger Grimsby. Early life and career After a stint in the Army, Beutel graduated from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire and then studied law at the University of Michigan Law School, though he left Michigan without obtaining his law degree. While Beutel was in law school, he wrote Edward R. Murrow a letter saying, \\"I very much wanted to be a radio journalist.\\" Beutel received a letter back advising him to go to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. His first radio job was in Cleveland before moving to CBS Radio in New York City in 1957. Television career Beutel moved to ABC on October 22, 1962 as a reporter with ABC News and as anchor at the network's New York flagship, WABC-TV. WABC-TV built on its three-year ratings success with newscast Report to New York anchored by Scott Vincent, and expanded the format to a one-hour 6:00 p.m. newscast called The Big News. That expansion was not without risk however, and the new format struggled in the ratings. Among the hundreds of famous personages who were interviewed by Beutel was the African American Muslim and black nationalist leader Malcolm X. Beutel left his WABC duties for two years in April 1968 to join ABC News full-time as their London bureau chief. In 1970, he got a call from Al Primo, who had taken over as news director at WABC after Beutel left. Primo had brought the Eyewitness News format, in which the reporters directly presented their stories, along with him from KYW-TV in Philadelphia. He wanted Beutel to return to New York as co-anchor alongside Roger Grimsby, whom Primo hired away from KGO-TV to serve as WABC-TV's main anchor. Primo remembered Beutel's solo anchor run in the early 1960s. Since Grimsby had already established a powerful presence after just two years in New York, Primo wanted a co-anchor \\"who could be his own man.\\" Beutel assured Primo he could be. Beutel rejoined WABC-TV on September 28, 1970 as Grimsby's co-anchor on Eyewitness News. The two worked together for 16 years, most of which was spent going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place in the New York ratings. On January 6, 1975, Beutel was reassigned by ABC News and became the co-host (along with Stephanie Edwards) of a new morning show called AM America. This show, ABC's first attempt at a morning news program to compete with NBC's Today and CBS's combination of network news and Captain Kangaroo, lasted only ten months on the air. AM America was replaced on November 3, 1975 by Good Morning America, originally anchored by David Hartman and Nancy Dussault. Beutel returned to WABC-TV and Eyewitness News, though he maintained a presence on the network as the anchor of its 15-minute late newscasts on Saturday and Sunday nights through the late 1970s. The reformed Grimsby-Beutel team kept Eyewitness News on top of the ratings through the middle 1980s, when it briefly fell to last place. Though the ratings drop was mostly associated with ABC-TV's poor primetime performance during that time, it led to Grimsby's firing in 1986. However, within a year, WABC-TV had shot back to first place and has been the ratings leader in New York ever since. After Grimsby's firing, Beutel was joined at 6:00 p.m. by Kaity Tong and John Johnson in a rotating anchor arrangement and was permanently joined by Johnson beginning in 1988. In 1990 Beutel began a long stint anchoring the 6 p.m. news alone, which ended when his 11 p.m. co-anchor Diana Williams joined him in 1999. Beutel returned to the 11 p.m. Eyewitness News in 1989 after Ernie Anastos left to join WCBS and was originally paired with then-longtime co-anchor Kaity Tong. After Tong left WABC in 1991 Beutel anchored with Susan Roesgen for one year, but the pairing was unsuccessful and in 1992 Roesgen was replaced by Diana Williams. Beutel left the 11:00 p.m. newscast in 1999 and was replaced by ABC News correspondent Bill Ritter. In 2001 Ritter also replaced Beutel as the 6 p.m. anchor, and after that Beutel spent the final two years of his career serving as a senior correspondent and occasional commentator. In the latter role he was given a segment called \\"Final Thought\\", which aired at the end of the 6 p.m. Eyewitness News where Beutel gave a brief commentary on an issue of the day, usually a brief summary of the top stories/headlines of the newscast in one minute or less. Beutel retired from television in February 2003, having served as an anchor at WABC-TV for a total of 37 years‚Äîgiving him the longest run in New York television history until he was surpassed by Rafael Pineda, who has been anchor at Spanish-language station WXTV since 1972. Beutel remained the longest-serving anchor at an English-language station in New York City until April 2011, when he was surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough. His trademark sign off was \\"Good luck, be well.\\" Personal life Beutel was married four times. His first marriage was to Gail Wilder, which lasted twenty years and gave Beutel his four children, son Peter and daughters Robin, Colby, and Heather. He married actress Lynn Deerfield, twenty years his junior, in 1975 but the marriage was brief, as was Beutel's third marriage in 1977 which only lasted four months. In 1980 Beutel married Adair Atwell, a former tobacco industry lobbyist. Death Following his retirement, Beutel moved to North Carolina with his wife. A short while later, he was found to have a degenerative brain condition that was eventually diagnosed as Lewy body dementia. The condition progressed as Beutel aged and it eventually claimed his life on March 19, 2006 at the age of 75. Beutel was survived by his wife Adair, as well as his former wives, and his four children from his first marriage; he has since been joined in death by his son Peter, a businessman and energy sector analyst who died of a heart attack in March 2012, and his second wife Lynn Deerfield, who died in 2011.http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/obituaries/former-guiding-light-star- lynn-deerfield-dies/article_dd767e24-b52f-54fb-83bb-474afacd83bc.html References * Note: When Beutel was hired at WABC-TV, the news director did not like the sound of his last name, .

His Test batting average of 59.23 is the seventh highest of all time, and second only to Herbert Sutcliffe amongst Englishmen; against Australia alone Paynter averaged an extraordinary 84.42. Born in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, Paynter did not make his first-class debut for Lancashire County Cricket Club until the relatively advanced age of 24 in July 1926. He made a slow start to his career, however, not establishing himself as a first-team player until 1930 and only scoring his first century in July of the following year, making exactly 100 against Warwickshire in his 48th first-class match. He scored 102 against the touring New Zealanders in the very next game, and in August made his Test debut against the same opposition. However, the match was ruined by rain, with no play possible on the first two of the game's scheduled three days, and Paynter made just three in his only innings. Perhaps the most famous of his Test appearances came against Australia, on the \\"Bodyline tour\\" of 1932/33. At Brisbane Paynter was taken to hospital suffering from tonsillitis, yet with England in difficulty at 216/6 in reply to Australia's 340, came out to bat. After spending the night in hospital, he made his way to 83 and helped his team to an unlikely first-innings lead, and though he only fielded for a couple of hours, returned for the second innings and had the honour of hitting the winning runs ‚Äì with a six off McCabe. Paynter averaged a fine 61.33 over his five innings on this tour. Paynter was then out of the England side for a time, but in 1937 his county form ‚Äì 2,904 runs and a five-hour triple century against Sussex brought him a recall against New Zealand, as well as Wisden Cricketer of the Year recognition in the next year's Almanack. In 1938 Paynter had another outstanding series against Australia, averaging 101.75 and hitting 216 not out at Nottingham, at the time an England record for Ashes Tests in England. He also filled in very competently as wicket-keeper when Les Ames was injured at Lord's. Paynter was again very successful the following winter against South Africa, scoring three centuries and two fifties in eight innings, including 243 at Durban, to average 81.62. The Second World War brought an effective end to Paynter's career, though he did play a few special and festival games after the war. His final first-class innings was 75 not out for a Commonwealth XI against the Bombay Governor's XI in 1950/51; he then stood for one season (1951) as a first-class umpire. He spent the rest of his working life stacking wool in a Yorkshire mill.David Frith, Bodyline Autopsy, ABC Books, Sydney, 2002, p. 431. He died at the age of 77 in Keighley, Yorkshire.

The character appears in the X-Men family of books, and first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #316 (Sept 1994). Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Chris Bachalo, she originally was a member of the teenage mutant group Generation X (1994), and later X-Factor and X-Men. For a time, she was impersonated by her younger sisters, Nicole and Claudette. Monet is a Muslim superhero and has illustrated the struggle of accepting \\"different\\" people central to X-Men stories.'' Fictional character biography =Early life= Monet St. Croix was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia during a family ski trip and is the second child of the rich and eccentric Mon√©gasque Cartier St. Croix and his Algerian wife, who himself was the son of the French aristocrat Louis St. Croix and his second wife (implied to be also be Algerian).X-Factor Vol. 3 #200 Character history She grew up as a pompous and spoiled rich girl as a result of being the favored child of her father and his prestigious position as the Mon√©gasque Ambassador to France. She was also raised as a Muslim.X-Factor Vol. 3 #217 Shortly after her mother‚Äôs mysterious death, her brother Marius, the vampiric mutant known as Emplate, was banished from the St. Croix home. He eventually returned after learning the dark arts and requested that Monet join him in conquering another dimension. She cruelly rejected his offer, and after finally having enough of his sister's ridicule, Marius transformed her into a red-skinned, untouchable mute creature whom he nicknamed Penance. Monet's younger sisters, Nicole and Claudette, heard the commotion and quickly went to her room. When they could not find Monet, they assumed that Marius had killed her. The twins then banished him to another dimension while Monet followed, believing it was her only way to revert to normal. Afraid their father would break down after the loss of his favorite child, the twin sisters decided to merge bodies and replicate Monet. This version of Monet would have been identical to the original if it were not for Claudette's autism which would sometimes take effect, leaving \\"Monet\\" in catatonic stupors. Subsequently while the twins were impersonating their sister, they were among the new generation of mutants captured by the techno-organic alien race known as the Phalanx.Uncanny X-Men #316 =Generation X= The twins (still impersonating Monet) helped to battle the Phalanx until she and the other teenage mutants were rescued by Banshee and Emma Frost.Uncanny X-Men #317, X-Men #37 The group soon formed the Generation X team with Sean and Emma acting as co-headmasters of the new school designed to train them in the use of their powers. Shortly after the school opens, Banshee, Synch, and Jubilee go to the airport to welcome new student Chamber. The twins remain at the school and are reunited with the Australian teleporter Gateway, who they are glad to see and address as \\"Mentor\\". However, Gateway's return serves to warn them of the return of their evil brother. The twins convince Gateway to teleport them, Husk, Skin, and Emma Frost to the airport, where Emplate has already managed to absorb the powers of Chamber and Banshee. Though the twins recognize Emplate and address him as such, he says he cannot determine their name (despite the aspect of his mutant power that grants him \\"knowledge at a glance\\" with mutants, including their name, and more or less allowing him to read their memories). In addition, Emplate knows for a fact they are not Monet, as the true Monet has been his prisoner and main source of sustenance for years. Rather than face the full might of Generation X, Emplate decides to retreat. The twins try to stop him from fleeing, but are forced to stop telepathically by Emma, who saw Husk seriously wounded in the battle and desired to keep \\"Monet\\" from meeting a similar fate. The twins are furious at her interruption and warn her never to enter their mind again. Shortly after returning to the school, Gateway reappears on the front lawn, this time with the true Monet (having found her during the aforementioned battle, as Emplate returns to his hideout to find her gone), who is still trapped in the Penance body. Gateway utters a single word: \\"Penance\\", and this is assumed to be the unfortunate girl's name by the others.Generation X #1 The moment Penance wakes up, her overriding desire is to be free. She instinctively slashes through anything in her way with her razor-sharp claws to achieve this goal and escapes onto the school grounds. The twins immediately display both a detailed knowledge of Penance's plight (specifically her connection to her former captor, Emplate) far beyond even her teachers,Generation X #2 as well as a curious reluctance to physically engage the girl. While the rest of the team scrambles to try and capture Penance by force, Chamber merely lets her come to him, sensing that their mutant powers have made them both monsters and kindred spirits. Penance calms down in his presence, bringing the crisis to a peaceful end.Generation X #3 The team soon becomes aware of Monet's reoccurring, temporary trances, where she \\"spaces out\\" and is typically unresponsive for several minutes at the least (due to Claudette's autism). Monet later mentions (to the reader) that this most often happens during moments of intense focus.Generation X #13 Worse, as she is the only member of the team with actual super-strength, she proves completely unmovable until she emerges from the trances. An early occurrence of this trance state forces Synch, Skin, and Jubilee to abandon her during a trip to New York City, where they end up battling and defeating Hemingway of Gene Nation.Generation X #5 Monet eventually wakes up and reunites with the team, just in time to save Jubilee and Leech from being crushed by a falling slab of debris. Though Jubilee is grateful, she later points out that Monet would be a major liability if she ever spaced out in battle. Monet brushes aside her concern,Generation X #6 and continues to do so virtually any time her trances are mentioned in the near future.Generation X #12 During the Generation X Annual '95, the team is introduced to Cordelia Frost, Emma's younger and even less trustworthy sister, and her constant companion, the mutant Mondo, who is able to absorb both organic and inorganic matter, taking on its properties, as well as transport himself through these same materials. Mondo eventually joins the team, while Cordelia leaves. At the same time, Jubilee discovers and accidentally rips Monet's diary, which more closely resembles a children's coloring book. Penance later has something resembling a seizure while swimming with Jubilee, forcing Emma to give her psychic equivalent of a sedative. Penance remains unconscious in the medical wingGeneration X Annual '95 for the next two issues, with Jubilee as her most constant visitor. Almost immediately after Chamber saves the team from a near- fatal attack by Omega RedGeneration X #10-11 (Penance wakes up at some point between issues 11 and 12), they are again attacked by Emplate, who desires to have Penance returned to him. This time, Emplate has recruited a team of Hellions to do his dirty work‚Äîall of whom are under his thrall, including Gayle Edgerton, Chamber's former lover who was paralyzed when his powers first manifested. Gayle helps Emplate because she wants revenge on Chamber, but once Generation X is captured, he betrays her. Monet is the last to be captured, and Emplate reveals the first of several St. Croix family secrets to Generation X: that Monet is actually his younger sister.Generation X #12 However, he does not reveal to them that the twins have fused to become Monet, though it is clear from his choice of words that he is now aware of this as well. Monet manages to escape and contact the X-Men for help before the Hellions find her. The X-Man Bishop arrives to assist Monet.Generation X #13 He is disturbed upon learning of Monet's relation to Emplate, and reveals that hordes of \\"Emplates\\" will be a source of great trouble in the future. Meanwhile, Jubilee manages to enrage Emplate into absorbing her genetic marrow, knowing that because she cannot control her powers when she is angry, neither can Emplate. The resulting explosion of pyrotechnics frees Generation X, and Emplate flees with Penance, though it is unclear if she was taken against her will. They re-emerge before Monet and Bishop, and Bishop immediately tries to kill Emplate to spare the future from his taint. Penance confronts Monet, torn between killing her and helping her. Monet does not resist, hoping her death will atone for their brother's sins. Upon hearing this, Penance attacks Emplate, which shocks him into retreat. However, he reveals that he has converted Synch into his minion, and transported him to his hometown of St. Louis to feed on his own family and friends.Generation X #14 The team manages to stop Synch, though it is Monet who ultimately defeats him by daring him to truly synch with her. Whatever Synch finds inside her horrifies him and shocks Emplate's influence out of him, leaving only more questions in the team's minds about what else Monet may be hiding.Generation X #15-16 While the rest of the Marvel Universe was occupied with Onslaught, Emma, sensing the disturbance, tried to protect Generation X by taking over their minds, gently but firmly forcing them to accompany her to her home. While this did indeed protect them from Onslaught, it also left them basically defenseless against Toad, who Emma had allowed to live in her home. To correct this oversight, Nicole projected herself into Emma's mind for the first time (Emma of course mistook her for a younger Monet), explaining the situation so that Emma would release the team and talk sense into Toad.Generation X #18-19 Following this adventure, Generation X comes to the attention of Bastion of Operation: Zero Tolerance. For the time being, Bastion takes special notice of Chamber, Banshee, and Emplate, and their disastrous first meeting at the airport.Generation X #20 Bastion eventually figures out Chamber's identity, and upon learning that Chamber's plane ticket was purchased by Frost Enterprises, gradually comes closer to exposing Generation X's (and more importantly, the X-Men's) secrets. Monet enters one of her trances during a xenobiology midterm given by visiting professor Beast. Penance ventures into the classroom via the window and attempts to sit for the test, and though she only manages to shred her test paper, Emma considers it a plus that she is at least trying to fit in. Beast is fascinated when Monet re-emerges from the trance, having built a detailed origami structure out of her test paper. Beast reveals to Sean and Emma that Monet's trances likely have nothing to do with her mutant power, as they first thought. Instead, he recognizes the signs and says Monet is autistic.Generation X #21 Though Sean and Emma discuss treatment options and try to talk Monet into seeing a doctor, she abruptly destroys the school's cars on the scheduled date and refuses to go. Sean chases her into the sky, where she tearfully describes having been poked and prodded by numerous doctors as a child, and begs him not to make her go through that again. Sean agrees, though Emma insists that Monet simply manipulated him to avoid the problem yet again.Generation X #23 Emplate appears while Monet, Husk, Jubilee, and Emma spend the Christmas holidays at the St. Croix home in Monaco. He only reveals himself to Monet, and his presence seems to trigger in her the ability to view mutagenic auras, just as he does. Emplate invites Monet to join him, and failing that, asks her to find someone to take his place in the dimension where he is constantly torn apart. Monet cannot imagine condemning anyone else to such a fate, and Emplate vanishes into a sea of white hands that tear at his flesh.Generation X #24 Generation X is then attacked by the team of Sean's cousin Black Tom Cassidy and Mondo, who undergoes a fearsome transformation in appearance and attitude, having been shown waiting for Tom's signal (over the course of several issues) to reveal his true nature. Black Tom's plant manipulation completely transforms the school grounds, and he forces Sean and Emma to fight each other to the death in front of the captured team while Mondo captures Jubilee, who managed to evade them. Bastion finds Jubilee first, and protects her by killing Mondo, but then takes Jubilee hostage and transports her to his desert base in New Mexico. Emma uses her powers to force Sean to unleash his sonic scream, supposedly killing her in the process. Sean is rescued by Penance, who slices Tom in half with a single blow. Having discovered that the captured team was actually merely empty husks, Sean sets out to find Generation X. Unknown to him, they have been transported to a tiny island in the ocean.Generation X #25 Monet and Chamber try to protect their teammates, but the sheer hopelessness of the situation causes Monet to panic, and she attempts to fly away and get help, but soon exhausts herself and falls into the ocean. Synch pulls her back onto the island, but Monet has lost all hope. Emma recoversGeneration X #26 and searches Sean's mind, helping him realize where the team is.Generation X #27 Oddly enough, the team suddenly finds itself on a rusty ship at sea where their dreams seem to have been realized: Chamber's body is restored and he is dating Husk, Synch and Jubilee are in love and run a camp for kids, and Emplate is restored to the kind brother that Monet once knew. Skin, however, is tied to a pole because he will not make a request of Glorian, the Dream Shaper who rescued the team. He eventually convinces Glorian to send the team home, though Glorian assumes this means Skin's home of Los Angeles and sends the team there. Sean realizes that Black Tom planned to send the team to the sentient island Krakoa.Generation X #28 =M/Penance/M-Twins= Monet St.Croix, Art by Joe Madureira Skin leads the team through East L.A. in search of his cousin Gil. Monet inexplicably becomes very childlike and playful while at Venice Beach, but only Angelo seems to find this odd. Skin's ex-girlfriend Tores, tipped off by Operation: Zero Tolerance that he had faked his death, furiously corners the team with her gang at Gil's house in hopes of killing Skin. Prime Sentinels soon destroy the house, with Generation X, Gil, and Tores barely escaping in time and fleeing into the sewers. Meanwhile, Sean, Emma, and Penance intercept a distress call from the X-Men, who have been shot down by Operation: Zero Tolerance, and head to Emma's home in Miami in disguise. They are met by Emplate's henchman D.O.A., who arranges a deal: Emplate will reveal Monet's location (and thus the team's location), but in exchange for Penance.Generation X #29 Sean flat out refuses, but Emma knocks him out with a psi-bolt and proceeds with the deal. In L.A., Monet notices Chamber being purposely distant to Husk (because he suspects Skin and Husk are growing closer) and advises him to correct his mistake, which Chamber does. Monet also notices Synch having regrets, as there are many things he may never do if they die in the coming battle. He asks for permission to kiss Monet, and she agrees on the condition that it \\"doesn't count if we don't die\\", and kisses him first, leaving him stunned.Generation X #30 Back in Miami, Sean wakes up in time to punch Emma and calls for Penance, who instantly frees herself from Emplate's grasp, giving Sean a clear shot with his sonic scream. Though Emma desperately claims she wouldn't have really gone through with the deal, Sean does not believe her, tells her to stay away from the kids and the school, and leaves with Penance. During the battle against the Prime Sentinels in L.A., Tores briefly displays the mutant ability to harness psychic energy and direct it as a weapon. Generation X launches an ambush, but is quickly overwhelmed. Synch and Monet are wounded, and she urges him to synch with her invulnerability so he can survive the next wave of attacks, which he has never done before. As he does so, Synch glimpses Monet's true nature, calling her \\"M&M;\\" just before the attack. As planned, Gil then sets off a huge explosion to destroy the hideout and the Sentinels. Synch emerges from the rubble first, using his aura to locate Monet. Instead he finds Nicole and Claudette, each in a coma and separated for the first time since joining the team as Monet.Generation X #31 However, the secret of where the real Monet was would remain a mystery to the team. Soon after Emplate returned to terrorize the young mutants, the twins merged with Emplate, creating a new persona, called \\"M-Plate\\". When the three of them separated, the twins finally learned what their brother did to the real Monet St. Croix. Everett managed to convince Nicole to finally reveal the truth to the rest of the team. Immediately after Nicole's story, the twins formed back into \\"M\\" and then merged with Penance, freeing Monet in the process. Returning to normal, the traumatized M became self-reliant and outwardly harsh and defensive to make up for her fear and insecurity, causing her to clash with many of her Generation X teammates. The only person she allowed to see her vulnerabilities was Everett Thomas, with whom she started a brief romantic relationship. A rivalry soon started with her teammate Jubilee, which only intensified after Monet and Everett became an item. When Emplate returned during the school dance, Jubilee caused an explosion, which, once again, separated the twins from each other, and left the Penance body to become its own being. Upon hearing the return of the twins, Cartier St. Croix decided to visit his three daughters. Coming face to face with his severely injured son Marius, Cartier apologized to him. Marius then revealed that he was the one responsible for the death of his mother, further infuriating Monet. Monet was then transferred to an exclusive boarding school in the Swiss Alps. The school was burned down during a battle with its headmaster (a vampire) and M chose to return to the Massachusetts Academy. =Final days of Generation X= Synch dies in Monet's arms When Monet returned, she and Everett continued to grow close and began to intensify their relationship. However, Monet was the most devastated when Synch sacrificed his own life to stop an exploding bomb that had been placed in the academy by Emma Frost‚Äôs sister, Adrienne. After the tragic incident, the team rapidly began to fall apart, even as Monet began to open up and act more vulnerable around her teammates. Monet also began to observe Emma acting strangely villainous. After they found out Emma had killed her sister in retribution for Everett's death, the entire team questioned Emma's leadership abilities, particularly when combined with Banshee's relapse into alcoholism following the death of his lover, Moira MacTaggert. The school was promptly closed when the students decided their instructors were no longer fit to teach them. =X-Corps/X-Corporation= After Generation X disbanded, M temporarily joined Banshee's militant X-Corps with Husk and Jubilee in order to keep an eye on the devastated Irish mutant. However, the X-Corps were soon destroyed by Mystique, leaving M to join the X-Corporation's European branch, located in Paris, where she assisted Cannonball, Multiple Man, and Siryn in defeating Weapon XII. Monet helped the X-Men battle Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut before returning to her duties at X-Corporation Paris. =X-Factor Investigations= Following the events of House of M and the shutdown of X-Corporation, M, who also has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair,X-Factor vol. 3 #9 (Sep 2006) has opted to join X-Factor Investigations, a private detective agency run by Multiple Man. Monet completed her first mission on the team by telepathically tricking the famous actor, Jack Vaughn, to confess to the murder of Gloria Santiago's sister. Afterwards, Monet broke down crying in Jamie Madrox's arms, but quickly threatened to break him in half if he ever revealed her moment of \\"weakness\\". A comment made to Rictor seems to imply she no longer wishes to go by the name M. However, in a therapy session with Doc Samson, Monet stated that she hides behind the \\"M\\" persona so that others will not see how vulnerable she has become after the lengthy time she was held captive by her brother.X-Factor v3 #13 (Jan 2007) M and Madrox Monet also had a brief romantic fling with Madrox.X-Factor v3 #10 (Oct 2006) The tryst did not end well because Madrox was unsure whether he or his duplicate had slept with Monet while he or his duplicate slept with Siryn at the same time. While the two women initially refused to speak to each other, they eventually took a shopping trip to patch things up after being threatened by Layla Miller.X-Factor v3 #14 (Feb 2007) During this Paris trip, the two encountered a small anti-mutant mob marching on Paris' own Mutant Town, and were arrested by the Gendarmes for breaking the riot up. However, in a French prison, the mob leader bragged to Siryn and Monet that he and his mob had succeeded in burning down the building, which was why he had been arrested.X-Factor v3 #15 (Mar 2007) In response, Monet crucified the mob leader before she and Siryn broke out of the prison to check on the ex-mutants. When the two arrived, they found an abandoned girl whom Monet decided to take back to the States.X-Factor v3 #16 (Apr 2007) =World War Hulk= When the Hulk came to the X-Mansion to capture Xavier over his part in the Hulk's banishment from Earth, Monet and the rest of X-Factor came to help. During the fight, she said to the Hulk that she was virtually invulnerable, and he responded by kicking her to New Jersey. =Messiah Complex= M has a small role during Messiah Complex. She is seen along with the rest of the X-Teams and has a talk with Warpath about his feelings concerning his late friend Caliban and being a member of X-Force. Later, she aids Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos in locating the baby. She is present at the final battle on Muir Island. =Divided We Stand= M buys all the women of X-Factor Investigations an iPhone, but destroys Rahne's when she finds out she is leaving. She tells Rahne about how she is always telling her to feel and claims that since Layla is not coming back, she will keep her iPhone in mint condition until Rahne returns to X-Factor. She leaves, telling Rahne to not be a stranger, or stranger than she already is. She then goes to a bar with Siryn where Theresa reveals she is pregnant. Monet offers to be with her if she chooses to get it aborted, only to be told she is not taking that option. M also states that Theresa has embryos more mature than Jamie, and that \\"he would make a crap father.\\" Later Siryn tries to tell Jamie of her pregnancy but Monet realizes Siryn still loves Jamie. =Secret Invasion= X-Factor is employed by the estranged father of former teen X-Man Darwin to locate him. Monet, Guido, and Jamie find Darwin traveling with Longshot, who is later revealed to be a Skrull. The trio also come into conflict with She- Hulk and Jazinda, who are in pursuit of said Skrull. For some reason, She-Hulk gets very angry around Monet. After he is captured, the groups go their separate ways and reunite Darwin with his father. Monet is oblivious to the fact Darwin has a crush on her. =Operating out of Detroit & return to New York City = Shortly after the events of Secret Invasion, Darwin's father sells him out to a group of people called the Karma Project. While he is in a coma, Monet is called in to read his father's mind only to find nothing. Later the real Longshot shows up to help and Monet shows an attraction to him, though it is unknown whether it's Longshot's ability of having women fall in love with him or not.X-Factor #35 She then teams up with Madrox, Strong Guy, and Longshot in finding Darwin and is present at the birth of Sean.X-Factor #36-39 Val Cooper sends Monet, Guido, and Darwin to acquire a shipment of weapons designed to take out mutants, though instead they sink it to the bottom of the ocean.X-Factor #41 Monet later falls under Cortex's mental controlX-Factor #43 and proceeds to attack her teammatesX-Factor #44 until they are attacked by three Sentinels from the future. Monet is freed from Cortex's control by Longshot and when she attacks Cortex, she discovers that he is the second Madrox duplicate who was sent to the other future timeline during \\"Messiah Complex.\\"X-Factor #46-47 In the aftermath of the battle with Cortex, X-Factor unofficially splits due to tensions between Jamie and Terry. Guido and Madrox move back to New York while Monet, Darwin, and the others stay in Detroit in order to work under Terry. However, the Detroit team soon crumbles when a depressed Terry chooses to disband the team and move back to Ireland. Monet chooses to move in with Terry in order to keep an eye on her. Monet worries for her friend, who becomes increasingly withdrawn and even has a brief sexual fling with her former boyfriend Deadpool. Unsure of how to help Terry, Monet visits the team in New York in an attempt to get Jamie and Terry to work their problems out. However, upon arriving back at X-Factor headquarters, Val Cooper informs Monet that her father Cartier has been kidnapped by a terrorist cell that will behead him unless Monet surrenders herself to them.X-Factor #200 Monet and Guido eventually travel to South America to confront the kidnappers, only to have their plane shot down. Monet awakens in an illusion where she is led to believe that she is once again transforming into Penance. It is revealed that the mastermind behind the kidnapping is Baron Mordo, who plans to feed off Monet in order to combat his cancer.X-Factor vol 3. #202 After Strong Guy is resurrected by Layla Miller at the cost of his soul, Guido having no restraints, kisses Monet. Monet attempts to discuss what happened between them before being attacked by Rahne and Shatterstar's pursuers.X-Factor vol 3. #222 Monet becomes scared of Guido not having a soul and calls him a freak. She also gets into a heated argument with Theresa (Siryn/Banshee) about her not letting go of people's death.X-Factor vol. 3 #230 Monet becomes enraged after seeing Madrox alive, thinking that Layla was responsible for his resurrection. She slams Layla into a brick wall, then flies off with her into the New York skyline. Madrox tells Terry to fly after them, but Terry says that if Monet really wanted to hurt her, she would have done it right there. Monet drops her off at the Empire State building and scares the tourists away so she and Layla can have words. Monet says to Layla that she always knows what's going on. Layla states that this is not the case, and didn't resurrect Jamie. She uses the telescope as an example of her not knowing every event as the events get closer and then blackout. Layla then tells Monet that Guido was supposed to have died and not Jamie. She states she wanted to change fate so Monet wouldn't blame herself for Guido's death which would have resulted in her going through a year-long depression. She wanted to spare Monet pain, who, according to Layla, will eventually become her best friend. After hearing all this, Monet leaves Layla so that she can have some space and collect her thoughts.X-Factor vol 3. #234 Monet was shown to be dying from a serious brain injury when she fought Pluto, God of The Underworld, where he mercilessly beat her to near death until Wolfsbane's son intervened and killed Pluto.X-Factor vol.3 #253 Later in a fight with Strong Guy, M died due to the brain injury,X-Factor vol.3 #255 but is subsequently resurrected by Guido when he becomes Lord of Hell.X-factor #256 After the Hell On Earth Saga, Monet finds Darwin in Las Vegas. They have drinks at a bar, and he questions her where her soul went to after she died. Annoyed by the singer, she approaches him and explains that there is no heaven, but only nothingness or Hell. Darwin finally admits his feeling towards her only to be rejected. As Darwin leaves the bar, Monet aggressively corners him on wall, and tells him that she needs to feel something after her experience with death. The two end up having sex with one another. Darwin knows that Monet is not mentally prepared for a relationship, but is happy to be there.X-Factor #261 =X-Men Vol. 4= Monet has returned to The Jean Grey Academy after her event with X-Factor, to try to make sense on what to do with her life. Jubilee, her old teammate is surprised to see her again. She then meets Karima Shapandar and immediately forms a friendship with her due to both of them having an experience with death. Lady Deathstrike and her team see her jogging with Monet, and attempt to ambush them. During the confrontation, Karima is shot, and Monet manages to protect her temporarily, until Monet gets caught off guard. Before Deathstrike could finish her attack, Karima shoots and injures Lady Deathstrike causing her to retreat to regroup and get more intel. Monet explains to the X-Men that Lady Deathstrike's consciousness is now in the body of a teenage Latina named Ana Cortes. Storm asks Monet to help them figure out what her plan is. Monet, true to fashion thinks about herself stating that she's just there to take some downtime and is not interested in becoming the team's new bruiser. Jubilee, infuriated, says to Monet that Storm isn't asking. Monet agrees to help due to the fact that she feels guilty about Karima taking a bullet that she feels she should have stopped.X-men #7 =All- New, All-Different Marvel= In the wake of the M-Pox crisis, Monet joined Magneto's team of X-Men, with the goal of protecting mutantkind at any cost. During this time, she developed a love-hate relationship with the reformed Sabretooth, whom she frequently teased. They bickered so much that Psylocke tells them to just get a room, prompting Monet to ask if she was jealous.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #1 While investigating a mysterious illness and series of abductions that befell the MorlocksUncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #6 M and her teammate Sabretooth ran afoul of Emplate.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #7 She tried to distract him long enough so he would fade away, but as he did, he managed to possess M, cursing her with the hunger he suffered. Having been with her on the mission, Sabretooth was aware of what happened & later visited Monet in her room to tell her that her secret is safe with him & that she could feed on him whenever she needed.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #10 During a war between Inhumans and the X-Men, M and Sabretooth became part of the mutants who guarded over the Inhumans sent to captivity in Limbo. M began to feed on the Inhumans instead, wanting revenge & blaming them for the death of Madrox by releasing the T-Mist into the air. A fight broke out when Sabretooth tries to stop her, but at the end of the issue, he is willing to let her kill the last Inhuman to keep her curse secret. Sabretooth eventually ran away with her in order to help her contain Emplate's possession and find a cure.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #17 =Generation X, vol. 2= After somehow getting separated from Sabretooth, M continues hunting mutants to feed off of and ends up hiding out by the Xavier Institute, now located in Central Park, New York. After the X-Men discover that someone's been hunting mutants and draining their powers, Jubilee's students decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt the perpetrator but end up caught in M's ambush. Jubilee arrives to save her students, and upon seeing her old friend, M temporarily regains control of herself and immediately retreats.Generation X Vol. 2 #4 Monet hides out in an abandoned subway car, where D.O.A. brings in Morlocks for her & Emplate to feast on. Emplate warns M that Morlocks are not enough, and they need stronger mutant marrow to remain anchored to their plane of existence. M declares she's looking for a more permanent solution to their problem.Generation X Vol. 2 #8 M-Plate attacks the Xavier Institute, going after the students. She has D.O.A. use his abilities to disconnect the school from the outside world, cutting off any possible interference.Generation X Vol. 2 #85 The original teammates, Chamber, Husk, and Jubilee all fight M-Plate and are soundly defeated -Jubilee almost being killed by having her amulet torn off and thrown into the sunlight to burn. Thanks to the timely save of Quentin, he uses his Phoenix shard to cure Jubilee's vampirism & returning her mutant powers.Generation X Vol. 2 #86 M-Plate, having absorbed Hindsight's powers earlier now has his ability of seeing the past memories of whomever she touches. Bling comes up with the plan and touches M-Plate, the latter seeing her past. This freaks out Monet, with Emplate telling her to get a hold of herself. Bling gets word to the other previous Generation X team, and they all combine their efforts and grab a hold of M-Plate. Monet is panicked, with Jubilee apologizing to her & saying she needs to remember. All the memories of her time with the team come flooding back, which eventually breaks Emplate's hold on her, separating the two & finally curing Monet. Marius fades away to his own dimension and Monet is taken to the infirmary with the injured students. Jubilee watches after her, with Monet insisting that she's fine & just needs a manicure & a blowout. The two have a chat and Monet is her usually snarky self, with Jubilee smiling and complaining that she was almost happy Monet was back.Generation X Vol. 2 #87 =Weapon X-Force= Sometime after the events of Generation X, Monet fell under the mind-control of Mentallo and joined Stryker's cult, The Church of Human Potential. She lured Weapon X-Force there so she could share the gift with Sabretooth. She's freed from Mentallo with the aid of Deathstrike & teams up with Sabretooth's Weapon X-Force to take down the cult -even going into the depths of Hell to kill Stryker for good. During this final mission, she & Sabretooth reconnect with Domino, Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Deadpool believing them to have feelings for each other. It's revealed Sabretooth left M while she was possessed by Emplate and has regretted it for a while since she was one of the few to treat him decently after his inversion. Monet doesn't blame him due to how much of a monster she became but Sabretooth still felt guilty despite her understanding. He wants t her to know something, but is interrupted before he can tell her. Sadly, things end tragically before the truth can be revealed.Weapon X Vol. 3 #22-#26 Sabretooth is lost in battle facing a power-boosted Mentallo. Being overwhelmed by the former, Mentallo shot him with Domino's discarded gun, sending him into the blade machine as the final sacrifice in Stryker's resurrection. This devastated Monet, who screamed for him as he was sliced to pieces. Monet was present with Weapon X-Force during Graydon's resurrection. Mystique says Sabretooth is responsible but Monet sadly asks what happened to Sabretooth.Weapon X Vol. 3 #27 =House of X= M is later seen living on the sovereign nation of Krakoa constructed by X as the new mutant homeland for him and his people. She was amongst a host of heavy hitter X-Men selected to take the fight to the Orchis Group before they could bring the abominable Mother Mold online, whilst on their way to the Orchis Forge from their lunar base the team was met with heavy resistance by their opposing force.House of X #3 (Aug, 2019) After their ship was believed to have been dispatched by the Forge's armed forces, Husk and Archangel were found dead on arrival. The rest of the team went to work while Monet stayed behind with Jean to set up a telepathic relay for everyone to keep in contact with one another. The vessel they were on was eventually boarded and M shoved Jean out an escape pod while fighting to the death with Orchis's soldiers in her Penance form.House of X #4 (Sept, 2019) At a later date, thanks to The Five, who merged their collective power together in order to resurrect Monet as well as Warren, Jean, Scott, Paige, Logan, Raven and Kurt with help from a Cerebro empowered X. Monet was more than happy to be back amongst the living but was hesitant to receive a hug from Storm, the six heroes were well received by their fellow mutants back home; hailed as saviors of the highest caliber after giving their lives for preserving their newfound way of life.House of X #5 (Sept, 2019) Powers and abilities Monet is superhuman in essentially all aspects, possessing superhuman strength capable of lifting automobiles and snapping street lights with ease, as well as superhuman physical attributes like invulnerability, agility, dexterity, speed, reflexes & reactions, coordination, and balance. X-Man Bishop noted that M possesses a \\"superior excellent rating\\" in all human physical categories. She is virtually invulnerable, at least enough to withstand common firearms at long range and direct blows of the vastly more powerful Hulk and even has a healing factor, allowing her to heal and recover from wounds much faster. Her healing factor also makes her more resistant to toxins and disease, and possibly retards the aging process. However it seems that her invulnerability is (at least partially) psionic to some extent, as she is sometimes seen to be injured by lesser forces. Monet also possesses telescopic and night vision as well as superhuman acute hearing and it is possible her other senses are also enhanced. She has perfect memory and superhuman intuitive skills, for example she has been shown being able to reroute one of Arcade's robots to track the signal back to the source without knowing the exact specifications of this robot. She is able to psionically levitate and move herself in the air by force of will, allowing her to fly at supersonic speeds approaching Mach 3 and she manifested minor (or at least rather crude) telekinetic capabilities in the past, deflecting bullets X-Factor #218 or projecting thought waves as concussive force.X-Men Volume 4 #7 M is also a telepath with the ability to read minds, project her thoughts into the minds of others, and defensively mask her mind against telepathic intrusion. She has limited offensive capabilities, such as mind control and the ability to manipulate the memory of others. The range of her telepathy is generally limited to within a few feet of Monet. Furthermore, Monet also has the ability to view mutant auras. Monet and all her siblings are able to merge into different combinations with different powers, although merging seems easiest for the twins Nicole and Claudette. M is formidable in hand-to-hand combat and is of genius level intellect. It is unknown whether or not her mutations adhere to her intelligence. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= Monet never made a proper appearance in the harsh world known as the Age of Apocalypse. A girl referred to in the book as \\"Claudia\\" (which may be one or the two merged St. Croix twins) was known as Know-It-All and was part of Generation Next, having merged herself with the team's computer system. She risked her life to search the databases of Apocalypse, a task which ended in her destruction at the hands of the Shadow King. Know-It-All, Art by Chris Bachalo Claudette along with Nicole also appeared working alongside their brother in Apocalypse's Elite Mutant Force, going by the name \\"The Monets\\". Age of Apocalypse took place before Scott Lobdell, Monet's creator, left the X-books. His original intention for the character of Monet was for her to only be a fake persona used by the M-Twins when they were joined together. The appearances of Know- It-All and her sister in the Monets were intended as clues towards Monet's true nature in the regular continuity. After the fall of Apocalypse and the ascension of Weapon Omega to power as the new Apocalypse, he began resurrecting deceased Alpha mutants. The operation was interrupted by Prophet, however, who stopped most of the resurrections with the exception of Monet's. The connection between Know-It-All and Monet seems to have been abandoned by Marvel, at least for now. After returning to life, Monet renamed herself as Penance and began rallying mutants to her cause which was to seek forgiveness for their past crimes and to rebuild their world. She was soon approached by the servants of Weapon Omega‚ÄìAzazel, Prelate Summers and Colossus‚Äìwho asked her to meet Weapon Omega in order to discuss how she could service the citizens under him. Penance refused and used her telepathic powers to restore Colossus' memories, which caused him to side with her. She attempted to do the same for Cyclops but failed and was blasted for her troubles, leading to a fight breaking out between Colossus and Cyclops. Azazel agrees to leave and takes Cyclops with him, promising to return. Penance is immediately approached by Prophet, the leader of the human resistance who reveals that it was he that resurrected her in hope that she would aid them and that she would be more open-minded than Weapon Omega. Azazel returns with Weapon Omega, who has come to see her kneel before him, which she does. Just as Weapon Omega leaves, the Human Resistance arrives with Sugarman. Penance promises to be in touch with Prophet. =X-Men: The End= In the alternate future in the X-Men: The End series written by Chris Claremont, M is a member of the XSE and a critical part of the hastily marshalled forces attempting to defeat Mister Sinister. In other media =Television= * She appears in the episode \\"Badlands\\" of Wolverine and the X-Men. =Movies= * In the Generation X TV movie, she was played by Amarilis. The movie version displayed no psionic powers, and when describing her abilities, it mentioned only physical powers. Citizenship * Monet is a citizen of Algeria, Bosnia, and France with passports from all three. Despite her father being the Mon√©gasque ambassador to France (and therefore a citizen of Monaco), it has never been stated whether or not Monet herself is a Monacan citizen; is most likely that she is a citizen of Monaco (having grown up there and her father being a citizen), adding to her already three known passports.

Scotland: Story of a Nation. Harper Collins, 2000. Page 637. It describes the beginnings of a fictional third Jacobite Rebellion, and includes \\"Wandering Willie's Tale\\", a famous short story which frequently appears in anthologies. Composition Composition of Redgauntlet was swift and steady. It began very shortly after the completion of Saint Ronan's Well in early December 1823, and by early January 1824 proofs had reached the fourth letter. The first volume was in print before the end of March, the second was probably written in late March and April, and the third was certainly composed in May.Walter Scott, Redgauntlet, ed. G. A. M. Wood with David Hewitt (Edinburgh, 1997), 383. Editions The first edition was published in Edinburgh by Archibald Constable] and Co. on 14 June 1824 and in London by Hurst, Robinson, and Co. on the 29th of the same month.For a description of the early editions see Ibid., 394‚Äì97, and (for the first edition) William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, Sir Walter Scott: A Bibliographical History 1796‚Äì1832 (New Castle, Delaware, 1998), 599. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000 and the price one and a half guineas (¬£1 11s 6d or ¬£1.57¬Ω). It is likely that Scott was responsible for at least some of the small changes to the text of the novel when it appeared in the 1827 Tales and Romances (his involvement being with the octavo and 18mo formats rather than the intervening duodecimo). During January and February 1831 he revised the text more extensively and provided an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition, in which it appeared as Volumes 35 and 36 in April and May 1832. The standard modern edition, by G. A. M. Wood with David Hewitt, was published as Volume 17 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1997: this is based on the first edition with emendations mainly from the manuscript; the 'Magnum' material appears in Volume 25b (2012). Plot introduction The novel's hero is a young man named Darsie Latimer. Early in the novel he is kidnapped by Hugh Redgauntlet, and taken to a village in Dumfriesshire. Darsie's friend Alan Fairford sets out to rescue him. After much intrigue Darsie discovers that Redgauntlet is his uncle, and he is also reunited with his sister. He also discovers that a number of prominent Jacobites, and Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender) himself are staying in the village. Redgauntlet has summoned them all to start a new Jacobite rebellion, and he wants Darsie to join them. However, the Prince is still reeling from the French naval defeats at Quiberon Bay and Lagos, which represented Charles's last realistic chance to recover the British throne for the Stuart dynasty. Furthermore, Redgauntlet discovers that his fellow Jacobites are not as committed as he, and their stated objection is that they suspect the Prince's mistress, Clementina Walkinshaw, of being a spy. During these discussions, General Campbell arrives amongst them to announce that he and the government know what the conspirators are up to. The Prince is allowed to go into exile, and his followers peacefully disperse. Redgauntlet, seeing that the Jacobite cause is now lost, joins the Prince in exile. Darsie is set free having always remained loyal to the current king, and Alan marries Darsie's sister. Plot summary Caerlaverock, near Dumfries Darsie had been Alan Fairford's favourite schoolfellow, and, to please his son, Mr Fairford had consented that Darsie, who received an ample allowance on the understanding that he was to make no inquiries respecting his family until he completed his twenty-fifth year, should live with them. Alan was studying for the law, but his companion had started for his first country ramble, and the story commences with a long correspondence between them. As he returned from fishing in the Solway Firth, with Benjie as his instructor, Darsie was overtaken by the tide, and carried by Mr Herries, dressed as a fisherman, on horseback to a cottage, where his niece Lilias said grace at supper-time; and next morning he was placed under the guidance of Joshua Geddes. The Quaker, who was part owner of some fishing nets in the river, invited him to spend a few days at his house; and while there he heard from Alan that a young lady had called to warn him that his friend was in considerable danger, and to urge that he should at once return to Edinburgh. A letter, however, from old Mr Fairford determined him not to do so; and having made acquaintance with the blind fiddler, who told him a tale of the Redgauntlet family, Darsie went with him to a fishers' merry-making, where he danced with Lilias, who reproached him for leading an idle life, and begged him to leave the neighbourhood. Mr Fairford had arranged that Peter Peebles, an eccentric plaintiff, should be his son's first client, and Alan was pleading the cause before the Lords Ordinary when his father, by mistake, handed him a letter from Mr Crosbie, announcing that Darsie had mysteriously disappeared. Alan instantly rushed out of court, and started in search of his friend, who had accompanied the Quaker to await an attack on his fishing station, and been made prisoner by the rioters, of whom Mr Herries was the leader. After being nearly drowned, and recovering from a fever, he awoke in a strange room, to which he was confined for several days, when he was visited by his captor, and conducted by him to an interview with Squire Foxley, who, acting as a magistrate, declined to interfere with Mr Herries' guardianship. As the squire was leaving, however, Mr Peebles arrived to apply for a warrant against Alan for throwing up his brief, and startled Mr Herries by recognising him as a Redgauntlet and an unpardoned Jacobite. Darsie obtained a partial explanation from him, and was told to prepare for a journey disguised as a woman. Meanwhile, Alan had applied to the provost, and, having obtained from his wife's relation, Mr Maxwell, a letter to Herries, he started for Annan, where, under the guidance of Trumbull, he took ship for Cumberland. On landing at Crakenthorp's inn, he was transported by Nanty Ewart, and a gang of smugglers, to Fair-ladies' House, where he was nursed through a fever, and introduced to a mysterious Father Buonaventure. After being closely questioned and detained for a few days, he was allowed to return with a guide to the inn. Charles Edward Stuart in 1775 Darsie was also travelling thither with Herries and his followers, when he discovered that Lilias, who accompanied them, was his sister, and learnt from her his own real name and rank. He was also urged by his uncle to join a rising in favour of the Pretender; and, having hesitated to do so, was detained in custody when they reached their destination, where Alan, as well as other visitors and several of the neighbouring gentry, had already arrived. He was then introduced to a conference of Charles Edward Stuart's adherents, and afterwards to the prince himself, who refused to agree to their conditions, and decided to abandon the contemplated attempt in his favour. Ewart was, accordingly, ordered to have his brig in readiness, when Nixon suggested that he should turn traitor, upon which they fought and killed each other. Sir Arthur now learned that Fairford and Geddes were in the house; but, before he was allowed to see them, they had been shown into the room where Lilias was waiting, when Alan became aware that his fair visitor at Edinburgh was his friend's sister, and heard from her lips all the particulars of her brother's history. Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Benjie, in whose pocket a paper was found indicating that Nixon had communicated with the Government. During the confusion which ensued, General Campbell, a former military acquaintance of Herries, appeared, unarmed and unaccompanied, and after explaining that the Jacobites had been betrayed weeks before, announced that he was sufficiently supported with cavalry and infantry. The Rebellion was over before it could begin. His instructions, however, from King George were to allow all concerned in the plot to disperse, and he intimated that as many as wished might embark in the vessel which was in waiting. The Pretender was, accordingly, led by the Laird of Redgauntlet to the beach, and Lilias offered to accompany her uncle in his voluntary exile. This, however, he would not permit, and, after an exchange of courtesies with the general, the prince departed amidst the tears and sobs of the last supporters of his cause, and henceforward the term Jacobite ceased to be a party name. Lilias, of course, married Alan, and Herries, who had asked his nephew's pardon for attempting to make a rebel of him, threw away his sword, and became the prior of a monastery.

Conclusion: In a letter to the Author of Waverley, Dr Dryasdust presents the results of his researches into the subsequent careers of the main characters. Reception The reviewers of Redgauntlet were evenly divided into three groups: one found a welcome return to the author's best level, a second discerned virtues and defects in roughly equal measure, and a third saw no recovery from the nadir of Saint Ronan's Well.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews of \\"Redgauntlet\\" see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1821‚Äí1826: A Bibliography (New York and London, 1977), 178‚Äí79. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 259‚Äí61. A majority found much to admire in the strong and varied characterisation: Peter Peebles, Nanty Ewart, Joshua Geddes, and Redgauntlet himself were most often singled out, along with Wandering Willie, whose tale was pronounced the high point of the narrative. Several reviewers declared themselves weary of Jacobitism as a theme, and the unusual lack of love interest was a disappointment. There were differing views on the effectiveness of the plot, but it was widely felt that the correspondents in the first volume were insufficiently differentiated, unlike those in Richardson, and the double shift from letters to journal to conventional narrative was judged unsatisfactory. Literary significance and criticism In the introduction to the novel, Scott discussed the position of the former Jacobites: > Most Scottish readers who can count the number of sixty years, must > recollect many respected acquaintances of their youth, who, as the > established phrase gently worded it, out in the Forty-Five. ... Jacobites > were looked on in society as men who had proved their sincerity by > sacrificing their interests to their principles; and in well-regulated > companies, it was held a piece of ill-breeding to injure their feelings... Magnus Magnusson wrote: > Its two young heroes, Alan Fairford and Darsie Latimer (Redgauntlet's > nephew), between them reflect the duality of Scott's own character. > Fairford, an Edinburgh advocate, is the son of a strict, ultra-conservative > Edinburgh lawyer; Latimer ... is the young adventurer seeking to discover > the secret of his parentage in the wilds of Dumfriesshire. Alan Fairford is > Scott's Edinburgh self; Darsie Latimer is his Borders self. Between them ... > they discover an ultimate commitment to the Hanoverian peace. David Daiches wrote: > The picture of the slow disintegration of the meeting, of the embarrassment > of the Jacobites when faced with the problem of reconciling their fierce > protestations of loyalty to the House of Stuart with the realities of their > present situation, is brilliantly done. The scene is one of the finest in > Scott. The two worlds are finally brought together, and the romantic one > disintegrates.David Daiches. \\"Scott's Redgauntlet.\\" In From Jane Austen to > Joseph Conrad, edited by Robert Charles Rathburn and Martin Steinmann. > University of Minnesota Press, 1967. The early parts of the novel are in epistolary form consisting of letters between Darsie Latimer and Alan Fairford, or between Darsie and Saunders Fairford (Alan's father). It changes to third person narration from the court case where Alan represents Peter Peebles. The remainder of the novel is mostly third person, with some extracts from the journal of Darsie Latimer. One of the major highlights of the novel is \\"Wandering Willie's Tale\\", which occurs in the epistolary section. Wandering Willie is a wandering musician and the narrator of the tale. It is a ghost story with the climax being an encounter between Willie's grandfather, Steenie Steenson and the ghost of his landlord Robert Redgauntlet (Hugh's grandfather). All of the supernatural events have rational explanations which Willie mentions but vehemently denies.

The Truevision3D (commonly abbreviated as TV3D) engine is written in Visual Basic 6 and C++ and layered on top of the Microsoft DirectX API, currently supporting DirectX version 8. The engine is accessible from a number of programming languages including C++, C#, Delphi and Visual Basic (6 and .NET). The current version of Truevision3D is 6.3. Version 6.5, currently in public pre-release and very stable, includes significant updates to the engine, including DirectX 9 and shader support, as well as being rewritten in 100% C++. There are no plans to support DirectX 10 or XNA until a new version is worked on (TV7). Known issues Versions 6.2 and 6.3 have issues with C++ support, it is not possible for example to make it work in certain compilers. Version 6.5 works with any language that can utilize COM, managed libraries, or static libs. There is also a known issue between the version 6.3 on Windows Vista since it needs a dll from DirectX 8 which Vista does not have and it is contractually illegal to simply add it. Microsoft has been contacted regarding this issue but has not demonstrated in their forums any will to include the dll. Features Version 6.5 is a complete development solution which includes 3D, Media, and Network Engines. Included with the SDK are multiple tools to help speed up development: a shader editor, model viewer, exporting plugins for various modeling software (3D Studio Max, Maya, and Milkshape 3D currently) and particle effects editors. Because version TV3D 6.5 no longer supports outdated mesh formats, many converters are also available. An official world or map editor is not currently planned because it hinders the end-user, since there is no way one editor can be used for every project this engine is used for. Furthermore, TV3D is a 3D engine, not a game engine, and an official editor would limit it too much. However, there are some user-created map editors available. Truevision3D is free to use as long as the user doesn't mind a logo in the corner of the rendering viewport. To remove the logo and publish a commercial project, a license needs to be acquired. Currently, the cost is $150 for a single-title license, $500 for a multi-title license. A source license can be purchased for an as yet undisclosed price. =Languages Supported= * Visual Basic 6 (VB6) via ATL/COM Library * Visual Basic.Net (VB.Net) via Managed Library * C# via Managed

First used at Liverpool Street station, it was then adopted by the Design Research Unit (DRU) as part of their comprehensive 1965 rebranding of the company.Design Museum - Jock Kinneir + Margaret Calvert. Retrieved 1 July 2010. Rail Alphabet is similar to a bold weight of Helvetica, but with some differences in character shapes, stroke width and x-height to aid legibility. The font also has some similarities to Akzidenz-Grotesk, which had earlier provided the same designers the broad inspiration for the Transport typeface used for road signs in the United Kingdom. The font was designed specifically for signage and the designers included features to support this such as a bespoke letter-spacing system and two slightly different weights to provide optimum visibility on both light and dark backgrounds. British Rail In 1949 the Railway Executive decided on standard types of signs to be used at all stations. Lettering was to use redrawn versions of Gill Sans lettering on a background of the regional colour.Standard Stations Signs The Railway Magazine issue 582 July 1949 page 271 This style persisted for nearly 15 years. In the early 1960s, British Rail trialled new signs at Coventry station that made use of Kinnier and Calvert's recently launched Transport typeface. While Transport has since been an enduring success on road signs, it was designed around the specific needs of road users - such as visibility at speed and in all weathers. The subsequent creation of Rail Alphabet was intended to provide a style of lettering more specifically suited to stations where it would primarily be viewed indoors by pedestrians.https://thebeautyoftransport.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/on-line- typeface-rail-alphabet-typeface-uk/ The Design Research Unit's 1965 rebranding of British Railways included a new logo (the double arrow), a shortened name British Rail, and the total adoption of Rail Alphabet for all lettering other than printed matterhttp://www.doublearrow.co.uk/manual/1_10.1965-04.jpg including station signage, trackside signs, fixed notices, signs inside trains and train liveries. Key elements of the rebranding were still being used during much of the 1980s and Rail Alphabet was also used as part of the livery of Sealink ships until that company's privatisation in the late 1980s. However, by the end of the 1980s, British Rail's various business units were developing their own individual brands and identities with use of Rail Alphabet declining as a consequence. The typeface remained in near-universal use for signs at railway stations but began to be replaced with alternatives in other areas, such as in InterCity's 1989 Mark 4 passenger carriages which made use of Frutiger for much of their interior signage. Post British Rail The privatisation of British Rail from 1994 accelerated the decline in use of the typeface on the railway network with most of the privatised train operating companies who now manage individual stations choosing to use the fonts associated with their own corporate identities for station signs and publicity. More recently, the custom Brunel typeface introduced by Railtrack for signs at major stations and adapted by Network Rail as NR Brunel was recommended as a new national standard for station signs by a 2009 report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Transport, and was used extensively by South West Trains and East Midlands Trains. Meanwhile, Helvetica Medium has replaced Rail Alphabet as the industry's preferred typeface for safety notices within passenger trains due to the ready availability of the former and for consistency with British Standards on general safety signs. Some train operators continued use of Rail Alphabet long into the privatisation era. Arriva Trains Wales used the font until the end of the franchise in 2018, with First Great Western also making extensive use of Rail Alphabet for signage until the firm's rebranding to Great Western Railway in 2015. Merseyrail continues to use the typeface for station signage. Its use is also still prescribed for trackside warning signs and safety/operating notices. Other uses The National Health Service in England, Scotland and Wales adopted Rail Alphabet for its signs. It is still the dominant typeface used on signs in older hospitals. It ceased to be used in new builds in the late 1990s. NHS England now uses Frutiger, while NHS Scotland uses Stone Sans. Rail Alphabet was widely used on signs by the British Airports Authority and by Danish railway company DSB. New Rail Alphabet In 2009, a newly digitised version of the typeface was publicly released. Created by Henrik Kubel of A2/SW/HK in close collaboration with Margaret Calvert, New Rail Alphabet features six weights: off white, white, light, medium, bold and black, with non-aligning numerals, corresponding italics and a set of Eastern European characters. Rail Alphabet 2 In 2020, it was announced that Network Rail had commissioned an updated version of the typeface. Designed by Margaret Calvert and Henrik Kubel, Rail Alphabet 2 includes a lighter, more condensed version of the lettering for signage along with accompanying versions for use in printed matter and online.

College career A two-time (1998‚Äì99) Associated Press \\"Little\\" All-America selection at West Chester (Pa.) University, Ingram holds the all-time school records for catches (235) and receiving yards (3,159). He is also second all-time in touchdown receptions (45) and points scored (278), and fifth in all-purpose yardage (3,507) for the Golden Rams. In 1999, Ingram was chosen as the PSAC East Player of the Year after making 82 catches for 1,050 yards and 16 touchdowns. Ingram holds an NCAA record for yards in a game with 401 yards on 13 catches.  Arena Football career Kevin Ingram, one of the Arena Football League's premier players, lead the Los Angeles Avenger's franchise in games played (98), receptions (536), all-purpose yards (9,523), kickoff return yards (2,871) and first downs (308). He also has made a significant contribution on defense during his seven-year Avenger career, ranking second in team history in both tackles (308.5) and interceptions (25). Ingram has returned three of his team-record 25 interceptions for touchdowns and also has scored three times as a kickoff returner and twice as a runner. In 2005, Ingram was honored with the AFL's most prestigious individual award when he was selected as the \\"U.S. Army Ironman of the Year,\\" which is given to the league's top two-way player. Ingram has returned three of his team-record 24 interceptions for touchdowns and also has scored three times as a kickoff returner and twice as a runner. In 2008, Ingram caught 97 passes for 999 yards and 23 touchdowns. In 2007, he caught 103 passes for 1,196 yards and 26 touchdowns in just 11 games. A fractured right thumb sidelined Ingram for five regular-season games. He averaged a career-high 142.7 all-purpose yards per game for the 2007 Avengers. In 2006, Ingram led Los Angeles in receiving with 111 catches for 1,354 yards and 32 touchdowns, which are all career highs. On the other side of the football, he had 47 tackles and a team-high five interceptions. On April 9, 2006, Ingram had a career-high four touchdown receptions at Kansas City. In 2005, he was selected as the AFL's U.S. Army Ironman of the Year, after having an outstanding season in all phases of the game. On offense, Ingram led the team with 88 receptions for 1,052 yards and 23 touchdowns. Defensively, he led the Avengers with six interceptions and was second on the club with 68 tackles. In addition, Ingram led Los Angeles in kickoff returns and averaged a team-high 104.1 all-purpose yards per game. After that stellar performance, it was no surprise that he was named to the league's All-Arena first team and All-Ironman squads for the second consecutive season. Ingram was named the U.S. Army Ironman of the Game six times during the 2005 season. His most memorable game occurred on May 7, 2005, when he returned one of his three interceptions for a touchdown with 31 seconds remaining to lift the Avengers to a 54-42 victory at San Jose, which put Los Angeles in position to capture its first Western Division title. In 2004, Ingram was also a strong candidate for \\"U.S. Army Ironman of the Year\\" honors after catching 67 passes for 848 yards and 22 touchdowns. He also led the 2004 Avengers in kickoff returns (50 for 956 yards) and tackles (76.5). In addition, Ingram tied for the team lead in interceptions with four. He was voted the \\"Ironman of the Game\\" five times in 2004, and was selected by the AFL as the \\"Defensive Player of the Week\\" after deflecting a pass with no time remaining to preserve a 62-55 victory over Las Vegas on Feb. 14, 2004. Ingram also was a strong candidate for All-Arena and All-Ironman honors in 2003, before a fractured fibula cost him the final three games of the season. He wound up the 2003 campaign with 35 receptions for 355 yards and 10 touchdowns. Ingram also was second on the team with four interceptions and third in tackles with 43.5. He was voted the \\"Ironman of the Game\\" four times in 2003, and selected by the AFL as \\"Ironman of the Week\\" after he caught two touchdown passes, had an interception, a fumble recovery and five tackles in a victory over Grand Rapids on March 23. Ingram started 13 games for the Avengers in 2002, finishing with 36 receptions for 389 yards and six touchdowns (third on the team in all three categories). On the defensive side, Ingram tied Greg Hopkins (who won the AFL \\"Ironman of the Year\\" award that year) for the team lead in interceptions with five. He had a breakout game and earned game \\"M.V.P.\\" honors on the road against the Toronto Phantoms on June 27, 2002, catching a team-high five passes for 92 yards and a touchdown, while also intercepting a pass in the last minute and returning it 49 yards for the game- winning score. As a rookie with the Indiana Firebirds in 2001, Ingram got caught in the shuffle behind two of the best receivers in league history (\\"Touchdown\\" Eddie Brown and Greg Hopkins). He was acquired by the Avengers in a trade on Dec. 10, 2001. He was named First Team All-Arena in 2004 and 2005. He was also named Second Team All-Arena in 2006.

Bill Ritter was named co-anchor of WABC-TV New York's Eyewitness News at 6 p.m. in February 2001. Ritter, who has been the co-anchor of the 11 p.m. news since September 1999, is also a correspondent for the ABC News program 20/20. He started at Eyewitness News in the summer of 1998 as a weekend anchor. For Eyewitness News, Bill traveled to Israel the week before the start of the war in Iraq, to find out how Israelis and Palestinians were preparing for a possible military conflict 500 miles from their land. Bill has investigated drug use among some teenage Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, and looked into problems with the dramatic increase in the number of building scaffoldings in New York. Bill also covers fire safety and prevention for Eyewitness News, and hosts the annual \\"Operation 7 Save A Life\\" a special and campaign. Bill has climbed the Empire State Building, tagging along with the man who repairs and replaces the broadcast antennas on top of one of New York's tallest skyscrapers. And, for the first time on live television, Bill was tested for prostate cancer. As part of the test, Bill also interviewed New York's most famous prostate cancer patient: former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bill used to write a daily column, Behind the News with Bill Ritter, which previewed the 11 pm edition of Eyewitness News. It was sent via e-mail, and regularly offered insights into how we gather the news. Career =KTTV= Previously, the Los Angeles native reported on the Rodney King trial and the subsequent Los Angeles riots for the Fox Television Network. From August 1991 through February 1992, Ritter also served as a reporter for the Fox Network's nationally syndicated show Entertainment Daily Journal (E.D.J.); and from February 1990 to August 1991 was an investigative reporter for KTTV-TV (Fox Television) in Los Angeles. He also was an anchor for the station's Gulf War coverage. =KNSD= While serving as a business, then investigative reporter for KNSD, the NBC affiliate in San Diego, from February 1987 to January 1990, Ritter, known for his white-collar crime investigations, captured four Emmy Awards. In 1989 he was honored for his investigative reporting in uncovering a local stock swindle, as well as for his \\"overall journalistic enterprise.\\" In 1987, he also won in both of these categories, this time for his reports exposing a safety scandal involving killer whales and their trainers at San Diego's Sea World of California. Ritter also was named NBC Affiliate Reporter of the Year in 1987 and 1988. =KCAL= Prior to joining ABC, Ritter was a reporter for KCAL-TV, the former Disney-owned independent station in Los Angeles, from June to December 1992, where his \\"Up Front\\" segment headlined the station's successful 9 p.m. weeknight news broadcast, showcasing his perspective of the day's top national or international story. ABC News =Good Morning America Sunday= Before joining Eyewitness News, Bill worked at ABC News in January 1993 as co-anchor of Good Morning America Sunday. Since then he has covered dozens of important news stories for Good Morning America, including the crash of TWA Flight 800, the death of Princess Diana, the criminal and civil trials of O.J. Simpson, the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing and the devastating Midwest floods of 1997. Ritter's feature reporting for GMA includes revealing interviews with boxers Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield, golfers Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, former evangelist Jim Bakker and Peanuts cartoonist Charles Schulz. He also contributed to GMAs series, which included in-depth looks at drugs and teenagers, the alarming increase in \\"budget\\" plastic surgeries and the emotional consequences of so- called \\"blended\\" or step families. =20/20= For 20/20, Ritter has reported stories that run the gamut from light-hearted to heart-warming to deadly serious. He investigated the claims of James Van Praagh, the supposed psychic who says he can talk to the dead; he covered the Columbine shootings; he investigated the phenomenon of patients waking up during surgery; he reported on \\"slip and fall\\" scams at casinos across the nation; he reported on a New York man who died while donating his kidney to his wife, whose family says the doctor left the O.R. before the surgery was completed; he examined the effects of parental anger on kids by having cameras in several homes for several weeks; he debunked the so-called urban legends that sprung up in the wake of September 11; and he followed a group of female Army recruits as they went through a grueling nine weeks of basic training. On the lighter side, he has paraglided off an 11,000-foot mountain in Aspen, scaled a rock face in Jasper, Canada, \\"posed\\" as a bull-clown at a rodeo in Texas and was the first non- Barnum and Bailey employee to perform on a trapeze for that circus. Eyewitness News In September 1999, Ritter was officially named to co- anchor Eyewitness News 11pm broadcast with Diana Williams and seventeen months later in February 2001 was added to co-anchor the 6pm edition of the newscast as well. In 2003, upon Williams move to the 5pm broadcasts, Ritter was joined at 6 & 11pm by Liz Cho. In 2011, 5pm anchor Sade Baderinwa replaced Cho at 11pm alongside Ritter when Cho was asked to launch the newly created 4pm newscast alongside David Navarro in the time-slot occupied for the prior 25 years by the Oprah Winfrey Show. On September 13, 2019 Ritter was named the new co-anchor of the 5pm edition alongside Baderinwa, replacing Diana Williams who had retired from the station after 29 years and had her last broadcast the day before. Personal life Ritter was born to a Jewish family. In 1972, he was expelled from San Diego State University for protesting the Vietnam War; at the time he was one semester short of graduating. At his daughter's suggestion 40 years later, he decided to complete his college education, receiving a degree from The New School on May 20, 2016.

They have also been involved in developing medical and other services among minority language groups. Early life Not many sources report the details of William ‚ÄúCam‚Äù Townsend before he began work as a foreign missionary. Born in 1896 in Southern California, Townsend graduated from Compton High School and attended Occidental College in Los Angeles, but dropped out to serve for several years as a Bible salesman for the Los Angeles Bible House.Eunice Victoria Pike in A William Cameron Townsend en el Vigesimoquinto Aniversario Del Instituo Linguistico de Verano (Mexico, D.F.: La Tipografica Indigena Cuernavaca, 1961). Work in Guatemala Under the auspices of the Los Angeles Bible House he sailed to Guatemala in 1917 to sell Spanish Bibles near Antigua. After two years he joined the Central American Mission (CAM), an evangelical Christian mission founded by some of the 19th century's more prominent Protestant revivalists who had agreed to divide their mission work in Central America into various regions. CAM taught that Jesus Christ's Millennial Kingdom of Peace would come after the Second Coming of Christ and viewed their mission as necessary to fulfill Christ's Great Commission to carry his message \\"to the ends of the earth\\" (Acts 1:8). Unlike his predecessors, Townsend did not deem social reform as a wasted effort. He was also concerned that CAM's Christian message, spread exclusively in Spanish, could not reach the monolingual majority of the indigenous population.Gerard Colby and Charlotte Dennett, Thy Will Be Done: The Conquest of the Amazon : Nelson Rockefeller and Evangelism in the Age of Oil (New York: Harper Collins, 1996). Townsend settled in a Kaqchikel community on the coast called Santa Catarina, and over the next fourteen years learned the language to the point where he could translate the Bible. He also founded the Robinson Bible Institute which, with financial backing from U.S. sources, built a center for the indigenous community that included a school, medical clinic (supplied with effective western treatments for prevalent parasites like hookworm), an electrical generator, a coffee processing plant, and an agricultural supply store.David Stoll, Fishers of Men or Founders of Empire? : The Wycliffe Bible Translators in Latin America (London: Zed Books, 1983). During these years, Townsend's concern for the impoverished and excluded condition of the Latin American Indians grew, and he became convinced that the missionary practices he observed did not address the needs of indigenous people groups effectively, and did not take into account their diverse languages and cultures. =Search for solutions= As Townsend sought the root causes of indigenous poverty and marginalization, he found them first in the mixed-race ‚Äòladino‚Äô middlemen who acted as the sole economic and social portal to the broader regional and national society for mainly monolingual indigenous communities, and who were closely associated with a \\"folk\\" Catholic religion that was quite distinct from orthodox Catholicism. These elites had a vested interest in maintaining the economic and social status quo, and therefore had no desire to improve the Indians‚Äô economic situation, educational level or degree of bilingualism. Secondly, Townsend, while valuing indigenous languages and cultures as divine creations, also believed that not all aspects of human culture were positive, including some of those found within Mesoamerican indigenous societies. Within them he found various types of oppression, some of which were similar to those the dominant Spanish culture imposed. Numerous saints required many days of festivals laden with the obligatory purchases and excessive consumption of food and alcohol, much of which needed to be purchased from the ladino middlemen. Modern healthcare was not available in most communities, which were served only by spiritualist ‚Äòcurers‚Äô who required payment but often provided ineffective care. Townsend thus viewed the Maya who surrounded him as trapped from both within and without, and he searched for an exit strategy, a way to liberate them from the forces holding them back. Problems to address Townsend viewed true conversion to Christ as the ultimate way out for indigenous peoples, but he had to first confront the question of why the current Protestant missions did not attract many indigenous converts, and why Catholic missions had failed to produce Christians who were more orthodox in their beliefs. The primary answer he found was that the illiterate monolinguals had no access to scripture. Many Indians could not read, and even those who could, did not have the Bible in a language they could understand. Although heterodox syncretism was the norm in indigenous communities, the Catholic clergy refused Bible translation, fearing negative exegesis. The Protestant missions concentrated on Spanish-speaking ladino overseers as converts instead of on the speakers of minority indigenous languages. According to Colby and Dennet (a less-than-objective and not very reliable source), Townsend's CAM superiors also showed signs of unease that he had adopted indigenous cultural practices, clothing, and language. In the end, Townsend developed a philosophy of mission that sought to produce indigenous-run, self-sufficient, Bible-based Christian congregations. He believed that if this goal were achieved, it could also contribute to a positive restructuring of cultural institutions that could lead to a more just society. To promote that, he included various parallel programs alongside Bible translation to provide prerequisite knowledge and skills to indigenous communities. One very important step toward this goal was the development of groups of indigenous people who were literate, first in their own language and later in Spanish as well, and to help them produce a translation of at least the New Testament and key parts of the Old Testament in their native tongue. Townsend firmly believed that if the Christian Scriptures were well translated and well understood, they had the power to change individuals and society for the better. He often said that the Bible in the language of the people was the best missionary of all, because it never got sick, never took a furlough, and never sounded like a foreigner. The importance of linguistics in Bible translation Townsend realized that, in order to meet the goal of well-translated Scriptures, Bible translators needed to complete an in-depth study of descriptive linguistics. This emergent academic specialty, freshly invigorated by the first widespread publications of Edward Sapir (1921)E. F. K. Koerner and R. E. Asher, A Concise History of the Language Sciences (Oxford: Pergamon, 1995), p. 297. and Leonard Bloomfield (1933)Pieter A. M. Sueren, Western Linguistics (Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1998), p. 193. could provide Townsend's translator recruits with the deeper understanding of language they needed to do translation well. Having already used some of Sapir's insights in his analysis of Kaqchikel, Townsend understood the importance of linguistic theory in the training of those who would translate Scripture into many indigenous languages. Once given access to the rural communities, they would work with local language speakers to learn their language, produce an alphabet for that language, publish literature that preserved local stories, histories, folk tales and other aspects of the culture, develop literacy materials and set up literacy programs, help provide modern healthcare and supplies, and eventually complete Bible translation work. Translation and conversion thus would happen in the context of a series of developments in the society that would equip minority people groups to cope with the outside world more effectively. Where to send the first linguist/translators As this Bible translation movement developed, Townsend moved from Guatemala to Mexico to Peru, with a special focus on the vast Amazon basin. For centuries the tribes of the Amazon had been evangelized by the Jesuits until their expulsion from the Portuguese empire in the late eighteenth century. It had been targeted by slave catchers, rubber tappers, and even some military operations. Many of the Amazonian indigenous groups remained elusive, always relying on the size and inhospitable nature of the terrain to fade away and maintain isolation.. Townsend proposed using airplanes, and a radio network to contact and to stay connected with the isolated tribes, but the complexity and cost of such an operation baffled less technologically minded missionaries. In the opinion of some, individual Bible translations would be incredibly labor-intensive and reach only tiny populations there. Also, as mentioned, the concept of indigenous-run congregations in native tongues ran counter to the traditional practices of more traditional evangelical missionaries in Guatemala. Sometime between 1931 and 1933 Townsend decided to move to Mexico as the initial operational theater instead of to the Amazon. The first piece fell into place in Panajachel, Guatemala, when he met by chance (or divine arrangement) with Mois√©s S√°enz, Mexican Under-Secretary of Education, who was vacationing and visiting rural schools. The two became friends. S√°enz left a letter expressing his commendation of Townsend's work in Guatemala and his offer to welcome him to Mexico.Jan Rus & Robert Wasserstrom in Hvalkof & Aaby, 164. Sick with tuberculosis and convinced that there would be little support for his ideas in Guatemala, Townsend returned to the United States in 1932 and sought the help of L.L. Legters, the field secretary of the Pioneer Mission Agency and a trusted friend. At a prayer meeting in August 1933 ‚Äú‚Äòthe Lord revealed his will for‚Ä¶ Mr. WC Townsend of Guatemala to make a trip to Mexico City for the purpose of meeting with the government to get permission for sending men into the Indian tribes to learn the languages and to translate the Bible into those Indian tongues.‚Äô‚Äù Just two months later, a letter from S√°enz arrived urging the two men, Townsend and Legters, to visit Mexico. Mexico and the founding of SIL =The initial visit= The winning faction of the Mexican Revolution created the Constitution of 1917, which extended the anticlerical measures of the liberal Constitution of 1857 restricting the Catholic Church in Mexico. Townsend and Legters, however, entered Mexico without missionary credentials. Having cut all formal organizational ties, including those to the Central American Mission, the two men used S√°enz‚Äôs letter of invitation to cross the border and make their way to Mexico City. This instance represents the first of what later critical authorshttp://www.wayoflife.org/database/wycliffe_bible_translators_warning.php would view as ‚Äòdeceits,‚Äô whereby the two men concealed their deeper goal behind a veil of government sanctity. In reality, the letter was the only basis they had to enter Mexico, and it had to be on a personal level, since SIL did not yet exist as an institution. There was no deceit, because S√°enz knew why Townsend wanted to come to Mexico. In this case, the goal of the anti-clerical 1917 Mexican constitution was to reduce the power of the Catholic Church in Mexico. By coming as lay people, without sacrificing or hiding their Christian beliefs, Townsend and Legters, in fact, acted in accordance with the law and its intent. The second key to success in Mexico was Townsend's understanding of the importance of personal connections. His humility, warmth, keen willingness to serve others and also to ask others for help, opened doors to many important figures. During the first trip Townsend and Legters made contact with some friendly Americans and also Mexican officials in venues ranging from dinner parties to embassy lounges and while touring rural schools. Key among these was Rafael Ram√≠rez, director of rural education in the Ministry of Public Education (SEP). Some critics have claimed that, cautious of rejection, Townsend only indirectly and subtly referenced the subjects of religion and Bible translation in his conversations, and thus left the officials enough room for plausible deniability. It is true that in legal documents signed between SIL and governments the translation of the Bible was sometimes officially stated somewhat indirectly as \\"...the translation of literary works of high moral value\\", but Townsend and others inside the Bible translation movement state that the officials signing the documents always knew exactly what that meant, so there was no deceit involved. Townsend always claimed that SIL was an academic institution that applied original linguistic research to the solution of human problems and to the creation of an indigenous literature that included both the collection and publication in written form of previously oral histories and stories and the translation of \\"works of high moral value\\", especially the Bible, but also often including the sections of national constitutions most relevant to indigenous rights, and later the translation of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He explained that, although SIL was not a religious institution per se, its members were lay Christians motivated by their faith to serve the minority language groups of the world. He was also far from circumspect in relating to secular dignitaries, often inviting them to read a passage from the Bible before sharing a meal. As just one example, after being invited to Chapultepec Castle by Mexican President L√°zaro C√°rdenas for a dinner to honor him and his newly arrived linguists, Townsend reported saying to the president: \\"I told him that our young people believed the Bible from cover to cover. They lived according to its teachings, which revealed to them God's love in sending His own Son to serve the needy and to save the lost. Our young people want to follow His example as well as they can by serving the Indians in practical ways, lending whatever assistance to the Mexican government they may and also translating that wonderful revelation of God to humanity into the Indian languages.\\" It is difficult to see indirectness, subtlety or \\"plausible deniability\\" in that explanation of intention, given to the highest governmental authority in Mexico. The fact that the non-sectarian SIL linguists cooperated with Catholics, Protestants and secularists alike, did not found churches themselves, did not occupy leadership positions in indigenous churches or perform any clerical functions, such as baptisms, marriages or funerals made categorizing them difficult. Even within SIL there was some debate as to whether they should define themselves as true \\"missionaries\\" or not. They were certainly not traditional sectarian missionaries, yet their vision included, among many other humanitarian goals, that of providing minority language communities with access to the Bible, and then trusting that the Christian Scriptures would bring about positive spiritual as well as material transformations in individuals and societies, a missionary-like goal. A third and final key to the organization's success in Mexico was the congruence of Townsend's philosophy and proposed plan with a body of intellectual thought that had already begun to circulate in the Mexican intelligentsia, called indigenismo. Many Mexican intellectuals had begun to believe in the gradual incorporation of indigenous cultures into the national society while still preserving those original cultures by applying the principles of cultural anthropology and linguistics. Advances in these fields of study would lead to more effective and respectful systems of cultural and linguistic integration (particularly through the use of bilingual education rather than the imposition of Spanish on minority language speakers at the elementary school level). The goals included the eventual incorporation of indigenous cultures within the national one, while still preserving cultural diversity. The great similarity between indigenismo and Townsend's philosophy of ministry was demonstrated by an extremely significant encounter in the plaza of the small Mexican village of Tetelcingo. On January 21, 1936, President L√°zaro C√°rdenas, known for his extensive visitations to the countryside, paid a visit to a small town just south of Mexico City where Townsend had set up a project. We don't know all the reasons for this visit, and for the resulting friendship between the two men. Both men shared a singular concern for the well-being of the indigenous people of Mexico. Townsend's program, which combined ‚Äúlinguistic research, practical help, and spiritual guidance‚Äù perhaps meshed well with C√°rdenas‚Äô general preoccupation with educating indigenous people. Regardless of the possible reasons for the visit, the result was a deep and lasting friendship (C√°rdenas was the best-man at Townsend's wedding) and a ringing written endorsement of Townsend's work from Mexico's revered President. The events of the previous twenty years of Townsend's life came to fruition at that meeting, which solidified the welcome his linguists received in Mexico for many years to come. Townsend and Legters had opened Camp Wycliffe in Arkansas in the summer of 1934. Named for John Wycliffe, who was responsible for the first complete English translation of the Bible, the camp was designed to train young people in basic linguistics and translation methods. That first year only two students enrolled. The following year, after a training session with five men in attendance (including Kenneth Pike who would become a lifelong friend and prominent academic linguist), Townsend took his students to Mexico to begin field work. Despite the warm welcome afforded the translators in Mexico, Townsend still dreamed of expanding the work into the Amazon and beyond. From this small beginning has grown the worldwide ministry of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now called simply SIL International), Wycliffe Bible Translators (WBT), and the technical and logistics partner of SIL known as JAARS. Peru Kenneth Pike was the first SIL representative to visit Peru in late 1943. SIL signed a contract with the Peruvian Ministry of Education on June 28, 1945. Colby and Dennet, in a book based heavily on imaginative speculation and their own ideological assumptions, claim that in Peru and later expansions, Townsend ‚Äúfound [his] mission tailor-made to the needs of U.S. policymakers‚Ä¶American missionaries had always accompanied American businesses abroad, but the political climate in postwar Latin America gave Townsend‚Äôs new crop of missionary translators and educators a special appeal to U.S. ambassadors who were charged with securing markets and resources for the American economy.‚Äù However, as far as anyone has been able to discover, Townsend did not think at all in the way described by Colby and Dennet. His consuming focus was on serving God and minority language groups by means of education, applied linguistics and Bible translation. His interest in economics grew out of that and was directed almost exclusively at the local and regional levels. In Peru, he hoped that literacy, general education and technical training combined with the moral and ethical values taught in the Bible would help free minority language speakers from their dependence on outside middlemen, especially the jungle \\"patrones\\" who exploited the labor and land resources of the Amazonian peoples. His main excursion into the international economic arena was to write a short book (80 pages) in English explaining the abuses of international oil companies in Mexico and defending the Cardenas government's nationalization of them, the exact opposite political stance from the one Colby and Dennet attribute to Townsend's thought and work. (See W.C. Townsend, The Truth about Mexico's Oil, 1940, SIL). Also counter to their claims, as far as we can discover, Townsend never coordinated anything with Nelson Rockefeller, and probably did not even know him. =The Jungle Aviation and Radio Service (JAARS)= C/STOL utility aircraft designed in 1949; in a JAARS‚Äô hangar in 2005 By 1948 Townsend created the third important corporation tied to SIL: the Jungle Aviation and Radio Service. Until this point operations were held together shakily only by a jeep and several two-way radios provided by the U.S. Embassy. A U.S. Army Air Corp Mission pilot, Larry Montgomery, contacted Townsend in 1946, informing him that a Grumman Duck, a navy amphibious plane, was on sale as Army surplus for a cheap price. The plane proved its worth and even served as the sole rescue transport for a crashed Peruvian military plane in 1947, but also required a hefty additional investment to achieve all the potential that Townsend envisioned. Furthermore, a small fleet of planes would also require a hangar, runway, mechanics, more pilots, fuel, and parts. The missing piece was funding. Townsend sought money successfully by soliciting several wealthy evangelicals including the son and heir of Quaker Oats founder Henry P. Crowell. The project also received many smaller gifts from civic organizations, churches and individuals, and thus JAARS was born. Adapting management Townsend remained active in SIL as the founder and organizational leader for many years. As he aged, his active influence gradually declined, however, under the influence of two general trends: First, the number of SIL members with graduate degrees in linguistics and anthropology steadily increased, with an accompanying rise in the overall academic levels of SIL linguists. Townsend was too busy leading a growing Bible translation movement to pursue graduate training himself, but he never forgot that SIL's translation goals necessitated in-depth scientific understanding of the languages that SIL linguists studied, and thus he endeavored to create truly competent field linguists with trustworthy academic credentials. During SIL's early years, linguistic theory and practice were still in the early stages of development, which made effective analysis of unwritten languages, especially tonal languages, more difficult. The rapid expansion of SIL, which required the training of large numbers of recruits, was also a great challenge to the organization. Fortunately, very early in its history, SIL was greatly helped by two gifted linguists, Kenneth Pike and Eugene Nida. They made significant contributions in the fields of linguistics, translation theory and even anthropology. Most importantly for SIL, they trained many generations of young SIL linguists, first at the University of Oklahoma and later at many other universities around the world. Nida was involved with SIL from its official founding in 1942, first attending and then teaching at Oklahoma each summer until 1953. Pike was involved even earlier and continued to train SIL linguists much longer, even during the time he was Chairman of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Michigan. He and many other SIL PhDs and MAs pursued the in-depth study of language and culture for its own sake, as well as for its usefulness in Bible translation. They, like Townsend, viewed language as one of God's greatest gifts to human beings. Hundreds of MAs and dozens of PhDs filled the upper tiers of SIL's academic hierarchy, and gradually influenced more and more the operations of the organization. Second, a controversy, composed of two separate but related components, engulfed SIL between approximately 1971 and 1981. Firstly, according to Stoll, critics in the U.S., particularly in the halls of academia, left few facets of the Institute's work unscathed. Some even criticized the bringing of literacy to preliterate societies as harmful. However, the biggest negative reaction to SIL was probably triggered by opposition to its translation of the Bible. How could an academic organization justify translating a religious book for often preliterate people groups who had their own traditional religions? SIL's response was that it was just making the Bible accessible to anyone who might want to read it. Secondly, during the same period many foreign governments were criticized by politically motivated factions for cooperating so closely with SIL. Their criticisms of SIL ranged from the unfair and the unsubstantiated (like the claim that SIL was seeking raw materials for U.S. corporations) to the ridiculous (that it had killed indigenous babies to render their fat, so that it could be used as an ingredient in rocket fuel, explaining how the Americans had been able to land on the moon). The campaign was part of the Cold War struggle between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, with SIL viewed as a symbol of the U.S. However, the charges caused governments to argue internally over whether to continue supporting SIL with state contracts and, in at least one case, whether to allow the SIL presence to continue within its borders. Ecuador, for example, chose to end its official ties with SIL. In Peru, the government, after an in-depth investigation of SIL, not only rescinded an order it had given for SIL to leave the country, but actually renewed and expanded its original contract for 10 additional years. In 1981, Peru's president, Fernando Belaunde Terry, gave William Cameron Townsend the highest award that a foreigner can receive from Peru, the most advanced level of the Order of the Sun (El Orden del Sol), in honor of his and SIL's service on behalf of Peru's minority language groups. It was an affirming conclusion that came near the end of the life of an itinerant Bible salesman who lived to become the friend of presidents, and the main catalyst for the largest Bible translation movement in history. He continued to serve as an advisor to SIL leaders and others until his death one year later, at age 85.

The objects to be moved are tilted forward, the ledge is inserted underneath them, and the objects allowed to tilt back and rest on the ledge. The truck and objects are then tilted backward until the weight is balanced over the wheels, making otherwise bulky and heavy objects easier to move. It is a first-class lever. Overview Sack trucks were originally used in the 18th century to move large sacks of spices on docks by young boys, from the age of 11, who were unable to lift the large sacks by hand. By using this method they were able to work as well as grown men in moving items around. Later, such trucks were amended for use in many different industries, such as brewing, where hops were moved in sacks. Some hand trucks are equipped with stairclimber wheels, which, as the name implies, are designed to go up and down stairs. These stair climbing hand trucks have three wheels on each side that are always in contact with stairs for added stability. Stairclimber wheels can sometimes be problematic when trying to turn on flat ground as four wheels in a fixed position will be in contact with the ground. Hand trucks are fabricated from many different types of materials, including steel tube, aluminum tube, aluminum extrusion and high impact plastics. Most commercial hand trucks used for beverage and food service deliveries are rugged and very light. They are usually constructed from two extruded aluminum channel side rails and cast aluminum or magnesium parts. Example of hand truck stair climber wheels. UpCart pictured. Some of the options that may be considered are the types of wheels, stair climber, handle type and size of wheels. Other things to be considered should be the load shape compared with the backrest shape, e.g., cylindrical loads should sit on curved backrests, and the environmental conditions in which the hand truck will operate. For example, on loose or uneven ground oversize wheels are a great advantage; solid or puncture-proof foam filled tires may be used where punctures could deflate pneumatic tires. A rule of thumb is that the toe or nose of the truck should be at least one-third of the length of the load. Hand trucks are sometimes used as baggage carts by porters in train stations and skycaps at airports. A piano tilter is a type of hand truck for moving an upright piano without damaging it. Unlike a traditional dolly, which pivots around a smaller wheel or point, the piano tilter has large curved sections to gently tilt an upright piano until it is lying flat on its back.

Life and career Born in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Langdon began working in medicine shows and stock companies while in his teens. In 1906, he entered vaudeville with his first wife, Rose Langdon. By 1915, he had developed a sketch named \\"Johnny's New Car,\\" on which he performed variations in the years that followed. In 1923, he joined Principal Pictures Corporation, a company headed by producer Sol Lesser. He eventually went to The Mack Sennett Studios, where he became a major star.Harter, Chuck and Michael J. Hayde; Little Elf: A Celebration of Harry Langdon (BearManor Media, 2012). At the height of his film career, he was considered one of the four best comics of the silent film era. His screen character was that of a wide-eyed, childlike man with an innocent's understanding of the world and the people in it. He was a first- class pantomimist. 1927 Harper's Bazaar ad for Long Pants Most of Langdon's 1920s work was produced at the famous Mack Sennett studio. His screen character was unique and his antics so different from the broad Sennett slapstick that he soon had a following. Success led him into feature films, directed by Arthur Ripley and Frank Capra. With such directors guiding him, Langdon's work rivaled that of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton. Many consider his best films to be The Strong Man (1926), Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926), and Long Pants (1927). Langdon acted as producer on these features, which were made for his own company, The Harry Langdon Corporation, and released by First National. After his initial success, he fired Frank Capra and directed his own films, including Three's a Crowd, The Chaser, and Heart Trouble, but his appeal faded. These films were more personal and idiosyncratic, and audiences of the period were not interested. Capra later claimed that Langdon's decline stemmed from the fact that, unlike the other great silent comics, he never fully understood what made his own film character successful. However, Langdon's biographer Bill Schelly, among others, have expressed skepticism about this claim, arguing that Langdon had established his character in vaudeville long before he entered movies, added by the fact that he wrote most of his own material during his stage years. History shows that Langdon's greatest success was while being directed by Capra, and once he took hold of his own destiny, his original film comedy persona dropped sharply in popularity with audiences. This is likely not due to Langdon's material, which he had always written himself, but due to his inexperience with the many fine points of directing, at which Capra excelled, but at which Langdon was a novice. On the other hand, a look at Langdon's filmography shows that Capra directed only two of Langdon's 30 silent comedies. His last silent film, and the last one Langdon directed, Heart Trouble, is a \\"lost film\\", so it is difficult to assess whether he might have begun achieving a greater understanding of the directorial process with more experience. The coming of sound, and the drastic changes in cinema, also thwarted Langdon's chances of evolving as a director and perhaps defining a style that might have enjoyed greater box office success. Langdon's babyish character did not adapt well to sound films; as producer Hal Roach remarked, \\"He was not so funny articulate\\" (he featured Langdon in several unsuccessful sound shorts in 1929‚Äì1930). But Langdon was a big enough name to command leads in short subjects for Educational Pictures and Columbia Pictures. In 1938, he adopted a Caspar Milquetoast-type, henpecked-husband character that served him well. Langdon continued to work steadily in low-budget features and shorts into the 1940s, playing mild-mannered goofs. He also contributed to comedy scripts as a writer, notably for Laurel and Hardy, which led to him being paired with Oliver Hardy in a 1939 film titled Zenobia during a period when Stan Laurel was in a bitter contract dispute with Roach. Langdon was considered to be the live-action role model for Dopey in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but Walt Disney rejected the idea. Eddie Collins played the role instead. Death Harry Langdon kept busy in pictures and completed his final Columbia short Pistol Packin' Nitwits only weeks before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on December 22, 1944. All funeral arrangements were handled by onscreen cohort and friend Vernon Dent.Okuda, Ted and Watz, Edward; (1986). The Columbia Comedy Shorts, pp. 115‚Äì123, 221‚Äì222, McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Langdon was cremated and his ashes interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. At the height of his career, Langdon was making $7,500 per week, a fortune for the times. Upon his death, The New York Times wrote, \\"His whole appeal was a consummate ability to look inexpressibly forlorn when confronted with manifold misfortunes‚Äîusually of the domestic type. He was what was known as 'dead-pan'...the feeble smile and owlish blink which had become his stock-in-trade caught on in a big way, and he skyrocketed to fame and fortune...\\"The New York Times, Obituary, December 23, 1944. In 1997, his hometown of Council Bluffs celebrated \\"Harry Langdon Day\\" and in 1999 named Harry Langdon Boulevard in his honor. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Harry Langdon has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard. Langdon is briefly depicted in the biographical film Stan & Ollie, played by Richard Cant, where he is preparing for the shooting of Zenobia with Oliver Hardy.

He was a New Democratic member of the Canadian parliament from 1980 to 1993. He represented the downtown Toronto ridings of Beaches and Beaches-Woodbine. Background Young was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1936. He emigrated to Canada in the 1950s and worked as a machinist in the electrical industry. He later became an organizer for the United Electrical Workers Union. After leaving politics he worked as a consultant on people with disabilities. He and his wife Vivien raised four children. He died on March 7, 2015 in Toronto. Politics He ran unsuccessfully for Toronto City Council's Ward 9 in 1976. He came in 6th place behind winners Pat Sheppard and Tom Wardle Jr. In a closely contested nomination race, he won the NDP nomination for the Beaches federal electoral district by two votes in 1977. In the federal election of 1979 he lost narrowly to Progressive Conservative candidate Robin Richardson by 518 votes. The PC's won and Richardson served in the short lived Joe Clark minority government. In 1980, Young faced Richardson again, this time defeating him by 1,496 votes. He represented the electoral districts of Beaches from 1980 to 1988, and Beaches‚ÄîWoodbine from 1988 to 1993, in the House of Commons of Canada as a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Young served as the NDP critic on several portfolios such as pensions and veteran's affairs. He was the party's whip from 1981 to 1984. He was defeated in the 1993 election by Liberal Party of Canada candidate Maria Minna.

It consists of a light box with small colored plastic pegs that fit into a panel and illuminate to create a lit picture, by either using one of the included templates or creating a \\"freeform\\" image on a blank sheet of black paper. There are eight peg colors: red, blue, orange, white (clear/colorless), green, yellow, pink, and violet (purple). In the event that pegs were lost or damaged, Hasbro provided refills and/or new colors. Color-by-letter templates were sold with the set so that children could create characters including Mickey Mouse, Scooby-Doo, My Little Pony, and Transformers among others. History Lite- Brite was invented by Joseph M. Burck, a senior designer at Chicago toy and game design company Marvin Glass and Associates, which licensed the invention to Hasbro. Lite-Brite was named one of the top 100 toys of all time by Time Magazinehttp://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048656_2049112,00.html and is a Finalist for the Class of 2020 induction to the National Toy Hall of Fame.https://www.museumofplay.org/press/releases/2020/09/6155-meet- the-2020-toy-hall-finalists Description Lite-Brite allows the artist to create a glowing picture by punching multi-colored translucent plastic pegs through opaque black paper. Using a standard light bulb, the light is blocked by the black paper except where the pegs conduct the light. When lit, the pegs have an appearance similar to that of LEDs. Changes Over the years, Lite- Brite was offered in different forms including a flat-screen version, a 3D cube, and an FX edition that spins and plays music. The Lite-Brite LED Flat Screen currently sells at MSRP $10, comes in several colors, is LED lit, and is portable, running on three AA batteries. The Lite-Brite 3D cube (called the Four-Share Cube) is a LED-lit four-sided cube that allowed children to play with friends or save three of their designs. The FX Edition is no longer on Hasbro's website. The website has SUN 'N NITE BRITE Sets priced at $10 MSRP and running on three AAA batteries.

The skirmish took place within Manuel Dominguez's Rancho San Pedro. Background After receiving word of the Siege of Los Angeles, Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent US Navy Captain William Mervine and the Savannah on October 4 to San Pedro to assist Capt. Archibald H. Gillespie. Arriving on October 7, Mervine set out on October 8 with sailors, marines and bear flaggers to recapture the town. (Note: there is confusion about the exact dates of the events, with some sources believing them to be a day earlier.) Battle Mervine's march was poorly planned with little knowledge of the enemy. It began inauspiciously with the death by friendly fire of a cabin boy upon landing. His troops were armed with an assortment of muskets, cutlasses and pikes; they brought no horses, wagons or cannons. The first leg of the planned march toward the pueblo, on October 8, was a six-hour dusty slog with little or no water, during which they were harassed by the enemy on the hillsides around them. Mervine and his troops reached the abandoned Dominguez Rancho, where they camped for the night, within view of an advance detachment of Flores' troops. There was sporadic firing from the enemy during the night, with no other effect than that of depriving Mervine's party of sleep. Setting off at daylight on the 9th, the Americans advanced just to the north of Dominguez Rancho. When the Americans had occupied Los Angeles in August, residents had hidden some weapons by burying them. General Jos√© Flores' force, equipped with lances, knives and old firearms that had been hidden, was nearly as poorly armed, but it did have a cannon. This old brass four-pounder, used ceremonially in the Los Angeles Plaza, had been buried in the garden of Inocencia Reyes. It was dug up and mounted on a horse-drawn limber. (In another account, the \\"old Woman\\" is identified as Clara Cota de Reyes. It is said that she had buried the small cannon in a cane patch near her home with the help of her daughters, one of whom was named Inocencia.) Se√±ora Reyes' four-pounder was placed on the narrow trail that the Americans needed to use. Ropes (probably lassos or riatas) were lashed to the limber to pull the gun into the brush for reloading. The Californio horsemen deployed at a safe distance from the trail on the enemy's flanks. The simple tactics proved effective. When the Americans came within 400 yards, the cannon was fired and quickly pulled back into the brush, followed by musket fire from the horsemen. Mervine's forces were helpless on foot against a mounted enemy they could neither see nor count. Realizing they could not reach Los Angeles, Mervine had little choice except to retreat. The main battle lasted less than an hour; five hours later Mervine's forces were back on their ship in San Pedro Bay. Aftermath Four of the seriously wounded Americans died and were buried on a little island in San Pedro Bay called Isla de los Muertos, along with the cabin boy. (Island of the Dead.). Mervine's troops reboarded the Savannah, and after a few days, the warship sailed north toward Monterey. The fate of the old woman's gun is unclear. Some say it was surrendered to the Americans after the Capitulation of Cahuenga; however, another account tells that the cannon was resurrected by the Californio dons in 1853 for the celebration of the Fourth of July. According to the account of one Major Horace Bell, a Los Angeles Ranger, Juan Sepulveda dug up the gun from near his own property and took it to Dead Man's Island where he and his friends set it up near the graves of the Americans and fired a salute \\"in the exuberance of his patriotism.\\" It is possible that the famous gun was displayed at the New Orleans Exposition of 1884-85 in the Navy Exhibit.

Produced at Warner Brothers, it has music by Max Steiner. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards. Irving Rapper said he did not want to make the film and had to be talked into it by Hal B. Wallis. Plot A group of people are watching Halley's Comet overhead when Judge Clemens is called away for the birth of his son, Samuel Clemens. The film proceeds to mix in elements of many of Clemens' best-known stories as if they actually occurred. Thus, as he grows up, Sam plays with his friends Huck, Tom, and the slave boy Jim on a raft on the Mississippi, providing a fictitious \\"real-life\\" basis for the novels Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The teenage Sam goes to work for his brother Orion, publisher of the Hannibal Journal newspaper, at his now-widowed mother's urging, but after three unhappy years, runs away to become a river boat pilot. After a rough start, he thrives under the tutelage of Captain Horace Bixby and becomes a highly skilled pilot on the Mississippi River. One day, he spots a pickpocket robbing Charles Langdon, a passenger aboard his ship. Among the possessions Sam forces the thief to return is a small portrait of Charles's sister Olivia. After seeing it, Sam falls deeply in love. As they become friends, Sam tells Charles that he is going to marry Olivia. To that end, he gives up his job to seek his fortune with his friend Steve, prospecting for gold or silver (with little success) in the west. When he finally gives up, he becomes a newspaper reporter in Nevada. Steve persuades him to enter a jumping frog contest against Bret Harte. The plot is taken from Twain's real first major story, \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\". Steve cheats by secretly feeding lead buckshot to Harte's champion frog. Their frog wins easily as a result. However, Sam later sheepishly admits to Steve that he bet all their money on the champ. Sam then writes the story and sends it off, under the pen name Mark Twain, to try to get it published. When the Civil War begins, Sam leaves Nevada, narrowly missing J. B. Pond, who has come all the way from the east to find the writer of the frog story. (In real life, Clemens went to Nevada after the war started, partly to get away from the conflict.) The \\"Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is published in the newspapers and is widely read and greatly enjoyed as a welcome change from the grim war news. (In real life, the frog story was not published until the war was already over.) When the Civil War ends, Pond finally finds Sam. He signs him up for a lecture tour. Charles and Olivia (\\"Livy\\") Langdon are in the audience of his very first lecture, where his humor and wit make him an immediate success. He marries his beloved Livy, despite her father's initial opposition, and becomes a famous writer and lecturer. However, Sam wants to become more than just a humorist. He invests in a typesetting machine and establishes a publishing company. Both ventures require more and more capital, so Sam has to keep writing furiously for years. Finally fed up with his constant money troubles, he turns to businessman Henry Huttleston Rogers to extricate him from his financial mess. Rogers tells him he can avoid bankruptcy, but only if he does not honor his overly-generous contract to publish Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs. Sam agrees to go see the former president. Dismayed to find Grant poverty- stricken and dying, he decides that the country owes the great man such a debt of gratitude that going bankrupt is a small price to pay. (In reality, the company did publish Grant's memoirs‚Äîabout eight years before Clemens met Rogers‚Äîand the venture was a huge success. The business did, in fact, eventually go bankrupt, but not because of Grant.) Though Rogers gets the creditors to accept half payment, Sam is determined to pay in full his staggering debt of $250,000. To do so, he embarks on a strenuous worldwide lecture tour, leaving behind Livy to care for their daughters. At last, he manages to pay everything off and is reunited with his now-ailing wife in Florence. She is very proud when she receives word just before she dies that her husband is to receive an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, which she considers the greatest honor a writer can attain. Sam himself dies when Halley's Comet returns in 1910. Afterward, his spirit is called away by Tom and Huck to join them in the afterlife. Before walking away, Sam's spirit tells his grieving daughter (who of course cannot see him) that the rumors of his demise are greatly exaggerated.

Bosley Crowther gave a generally negative review in The New York Times, calling it a \\"lengthy and desultory picture\\" and \\"a spotty and often inaccurate chronicle\\", and complaining \\"This spotty character of the picture is due not alone to the script but also to the direction, which is strangely inconsistent throughout.\\" He continued by saying \\"Mr. March's performance of Twain is agreeable,\\" but called Alexis Smith's portrayal \\"colorless and conventional\\". Variety ran a positive review, calling it \\"an educational yet highly entertaining biography of the immortal American ... The stars, notably, perform their assignments with extraordinary compassion and understanding, particularly March in the title role.\\" Harrison's Reports was also positive, calling it \\"an excellently produced, heart-warming human- interest drama, well acted and directed. Fredric March portrays Twain with deep understanding.\\" David Lardner of The New Yorker dismissed the film, writing that it wasn't much worse than most biographical films and \\"does have its good moments\\", but \\"once more biographical inaccuracy is rampant, and once more the best dramatic possibilities have been overlooked.\\" The Adventures of Mark Twain has been called \\"perhaps the most impressive of all Forties large- scale biopics\\" by Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg in their book Hollywood in the Forties.

Overview  IP Pascal implements the language \\"Pascaline\\" (named after Blaise Pascal's calculator), which is a highly extended superset of ISO 7185 Pascal. It adds modularity with namespace control, including the parallel tasking monitor concept, dynamic arrays, overloads and overrides, objects, and a host of other minor extensions to the language. IP implements a porting platform, including a widget toolkit, TCP/IP library, MIDI and sound library and other functions, that allows both programs written under IP Pascal, and IP Pascal itself, to move to multiple operating systems and machines. IP Pascal is one of the only Pascal implementations that still exist that has passed the Pascal Validation Suite, a large suite of tests created to verify compliance with ISO 7185 Pascal. Although Pascaline extends ISO 7185 Pascal, it does not reduce the type safety of Pascal (as many other dialects of Pascal have by including so called \\"type escapes\\"). The functionality of the language is similar to that of C# (which implements a C++ like language but with the type insecurities removed), and Pascaline can be used anywhere that managed programs can be used (even though it is based on a language 30 years older than C#).  Open or closed status  The author of Pascaline the language has stated that there is no wish to have it remain as a proprietary language. IP Pascal is sold as an implementation of Pascaline, but the language itself can and should be open, and should have quality implementations. To that end, the full specification for Pascaline will be published online, and the long-term intention is to create a version of the open source P5 compiler-interpreter (an ISO 7185 version of Wirth's P4 compiler-interpreter) which implements Pascaline compliance. This will be known as the P6 compiler, and it will also be openly published and distributed. The value of IP Pascal as a commercial product will be based on the IDE and compiler-encoder resources of that system. This article follows a fairly old version of Pascaline. A newer version of Pascaline exists as Pascal-P6, part of the Pascal-P series. See the references below.  Language  IP Pascal starts with ISO 7185 Pascal (which standardized Niklaus Wirth's original language), and adds: = modules, including parallel task constructs process, monitor and share = module mymod(input, output); uses extlib; const one = 1; type string = packed array of char; procedure wrtstr(view s: string); private var s: string; procedure wrtstr(view s: string); var i: integer; begin for i := 1 to max(s) do write(s[i]) end; begin { initialize monitor } end; begin { shutdown monitor } end. Modules have entry and exit sections. Declarations in modules form their own interface specifications, and it is not necessary to have both interface and implementation sections. If a separate interface declaration file is needed, it is created by stripping the code out of a module and creating a \\"skeleton\\" of the module. This is typically done only if the object for a module is to be sent out without the source. Modules must occupy a single file, and modules reference other modules via a uses or joins statement. To allow this, a module must bear the same name as its file name. The uses statement indicates that the referenced module will have its global declarations merged with the referencing module, and any name conflicts that result will cause an error. The joins statement will cause the referenced module to be accessible via the referencing module, but does not merge the name spaces of the two modules. Instead, the referencing module must use a so- called \\"qualified identifier\\": module.identifier A program from ISO 7185 Pascal is directly analogous to a module, and is effectively a module without an exit section. Because all modules in the system are \\"daisy chained\\" such that each are executed in order, a program assumes \\"command\\" of the program simply because it does not exit its initialization until its full function is complete, unlike a module which does. In fact, it is possible to have multiple program sections, which would execute in sequence. A process module, like a program module, has only an initialization section, and runs its start, full function and completion in that section. However, it gets its own thread for execution aside from the main thread that runs program modules. As such, it can only call monitor and share modules. A monitor is a module that includes task locking on each call to an externally accessible procedure or function, and implements communication between tasks by semaphores. A share module, because it has no global data at all, can be used by any other module in the system, and is used to place library code in. Because the module system directly implements multitasking/multithreading using the Monitor concept, it solves the majority of multithreading access problems. Data for a module is bound to the code with mutexes or Mutually Exclusive Sections. Subtasks/subthreads are started transparently with the process module. Multiple subtasks/subthreads can access monitors or share modules. A share module is a module without data, which does not need the locking mechanisms of a monitor. = Dynamic arrays = In IP Pascal, dynamics are considered \\"containers\\" for static arrays. The result is that IP Pascal is perhaps the only Pascal where dynamic arrays are fully compatible with the ISO 7185 static arrays from the original language. A static array can be passed into a dynamic array parameter to a procedure or function, or created with new program test(output); type string = packed array of char; var s: string; procedure wrtstr(view s: string); var i: integer; begin for i := 1 to max(s) do write(s[i]) end; begin new(s, 12); s := 'Hello, world'; wrtstr(s^); wrtstr('That's all folks') end. Such \\"container\\" arrays can be any number of dimensions. = Constant expressions = A constant declaration can contain expressions of other constants const b = a+10; = Radix for numbers = $ff, &76, %011000 = Alphanumeric goto labels = label exit; goto exit; = underscore in all labels = var my_number: integer; = underscore in numbers = a := 1234_5678; The '_' (break) character can be included anywhere in a number except for the first digit. It is ignored, and serves only to separate digits in the number. = Special character sequences that can be embedded in constant strings = const str = 'the rain in Spain\\\\cr\\\\lf'; Using standard ISO 8859-1 mnemonics. = Duplication of forwarded headers = procedure x(i: integer); forward; ... procedure x(i: integer); begin ... end; This makes it easier to declare a forward by cut-and-paste, and keeps the parameters of the procedure or function in the actual header where they can be seen. = halt procedure = procedure error(view s: string); begin writeln('*** Error: ', s:0); halt { terminate program } end; = Special predefined header files = program myprog(input, output, list); begin writeln(list, 'Start of listing:'); ... program echo(output, command); var c: char; begin while not eoln(command) do begin read(command, c); write(c) end; writeln end. program newprog(input, output, error); begin ... writeln(error, 'Bad parameter'); halt ... 'command' is a file that connects to the command line, so that it can be read using normal file read operations. = Automatic connection of program header files to command line names = program copy(source, destination); var source, destination: text; c: char; begin reset(source); rewrite(destination); while not eof(source) do begin while not eoln(source) do begin read(source, c); write(destination, c) end; readln(source); writeln(destination) end end. 'source' and 'destination' files are automatically connected to the parameters on the command line for the program. = File naming and handling operations = program extfile(output); var f: file of integer; begin assign(f, 'myfile'); { set name of external file } update(f); { keep existing file, and set to write mode } position(f, length(f)); { position to end of file to append to it } writeln('The end of the file is: ', location(f)); { tell user location of new element } write(f, 54321); { write new last element } close(f) { close the file } end. = fixed declarations which declare structured constant types = fixed table: array [1..5] of record a: integer; packed array [1..10] of char end = array record 1, 'data1 ' end, record 2, 'data2 ' end, record 3, 'data3 ' end, record 4, 'data4 ' end, record 5, 'data5 ' end end; = Boolean bit operators = program test; var a, b: integer; begin a := a and b; b := b or $a5; a := not b; b := a xor b end. = Extended range variables = program test; var a: linteger; b: cardinal; c: lcardinal; d: 1..maxint*2; ... Extended range specifications give rules for scalars that lie outside the range of -maxint..maxint. It is implementation-specific as to just how large a number is possible, but Pascaline defines a series of standard types that exploit the extended ranges, including linteger for double-range integers, cardinal for unsigned integers, and lcardinal for unsigned double range integers. Pascaline also defines new limits for these types, as maxlint, maxcrd, and maxlcrd. = Semaphores = monitor test; var notempty, notfull: semaphore; procedure enterqueue; begin while nodata do wait(notempty); ... signalone(notfull) end; ... begin end. Semaphores implement task event queuing directly in the language, using the classical methods outlined by Per Brinch Hansen. = Overrides = module test1; virtual procedure x; begin ... end; program test; joins test1; override procedure x; begin inherited x end; begin end. Overriding a procedure or function in another module effectively \\"hooks\\" that routine, replacing the definition for all callers of it, but makes the original definition available to the hooking module. This allows the overriding module to add new functionality to the old procedure or function. This can be implemented to any depth. = Overloads = procedure x; begin end; overload procedure x(i: integer); begin end; overload function x: integer; begin x := 1 end; Overload \\"groups\\" allow a series of procedures and/or functions to be placed under the same name and accessed by their formal parameter or usage \\"signature\\". Unlike other languages that implement the concept, Pascaline will not accept overloads as belonging to the same group unless they are not ambiguous with each other. This means that there is no \\"priority\\" of overloads, nor any question as to which routine of an overload group will be executed for any given actual reference. = Objects = program test; uses baseclass; class alpha; extends beta; type alpha_ref = reference to alpha; var a, b: integer; next: alpha_ref; virtual procedure x(d: integer); begin a := d; self := next end; private var q: integer; begin end. var r: alpha_ref; begin new(r); ... if r is alpha then r.a := 1; r.x(5); ... end. In Pascaline, classes are a dynamic instance of a module (and modules are a static instance of a class). Classes are a code construct (not a type) that exists between modules and procedures and functions. Because a class is a module, it can define any code construct, such as constants, types, variables, fixed, procedures and functions (which become \\"methods\\"), and make them public to clients of the class, or hide them with the \\"private\\" keyword. Since a class is a module, it can be accessed via a qualified identifier. Classes as modules have automatic access to their namespace as found in C# and C++ in that they do not require any qualification. Outside of the class, all members of the class can be accessed either by qualified identifier or by a reference. A reference is a pointer to the object that is created according to the class. Any number of instances of a class, known as \\"objects\\" can be created with the new() statement, and removed with the dispose() statement. Class members that have instance data associated with them, such as variables (or fields) and methods must be accessed via a reference. A reference is a type, and resembles a pointer, including the ability to have the value nil, and checking for equality with other reference types. It is not required to qualify the pointer access with \\"^\\". Pascaline implements the concept of \\"reference grace\\" to allow a reference to access any part of the object regardless of whether or not it is per-instance. This characteristic allows class members to be \\"promoted\\", that is moved from constants to variables, and then to \\"properties\\" (which are class fields whose read and write access are provided by \\"get\\" and \\"set\\" methods). Both overloads and overrides are provided for and object's methods. A method that will be overridden must be indicated as virtual. Object methods can change the reference used to access them with the \`self\` keyword. Single inheritance only is implemented. = Structured exception handling = try ... except ... else ...; throw The \\"try\\" statement can guard a series of statements, and any exceptions flagged within the code are routined to the statement after \\"except\\". The try statement also features an else clause that allows a statement to be executed on normal termination of the try block. Exceptions are raised in the code via the throw() procedure. Try statements allow the program to bail out of any nested block, and serve as a better replacement for intra-procedure gotos (which are still supported under Pascaline). Since unhandled exceptions generate errors by default, the throw() procedure can serve as a general purpose error flagging system. = Assertions = assert(expression); The system procedure assert causes the program to terminate if the value tested is false. It is typically coupled to a runtime dump or diagnostic, and can be removed by compiler option. = Unicode = IP Pascal can generate either ISO 8859-1 mode programs (8-bit characters) or Unicode mode programs by a simple switch at compile time (unlike many other languages, there is no source difference between Unicode and non-Unicode programs). The ASCII upward-compatible UTF-8 format is used in text files, and these files are read to and from 8- or 16-bit characters internal to the program (the upper 128 characters of ISO 8859-1 are converted to and from UTF-8 format in text files even in an 8-bit character encoded program). = Constant for character high limit = Similar to maxint, Pascaline has a maxchr, which is the maximum character that exists in the character set (and may not in fact have a graphical representation). The range of the type char is then defined as 0..maxchr. This is an important addition for dealing with types like \\"set of char\\", and aids when dealing with different character set options (such as ISO 8859-1 or Unicode).  Modular structure  IP Pascal uses a unique stacking concept for modules. Each module is stacked one atop the other in memory, and executed at the bottom. The bottom module calls the next module up, and that module calls the next module, and so on. wrapper serlib program cap The cap module (sometimes called a \\"cell\\" in IP Pascal terminology, after a concept in integrated circuit design) terminates the stack, and begins a return process that ripples back down until the program terminates. Each module has its startup or entry section performed on the way up the stack, and its finalization or exit section performed on the way back down. This matches the natural dependencies in a program. The most primitive modules, such as the basic I/O support in \\"serlib\\", perform their initialization first, and their finalization last, before and after the higher level modules in the stack.  Porting platform  IP Pascal has a series of modules (or \\"libraries\\") that form a \\"porting platform\\". These libraries present an idealized API for each function that applies, such as files and extended operating system functions, graphics, midi and sound, etc. The whole collection forms the basis for an implementation on each operating system and machine that IP Pascal appears on. The two important differences between IP Pascal and many other languages that have simply been mated with portable graphics libraries are that: # IP Pascal uses its own porting platform for its own low level code, so that once the platform is created for a particular operating system and machine, both the IP system and the programs it compiles can run on that. This is similar to the way Java and the UCSD Pascal systems work, but with true high optimization compiled code, not interpreted code or \\"just in time\\" compiled code. # Since modules can override lower level functions such as Pascal's \\"write\\" statement, normal, unmodified ISO 7185 Pascal programs can also use advanced aspects of the porting platform. This is unlike many or most portable graphics libraries that force the user to use a completely different I/O methodology to access a windowed graphics system, for example C, other Pascals, and Visual Basic. IP modules can also be created that are system independent, and rely only on the porting platform modules. The result is that IP Pascal is very highly portable. Example: The standard \\"hello world\\" program is coupled to output into a graphical window. program HelloWorld(output); begin writeln('Hello, World!') end. Example: \\"hello world\\" with graphical commands added. Note that standard Pascal output statements are still used. program hello(input, output); uses gralib; var er: evtrec; begin bcolor(output, green); curvis(output, false); auto(output, false); page(output); fcolor(output, red); frect(output, 50, 50, maxxg(output)-50, maxyg(output)-50); fcolorg(output, maxint, maxint-(maxint div 3), maxint-maxint div 3); frect(output, 50, 50, 53, maxyg(output)-50); frect(output, 50, 50, maxxg(output)-50, 53); fcolorg(output, maxint div 2, 0, 0); frect(output, 52, maxyg(output)-53, maxxg(output)-50, maxyg(output)-50); frect(output, maxxg(output)-53, 52, maxxg(output)-50, maxyg(output)-50); font(output, font_sign); fontsiz(output, 100); binvis(output); fcolor(output, cyan); cursorg(output, maxxg(output) div 2-strsiz(output, 'hello, world') div 2+3, maxyg(output) div 2-100 div 2+3); writeln('hello, world'); fcolor(output, blue); cursorg(output, maxxg(output) div 2-strsiz(output, 'hello, world') div 2, maxyg(output) div 2-100 div 2); writeln('hello, world'); repeat event(input, er) until er.etype = etterm end. Example: Breakout game. Example: Graphical clock in a sizable window. Because IP Pascal modules can \\"override\\" each other, a graphical extension module (or any other type of module) can override the standard I/O calls implemented in a module below it. Thus, paslib implements standard Pascal statements such as read, write, and other support services. gralib overrides these services and redirects all standard Pascal I/O to graphical windows. The difference between this and such libraries in other implementations is that you typically have to stop using the standard I/O statements and switch to a completely different set of calls and paradigms. This means that you cannot \\"bring forward\\" programs implemented with the serial I/O paradigm to graphical systems. Another important difference with IP Pascal is that it uses procedural language methods to access the Windowed graphics library. Most graphics toolkits force the use of object-oriented programming methods to the toolkit. One reason for this is because Object orientation is a good match for graphics, but it also occurs because common systems such as Windows force the application program to appear as a service program to the operating system, appearing as a collection of functions called by the operating system, instead of having the program control its own execution and call the operating system. This is commonly known as callback design. Object-oriented code often works better with callbacks because it permits an object's methods to be called as callbacks, instead of a programmer having to register several pointers to functions to event handling code, each of which would be an individual callback. Object- orientation is a good programming method, but IP Pascal makes it an optional, not a required, methodology to write programs. IP Pascal's ability to use procedural methods to access all graphics functions means that there is no \\"cliff effect\\" for older programs. They don't need to be rewritten just to take advantage of modern programming environments. Another interesting feature of the IP porting platform is that it supports a character mode, even in graphical environments, by providing a \\"character grid\\" that overlays the pixel grid, and programs that use only character mode calls (that would work on any terminal or telnet connection) work under graphical environments automatically.  History  = The Z80 implementation = The compiler started out in 1980 on Micropolis Disk Operating System, but was moved rapidly to CP/M running on the Z80. The original system was coded in Z80 assembly language, and output direct machine code for the Z80. It was a single-pass compiler without a linker, it included its system support library within the compiler, and relocated and output that into the generated code into the runnable disk file. After the compiler was operational, almost exactly at the new year of 1980, a companion assembler for the compiler was written, in Pascal, followed by a linker, in Z80 assembly language. This odd combination was due to a calculation that showed the linker tables would be a problem in the 64kb limited Z80, so the linker needed to be as small as possible. This was then used to move the compiler and linker Z80 source code off the Micropolis assembler (which was a linkerless assembler that created a single output binary) to the new assembler linker system. After this, the compiler was retooled to output to the linker format, and the support library moved into a separate file and linked in. In 1981, the compiler was extensively redone to add optimization, such as register allocation, boolean to jump, dead code, constant folding, and other optimizations. This created a Pascal implementation that benchmarked better than any existing Z80 compilers, as well as most 8086 compilers. Unfortunately, at 46kb, it also was difficult to use, being able to compile only a few pages of source code before overflowing its tables (this was a common problem with most Pascal implementations on small address processors). The system was able to be used primarily because of the decision to create a compact linker allowed for large systems to be constructed from these small object files. Despite this, the original IP Pascal implementation ran until 1987 as a general purpose compiler. In this phase, IP Pascal was C like in its modular layout. Each source file was a unit, and consisted of some combination of a 'program' module, types, constants, variables, procedures or functions. These were in \\"free format\\". Procedures, functions, types, constants and variables could be outside of any block, and in any order. Procedures, functions, and variables in other files were referenced by 'external' declarations, and procedures, functions, and variables in the current file were declared 'global'. Each file was compiled to an object file, and then linked together. There was no type checking across object files. As part of the original compiler, a device independent terminal I/O module was created to allow use of any serial terminal (similar to Turbo Pascal's CRT unit), which remains to this day. In 1985, an effort was begun to rewrite the compiler in Pascal. The new compiler would be two pass with intermediate, which was designed to solve the memory problems associated with the first compiler. The front end of the compiler was created and tested without intermediate code generation capabilities (parse only). in 1987, the Z80 system used for IP was exchanged for an 80386 IBM-PC, and work on it stopped. From that time several other, ISO 7185 standard compilers were used, ending with the SVS Pascal compiler, a 32 bit DPMI extender based implementation. = The 80386 implementation = By 1993, ISO 7185 compatible compilers that delivered high quality 32 bit code were dying off. At this point, the choice was to stop using Pascal, or to revive the former IP Pascal project and modernize it as an 80386 compiler. At this point, a Pascal parser, and assembler (for Z80) were all that existed which were usable on the IBM-PC. From 1993 to 1994, the assembler was made modular to target multiple CPUs including the 80386, a linker to replace the Z80 assembly language linker was created, and a Pascal compiler front end was finished to output to intermediate code. Finally, an intermediate code simulator was constructed, in Pascal, to prove the system out. In 1994, the simulator was used to extend the ISO 7185 IP Pascal \\"core\\" language to include features such as dynamic arrays. In 1995, a \\"check encoder\\" was created to target 80386 machine code, and a converter program created to take the output object files and create a \\"Portable Executable\\" file for Windows. The system support library was created for IP Pascal, itself in IP Pascal. This was an unusual step taken to prevent having to later recode the library from assembly or another Pascal to IP Pascal, but with the problem that both the 80386 code generator and the library would have to be debugged together. At the beginning of 1996, the original target of Windows NT was switched to Windows 95, and IP Pascal became fully operational as an 80386 compiler under Windows. The system bootstrapped itself, and the remaining Pascal code was ported from SVS Pascal to IP Pascal to complete the bootstrap. This process was aided considerably by the ability of the DPMI based SVS Pascal to run under Windows 95, which meant that the need to boot back and forth between DOS and Windows 95 was eliminated. = The Linux implementation = In 2000, a Linux (Red Hat) version was created for text mode only. This implementation directly uses the system calls and avoids the use of glibc, and thus creates thinner binaries than if the full support system needed for C were used, at the cost of binary portability. The plan is to create a version of the text library that uses termcap info, and the graphical library under X11. = Steps to \\"write once, run anywhere\\" = In 1997, a version of the terminal library from the original 1980 IP Pascal was ported to windows, and a final encoder started for the 80386. However, the main reason for needing an improved encoder, execution speed, was largely made irrelevant by increases in processor speed in the IBM-PC. As a result, the new encoder wasn't finished until 2003. In 2001, a companion program to IP Pascal was created to translate C header files to Pascal header files. This was meant to replace the manual method of creating operating system interfaces for IP Pascal. In 2003, a fully graphical, operating system independent module was created for IP Pascal. In 2005, the windows management and widget kit was added. = Lessons = In retrospect, the biggest error in the Z80 version was its single-pass structure. There was no real reason for it; the author's preceding (Basic) compiler was multiple pass with intermediate storage. The only argument for it was that single-pass compilation was supposed to be faster. However, single-pass compiling turns out to be a bad match for small machines, and isn't likely to help the advanced optimizations common in large machines. Further, the single pass aspect slowed or prevented getting the compiler bootstrapped out of Z80 assembly language and onto Pascal itself. Since the compiler was monolithic, the conversion to Pascal could not be done one section at a time, but had to proceed as a wholesale replacement. When replacement was started, the project lasted longer than the machine did. The biggest help that two pass compiling gave the I80386 implementation was the maintenance of a standard book of intermediate instructions which communicated between front and back ends of the compiler. This well understood \\"stage\\" of compilation reduced overall complexity. Intuitively, when two programs of equal size are mated intimately, the complexity is not additive, but multiplicative, because the connections between the program halves multiply out of control. Another lesson from the Z80 days, which was corrected on the 80386 compiler, was to write as much of the code as possible into Pascal itself, even the support library. Having the 80386 support code all written in Pascal has made it so modular and portable that most of it was moved out of the operating system specific area and into the \\"common code\\" library section, a section reserved for code that never changes for each machine and operating system. Even the \\"system specific\\" code needs modification only slightly from implementation to implementation. The result is great amounts of implementation work saved while porting the system. Finally, it was an error to enter into a second round of optimization before bootstrapping the compiler. Although the enhancement of the output code was considerable, the resulting increase in complexity of the compiler caused problems with the limited address space. At the time, better optimized code was seen to be an enabler to bootstrapping the code in Pascal. In retrospect, the remaining assembly written sections WERE the problem, and needed to be eliminated, the sooner the better. Another way to say this is that the space problems could be transient, but having significant program sections written in assembly are a serious and lasting problem.

It was meant as an interim standard, to be in effect for about two years until a commercial standard was developed. Unlike previous efforts like the seminal \\"2167A\\" which was mainly focused on the risky new area of software development, \\"498\\" was the first attempt at a truly comprehensive description of the systems development life-cycle. It was the baseline that all of the ISO, IEEE, and related efforts after it replaced. It also contains much of the material that the subsequent professionalization of project management covered in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The document \\"MIL-STD-498 Overview and Tailoring Guidebook\\" is 98 pages. The \\"MIL-STD-498 Application and Reference Guidebook\\" is 516 pages. Associated to these were document templates, or Data Item Descriptions, described below, bringing documentation and process order that could scale to projects of the size humans were then conducting (aircraft, battleships, canals, dams, factories, satellites, submarines, etcetera). It was one of the few military standards that survived the \\"Perry Memo\\", then U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's 1994 memorandum commanding the discontinuation of defense standards. However, it was canceled on May 27, 1998 and replaced by the essentially identical demilitarized version EIA J-STD-016 as a process example guide for IEEE 12207. Several programs outside of the U.S. military continued to use the standard due to familiarity and perceived advantages over alternative standards, such as free availability of the standards documents and presence of process detail including contractually-usable Data Item Descriptions.  Data Item Descriptions  MIL-STD-498 standard describes the development and documentation in terms of 22 Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) from which an effort will select to conduct the system development and support efforts. Each DID generically describes the required content of a data item, a file or document that describes the system or some aspect of the system life- cycle. These documents could take many forms, from source code, to installation scripts, to various electronic and paper reports, and the contracting party (e.g., the government) is encouraged to specify acceptable formats. Any data item description is tailored for a specific contract, meaning sections not desired for a particular effort are identified as not to be provided as part of identifying the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) of what items are to be produced and delivered by a contractor. Exactly which DIDs and what parts of the DIDs are required for a particular system depends on the nature of the project and how parts of it are being produced by contract(s).

He is best known for being the inventor of a packet-switched, \\"Ships in the Night,\\" multiple-protocol router in 1981, during his 20-year tenure at Stanford's Knowledge Systems Laboratory as well as the Stanford University Computer Science department.Valley of the Nerds: Who Really Invented the Multiprotocol Router, and Why Should We Care?, Public Broadcasting Service, Accessed August 12, 2007.Router Man, NetworkWorld, Accessed August 12, 2007. The code routed Parc Universal Packet (PUP), XNS, IP and CHAOSNet. The router used Bill's Network Operating System (NOS). The NOS also supported the EtherTIPS that were used throughout the Stanford LAN for terminal access to both the LAN and the Internet. This code was licensed by Cisco Systems in 1987 and comprised the core of the first Cisco IOS.Pete Carey, \\"A Start-Up's True Tale: Often-told story of Cisco's launch leaves out the drama, intrigue\\", San Jose Mercury News, December 1, 2001. This provided the groundwork for a new, global communications approach. He is also known for his role in the creation of the IMAP mail protocol. In 1984 he conceived of a client/server protocol, designed its functionality, applied for and received the grant money for its implementation. In 1985 Mark Crispin was hired to work with Bill on what became the IMAP protocol. Along with Mark, who implemented the protocols details and wrote the first client, MMD, Bill wrote the first Unix IMAP server. Bill later implemented MacMM which was the first MacIntosh IMAP client. Frank Gilmurray assisted with the initial part of this implementation. At Stanford in 1979 Bill wrote the ttyftp serial line file transfer program, which was developed into the MacIntosh version of the Kermit protocol at Columbia University. He was initially hired in August 1975 as a member of Dr. Elliott Levanthal's Instrumentation Research Laboratory. Here, Bill was responsible for a small computer laboratory for biomedical applications of mass spectrometry. This laboratory in conjunction with several chemists, and the Department of inherited rare diseases in the medical school made significant inroads in identifying inherited rare diseases from the gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer data generated from blood and urine samples of sick children. His significant accomplishment was to complete a prototype program initiated by Dr. R. Geoff Dromey R Geoff Dromey Biography called CLEANUP. This program \\"extracted representative spectra from GC/MS data,\\"Waller, George R, Dermer, Otis C, Biochemical Applications of Mass Spectrometry, 1980, pages 55-77 and was later used by the EPA to detect water pollutants. From 1970 to 1975 he worked at NASA Ames Research Center where he wrote, as a part of the Pioneer 10/11 mission control operating system, both the telemetry monitoring and real time display of the images of Jupiter. After his tenure at Stanford he worked for 10 years at Sun Microsystems. At Sun as the CTO of Project JXTA he filed 40 US Patents, and along with Rita Yu Chen, designed and implemented the JXTA security solutions. In 2002 he along with Jeff Altman, then a contributor to the JXTA Open Source community, initiated the effort to establish the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Peer-to-Peer working group. The working group was created in 2003. Bill was the working group chair until 2005. As Chief Scientist at Peerouette, Inc., he filed 2 US and 2 European Union Patents. He has so far been granted 20 US Patents 4 of which are on the SIMS High Performance Email Servers which he invented and with a small team of engineers implemented, and 16 on P2P and distributed computing. In the Summer of 1999 under the guidance of Greg Papadopoulos, Sun's CTO, and reporting directly to Carl Cargill, Sun's director of corporate standards,Carl Cargill led Sun's WAP Forum team with the major objective, \\"... to work with the WAP Forum on the convergence of the WAP protocol suite with IETF, W3C and Java standards.\\" Press release During this same period of time he invented the iPlanet Wireless Services. The latter was a Java proxy between IMAP Mail servers and either WAP Servers, or Web Browers. It proxied the following markup languages: The Handheld Device Markup Language, HDML, the Wireless Markup Language, WML, as well as HTML. This was a one person project supported by SFR/Cegetel in France. The primary goal was to enable email service to WAP phones. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964; his master's degree in mathematics from San Jose State University in San Jose, California, in 1966; and completed his doctoral course work at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington in 1970. Then decided to abandon mathematics for a career in software engineering and research to the skepticism of his thesis advisor because Bill thought the future was in computing.

It includes the Cabbagetown District, a historic district listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. History The Atlanta Rolling Mill was destroyed after the Battle of Atlanta and on its site the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill began operations in 1881. Cabbagetown was built as the surrounding mill town and was one of the first textile processing mills built in the south. Its primary product was cotton bags for packaging agricultural products. Built during a period when many industries were relocating to the post-Reconstruction South in search of cheap labor, it opened shortly following the International Cotton Exposition, which was held in Atlanta in an effort to attract investment to the region. The mill was owned and operated by Jacob Elsas, a German Jewish immigrant. Its work force consisted of poor whites recruited from the Appalachian region of north Georgia. Elsas built a small community of one and two-story shotgun houses and cottage-style houses surrounding the mill, originally known as Factory Town or Fulton Mill Village. Like most mill towns, the streets are extremely narrow with short blocks and many intersections. There are a few explanations as to how the neighborhood received its current name. One is that the mostly transplanted poor Appalachian residents, largely of Scots-Irish descent, who worked in the nearby Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill would grow cabbages in the front yards of their houses, so that one could distinctly smell the odor of cooking cabbage coming from the neighborhood. This term was used originally with derision by people outside the neighborhood, but it soon became a label of pride for the people who lived there. A variation of this legend is that a Ford Model T took a sharp turn at one of the main intersections of Cabbagetown, flipped, and spilled its cargo of cabbages across the street. Yet another story involves a neighborhood baseball team,How did Factory Town become Cabbagetown? \\"The story of how a neighborhood gets a name\\", Wyatt Williams, Creative Loafing, March 29, 2012 while Atlanta History Center documents show references to the name Pearl Park, after the daughter of a developer who built houses directly to the east of the mill houses near modern-day Pearl Street. At its height, the mill employed 2,600 people. A protracted strike in 1914-15 failed to unionize the factory's workforce. For over half a century Cabbagetown remained home to a tight-knit, homogenous, and semi-isolated community of people whose lives were anchored by the mill, until it closed in 1977. While the mill itself was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, the surrounding neighborhood went into a steep decline following the mill closure. Street scene in Cabbagetown Accompanying the initialization of Atlanta's intown renaissance in the early 1990s, Cabbagetown underwent tremendous growth. As with many other east side neighborhoods, revitalization was sparked by an influx of artists in the 1980s, including Panorama Ray, who operated a photo gallery on the main drag, Carroll Street. Since his death in 1997, Carroll Street has become the home popular restaurants and serves as a neighborhood gathering spot. Carroll Street at night, with smokestack of Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill in background Beginning in 1996, the mill itself has been renovated into the nation's largest residential loft community ‚Äî the Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts ‚Äî which houses everyone from artists and musicians to business professionals. In April 1999, a five-alarm fire severely damaged the east building which was still being renovated and several nearby homes were destroyed. The lofts nevertheless opened the following year. However, a tornado in March 2008 damaged parts of the loft complex and many of the historic homes and businesses in Cabbagetown.

It was first introduced in 1929 by √âlie Cartan to study the topology of Lie groups and homogeneous spaces by relating cohomological methods of Georges de Rham to properties of the Lie algebra. It was later extended by to coefficients in an arbitrary Lie module. Motivation If G is a compact simply connected Lie group, then it is determined by its Lie algebra, so it should be possible to calculate its cohomology from the Lie algebra. This can be done as follows. Its cohomology is the de Rham cohomology of the complex of differential forms on G. Using an averaging process, this complex can be replaced by the complex of left-invariant differential forms. The left- invariant forms, meanwhile, are determined by their values at the identity, so that the space of left-invariant differential forms can be identified with the exterior algebra of the Lie algebra, with a suitable differential. The construction of this differential on an exterior algebra makes sense for any Lie algebra, so it is used to define Lie algebra cohomology for all Lie algebras. More generally one uses a similar construction to define Lie algebra cohomology with coefficients in a module. If G is a simply connected noncompact Lie group, the Lie algebra cohomology of the associated Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g does not necessarily reproduce the de Rham cohomology of G. The reason for this is that the passage from the complex of all differential forms to the complex of left-invariant differential forms uses an averaging process that only makes sense for compact groups. Definition Let \\\\mathfrak g be a Lie algebra over a commutative ring R with universal enveloping algebra U\\\\mathfrak g, and let M be a representation of \\\\mathfrak g (equivalently, a U\\\\mathfrak g-module). Considering R as a trivial representation of \\\\mathfrak g, one defines the cohomology groups :\\\\mathrm{H}^n(\\\\mathfrak{g}; M) := \\\\mathrm{Ext}^n_{U\\\\mathfrak{g}}(R, M) (see Ext functor for the definition of Ext). Equivalently, these are the right derived functors of the left exact invariant submodule functor :M \\\\mapsto M^{\\\\mathfrak{g}} := \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in M \\\\mid xm = 0\\\\ \\\\text{ for all } x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\\\\\}. Analogously, one can define Lie algebra homology as :\\\\mathrm{H}_n(\\\\mathfrak{g}; M) := \\\\mathrm{Tor}_n^{U\\\\mathfrak{g}}(R, M) (see Tor functor for the definition of Tor), which is equivalent to the left derived functors of the right exact coinvariants functor : M \\\\mapsto M_{\\\\mathfrak{g}} := M / \\\\mathfrak{g} M. Some important basic results about the cohomology of Lie algebras include Whitehead's lemmas, Weyl's theorem, and the Levi decomposition theorem. Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg complex Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a Lie algebra over a field k, with a left action on the \\\\mathfrak{g}-module M. The elements of the Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg complex : \\\\mathrm{Hom}_k(\\\\Lambda^\\\\bullet\\\\mathfrak{g},M) are called cochains from \\\\mathfrak{g} to M. A homogeneous n-cochain from \\\\mathfrak{g} to M is thus an alternating k-multilinear function f\\\\colon\\\\Lambda^n\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to M. The Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg complex is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product M \\\\otimes \\\\Lambda^{\\\\bullet}\\\\mathfrak{g}^*, where \\\\mathfrak{g}^*denotes the dual vector space of \\\\mathfrak{g}. The Lie bracket [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot]\\\\colon \\\\Lambda^2 \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{g} on \\\\mathfrak{g} induces a transpose application d^{(1)}_{\\\\mathfrak{g}} \\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{g}^* \\\\rightarrow \\\\Lambda^2 \\\\mathfrak{g}^* by duality. The latter is sufficient to define a derivation d_{\\\\mathfrak{g}} of the complex of cochains from \\\\mathfrak{g} to k by extending d_{\\\\mathfrak{g}}^{(1)}according to the graded Leibniz rule. It follows from the Jacobi identity that d_{\\\\mathfrak{g}} satisfies d_{\\\\mathfrak{g}}^2 = 0 and is in fact a differential. In this setting, k is viewed as a trivial \\\\mathfrak{g}-module while k \\\\sim \\\\Lambda^0\\\\mathfrak{g}^* \\\\subseteq \\\\mathrm{Ker}(d_{\\\\mathfrak{g}}) may be thought of as constants. In general, let \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}(\\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\mathrm{End}(M)) denote the left action of \\\\mathfrak{g} on M and regard it as an application d_\\\\gamma^{(0)} \\\\colon M \\\\rightarrow M \\\\otimes \\\\mathfrak{g}^*. The Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg differential d is then the unique derivation extending d_\\\\gamma^{(0)} and d_{\\\\mathfrak{g}}^{(1)} according to the graded Leibniz rule, the nilpotency condition d^2 = 0 following from the Lie algebra homomorphism from \\\\mathfrak{g} to \\\\mathrm{End}(M) and the Jacobi identity in \\\\mathfrak{g}. Explicitly, the differential of the n-cochain f is the (n+1)-cochain df given by: \\\\begin{align} (d f)\\\\left(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_{n+1}\\\\right) = &\\\\sum_i (-1)^{i+1}x_i\\\\, f\\\\left(x_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\hat x_i, \\\\ldots, x_{n+1}\\\\right) +  &\\\\sum_{i where the caret signifies omitting that argument. When G is a real Lie group with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}, the Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg complex may also be canonically identified with the space of left-invariant forms with values in M, denoted by \\\\Omega^{\\\\bullet}(G,M)^G. The Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg differential may then be thought of as a restriction of the covariant derivative on the trivial fiber bundle G \\\\times M \\\\rightarrow G, equipped with the equivariant connection \\\\tilde{\\\\gamma} \\\\in \\\\Omega^1(G,\\\\mathrm{End}(M)) associated with the left action \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Hom}(\\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\mathrm{End}(M)) of \\\\mathfrak{g} on M. In the particular case where M = k = \\\\mathbb{R} is equipped with the trivial action of \\\\mathfrak{g}, the Chevalley‚ÄìEilenberg differential coincides with the restriction of the de Rham differential on \\\\Omega^{\\\\bullet}(G) to the subspace of left-invariant differential forms. Cohomology in small dimensions The zeroth cohomology group is (by definition) the invariants of the Lie algebra acting on the module: :H^0(\\\\mathfrak{g}; M) =M^{\\\\mathfrak{g}} = \\\\\\\\{ m \\\\in M \\\\mid xm = 0\\\\ \\\\text{ for all } x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\\\\\}. The first cohomology group is the space of derivations modulo the space of inner derivations :H^1(\\\\mathfrak{g}; M) = \\\\mathrm{Der}(\\\\mathfrak{g}, M)/\\\\mathrm{Ider} (\\\\mathfrak{g}, M)\\\\, , where a derivation is a map d from the Lie algebra to M such that :d[x,y] = xdy-ydx~ and is called inner if it is given by :dx = xa~ for some a in M. The second cohomology group :H^2(\\\\mathfrak{g}; M) is the space of equivalence classes of Lie algebra extensions :0\\\\rightarrow M\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\rightarrow 0 of the Lie algebra by the module M. Similarly, any element of the cohomology group H^{n+1}(\\\\mathfrak{g}; M) gives an equivalence class of ways to extend the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} to a \\"Lie n-algebra\\" with \\\\mathfrak{g} in grade zero and M in grade n. A Lie n-algebra is a homotopy Lie algebra with nonzero terms only in degrees 0 through n.

United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928), was a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court reviewed whether the use of wiretapped private telephone conversations, obtained by federal agents without judicial approval and subsequently used as evidence, constituted a violation of the defendant‚Äôs rights provided by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Court held that neither the Fourth Amendment nor the Fifth Amendment rights of the defendant were violated. This decision was later overturned by Katz v. United States in 1967. The case =Background information= Until 1914, the American judicial system, including the Supreme Court of the United States, largely followed the precepts of English common law when it came to matters dealing with the validity of introducing evidence in criminal trials. In most cases, the general philosophy was that the process by which the evidence was obtained had little to do with admissibility in court. The only limiting factor was that the police agents could not break the law to seize the evidence; however, since what is now illegal seizure was then permitted by the courts, it rarely presented a significant challenge. In 1914, however, in the landmark case of Weeks v. United States, the Court held unanimously that illegal seizure of items from a private residence was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and established the exclusionary rule that prohibits admission of illegally obtained evidence in federal courts. Because the Bill of Rights did not at the time extend to cover states, such a prohibition extended only to federal agents and covered only federal trials. It was not until the case of Mapp v. Ohio (1961) that the exclusionary rule was extended to state courts as well. The question here, then, was whether the recordings of wiretapped private telephone conversations constituted impermissibly-seized evidence and thus constituted a violation of the federal exclusionary rule. =Case details= The case concerned several petitioners, including Roy Olmstead, who challenged their convictions, arguing that the use of evidence of wiretapped private telephone conversations amounted to a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The petitioners were convicted for alleged conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act by unlawfully possessing, transporting, and selling alcohol. Seventy-two additional persons, aside from the petitioners, were indicted. The evidence provided by the wiretapped telephone conversations disclosed \\"a conspiracy of amazing magnitude\\" to engage in bootlegging, involving the employment of some fifty persons, use of sea vessels for transportation, an underground storage facility in Seattle, and the maintenance of a central office fully equipped with executives, bookkeepers, salesmen, and an attorney. According to the record, even in a bad month, the sales amounted to some $176,000; the grand total for a year probably came out to some $2 million. Olmstead was the general manager of this business, receiving fifty percent of all the profits. The information that led to the discovery of his involvement and the conspiracy itself was largely obtained by four federal Prohibition officers who were able to intercept messages on his and other conspirators' telephones. No laws were violated in installing the wiretapping equipment, as the officers did not trespass upon either the homes or the offices of the defendants; instead, the equipment was placed in the streets near the houses and in the basement of the large office building. The wiretapping went on for several months, and the records revealed significant details on the business transactions of the petitioners and their employees. Stenographic notes were made of the conversations, and their accuracy was testified to by the government witnesses. The evidence disclosed full details of the operations of the bootlegging business; in addition, it showed the relationship between Olmstead with members of the Seattle police, which resulted in prompt release of some of the arrested members of the conspiracy and promises to officers of payment. =Opinions= Chief Justice William Howard Taft delivered the opinion of the Court. Chief Justice Taft Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Taft was joined by Justices McReynolds, Sanford, Sutherland, and Van Devanter. After outlining the factual and procedural history of the case, Chief Justice Taft lists the relevant amendments ‚Äì the Fourth and Fifth ‚Äì and proceeds to examine the legal matters and precedents in question. Boyd v. United States concerned the Act of June 22, 1874 (19 USCA 535), which provided per section 5, a United States attorney with the power to use a marshal to obtain evidence that the defendant had refused to provide, in cases that were not criminal under the revenue laws. The Court held that Act of 1874 was a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, even though it did not constitute a clear case of search and seizure. Chief Justice Taft next examines \\"perhaps the most important\\" case, Weeks v. United States,Weeks v. United States, which involved a conviction for using the mail to transport lottery tickets. The defendant was arrested by a police officer without a warrant, and subsequent to the arrest, the defendant‚Äôs house was searched and a number of papers and articles was seized despite the lack of a search warrant. Although the defendant applied for and successfully obtained a court order directing the return of his property, he was denied return of relevant evidence. He appealed; the Court held that such taking of papers was in violation of the constitutional rights of the defendant, and that the trial court could not permit their use at trial. Chief Justice Taft cites several other cases (Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States,Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, Amos v. United States,Amos v. United States, Gouled v. United States,Gouled v. United States, and Agnello v. United StatesAgnello v. United States, ), and concludes that there is no permissible way to apply the Fifth Amendment to this case unless it could be shown that the Fourth Amendment was first violated. In this instance, there is no evidence that the defendants were in any way compelled to talk over their telephones, and were voluntarily engaging in business. Thus, ‚Äúour consideration must be confined to the Fourth Amendment.‚Äù Taft writes that the aggregate outcome of the Weeks case and those that followed it was that the Fourth Amendment forbade the introduction of evidence in court if it had been obtained in violation of the amendment. This is in compliance with the historical purpose of the Fourth Amendment, as it was in part intended to prevent the use of governmental force to search and seize a man‚Äôs personal property and effects. While it may seem that the language of Justice Field in ex parte Jacksonex parte Jackson, could be viewed as an analogy to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment qua wiretapping, Taft believes that the analogy fails. The Fourth Amendment applies to sealed letters in the mail because there exists a constitutional provision for the federal postal office and the relationship between the government and those ‚Äúwho pay to secure protection of their sealed letters.‚Äù However, the United States does not take such care with telegraphic and telephonic messages as it applies to mailed sealed letters, and Taft is quite emphatic in drawing the distinction: \\"The amendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no searching. There was no seizure. The evidence was secured by the use of the sense of hearing and that only. There was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendants.\\" He points out that one can talk with another at a great distance via telephone, and suggests that because the connecting wires were not a part of either the petitioners‚Äô houses or offices, they cannot be held subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment. Taft, in keeping with his personal judicial philosophy, suggests that Congress may \\"of course\\" extend such protections to telephone conversations by passing direct legislation that would prohibit their use in federal criminal trials. Until such legislation is passed, however, \\"the courts may not adopt such a policy by attributing an enlarged and unusual meaning to the Fourth Amendment,\\" as there are no precedents that permit the Fourth Amendment to apply as a viable defense in cases where there had been no official search and seizure of the person, his papers, tangible material effects, or an actual physical invasion of property. He concludes that such wiretapping as occurred in this case did not amount to a search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Associate Justice Brandeis Associate Justice Louis Brandeis wrote a dissenting opinion that in subsequent years became very famous. In 2018 the \\"famous dissent\\" was cited affirmatively by the majority opinion in Carpenter v. United States for the proposition that the United States Supreme Court is obligated to ensure that the \\"progress of science\\" does not erode Fourth Amendment protections as \\"subtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy... become available to the Government\\". Brandeis's dissent begins by noting that the Government made no attempt to defend the methods employed by federal agents, and, in fact, conceded that if wiretapping could be deemed a search or seizure, such wiretapping as took place in this case would be unreasonable search and seizure and thus inadmissible in court. However, it claimed that the protections of the amendment do not extend to telephone conversations. Brandeis attacks the proposition that expanding the Fourth Amendment to include protection of telephone conversations was inappropriate. At the time of the adoption of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, he writes, ‚Äúforce and violence‚Äù were the only means by which the government could compel self-incrimination. Thus, the protections offered by these Amendments were necessarily limited to address only imaginable forms of such force and violence. However, with the technological advances, the government has received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, there is no reason to think that the rate of such technological advances will slow down. ‚ÄúCan it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?‚Äù, Brandeis asks. He answers that a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.Boyd v. United States, Brandeis argues that the mail is a public service furnished by the government, and the telephone is \\"a public service furnished by its authority.\\" He concludes that there is no difference between a private telephone conversation and a sealed letter. In fact, he writes, \\"the evil incident to invasion of the privacy of the telephone is far greater than that involved in tampering with the mails.\\" In its past rulings, the Court has refused to read a literal construction of the Fourth Amendment, most notably in the Boyd case. Unjustified search and seizure violate the Fourth Amendment, and it does not matter what type of papers were seized, whether the papers were in an office or a home, whether the papers were seized by force, etc. The protection guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments are broad in scope. The framers of the Constitution sought \\"to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions, and their sensations.\\" It is for this reason that they established, as against the government, the right to be let alone as \\"the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right, every unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And the use, as evidence in a criminal proceeding, of facts ascertained by such intrusion must be deemed a violation of the Fifth.\\" Brandeis argues further that even independently of the constitutional question, the judgment should be reversed. By the law of Washington, wiretapping is a crime, and a federal court should not permit a prosecution that makes use of such crime to continue. The Eighteenth Amendment did not empower Congress to authorize anyone, federal agents or not, to violate the criminal laws of a state; nor has Congress ever purported to do so. These unlawful acts were not directed by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury; they were committed by individual officers. Thus, the government was innocent from a legal point of view, since it did not direct its agents to commit a crime on its behalf. However, when it sought to \\"avail itself of the fruits of these acts\\" to convict the defendants, \\"it assumed moral responsibility for the officers' crimes.\\" If the Supreme Court were to permit the government to punish the defendants by the sole means of its officers‚Äô transgressions, it would present all the elements of a ratification. \\"If so, the government itself would become a lawbreaker.\\" Brandeis cites an old maxim of unclean hands, inherited from courts of equity, whereby a court will not redress a wrong when he who has requested its aid has unclean hands. This principle, he believes, is very much relevant here. The Court should deny its aid in order to maintain respect for law to promote confidence in the administration of justice and preserve the judicial process from contamination. We must subject government officials to the same rules of conduct that we expect of the citizen. The very existence of the government is imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. As Brandeis puts it, \\"if the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means‚Äîto declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal‚Äîwould bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should resolutely set its face.\\" Justice Brandeis' opinion was quoted by Timothy McVeigh at his trial for the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. After remaining silent throughout his trial, he was asked before sentencing if he would like to make a statement. He responded \\"I wish instead to use the words of Justice Brandeis dissenting in Olmstead to speak for me. He wrote 'Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.'\\" Associate Justice Holmes Citing the extensive dissent filed by Brandeis, Holmes says that he need \\"add but a few words.\\" While he is not ready to say that the penumbra of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments covers the defendant, he does concur that even apart from the Constitution, the government should be prohibited to use evidence obtained (and only obtainable) by a criminal act. Holmes writes that in his opinion, it would be a lesser evil that some criminals should escape prosecution than that the government \\"should play an ignoble part.\\" Associate Justice Butler Justice Butler begins his dissent by registering his regret for being unable to support the opinion and judgments of the Court. Because the writ of certiorari limited the counsel‚Äôs arguments only to the constitutional question, he writes that it does not participate in the controversy of the admissibility of evidence because \\"the mode of obtaining it was unethical and a misdemeanor under state law.\\" The sole question that he considers is whether the government may direct its officers to engage in wiretapping without violating the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. Butler writes that though there was no direct search and seizure in Boyd v. United States, the Court still found such exercise as occurred in that case to be in violation of the constitutional protections afforded to the criminal defendant. The Court does not limit its decisions to the literal meaning of the words of the Constitution. \\"Under the principles established and applied by this court, the Fourth Amendment safeguards against all evils that are like and equivalent to those embraced within the ordinary meaning of its words.\\" Thus, when all these facts are evaluated, Butler concludes \\"with great deference,\\" that the petitioners should be given a new trial. Associate Justice Stone Justice Stone concurs in the opinions of Justice Holmes and Justice Brandeis, and also with that of Justice Butler insofar as it deals with the merits. Though the order granting certiorari did indeed limit the argument to a single question, Justice Stone does not believe that it prevents the Court from considering any questions present in the record. Aftermath Mr. Olmstead spent his 4 year prison sentence at the McNeil Island Correctional Institute. He then became a carpenter. On December 25, 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt granted him a full presidential pardon. Besides restoring his constitutional rights, the pardon remitted him $10,300 dollars in costs (about $ in today's dollars). Eventually, Mr. Olmstead became a well-known, full-time Christian Science practitioner, who also worked with prison inmates on an anti-alcoholism agenda for decades until his death in April 1966 at the age of 79--just over a year and a half before the Supreme Court issued its decision in Katz v. United States reversing its holding against him. This overrule rejected the conclusion of Olmstead v. United States, by insisting that the Fourth Amendment was not \\"limited to certain areas or to tangible objects\\". See also *Elkins v.

The excess heat from this generator was to be used by a wood products processing company. The original proposal came in 1999, and was revised twice in 2000 and 2001. It was approved in 2004 by the governor of Washington state. A power transmission line was to be constructed to a sub-station in Abbotsford, British Columbia but the Canadian National Energy BoardNEB project files in 2004 and the Supreme Court of Canada in 2006 denied permission to construct the transmission line. Sumas Energy 2.inc, the company behind the proposal, requested that the Washington's Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council terminate their Site Certification Agreement. This occurred in April 2006. There is already a cogeneration plant in Sumas [SE1]. This proposal would have added a second plant [SE2]. This proposal was considered controversial because it burns natural gas to generate power and the resulting pollutants would have drifted up the valley, adding to pollution already generated by the populous Lower Mainland of British Columbia, which includes Vancouver. The proposed second plant would be five times larger than the existing plant. The proposed site was over an active fault, placing the proposed 16 inch high pressure natural gas line and tanks containing hazardous fuels and chemicals in danger. A high pressure natural gas line had just recently exploded in the foothills near the proposed site due to shifting soils. An aquifer serving much of Whatcom County and Abbotsford, British Columbia is located directly beneath the site. The site is in a floodplain that has experienced recent floods strong enough to sweep vehicles off roadways. The proposed fill for the plant would displace floodwaters onto neighboring farms and homes, increasing flood depths by up to a foot. Air emissions from the plant were predicted to be up to 3 tons per day of criteria pollutants. The Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council initially denied the project, but NESCO resubmitted their application for reconsideration without the diesel component that was contained in their initial application. The National Energy Board received approximately 25,000 letters regarding the project, mostly in opposition.NEB Exhibit List for Sumas 2 (approx. 25,000 letters catalogued) References Category:Canada‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Sumas 2"},{"id":"2096680","text":"United States federal research funders use the term cyberinfrastructure to describe research environments that support advanced data acquisition, data storage, data management, data integration, data mining, data visualization and other computing and information processing services distributed over the Internet beyond the scope of a single institution. In scientific usage, cyberinfrastructure is a technological and sociological solution to the problem of efficiently connecting laboratories, data, computers, and people with the goal of enabling derivation of novel scientific theories and knowledge. Origin The term National Information Infrastructure had been popularized by Al Gore in the 1990s. This use of the term \\"cyberinfrastructure\\" evolved from the same thinking that produced Presidential Decision Directive NSC-63Presidential Decision Directive NSC-63 on Protecting America's Critical Infrastructures (PDD-63). PDD-63 focuses on the security and vulnerability of the nation's \\"cyber-based information systems\\" as well as the critical infrastructures on which America's military strength and economic well-being depend, such as the electric power grid, transportation networks, potable water and wastewater infrastructures. The term \\"cyberinfrastructure\\" was used in a press briefing on PDD-63 on May 22, 1998 with Richard A. Clarke, then national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection, and counter-terrorism, and Jeffrey Hunker, who had just been named director of the critical infrastructure assurance office. Hunker stated: > \\"One of the key conclusions of the President's commission that laid the > intellectual framework for the President's announcement today was that while > we certainly have a history of some real attacks, some very serious, to our > cyber-infrastructure, the real threat lay in the future.

But we've been very successful as a > country and as an economy in wiring together our critical infrastructures. > This is a development that's taken place really over the last 10 or 15 > years‚Äîthe Internet, most obviously, but electric power, transportation > systems, our banking and financial systems.\\" The term \\"cyberinfrastructure\\" was used by a US National Science Foundation (NSF) blue-ribbon committee in 2003 in response to the question: how can NSF, as the nation's premier agency funding basic research, remove existing barriers to the rapid evolution of high performance computing, making it truly usable by all the nation's scientists, engineers, scholars, and citizens? The NSF use of the term focuses on the integrated assemblage of these information technologies with one another. A workshop on cyberinfrastructure for the social sciences was held in San Diego, California in May 2005. Another conference was held in January 2007 in Washington, D.C. A \\"CyberInfrastructure Partnership\\" existed from February 2005 until 2009. A collaboration led by the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and Boston University had a web site called \\"Engaging People in Cyberinfrastructure\\" (EPIC) which existed from 2005 through 2007. Two NSF sponsored workshops on Financial Cyberinfrastructure were organized in 2010 and 2012 by Louiqa Raschid and Albert \\"Pete\\" Kyle University of Maryland, H.V. Jagadish University of Michigan and Mark Flood Office of Financial Research, Department of the Treasury. Complementing the technical construction of cyberinfrastructure, social scientists in the field of computer supported cooperative work investigate the organizational and social aspects of building these large-scale, distributed resources to support science. Related to this research space is the notion of the collaboratory, originally coined by William Wulf. Cyberinfrastructure is more often called e-Science or e-Research. In particular, the United Kingdom started an e-Science initiative in 2001.; the Systems Geology initiative of the British Geological Survey is an example. Others distinguish e-Science as the work that is done using the cyberinfrastructure. There are many inter-governmental advisory groups related to Cyberinfrastructure aspects like E-Infrastructures Reflection Group and European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures dealing with policies on electronic infrastructures for research, i.e. research networks, computing, software and data infrastructures that mainly serve students, researchers and scientists. They advise and recommend actions towards the European Commission (DG CONNECT), the EU Member states governments (Research or Science Ministries), e-Infrastructure providers and users.  Examples NSF's Office of Cyberinfrastructure, for example, supported the TeraGrid project in which the Grid Infrastructure Group led by University of Chicago provided integration of resources and services that were operated by some of the US's supercomputing centers. This project has now evolved to the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project, led by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The nanoHUB and its HUBzero software originally funded in 2002 is an important cyberinfrastructure that is seeing continued usage. Cyberinfrastructure is often specialized toward domains in science and engineering. For example, NSF funded a large cyberinfrastructure for earthquake engineering called NEEShub at Purdue University from 2009-15. NSF funded the iPlant Collaborative in 2008 to support plant sciences, including data-intensive plant genomics and phylogenetics. Mississippi State University created an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) cyberinfrastructure in 2010 that focuses on multiscale modeling. The United States Department of Energy supports e-Science through high performance computing and other initiatives involving its laboratories, including: *Argonne National Laboratory *Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory *Stanford Linear Accelerator Center *Oak Ridge National Laboratory *Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory The Department of Energy (Office of Science SciDAC-2 program from the High Energy Physics, Nuclear Physics and Advanced Software and Computing Research programs) and NSF (Math and Physical Sciences, Office of Cyberinfrastructure and Office of International Science and Engineering Directorates) support the Open Science Grid which is a consortium of more than 80 member institutions and alliances.

George Clyde Nowlan, (14 August 1898 - 31 May 1965) was a Canadian member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, he served from 9 August 1962-21 April 1963 as the Minister of Finance in the administration of John Diefenbaker, and was also responsible for the CBC. In addition to serving as an MP, Nowlan was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War. After the war ended, he returned to the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia and attended Acadia University to study for a BA, graduating in 1920. He then studied law at Dalhousie University. Nowlan was an MLA in the Nova Scotia Legislature in the 1920s, and was always known for his reputation as a hard worker and a Party Man. He served a term as the Progressive Conservative Party's president. While serving as Minister of National Revenue in 1962, he forbid Customs to censor or ban entrance to any publication unless a Canadian court had already ruled it to be \\"obscene\\", rather than using their own discretion. Five years later, this was overturned.Petersen, Klaus & Allan C. Hutchinson. \\"Interpreting Censorship in Canada\\", University of Toronto Press, 1999. Disagreements between Nowlan and Diefenbaker are widely believed to have been at the heart of the PC government, allowing it to be reduced to a minority government in the 1962 federal election and then defeated a year later by a vote of no confidence by Lester Pearson and the Liberal Party in the 1963 election. His son Pat Nowlan later became a Progressive Conservative (and later Independent Progressive Conservative) MP in Nowlan's riding of Kings County.

Carboxylate salts are salts that have the general formula M(RCOO)n, where M is a metal and n is 1, 2,...; carboxylate esters have the general formula RCOOR‚Ä≤ (or RCO2R‚Ä≤). R and R‚Ä≤ are organic groups; R‚Ä≤ ‚â† H. A carboxylate ion is the conjugate base of a carboxylic acid, RCOO‚àí (or (or RCO2‚àí). It is an ion with negative charge.  Synthesis  Carboxylate ions can be formed by deprotonation of carboxylic acids. Such acids typically have pKa of approximately <5 meaning that they can be deprotonated by many bases, such as sodium hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate. RCO2H + NaOH -> RCO2Na + H2O  Resonance stabilization of the carboxylate ion  Carboxylic acids easily dissociate into a carboxylate anion and a positively charged hydrogen ion (proton), much more readily than alcohols do (into an alkoxide ion and a proton), because the carboxylate ion is stabilized by resonance. The negative charge that is left after deprotonation of the carboxyl group is delocalized between the two electronegative oxygen atoms in a resonance structure. If the R group is an electron-withdrawing group (such as -CF3), the basicity of the carboxylate will be further weakened. :Equivalence of the resonance forms the delocalised form of a general carboxylate anion This delocalization of the electron cloud means that both of the oxygen atoms are less strongly negatively charged; the positive proton is therefore less strongly attracted back to the carboxylate group once it has left; hence, the carboxylate ion is more stable and less basic as a result of resonance stabilization of the negative charge. In contrast, an alkoxide ion, once formed, would have a strong negative charge localized on its lone oxygen atom, which would strongly attract any nearby protons (indeed, alkoxides are very strong bases). Because of resonance stabilization, carboxylic acids have much lower pKa values (and are therefore stronger acids) than alcohols. For example, the pKa value of acetic acid is 4.9 while ethanol has a pKa of 16. Hence acetic acid is a much stronger acid than ethanol. This in turn means that for equimolar solutions of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, the carboxylic acid would have a much lower pH.  Reactions  = Nucleophilic Substitution = Carboxylate ions are good nucleophiles. They react with alkyl halides to form ester. The following reaction shows the reaction mechanism. SN2 reaction between sodium acetate and bromoethane. The products are ethyl acetate and sodium bromide. alt=none287x287px The nucleophilicity of carboxylate ions are much weaker than that of hydroxide and alkoxide ions, but stronger than halide anions (in a polar aprotic solvent, though there are other effects such as solubility of the ion). = Reduction = Unlike the reduction of ester, the reduction of carboxylate is different, due to the lack of the leaving group and the relatively electron-rich carbon atom (due to the negative charge on the oxygen atoms) . With small amount of acid, the reaction occurs with lithium aluminium hydride by changing the LAH into a Lewis acid, AlH3 in the process, converting the oxyanion to 4 Al-O bonds. 500x500px 507x507px Examples This list is for cases where there is a separate article for the anion or its derivatives.
