Background  Captain Kinnier was born on 20 October 1858, the second son of Robert Snodgrass Kinnier, a surgeon, and Agnes Corse Stirling, daughter of Glasgow manufacturer William Stirling and a niece of Hugh Auchincloss, the New York merchant.\\"The Eagle\\", 13 September 1958 He grew up in Saltcoats, Ayrshire until, against his father's wishes, he went to sea in 1874. On 20 May 1889 he married Minnie Agnes Martin and had five children: Major Douglas Reid Kinnier T.D., Hugh Stirling Kinnier, Anna Josephine Kinnier, Gertrude Kinnier and Captain Keith Robert Martin Kinnier, O.B.E.  The Ortega and the escape from the Dresden  On 18 September 1914 Captain Kinnier was the commander of the Ortega which was traveling southward along the Chilean coast from Valparaiso to Montevideo. In addition to a valuable cargo of ¬£117,000, the Ortega was carrying 300 French reservists as well as confidential mail from the Admiralty. When the Ortega was some 50 miles from the entrance to the Straits of Magellan through which she intended to pass, she sighted a German cruiser, Dresden, approaching on an opposite course. The Ortega was only capable of a maximum speed of 14 knots whereas the cruiser could achieve a speed of 20 knots. Captain Kinnier ordered a change of course for Cape George. Notwithstanding the ship's engineers achieved a speed of 18 knots, the Dresden soon came within range and a shot from her foremost gun fell alongside the ship as a signal to heave to. Captain Kinnier, however, ignored the signal, and continued on his course, driving the ship as fast as he could. The Dresden then opened fire in earnest, but the Ortega, stern on, did not present a large target and none of the shots took effect. Chancing all risks in the shallow and uncharted channels of Nelson Strait, Captain Kinnier succeeded in reaching waters where it was impossible for the Dresden to follow. Lowering some boats he sent then ahead of the ship to take soundings, and by following slowly in their wake, Captain Kinnier succeeded eventually in working his way through nearly one hundred miles of narrow and tortuous channel and emerged into the Straits of Magellan.The Weekly Historical Event, p. 97 Subsequently Captain Kinnier navigated his command into Smyth's Channel and thereafter Rio de Janeiro, \\"without even having a scratch on his plates\\".Naval and Military Record, 3 January 1917 In honour of his actions, Captain Kinnier was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by King George V who also conferred upon him an honorary lieutenancy in the Royal Naval Reserve. Captain Kinnier was later honoured by the French Government which presented him with a gold chronometer and by the Admiralty which gave him a silver plate in commemoration of his services during the First World War. Using the funds of a public subscription, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool presented Captain Kinnier with a silk Union flag which was later presented by the family to Saltcoats Burgh Council in May 1931.The Times, 27 December 1916Lloyd's List, 28 December 1916New York Herald, 29 December 1916  Later Accounts of the Escape of the Ortega  In his 1927 book, Sea Escapes and Adventures, Commander Taprell Dorling D.S.O. commemorated Kinnier's exploits thus: \\"Seldom have honours been better deserved. Pursued by a vessel which could have blown his ship out of the water with a single broadside, nobody could have blamed Captain Kinnier if he had hauled down his colours and surrendered. But this was not the sort of stuff of which British captains are made. Loyally helped by his officers and men, with great presence of mind and an excellent display of seamanship and navigation, he first escaped from his enemy and then brought his ship to safety through a channel dangerous enough to appal the stoutest heart, doing so without denting a single plate. Captain Kinnier had taken a huge risk, but came through with flying colours. His behaviour affords a shining example of the splendid spirit which animated the officers and men throughout those stormy and nerve-racking days of the worldwide war\\".1927, Philip Allan & Co. Ltd, pp. 180-187 Similar sentiments were expressed by Captain Frank Shaw in his history of the British Merchant Navy, Flag of the Seven Seas: \\"But this instance of British Merchant Navy resourcefulness is illuminating. In the very waters where Drake - himself a merchant seanman - displayed the courage and resourcefulness that blazoned the name of England through the then-known world, another merchantman, also inspired with the tradition of the sea, which demands of its devotees that there shall be no surrender so long as life persists, signally thwarted a greedy enemy and snatched a valuable ship and many more valuable lives from capture or possible death. Men like Captain Kinnier of the Ortega may not have monuments erected to their memory in Westminster Abbey, but they live enshrined in the hearts of patriots\\".1953, Cleaver-Hulmer Press, pp. 73-74 The escape of the Ortega was also used as the basis for the short novel Tom Chatto RNR.Philip McCutchan,1996, Weidenfeld & Nicolson Captain Kinnier died on Christmas Eve 1916 following surgery to repair an ulcer. He was buried in Bebington Cemetery on 30 December 1916.

She was the daughter of a poor farmer in Str√∂velstorp in the Scanian countryside. Her mother died when she was aged six. Her elder brother left the family and sought a new life in America. Always showing determination and ambition, she wanted to become more than just a farmer's wife and so, aged 21, in 1920, she learned to fly, becoming Sweden's first woman pilot. Her diploma was \\"no. 203\\". Not content with that, she went to Germany to learn parachute jumping. In 1922, Andersson was killed on her third jump in Askersund, Sweden. Thousands of spectators were gathering below on the ice of the frozen lake Alsen. She had trouble releasing her parachute, which finally unfolded only at a small distance from the treetops and she crashed violently into the ground. In 1926, the Swedish Aero Club erected a three-metre-high obelisk as a memorial in the place where she was found dead. Novel and film *In 1996 the Swedish novelist Jacques Werup adapted her life in his novel Den ofullbordade himlen (\\"The Imperfect Sky\\"). *In 2001 the novel was the basis for the film by Jan Troell S√• vit som en sn√∂ (a.k.a. As White as a Snow) in which Andersson was played by the actress Amanda Ooms. The film was awarded the Swedish critics' prize for best Swedish film of the year.

SLC-2 Radar SLC-02 counter battery radar of Myanmar Army SLC-2 radar can also be applied in adjusting firing of friendly weapons or rockets. With slight modification to software parameters the radar can also be used to detect and track low flying targets such as light aircraft, helicopters and RPVs. SLC-2 systems have sometimes been mounted on a Dongfang EQ2102 3.5 ton truck. Development Four AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar were sold to China, and these became the foundation of SLC-2 radar development. Aside from political reasons, the US$10 million plus unit price tag of TPQ-37 (including after sale logistic support) was simply too costly for Chinese. The decision was made to develop a domestic equivalent after mastering the technologies of TPQ-37. After the initial test of TPQ-37 in Tangshan (Ê±§Â±±) Range near Nanjing in 1988, and in Xuanhua District in October of the same year, several shortcomings of TPQ-37 were discovered and further intensive tests were conducted and completed in 1994. The requirement of the Chinese domestic equivalent was subsequently modified to address these issues revealed in trials. Due to the limitation of the Chinese industrial capability at the time, decision was made to develop the Chinese domestic equivalent in several steps. The first step was to develop a smaller one, which would result in the Chinese equivalent of AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar, and based on the experience gained from this program, a more capable larger version in the same class of AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar would be developed, which eventually resulted in SLC-2 series. Type 373 Radar This is the predecessor of SLC-2 radar, using older passive electronically scanned array technology. Type 373 radar is fielded after the Type 704 Radar series, which Type 373 radar is based on. Type 373 radar is designed to specifically improve the performance of TPQ-37 by solving the shortcoming revealed in tests. One of limitations of TPQ-37 revealed in tests was that the it was less effective against projectiles with flat trajectory, so it is much more effective against howitzer and mortar rounds than rounds from 130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46) and its Chinese derivative Type 59-1. Type 373 radar is designed to improve the capability against rounds with flat trajectory. Another problem revealed in the tests was that the reliability of TPQ-37 is much lower than what was claimed. The reason was that when TPQ-37 was deployed in environments with high humidity and high level of rainfall (southern China), high salinity (coastal regions), high altitude (southwestern China), and subjected to daily high temperature differences (northwestern China), malfunctions occurs more frequently. Type 373 radar was designed specifically to improve the reliability against these harsh environmental factors. SLC-2 As Chinese capability in microelectronics matured, an updated version of passive phased array Type 373 radar is developed, designated as SLC-2. This is a fully solid- state, highly digitized version that adopts planar active phased array antenna. One of the shortcomings of TPQ-37 revealed in tests was in its multi- targeting capability. When enemy artillery batteries located more than two hundred meters apart fires simultaneously, TPQ-37 could provide accurate coordinate for distance, but coordinates for positions were less accurate. This would not be a problem for most users because TPQ-37 can be used in pairs in conjunction, provide accurate coordinates for locations. However, these costly radars could not be purchased in large numbers and China thus developed the capability for SLC-2 to provide accurate coordinates for both distance and position.Myanmar Army currently operating as many as 27 SLC-2 radars for artillery force.

Biography He was born in Aranda de Duero, in Burgos, Old Castile, Spain. His father was in the military, and Guti√©rrez followed his father's footsteps by enlisting as a cadet in the Spanish army at the age of seven. He participated in Spanish military campaigns in Italy, the Falklands, Algiers, and in the 1779-1783 blockade of Gibraltar under General Mart√≠n Alvarez. Guti√©rrez also served as Commander of the island of Menorca. He was named Commander-General of the Canary Islands in 1791, and assumed this position on 31 January 1791; his predecessor in the position had been the Marquis of Branciforte. During the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797), Guti√©rrez was suffering from an attack of asthma, but he managed to defeat British forces under Horatio Nelson. Guti√©rrez allowed the British to leave with their arms and war honors. As a result of this victory, Guti√©rrez was granted the Encomienda of Esparragal in the Order of Alc√°ntara (a system of endowments) by Charles IV of Spain. Guti√©rrez's health continued to suffer and he was afflicted by an attack of paralysis on 22 April 1799. He died on 14 May that year at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and was buried in the chapel of Saint James the Great (Ap√≥stol Santiago) in the parish of La Concepci√≥n de Santa Cruz de Santiago de Tenerife.

The story is an adaptation of Sarah Waters' 2002 novel of the same name and follows the meeting of two very different young women and what madness ensues. Directed by Aisling Walsh, it stars Sally Hawkins, Imelda Staunton, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans and Charles Dance. The mini-series was nominated for Best Drama Serial at the 2006 British Academy Television Awards. Plot The lives of two young women collide in Victorian England when a group of thieves concoct an elaborate scam to defraud a young heiress of her inheritance. The story alternates between the twisting back alleyways of Dickensian London and the cloistered gloom of a Gothic mansion in 1862. =Part One= Since she was orphaned, Sue Trinder (Sally Hawkins) has been brought up amongst thieves and charlatans. She has been protected and cared for by Mrs Sucksby (Imelda Staunton) and taught to become a fingersmith (a pickpocket). But when Mrs Sucksby's old friend Richard Rivers (Rupert Evans), known as Gentleman, offers 20-year-old Sue ¬£2,000 to assist him in one of his scams, she cannot resist. Passing himself off as a proper gent, Rivers has befriended a young lady, Maud Lilly (Elaine Cassidy), who stands to inherit a fortune when she marries. However, Maud's maid has recently left her service and, without a chaperone, Rivers' access to Maud is limited. He wants Sue to be accepted as the new maid and to help him win Maud over. Once married, Rivers plans to have Maud committed to an asylum and he will then take her fortune for himself. Arriving at Briar, the estate where Maud lives with her wealthy bookish Uncle Lilly (Charles Dance), Sue enters another world. Maud and Sue are of a similar age and appearance but their experience of life couldn't be further apart. Maud's existence is one of wealth and prosperity inside a grand house, where she is her uncle's secretary and also has the duty of reading to her uncle and his friends. Over the course of a few months, Sue and Maud become friends and, briefly, lovers. Despite Sue's growing feelings for Maud, she is convinced to proceed with Rivers' scam. On Sue's advice, Maud accepts Rivers' proposal of marriage as a way of gaining her freedom from her uncle. Once married to Maud, Rivers' next plan is to get her admitted to the asylum. But in a dramatic twist, Sue is taken to the madhouse as \\"Mrs Rivers\\" and she realises that Maud has been in on the plan from the very beginning. =Part Two= Having disposed of Sue, Rivers takes Maud to London to Mrs Sucksby's house. There Maud learns that Mrs Sucksby is the mastermind behind her escape and Sue's downfall. Maud is plagued by doubts over her treatment of Sue and the fake life that she presented. In reality Maud was orphaned and brought up by her uncle, a cruel man, who hardened her heart. The nightly readings in his library were not as innocent as it appeared to Sue. Maud was forced to read pornography to her uncle and his friends. Tormented by the cruelty of her existence, Maud found in Rivers a way out. By marrying him, she could escape the prison of her uncle's house. But what Maud hadn't expected was to be so affected by her friendship with Sue ‚Äì or indeed that she would fall in love with her. In order to save herself from her uncle, Maud had to reconcile herself to hurting Sue. But even Maud couldn't have imagined that her world would be further turned upside down. Mrs Sucksby reveals that through a series of twists and turns Maud and Sue were switched at birth ‚Äì they have been living each other's lives. Mrs Sucksby arranged the whole scheme. Marianne Lilly, before being incarcerated in the asylum by her evil brother, changed her will, leaving one half of her wealth to her own daughter, Susan, and the other half to Maud. Mrs Sucksby explains to Maud that she has no choice but to comply with the rest of the plan. Maud is further devastated to learn that they have no intention of rescuing Sue from the asylum. Acknowledging the wrong she has done, Maud knows she must escape Mrs Sucksby if she is to rescue Sue. She manages to get out and finds her way to an old business associate of her uncle's, but he refuses to help and sends her away. Alone in the alleyways and streets of London and unaware of the dangers that lurk, Maud realises she has no choice but to return to Lant Street. Mrs Sucksby is overjoyed to see her and Maud discovers that she is in fact Mrs Sucksby's own daughter. Meanwhile, employing all the underhanded tricks that her childhood has taught her, Sue escapes from the asylum. She heads for London where she plans to get her revenge on Maud for what she sees as betrayal. At Mrs Sucksby's, Sue confronts Maud, Mrs Sucksby and Rivers; a huge row ensues and in a struggle Rivers is killed. Despite Maud being guilty of Rivers' murder, Mrs Sucksby confesses to protect both girls and soon after is executed for the crime. Maud disappears and Sue, realising that Maud was just an innocent in Mrs Sucksby's scheme, sets off to find her. Acknowledging their feelings for one another, the two women are reunited.

Great Encyclopedia of Colombia Jos√© Rafael de Pombo y Rebolledo (November 7, 1833 ‚Äì May 5, 1912) was a Colombian poet born in Bogot√°. Trained as a mathematician and an engineer in a military school, Rafael Pombo served in the army and he traveled to the United States of America as Secretary of the Legation in Washington. After completing his diplomatic assignment, he was hired by D. Appleton & Company in New York to translate into Spanish nursery rhymes from the Anglo-Saxon oral tradition. The product of this work, more than a translation, was a transformative adaptation published in two books under the titles Cuentos pintados para ni√±os and Cuentos morales para ni√±os formales. In spite of his extensive and diverse literary works, Rafael Pombo is mostly remembered for this contribution to children's literature. Among his most popular children's fables are Mich√≠n, Juan Chunguero, Pastorcita, La Pobre Viejecita, Sim√≥n el Bobito, El Gato Bandido, and El Renacuajo paseador. After seventeen years in the United States of America, Rafael Pombo returned to Colombia, where he worked as a celebrated translator and journalist (founding several newspapers). On August 20, 1905 he was crowned as Colombia's best poet - his Poes√≠as Completas was published in 1957, from which the poem El Ni√°gara was taken.

It was produced by Rob Schnapf, who had previously produced records by Elliott Smith, of whom Kevin is an avid fan. In regards to the album's political and social themes, Kevin said that \\"I was always very abstractly political. I listened to punk rock records and thought I could punch my time card.

In late 2007, Kevin had hinted at a re-release of the album with the aid of Brand New's record label, Procrastinate! Music Traitors and was officially released on April 20, 2008. Both physical and digital versions of the album are available. Kevin stated \\"Capitol was cool enough to give us the record back with minimal hassle, which I'm real grateful for\\".

On the second floor, King Frederik William III would give tea parties, sometimes gathering up to 40 persons. Interior furnishings of the royal rooms affected extreme simplicity. Only a samovar from Tula and table and tea services produced by the Berlin royal porcelain manufactory specified the high position of the dweller. A porcelain service, gift of the Russian emperor Nicholas I, was decorated with painted gold on a malachite background, and scenes of rural life.

The area is located within Libertyville Township. As Rondout is an unincorporated community rather than a municipality, it lacks clearly defined borders, and shares postal codes with Lake Bluff, Lake Forest and Libertyville, Illinois. It has its own elementary school which comes under Rondout School District 72. Illinois Route 176 passes east‚Äìwest through Rondout, serving as the \\"main street\\" of the community, where it is also called \\"Rockland Road\\". History =Rondout Community= Between 1870 and 1872, the Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad (later the Milwaukee Road; since 1985 the Canadian Pacific Railway - CPR) completed a railroad line between Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1880, a branch line was built to Libertyville, Illinois, and the new junction was known as Libertyville Junction. People referred to the community around the junction as Sulfur Glen, due to the high amounts of sulphur in the water nearby. In 1888, the community was renamed Rondout, after Rondout, New York. One account has the community renaming itself in an unsuccessful attempt to attract a business from the aforementioned town in New York. Another has a Sulfur Glen resident asking the railroad to rename the community after his former hometown. In 1951, Peter Baker & Son Co. moved their asphalt plant from Lake Forest to Rondout, contributing to the development of the area. =History of Rondout and Railroads= As noted above, the initial north-south and northwest three- way railroad junction was built in 1880 by a predecessor of the CPR, which still operates it. In 1889, another railroad line was built that crossed the Milwaukee & St. Paul/CPR northeast-southwest at grade, just south of the first Rondout junction point. This new 1889 line was built by the Waukegan and Southwestern Railway, then acquired shortly thereafter by the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway, which was in turn acquired in 2009 by the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The crossing and the freight interchange connecting the CNR newer line to what is now the CPR still exist as of 2017. This new 1889 crossing necessitated the construction of an interlocking tower southeast of the expanded junction. Then, in 1902, the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railway's branch to Mundelein was built, parallel to Rockland Road and passing over the EJ&E; and Milwaukee Road above grade, almost directly above the existing Rondout junction. In 1916, Samuel Insull purchased and reorganized the Chicago & Milwaukee as the Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee, often called the North Shore Line. The North Shore Line's freight interchange with the Milwaukee Road, and its above-grade Rondout Station passenger platforms and shelters, survived until the entire North Shore Line went out of business in January, 1963. In the first decade of the 20th century, Rondout junction's original grade-level interlocking tower was replaced by a brick structure. By 2013, it was one of the few remaining railroad interlocking towers in Illinois. In early 2015, it was reported to have been closed and slated for demolition. On June 12, 1924, Rondout was the site of the largest train robbery in United States history. Several outlaws, including the \\"Newton Gang\\" and a corrupt postal inspector, targeted Milwaukee Road's Fast Mail train and successfully carried out a robbery of more than $2 million of cash, jewelry and securities. All of the conspirators were caught and prosecuted shortly afterwards, all but $100,000 of the stolen goods were recovered, and a historical marker was built to commemorate the event. commuter trains still pass through Rondout on the Milwaukee District / North Line, and they formerly stopped there at the main Rondout Station located on Rockland Road, just south of the junction's split between the Libertyville/Fox Lake, Illinois, branch and the Chicago-Milwaukee main line at the diamond with the EJ&E.; The station house was removed on January 1, 1979, but Regional Transportation Authority/Metra commuter trains continued stopping at Rondout station until November 22, 1984. The station platforms and signage remained for a time. Most of the platform was demolished in 1997, and access to the remaining platform was officially restricted on January 1, 2002. =Rondout's Railroads Today= Metra's Milwaukee District / North Line commuter trains, between Chicago and Fox Lake, Illinois, via Lake Forest and Libertyville, continue to pass through Rondout junction to the present day (2017). So do Amtrak's Hiawatha Service and Empire Builder intercity passenger trains, using the Chicago-Milwaukee, Wisconsin, main line. At the Rondout railroad junction today (2017), just south of Rt. 176/Rockland Road, the CNR's single-track Waukegan Subdivision (operated by CNR's Wisconsin Central subsidiary) still crosses the north-south C&M; (rail) Subdivision. The Union Pacific Railroad has trackage rights on the Waukegan Subdivision. The Fox Lake (rail) Subdivision still branches off to the northwest, through Libertyville. Metra now owns the Fox Lake Subdivision and the portion of the C&M; Subdivision from Rondout south, while the CPR still owns the north portion, and the CPR's Soo Line dispatches all of both subdivisions. Railroads that have trackage rights over various parts of the two subdivisions include Amtrak, the CPR, the Indiana Rail Road, Metra and the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad. The former North Shore Line's Mundelein branch is now (2017) the North Shore Bike Path, paralleling Rockland Road and still elevated over Rondout junction. Education Rondout School Rondout is served by Rondout School District 72, consisting of a lone elementary school, Rondout School. The school provides education from Kindergarten through Eighth Grade to students living in Rondout and several adjacent communities. Graduates of Rondout School attend Libertyville High School.

Cyberterrorism and cybersecurity  Several aspects of cyberterrorism are dealt with in title VIII. Under section 814 of the Patriot Act, it is clarified that punishments apply to those who either damage or gain unauthorized access to a protected computer and thus cause a person an aggregate loss greater than $5,000; adversely affects someone's medical examination, diagnosis or treatment; causes a person to be injured; causes a threat to public health or safety; or causes damage to a governmental computer that is used as a tool to administer justice, national defense, or national security.Clarification was made through an amendment to , which deals with fraud and related activity in connection with computers.

Section 816 specifies the development and support of cybersecurity forensic capabilities. It directs the Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories that have the capability of performing forensic examinations of intercepted computer evidence relating to criminal activity and cyberterrorism, and that have the capability of training and educating Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors in computer crime, and to \\"facilitate and promote the sharing of Federal law enforcement expertise and information about the investigation, analysis, and prosecution of computer-related crime with State and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, including the use of multijurisdictional task forces\\".

Geography Bovisio Masciago is located in the Po Valley, the foothills of the nearby hills of Brianza. It is a few kilometers from Milan (easily accessible thanks to the Northern Railways of Milan), Como, Saronno and Monza. The city is crossed from north to south by the River Seveso. Bovisio is one of the 16 municipalities of the Park and one of three common Groane Oasis LIPU (Italian League for Bird Protection) of Cesano Maderno. History =Name= Bovisio Masciago arose in 1928, when the king of Italy Victor Emmanuel III, after consulting Italian Minister of the Interior Benito Mussolini, fused Bovisio and Masciago Milanese. The village was called \\"Bovisio\\", but people of Masciago protested; so, in 1947, the municipality was called Bovisio Masciago. =Bovisio= The name Bovisio should come from the Latin bovis otium and would like to show that in this place the Roman army took the supplies and animals. The confirmation of the Roman origins of Bovisio occurred in 1935 when it was discovered in its territory, a Gallo-Roman tomb containing various household items. =Masciago= The name of Masciago also has Latin origin and should be derived from Martis ager (Field of Mars) and would indicate that the location, the Roman era, had been a military camp. Economy Formerly the main economic activity was agricultural, with many of the families engaged in the silkworm. Since the 19th century the industrial sector gradually developed. One of the most important industries in Bovisio was that of the Zari family, whose activities started in 1867. The company produced wooden floors and furniture and sewing machines. During World War I, Zari turned into a war industry producing wooden casings for aircraft. Other industries present at Bovisio included: * Golden Auction Limited Company * L.I.G.A. (Italian Rubber Processing and Related) * S.A.R.A. (Anonymous Society of Bovisio Weaving) * Cork Marangoni & C. (founded in 1882, was one of the largest cork in Europe) * Furnace Solcia. Currently none of these industries is active. The furnace and many of the old warehouses have been demolished. Some sheds still house small artisan firms, but there are plans to redevelop their total demolition of the old town.

His career was virtually over by the time detailed scorecards began to be kept in the 1772 English cricket season and so little is known about his personal history.

They were known for introducing Post-Impressionist styles into Hungary, in addition to Fauvism, Cubism and Expressionism. Biography B√©la Cz√≥bel was born to a Jewish-Hungarian family in Budapest in 1883.Adrian M. Darmon, Autour de l'art juif: Encyclop√©die des peintres, photographes et sculpteurs, Paris: Carnot, 2003, p. 50, accessed 1 February 2013 He became a student of B√©la Iv√°nyi- Gr√ºnwald in the Nagyb√°nya free school, held in an artists' colony in what is now Baia Mare, Romania. In 1902, he went to Munich to study, where he became friends with Jules Pascin, Rudolf Levy and Walter Bondy. In 1904, like many other young artists from Hungary, he went to Paris for additional study; he attended the Acad√©mie Julian as a pupil of Jean Paul Laurens. His style at first reflected the principles of naturalism of the Nagyb√°nya school. After meeting painters of the Fauves group in 1905 in Paris and seeing their work at the influential Salon d'Automne exhibit that year, he began to incorporate strong colors into his works. B√©la Cz√≥bel, Portrait de Femme, c. 1908-09. Reproduced in Gelett Burgess, The Wild Men of Paris, Architectural Record, May 1910 Returning to Budapest, Cz√≥bel joined other young painters first known as the \\"Neos\\", for striking out in directions different from the Nagyb√°nya traditions. By 1909 they organized as The Eight. They had their first exhibit, New Pictures, that year, their first as The Eight in 1911.

It was established December 9, 1866 unifying the suppressed municipalities of Baraggia, San Damiano and Moncucco (which nowadays are frazioni of Brugherio), together with the villages of Bindellera, Cesena, Gelosa, San Paolo, Torazza, Occhiate and Increa. Brugherio borders the following municipalities: Monza, Agrate Brianza, Carugate, Sesto San Giovanni, Cologno Monzese, Cernusco sul Naviglio. Brugherio received the title of city with a presidential decree on January 27, 1967. Etymology The name Brugherio is said to derive from Il Brugo which is Italian for Common Heather. This plant is common on the clay- type soil in the region and it features on the town's coat-of-arms.A Province to Be Explored: Monza, Section on Brugherio, Retrieved 12 August 2015  History  = Origins and Middle Ages = The first written memory of Brugherio dates back to the Roman Empire when Noxiate, Sanctus Damianus, Baragia and Octavum were designated as the first settlements in the territory. Noxiate corresponded to the current town center (where the parish church of Saint Bartholomew is now located), then split, during the Carolingian period, between Monza and Cologno Monzese. Baragia stretched north, including Sanctus Damianus, and south, where there is the present city center. Octavum corresponded to the current San Cristoforo and it was located at mile No. 8 of the Roman road leading from Milan to Monza. An 853 document recorded the presence of \\"a hospice or a hospital for pilgrims ...\\". Cascina Sant'Ambrogio (former monastery of Benedictine nuns) During the fourth century, the current Via dei Mille was a portion of Via Burdigalense and this area belonged to Ambrose, Bishop of Milan. This land was occupied by a monastery of the Benedictine nuns in 1098. Ambrose donated the property, and the convent which was there established, to his sister Marcellina, who had chosen to retire to contemplative life. Between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, the monastery and its territories went to other religious orders (including Humiliatis). Up to 1362 it was still nuns who kept the administration of land assets after the transfer in the monastery of Saint Bartolo in Rancate. The fourteenth century saw the political struggles between Torriani and Visconti for the domain of Milan and the cities under its government. Such strife were also felt in Brugherio: in 1282 it is said that in Octavum rose a castrum which was contended between the two families. Up to these events, the current municipal area was already divided in three parishes: the current historic center and Moncucco belonged to Monza; Baraggia that was part of Vimercate and Increa that was under Gorgonzola's authority. = 16th and 17th centuries = During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Brugherio suffered anarchy due to the wars between the French and the Spanish, endured the economic crisis that characterized the Spanish Lombardy at that time and was afflicted by repeated episodes of plague: the worsts were the one called \\"the plague of Saint Charles\\" (1576-1577) and one called the \\"plague of Manzoni\\" (1630), because it was described by Alessandro Manzoni in The Betrothed. In the sixteenth century the territory of the town was split: a portion with Monza, another with Vimercate and many other local farmhouses. Despite the years of decline, it was in 1578 that Brugherio found its first communal identity, when Saint Charles Borromeo established the parish of St. Bartholomew, unifying beneath the church the territories that were politically divided. = 18th century = The eighteenth century brought big political changes in Lombardy: in 1714, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession (1700-1714), the Italian territories, belonging to Spain, went to the Austrian Habsburgs, who took back order in administration and wise economic measures. The Enlightenment, the social reforms and the government of Maria Theresa (1740-1780) led to prosperity, stimulating the development of handicraft and farming. Common cultivations were vines and mulberry trees, that were used to feed the silk worms, which were given by the owner to the tenant farmers. Mostly women and children worked on the breeding of silkworms. Where the ancient castra stood, Milanese families built their summer residences: since 1600, Brugherio was a very appreciated holiday destination by local aristocrats. In this way the main villas in the area were constructed: Villa Fiorita, Palazzo Ghirlanda-Silva, Villa Sormani are just a few examples. It was precisely in the Villa Sormani where one of the most important events of the century took place: Count Paolo Andreani demonstrated the first public balloon flight on Italian soil, in 1784. Monument celebrating the first Italian public balloon ascent by Paolo Andreani in 1784 = 19th century = After the brief Napoleonic season in Italy, the coalition forces of Austria, Prussia, Russia and Great Britain succeeded to overthrow the Emperor of the French and to begin, following the Congress of Vienna, the period of Restoration. Lombardy, along with Veneto, were united in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, part of the Austrian Empire. In 1816, landowners of Brugherio tried to merge their own territories into a single municipality, but the project failed due to the resistance of the Austrian bureaucrats of Milan, who did not want to waste time in unifying such a fragmented land. During the same years, Gian Mario Andreani (brother of Paolo Andreani) and the architect Giocondo Albertolli succeeded in a memorable enterprise: they moved the Anthony of Padua's chapel built in Lugano, Switzerland, to Villa Sormani. In order to transport the chapel from Lugano to Moncucco, Albertolli first disassembled it, then he rebuilt it near count Gian Mario's villa. After it had been dismantled, he had the pieces shipped over Lake Lugano and then transported by land to Como. The pieces travelled over ten kilometers through the Naviglio Martesana arriving at the river port of Mattalino Bridge, where they were unloaded near Count Andreani's property. The work took from 1815‚Äì16 until after 1832. Anthony of Padua's chapel acquired then its new designation, becoming the little church dedicated to Saint Lucius (the so-called \\"little temple of Moncucco\\"). December 9, 1866 it was established the new municipality of Brugherio unifying Cassina Baraggia, San Damiano, Bindellera, Cesena, Gelosa, San Paolo, Torazza, Occhiate and Increa. The first mayor was the former one of Cassina Baraggia, Giovanni Noseda. The territory of Moncucco was added to the new municipality in 1871. The years that went from 1866 to 1900 were quite drowsy. The municipality was run by a small class of landowners, who maintained relations with the local farmers that did not differ much from the feudal bonds. Nevertheless, Brugherio saw in 1880 the inauguration of the tramway Cascina Gobba-Vimercate, in 1886 the opening of Canale Villoresi and, in recent decades, the birth of the first factories for the production of silk. = 20th century = Despite the slight industrialization, in this area it took birth the first trade union movements of Catholic inspiration. In fact the countryside, strongly linked to religion, was hostile to the socialist revendications and approached the Catholic- inspired unions, causing a change of relationship between farmers and landowners. In 1912, with the proclamation of universal male suffrage, by Giovanni Giolitti, the electoral base expanded greatly and it changed the political forces that were under the oligarchy. The years of World War I were administrated by mayor Giovanni Santini and Brugherio was always stocked with food supplies, while in the period of the so-called Biennio Rosso (1919-1920) took place violence between the Socialists and the Popular Catholics. The latter lost their absolute majority, due to the loosening of their trade union activities, and the last mayor elected at the polls, Marcello Gatti, had to manage the difficult transition from Liberalism to Fascism. From 1926 to 1943 the town was ruled by the podest√† Ercole Balconi. With the fall of Mussolini, Brugherio was the scene of the trade union movements of workers at the Pirelli plant in San Damiano and of resistance movement against the Nazism: this is why a street is named after the last Partisan murdered in town, Luigi Teruzzi. Villa Fiorita After 1946, Brugherio was ruled by the newly formed Christian Democracy. Under the governments of Pollastri, Meli and Giltri, Brugherio radically changed the features of its territory: new industrial villages were edified by Falck and Pirelli; social housing and new schools were built; the public library was founded in 1960 and it was placed within Palazzo Ghirlanda-Silva; sewerage, electricity and natural gas were extended on the whole area. In those years Brugherio turned into an industrial town (the presence of the Candy company was very important) and it was crowned with the title of city on 27 January 1967, by President of the Republic Giuseppe Saragat. Between the sixties and the eighties Silvio Berlusconi edified Edilnord district; the municipality bought Villa Fiorita (former nursing home for nervous disease, where the painter Filippo De Pisis had spent several years), to establish its headquarters there; middle school \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" was built and the residential area of Quartiere Ovest (West District) was created. In fact, during the economic boom, many southern people emigrated to the outskirts of big industrial cities and the number of inhabitants increased significantly. In 1993 it was built the church of San Carlo, in the West district, far from the parish church of Saint Bartholomew. Between 1992 and 1994 the municipality purchased and restored the little but important church of Saint Lucius.

This is a still from the Smithsonian Institution's Exploring Hidden Mexico (1943). Matthew Williams Stirling (August 28, 1896 - January 23, 1975) was an American ethnologist, archaeologist and later an administrator at several scientific institutions in the field. He is best known for his discoveries relating to the Olmec civilization. Much of his work was done with his \\"wife and constant collaborator\\" of 42 years Marion Stirling (nee Illig, later Pugh). Stirling began his career with extensive ethnological work in the United States, New Guinea and Ecuador, before directing his attention to the Olmec civilization and its possible primacy among the pre-Columbian societies of Mesoamerica. His discovery of, and excavations at, various sites attributed to Olmec culture in the Mexican Gulf Coast region significantly contributed towards a better understanding of the Olmecs and their culture. He then began investigating links between the different civilizations in the region. Apart from his extensive field work and publications, later in his career Stirling proved to be an able administrator of academic and research bodies, who served on directorship boards of a number of scientific organizations. Early life and work Marion and Matthew Stirling in Veracruz, Mexico, April 15, 1939 Matthew was born in Salinas, California, where his father managed the Southern Pacific Milling Company. Most of his childhood days were spent on his grandfather's ranch where he first developed an interest in antiquity, collecting arrowheads and researching artefacts. Stirling majored in anthropology under Alfred L. Kroeber, graduating from the University of California in 1920. His interest in the Olmecs began in about 1918, when he saw a picture of a \\"crying-baby\\" blue jade masquette, published by Thomas Wilson of the Smithsonian Institution in 1898. When he traveled to Europe with his family after graduation, he found the masquette itself in the Berlin Museum, and intrigued by the Olmec culture, took time to look at other specimens in the Maximilian Collection in Vienna, and later, in Madrid. Stirling was a teaching fellow at the University of California during 1920‚Äì21. He then joined the Smithsonian Institution, as a museum aide and assistant curator in its Division of Ethnology at the National Museum. He worked there until 1925. He located several more Olmec pieces in the museum. During this period, he also obtained his master's degree in Anthropology from the George Washington University. He was later, in 1943, to receive a Doctorate in Science from Tampa University. He excavated on Weedon Island for the Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE) in 1923‚Äì24, and at Arikara villages in Mobridge, South Dakota, during the summer of 1924. Stirling resigned from the Smithsonian to lead a 400-member, Smithsonian Institution- Dutch Colonial Government, expedition to New Guinea in 1925. He conducted ethnological and physical anthropological studies among the indigenous peoples there, and collected a number of natural history specimens, which now form one of the most valuable collections in the National Museum. He returned to take over as chief of the Smithsonian's Bureau of American Ethnology in 1928. He retained the position until 1957, his title changing to director in 1947. He went to Ecuador in 1931‚Äì32, conducting ethnological studies of the J√≠varo, as part of Donald C. Beatty's expedition. He also worked along the Gulf Coast, directing archaeological digs in Florida and Georgia. Olmec Head excavated in La Venta In 1931, he met Marion Illig (1911‚Äì2001), who took a job as his secretary. They married on December 11, 1933 and worked together for the next forty-two years, until his death. She accompanied him on all but one of his subsequent archaeological expeditions. They had a son and a daughter. Matthew Stirling wrote that Marion was his \\"co-explorer, co-author and general co- ordinator.\\" Stirling was intrigued by Marshall Saville's two 1929 reports, Votive Axes from Ancient Mexico. Subsequent discussions with Saville launched Stirling into a phase of his career which would be focused on what was then beginning to be called Olmec culture. The Olmec The Olmec were an ancient Pre-Columbian people living in south-central Mexico, in the modern-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco, from about 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. They are claimed by many to be the mother culture of every primary element common to later Mesoamerican civilizations. The name \\"Olmec\\" means \\"rubber people\\" in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. It was the Aztec name for the people who lived in this area at the time of Aztec dominance, referring to them as those who supplied the rubber balls used for games. Early modern explorers applied the name \\"Olmec\\" to ruins and art from this area before it was understood that these had been already abandoned more than a thousand years before the time of the people the Aztecs knew as the \\"Olmec\\". Stirling and history of the Olmecs By 1929, Stirling had begun suspecting that the artifacts emerging out of Mexico belonged to a time much earlier than attributed to the Olmecs. From the BAE, he directed excavations in fringes of the area thought to be Maya. Matthew and Marion Stirling first visited Tres Zapotes in 1938. They travelled to the western margin and concentrated on the Tres Zapotes site. He noted the position of the colossal head ‚Äì surrounded by four mounds ‚Äì and the presence of a vast mound group in the area. He interested the National Geographic Society enough to be granted funds for excavation. This began a sixteen-year association with the site. The back of Stela C at Tres Zapotes The bars and circles show the Maya-style long-count date of 7.16.6.16.18. The glyphs surrounding the date are what is thought to be one of the few surviving examples of Epi-Olmec script. During excavations there in 1939, they discovered Stela C. The top half of the monument was missing but the bottom half produced a Long Count date of ?.16.6.16.18. If the first digit was a \\"7\\" then the date would correlate to 32 BCE, a date considered by many to be too early for a Mesoamerican civilization. An \\"8\\" would mean a date of 363 CE. The Stirlings opted for the earlier date, to the consternation of many in the archaeological community. They were proven correct in 1970, when the top half of Stela C was discovered, and the earlier date of 7.16.6.16.18, or 32 BCE, was confirmed. He also led the first of several expeditions to San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n (1938), La Venta (1939‚Äì40) and Cerro de las Mesas (1940‚Äì41). In 1941, Stirling unearthed a large carved stone monument in Izapa, which he labeled Stela 5. Stirling was unable to return to La Venta until 1942, due to World War II. When he did, he was to excavate several important artifacts. He then left for Tuxtla Guti√©rrez to attend a conference on the Maya and Olmec cultures, one that was to become a defining moment in modern ideas about the Olmec. It was here that Miguel Covarrubias and Dr. Alfonso Caso first presented the case for the Olmec culture as being the \\"mother culture\\" of Mesoamerica, pre-dating even the Maya. Stirling supported their hypothesis, as he did Covarrubias in his interpretation of Olmec art. For example, Monument 1 at R√≠o Chiquito and Monument 3 at Potrero Nuevo were, according to Stirling, the mythological union of a jaguar and a woman that produced \\"almost jaguar children\\". It would be nearly 15 years before radiocarbon dating finally confirmed that the Olmec pre-dated the Maya. The Olmec culture is generally considered to have lasted from 1400 BCE until 400 BCE. Other work Stirling began searching for links between Mesoamerican and South American cultures in Panama, Ecuador, and Costa Rica from 1948 to 1954. He was also the chief organizer of the seven-volume Handbook of South American Indians. He conducted excavations in the Linea Vieja lowlands of Costa Rica in the 1960s. Concentrating on tombs, he dug at five sites between Siquirres and Guapiles, and published a series of C- 14 dates ranging from 1440 to 1470 CE, and arranged much of the pottery excavated in an approximate chronological sequence. In the Sierra de Ameca between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, Jalisco, a large number of stone spheres, many of which are almost perfectly spherical, can be found. Their generally spherical shape led people to suspect they were manmade stone balls, called petrospheres, created by an unknown culture. In 1967, Stirling examined these stone spheres in the field. As a result of this examination, he and his colleagues hypothesized that they were of geological origin. A later expedition and subsequent petrographic and other laboratory analyses of samples of the stone balls confirmed this suspicion. Their interpretation of the data collected in both field and laboratory is that these stone balls were formed by high temperature nucleation of glassy material within an ashfall tuff, as a result of tertiary volcanism.Stirling, M.W., 1969, An Occurrence of Great Stone Spheres in Jalisco State, Mexico. National Geographic Research Reports. v. 7, pp. 283‚Äì286. Other positions held Stirling was president of the Anthropological Society of Washington in 1934‚Äì1935 and vice president of the American Anthropological Association in 1935‚Äì36. He received the National Geographic Society's Franklyn L. Burr Award for meritorious service in 1939, 1941 (shared with his wife Marion) and 1958. He was also on the Ethnographic Board, which was the Smithsonian's effort to make its scientific research available to the military agencies during World War II. After his retirement, Stirling was a Smithsonian research associate, a National Park Service collaborator, and member of the National Geographic Committee on Research and Exploration. Stirling died in 1975, aged 78, after a period of illness associated with cancer. Book collection Marion Stirling donated around 5000 volumes from the Stirlings' library to the Boundary End Archaeology Research Center (earlier the Center for Maya Research). They include a collection of scholarly pamphlets and reprints from the mid-19th century on, complete runs of the American Anthropologist (1881‚Äì ); American Antiquity (1935‚Äì ), Bulletins 1‚Äì200 and Annual Reports 1‚Äì48 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and all the Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History.

His age is disputed and some records suggest he was born in 1859, not 1848. Biography Lundy memorial at Confederate Park, in Crestview (now moved 4.6 miles / 7.4 km north to the community of Auburn). William Lundy was allegedly born near Troy, in Pike County, Alabama, on January 18, 1848 (also reported at Coffee Springs, Coffee County). He is said to have enlisted in the last days of March 1864, at age 16; Company D (Brown's), 4th Alabama Cavalry Regiment (Home Guard) at Elba; and to have been honorably discharged at Elba in May 1865, on account of close of war. He moved his family to Laurel Hill in 1890, where he and his wife, Mary Jane Lassiter, raised ten children. He was granted a Confederate soldier's pension in Florida, no. 8948, of $600 per annum to be paid effective from June 12, 1941. At some point the pension increased to $75 per month ($900 per annum), and finally, in 1953, it was increased to $150 per month ($1800 per annum).Florida Pension Records On January 18, 1955, the Boston Traveler published an article, \\"Reb on T.V.\\", of which William Allen Lundy was the subject; making mention of the 107-year-old Confederate veteran being on television in Pensacola. By a Joint Resolution of Congress of July 18, 1956, a gold medal was authorized to be struck and presented to the only four surviving Civil War veterans: one Union veteran and three Confederate veterans. The Union soldier, Albert Woolson, died before the medals could be presented. Age dispute He claimed to be the last surviving Confederate soldier residing in Florida, and one of three (all Confederate) Civil War veterans still alive at the time in the United States. At the alleged age of 109, Lundy died in Crestview, Okaloosa County, on September 1, 1957. He is interred at Almarante Cemetery, Laurel Hill. However, 1860 Census records suggest that Lundy was born in 1859, which would mean that he was only six years old at the end of the Civil War‚Äîimplying that he could never have fought in it‚Äîand 98 when he died.1860 Census record for William Lundy In addition, research in 2016 suggested that no evidence in favor of either Lundy or his father having served could be found.

Most cheilitis is caused by acute sun exposure. Allergic tests may identify allergens that cause cheilitis. Chapped lips Photographic Comparison of: 1) a Canker sore - inside the mouth, 2) Herpes, 3) Angular cheilitis and 4) Chapped lips.Dorfman J, The Center for Special Dentistry . Chapped lips (also cheilitis simplex or common cheilitis) are characterized by cracking of the lips.Lower lips usually gets inflammed. There may also be burning or the formation of large, painful cracks when the lips are stretched. Chronic cheilitis simplex can progress to crusting and bleeding. Lip licker's dermatitis, popularly known as perioral dermatitis, in a young male with a lip-licking habit. Note also deep fissures on lips. Counterintuitively, constant licking of the lips causes drying and irritation, and eventually the mucosa splits or cracks. The lips have a greater tendency to dry out in cold, dry weather. Digestive enzymes present in saliva may also irritate the lips, and the evaporation of the water in saliva saps moisture from them. Erythema extending onto the perioral skin. Some children have a habit of sucking and chewing on the lower lip, producing a combination of cheilitis and sharply demarcated perioral erythema (redness). Treatment is usually successful with the use of topical medications Medical grade (USP) lanolin accelerates repair of the lips,\\"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology\\", Volume 56, Issue 2, Pages AB94 ‚Äì AB94 Sometimes the term \\"cheilitis simplex\\" is used as a synonym for cheilitis generally, however, exfoliative cheilitis (discussed later) is also sometimes stated to be the equivalent of chapped lips. Actinic cheilitis Mainly caused due to sun rays and affects white peoples having low skin tone. There is a small risk that this condition can develop into squamous cell carcinoma in the long term, but lip cancer is usually noticed early and hence has a good prognosis compared to oral cancer generally. Angular cheilitis Angular cheilitis- inflammation of the corner of the mouth. Angular cheilitis causes inflammation of angles of the mouth. There are many possible causes, including malnourishment,deficiencies(iron, B vitamins, folate), contact allergy, infection (Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus or Œ≤-hemolytic streptococci) and edentulism (often with overclosure of the mouth and concomitant denture-related stomatitis), and others. Eczematous cheilitis Also termed \\"lip dermatitis\\", eczematous cheilitis is a diverse group of disorders which often have an unknown cause. Chronic eczematous reactions account for the majority of chronic cheilitis cases. It is divided into endogenous (due to an inherent characteristic of the individual), and exogenous (where it is caused by an external agent). The main cause of endogenous eczematous cheilitis is atopic cheilitis (atopic dermatitis), and the main causes of exogenous eczematous cheilitis is irritant contact cheilitis (e.g., caused by a lip-licking habit) and allergic contact cheilitis. The latter is characterized by a dryness, fissuring, edema, and crusting. It affects females more commonly than males, in a ratio of about 9:1. Patch test The most common causes of allergic contact cheilitis is lip cosmetics, including lipsticks and lip balm, followed by toothpastes. A lipstick allergy can be difficult to diagnose in some cases as it is possible that cheilitis can develop without the person even wearing lipstick. Instead, small exposure such as kissing someone who is wearing lipstick is enough to cause the condition. Allergy to Balsam of Peru can manifest as cheilitis.\\"Balsam of Peru induced contact allergy\\" DermatitisFacts.com. Date of publication: Unknown. Accessed: October 11, 2007 Allergies to metal, wood, or other components can cause cheilitis reactions in musicians, especially players of woodwind and brass instruments, e.g., the so-called \\"clarinetist's cheilitis\\", or \\"flutist's cheilitis\\". \\"Pigmented contact cheilitis\\" is one type of allergic cheilitis in which a brown-black discoloration of the lips develops. Patch testing is used to identify the substance triggering allergic contact cheilitis. Infectious cheilitis Infectious cheilitis refers to cheilitis caused by infectious disease. The terms \\"Candidal cheilitis\\" and \\"bacterial cheilitis\\" are sometimes used, denoting the involvement of Candida organisms and bacterial species respectively. The term \\"cheilocandidiasis\\" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. Impetigo (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and/or Staphylococcus aureus), can manifest as an exfoliative cheilitis-like appearance. Herpes labialis (cold sore) is a common cause of infectious cheilitis. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth, and be mistaken for other causes of angular cheilitis. In fact this is herpes labialis, and is sometimes termed \\"angular herpes simplex\\". Granulomatous cheilitis Orofacial granulomatosis is enlargement of lips due to the granulomatous inflammation. \\"Median cheilitis\\" may be seen, which is fissuring in the midline of the lips due to the enlargement of the lips. Angular cheilitis may also be associated with orofacial granulomatosis. A related condition is Melkersson‚ÄìRosenthal syndrome, a triad of facial palsy, chronic lip edema, and fissured tongue. \\"Miescher‚Äôs cheilitis\\", and \\"granulomatous macrocheilitis\\", are synonyms of granulomatous cheilitis. Drug-related cheilitis Common causes of drug-related cheilitis include Etretinate, Indinavir, Protease inhibitors, Vitamin A and Isotretinoin (a retinoid drug). Uncommon causes include Atorvastatin, Busulphan, Clofazimine, Clomipramine, Cyancobalamin, Gold, Methyldopa, Psoralens, Streptomycin, Sulfasalazine and Tetracycline.When administration of these drugs are stopped condition gets normalized.[33] Exfoliative cheilitis Also termed \\"cheilitis exfoliativa\\" or \\"tic de levres\\", is an uncommon inflammatory condition of the lips, which are painful and crusted.There is formation of white thin crust over the lips which form and shed continuously. Although there may be associated erythema and edema. The condition has not yet been attributed to any particular cause. Rarely are infections to blame. In some individuals, there is an association with stress, anxiety, depression or personality disorders. In one report, 87% of individuals had some form of psychiatric disturbance, and 47% had thyroid dysfunction, which in turn can cause psychiatric conditions like depression. Some cases of exfoliative cheilitis are thought to represent factitious damage, termed \\"factitious cheilitis\\" or \\"artifactual cheilitis\\", and are related to repetitive lip picking or licking habits. This appears as crusting and ulceration caused by repetitive chewing and sucking of the lips. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic. This habit is sometimes termed perl√®che (derived from the French word pourl√®cher meaning \\"to lick one‚Äôs lips\\"). Factitious cheilitis is significantly more common in young females. Exfoliative cheilitis has also been linked to HIV/AIDS. Management consists mostly of keeping the lips moist and the application of topical corticosteroids ranging from hydrocortisone to clobetasol. There have also been reports of using topical tacrolimus ointment. Cheilitis glandularis This is an inflammatory condition of the minor salivary glands, usually in the lower lip, which appears swollen and everted. There may also be ulceration, crusting, abscesses, and sinus tracts. It is an acquired disorder, but the cause is uncertain.Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, Volume 54, Issue 2, Pages 336‚Äì337 P. Carrington, T. Horn Suspected causes include sunlight, tobacco, syphilis, poor oral hygiene and genetic factors. The openings of the minor salivary gland ducts become inflamed and dilated, and there may be mucopurulent discharge from the ducts. A previous classification suggested dividing cheilitis into 3 types based on severity, with the later stages involving secondary infection with bacteria, and increased ulceration, suppuration and swelling: Type 1, Simple; Type 2, Superficial suppurative (\\"Baelz's disease\\"); and Type 3, Deep suppurative (\\"cheilitis glandularis epostemetosa\\"). Cheilitis glandularis usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly males, and it carries a risk of malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma (18% to 35%). Preventative treatment such as vermilionectomy (\\"lip shave\\") is therefore the treatment of choice. Plasma cell cheilitis Plasma cell cheilitis appears as well defined, infiltrated, dark red plaque with a superficial lacquer-like glazing. Plasma cell cheilitis usually involves the lower lip. The lips appear dry, atrophic and fissured. Angular cheilitis is sometimes also present. Other causes * Lupus erythematosus, sometimes termed \\"lupus cheilitis\\". * Crohn's disease (angular cheilitis). * \\"Nutritional cheilitis\\", e.g. pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. * Lichen planus. * Pemphigoid. * Xerostomia.

History The first mention of the village of Busto Garolfo is in a 992 AD document. At the end of the 13th century there were three altars in honor of Saints Bartholomew, Innocent and Margaret, in the ancient church of San Salvatore, which had been built by the aristocratic della Croce family which had owned land in the area since 1317. In 1464, Stefano Della Croce in his will ordered his heirs to build a chapel in honor of the Virgin in the main church of San Salvatore. During the Late Middle Ages, Busto Garolfo became a feud first of the Maggi family, then of the Arconati family and later, of the Losetti family. In 1664, Giambattista Losetti sold the town to Giuseppe Arconati, to whom the King of Spain conferred the title of Marquess of Busto Garolfo. After more than a century of Austrian domination, the town became involved in the events of the Italian Wars of Independence. Italian and the Austrian armies, often transited here, including during the Battle of Magenta in 1859. Geography Busto Garolfo is located in the higher Po Valley. This area is called \\"Alto-Milanese\\" because of its location in the territory between the provinces of Milan and Varese. The town has got only one suburb named Olcella and located toward the north-western border. The Villoresi channel flows through the village. The lack of a nearby river required his construction, ended in 1890, to irrigate the corn fields in the area. Historically in the centre of the town there were two great weaving companies, now demolished to make way for some apartment buildings. In the post-war period the industrial area has spread to the east, in which there is a variety of small and medium-sized companies.

According to the book The Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film and Television 1928-1992 by Burl Barer, Martin sent her manuscript to Leslie Charteris as a present in 1979. On its own, this would qualify the novel as no more than fan fiction. However Charteris, who at the time was editing a series of continuation books featuring The Saint (he had stopped writing the character full-time in 1963) was impressed enough by the manuscript to offer it to the British publishers of the Saint series, Hodder & Stoughton, for publication as the next book in the series. Barer writes that Hodder & Stoughton rejected the manuscript, apparently on the grounds that Martin had made Templar sound too Scottish. The manuscript is in the archives at Boston University. Although Barer does not describe the plot of The Saint's Lady, he does quote from the book, and it is notable that the novel would have seen the return of Templar's longtime girlfriend/partner Patricia Holm after an absence from the Saint series of more than 30 years (her most recent appearance as of 1979 having been in the 1948 short story collection Saint Errant. It is not known, however, if the title is a direct reference to Holm. Martin would have also become the first woman to publish an English-language Saint novel, although it is not known whether she would have received author credit on the cover as at this time the practice was for the books to be credited to Charteris (with the collaborative authors credited inside). This is not the only Saint novel to remain unpublished. Barer also provides an outline of Bet on the Saint, a 1968 collaboration between Charteris and Fleming Lee based on a Saint comic strip storyline, which was rejected by Doubleday (Charteris' American publishers). And, recently, an unpublished Charteris manuscript from the early 1940s, The Saint's Second Front, has been discovered.

It was directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The screenplay was by Robert Ardrey, adapted by George Froeschel from the 1823 novel Quentin Durward by Sir Walter Scott. It was the third in an unofficial trilogy made by the same director and producer and starring Robert Taylor. The first two were Ivanhoe (1952) and Knights of the Round Table (1953). All three were made at MGM's British Studios at Elstree, near London. The film had the distinction of a soundtrack composed by studio music mainstay Bronislau Kaper rather than Miklos Rozsa, who was busy on other projects at the time the film was ready for scoring. It was the first big-budget film for the British actress Kay Kendall, and it featured a large contingent of distinguished British players, including Robert Morley. Plot In 1465, honorable but penniless Scottish knight Quentin Durward agrees to go to France to find out if the beautiful young heiress, Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy, would be a suitable wife for his aged uncle (that is, if she is as rich as is claimed). The marriage has been arranged by Charles, Duke of Burgundy, for his ward to cement an alliance with Scotland, but she wants nothing to do with it, so she runs away and seeks the protection of Charles' great rival, Louis XI, King of France. Quentin pursues and manages to foil an attempted robbery by brigands under the command of Count William de La Marck, though Isabelle continues on her way unaware of her protector's identity. Nearing the court of King Louis, Quentin tries, but fails, to save the life of a gypsy. However, the dead man's brother, Hayraddin, is grateful for his efforts. Louis, who had ordered the man's hanging as a Burgundian spy, and distrusts such honest men as Quentin, orders him to leave France. However, the Scotsman is not easily deterred. He sneaks into the heavily guarded castle and awakens Louis in his bed with a dagger at his throat. Louis is impressed and enlists Quentin in his service. Upon the unexpected arrival of Count Phillip de Creville, a Burgundian ambassador seeking Isabelle, Louis orders Quentin to guard her and to keep her presence secret. During the time they spend together, she and Quentin begin to fall in love. Having lied about Isabelle being there, Louis commands her to depart. She tells him that she will seek sanctuary with an old friend, the Bishop of Liege. Louis concocts a plan to have De la Marck kidnap and forcibly marry Isabelle to keep her strategically important lands out of Burgundian hands. He has Hayraddin, who is a spy in his employ, take the information and a large bribe to De la Marck. Louis provides Isabelle with a detailed itinerary (the better for De la Marck to find her). He also lends her a few guards, including Quentin, so that when they are killed, it will divert any suspicion away from him. Hayraddin is also sent as a guide. However, when he discovers that Quentin is to be one of the victims, he warns the Scotsman. The three manage to escape the trap and reach Li√®ge, though Quentin is wounded. When he has recovered, he finally tells Isabelle of his obligation to his uncle, which prevents him from courting her himself, and leaves. De la Marck attacks the castle, captures Isabelle, and kills the bishop when he refuses to marry them. Hearing the sounds of battle, Quentin rescues his love. He slays De la Marck in an unusual duel in a burning bell tower, in which they swing from the ropes used to ring the church bells. Meanwhile, the Duke of Burgundy arrests Louis when he comes to continue peace negotiations, accusing him of orchestrating the murder of the bishop. However, Quentin arrives and exonerates the King, providing as proof De la Marck's severed head. Out of gratitude (and in France's best interests), Louis tricks Charles into letting Isabelle decide whom she will marry. Quentin has received news that his uncle has died, so he too is free to follow his heart. Cast * Robert Taylor as Quentin Durward * Kay Kendall as Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy * Robert Morley as King Louis XI * George Cole as Hayraddin * Alec Clunes as Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy * Duncan Lamont as Count William De la Marck * Laya Raki as Gypsy dancer * Marius Goring as Count Philip De Creville * Wilfrid Hyde-White as Master Oliver, the king's trusted barber and confidant * Eric Pohlmann as Gluckmeister * Harcourt Williams as Bishop of Liege * Michael Goodliffe as Count De Dunois * John Carson as Duke of Orleans * Nicholas Hannen as Cardinal Balus * Moultrie Kelsall as Lord Malcolm, the Scottish ambassador * Frank Tickle as Petit-Andr√© * Bill Shine (actor) as Trois-Eschelles * Ernest Thesiger as Lord Crawford, Quentin's uncle * Arthur Howard as the injured monk at Liege (uncredited) Production In 1951, MGM filmed an adaptation of Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott in Britain, starring Robert Taylor and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The studio was so pleased with the results that even before the film was released they were looking at a follow up for Taylor, and Quentin Durward was suggested. The project became a certainty when Ivanhoe became one of the biggest hits of Taylor's career. He was scheduled to make the film after completing Knights of the Round Table. Producer Berman thought that audiences would accept romance if it was presented \\"at face value, on a pure basis, as a clean unsmutty kind of thing and without sexy overtones. I haven't got any rules to lay down for successful pictures, but one fact is sure today - people want something besides words, beside conversation pieces from the screen. Once in a while you have a 'Streetcar', in which all the actors talk their fool heads off, and it's a hit anyway, but for myself I'm committed to pictures with action and scenic and pictorial scope.\\" A number of female stars were mentioned as possibles to appear opposite Taylor, including Deborah Kerr, Elizabeth Taylor, Ann Blyth and Grace Kelly. For a time, Robert Taylor's busy schedule saw Stewart Granger emerge as a contender to replace him but Taylor ended up playing the part. Grace Kelly turned down the film and Kay Kendall was given the part. Reception =Critical= Bosley Crowther gave the film a poor review in The New York Times writing, \\"it lacks for excitement when...the intrigues of France's Louis XI and the Duke of Burgundy are placed upon the screen in such lengthy and ponderous complexity that they exhaust and befuddle the mind.\\" \\"The times when this heavily stuffed contrivance does have a tendency to move are when Mr. Taylor is working to get himself out of jams...And the big terminal fight...swinging on bell-ropes...is pretty good.\\" =Box office= In contrast with Ivanhoe and Knights of the Round Table, the film did not perform well at the box office. According to MGM records, it made $658,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,517,000 elsewhere, resulting in a $1,226,000 loss.

She migrated to New York and became a highly successful entrepreneur who catered to the culinary tastes of other displaced African-American Southerners living in Harlem. She took the name Pig Foot Mary because she turned marketing traditional foods such as pigs' feet, hog maws, chitterlings (chitlins), and other foods into a thriving business. Though she did not attain the fame or millionaire status of Madam C. J. Walker, Dean was an early example of African-American entrepreneurial success in the post-Civil War era. Dean began by selling food in 1901 on 60th Street sidewalk out of a makeshift cart ‚Äî actually, a re- purposed baby carriage ‚Äî at the corner of West 135th Street (what is now Malcolm X Boulevard). Her wares included chitterlings, hogmaws, and pig's feet as well as corn. In time, she was able to afford a steam table booth, which she attached to the corner newsstand ‚Äî and she married the newsstand owner, John Dean. Her biography is summed up in these two paragraphs by prominent African-American journalist Roi Ottley, writing in 1943: She is described by James Weldon Johnson in his 1925 magazine article \\"The Making of Harlem\\": In 1908 she married John Dean, a postal worker and newsstand owner. Johnson provided a slightly different version in 1930's \\"Black Manhattan\\": Later life As Johnson notes, Dean invested her food stand profits in real estate and attained a considerable fortune, \\"several hundred thousand dollars\\" according to landmark information from the City of New York's Department of Planning.\\"Malcolm X Boulevard: Virtual Tour\\" (undated; post-1997) Department of Planning, City of New York, retrieved August 26, 2006. Ottley provides further detail, stating that John Dean encouraged his wife to invest: Ottley was enumerating these sums in 1917 dollars (the building purchase), 1923 dollars (the sale), and 1943 dollars (her eventual fortune). Adjusted for inflation, these sums record a remarkable history of accomplishment for a woman who arrived in New York City at the turn of the 20th century, alone, illiterate and completely impoverished. Lillian Harris Dean retired to California and died in 1929. Loretta Devine portrays a highly fictionalized version of Dean in the 1997 movie Hoodlum; she is a gangster's girlfriend who is murdered by her lover's enemies. Her story was memorialized in a Daniel Carlton play Pigfoot Mary Says Goodbye to the Harlem Renaissance.

He was considered one of the greatest Hungarian representatives of 19th-century Naturalism and Realism. Holl√≥sy was not highly productive as an artist and was more important as an influential teacher, who influenced the painters of the Nagyb√°nya artists' colony.

His parents were Armenians who had migrated to the area. He early expressed a talent and interest in art. As a young man, he went to Munich to study, as did many artists from Hungary because there was no academy of fine arts there. Holl√≥sy criticized the training at the Munich Academy, which was strongly based on copying classical models. He founded a private school where he gave free classes, attracting young talents who were interested in realistic portrayal. He opened the way to new styles by relying on his personality and by pointing out the merits of French painters, such as Gustave Courbet, who exhibited in the city. He abandoned the academic style in order to follow new trends in French painting, including Impressionism. He also \\"admired Jules Breton, Jules Bastien-Lepage and read Zola, Murger, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.\\"Julia Szabo, \\"European Art Centers and Hungarian Art (1890-1919)\\", Hungarian Studies, 1994, Vol.19, No.1-2, p.42, accessed 2 February 2013 He was more important as a teacher than a painter. His large-scale plan of R√°k√≥czi March, never progressed much beyond sketches, as he kept changing his mind. His landscapes painted in T√©cs≈ë include Landscape in T√©cs≈ë, Landscape with Stacks and Sunset with Stacks, in which he applied elements of en plein air and Impressionism. His self-portrait (1916), held by the Hungarian National Gallery, is considered one of his most harrowing pictures. Encouraged by Istv√°n R√©ti and J√°nos Thorma, his pupils and friends, Holl√≥sy spent the summer of 1896 in Nagyb√°nya (today Baia Mare, Romania) with his school. That is considered the founding of the Nagyb√°nya artists' colony, of which the painter K√°roly Ferenczy was another important early member. The more rural location provided many chances for painting outdoors. These artists and their followers played an important role in introducing impressionism and post-impressionism to Hungarian painting. Holl√≥sy soon settled down in Nagyb√°nya. With its naturalistic style and emphasis on plein air techniques, his school determined much of Hungarian painting for decades. Holl√≥sy left the Nagyb√°nya colony in 1901. The following year, he began to spend the summers in T√©cs≈ë (today Tiachiv, Ukraine, in the historic Maramure»ô region) with those students who followed him. During the winters, Holl√≥sy returned to Munich to run his school there. Legacy and honours *In 1966 the Hungarian National Gallery had a major exhibition of the colony's work: The Art of Nagyb√°nya.

Castano Primo borders the following municipalities: Lonate Pozzolo, Vanzaghello, Magnago, Nosate, Buscate, Cameri, Turbigo, Robecchetto con Induno, Cuggiono. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on October 11, 1984. History Castano was initially a Roman village that subsequently came under the Burgaria of Parabiago. It was converted to a military fortress by the Counts of Biandrate, passing eventually to the House of Visconti. During internal struggles within the House of Visconti, Castano was pillaged. The fortress was rebuilt in the 14th century and ownership passed to the Archbishop. Various periods of struggle and domination by the Visconti followed until, in 1447, Castano came under the control of the House of Sforza who gave it as fiefdom to a family favourite. In the 16th century the war between the French and Spanish waged around the town but remained it under the control of the Viscount of Brignano until 1717. By 1604 the population of Castano was around 1500 people. On 22 June 1636 Castano was nearly destroyed in the battle fought by the Spanish and Austrians against the French. With the end of the Brignano family, Castano came under Portuguese rule passing through the hands of various noble families, then was eventually conceded to the Austrians. From 1786 to 1791 Castano was part of the Province of Gallarate. With the end of Napoleonic rule, Castano again came under Austrian control. In 1848 much of the population emigrated to the nearby Province of Piedmont to escape the repressive rule of the House of Habsburg. Following the Battle of Magenta in June 1859, Castano became part of Lombardy. Name The name Castano most probably derives from the old \\"Silvae Castanae\\" (chestnut woods). Other sources suggest the original name was in fact \\"Castro Casteno\\", as town was close to a castle or other fortification. Those sources point to an ancient crest or shield of the town that depicts a red castle from which grows a leafy chestnut tree, still shown today on the stem of the current council. The suffix \\"Primo\\" was added by the then king, Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, by a decree dated 10 December 1863 to distinguish Castano from another town of the same name in the Province of Pavia.

It is situated next to the village of Seavington St Michael, about east of Ilminster, within the South Somerset district and had a population of 384 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The villages lie in a hollow within a larger area of low-lying hills and valleys running broadly east-west. A part of the South Petherton Hundred, originally the area included seven settlements (seven tons) which have gradually merged or vanished, but were the origin of the Seavington part of the village name. Even in the 20th century Seavington Abbots was recognised as a separate entity, although it is first recorded in 1030, when it was given by Canute to Athelney Abbey. History The manor was held by Alice Vaux around 1200 and was therefore known as Seavington Vaux. The earliest known windmill in Somerset, which was in the village, was given by Robert Vaux to Montacute Priory in 1212. In 1680 it passed to the Welmans of Pundisford (now known as Pitminster), and to the Vaughan Lees of Dillington in 1876. Since 2000 the village shop closed and plans have been developed for a community owned and run shop have been developed by the Seavington Community Shop and Services Association. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

History The success of the Enigma Variations in 1899 was followed by the initial failure of The Dream of Gerontius, which caused Elgar to become dispirited and declare that God was against art. Nevertheless, he received a commission from the Royal Philharmonic Society and began work on a new piece and soon reported that it was \\"cheerful and Londony, 'stout and steaky'...honest, healthy, humorous and strong, but not vulgar.\\"Letters from Elgar to A. J. Jaeger and Hans Richter quoted by Kennedy. The first performance was in the Queen's Hall, London at a Royal Philharmonic Society Concert, on 20 June 1901, conducted by the composer. He dedicated the work to his \\"many friends, the members of British orchestras.\\" The music was an immediate success and became one of Elgar's most popular works. It has been performed in the concert hall less frequently in recent decades. Description In its 15 minutes or so the overture gives a lively and colourful musical portrait of Edwardian London. 'Cockaigne' was a term used by moralists at that time as a metaphor for gluttony and drunkenness, while Britain adopted the name humorously for London. The work presents various aspects of turn-of-the-century London and Londoners. It begins with a quiet but bustling theme which leads into an unbroken sequence of snapshots: the cockneys, the church bells, the romantic couples, a slightly ragged brass band (perhaps the Salvation Army) and a contrastingly grand and imperious military band. The broad theme representing Londoners is, Michael Kennedy states, the first occurrence of Elgar‚Äôs trademark direction, 'nobilmente.'.Kennedy p.30 The work ends in a characteristically Elgarian blaze of orchestral sound, including a full organ. Mindful, perhaps, of the way Elgar brings his themes together at the climax of the piece, both Bernard Shaw and W. H. \\"Billy\\" Reed compared the work to Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg Prelude, which culminates in the combination of several themes. Shaw, in a long article on Elgar in 1920, wrote: :But if you say that Elgar's Cockaigne overture combines every classic quality of a concert overture with every lyrical and dramatic quality of the overture to Die Meistersinger, you are either uttering a platitude as safe as a compliment to Handel on the majesty of the \\"Hallelujah\\" Chorus, or else damning yourself to all critical posterity by uttering a gaffe that will make your grandson blush for you. Personally, I am prepared to take the risk. What do I care for my grandson? Give me Cockaigne.Laurence, p.722 Reed wrote: :The Cockaigne Overture does not eclipse the Mastersingers prelude, but neither is it outshone by Wagner's most symphonically satisfying introductory composition from which it actually borrows some procedures. Elgar's piece is as splendidly evocative a picture of Edwardian London as Wagner's is of medieval Nuremberg, and there is nothing to choose between the two in humour, mastery of construction and appositeness of scoring.Reed, p.181 Recordings Cockaigne is well represented on record.

Definition Let (X, T) be a Hausdorff topological space and let Œ£ be a œÉ-algebra on X that contains the topology T (so that every open set is a measurable set, and Œ£ is at least as fine as the Borel œÉ-algebra on X). Then a measure Œº on the measurable space (X, Œ£) is called inner regular if, for every set A in Œ£, :\\\\mu (A) = \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mu (K) \\\\mid \\\\text{compact } K \\\\subseteq A \\\\\\\\}. This property is sometimes referred to in words as \\"approximation from within by compact sets.\\" Some authors use the term tight as a synonym for inner regular. This use of the term is closely related to tightness of a family of measures, since a finite measure Œº is inner regular if and only if, for all Œµ > 0, there is some compact subset K of X such that Œº(X \\\\ K) < Œµ. This is precisely the condition that the singleton collection of measures {Œº} is tight. Examples When the real line R is given its usual Euclidean topology, * Lebesgue measure on R is inner regular; and * Gaussian measure (the normal distribution on R) is an inner regular probability measure. However, if the topology on R is changed, then these measures can fail to be inner regular. For example, if R is given the lower limit topology (which generates the same œÉ-algebra as the Euclidean topology), then both of the above measures fail to be inner regular, because compact sets in that topology are necessarily countable, and hence of measure zero.

He was a member of The Eight, a movement among several Hungarian painters in the early twentieth century who represented the radical edge in Budapest. They introduced Fauvism, cubism, and expressionism to Hungarian art. Early life and education  Born in Budapest in 1880 to a Hungarian Jewish family, P√≥r started drawing as a child. He was a student of L√°szl√≥ Gyulay in the School of Industrial Design in Budapest. Because the city had no art academy, many aspiring artists went to Munich, Bavaria to study, beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century. P√≥r was among them, studying with the German artist Gabriel von Hackl. Later Simon Holl√≥sy, who had taught some free classes in Munich, and other Hungarian artists who had studied there, founded their own center in 1896 at Nagyb√°nya (present-day Baia Mare, Romania). Founding artists included Istv√°n R√©ti, J√°nos Thorma, and K√°roly Ferenczy, often called the \\"Nagyb√°nya artists' colony\\". Their collective energy strongly influenced the development of twentieth- century Hungarian art.Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914, 2 Oct 2009 - Jan 2010 , Hungarian National Gallery, accessed 6 September 2010. P√≥r studied at Nagyb√°nya with Holl√≥sy for a short time. Career In the early 20th century, P√≥r went to Paris, where he studied with Jean Paul Laurens at the Acad√©mie Julian. He returned to Hungary and began his career, becoming a popular portrait painter. He also worked as a fresco painter. In 1909 P√≥r joined with The Eight, which had an exhibit New Pictures in Budapest that year. They first showed as The Eight in 1911, representing the advanced edge of Hungarian art culture. Others in the group were K√°roly Kernstok, R√≥bert Ber√©ny, Dezs≈ë Czig√°ny, B√©la Cz√≥bel, √ñd√∂n M√°rffy, Dezs≈ë Orb√°n, and Lajos Tihanyi. Although the painters mounted only three shows together, they participated in events with new music and literature, and were influential through the First World War. They shaped modernist art in the country. P√≥r and Kernstok especially adopted some of the ideas of the Fauvists and Cubists, as they were influenced by both German and French theories of the time.

Paris was closed during the Great War to artists from \\"non-allied\\" nations. After the fall of the Hungarian Democratic Republic in 1919, P√≥r was one of the many artists who emigrated; he went to Czechoslovakia. He primarily painted landscapes and pictures of animals. During this period abroad, P√≥r also traveled to France, Italy, and the Soviet Union on artistic patronage. He settled in Paris in 1938, where there were numerous other Hungarian √©migr√©s in the artistic circles, including a younger generation. Tihanyi died in Paris that year, but he had introduced P√≥r to his young nephew, Ervin Marton, who had come to Paris in 1937 and whose work in photography Tihanyi encouraged. During 1944‚Äì1946 after the Liberation of Paris, P√≥r worked with Marton and the writer Gy√∂rgy B√∂l√∂ni on reorganizing the Hungarian House, a center for the √©migr√© artistic community.

It is southwest of Bath and north of Shepton Mallet. It forms part of the Mendip district and lies along the A37 road south of the cities of Bristol and Bath and to the west of the town of Midsomer Norton. The parish includes the hamlet of Clapton. History The name Ston Easton comes from Easton or Estone, meaning town to the east of Chewton Mendip, and Ston or Stone from the geological strata in the area. To the north of the village is a round barrow tumulus. The village existed before the Norman Conquest and after 1066 was given to the Bishop of Coutances for his lifetime. In the reign of Henry III the manor was held by the family De Clifton who remained the lords until the reign of Edward III. By 1340 it had been divided into two manors. One was held by Simon de Trewhouse and the other by Bruton Abbey who held it until the dissolution of the monasteries when it was granted to John Hippisley. The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton. Ston Easton Park, a former country house noted for its Palladian architecture, built circa 1769 for John Hippisley Coxe, on a 17th-century foundation of which some fragments survive, is now a hotel and Grade I Listed building. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Clutton Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Church of St Mary The Virgin is a grade II* listed building dating from the 11th century, with a 15th-century embattled three-stage west tower. It was much rebuilt at the end of the 19th century, by Blomfield. The most striking interior feature is the Norman chancel arch, with semi-circular head and colonettes. The pews, choir stalls, altar rails, pulpit, font and screen are all 19th-century. There are several 18th- and 19th-century wall monuments.

Dresano borders the following municipalities: Mediglia, Tribiano, Mulazzano, Colturano, Vizzolo Predabissi, Casalmaiocco.  Etymology  The name Dresano is due to the presence, in these swampy areas, of three inlets, three \\"sinuses\\", from which the name evolved over the centuries: Tresseno, then Tressano and Tresano, and finally Dresano. The three inlets appear in the coat of arms too, surmounted by three poplar trees, the poplar being one of the most typical local trees.  History  Saint Benedict monk order convent, in Dresano town centre . Chiesa di San Giorgio martire, in Dresano town centre The old village hosts the remains of one of its most ancient buildings: on the East side of Piazza Manzoni the wall of an establishment with a massive wooden double door is found, which was part of the convent of the benedictines, who performed the hard task of draining and cultivating the swampy territories around. In this area malaria (swamp fever) took its toll.  Climate  Via delle camelie, Villaggio ambrosiano, covered by snow in January 2006 The climate in Dresano is characterised by sultry summers, and rainy, cold winters. Occasionally, heavy snowfall occurs; in 1995 a particularly heavy snowfall blocked the roads, paralysing traffic and forcing schools to close for several days. The end of August-early September is characterised by violent thunderstorms and heavy sleet which signal the end of summer.  Topography  The village is divided into four smaller areas: the old village (Dresano vecchio), Madonnina (built in the 1960s), Villaggio ambrosiano (erected in the 1970s) and Villaggio Helios (begun in the 1990s). The old village shows one of the oldest farms in the area, Cascina Belpensiero, which displays a secular tree in the middle of the farmyard. This dairy farm is already mentioned in written historical sources dating back to 1500, and it is still surrounded by fields, from the village. Every year, in May, the dairy farm holds the traditional \\"Quater Pass per un Vitel\\", an amatorial footrace, organised by the local sports group Gruppo Sportivo Marciatori San Giorgio (San Giorgio being the local patron saint). The prize for such race is a live calf. There are three different options for the race: , , and .

She was originally built in 1859 at New Albany, Indiana, for service on the Mississippi River and other waterways in the Trans- Mississippi Theater of the war. She was pressed into service at the start of the Civil War by the Confederacy, but was captured by the 76th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment on 18 August 1862, during a joint expedition to Milliken's Bend on the Mississippi. The Union Army took possession of the ship, and on 6 September 1862, Fairplay was commissioned into Federal service with Lieutenant Commander LeRoy Fitch in command. She was transferred to the Union Navy on 1 October 1862. From the base at Smithland, Kentucky, Fairplay operated with other gunboats in cooperation with the Army, patrolling the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio rivers, convoying troop transports and Army supply ships, and searching out and shelling concentrations of Confederates ashore. In August 1862 Fairplay was recaptured by the Union navy while it was transporting military supplies during the Vicksburg Campaign.Johnson, 1888, p. 358 On 3 February 1863, Fairplay was steaming up the Cumberland from the Smithland base to Nashville, Tennessee, guarding a convoy of transports during a lengthy campaign. She and the five other gunboats of the escort received word that the garrison at Dover, Tennessee, was under attack by a large Confederate force. The small flotilla sailed at full speed to disperse the main body of attackers, taking them by surprise, and then returned to complete the passage to Nashville. Fairplay continued to operate in the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio rivers, and on 3 December 1864, engaged a Confederate battery at Bell's Mill near Nashville. The next day, with the , she recaptured two transport steamers, previously taken by the Confederates and held at Bell's Mill.  Postwar history  After patrolling the same area after the war, as well as the Mississippi, she was decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois, on 9 August, and sold 17 August 1865.

It is situated next to the village of Seavington St Mary, about east of Ilminster, within the South Somerset district. It lies in a hollow within a larger area of low-lying hills and valleys running broadly east-west. A part of the South Petherton Hundred, originally the area included seven settlements (seven tons) which have gradually merged or vanished, but were the origin of the Seavington‚Äîpart of the village name. History The manor was held by Siward the falconer at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. By 1252 Adam the Dane then became known as Seavington Dennis. From 1483 to 1539 it was held by Glastonbury Abbey and after the dissolution of the monasteries he passed it to Winchester College, who held it until 1932. Seavington St Michael‚Äîthe smaller of the two villages with 57 dwellings and 125 inhabitants‚Äîappears to have become the more important since the motor car forced the building of New Road to straighten the London to Exeter route early in the 20th century, thus by- passing Seavington St Mary. Since then, in 1988 the new Ilminster by-pass has eliminated much traffic, although the road through Seavington St Michael is still a major access route to the market town of Ilminster. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. It evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. Tit is also responsibility for initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Michael dates from the late 12th century. It was given a porch around 1291, further alterations in the 15th century and a gallery was added around 1800. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

Arbeitslager () is a German language word which means labor camp. Under Nazism, the German government (and its private-sector, Axis, and collaborator partners) used forced labor extensively, starting in the 1930s but most especially during World War II. Another term was Zwangsarbeitslager (\\"forced labor camp\\"). The Nazis operated several categories of Arbeitslager for different categories of inmates. The largest number of them held civilians forcibly abducted in the occupied countries (see ≈Åapanka for Polish context) to provide labour in the German war industry, repair bombed railroads and bridges, or work on farms and in stone quarries. The Nazis also operated concentration camps, some of which provided free forced labor for industrial and other jobs while others existed purely for the extermination of their inmates. A notable example is Mittelbau-Dora labor camp complex that serviced the production of the V-2 rocket. See List of German concentration camps for more. The large chemical works at Monowitz and owned by IG Farben was near Auschwitz and was designed to produce synthetic rubber and fuel oil. The labour needed for its construction was supplied by several labour camps around the works. Some of the prisoners were Auschwitz inmates, who were selected for their technical skills, such as Primo Levi for example. Arbeitskommandos Arbeitskommandos, officially called Kriegsgefangenenarbeitskommando were sub- camps under Prisoner-of-war camps for holding prisoners of war of lower ranks (below sergeant), who were working in industries and on farms. This was permitted under the Third Geneva Convention provided they were accorded proper treatment. They were not allowed to work in industries manufacturing war materials, but this restriction was frequently ignored by the Germans. They were always under the administration of the parent prisoner-of-war camp, which maintained records, distributed International Red Cross packages and provided at least minimal medical care in the event of the prisoner's sickness or injury. The number of prisoners in an Arbeitskommando was usually between 100 and 300. One should differentiate these from sub-camps of Nazi concentration camps operated by the SS, which were also called Arbeitskommando. Because of the two different types there is some confusion in the literature, with the result of occasional reports of prisoners-of-war being held in concentration camps. In some cases the two types were physically adjacent, when both POWs and KL-inmates were working at a large facility such as a coal mine or chemical plant. British POW and Auschwitz prisoners working at IG Farben plant They were always kept apart from each other.

The diagnosis of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata can be based on genetic testing as well as radiography results, plus a physical examination of the individual. =Types= * Type 1 (RCDP1) is associated with PEX7 mutations; these are peroxisome biogenesis disorders where proper assembly of peroxisomes is impaired.update 2012 * Type 2 (RCDP2) is associated with DHAPAT mutations * Type 3 (RCDP3) is associated with AGPS mutations Treatment Management of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata can include physical therapy; additionally orthopedic procedures improved function sometimes in affected people. However, the prognosis is poor in this condition.

The Genetrix balloons reached altitudes of 50,000‚Äì100,000 feet (15‚Äì30 km), well above that flown by contemporary fighter planes. In 1955 a number of AN/DMQ-1 gondolas were launched from Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado as a test of the system. One was recovered years later in New Brunswick. Between 10 January and 6 February 1956, a total of 516 high-altitude vehicles were launched from the five different launch sites Gardermoen, Norway; Evanton, Scotland; Oberpfaffenhofen and Giebelstadt, West Germany; and Incirlik, Turkey; 54 were recovered and only 31 provided usable photographs. Numerous balloons were shot down or blown off course, and the flights led to many diplomatic protests from the target countries. MiG fighter pilots learned that at sunrise the balloons had dipped into shooting range because the balloons floated to a lower altitude as in the colder night air, the lifting gas cooled and became denser, reducing lift, so the balloons descended to lower altitudes where the air was denser. Authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on December 27, 1955, Project 119L was the first espionage use of the balloons that had been tested in previous projects, such as \\"Moby Dick High\\". Project 119L was a follow up to Project Skyhook, Project Mogul and Project Grandson. The balloons were used to monitor the Soviet Union for such things as nuclear tests, and returned photography of more than 1.1 million square miles (more than 2.8 million square km) of the Sino-Soviet bloc. Top-secret high-altitude balloon programs such as Moby Dick, Moby Dick High and 119L may account for many of the UFO sightings starting around the mid-20th century. The U-2 spy plane was later developed to replace the Genetrix balloons. The Soviets recovered many of these balloons and their temperature-resistant and radiation-hardened filmUsing film from U.S. spy balloons to take pictures of the Moon would later be used in the Luna 3 probe to capture the first images of the far side of the Moon.

Background Raji Alagbe Rasaki was born on 7 January 1947 in Ibadan, Nigeria. He attended Nigerian Military School, Zaria, for his secondary education and then the Nigerian Defence Academy, where he was commissioned an officer in the Nigerian Army. He held many command and staff positions: he was Adjutant, Lagos Garrison Signal Regiment (1970‚Äì71), Commanding Officer Second Signal Regiment, Commander Signal Support Brigade (1978‚Äì79), Commander Army Signal Corps, Commander Army Headquarters Garrison & Signal Group. Military governor Raji Rasaki was a one time military governor of Ogun State (1986‚Äì87) before his re-deployment to the nation's economic nerve center, Lagos State, becoming that state‚Äôs military governor in 1988. Soon after, he embarked on a massive demolition exercise of illegal structures to rid the State of shanties. That singular act resulted in the re-vitalization of Lagos, and a boom in the real estate market.. It also earned him the nickname of \\"acsion governor\\" (action governor), a mockery of the way in which he referred to himself. A member of the armed forces ruling council; he gained national prominence during the 22 April 1990 unsuccessful coup against the Ibrahim Babangida regime. The plotters led by the late Major Gideon Orkar had attempted to overrun the then seat of the Federal Government; Dodan Barracks, and in that process killing Babangida‚Äôs Aide de Camp, Major U.K. Bello. Late Major Orkar had announced many far-reaching declarations, which included radical restructuring of the federation bordering on the excision of five core northern States until the coup was foiled by officers loyal to Babangida. The first announcement to this effect came from the then military governor of Lagos state, Col. Raji Rasaki, who declared in a radio broadcast that the rebellion was already being contained. Later career Following his retirement from the army, Rasaki wrote several policy papers and memoirs. In addition he pursued a career as a statesman; participating in numerous conferences and forums. As a public speaker, he addressed audiences across the country and abroad. In 2005 he joined the Nigerian Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In 2016, he celebrated 40 years of his marriage to Senator Fatimat Olufunke Raji-Rasaki.Ex-Gov.

The name of the toy appears as Show'N Tell in some texts. was a toy combination record player and filmstrip viewer manufactured by General Electric from October 1964 to the 1970s at GE's Utica, NY facility. It resembled a television set, but had a record player on the top. Records and slides were sold for it in combination (known as Picturesound programs). The slide strips, a flat plastic key 11 inches long containing a strip of 16mm color film, was inserted into the top of the device. As the record played (typically telling a story), the slide strip, through which the images were projected on the screen, would automatically advance to illustrate it. The mechanism by which the slide advanced was purely mechanical, and was based on the rotation of the turntable, so proper operation required manually spinning it a few revolutions before beginning the presentation. The original selling price of the unit was $29.95 and Picturesound programs sold for 99 cents with \\"a library of five programs\\" selling for $4.95. Thirty-five programs were grouped in seven \\"libraries\\" initially: *Fairy Tales and Cartoons *Children's Favorite Classics I *Children's Favorite Classics II *History *Science and Space *The World We Live In *Steps to Knowledge Licensed film strip and record packages were produced for many different children's properties, including Disney and Sesame Street. An advertisement in LIFE Magazine also specifically mentions Pinocchio, Peter Pan, and the Wizard of Oz \\"as well as educational programs created by World Book Encyclopedia.\\" By 1965, there were 140 programs available. Each program moved through 15 color slides and ran approximately 4 minutes. It also functioned as a standard record player, able to play 16, 33‚Öì, 45, and 78 RPM records through its built-in speaker. General Electric released a \\"compact\\" version (Model A605) of the Show 'N Tell in 1966 for $19.95.

He was best known for writing the music to several hit Edwardian musical comedies, including A Chinese Honeymoon, The Arcadians and The Boy, as well as a number of other successful British musicals during the first two decades of the 20th century. Life and career Of Irish descent, Talbot was born in America in Yonkers, New York but moved to London at the age of four. His parents were Alexander Munkittrick and his wife, Lillie. Originally planning to enter the medical profession, he studied at King's College, London but switched to music and pursued a musical education at the Royal College of Music.The Times obituary, 13 September 1928, p. 7 There he studied under Sir Hubert Parry, Sir Frederick Bridge and Sir Walter Parratt.Standing, Percy Cross. \\"Chiefs of the Orchestras\\", The Crown, London, 24 May 1906, pp. 60‚Äì61, reprinted at Footlight notes, press clippings for the week ending 22 March 2003 For some years, although Talbot had had works staged by amateurs in Hunstanton, Oxford and King's Lynn, professionally he only succeeded in having a few of his individual songs performed in other people's productions. In 1895, Talbot married an actress known as Amy Clare Betts (birthname Ada Bellamy; 1871?‚Äì1895), but his bride died only eight months after their wedding. He later married Dorothy Maud Cross from Sandringham, Norfolk. The couple produced four daughters.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Talbot, Howard (1865‚Äì1928)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 September 2008, =1890s: early career= 2nd Anniversary Souvenir of A Chinese Honeymoon Talbot's first full professionally produced comic opera was Wapping Old Stairs in 1894. The success of this production in King's LynnThe musical magazine The Lute commented, \\"there is a freshness and vivacity in Mr. Talbot's music ‚Äì particularly in the opening numbers ‚Äì that as a modern comic opera entitle the work to more than ordinary consideration.\\" See \\"Opera in the Provinces\\", The Lute, 1 February 1894, p. 294 led to a transfer of the show to the Vaudeville Theatre in London. Despite a strong London cast including Jessie Bond, Courtice Pounds and Richard Temple from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the show was not well received in the West End and closed after one month. A follow up work, the burlesque All My Eye-van-hoe, was also a flop,The Theatre wrote, \\"the nadir of inanity has at length been reached ‚Ä¶ a chaotic hotchpotch of stale jokes and trite jests, of forced humour and meaningless fun.\\" The review did not mention the music. See All My Eye-Vanhoe, The Theatre, 1 December 1894, p. 318 and Talbot was forced to sue the producers for monies owed to him for this work.Howard Talbot biography at the British Musical Theatre site of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2003) At this time, Talbot earned the bulk of his living from conducting both in London and for provincial touring productions, such as The Lady Slavey, where managers appreciated his \\"cheery, goodnatured\\" attitude.The Era, 19 April 1902 Although he continued to compose, achieving some success both in Britain and America with Monte Carlo in 1896, Talbot's name was not yet considered to be a major force in British musical theatre, and he continued to be asked mainly to supply individual songs that were inserted into works primarily written by others.\\"Talbot, Howard,\\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Oxford Music Online, accessed 4 March 2011 The most successful shows that he conducted in London during this period were The Sorrows of Satan (1897) at the Shaftesbury Theatre and two Arthur Roberts vehicles, Dandy Dan the Lifeguardsman (1897), which included his song \\"Someone Ought to Speak to Millie Simpson\\", and Milord Sir Smith (1898). In 1899 he conducted Great Caesar. Talbot's first blockbuster hit was A Chinese Honeymoon, which opened in Hanley in 1899 and toured extensively before it was finally presented in London in 1901. A Chinese Honeymoon went on to become the first work of musical theatre in history to run for over 1,000 consecutive performances and found large audiences around the world. Talbot continued to conduct at the Gaiety Theatre, Daly's Theatre and other West End theatres and went on to compose or collaborate on two dozen musicals. He commanded a technical proficiency rare among Edwardian musical theatre composers, and his music is reminiscent of Arthur Sullivan's.Kenrick, John. \\"Who's Who in Musicals\\", The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film, Musicals101.com (2003) In addition to musicals, he produced a body of songs, piano pieces, orchestral works and a cantata. =20th century= Many of Talbot's shows in the first decade of the new century were successes that had international tours, including Kitty Grey (1901, to which he contributed songs including \\"Mademoiselle Pirouette\\"), The Girl from Kays (1902, contributing some songs), Three Little Maids (1903, contributing the concerted music and some lyrics), The Blue Moon (1904), The White Chrysanthemum (1905), The Girl Behind the Counter (1906), and The Belle of Brittany (1908). In addition, he contributed a few songs to other musicals and composed a few unsuccessful musicals. Scene from The Arcadians, 1909 In 1909, Talbot teamed up with Lionel Monckton to produce The Arcadians, which went on to become one of the most successful Edwardian musical comedies and has been described as the masterpiece of the genre.Article describing The Arcadians as the masterpiece of Edwardian musical comedy The musicals that followed this, such as The Mousm√© in 1911, The Pearl Girl in 1913, My Lady Frayle in 1915, Mr Manhattan in 1916, and other short works for music halls, were only modest successes, however, and musical styles began to change. In 1916 Talbot contributed to a reworking of an American musical, High Jinks for the Adelphi Theatre, which adapted a Rudolf Friml score. At the same time, he had been composing music for short musical pieces for variety theatres. The careers of other major composers of the Edwardian era (for example, Sidney Jones), began to fade by World War I when they failed to adopt the new American dance rhythms and styles, such as ragtime. However, in 1917, Talbot and Monckton were hired to write the score for the musical The Boy, based on Pinero's The Magistrate, a vehicle for American comedian Bill Berry, who had been the star of High Jinks. The Boy became one of the biggest hits of the wartime era, when audiences sought light, escapist musical comedy.Chu Chin Chow , Musical Theatre Guided Tour (PeoplePlay UK), accessed 3 October 2008 It was also adapted successfully on Broadway as Good Morning, Judge in 1919 and toured the English-speaking world. This was followed by another successful musical for Berry by Fred Thompson based on a Pinero play, composed with Ivor Novello, Who's Hooper? (1919).Who's Hooper? ‚Äì Novello/Talbot at the Guide to Musical Theatre, accessed 8 May 2010 A third Pinero adaptation, My Niece's (1921), was a flop and proved to be Talbot's final West End theatre score. Sheet music cover After retiring to the south of England, Talbot was ill with bronchial trouble for several years before his death. Nevertheless, he continued to compose musicals for the amateur companies with whom he had worked early in his career. He also wrote the successful march \\"All Hail Our King\\". Talbot died at his home at Reigate, England, at the age of 63.\\"Talbot, composer, Dies in London\\", The New York Times, 13 September 1928, p. 21 Notes References *G√§nzl, Kurt.

From the age of 5 until the age of 27 he lived in Canada, growing up in Ottawa, and studying in Toronto. He then returned to Venezuela, and lived in Caracas for the following 12 years. Now, since October 2003, although maintaining an active working base in Caracas, Bernardo has made Toronto, Ontario once again, his home. After graduating from the University of Toronto's Faculty of Music Performance program in 1986, Bernardo played tenor and alto sax in the Toronto Latin musical community, as well as recording with various local jazz projects (Don Valley Parkway, Mosaic) as a sideman. In the spring of 1991, Bernardo travelled to Habana, Cuba to study Cuban percussion and arranging until February 1992. Upon arriving in Caracas in 1992, he was quickly integrated into the jazz scene, and began playing with Venezuela's top jazz artists (Biela DaCosta, El Gallo Velasquez, Jes√∫s 'Chucho' Sanoja, and Martes 8:30, among others). During this time, Bernardo participated as tenor saxophonist on the following recordings: Biela DaCosta's 'Jazz and Blues' (1994), Andy Duran's 'Timeless' Vol.1 (1996), Ram√≥n Carranza's 'Carranza Jazz' (1996), Martes 8:30's 'Ayer y Hoy' (1998), Gerardo Chacon's 'Espacial' (2000), and Frank Quintero's 'Celebraci√≥n' (2003). In the commercial-pop genre, Bernardo has toured with Venezuela's internationally acclaimed artists: Kiara (singer), Luz Marina (as musical director) and Frank Quintero. From 1998 until early 2003, Bernardo divided his professional time equally in the areas of music production (for documentaries and television commercials) teaching and performing with his jazz group, with which he recorded his first Compact Disc as leader, composer, and producer: 'SEADANCE', released in 2001 and distributed internationally by Latin World Entertainment. Presently, Bernardo is concentrating on reintegrating himself into the Canadian jazz scene, and preparing for his next CD.

On July 29, 2015, after years of non-availability, the game was re-released on the digital distributor gog.com with Windows support.Exklusive bei GOG: Ab heute stehen neue Ubisoft- Klassiker bereit on Winfuture.com (John Woll, 29.07.2015) Plot The plot develops around a mercenary named Emerald \\"Deadeye\\" Flint, who takes up a seemingly simple task to escort a cargo ship, transporting the nearly worthless delivery of sulfur, through quiet waters. Shortly after the beginning of the voyage, the protagonist becomes the sole hostage after an anarchistic group of Shogunate mercenaries raid the convoy. However, he is released by their leader, H√≥ng L√≥ng, who is a well-known arch-enemy of, and has formed a love‚Äìhate relationship with the protagonist after helping him escape prison. Emerald \\"Deadeye\\" Flint is soon picked up by a freighter and dropped off in Magellan where his first mission is to bring himself and an attache to Emerald's boss, El Topo's base in a rusty old ship named 'Hiob'. After the player completes several missions as repayment to El Topo for the failure of the escort mission, the player is ordered to move to another location to look for a mercenary to assist him in obtaining the black box of the submarine Big Fat Mama. Eventually the player's ship is replaced by a faster scout called the 'Gator'. As the player continues to progress through the main story line his ship is replaced two more times, first by the slightly sluggish Atlantic Federation bomber 'Zorn', which introduces the player to a ship with significantly greater firepower. Finally the player ends up in a prototype EnTrOx bomber called 'Succubus', which is the fastest and most advanced submarine in Aqua. The Succubus gets confiscated from EnTrOx after their CEO is impeached and the company dissolved to end their monopoly on and control over Aqua's energy, transport, and oxygen resources. After several other missions, the player encounters a mysterious mothership during a simple recon mission that is traveling at higher speeds than any other submarine in Aqua. As the game progresses, they encounter more and more scouts of similar make, dubbed Bionts, due to the ships being of a bionic build where pilot and machine are fused together. In one mission, the player is required to paralyse a Biont scout (using EMP weapons) and allow the group to analyse the ship. Near the end of the game a great war breaks out between the Bionts and humans. During the war, the player's last mission is to escort H√≥ng L√≥ng who sacrifices herself in order to destroy the main control entity of the Bionts called Survion. Gameplay The game splits up into a series of primary and secondary missions, which allow the player to proceed in the storyline as well as earn additional funds. Those 'credits' can then be used to upgrade the various vessels owned by Emerald 'Deadeye' Flint with a huge array of offensive and defensive upgrades, such as additional, and/or more powerful primary weapons, torpedoes and torpedo storage and turret command software, generators, hull plating, Buzzers (technically underwater flares to break a torpedo's lock on the player's ship), noise reduction technology, a booster, and a fixer. The control of the game is designed for the use of a joystick. The player is confronted with maneuvering through narrow canyons, deep sea currents and enemy fire. They can also use their keyboard; W is forward A is back or brake. Hitting W twice will give the player a boost in acceleration if they have the 'Booster' installed. Reception Chris Hudak of GameSpot praised the game's open-endedness, also noting that this, combined with the sheer number of tactical options available could be very confusing to some players. PC Multimedia & Entertainment said Archimedean Dynasty \\"simply oozes perfection in almost every way\\", applauding the realistic physics and complex graphics of the 3D engine, the detailed storyline and game world, the compelling sound effects, and the strong combat. He cited the lack of a multiplayer mode as the one glaring omission. Next Generation likewise hailed the 3D engine for its realism and beauty, and the storyline for its depth. The reviewer commented, \\"Rather than feeling like you're just flying around a fishbowl, you really feel like you're underwater, in a single-seated attack submarine.\\" The game was commercially unsuccessful. Archimedean Dynasty was nominated as Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 \\"Science-Fiction Simulation\\" of the year, although it lost to Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri. In 2000, Computer Games Strategy Plus named Archimedean Dynasty one of the \\"10 Best Sci-Fi Simulations\\" of all time.

Many criticized the overuse of effects and visuals as well as the screenplay. However, the cast, direction, action sequences, choreography, and Li's and Chan's performances received the highest praise. In addition, The Forbidden Kingdom was a commercial success, grossing $128 million against a budget of only $55 million. Plot South Boston teenager Jason Tripitikas is a fan of martial arts films and awakens from a dream of a battle between the Monkey King and celestial soldiers in the clouds. He visits a pawn shop in Chinatown to buy wuxia DVDs and discovers a golden staff. On his way home, Tripitikas is harassed by some hooligans, whose leader Lupo attempts to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop, who is shot by Lupo. Hop tells Tripitikas to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Tripitikas flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop before being pulled off the roof by the staff. When Tripitikas regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in ancient China that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan, a supposed \\"immortal,\\" who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord. The Warlord tricked the King into setting aside his magic staff, Ruyi Jingu Bang, and transformed the immortal into a stone statue, but the King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about a \\"Seeker\\" who will find the staff and free the King. Just then, they are attacked by the Warlord's men again, but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow, a young woman. She reveals that her family was murdered by the Warlord, against whom she has sworn revenge. Meanwhile, the Warlord, upon learning about the staff, sends the witch Ni-Chang to help him retrieve it in exchange for the elixir of immortality. Tripitikas, Lu and Sparrow meet a strange man dressed in white who takes the staff away from them. Lu fights with the man (later revealed to be the Silent Monk) for the staff until the latter realizes that Tripitikas is the Seeker, and joins them in their quest to free the King. At the tea house Ni Chang interrogates the owner and kills a worker using her whip and speaks of her hatred for men. The owner's wife hands her a dagger used by Sparrow. As the four travel to Five Elements Mountain, Lu and the Monk teach Tripitikas kung fu along the way. After crossing a desert, they encounter Ni Chang who discourages Tripitikas and Sparrows love for each other. Ni Chang offers the boy return to where he came from in return for the staff, he declines. Lu asks of Ni Chang intentions, she tells him she will get the elixir of immortality for the staff. After a battle and escape, Ni Chang shoots Lu with an arrow. Tripitikas's team takes refuge in a monastery, where they learn that Lu is actually not an immortal as he failed the test, and only the Warlord's elixir can save his life. In desperation, Tripitikas goes to the Warlord's palace alone to exchange the staff for the elixir. Ni Chang leads Tripitikas inside. The Warlord asks Tripitikas to duel Ni-Chang to death, since the former can give the elixir to only one of them. Tripitikas is overpowered but manages to disarm the Ni Chang of her whip. Sparrow and Silent Monk and monks from the monastery arrive to join the battle. Ni Chang tries to claim her prize but is interrupted by Sparrow. Sparrow hits Ni Chang back but gets kicked. Ni Chang flies at Sparrow to scratch her but gets laid onto the palace floor. While the witch is distracted, Tripitikas manages to grab the elixir and tosses it to Lu, who drinks it and recovers. The Monk is mortally wounded by the Warlord and passes the staff to Tripitikas, who uses it to smash the King's statue. The King is freed and the Monk is revealed to be actually one of the King's clones. Before Ni Chang can kill Sparrow, Lu kicks her out onto the palace balcony. After being hit around by Lu, Ni Chang is enraged and jumps onto Lu who hits her back and grabs hold of her and kicks her into the air, she falls onto the balcony railing breaking it and falling into the valley. Ni-Chang attempts to use her hair to strangle Lu and climb up, but he cuts her hair before she can get up and she falls to her demise. After another long battle between the King and the Warlord, the latter is eventually stabbed by Tripitikas and falls into a lava pit to his death. However, Sparrow succumbs to her wounds. The Jade Emperor, having returned from his meditation, praises Tripitikas for fulfilling the prophecy and allows him for one wish, which he asks to return home. Tripitikas finds himself back in the present. He overpowers Lupo and drives the other hooligans away. Hop survives being shot and claims that he is immortal (hinting that he is actually Lu). Before the film ends, Jason is delighted to meet a woman who resembles Sparrow. Tripitikas continues honing his kung fu skills while Lu narrates the King's search for truth. Cast * Jackie Chan as Lu Yan / Hop, the pawn shop owner * Jet Li as the Monkey King / Silent Monk * Michael Angarano as Jason Tripitikas * Liu Yifei as Golden Sparrow / Chinatown Girl * Collin Chou as the Jade Warlord * Li Bingbing as Ni Chang * Juana Collignon as Southie Girl * Deshun Wang as the Jade Emperor Production details =Pre- production= While the character Sun Wukong came from Wu Cheng'en's famous classical novel Journey to the West, in an interview with Screen Power magazine, actor Collin Chou denied that the plotline would be related to the novel. The details of the plot were devised by screenwriter John Fusco along with actor Jet Li. Li explains, In a behind the scenes article he wrote for Kung Fu Magazine, screenwriter John Fusco also stated he derived the surname for the Jason Tripitikas character from \\"the wandering monk, Tripitaka, from Journey to the West\\". The Golden Sparrow character was inspired by Cheng Pei- pei's character Golden Swallow from the Shaw Brothers film Come Drink with Me. Before trying to kill the Jade Warlord, Golden Sparrow refers to the 1966 film, telling him to \\"Come drink with\\" her. =Production= Production began in early 1 May 2007 in the area around the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Before filming began, the entire cast did a costume fitting and a script read through, certain dialogues were altered to suit the different actors' English speaking abilities; this was due to the majority of the cast having English as their second language. Chan described the first day of shooting as \\"very relaxing\\" because the shots only required drama and walking, with no action. When the two martial arts veterans (Chan and Li) did film action scenes together for the first time, they both expressed how easy it was to work with one another. Chan explained: Filming finished on August 24, 2007, and the film went into post-production on September 29, 2007. Soundtrack Critical reception The response to The Forbidden Kingdom, by both critics and audiences, was mixed to positive. As of 1 May 2008, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 65% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 121 reviews -- with the consensus being \\"Great fight scenes, but too much filler\\". Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 57 out of 100, based on 26 reviews -- indicating mixed or average reviews. The Chinese press, however, responded to the movie less positively. Perry Lam wrote in Muse magazine, \\"As a Hollywood blockbuster, The Forbidden Kingdom offers no apologies for its American-Centrism. In fact, it wears it with pride like a badge of honor\\". Home media The Forbidden Kingdom was released on DVD and Blu-ray 9 September 2008. It sold about 1,199,593 units which translated to revenue of $22,921,609, bringing its worldwide total to $151,758,670. It is sold on single disc and two-disc special editions.

It is associated with the EBP gene and affects between one in 100,000 and one in 200,000 babies. Signs and symptoms Possible signs and symptoms may include Genetics Conradi‚ÄìH√ºnermann syndrome is a form of chondrodysplasia punctata, a group of rare genetic disorders of skeletal development involving abnormal accumulations of calcium salts within the growing ends of long bones. Conradi‚ÄìH√ºnermann syndrome is commonly associated with mild to moderate growth deficiency, disproportionate shortening of long bones, particularly those of the upper arms and the thigh bones, short stature, and/or curvature of the spine. In rare cases, intellectual disability may also be present. While evidence suggests that Conradi‚ÄìH√ºnermann syndrome predominantly occurs in females and is usually inherited as an X-linked dominant trait, rare cases in which males were affected have also been reported. The genetics of Conradi‚ÄìH√ºnermann syndrome have perplexed medical geneticists, pediatricians and dermatologists for some time, but a number of perplexing features of the genetics of the syndrome have now been resolved, including the fact that the disease is caused by mutations in a gene, and these mutations are simple substitutions, deletions or insertions and are therefore not \\"unstable\\". Scientists are still trying to understand exactly where the mutation occurs so that they can correct it. Diagnosis An important test to confirm a diagnosis of Conradi-H√ºnermann syndrome is evaluating the plasma for elevated levels of a substance known as sterols. Mutations of the EBP gene result in the accumulation of sterols in the plasma and certain tissues of the body. Sterol levels are measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Screening  Genetic screening for Conradi-H√ºnermann syndrome via the EBP Gene is offered by multiple providers. Treatment Treatment can involve operations to lengthen the leg bones, which involves many visits to the hospital. Other symptoms can be treated with medicine or surgery. Most female patients with the syndrome can live a long and normal life, while males have only survived in rare cases. Other name It is also known as Happle's syndrome, after the German Physician, Rudolf Happle (b. 1938), who wrote a series of papers about the disease in 1976. The name Conradi-H√ºnermann Syndrome is named for Erich Conradi (1882‚Äì1968), and Carl (Karl) H√ºnermann (1904‚Äì1978), both are German Physicians.

Lamar, Chappell was elected as his replacement in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843 and served in that position until 1845 when he did not seek re-election. Chappell was subsequently elected to one more term as a state senator in 1845 and served as the president of that body. In 1842 he married Loretto Rebecca Lamar, the younger sister of Judge Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (I) and Mirabeau B. Lamar, second President of Texas.

History CRN was founded in 1983 as Cable Radio Network to provide commercial radio programming to local cable television systems. CRN founder Michael Horn (who, at the time, was an on-air personality at Los Angeles‚Äô KFI AM) read an article in the trade publication Radio & Records that mentioned Los Angeles radio station KMET earned ratings points in the Phoenix market. Horn learned KMET was the audio source for a channel on a local cable system in Phoenix. Horn brought the radio-on-television idea to San Fernando Valley cable provider King Cable, where he soon programmed a country music channel. Seeking a more mass appeal, Horn changed the channel's format to oldies music. Two other cable systems ‚Äì Valley Cable and Falcon Cable ‚Äì then became interested and was used on a few Electronic Program Guides across America. Broadcast hookups were initially conducted through phone lines before the method became cost prohibitive. Horn invested more money and switched to satellite transmission. A branding change from \\"Cable Radio Network\\" to \\"CRN Networks\\" eventually followed. Noncommercial music channels from companies such as Digital Planet and DMX eventually were picked up by cable providers. Instead of competing with them, Horn switched CRN's programming to a talk radio platform. CRN Networks then became \\"CRN Talk\\" and, in 2007, \\"CRN Digital Talk Radio\\". The company's legal name remains Cable Radio Networks, Inc. Horn commissioned a company that worked with Arbitron (now Nielsen Audio) to determine CRN.s listenership. Results indicated that CRN shared a similar-size audience as MSNBC, Cinemax, and Fox Sports. In 2013, CRN Digital Talk Radio Launched CRN Digital Magazine, its own online magazine (no association with CRN Magazine) featuring lifestyle and entertainment stories written by CRN personalities. Programming CRN programs are produced both in house and in collaboration with other broadcasters. CRN broadcasts eight audio feeds: a main feed that carries mostly in-house offerings; direct network feeds from Sports Byline USA, The Answer, Talk Radio Network, Radio America; Fox News Radio, Westwood One; iHeart Radio, and others. CRN also airs a simulcast of XEAAA-AM (a female-oriented Spanish-language station based in Guadalajara, Mexico); and a seventh channel that duplicates and timeshifts some of the other feeds' programs. It is distributed, as its former name implies, mostly through various cable television providers, much in the way the more widely available Music Choice is distributed. However, it is also available via C band satellite, various terrestrial stations across the nation and on the Internet. Some of CRN‚Äôs first talk offerings included ‚ÄúPolka Parade‚Äù with Dick Sinclair and television and radio personality George Putnam‚Äôs ‚ÄúTalk Back‚Äù (which became a CRN exclusive). Former Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson co- host Ed McMahon also hosted his weekly Lifestyles Live program on CRN. Don Ecker‚Äôs ‚ÄúUFOs Tonight‚Äù, and the pro wrestling themed ‚ÄúSquared Circle‚Äù hosted by James \\"Shadowe\\" Boone were also CRN original programs. CRN Digital Talk Radio announced in June 2015 it would become the home for libertarian radio and television personality Larry Elder‚Äôs show. Less than two months later, Salem Radio Network announced it would add Elder‚Äôs program to its own national syndication lineup. CRN Digital Talk Radio original programming currently includes shows hosted by longtime radio personality Barry Farber, actor and former NFL player Fred Dryer. Actor Robert Conrad hosted his own CRN program until his death on February 8, 2020. There are also several food and wine lifestyle programs, such as the \\"What's Cookin'\\" franchise.

The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan discovered the congruences : \\\\begin{align} p(5k+4) & \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod 5,  p(7k+5) & \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod 7,  p(11k+6) & \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod {11}. \\\\end{align} This means that: * If a number is 4 more than a multiple of 5, i.e. it is in the sequence :: 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, . . . : then the number of its partitions is a multiple of 5. * If a number is 5 more than a multiple of 7, i.e. it is in the sequence :: 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 40, . . . : then the number of its partitions is a multiple of 7. * If a number is 6 more than a multiple of 11, i.e. it is in the sequence :: 6, 17, 28, 39, 50, 61, . . . : then the number of its partitions is a multiple of 11.  Background  In his 1919 paper, he proved the first two congruences using the following identities (using q-Pochhammer symbol notation): : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty p(5k+4)q^k=5\\\\frac{(q^5)_\\\\infty^5}{(q)_\\\\infty^6}, \\\\[4pt] & \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty p(7k+5)q^k=7\\\\frac{(q^7)_\\\\infty^3}{(q)_\\\\infty^4}+49q\\\\frac{(q^7)_\\\\infty^7}{(q)_\\\\infty^8}. \\\\end{align} He then stated that \\"It appears there are no equally simple properties for any moduli involving primes other than these\\". After Ramanujan died in 1920, G. H. Hardy extracted proofs of all three congruences from an unpublished manuscript of Ramanujan on p(n) (Ramanujan, 1921). The proof in this manuscript employs the Eisenstein series. In 1944, Freeman Dyson defined the rank function and conjectured the existence of a crank function for partitions that would provide a combinatorial proof of Ramanujan's congruences modulo 11. Forty years later, George Andrews and Frank Garvan found such a function, and proved the celebrated result that the crank simultaneously \\"explains\\" the three Ramanujan congruences modulo 5, 7 and 11. In the 1960s, A. O. L. Atkin of the University of Illinois at Chicago discovered additional congruences for small prime moduli. For example: :p(11^3 \\\\cdot 13k + 237)\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod {13}. Extending the results of A. Atkin, Ken Ono in 2000 proved that there are such Ramanujan congruences modulo every integer coprime to 6. For example, his results give :p(107^4\\\\cdot 31k + 30064597)\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{31}. Later Ken Ono conjectured that the elusive crank also satisfies exactly the same types of general congruences. This was proved by his Ph.D. student Karl Mahlburg in his 2005 paper Partition Congruences and the Andrews‚ÄìGarvan‚ÄìDyson Crank, linked below. This paper won the first Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Paper of the Year prize. A conceptual explanation for Ramanujan's observation was finally discovered in January 2011 by considering the Hausdorff dimension of the following P function in the l-adic topology: :P_\\\\ell(b;z) := \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty p\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ell^bn+1}{24}\\\\right)q^{n/24}. It is seen to have dimension 0 only in the cases where ‚Ñì = 5, 7 or 11 and since the partition function can be written as a linear combination of these functions this can be considered a formalization and proof of Ramanujan's observation. In 2001, R.L. Weaver gave an effective algorithm for finding congruences of the partition function, and tabulated 76,065 congruences. This was extended in 2012 by F. Johansson to 22,474,608,014 congruences, one large example being :p(999959^4\\\\cdot29k+ 28995221336976431135321047) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{29}.

Geography Rescaldina borders the following municipalities: Cislago, Gorla Minore, Gerenzano, Marnate, Uboldo, Castellanza, Legnano and Cerro Maggiore. Except for Legnano and Cerro Maggiore, the other municipalities belong to the Province of Varese. The municipality counts two civil parishes (frazioni): Ravello and Rescalda. Population Rescaldina has a total of 14,211 inhabitants with a density of 1,770/km¬≤ (4,584/sq mi). The foreign inhabitants of Rescaldina have increased in number during the last decade: in 2019 the town had 1206 people having a foreign citizenship, most of them coming from east Europe, especially from Albania and Romania.  History  Earliest traces of human presence in the area of the present Municipality of Rescaldina date back to the ancient Rome civilization period as demonstrated by a Roman ara (altar) found here. The ara was probably placed near the main Roman road that ran along the top of the eastern Olona river bank (Olona valley). After having stayed for several decades at the entrance of the local cemetery, the ara is now placed in the parish house courtyard. The first rural settlement (grangia) was probably made by Cistercian monks in the middle age. Two major rural settlements grew in the area: Rescalda and Rescaldina. Rescaldina was elevated to parish by St Charles Borromeo in 1570 and placed within the Pieve of Legnano. Rescalda inhabitants requested their parish autonomy which was refused. They reacted by self-taxing in order to sustain a priest to guide their community: the parish of Rescalda was then created in 1608 and placed within the Pieve of Busto Arsizio. This method of self-taxing to sustain their priest gave Rescalda inhabitants the right to elect their parson until the Second Vatican Council. The latest parson was elected by the community in 1959 - Rescalda had been the second last parish to exercise that right in the Diocese of Milan. Two buildings in Rescaldina still show the coat of arms of the Visconti of Milan which support the legend of a summer hunting lodge belonging to that noble family, hence placing Rescaldina under the control of the Duchy of Milan since the 13th century. Although the legend has never been confirmed by documents, it is the basis of the city coat of arms which shows a wolf escaping from the main tower of a castle. It reminds the daring escape of a noble named Lupo da Limonta (Lupo means wolf), who was imprisoned in the tower presently located in via Roma 7, which still shows a Visconti coat of arms engraved on its walls. During the fight for power between Visconti and Sforza families, the noble prisoner was helped free by a jester named Tremacoldo, thanks to a ruse. One day Tremacoldo was admitted to a Saracen Joust, but he made it possible to be replaced by Lupo da Limonta dressed up such that no one could recognize him. When the tournament began, instead of heading towards the Saracen target, Lupo ran away. The House of Lampugnano (or Lampugnani) has been one of the most important families who ruled Rescaldina from the 14th to the 17th century. During that period, Rescalda had a population two to three times larger than Rescaldina. The House of Melzi - based in Legnano - used to own a huge amount of land and buildings in the municipality of Rescaldina during the last centuries, such as the Casa della Curti Granda which was used as their rural residence. In 1730 the Mail√§nder Kataster (Milanese cadaster) showed that the majority of the Rescaldina area was shared among noble families. The 1807 census showed that Rescaldina had a population of 207 people and Rescalda a population of 630; the main occupation was agriculture. With the Italian unification Rescaldina and Rescalda were merged into the Municipality of Rescaldina as it is nowadays. Economy Agriculture was the main occupation of the population until the late 19th century. In 1830 the textile company Bassetti was founded in Milan and in 1840 it created its first plant in the rural village of Rescaldina. The plant quickly developed and from the first decades of the 20th century the mechanization of the textile plant induced the full industrialization of the town. At present Bassetti is part of the Zucchi textile group which houses the Zucchi Collection museum in its headquarters in Rescaldina. The museum is considered to be one of the biggest collections of handblocks for printed fabrics in the world ranging from the end of the 18th century to 1930. On 5 October 1887 the opening of the railway line Saronno- Busto Arsizio links Rescaldina to both Milano and Novara, its station being the first after Saronno towards Novara. The railway was built by FNS, then operated by Ferrovie Nord Milano (nowadays Trenord) since 1890. On 21 September 1924 the first toll highway in the world was opened, the Autostrada dei Laghi which passes by Rescaldina. Two exits on the A8 branch (Milano- Varese) directly serve Rescaldina, and the nearest exit on the A9 branch (Milano-Como Chiasso) is just 6 km away. The presence of both the railway and the highway highly contributed to the social and economical development of the town: easy commuting to Milan boosted the education and job opportunities. At the end of the 20th century Rescaldina experienced the same changes as its wider area (Alto Milanese) i.e. from manufacturing to service industry. Although several top-class small advanced technology plants have developed, the largest increase of business is in the commercial sector with several shopping centers that take advantage of the nearby highway exits on A8 Milano- Varese (Legnano and Castellanza), and on A9 Milano-Como Chiasso (Saronno and Uboldo) which also provides quick connection to Switzerland. The railway line was doubled in the 1990s and now connects Rescaldina to Milan Malpensa Airport directly as well.

Directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Pandro S. Berman, it was the first film in CinemaScope made by that studio. The screenplay was by Talbot Jennings, and Noel Langley from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, first published in 1485 by William Caxton. The film was the second in an unofficial trilogy made by the same director and producer and starring Robert Taylor, coming between Ivanhoe (1952) and The Adventures of Quentin Durward (1955). All three were made at MGM's British studios at Borehamwood, near London and partly filmed on location. The cast included Robert Taylor as Sir Lancelot, Ava Gardner as Queen Guinevere, Mel Ferrer as King Arthur, Anne Crawford as Morgan Le Fay, Stanley Baker as Modred and Felix Aylmer as Merlin. The film uses the Welsh spelling for Arthur's nemesis, Modred, rather than the more common Mordred. In addition to the same producer, director and star, the first two films in the trilogy had the same cinematographer (F. A. Young), composer (Miklos Rozsa), art director (Alfred Junge) and costume designer (Roger Furse). The costumes for this film were executed by Elizabeth Haffenden.Knights of the Round Table: A Story of King Arthur - Text based on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer CinemaScope film (Ward, Lock ‚Ä¢ London and Melbourne) [1954] page 5 In 1955 she would take over from Furse as costume designer for the final film in the trilogy, Quentin Durward. Alfred Junge remained as art director. Plot =Arthur removes the sword from the anvil= With the land in anarchy, warring overlords, Arthur Pendragon (Mel Ferrer) and his half-sister Morgan LeFay (Anne Crawford) meet as arranged by the sorcerer Merlin (Felix Aylmer) to discuss how to end the bloodshed. Morgan maintains that as she is the only legitimate offspring of the late king, the throne belongs to her, but Merlin puts the adversaries to a test to determine England's rightful ruler. Merlin leads them to Excalibur, a sword embedded in an anvil, and says that according to legend, whoever can remove the sword shall be England's true sovereign. Morgan's knight champion and lover Modred (Stanley Baker) tries in vain to extract the sword, but Arthur removes it easily. Modred accuses Merlin of witchcraft, and a hearing is arranged with the Council of Kings at the circle of the stone. After advising Arthur that he must prove himself worthy of the throne by his deeds, Merlin instructs him to return the sword to the anvil. =Lancelot encounters Elaine, Arthur, Modred and Guinevere= Meanwhile, the French Knight Lancelot (Robert Taylor) and his men ride toward the Ring of Stones, hoping to offer their services to Arthur. On the road, Lancelot encounters a young woman named Elaine (Maureen Swanson), who quickly falls in love with him. They are waylaid by Modred's men, and Lancelot bravely does battle with all of them. Arthur arrives and joins in the battle. Lancelot, claiming he needed no help, challenges Arthur, unaware of his identity. After a long, exhausting fight, Lancelot finally asks his opponent's name, and when he learns that it is Arthur, he breaks his sword against a tree and kneels before him. They are joined by Elaine's brother Percival (Gabriel Woolf), who asks to be Arthur's knight errant. Later, at the Ring of Stones, Arthur and Modred debate before the Council of Kings. When the crowd turns against Arthur and Lancelot, they are forced to flee, vowing to take the kingdom on the battlefield. Arthur and his men lie low throughout the cruel winter, then launch their attack against Modred's men in the spring. Despite being greatly outnumbered, Arthur's men win and he is crowned the King of England. In the interest of peace, Arthur immediately pardons all his former enemies, but when Lancelot objects to Modred's pardon, the two men angrily part ways. Following the battle, Lancelot discovers that the lovely Guinevere (Ava Gardner) has been kidnapped by a mysterious knight and rescues her, unaware that she is Arthur's fianc√©e. Following Arthur and Guinevere's wedding, the king's joy is complete when Lancelot arrives at Camelot and pledges his allegiance anew. Arthur swears to join the select group of knights at the Round Table and England enjoys a period of peace and prosperity.The Knight who had kidnapped Guinevere repents, joining the Knights of Arthur¬¥s court. One day, Percival brings Elaine to court and asks Guinevere to make her a lady-in-waiting. =Morgan and Modred plot against Arthur and Lancelot= Meanwhile, Morgan and Modred continue to harbor ill feelings against Arthur, and note with interest the growing warmth between Lancelot and Guinevere. Merlin privately warns Guinevere that Morgan will tell Arthur of her suspicions about Guinevere's love for Lancelot. Because of this, Guinevere tells Lancelot she knows of his secret love for her and urges him to marry Elaine. Lancelot proposes to Elaine and asks Arthur to let him go to fight the Picts on the Scottish borders. One night, Lancelot and Elaine are visited by Percival, who relates how a heavenly vision instructed him to go on a quest for the Holy Grail, the cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper. Modred calls a meeting of Arthur's enemies in Scotland and urges them to make peace so that Lancelot will be forced to return to Camelot, where he will eventually be exposed as Guinevere's lover. Word of peace reaches Arthur at Camelot at the same time that Lancelot's infant son Galahad, whose mother, Elaine, died in childbirth, is brought to court with instructions that he be sent to Lancelot's father. Sensing a plot, Merlin argues against bringing Lancelot back to Camelot, but Morgan poisons him, and the knight returns amid great fanfare. Late one night, jealous after seeing Lancelot kiss another woman (Lady Vivien), Guinevere goes to his rooms, unaware that she is being spied on by Morgan and Modred. Lancelot angrily denounces Guinevere's folly in coming to him, and Modred's men soon arrive to arrest them for high treason. Lancelot fights them off and flees with Guinevere. Lancelot and Guinevere are tried in absentia at the Round Table and declared guilty. Lancelot suddenly walks in and surrenders, and when he confesses his chaste love for Guinevere, Arthur revokes their death sentence. Over Modred's protest, Arthur orders that Guinevere be confined and banishes Lancelot from England. =Civil war, death of Arthur and Modred, vision of the Holy Grail= Outraged at this show of mercy, Modred succeeds in turning the other knights against Arthur, and civil war returns to the land. Arthur meets with Modred and agrees to his terms for ending the war, which include disbanding the Round Table. When one of Arthur's men draws his sword to kill a snake, however, the battle cry is sounded. Arthur is mortally wounded, and Lancelot returns from exile to be at his side. With his dying breath, Arthur commands Lancelot to destroy Modred and give Guinevere his love and forgiveness. Lancelot fulfills Arthur's dying wish to hurl Excalibur into a lake. He calls on Guinevere at the convent and conveys Arthur's message, then rides to Modred, challenging him to a fight to the death. A fierce one-on-one battle ensues, with Modred at the upper hand. At the edge of a cliff, Modred gets on top of Lancelot, trying to stab him with a knife, but the tides suddenly turn, allowing Lancelot to turn the knife around and impale Modred before getting pushed off the cliff. While Modred slowly dies, Lancelot falls into a swamp that begins to suck him in. Soon Lancelot¬¥s horse Barrack saves its master by throwing its reigns into Lancelot¬¥s hands. After Lancelot and Barrack get out of the swamp, they witness Morgan weeping for the loss of Modred. Having won his battle, Lancelot walks away.

These include: Ralph Truman as King Marr of the Picts, Henry Oscar as King Mark of Cornwall, Desmond Llewelyn as a herald, and Patricia Owens as Lady Vivien. Valentine Dyall spoke the opening narration. Laurence Harvey was included as a cast member in an early edit of this article - and also on IMDb - but his participation in this film remains unconfirmed. Filming The film had some sequences shot near Tintagel Castle, Cornwall, with local people as extras. Scenes for the first battle were shot at Luttrellstown Castle Estate in Co. Dublin, Ireland. Woodland scenes and the hawking scenes were shot at Ashridge Forest, Herts. The Torquilstone Castle set designed by Alfred Junge for Ivanhoe (1952) was expanded and re-dressed as Camelot. Most of the indoor filming was at MGM-British Studios, Borehamwood, Herts. George Sanders was originally cast as Modred but fell ill prior to shooting and was replaced by Stanley Baker, who had just made an impression in The Cruel Sea (1953). The film was apparently shot on Eastmancolor stock, like Quentin Durward (1955), but it was advertised only as being 'in COLOR magnificence'. [See poster on Infobox above.] The film itself credits no color process. IMDb attributes the prints to Technicolor's laboratory, but it is not listed as one of the corporation's film prints in Fred E Basten's book Glorious Technicolor.Fred E Basten ‚Ä¢ Glorious Technicolor: The Movies' Magic Rainbow (A S Barnes/Thomas Yoseloff ‚Ä¢ 1980) pp169-194 Production was interrupted by labor disputes when two hundred extras (all members of the British extras' union) struck, demanding a pay increase.

Decent Films Guide reviewer Steven D. Greydanus gave the film a \\"B\\", stating, \\"a solid adaptation of the King Arthur legend, Knights of the Round Table benefits from its colorful pageantry and strongly Christian milieu, including a royal Catholic wedding and a transcendent moment of revelation involving the Holy Grail.\\" Awards and nominations Knights of the Round Table was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (Alfred Junge, Hans Peters, John Jarvis) and Sound Recording (A. W. Watkins). It was also nominated for the Grand Prix at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival.

In that time, he won four All-Ireland titles and two All Star awards, as well as having the honour of being included on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century. He picked up two NHL titles also, in 1990 and 1995. A tall and strong hurler, the red-haired Power was often the focal point for Kilkenny attacks through the middle, scoring and creating chances for others.  Hurling career  =Club= John Power played his club hurling with the local club in Callan, John Lockes. An early highlight of his club career came in 1984 when he captained the team to a minor league and championship double. However, the county championship has remained beyond the club's reach in recent years . =College= Power was part of the Callan CBS team that lost twice in successive years in the All Ireland colleges‚Äô B final to Cashel CBS and Nenagh CBS respectively, from 1982 to 1983 taught him that in successive years. =County= Power's inter-county career got off to a bad start, with a loss to Limerick in the All-Ireland Minor final in 1984, losing out (2‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì4) after a replay in Thurles. By 1985 he was off to a good start making some appearances in the All Ireland under-21 championship, but ended up breaking a wrist before the final and missed out, although Kilkenny lost out to Tipperary anyway. Injury cost him an NHL medal in 1986, picked up against Westmeath in Portlaoise. Better was to follow that year though, as he picked up an All Ireland junior hurling medal. Power came into the team for the final at right half back, replacing his brother Michael who had broken his finger in the semi-final. In 1989, a good performance at midfield on his senior championship debut unfortunately came on a bad day for Kilkenny, who were beaten conclusively by Offaly. Worse was to come in 1990, when a sick and off-form Power was substituted in the loss to Offaly. Power finally won his first Leinster medal in 1991, scoring a decisive injury time goal at the end of the first half against neighbours Wexford. Power had established himself as a powerful centre half forward, with a knack for winning high balls and then turning to barge forward through the middle, as he commented himself in 1991: \\"I love to be driving forward and heading for goal, though in all honesty I‚Äôm probably more suited to a wing back position\\". Power went on to add three more Leinster medals in 1992, 1993 and 1999. In 1992, Power won his first All- Ireland medal with Kilkenny, kicking a goal in the victory against Cork. The success continued in 1993, and Power picked up his second of two consecutive All Star Awards for his powerhouse performances at centre half forward, consolidating his position as the best number 11 in the country. He was part of the team that lost in the final to Cork in 1999, but returned to claim winners' medals again in 2000 and as a substitute in 2002.  Retirement  Power formally announced his retirement from inter-county hurling in autumn 2004. Nevertheless, he continued playing with his club as well as training some of the under-age teams. He is married to Margaret, with whom he has four children, including twin boys. He is a farmer by trade.

Reynolds was one of the founding members of The Kingston Trio, whose folk and folk-style material captured international attention during the late Fifties and early Sixties.  Biography  = Early life = Born in San Diego and growing up in Coronado, California, his passions as a boy growing up were tennis, skin-diving and singing with his family. His father, a Navy captain, was an avid guitar player who brought back songs from his travels around the world. He taught Nick the guitar and ukulele, and the family spent many nights singing and harmonizing for pure enjoyment. Nick enrolled in Menlo College in 1954 as a business major, and met Bob Shane in an accounting class. They soon started hanging out, drinking, and chasing women together, and this, in turn, led to playing music, initially as a way of being popular at parties ‚Äî Shane's guitar and Reynolds' bongos became a fixture at local frat gatherings, and after a few weeks of this, Shane introduced Reynolds to Dave Guard. = Career = The Kingston Trio was certainly largely inspired by The Weavers, but carried the concept of a folk- group, especially one featuring a guitar/banjo combination, further into the mainstream of mid-to-late 50s popular music. In turn, the Trio became an early inspiration to countless groups, including The Beach Boys ‚Äî whose striped shirts, on their first album cover, intentionally emulated what the Kingston Trio wore ‚Äî and Peter, Paul and Mary ‚Äî who owe their fundamental concept as a mainstream, folk/pop group, to its originators, The Kingston Trio and The Weavers. Shane returned to Hawaii for a time to work for his father's sporting goods company. Guard and Reynolds began playing with Joe Gannon on bass and singer Barbara Bogue, and became Dave Guard & the Calypsonians. Reynolds then left for a time following his graduation and was replaced by Don McArthur in a group that was known as the Kingston Quartet, and in a resulting shuffle, Reynolds and Shane (back all the way from Hawaii) returned to the group, now rechristened the Kingston Trio. Their initial approach to music was determined by the skills that each member brought to the trio ‚Äî Nick Reynolds sang a third above the melody and played tenor guitar, as well percussion instruments, such as bongos, congas, and BooBams. Reynolds provided the group with an ebullient vocal style, superb harmonizing, and an ability to convey tender lyrics with a touching intimacy. The trio disbanded in 1967 but was revived in 1969 as \\"The New Kingston Trio\\" under the direction of original member Bob Shane. It continues to the present under its original name, although Shane retired from performing in 2004. When the Trio disbanded, Reynolds moved to Oregon where he spent twenty years ranching and raising 4 children. When the group disbanded, Reynolds returned to motor racing, which he had first tried as a novice in the early 1950s. He helped finance Nade Bourgeault operation in Mill Valley, California and raced the Bourgeault Formula C car in the Northern Pacific Division of the SCCA in 1967, finishing second in the divisional championship. He moved up to Formula B in 1968 with a Brabham BT21 and was again second in the Divisional title. In 1981 the Trio reunited, featuring Bob Shane, Nick Reynolds, Dave Guard, John Stewart, George Grove and Roger Gambill. A PBS Reunion Special was recorded, hosted by Tommy Smothers and featuring special guest Mary Travers. In 1983, Nick Reynolds (known within the group as \\"Budgie\\") collaborated with John Stewart and Lindsey Buckingham on a new album/CD Revenge of the Budgie with seven new recordings. In the mid-eighties Reynolds moved back to California and rejoined the Trio from 1988 through 1999. He retired for the second time in December, 1999. Folk Music Archives interviewed the Trio in San Antonio and New York City when Nick Reynolds performed in his last show with the group during a concert with the San Antonio Symphony. Reynolds lived the last years of his life comfortably in Coronado, California with his wife Leslie. For eight years, he joined John Stewart to do a ‚ÄúTrio‚Äù fantasy camp in Scottsdale, Arizona. In addition to sharing a dinner with a question-and-answer session, campers joined Reynolds and Stewart on stage to perform a song, becoming for that one moment a member of a fantasy \\"Kingston Trio.\\" Nick Reynolds died on October 1, 2008, in San Diego, California from acute respiratory disease.

San Giorgio su Legnano borders the following municipalities: Legnano, Villa Cortese, Canegrate, Busto Garolfo. It is located in the Po Valley northwest of Milan, from which it is 34 km away, near the valley in which the Olona river flows. Located slightly higher than the neighbouring Legnano (hence the preposition \\"su\\", en. \\"up\\", in the name), it is one of the smaller municipalities in the metropolitan city of Milan. Since 1957, the town has hosted the annual Campaccio competition, a cross country running event which attracts world class athletes.3 STELLE CHE ILLUMINANO IL CAMPACCIO. Unione Sportiva Sangiorgese. Retrieved on 2011-01-12. On 10 December 2006, San Giorgio su Legnano hosted the 2006 European Cross Country Championships.  Geography  = Territory = The territory of San Giorgio su Legnano is located at the northern edge of the Po Valley, south of the Alpine foothills. It rises on a moorish plateau at the edge of the hollow dug by the Olona river. The soil consists mainly of pebbles, gravel, sand and clay. Originally the territory was covered with a thin layer of humus unsuitable for forest growth and agricultural cultivation, so as to be largely moorland. The territory has an area of 2.3 square kilometer and is distributed on land that has an altitude of between 189 m and 201 m above sea level. According to the seismic hazard, the municipality is in zone 4 (irrelevant seismicity), as established by PCM ordinance 3274 of 20/03/2003. = The town = The urban fabric of San Giorgio su Legnano has developed around the old town. Then, gradually, between 1914 and 1958, San Giorgio was the subject of a marked urbanization that led to the occupation of most of the area of the municipality. At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the number of new citizens entering the area, who have started to work in the fledgling industries in the area; as can be seen from demographic trends, between 1861 and 1961, the population of San Giorgio quadrupled. Then, due to the various economic crises that followed in the decades of the 20th century, a new phase began that led to the closure of many companies with the consequent birth of many brownfield areas, many of which were recovered.  Climate  San Giorgio su Legnano during a foggy day According to , San Giorgio su Legnano is in Zone E with a rating of 2451 GR/G. Due to its location in the upper Po Valley, San Giorgio su Legnano has a Continental climate with cold winters characterized by many days of snowfall and fog. Summers are hot humid, and moderately wet; temperatures can exceed and humidity 80%. That humidity persists for the entire year because of precipitation brought on by cyclones originating in the Mediterranean or in the Russian north. That precipitation itself remains in the Po Valley because of its poor ventilation. Data from the indicates that, based on the more than thirty years (1961‚Äì1990) of reference accumulated by the World Meteorological Organization, that the average temperature of the Milan area the coldest month, January, is and that of the hottest month, July, is . Rainfall averages at and has peaks in spring and autumn, countered by a relative drop during the winter. The basic climatic data of San Giorgio su Legnano are:  Toponymy  Castello Visconteo of Legnano, also known as \\"castello di San Giorgio\\" The reference to the saint in the name of the municipality comes from a small church dedicated to Saint George attached to a convent of Augustinian friars present in the Legnano countryside, whose existence is attested by a manuscript of 1261. This monastery was the original nucleus of the Castle Visconteo of Legnano. It is likely that the presence of this monastery has then determined the title to Saint George, as well as the castle, also of a district of Legnano (the \\"Costa di San Giorgio\\") and the nearby municipality of San George su Legnano. In the Middle Ages, the community of San Giorgiowas known as \\"Sotena\\" or \\"Sotera\\", as can be read in some parish archival notes that refer to a medieval repert. The first reference to Saint George in the name of the village appears on documents from the early 15th century, which indicate the community as locus Sancti Georgi Plebis Parabiaghi Duc. Mlni (it. \\"the location of Saint George, of the pieve of Parabiago, Duchy of Milan), while on maps of the Borromeo era (16th century) the town is mentioned as Cascina Sancti Georgi Plebis Parabiaghi Duc. Mlni (\\"Cassina di San Giorgio, of the pieve of Parabiago, Duchy of Milan\\"). San Giorgio was a member until 1535 of the municipality of Legnano, from which it was divided after the administrative reform of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After the Italian unification, following the enactment of the royal decree N¬∞941, on 23 October 1862, the municipality took the name \\"San Giorgio _su Legnano_ \\" to distinguish it from other municipalities of the same name.  History  = From Prehistory to Middle Age = In Prehistory the sangiorgese territory was covered by moorland. It was therefore an area where only bushes grew spontaneously, given the poor fertility of the soil. Over the centuries, thanks to the fertilization work of local farmers and the construction of artificial canals in the surrounding areas, the sangiorgese territory has been made arable. Once vast areas were cultivated and the flora of the wooded areas was composed mainly of oaks, hornbeams, chestnuts, common hazels, planes, ashes, poplars, elms, maples and alders. Roman-era finds (1st century BC ‚Äì 1st century A.D.) found in San Giorgio su Legnano in 2004 in via Trento The oldest archaeological records found in the territory of San Giorgio su Legnano are made up of Roman necropolises, the dating of which corresponds to the imperial age (1st century BC-4th century). The oldest tombs are strongly affected by Celtic influence, as the Romanization process is not yet complete. The first documented naming the sangiorgese community is to an inscription carved on some bricks dated 1393 that were found during some excavations at the Church of Santissimo Crocifisso carried out in 1769, as evidenced by some notes in the San Giorgio su Legnano parish archive: In English this archive text means: \\"this Church, having been landed in the refabrication of a new one in 1769, found two large bricks on the foundations on which Count Giorgio Giulini writer read the following inscription: 1393 ‚Äì May 26 ‚Äì is the first church built in this Sotena Commune in Glory of God and Saint George and was consecrated by the Reverend Archbishop\\". Thus, originally, the sangiorgese community was called Sotena or Sotera and the aforementioned church, now no longer existing and later replaced by the Church of Santissimo Crocifisso, turns out to be the oldest temple of San Giorgio that has been traced. A widespread folk etymology of the word Sotera, which ran among the inhabitants of the area, would like this term to be a reference to the allusion to the Roman necropolis (\\"underground\\": in the legnanese dialect sota t√®ra). The \\"Casa della Regina\\" (en. \\"Queen's House\\"), the oldest building in the municipality A view of the Parco castello in Legnano. In the background you can see the district of Costa San Giorgio belonging to comune of Legnano, while in the foreground is visible part of the escarpment that may have been the scene of the Battle of Legnano. The territory of the municipality of San Giorgio su Legnano is located beyond the district of Costa San Giorgio Apart from this inscription, there is no written news of the sangiorgese community of the Middle Ages. In the register of churches of the Liber Notitiae Sanctorum Mediolani of Geoffrey da Bussero, which describes the religious context of the Milanese area between the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century, San Giorgio is not yet present. In this historical period, San Giorgio su Legnano was therefore a small group of houses that did not yet have its own church; the first religious building in the community to be traced is the church mentioned above, which was consecrated in 1393. The only tangible evidence of the medieval San Giorgio is a sixth-door window, with a terracotta edge, present in a building overlooking the main square, the so-called Casa della regina (en. \\"Queen's House\\"), which is perhaps the oldest building in the country; on this dwelling, until the 1930s there was a coat of arms indicating the belonging of the building to the Visconti and that was taken away by an antique dealer: then the traces were lost. The Battle of Legnano may have also been fought on the territory of San Giorgio su Legnano. One of the chronicles of the famous battle (May 29, 1176), the Annales of Cologne, contains information indicating where the Carroccio was probably, and therefore where plausibly the battle would be fought: so that no warrior could withdraw, the Lombardi \\"aut vincere aut mori parati, grandi fossa suum exercitum circumdederunt\\", i.e. \\"ready to win or die in the field, placed their army inside a large pit\\". This would suggest that the Carroccio was placed on the edge of a steep slope, so that the imperial cavalry, whose arrival was expected along the course of the Olona river, would be forced to storm the center of the army of the Lombard League going up the hollowing. Considering the phases of the battle, this could mean that the famous battle may have also been fought on sangiorgese soil near the Costa San Giorgio, quartier belonging to municipality of Legnano, or on the territory of today's San Martino, another quartier belonging to municipality of Legnano, not being detectable, in other parts of the area, a hollow with these characteristics. Federico Barbarossa's army then came to the other side, from Borsano: this forced the municipal fanties to resist around the Carroccio, since they had the escape road barred by the Olona river, which they had behind them. Popular legend has it that in those days a tunnel connected San Giorgio at the castle of Legnano, and that through this tunnel the emperor Federico Barbarossa managed to escape and save himself after the defeat in battle. In the 20th century, during some excavations, trunks of a very ancient tunnel were actually found. The first, not far from San Giorgio su Legnano, was explored by one of the workers who brought it back to light. The worker was dissuaded from exploration after walking five or six meters, due to a breath of wind that extinguished the candle. A second section towards Legnano was discovered and immediately obstructed by the municipal administration for safety reasons.Le pubblicazioni de' \\"Il Belvedere\\" ‚Äì San Giorgio su Legnano ‚Äì Cenni storici ‚Äì con il patrocinio dell'Amministrazione comunale In addition, during excavations carried out in 2014 at the castle of Legnano, the entrance to another secret gallery was identified. In April 1273, Napoleone and Francesco della Torre welcomed king Edward I of England and Eleanor of Castile to Milan on their return from a trip to the Middle East. After taking leave of the Della Torre, the royals were taken to the castle of Legnano, where they stopped for one night. A popular legend, however, claims that the royals, on the way back, stayed overnight at San Giorgio su Legnano in the so-called \\"Queen's House\\". On the documents of the time, the event is described, citing the fact that the English royals had been housed \\"a Santo Georgio near Legnano\\". = From Middle Age to 18th century = Villa Parravicini In the Middle Ages the community of Sotena, like the nearby Legnano, was on the border between the Seprio peasants (whose capital was Castelseprio) and Burgaria (probably under the hegemony of Parabiago), two counties dependent on the Lombardy Brand, which was a territorial division from the Longobards and Franks. At the time, the community depended on both the civil and religious aspects of the Pieve of Parabiago. Since the 16th century, San Giorgio had a mayor, even at the time a representative of the community. The mayor was flanked by a chancellor whose duties were similar to those of the municipal secretary in the contemporary Italian order. Among other tasks, the chancellor kept the municipal archive in his own home. In 1558, as shown by the Spanish register, the municipality consisted of eleven courtyards. At that time San Giorgio was therefore a small village. One of the defining aspects of The history of San Giorgio in the 17th century was the infeudation. During this century the Spanish government auctioned off many land where the buyer, who had become a feudalist in this way, had the prerogative to boast political, economic and social rights to the fiefdom. Communities had the opportunity to redeem the land by paying a fee that was set based on the number of families in the community. San Giorgio secured the ransom in 1648 by taking on a debt of 3,000 lire with Francesco Castelli, a landowner. However, two years of poor harvests prevented the sangiorgese community from repaying the money. For this reason the sangiorgesi asked Camillo Castelli, son of Francesco, who had since died, to be unfaithful. The infeudation took place on 10 November 1656 for a sum of 3,430 lire. The sangiorgese community remained a fiefdom of the Castelli until 1780, when, with the death of Cardinal Giuseppe Castelli, the last descendant of the house, the debt was extinguished. Palazzo Lucini Arborio Mella In 1706 the Austrians took over from the Spanish as rulers of the Duchy of Milan. Among the initiatives promoted by the new government was the preparation of a register that was characterized by having much more detailed parameters than the previous ones. In addition to the precise measurement of all real estate, houses and land, a map was also made for each municipality of the Duchy. For the first time, the properties of the Catholic Church, which until then had been tax-exempt, were also recorded. Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, issued a decree establishing a working group, whose task was to accurately survey the municipalities belonging to his Lombard domains. In the case of San Giorgio, the determination of the size of the territory began on November 20, 1721 thanks to a team of detectors and designers led by surveyor Benito Corradini. In addition to the size of the municipality, all the inhabitants were registered and cataloged all the real estate properties. It took eight days to complete the work. The product was a 1:2000 scale map showing the real estate (land and buildings), as well as the boundaries of the municipality. A copy of this map is still preserved at the town hall and also accurately shows the silhouettes of the buildings. The map shows the name given by the sangiorgesi to the various terrains, a denomination from the oral tradition. This map was complemented by a document, called \\"summary\\", where the various real estate properties were listed, with the measurement and destination of the land. The inhabitants of San Giorgio su Legnano, as of March 16, 1730, were 777 and resided in 60 courtyards. There were 58 owners of real estate, but 11 of them owned as many as 92% of the municipality's land. According to this register, San Giorgio had an extension of 3,133 Milanese pertiche. = From 19th century to 21st century = Historical center in San Giorgio su Legnano In Napoleonic times, from an administrative point of view, the municipality of San Giorgio was suppressed and incorporated in the neighboring municipality of Canegrate. He was a member of the aforementioned municipality from November 4, 1809, to November 8, 1811. Agricultural crops were very varied. The main crops were cereals (millet and wheat), vine and mulberry, which is the basis of the breeding of silkworms. In addition to the cereal crop, the economy of San Giorgio su Legnano was also based on livestock farming. The agricultural contract spread in these centuries in the Altomilanese was that of the sharecropper. Vine was the most common crop in the area. In 1723, in fact, about 70% of the sangiorgese territory was cultivated with vineyards. The vine was so common that, as recently as 1855, San Giorgio su Legnano was among the communities where the fraction of the land worked in vineyards was predominant. On the social and economic front, this period was characterized by the profound transformation of the sangiorgese production system. It went from an agricultural economy to an industrial one. In the second half of the 19th century, the first small proto- industrial activities appeared. According to a document from 1872, two protoindustries for the treatment of silk were based in San Giorgio su Legnano, one for processing and the other for twisting. Overall, they employed about 200 people, mostly women. According to a written testimony of 1891, among the proto-industrial activities, a detached headquarters of the Kramer & C. plant in Legnano appeared and a craft activity for the production of spirits appeared. Historical center in San Giorgio su Legnano Former town hall in San Giorgio su Legnano The process of industrialization that led to the gradual transformation of the sangiorgese economy was accelerated by two natural disasters that put local agriculture in crisis: cryptogamy, a disease that affected the vine, and nosematosis, an epidemic that damaged the cocoons of silkworms. For the first infection, which appeared between 1851 and 1852, the result in Lombardy was the rapid fall in the amount of wine produced. The hectolitres of wine produced rose from 1,520,000 in 1838 to 550,000 in 1852. The final blow to wine production came from two other diseases of the vine that, between 1879 and 1890, affected the plant: the peronospora and the phylloxera. Following these epidemics, the wineries in San Giorgio su Legnano disappeared for good and the peasants concentrated their efforts on the production of cereals and the breeding of silkworms. In other wine areas the problem was solved by grafting species of vines immune to the disease (American grapes). However, this did not happen in San Giorgio: in 1911 about 80% of the agricultural land of San Giorgio su Legnano was destined for the cultivation of mulberries, with the cultivation of the vine having completely disappeared. Shortly after the spread of the disease of the vine, an infection of the silkworm, nosematosis, appeared. It was also called p√©brin because it was revealed by small dark spots that covered the body of the bug. It was a disease that had never appeared before, and was considerably more dangerous than the kick that for centuries ruined part of the crop. The mulberry culture did not follow the fate of viticulture. The end of the cultivation of silkworms was in fact less rapid than that of viticulture. In San Giorgio, mulberries were cultivated until the early part of the 20th century. In the second part of the 19th century, Europe was hit by an agricultural crisis involving cereal crops. This was due to the spread of American grains at competitive prices on the markets. In fact, large areas of the American Middle West were destined for cultivation. In addition, thanks to technological advancement, there was a marked decrease in the cost of transport by sea. The effect was a deep crisis that affected cereal crops in Europe. This juncture, which reached its peak in the 1880s, characterized the agriculture of the old continent until the beginning of the 20th century. At this point the economic structure of San Giorgio su Legnano changed completely into an industrial system. In 1911, the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce released data from the first statistical survey of industrial plants. Out of 3,015 sangiorgesi, almost 50% worked in the industrial sector. To make the idea more precise of the economic system would be enough to mention the animals present in 1937 in the stables of sangiorgesi, compared to almost 3,900 inhabitants: 17 oxen, 31 calves, 126 cows, 46 horses, 3 donkeys, 1 mule, 1 hinny, 12 pigs and 11 goats.Archivio comunale del comune di San Giorgio su Legnano To complete the picture around the agricultural economy of the sangiorgese community, in the early 1940s, the cultivated fields provided about 1,800 tons of wheat, 400 rye and 80 oats. At the turn of the 1950s and 1960s there was the golden age of the sangiorgese industry, mainly related to the textile and mechanical industries. In the decades that followed, there was a slow decline caused by competition from textiles from developing countries. The crisis progressively worsened, damaging the economy, employment and industrial fabric, that resized. These processes continue to this day. Agriculture, marginal in its impact on the production system, is practiced in the few areas free of construction and infrastructure. These soils are grown from cereals, mainly wheat and maize. San Giorgio su Legnano, like the whole surrounding area, is still among the most developed and industrialized areas of Italy.  Main sights  = Religious architecture = Church of Beata Vergine Assunta In San Giorgio su Legnano there are two churches, a subsidiary and a parish one. Prior to the construction of the latter, the community referred to a church before 1750 and later demolished and also called by the same name as the modern parish. The parish church of San Giorgio su Legnano, Church of Beata Vergine Assunta, that is dedicated to Assumption of Mary, was consecrated on 23 April 1935 by the Archbishop of Milan, Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster. The domed octagonal church is an example of a Bramantes-inspired Renaissance style, easily inferred from the central plant. On each of the eight sides open the corresponding side chapels and the presbytery, which develops in depth. The two side chapels, one of the Sacred Heart and the other of Our Lady are increased, forming a circle-shaped outline closed by a dome. Another peculiarity of the church is the use of bricks of clear Lombard derivation. The subsidiary church, dedicated to Saint George, is known as the Church of Santissimo Crocifisso. It is located in the place where the oldest religious building in the community was located. After the construction of 1703, it was called a Chiesa Nuova (en. \\"New Church\\"). In 1933 it was called the Chiesa del Santissimo Crocifisso. Church of Santissimo Crocifisso The first documented reports on the old parish Church of Beata Vergine Assunta date back to 1750, the year of its expansion. The temple, in the Baroque style, had a single aisle that was complemented by side chapels. The apse was boasted of frescoes. The facade had a simple invoice, and was decorated with lesene. On the left of the facade was the bell tower, while on the right was the oratory of Saint Louis. The former parishioner finished his religious duties in October 1934. It was deconsecrated by archbishop's decree on 24 February 1936 and was sold by the parish on 9 January 1948. It was demolished in 1974. Madonna di Baldeur chapel was built in the area where the dead of the plague of 1630 were buried. Inside was visible the image of Our Lady with the Child. Every year a procession was made from San Giorgio to the chapel in commemoration of the dead from the plague, and a party followed the ceremony. It was demolished in 1986 for the construction of a road. = Civil architecture = Kindergarten in San Giorgio su Legnano In San Giorgio su Legnano there are some buildings of historical interest. The oldest, among those owned by the municipality, is the former town hall of San Giorgio su Legnano. Born as a home of elementary schools and municipal offices and situated in via Gerli, it was inaugurated in 1892. It also housed classrooms until 1929, when the new schools were inaugurated. He served as a town hall until 1992. The building that houses the Circolo familiare was built in the early 20th century having a commercial function. Since 1936 he has been doing social activities. Another notable property is the kindergarten, which opened on 15 July 1909. There are several works designed by the famous architect Of sangiorgese Gino Maggioni in his home country. More specifically, they are the Monumento ai caduti (en. \\"monument to the fallen\\": opened in 1921), the cemetery (1928) and elementary schools (1929). Since 1992, the school plexus designed by Gino Maggioni has been used as a municipal seat. There are also three noble villas in the municipality, namely Villa Parravicini, Palazzo Lucini Arborio Mella and Villa Bizzozzero. The monument to the fallen and the current town hall of San Giorgio su Legnano The Villa Parravicini has undergone several changes over the centuries that have radically modificated the appearance. This building already existed in 1584 and was home to a nobleman owned by Ludovico Crivelli. In a document dated 1655 we can read: In English this text means: \\"Noble house placed in the said place of the Cassina di San Giorgio with different places on earth and doves doi, porches, stable, polar, court, common well. The villa has an English landscape garden, which covers about 9,300 square meters. Originally, the green area had a larger extent. Orio Vergani denoundes the house, calling it: The frescoes of the hall of representation of Palazzo Lucini Arborio Mella, the work of Biagio Bellotti, in a vintage photo Park of Campaccio In English this text means: \\"a villa that has characteristics of simplicity and austerity typical of the manor houses of the area\\". The Palazzo Lucini Arborio Mella, whose date of construction is unknown, in the early 18th century belonged to Count Francesco Lucini, who was at that time the largest landowner of the municipality. The portal and a wrought-iron balcony on the low front of the old house are valuable. Later it passed to the accounts Arborio Mella and was renovated during the 18th century, as evidenced by the vault of the great salon frescoed in 1750 by Biagio Bellotti. The Mella accounts decided to sell the building in 1922. The historic garden of the palace was created in the 19th century and sold to the parish for the construction of the new parish church. The building was divided into several properties. A portion of this building was the first seat of the town hall of the municipality of San Giorgio su Legnano (from 1924 to 1929). Today part of the building, owned by the municipality, houses a nursery. In the centre of San Giorgio su Legnano you can still see also the Villa Bizzozzero, house owned by Carlo Bizzozero, one of the largest owners of rural and real estate of San Giorgio of the 18th century. This villa had a garden, overlooking piazza Mazzini. = Natural areas = Villa Parravicini has an English landscape garden, which covers about 9,300 square meters and includes more than 30 species of trees and more than 15 species of shrubs. Built in the mid-19th century, it is bound by the superintendence of environmental and architectural goods along with the manor house with their respective rustics as \\"natural beauty\\" (by ministerial decree of 25 June 1958). Originally it had a larger extension and also included an area now occupied by modern cottages. The Parco Parravicini is throughout the Legnanese the only area that has the particular botanical features that have led to its protection. In the municipality there is another notable area, the park of Campaccio, where the eponymous cross-country race is run.  Demographics  = Ethnic groups = As of December 31, 2016, foreign nationals living in the municipality of San Giorgio su Legnano (ISTAT data) acombined 596. The most represented nationalities were: # Albania, 108 # Morocco, 91 # Ukraine, 51 # Romania, 48 # Pakistan, 42 # Per√π, 21 # India, 20 # Senegal, 20 = Religion = The patron saint is Saint George. The majority of the population is Catholic Church. The immigration of EU and non-EU citizens has led to the establishment of large Orthodox, Muslims and Christian minorities. There is one Catholic parish in the municipality that belong to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan, the Parrocchia Beata Vergine Assunta.  Transportation  San Giorgio su Legnano is lined by the provincial road N¬∞ 12, which is the most important road infrastructure present in the municipality. The intercity transport of San Giorgio su Legnano is carried out with scheduled services operated by Movibus.  Economy  Church of Santissimo Crocifisso's gardens Agriculture has been San Giorgio's main livelihood for centuries. With the advent of industrialization, in this role, it gave way to manufacturing activities. In the 21st century it is not an important activity for the economy of San Giorgio su Legnano; it is carried out in a limited part of the municipality, south of the town, which is still free from construction and infrastructure. The first Sangiorgese industries arose in the second half of the 19th century. From the beginning of the 20th century, the municipality was involved in a process of industrialization. The companies operating in San Giorgio su Legnano in this historical context were mainly textiles and mechanics. The sangiorgese industries reached the height of development in the 1950s and 1960s, after which there was a period of constant involution. This crisis, which led to the partial deindustrialization of San Giorgio su Legnano, continued in the following decades compromising the industrial fabric, employment and, more generally, the economic system of the municipality. Many companies went bankrupt, mainly in the textile industry, and many others experienced downsizing. This partial deindustrialization of the sangiorgese territory continues into the 21st century.  Culture  = Languages and literature = Around Legnano it's spoken Legnanese dialect, dialect of the Lombard language (belonging to the western branch), spoken by about 30% of the population of the area where it is spread. Like all Western Lombard dialects, legnanese is a Romance language derived from Latin with a Celtic substrate and longobard superstratum. In Legnanese dialect there are those who find traces of the languages of the peoples prior to the Latinization of the region, in particular the ancient Ligurian, although the data on the actual influence of this linguistic substrate are few and of varying interpretation. The linguistic influence of the Celts on the local speakers of Altomilanese was conspicuous, so much so that even today the dialect of Legnano is classified as \\"Gallo-Italic\\". However, it was the Roman domination, which supplanted the Celtic one, that shaped the local idiom spoken in Legnanese, so much so that the lexicon and grammar of this dialect is of Romance derivation. = Sport = The Unione Sportiva Sangiorgese s a multi-sports company founded in 1922 that deals with athletics, volleyball, basketball, skiing and hiking. The basketball team played in the Serie B championship. The company organizes the cross-country race called Campaccio, an international event born in 1957 that takes place on a course of about 12 km. The name of the race comes from campasc, which in the Legnanese dialect means \\"uncultivated field\\". In fact, in the first editions, the route of the race winded through the nearby roads of the agricultural area of the municipality: later it was moved to a public park, the Parco del Campaccio. The Campaccio is attended by internationally renowned athletes, including Olympic and world champions: it is therefore one of the most important events of its kind in Italy and is included in the international Cross Country Permit circuit of the European Athletic Association. San Giorgio su Legnano hosted the 2006 European Cross Country Championships, organized by the Unione Sportiva Sangiorgese on 10 December. The men's title was won by Mohamed Farah and the women's title by Tetyana Holovchenko. In this edition of the championship, the races for athletes under 23 were introduced for the first time.  Education  In San Giorgio su Legnano there are four public school plexuses: a first grade secondary school, a primary school and a kindergarten.

Hannaford attended public schools and graduated from Farmer's College, Cincinnati, where he studied architecture. Hannaford opened an office in 1857 and in 1887 formed the firm of Samuel Hannaford & Sons. At the time of his death, he was director of the Ohio Mechanics' Institute.

The castle was destroyed or burnt several times, but was rebuilt on each occasion. The last reconstruction dates from 1370. It was commissioned by Bernab√≤ Visconti, who was later imprisoned there until his death. On 23 October 1404, the castle was captured by Paolo Colleoni, father of the important condottiere Bartolomeo. The Visconti general Francesco Bussone recaptured it, partially demolishing it and starting its decline. In the 19th century it was used as a quarry for the construction of the Arena di Milano.

Sueter was a left- handed batsman and, with his contemporary William Yalden, one of the two most famous wicket-keepers of the 18th century. Sueter and Yalden are the earliest players to be recognised as \\"wicketkeeper/batsmen\\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Sueter played mainly for Hampshire but in his closing seasons he represented Surrey, probably because of temporary residence in the county, though he evidently returned to Hambledon after he finished playing. Sueter was a carpenter and builder by trade and Arthur Haygarth recorded that above the Hambledon church door in the 1860s was affixed a plaque saying: \\"Thomas Sueter and Richard Flood, builders, 1788\\".Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826, Lillywhite, 1862 Sueter began playing in the 1760s and made 67 known first-class appearances from the 1772 season to the 1790 season. He is said \\"to have been the first (or one of the first) who departed from the custom of the old players, who deemed it a heresy to leave the crease for the ball; but he would get in at it, hit it straight off and straight on, and egad it went as if it had been fired.\\"Ashley Mote, John Nyren's \\"The Cricketers of my Time\\", Robson, 1998 Sueter was also reckoned an excellent judge of a short run. Like George Leer, Sueter was a fine singer and he belonged to the choir at his parish church. When he died, according to Haygarth, he left behind him a sovereign in order that an anthem should be sung in the church over his coffin; and this was done. Haygarth records that Sueter‚Äôs tombstone was still standing in Hambledon churchyard in 1858 with the following inscription: :::::Sacred to the memory of THOMAS SUETER, :::::who departed this life the 17th day of February, 1827, aged 77 years References Further reading * H.

Record warmest and coldest is based on a 112-year period of records (1895‚Äì2006). The 1936 North American heat wave was one of the most severe heat waves in the modern history of North America. It took place in the middle of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl of the 1930s and caused catastrophic human suffering and an enormous economic toll. The death toll exceeded 5,000, and huge numbers of crops were destroyed by the heat and lack of moisture. Many state and city record high temperatures set during the 1936 heat wave stood until the summer 2012 North American heat wave. The 1936 heat wave followed one of the coldest winters on record. Events Summer (June‚ÄìAugust) 1936 precipitation, in inches. Record wettest and driest is based on a 112-year period of records (1895‚Äì2006). The heat wave started in late June, when temperatures across the United States exceeded . The Midwest experienced some of the highest June temperatures on record. Drought conditions worsened. In the Northeast, temperatures climbed to the mid 90s ¬∞F (around 35 ¬∞C). The South and West started to heat up as well, and also experienced drought. The heat wave began to extend into Canada. Moderate to extreme drought covered the entire continent. The dry and exposed soil contributed directly to the heat (as happens normally in desert areas), as the extreme heat entered the air by radiation and direct contact. July was the peak month, in which temperatures reached all-time records--many of which still stood as of 2012. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures reached , which remains North Dakota's record. In Ohio, temperatures reached , which nearly tied the previous record set in 1934. The states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Nebraska, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and New Jersey also experienced record high temperatures. The provinces of Ontario and Manitoba set still- standing record highs above . Chicago Midway Airport recorded or higher temperatures on eight consecutive days from July 7‚Äì14, 1936. Later that summer in downstate Illinois, at Mount Vernon, the temperature surpassed for 18 days running from August 12‚Äì29, 1936. Some stations in the American Midwest reported minimum temperatures at or above , such as at Lincoln, Nebraska, on July 25, 1936; the next and most recent time this is known to have happened is during a similar, but far less intense, heat wave in late June 1988 that produced a handful of minimums. The highest nightly low temperature outside the Desert Southwest was at Atchison, Kansas, during the heat wave of July 1934. August was the warmest month on record for five states. Many experienced long stretches of daily maximum temperatures or warmer. Drought conditions worsened in some locations. Other states were only slightly warmer than average. The heat wave and drought largely ended in September, though many states were still drier and warmer than average. Many farmers' summer harvests were destroyed. Grounds and lawns remained parched. Seasonable temperatures returned in the autumn. Effects As many as 5,000 heat-related deaths were reported in the United States, and 780 direct and 400 indirect deaths in Canada. Many people suffered from heat stroke and heat exhaustion, particularly the elderly. Unlike today, air conditioning was in the early stages of development and was therefore absent from houses and commercial buildings. Many of the deaths occurred in high-population-density areas of Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Toronto, and other urban areas. Farmers across the continent saw crop failure, causing corn and wheat prices to rise quickly. Droughts and heat waves were common in the 1930s. The 1930s (the Dust Bowl years) are remembered as the driest and warmest decade for the United States, and the summer of 1936 featured the most widespread and destructive heat wave to occur in the Americas in centuries.

Ellet Ram Fleet She was fitted out as a ram at Pittsburgh and headed down the Ohio River 29 April to join a fleet of rams which Ellet was organizing to counter the Confederate River Defense Fleet. This group of southern rams had been fitted out in the lower Mississippi and threatened to emulate the dreaded southern ironclad ram Virginia in routing wooden hulled Union ships. On 10 May the Confederate flotilla made a spirited attack on Union gunboats and mortar schooners at Plum Point Bend, Tennessee, sinking and forcing the Mound City aground. A fortnight later all but one of the rams had joined the Union flotilla above Fort Pillow ready for action. As the ram fleet and Western Flotilla prepared to attack, General Halleck's capture of Corinth, Mississippi, on 30 May cut the railway lines which supported the Confederate positions at Forts Pillow and Randolph, forcing the South to abandon these river strongholds. Battle of Memphis The Confederacy charged its River Defense Fleet, the only remaining operational group of southern warships worthy of the name fleet, with the task of stemming the Union advance down the Mississippi. The South's strategy called for a naval stand at Memphis, Tennessee. On the evening of 6 June, Flag Officer Davis arrived above the city with his ironclads. Before dawn the next morning the Union ships raised their anchors and dropped downstream by their sterns. Half an hour later the Confederate rams got underway from the Memphis levee and opened fire. At this point Colonel Ellet ordered his rams to steam through the line of Flag Officer Davis' slower ironclads and to run down the Confederate steamers. His flagship Queen of the West headed straight for Colonel Lovell, the leading southern ram. A moment before the two ships crashed, one of Colonel Lovell's engines failed causing her to veer. The Union ram's reinforced prow smashed into Colonel Lovell's side, ripping a fatal hole in her hull. When Queen of the West pulled free from Lovell, she ran aground on the Arkansas shore. Meanwhile, Union ram Monarch crashed into foundering Lovell with a second blow which sent her to the river bottom with all but five of her crew. By then Davis' ironclads had steamed within easy range of the southern ships and began to score with the effective fire. In the ensuing close action, the Confederate River Defense Fleet was destroyed; all of its ships, except the Van Dorn, were either captured, sunk, or grounded. Mingo and Lioness, ordered to protect the rear of Ellet's column, reached the scene of battle after the rout was over. Memphis surrendered to Flag Officer Davis, and the pressure of relentless naval power placed another important segment of the Mississippi firmly under Union control, an open wound in the Confederate heartland. During the next few days, the rams took on cannon to prepare to fight Confederate ships which they could not reach with their deadly prows. Battle of Vicksburg On 19 June, Mingo and four sister rams got underway downstream from Memphis. A week later, after the rams had moved down the river to a point just above Vicksburg, Ellet sent a party across the peninsula, formed by a bend in the river opposite the hillside town, to tell Farragut, just below the fortress, that the Union had won control of the upper Mississippi. Farragut ran the gauntlet past Vicksburg's guns 28 June, and Flag Officer Davis joined him above the city with the Western Flotilla 1 July. The meeting of the fresh water and salt water squadrons helped buoy morale throughout the North, but control of the river which it implied could not be realized until the South lost its Gibraltar-like fortress at Vicksburg. A year of seemingly endless labor and bitter fighting awaited the champions of the Union cause before President Lincoln could write: \\"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea...\\" On 15 July, the Confederate ironclad ram Arkansas, built at Memphis and completed at Yazoo, Mississippi, raced down the Yazoo River and fought through the combined Union squadrons to shelter under the guns at Vicksburg. At the first sight of Arkansas, Lancaster tried to ram the southern ship; but when she was a mere 100 yards from her quarry, a broadside from the ironclad opened up her lines and made her unmanageable. As Lancaster drifted downstream, Queen of the West caught her and towed her to safety. The following day ram Mingo came alongside and took Lancaster to Memphis for repairs. In the coming months Mingo and her sister rams worked tirelessly to control the river and to help capture Vicksburg. In November she sank accidentally at Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

Fesser, oiler, 17 years at sea: \\"We got a big job to do until this war is won. We will keep them sailing until the end. Then we have got time for holidays.\\" October 14, 1944. An oiler (also known as a \\"greaser\\") is a worker whose main job is to oil machinery. In previous eras there were oiler positions in various industries, including maritime work (naval and commercial), railroading, steelmaking, and mining. Today most such positions have been eliminated through technological change; lubrication tends to require less human intervention, so that workers seldom have oiling as a principal duty. In the days of ubiquitous plain bearings, oiling was often a job description in and of itself. Today, shipping is the economic segment that most thoroughly retains the notion of the oiler as a separate position. On a merchant ship, an oiler is an unlicensed rate of the engineering department. The position is of the junior rate in the engine room of a ship. The oiler is senior only to a wiper. Once a sufficient amount of sea time is acquired, the Oiler can apply to take a series of courses/examinations to become certified as an engineer. As a member of the engineering department, the oiler operates and maintains the propulsion and other systems on board the vessel. Oilers also deal with the \\"hotel\\" facilities on board, notably the sewage, lighting, air conditioning, and water systems. They assist bulk fuel transfers and require training in firefighting and first aid. Moreover, oilers help facilitate operation of the ship's boats and other nautical tasks ‚Äì especially with cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems. However, the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers. Tools * Oil cans (which themselves are sometimes referred to as \\"oilers\\") * Grease guns * Rags and brushes  Legal requirements  Under international conventions and agreements specifically the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (or STCW), all oilers who sail internationally are documented by their respective countries. Recent changes to the STCW no longer refer to specific rates such as oiler. The terms Able Seafarer-Engine and Able Seafarer-Deck are now used to refer to unlicensed positions on vessels engaged in international trade. In the United States, Title 46 (Shipping) of the Code of Federal Regulations governs who is eligible to sail as an oiler in National trade. = United States = A person has to have a Merchant Mariner's Document issued by the United States Coast Guard in order to be employed as an oiler in the United States Merchant Marine. = Canada = To work as an oiler in the Canadian Coast Guard, it is required that the individual holds an engine room rating certificate. In order to obtain this certificate the applicant must first have no less than six months of documented sea time working under the supervision of a watch keeping engineer. The applicant must then go to a Transport Canada Office and have a written and oral exam before the certificate is issued. It is also required for all sea going personnel to have MED (marine emergency duty) certificates which can be obtained by taking courses through a college approved for training. Oilers working for the Canadian Coast Guard have various duties, some of which include, performing regular maintenance of the ship's engines and other equipment, assisting the engineers with the repair and overhaul of the ship‚Äôs engines and equipment, making regular rounds of the engine room and designated spaces and alerting the engineer on watch of any problems noted. The oiler is also required to keep the engine room clean, tidy and freshly painted. They are the most junior crewmember of the engineering department in the Canadian Coast Guard.

The role of a wiper consists of cleaning the engine spaces and machinery, and assisting the engineers as directed. The position is an apprenticeship to become an oiler. In modern times, a wiper is required to work on a ship for a specific amount of time, gaining what is referred to as \\"sea time.\\" In the United States Merchant Marine, in order to be occupied as a wiper a person has to have a Merchant Mariner's Document and STCW certificate issued by the United States Coast Guard. Because of international conventions and agreements, all wipers who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries. Railroad workers who performed similar jobs were also known as wipers, or in the UK as \\"cleaners\\".  Duties  As a wiper aboard a United States Merchant Marine vessel or any International Maritime Organization (IMO) certified merchant shipping vessel, the diversity of operational duties is inherent and must be approached as such. Typically, with little experience, a wiper may work under the close supervision of trained and qualified engineers of the engineering department belonging to the vessel. Taking commands and directions from the 1st Assistant Engineer, the Chief Engineers‚Äô foremost subordinate, the wiper is in charge of, but not wholly responsible for, maintenance ranging from chipping in the bilges to painting of the overhead in the machinery spaces. Additional duties include assisting of licensed engineers, filling in for Qualified Members of the Engine Department (QMED) when necessary, and standing as a member of the watch team but not assigned watches. Duties while serving day work, typically while in port or underway, involve cleaning and degreasing of equipment, greasing of parts, and oversight of all machinery spaces in terms of cleanliness. The Wiper position is the highest-ranking unlicensed position in the engineering department. The Wiper position is designated for apprentices to the engineering department where a basic working knowledge of plant layout is learned. Work to be performed by a wiper is typically of low-stakes nature and is meant to create a work-positive environment where sea time may be secured towards licensure. As the typical wiper is aboard a vessel and underway, although they may be found in land-based operations such as railroading as well, they must be fluent in ship operations and have familiarity with safety equipment used. As the United States Merchant Marine is strict in compliance of international organization's precedent in regards to regulations on shipping, having to adhere to the standards set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), many of the same requirements can be found for vessels that do not serve under the United States Jones Act. In relation to this requirement, a wiper is to be sufficiently trained on how to carry out firefighting operations; this includes the proper donning, assembly, use, and maintenance of all equipment involved should the need arise in order to facilitate the need for all seafarers to be fluent in lifesaving procedures These requirements are mandatory and are also adhered to on an international and involuntary basis with the need to renew the very same preliminary physical and firefighting examinations found within CFR 46. The global institution responsible for mandating standards for lifesaving procedures and equipment is commonly known as the International Convention for the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS). As a crew member, it is to be noticed that a Wiper may undergo a condition known as burnout syndrome. This is where a seafarer may be overcome by increased anxiety and stress by means of poor leadership, long hours, and high-risk applications. The implications of work-related stress stemming from seafaring operations can be largely alleviated through clear communication of crew and leadership and occasionally moderation through a human resources department. For this reason, it is of medical importance that a wiper finds employment where the safety and well being of workers is held to a high standard. Seafarers and labor unions, necessitated from this occurrence, are closely related in this nature.  General Qualification and Licensure  Little paperwork and qualification is needed to secure a position as a wiper as there are very few preliminary requirements to be found internationally. The only documentation needed is a Merchant Mariners Document (MMD) or a United States approved certification as a wiper. For those looking at work internationally, an International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved document will suffice for employment and will be required for any persons not sailing in the United States; A United States MMD is not recognized by international shipping organizations. A Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) is required to apply for an MMD or a QMED program. Requirements for those applying for a QMED credential include the following: One must be at least 18 years of age, undergo a medical evaluation, pass an illicit substance screening, and be able to fluently communicate in the English language in the ways that ship duties would require. Greater detail of this process can be illustrated in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 46). By passing tests administered, an individual may claim a QMED credential and begin accruing sea time in order to apply for higher positions in the maritime industry such as the Third Assistant Engineer. Much of this same process applies for international wipers although there are minor discrepancies between the U.S. Coast Guard and other international licensure departments. This process can be greatly reduced in duration through enrollment in one of seven offered United States Coast Guard (USCG) approved and accredited maritime academies, such as California Maritime Academy and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, whose programs offer a mix of applied technologies courses and opportunities to accrue sea time. In addition, there are several international maritime academies, such as Svendborg International Maritime Academy, which specialize in the growing demands for environmental protection, the safety of workers, and the efficiency of shipping across the globe.  Union Affiliation and Organization  Union Affiliation and Jones Act mariners are closely related in terms of interaction, and the proliferation of labor unions is mainstream across the United States and the world. Seafarer's labor unions are meant to primarily protect sailors and their interests while serving as financial strongholds to support internal operations ad communication, deal in the costs of lawsuits and other court procedures, and to reward its members in various ways. The payment for these undertakings come primarily from union dues which are deducted from the paycheck of a member in the form of a percentage. Unions such as Marine Engineers‚Äô Beneficial Association (MEBA) and the Marine Firemen, Oilers, Water tenders, and Wipers Association (MFOW) are a staple of employment for those sailing in the United States. These labor unions lobby for increased rights in the workplace and establish deals between employers and workers which call for benefits of varying degree and magnitude. These benefits include guaranteed meal times, coffee breaks, overtime, medical insurance, paid vacation, and other sorts of hazard payment. The voicing of grievances is relatively commonplace in maritime labor unions, much like shore-based skilled labor operations, and protectionist legislation is deliberated during meetings, protests, lawsuits, and on occasion United States Supreme Court precedent. Unions internationally follow the same structure of deliberation between employees and employers that can serve as arenas to bid for changes from within.

He later played college basketball for the Marist Red Foxes. Biography Miles Orman is the son of Roscoe Orman, who played Miles Robinson's adopted father Gordon. Roscoe originally suggested that Gordon and Susan have a child when he first joined the show in 1974. At the time, the producers felt that it was too complicated to cast a baby to play the part. Ten years later, when Roscoe's son Miles was a year old, he revisited the idea. Roscoe remembers, \\"Caroll Spinney offhandedly said one day, 'That son of yours is so cute -- he's such a great kid -- we should bring him on the show and let him be your son.' I said that I had suggested something like that years ago but it was shot down. And he said, 'Well, you know, you could even adopt him.' That really started my wheels turning and I mentioned it to [Executive Producer] Dulcy Singer.\\" The producers were intrigued by the adoption angle, and cast Miles in the role. \\"The idea is that he'll grow up on the show -- for as long as he wants to,\\" Roscoe said in 1986. \\"He's very outgoing and friendly.

Director primacy Director primacy is a theory of the firm that was introduced by Bainbridge in an article in Northwestern University Law Review in 2003 (Vol 97 No 2). He argues that traditional firm theory is based on a false premise that the board's authority derives from the owners. He argues that while the board is appointed by the owners, the nature of the appointment is one in which the power to be exercised is not under the control of the appointing members. Once appointed then, directors are almost unfettered in their exercise of their powers. However, they are subject to overarching fiduciary responsibility which aligns their required actions with a shareholder wealth maximization principle.

The title comes from a 1947 composition by Bronislau Kaper and Ned Washington‚Äîwritten for the Hollywood film Green Dolphin Street‚Äîand later recorded by jazz musicians Miles Davis (1958), and Bill Evans (1959), among others. The film was an adaptation of the best-seller novel Green Dolphin Street (1944) by Elizabeth Goudge.  Literary themes  On Green Dolphin Street narrates the troubles, fears, dilemmas, problems and happiness of its main characters. There is an implicit feeling of nostalgia in the novel, a nostalgia for a time when everything seemed possible and life was full of hope and expectations. This, of course, also denotes the idea of disillusionment, a theme Faulkes also explores in his earlier novel, The Long White Winter. This is encapsulated by Mary and Charlie. Charlie has seemingly lost the will to live, or at least he lacks the enthusiasm that he had as a younger man. He has a depressing outlook on life, Mary recognises this sentiment and agrees that life is largely irrational‚Äîin that death takes everyone eventually, a theme explored through Mary's mother's death‚Äîbut sees hope in love. Her relationship with Frank reinvigorates her outlook. Apart from describing personal problems like drink, adultery and love, the novel also deals with the theme of politics, and political concepts like democracy and freedom. The United States is portrayed from the beginning as a territory facing problems, both internal as well as external. The Civil Rights Movement‚Äîthat causes some controversy between the characters in the first chapter‚Äîand the Cold War contribute to an unstable and threatening atmosphere. U.S. citizens are living in fear of being questioned about. The concepts of freedom and democracy are thus questioned and doubted and it seems as if the novel indirectly compares the state of affairs in the 'democratic' United States with communist Russia. The American citizens are blackmailed (Charlie), driven to commit suicide (Frank's friend, Billy Foy) and deprived of their freedom of speech (Frank).

The town is located about east of Bergamo and is situated in the Guerna river valley. The town is part of the Mountain Community of Monte Bronzone Sebino. The hills of San Fermo attract tourists for sports such as mountain biking, trekking and paragliding. History The town dates from the Middle Ages, around the year 1000. The first documented evidence of settlement was the village of Adrara, which had not yet been divided into the two existing entities. The province of Bergamo was devastated by fratricidal conflict between the Guelph and Ghibelline, which in turn created a large influx of refugees into Adrara from these remote and quiet areas. However, fighting broke out in Adrara as well and a castle was built to protect inhabitants from the incursions of violence among the villagers. During the 14th century, the territory fell under the domination of the Calepio family, who took possession of most of the valley. In the following century the arrival of the Venetian Republic put a definitive end to the factional struggles. Adrara experienced a period of peace and economic prosperity, along with a corresponding increase in population. After this time of peace, territorial conflicts emerged between the upstream parish of San Rocco and the downstream village of San Martino. In 1668, the territory of Adrara was divided into two different entities: Adrara San Rocco and Adrara San Martino. Lingering disputes took a century to resolve. The division was formalized in 1754, ending with the awarding of five ninths of the land to the community of San Rocco and the remaining four ninths to San Martino. Church The parish church was dedicated to San Rocco, and dates from 1539. This church was restored during the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. It has a long staircase outside that leads to the entrance. Inside are frescoes, among which are those made by the workshop of Francesco Capella. The Shrine of Saint Faustino and Saint Giovita, better known as the sanctuary of the dead of Bondo, was built in the fourteenth century. People Literary critic and biographical author Eugenio Donadoni was born in San Rocco in 1870.

It was erected in 1905 and designed by local architect William S. Joy The Building was originally built as a speculative office building, converted into a hotel in 1912, then back into an office building again in 1922. although there is evidence that it was occasionally a mix of both. The building closed sometime in the 1980s after being purchased by Ralph Sachs. It remained closed and was later added to the Park Avenue Historic District. despite being the oldest hotel in Detroit, it was demolished in 2013 for neglect. A parking lot currently sits on this site. History The Hotel Charlevoix was erected in 1905 and designed by architect William S. Joy. Originally designed in the Beaux Arts style with a light bay in the centre, giving the appearance that the building was divided in two. The Building was originally built as an office building, converted into a hotel in 1912, then back into an office building again in 1922. although there is evidence that it was at one point a mix of both. it was a cheaper alternative to the other ones in the area by Lew Tuller. The details were removed in 1953 leaving it bare. The building closed sometime in the 1980s after being purchased by Ralph Sachs. Demolition The moment Sachs had been waiting for finally came in March 2012 when several bricks fell from the front facade of the Charlevoix, hitting a parked car below and Sachs requested demolition. On June 13, 2012, the City Historic District Commission held a hearing on the proposed demolition of the Charlevoix. Because the building was in the Park Avenue Historic District, the commission would need to approve the demolition. Sachs was not at the hearing, but his representatives urged the commission to allow for the building to come down, citing the falling bricks; the fact that the building is a frequent target of squatters and urban explorers; the building lacks any historical details; and that Sachs had been unable to find a developer or buyer for the building. They also said that Sachs didn't have the financial means to rehab, secure or demolish the building himself. Sachs' representatives proved neither that he couldn't afford to pay for demolition or mothballing the building nor that the building was in imminent danger of collapse, the HDC denied the permission to demolish the building. Sachs was given 15 days to submit a plan for the structure. It's unclear what would happen if Sachs doesn't comply. About 7:30 a.m. June 23, 2013, workers took down the Charlevoix in one fell swoop. After cutting the steel I-beams supporting the old hotel, cables were used to bring the building down upon itself. In seconds, the Historic 1905 hotel was nothing but a pile of bricks.

The Chief Executive Officer and President is Dr. Mark Eastburg, appointed December, 2006. Pine Rest is one of the five largest free- standing behavioral health providers in the U.S., offering services including addiction treatment and recovery, extensive child and adolescent programs, postpartum and other perinatal mood disorder treatment, senior care services, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (TMS). In addition to the main campus in Grand Rapids, Pine Rest also has just under 20 outpatient locations throughout Michigan and two in Iowa. Pine Rest's inpatient hospitalization program is licensed for 200 beds, with residential services for adolescent boys and girls; older adults coping with dementia; those needing addiction services; those in need of sub-acute detoxification program services; and developmentally disabled persons. Pine Rest seeks to incorporate faith and healing into the care of patients: it has an active chaplain service to offer spiritual care to the patients. In addition, Clinical Pastoral Education is offered through Pine Rest. History It was founded in 1910 as the Christian Psychopathic Hospital. In 2007 the hospital opened the Gerald & Jane-Ann Postma Center for Worship and Education, a $3.7 million training center targeted at nursing, behavior health and pastoral students and Pine Rest staff members. With more than , the center can accommodate groups of as many as 500 people in five multi-purpose rooms. It also houses a chapel for campus residents and for training pastoral education students. An art gallery, named for Bruce and Mary Leep is inside the Postma Center. In 2008, Pine Rest opened the InterActions Residential Treatment Center at its main campus. The secured, 16-bed residential treatment center was designed for helping adults with chronic and/or persistent mental illness, including those with co-occurring mild development disabilities and mental illnesses, or with a mental illness and substance abuse issues. In December 2012, Pine Rest implemented its Mother and Baby Program designed to provide short-term, intensive treatment to women who are pregnant or up to one year postpartum and struggling with perinatal mood disorders. In 2013, the Van Andel-Cook Center for Dementia and Geriatric Behavioral Health opened as part of a 3-phase expansion project on the Pine Rest main campus in Cutlerville. 349 donors contributed more than $3.2 million toward the total cost of the project. Services include an older adult inpatient unit, outpatient services such as neuropsychological evaluation, memory disorder assessment and treatment recommendations, and diagnosis and treatment for senior cognitive and behavioral health issues. The center was named for its lead donors, the Foundation of Jay and Betty Van Andel and the Peter C. and Emajean Cook Foundation. In February 2014, a 22-bed inpatient hospital unit opened as part of a 3-phase facilities investment construction project. Services at the Redwood Unit are dedicated to the treatment and care of patients with co- occurring disorders (mental health diagnosis and substance abuse diagnosis). The 20,417 sq ft wing includes four single barrier-free rooms, six single rooms and six semi-private rooms. In March 2014, the Pine Rest Professional Practice Group (PPG) opened up a new outpatient clinic in Portage, MI. The building consists of five offices, has nine therapists, and provides therapy services for those with mental health disorders and/or substance use disorders. In July 2014, the first class of residents started work in Pine Rest's four-year Psychiatric Residency Program led by Director Dr. William Sanders. In the fall of 2016 plans for the Flex unit were put into play. The flex unit will consist of a young adult and older adolescents, as well as adults. It is in its name that the unit will flex, or have flexibility to meet population needs. In the spring of 2019 Pine Rest opened a regional first Psychiatric Urgent Care Center on their Cutlerville Campus. The center is meant to provide same-day assessment and treatment for people experiencing acute psychiatric symptoms who can‚Äôt wait for routine outpatient services, a common problem for patients seeking mental health treatment. The goal is to reduce the number of hospitalizations due to mental health. \\"This is a national issue and we‚Äôre going to take sort of a national level thinking and bring it here to West Michigan, to serve the community better,‚Äù said Pine Rest President and CEO Mark Eastburg. Grand Rapids area hospitals had 14,623 behavioral health visits to emergency rooms in 2016, according to Pine Rest. The Psychiatric Urgent Care Center is expected to reduce wait times for psychiatric assessments and will provide clinical services in a calm environment for those experiencing psychiatric symptoms such as: depression, anxiety, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, disturbing thoughts, acute grief reactions, trouble managing daily activities and substance abuse disorders.https://www.woodtv.com/news/grand-rapids/pine-rest-opens- psychiatric-urgent-care-center-in-gr/ Lectures, classes and events Pine Rest sponsors a variety of workshops, classes and special events throughout the year both for professionals and also for the public.

The legislation was championed by the Reagan administration to address concerns about the surface transportation infrastructure (highways and bridges). The Act contained Title V, known as the Highway Revenue Act of 1982, which added five cents to the per gallon gas tax (the first such increase since 1961), of which four cents was dedicated to restore interstate highways and bridges, and one cent for public transit. The Act also set a goal of 10 percent for participation of disadvantaged business enterprises in federal-aid projects.  Section 165: \\"Buy America\\" Act  Section 165 (), called the \\"Buy America\\" provision or Buy America Act--not to be confused with the 1933-enacted Buy American Act--applies to mass-transit-related procurements. It established requirements intended to give preference to the use of domestically produced materials on any procurements funded at least in part by federal funds. Implementation of the requirements is regulated by the Federal Transit Administration.  Section 405  Effective in 1983, Section 405 () was enacted to encourage employee reporting of noncompliance with safety regulations governing commercial motor vehicles. Congress recognized that employees in the transportation industry are often best able to detect safety violations and yet, because they may be threatened with discharge for cooperating with enforcement agencies, they need express protection against retaliation for reporting these violations. See, e. g., 128 Cong. Rec. 32698 (1982) (remarks of Sen. Percy); id., at 32509‚Äì32510 (remarks of Sen. Danforth). Section 405 protects employee \\"whistle-blowers\\" by forbidding discharge, discipline, or other forms of discrimination by the employer in response to an employee's complaining about or refusing to operate motor vehicles that do not meet the applicable safety standards. Congress also recognized that the employee's protection against having to choose between operating an unsafe vehicle and losing his job would lack practical effectiveness if the [481 U.S. 252, 259] employee could not be reinstated pending complete review. The longer a discharged employee remains unemployed, the more devastating are the consequences to his personal financial condition and prospects for reemployment. Ensuring the eventual recovery of backpay may not alone provide sufficient protection to encourage reports of safety violations. Accordingly, 405 incorporates additional protections, authorizing temporary reinstatement based on a preliminary finding of reasonable cause to believe that the employee has suffered a retaliatory discharge. The statute reflects a careful balancing of the relative interests of the Government, employee, and employer. It evidences a legislative determination that the preliminary investigation and finding of reasonable cause by the Secretary, if followed \\"expeditiously\\" by a hearing on the record at the employer's request, provide effective protection to the employee and ensure fair consideration of the employer's interest in making unimpaired hiring decisions. Truck drivers who believe they have suffered retaliation for reporting violations, refusing to commit violations, or participating in proceedings, can seek relief from the U.S. Department of Labor. Under STAA, truck drivers who believe they have suffered an adverse employment action (such as discharge, demotion, discipline, or denial of advancement), have 180 days to file a simple written complaint with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The complaint can be postmarked or faxed to meet the deadline. If OSHA determines that a violation did occur, it can issue a preliminary order requiring reinstatement during further proceedings. Both sides will have an opportunity to present their evidence in a recorded hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ's decision is reviewed by the Administrative Review Board, and parties can appeal to federal courts of appeals. In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc., 481 U.S. 252, that due process requires that employers receive prereinstatement notice of the employee's allegations, notice of the substance of the relevant supporting evidence, an opportunity to submit a written response, and an opportunity to meet with the investigator and present statements from rebuttal witnesses. These procedures provide a reliable initial check against mistaken decisions  Sections 411‚Äì412: National Truck Network  Sections 411 and 412 () first authorized the establishment of a national network of highways designated for use by large trucks. On these highways, federal width and length limits apply. The National Network includes almost all of the Interstate Highway System and other, specified non-Interstate highways. Section 412 also specifically prohibits any state from denying reasonable access to the National Network. Provisions in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 further defined the National Network.

Along with long-time tag team partner Chigusa Nagayo she formed The Crush Gals, known for their mainstream popularity in the 1980s, and for being one of the most successful women's tag teams of all time. Career Born on July 28, 1963, Asuka joined All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) in 1980, and had her professional debut on May 10 of that year. She was an immediate success, winning her first title, the AJW Junior Championship, the following year, and the AJW Singles Championship in 1982. In 1983 she formed a tag team, called the Crush Gals, with Chigusa Nagayo. The Crush Gals were huge stars for the (AJW), in the mid-1980s. They feuded with Dump Matsumoto and the Jumping Bomb Angels. Thanks to their fame, AJW's weekly television broadcast consistently brought in ratings over 12.0.Molinaro, John F.: Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time, page 167, Winding Stair Press: 2002 Their fame also carried over into other media, including recording top ten singles. In the late 1980s, the Crush Gals broke up, and Asuka began a lengthy feud with Nagayo, which culminated in her achievement of the WWWA World Single Championship in 1989. She retired later that year, but came out of retirement in 1994 and formed the Rideen Array, a faction consisting of fellow freelance wrestlers Jaguar Yokota and Bison Kimura. She subsequently wrestled for many of the new women's promotions that arose at that time, such as Jd' and Arsion. In 1998, she made a significant move when she joined GAEA Japan, the promotion run by her former partner, Nagayo. Asuka began her GAEA career as a top heel, feuding with Nagayo, and, in one storyline, winning control of the organization from her and eventually creating the Super Star Unit (SSU), a faction composed of veteran stars such as Akira Hokuto, Aja Kong, and Las Cachorras Orientales, among others. However, near the end of 1999, Nagayo and Asuka united against a common rival, the Mayumi Ozaki-led faction Team Nostradamus, and, the next spring, reformed the Crush Gals. The storyline was huge news in Japan, and GAEA's show of May 14, 2000, featuring the debut of the reunited team, now called CRUSH 2000, was the biggest in the promotion's history. Due to a neck injury, Asuka announced her retirement on November 3, 2004. Her retirement was made official on April 3, 2005 where she and Chigusa Nagayo teamed up for the last time to defeat Chikayo Nagashima and Sugar Sato at GAEA's tenth anniversary show.

From its origins Australians have had many links to Doctor Who: two Australian writers played key roles in the series' gestation ‚Äì C.E. \\"Bunny\\" Webber and Anthony Coburn, Coburn having worked on the pre-production and first story; the iconic Doctor Who theme music was written by Australian musician Ron Grainer; one-time Australian ballet composer Dudley Simpson wrote incidental music for many stories during the 1960s and 1970s; and the actress Janet Fielding played popular companion Tegan in the 1980s. Additionally, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) was one of the first and longest term purchasers of the series from the BBC, initially planning its Australian debut for May 1964, only six months after the UK premiere. In 1979 the ABC organised a nationwide promotional tour by then-current Doctor Tom Baker and, in 1983, it co-funded the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors. Australia was also a key market for the many products licensed by BBC Enterprises and the success of the series in Australia was an important factor in its worldwide penetration; English- speaking countries in the Asia-Pacific region generally bought whatever episodes the ABC had cleared for its own use, and BBC Enterprises' office for the entire region was in Sydney and dealt with the censors and marketing. Broadcast history Doctor Who was first purchased from the BBC by the then Australian Broadcasting Commission ‚Äì now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) ‚Äì in March 1964 and initially planned for premiere in May. However the Australian Film Censorship Board (AFCB) classified the series' first thirteen episodes 'A', meaning they were only suitable for a young adult audience, thus preventing the ABC from showing the series in the 6:30pm Sunday timeslot they had intended to use. As a result, the show's Australian debut was held over until January 1965 and, thereafter, it became an important part of the ABC's schedule. This included both prime time first-run episodes, as well as repeats of some or all of the most recent serials during both prime time and school holidays, meaning Australian viewers had more opportunities to see the series than viewers in Britain, where repeats were extremely uncommon at the time. =The 1960s= Doctor Who was first broadcast in Australia by the ABC's Perth station, ABW-2, on Tuesday 12 January 1965.Martin Dunne 'A Separate Adventure' in Chameleon Factor # 78, (SFSA/SADWFC, 2003) Individual episodes were sent to Australia by the BBC in the form of one 16mm black and white film print. If simultaneous broadcast was required (i.e. the same episode scheduled in two different cities on the same date) the ABC had to make copies and send them to the relevant stations for local transmission (until the late 1960s the national broadcaster wasn't networked and regional variations ‚Äì both between metropolitan areas as well as between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas ‚Äì remained commonplace until as late as the mid-1980s.Based on seeing the actual film reels; annual booklets about broadcasting in Australia; and unpublished research done in ABC TV Archives by Antony Howe. However, for much of Doctor Who's first decade on Australian television, each episode's film or video print was physically transported from city to city, for broadcast in each on a different date and generally according to an entirely different schedule. For example, after being screened in Perth on Tuesday 12 January 1965, the first episode An Unearthly Child was screened by ABN-2 Sydney on Friday 15 January, then by ABQ-2 Brisbane on Friday 22 January, by ABV-2 Melbourne on Saturday 20 February and by ABS-2 Adelaide on Monday 15 March. As a result, different broadcast regions saw different episodes on different days, sometimes weeks or even months after the same episode had been screened elsewhere in the country. Later improvements in the capacity of cable or microwave and other links enabled the ABC to broadcast on an increasingly national basis, although even into the 1970s the debut screenings of some episodes were still weeks apart from one city to the next. Episodes continued to be broadcast weekly until mid-1966, generally in the same timeslot for each city that the programme had debuted in the previous year. By the time the last weekly episode was broadcast in June 1966 ‚Äì episode 4 of The Crusade ‚Äì first-run ABC episodes were still only around twelve months behind their original BBC transmission dates. In October 1966 the first episode of The Space Museum marked the first time the ABC stripped Doctor Who in the 6:30 Monday‚ÄìThursday timeslot. With only occasional changes or minor variations to days and times, the ABC continued to strip Doctor Who in a weekday early-evening timeslot for much of the next twenty-six years. Later in 1966 the ABC also started showing repeats of chunks of the most recent first- run stories in the same stripped prime-time slot. (Repeats not only remained commonplace, but their regularity also went on to generate fan dissatisfaction by the early 1980s). Doctor Who's first regeneration, from William Hartnell's First Doctor to Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor, was first screened in Australian by ABS-2 Adelaide on Friday 7 July 1967, then elsewhere during July and September.unpublished personal contemporary records, research of contemporary TV listings. From mid-1969 into the 1970s the ABC returned Doctor Who to a mostly weekly schedule, typically in an early-evening Friday timeslot or late-afternoon on Sundays. Between series of Doctor Who shows from similar genre were typically shown, including Timeslip, Phoenix Five and Frank and Francesca. In May 1969 the first of what would become regularly scheduled school holiday repeats commenced. The ABC had only scheduled repeats during a school holiday period once before, in 1965, but the practice became commonplace and was repeated throughout most school holiday periods (though with differing schedules between cities) until May 1974, after which no further school holiday repeats were scheduled. =The 1970s= With repeats regularly scheduled during school holidays until May 1974, as well as first- run episodes being screened at the same time, there was sometimes as many as eleven episodes of Doctor Who screened in any given week. But within only a few years, the number of episodes being lavished on fans decreased dramatically. By the beginning of the 1970s, the gap between UK and Australian premieres of Doctor Who had extended to twenty-one months. Individual episodes were still being shipped from one city to another for local transmission and ABC schedules were also still decided, at least to a limited extent, at a local level. Throughout April and May 1970 the ABC's first Doctor Who debut of the decade was The Dominators, first shown on BBC1 in August 1968. By the time the first episode to feature Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor premiered around the country during July and August 1971, the UK/Australia gap had been marginally reduced to eighteen months.\\"Australasian Doctor Who Fanclub Calendar [for] 1984 (publ. by Antony Howe in late 1983), dates on each month's page; unpublished personal contemporary records. The BBC's switch to colour for Pertwee's first season in 1970 couldn't be reflected in Australia, where colour broadcasting was experimenting in 1972‚Äì1974 but didn't commence final transmission until March 1975. Nearly all of the Pertwee era was first screened in Australia in black and white, with his final season the first to premiere in colour around the country at various times between 1975 and 1977. (Stories from Pertwee's first four seasons weren't broadcast in colour for the first time until the ABC purchased additional repeat rights to numerous blocks of those serials between 1978 and 1986). After having aired more-or-less continuously for nine years, 1974 saw a dramatic ongoing change in the ABC's scheduling of Doctor Who. The last twelve first-run episodes of Season 9 were broadcast weekly between January and March, followed by Monday‚ÄìFriday repeats of the same season from September/October until December/January. For several years in the mid-1970s there followed a haphazard scheduling of Doctor Who, with seasons either broken up or only partially screened due to serials being omitted, as well as last-minute or unannounced cancellations of scheduled broadcasts that were occasionally countered by equally abrupt and unannounced 'surprise' broadcasts if, for example, a sporting event was cancelled due to bad weather. One of the results of this combination of factors was that the Australian premiere of first-run episodes ‚Äì which, by 1975, was still a year behind BBC1 ‚Äì began to again drift further and further behind the UK. In Sydney in 1975, the ABC screened just fourteen weekly installments of Doctor Who ‚Äì The Time Warrior, Death to the Daleks and The Monster of Peladon ‚Äì between March and June. These were the first episodes to be broadcast by the ABC in colour. (Due to the BBC's accidental wiping of the master tape of Invasion of the Dinosaurs' first episode, that story wasn't screened at all by the ABC until November 1984, when they simply broadcast it ‚Äì without any preceding explanation ‚Äì as a five-part story, starting from episode 2. They never actually broadcast the full six episode story until 2004).Molesworth, Richard (2010); Wiped!: Doctor Who's Missing Episodes; Telos Publishing, p. 61.; unpublished personal contemporary records; unpublished personal contemporary records. In 1976 Doctor Who fans in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane fared only marginally better than they had in 1975, with sixteen weekly installments broadcast, starting with Planet of the Spiders at various times between March and May, followed by Tom Baker's debut in Robot, then The Sontaran Experiment and The Ark In Space (in that incorrect order). At about the same time the ABC announced its decision not to buy any further new episodes of Doctor Who. The announcement generated uproar among fans, who went on to stage an ongoing series of protests in an attempt to save the show (see below); in doing so, the first seeds of Australian Doctor Who fandom were effectively sown. Despite the earlier announcement, 1977 was again a marginally better year than the one before. There were nineteen weekly episodes broadcast, commencing in May with the significantly delayed first runs of Season 12's Genesis of the Daleks and Revenge Of The Cybermen (more than two years after their first UK broadcast), before repeating The Time Warrior and Death to the Daleks from the previous season. With a new Controller of Television, James Fitzmaurice, the ABC reversed its decision on Doctor Who towards the end of 1977 and from early 1978 the show was again a regular fixture within the ABC's early-evening weeknight schedules. Typically it was stripped Monday-Thursday at 6:30pm, though there were some variations to this as well as some exceptions to what was actually screened (e.g. The Brain of Morbius ‚Äì see below). Tom Baker's second and third seasons marked a major up-turn in the show's popularity around the world and the ABC renewed repeat rights to many colour episodes from the Jon Pertwee era, including ones that had previously been blocked from early-evening broadcast due to originally having been classified 'A' by the Australian Film Censorship Board (AFCB). (These episodes were reviewed again by the Board which, by this time, felt that they were suitable for general broadcast). In a sequence that the ABC would repeat several times over the following four years, new Tom Baker episodes would be shown, followed by a rerun of selected colour episodes from Jon Pertwee's Spearhead from Space onwards. In 1979 the ABC brought Tom Baker to Australia for a nationwide promotional campaign and media blitz. He later made a second visit (this time only to Sydney) to popularise the new line of merchandise centred on his characterisation of the Doctor (posters, buttons, etc.). =The 1980s= The period from 1978 through to the mid-1980s saw the ABC continue to strip Doctor Who in an early-evening weekday timeslot; typically it was Monday-Thursday or Monday‚ÄìFriday, at either 6:00 or 6:30 pm. It would almost always screen throughout the year and, more often than not, it was paired with another program at 6:00: most notably The Goodies;After a 30-year wait, the Goodies can finally reveal all, Sydney Morning Herald, 19 August 2012\\"(Peter Russell-Clarke's) ABC show that ran between The Goodies and Doctor Who throughout the 1980s\\" ‚Äì That was then, this is now, Sydney Morning Herald, 28 February 2010 but also others such as The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, Spike Milligan's Q or ABC productions such as Home or Sweet & Sour. Doctor Who would usually be followed by a single music video clip or some other suitably short program to fill the remaining five minutes before the 7pm news (Doctor Who episodes were generally 25 minutes long at the time). However, in early 1981 those who were eagerly awaiting the return of Doctor Who after the summer non- ratings period were dismayed to find an unknown Japanese fantasy series called Monkey screening in what had become the traditional timeslot for The Goodies & Doctor Who. Following increasing complaints about the volume of Doctor Who repeats, the ABC took the decision not to screen the show at all during 1981. Early 1981 also saw the departure of the longest running Doctor, Tom Baker. Having caught up from the 1981 hiatus by screening all of Baker's final season four nights a week during March and April 1982, the ABC continued screening the series almost as soon as it had been shown by the BBC. The ABC screened Peter Davison's debut in Castrovalva at the end of April, just three months after its UK debut. For Doctor Whos 20th anniversary in 1983 the ABC provided some production funding for the special 90-minute anniversary story, The Five Doctors, and made a greater-than-usual promotional effort, screening it just 18 days after its UK broadcast. (The nationwide visit by Peter Davison earlier in 1983 had been organised by a department store chain!). The launch of satellite technology in the mid-1980s enabled the ABC to begin broadcasting on a truly national scale and from around 1986 there were rarely differences in capital city schedules, though regional variations remained as the ABC's charter as a public broadcaster meant that it had to fulfill that function more often in regional areas with only one other television station (as was the case with all of regional Australia until around 1989). As such, where precedence was occasionally given to local events (sport, elections, etc.), programs like Doctor Who would sometimes find themselves moved to a different timeslot, if not bumped from the schedule altogether. The pattern of new episodes and repeats continued, with more-or-less uninterrupted broadcast of Doctor Who throughout the ratings periods of 1982, 1983 and 1984, including numerous black and white Pertwee serials unscreened for ten years. In 1985 Doctor Who didn't return to the ABC until the premiere of Colin Baker's first full season in early December. On its original UK broadcast, Season 22 featured a change in format to 45-minute episodes. However, to fit with established scheduling here in Australia, the ABC cut each 45-minute episode in half, resulting in two roughly 23¬Ω minute episodes and meaning a particularly poor 'non-cliffhanger' was created at around the halfway mark of each of the original episodes. After part four of Revelation of the Daleks in late January 1986, fans were surprised by the broadcast of two black and white Troughton serials (The Mind Robber and The Krotons), screened by the ABC for the first time since 1971. Nearly all Pertwee episodes that only existed in black and white were also screened along with the rest of the Pertwee era in 1986, though again with the exception of part one of Invasion of the Dinosaurs. (A full run of all available black and white serials didn't happen until the ABC celebrated the show's 40th anniversary in 2003, though at that time some Dalek stories were omitted due to an ongoing dispute between the BBC and Terry Nation's estate). The fourteen episode season-long epic that would become Colin Baker's swansong, The Trial of a Time Lord, finally debuted on the ABC in February 1987, five months after its UK debut and just over two months since news of Baker's dismissal from the role was made public. Where the ABC had played around with the previous season's 45-minute format by splitting the episodes in half, with Season 23 they moved the show to an early Saturday evening slot and edited two 25-minute episodes together. So the fourteen episodes took only seven weeks to get through and once the marathon tale was finished the ABC retained the timeslot to continue, in the same two edited episode format, from where they'd left off at the end of 1986 with Tom Baker repeats. In September 1987 the program was moved to 1pm Saturdays, sticking with the two episode format for another six weeks. Starting from Image of the Fendahl (metro) / The Invisible Enemy (regional), whole story omnibus editions were broadcast, with all their episodes edited together to form one long feature-length presentation. This format was retained, with only minor variations to the timeslot, until The Caves of Androzani on Saturday 2 July 1988. On 31 October 1988, stripped weekday transmissions of new episodes of Doctor Who recommenced, with the show now in the 5:30pm timeslot and broadcast under the umbrella of the children's magazine-style program The Afternoon Show, starting with Sylvester McCoy's debut in Time and the Rani almost fourteen months after it first screened on BBC1. (This extended delay in broadcasting was repeated for Doctor Who's final two seasons as well). After Season 24 finished, as a gesture to fans in recognition of Doctor Who's 25th anniversary, the ABC also screened the first story of Season 25, Remembrance of the Daleks, only a little more a month since its UK debut. Throughout 1989 Doctor Who continued as part of The Afternoon Show, first with a series of Tom Baker repeats from Robot to The Brain of Morbius during February and March, then The Seeds of Doom through to The Invisible Enemy during June, July and August. A repeat of Season 24 and Remembrance of the Daleks commenced in late-October, with the first-run The Greatest Show in the Galaxy debuting on 17 November, eleven months after the UK. Broadcast completely out of UK transmission order, the season ended with part three of The Happiness Patrol in early December. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, numerous stories either weren't broadcast alongside the other serials from their respective seasons, or hadn't been purchased at all. Aside from Invasion of the Dinosaurs (see earlier reference), almost all of these serials were omitted because they'd been reviewed by the Australian Film Censorship Board (AFCB) and classified as not suitable for general viewing, which meant they couldn't be screened before 8:30 pm without having scenes of violence or horror edited down or removed entirely; even after being edited, many still couldn't be shown any earlier than 7:30 pm. Due to the BBC's junking policy during the 1970s, which saw the master copies of hundreds of early Doctor Who episodes destroyed, the majority of unscreened 1960s serials were never broadcast in Australia. Almost all of the 1970s serials were subsequently reviewed again by the Board and re-classified as being suitable for a general audience, but by 1980 one of them ‚Äì The Brain of Morbius ‚Äì was still classified as suitable only for adults; even after it was reviewed a second time by the AFCB for in 1978, it was still deemed to be too dark and violent for children. Eventually a heavily censored 60-minute omnibus edition of the story debuted on ABS-2 Adelaide at 8:30 pm in October 1978. It was later broadcast in all other capital cities in the same timeslot in January 1980. By 1986 it had been reconstructed as a four-part story, but the previous censor cuts remained. The ABC didn't play an uncensored version of Morbius until the show was being broadcast at 4:30 am weekdays during 1993. =The 1990s: 1990‚Äì94= Doctor Who returned to the ABC in April 1990 with another six weeks of Tom Baker repeats, picking up from where they'd left off in 1989 with The Invisible Enemy. The show was again stripped Monday-Friday at 5:30pm as part of The Afternoon Show. Another six-week block of Baker repeats commenced in early-July, followed by a return to Sylvester McCoy serials for four weeks from mid-October; this block commenced with a repeat of the last three stories of Season 25, followed by the first-run of all four Season 26 serials, finishing with Part Three of Survival on 16 November 1990. This was the last 'classic' series episode to debut on the ABC (aside from the first episode of Invasion of the Dinosaurs ‚Äì see below). Nearly a year later, Tom Baker repeats recommenced. The nine-week block ended with the final episode of Logopolis on 3 January 1992. It was the last time that Doctor Who was screened as part of The Afternoon Show. On 8 March 1993 Doctor Who returned to the ABC schedule, this time at 4:30am Monday-Friday. Again picking up from where the last block had left off, this run commenced with Castrovalva and continued virtually uninterrupted until almost exactly one year later. Over the course of that year, all Fifth Doctor serials except The Five Doctors were screened, followed by the first seven Sixth Doctor serials up to Revelation of the Daleks. Another run of Tom Baker episodes started in July, from The Ark in Space and cycling through twenty serials ‚Äì mostly in original UK transmission order ‚Äì before reverting to Revenge of the Cybermen in November (it hadn't been screened in July). To commemorate Doctor Who's 30th anniversary, the ABC showed all four episodes of An Unearthly Child at 6:00 pm from Monday 22 ‚Äì Thursday 25 November 1993. Its final episode, The Firemaker, marked the last time the ABC screened Doctor Who in an early-evening weekday slot until commemorating its 40th anniversary ten years later. Meanwhile, in the first week of December 1993 the early-morning schedule reverted to another run of Davison serials from Black Orchid through to The Caves of Androzani, again followed by the first seven Colin Baker serials. Between 1 February and 1 March 1994 the schedule changed to two back-to-back episodes per day, at 4:10 am and 4:35 am. The four-part episodic version of The Five Doctors wasn't shown, but the four episode edit of Resurrection of the Daleks was, as were the Australian 23¬Ω minute episodes of Colin Baker's Season 22 stories. On 4 March 1994, Part Four of Revelation of the Daleks became the last episode from the 'classic' series of Doctor Who to be screened by the ABC until their 40th anniversary commemoration in September 2003. =1996: The Telemovie= The first attempt to revive Doctor Who was with a made-for-TV movie, filmed in Canada and financed and produced in the US for the FOX network, in 1996. It featured Sylvester McCoy in his final portrayal of the Seventh Doctor and introduced Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor. The ABC premiere of the movie was on Sunday 7 July at 8.30pm, nearly two months after its Canadian and US debut and almost six weeks after its first airing in the UK. The ABC had originally planned a 3 July airdate, but didn't want to clash with The X-Files, which was already established in the 8:30pm Wednesday timeslot and was achieving its peak success in Australia at the time. Material in the movie was cut in the US to allow for extra advertising time, but these cuts were largely restored for the ABC's Australian broadcast. A publicity screening of the cut version had been held on 5 June at Planet Hollywood in Sydney, with several fan-built Daleks operated by fan club members acting as ushers.\\"Data Extract\\" 121, July/August 1996, pp. 1, 4, 6‚Äì9, and other parts of the (unpaginated) issue contains news and reviews of this \\"film\\" from Australians and from around the world. During the summer non-ratings period of 1996‚Äì97, the ABC repeated the movie at 8:30pm on Wednesday 15 January. In recognition of Doctor Who's 35th anniversary they also replayed it a second time, at 11pm on Wednesday 25 November 1998. =The 1990s: 1996‚Äì99= Less than a month after the ABC premiere of the Doctor Who telemovie, the coming of subscription television to Australia saw the commencement of one of Doctor Who's longest uninterrupted runs. Foxtel's UKTV channel started screening the show from 1 August 1996; beginning with An Unearthly Child and airing weeknights at 11:30pm (plus weekend omnibus encores on Saturdays and Sundays), every available episode of the series was shown. The run ended more than two years later with the then most recent production, Doctor Who, on 16 August 1998. After a break of only six weeks, another long run commenced in early-October 1998, starting from The Edge of Destruction and continuing through a selection of stories screened in a largely random order, although some were loosely grouped together on the basis of villains, locations or other themes. This run also included the results of UKTV's first viewer survey, with the ten stories voted most popular filling the last two months of the schedule, ending with The Five Doctors in November 1999. As well, this run featured the first Australian broadcast of the 1992 documentary Resistance is Useless, as well as More Than... Thirty Years in the TARDIS, the 1994 expanded version of the BBC's 30th anniversary documentary Doctor Who: Thirty Years in the TARDIS. Neither Resistance Is Useless nor either of the Thirty Years... productions had ever previously been shown on Australian television. =The 2000s= From 13 January 2000 the scheduling of Doctor Who on Foxtel's UKTV continued unabated. Returning to 11:30pm MondayFriday and again starting from the beginning, with very few exceptions virtually every episode screened in the previous run were shown again. On 17 June 2002, as with the 19961998 run of episodes this one also ended with the 1996 Doctor Who telemovie. In October 2003 UKTV recommenced screening Doctor Who with its 40th Anniversary \\"Best Of\\" Selection. The selection included twelve stories: An Unearthly Child, The War Games, The Three Doctors, The Green Death, The Deadly Assassin, Logopolis, The Five Doctors, The Caves of Androzani, The Two Doctors, The Ultimate Foe, Survival and the 1996 telemovie. Omnibus editions of each were shown, with two stories screened from 8am until midday each Saturday between 11 October and 22 November. UKTV also presented a 40th Anniversary \\"Special Surprise\\" at 8:30pm on Sunday 23 November 2003. This was the last time that UKTV screened an episode of the 'classic' series. =2003‚Äì2006= In commemoration of Doctor Who's 40th anniversary, between September 2003 and February 2006 the ABC repeated the majority of the 'classic' series. The majority of available complete stories were screened true to their original UK transmission order at 6:05 pm Monday-Thursday. From November 2005 two episodes per night were screened, at 6:05pm and 6:30pm. Throughout the entire run, each episode was preceded by a 10-second animated title card featuring retro music, 60s-style shapes and colours and the words Back to the Future. Part One of Invasion of the Dinosaurs finally had its ABC premiere in September 2004; it was the first time the ABC had ever shown all six episodes of the story together, more than thirty years after it was made and nearly twenty years after the ABC first screened it as a five-part serial. Numerous surviving serials were omitted due to a dispute between the BBC and the Estate of the late Terry Nation over the rights to the Daleks. Serials omitted due to this dispute were the Dalek stories Day..., Planet..., Destiny..., Resurrection..., Revelation... and Remembrance of the Daleks and Frontier in Space. The War Games, Patrick Troughton's ten episode finale which features a Dalek for only a few seconds, was also skipped, while The Five Doctors ‚Äì shown by the ABC in four-part episodic format for the first time ‚Äì had its Dalek scenes edited out. Some episodes of Inferno, Carnival of Monsters, Invasion of the Dinosaurs and The Trial of a Time Lord were shown as early edits which differed from the BBC's final broadcast versions, while some of the 1960s episodes, The Dominators etc., were cut to reduce violence (Presumably due to them being the same edited prints by the ABC from the 1960s. The run ended with Part Three of Survival on 3 February 2006. As at July 2014, this remains the last time an episode of 'classic' Doctor Who was screened on the ABC. = 2005: The revival of Doctor Who = When the BBC revived Doctor Who in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and with Russell T. Davies as producer, the ABC responded by scheduling the series in the prime-time 7:30pm Saturday slot. Following the UK broadcast by less than two months, Series 1 of the new Doctor Who premiered in Australia with the first episode, Rose, on 21 May 2005,New Doctor Who ABC Tasmania story dated 30 September 2003 going on to win its timeslot in four out of five capital cities. Series 1 of Doctor Who also saw the inception of the Doctor Who Christmas Special. The concept of a Christmas Special episode derived of an otherwise ongoing series has been commonplace in UK television for decades. However, the classic series of Doctor Who only ever featured one episode with any purposeful Christmas-related content: episode 7 of The Daleks' Masterplan was broadcast by the BBC on Christmas Day 1965 and featured The First Doctor William Hartnell offering viewers seasons' greetings direct-to-camera. For the first three series of the revived Doctor Who, the Christmas Special was held over by the ABC to be broadcast a week ahead of the next series, commencing with The Christmas Invasion which the ABC used to kick off Series 2 in Australia on Saturday 8 July 2006 ‚Äì about ten hours before Series 2 finished in the UK. Following the ABC's premiere of The Runaway Bride at 8:35pm on Thursday 28 June 2007, Series 3 was again broadcast in the 7:30pm Saturday slot from 30 June.ABC Schedules Who for 2007 Information released on SFSA web site; story dated 8 May 2007 This was the last first-run broadcast of Doctor Who on the ABC before the network was re-branded, in February 2008, as a multi-channel free-to-air and digital concern. Within weeks of the re- branding, a repeat of Series 1 commenced at 8:30pm Fridays on ABC2. Series 4 saw the series moved to 7:30pm Sundays on ABC1, commencing on Sunday 29 June 2008 with Voyage of the Damned, followed by the rest of Series 4 on subsequent Sunday nights. For the first ‚Äì and, subsequently, the only ‚Äì time, the ABC achieved audiences in excess of 1 million viewers for every episode of the series. ABC1 also began screening Doctor Who Confidential (in cut-down form) in 2008, immediately following each week's episode. On Sunday 25 January 2009 The Next Doctor had its Australian debut, only a month after its UK Christmas Day broadcast. Two days later, a repeat run of Series 2 and Series 3 (including Confidential Cutdown) commenced on ABC1 in the 8:30pm Tuesday slot. Following The Idiot's Lantern on 17 March, the run was interrupted for nearly sixteen weeks, before recommencing on ABC2 on Mondays at 9:30pm from 6 July. The run continued weekly, without further interruption or scheduling changes, until Journey's End on 22 February 2010. Seven weeks after its UK Easter broadcast, Planet of the Dead premiered on ABC1 on Sunday 31 May while The Waters of Mars, the third of four specials that made up David Tennant's final series as The Doctor, debuted on ABC1 on Sunday 6 December, just three weeks after UK broadcast. The final two episodes of the Tennant era, \\"The End of Time\\" (broadcast on Christmas Day and New Year's Day in the UK) aired on ABC1 at 7:30pm Sundays on 14 and 21 February. In 2010 the gap between UK and Australian broadcasts was reduced to just two weeks. ABC1 aired the first episode of Series 5, The Eleventh Hour starring Matt Smith in his first full story as The Eleventh Doctor, at 7:30pm on Sunday 18 April. Each episode of the series could also be viewed on the ABC's iView website two days prior to the television airdate. In an unprecedented move, the 2010 Christmas Special A Christmas Carol aired on ABC1 at 7:30pm Boxing Day, only around 12 hours after it had finished in the UK. In 45 years of broadcasting Doctor Who this was the shortest delay between UK and Australian transmission. Earlier that day ABC1 had also screened Doctor Who at the Proms. From the following week, commencing with \\"The End of Time\\" Part 1, they repeated David Tennant's finale followed by Series 5 in various timeslots close to 5:30pm, ending with The Big Bang on 24 April. By 2011 the UK/Australia gap was down to just one week, with the first half of Series 6 going out on ABC1 at 7:30pm from Saturday 30 April, just one week after its BBC One debut. The pattern continued with the second half of the series, airing just a week after the UK from Saturday 3 September from Let's Kill Hitler. Between June and September ABC1 also scheduled a repeat of Series 4 in numerous late-night Saturday slots varying between 10:15pm and 12:55am. On Boxing Day, ABC1 again broadcast the Doctor Who Christmas special within about twelve hours of its UK broadcast, giving The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe its Australian debut at 7:30pm. In late- night slots across the Christmas weekend ABC1 had repeated The Next Doctor on 24 December, A Christmas Carol on Christmas night) and then The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe at 11:55pm on Boxing Day, only a little over three hours since it had first aired. This became the shortest gap between an episode's debut outing and its first repeat by the network. From January 2012 ABC2 commenced a full repeat run of the entire revived series of Doctor Who, stripped Monday-Friday at 7:30pm, from Rose on 2 January all the way through to The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe on 12 September. The run was interrupted for seven days between 30 August and 7 September for ABC2's broadcast of the 2012 London Paralympics. Later in 2012 the gap between UK and Australian broadcasts was reduced to the shortest it had ever been. From Sunday 2 September 2012 first run episodes from the first part of Series 7 were made available via the ABC's iView platform from 5:10am AEST ‚Äì literally within minutes of them having finished in the UK. Starting with The Beast Below, the same episodes were broadcast at 7:30pm the following Saturday, followed by an ABC2 encore at 9:30pm the following Tuesday. Over the 201213 summer non-ratings period, ABC1 added a handful of Doctor Who episodes to its 6pm Friday slot for repeating ‚Äì The Waters of Mars, one Doctor Who's Greatest Moments special and the first three episodes of Series 7b. At Christmas 2012, The Snowmen was available on ABC iView by 5:30am on Boxing Day, before being broadcast at 7:30pm Boxing Day on ABC1, followed by an ABC2 encore at 9:30pm on New Year's night. On 31 March 2013 the second part of Series 7 returned to 7:30pm Sundays on ABC1, again only about half a day after each episode ended on BBC One. Immediately afterwards, each episode became available on iView for one week, with an ABC2 encore broadcast at 8:30 the following (Monday) night. Later in the year, ABC1 took a live simulcast from the BBC to screen Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor, the half-hour special in which the actor chosen to play the Twelfth Doctor was revealed before a live studio audience, on Monday 5 August at 4am. The special was replayed on ABC2 at 8:30pm on that same day. Purposefully timed as part of the ABC's recognition of Doctor Who's 50th Anniversary celebrations, from 1 July ABC2 again repeated the revived series Monday-Friday at ~7:35pm. Starting with the three 2009 Doctor Who's Greatest Moments specials made by the Doctor Who Confidential team, they then went back to Series 1 and Rose and continued all the way through to The Name of the Doctor on Friday 22 November. On the morning of Sunday 24 November ABC1 was one of multiple broadcasters in 94 countries to take a live simulcast of the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special The Day of the Doctor from the BBC. The live simulcast went out across Australia at local times ranging from 3:50am to 6:50am. From 8:30am the episode was available via iView and was subsequently broadcast in prime-time at 7:30pm that night, then replayed on ABC2 at 7:30 the following night. There was also a limited run of 3D cinema screenings of The Day of the Doctor around the country. ABC1 paired The Day of the Doctor with An Adventure in Space and Time, the feature-length drama that recreated Doctor Who's formative years. It had its ABC1 premiere at 8:50pm, immediately following The Name of The Doctor, as well as an encore screening at 1pm the following day. At Christmas, the Doctor Who Christmas Special was again scheduled into ABC1's 7:30pm Boxing Day timeslot, with The Time of the Doctor being Matt Smith's final first-run episode to premiere in Australia. Unlike the classic series, which saw innumerable instances of censorship, both societal changes as well as changes to the television ratings classification system itself have meant that networks have been more free to show material that may not have been allowed to air at all in the 1960s or 1970s. Aside from some early references to violence or horror that was toned down or removed altogether in post-production the new series has generally been free from censorship. =Non-ABC screenings= UK.TV, a pay TV channel in Australia, also broadcast the old series, and after the free to air screening on the ABC it showed Series 1 of the new episodes (which began on 7 October 2006).UKTV Australia ‚Äì Programmes UK.TV Australia. Accessed on 20 October 2006 but the page is ephemeral The Series 1 finale first aired on 17 December 2006. The versions shown by UKTV were edited, meaning portions of each episode were not shown. Starting 2007, the repeats of the new series 2 have been accompanied by cut-down version episodes of Doctor Who Confidential, reportedly the first time that a broadcaster has shown this programme outside of the UK. SciFi Australia, another Australian pay TV channel, started screening all the Tom Baker stories from 17 August 2011. =Torchwood= Channel Ten has broadcast Davies' spin-off series, Torchwood, after both the ABC and SBS passed on buying the rights. The series premiered on 18 June 2007. Torchwood started to air every Monday at 9:30pm or 9:40pm ‚Äì depending on the programme preceding it ‚Äì for the first six episodes but was then moved to 12am Wednesday, apparently due to lower than anticipated ratings. Torchwood was bought by the ABC and series 1 and 2 were shown on ABC2 in 2009, on Fridays at 8.30 from 19 June, and followed by a cut version of Torchwood Declassified. Children of Earth was shown on Friday nights at 8:30 as well, however, only one episode was shown per week instead of the 'one per day over a week' format it was created for. Torchwood: Miracle Day (series four) has been bought by Eleven, a Network Ten digital only channel.Eleven snaps up Torchwood Information released on SFSA web site; story dated 19 July 2011  Australian connections with Doctor Who  Australians have played significant roles in the creation of Doctor Who ever since 1963. The first Doctor Who story to air, An Unearthly Child, was written by fellow Australian author Anthony Coburn. Another Australian, Bill Strutton, wrote the 1965 serial The Web Planet. The Doctor Who theme music was written by Australian composer Ron Grainer. In the early 1980s the Australian bush band Bullamakanka adapted the theme for their track \\"Ballad of Doctor Who\\", which paid homage to the series and its place in the ABC's early-evening weekday schedule and was released by BBC Records in November 1983.A Tweed Heads based band (Northern New South Wales), report \\"Dr Who Coup For Oz Band\\", in unspecified newspaper clipping, probably the Sydney Sun, in approx. May 1983. Also significant for his musical contribution to Doctor Who is Australian composer Dudley Simpson, who wrote the incidental music for a great number of stories during the 1960s and 1970s. On his retirement in the 1980s he returned to Australia and has appeared at numerous Australian Doctor Who- related events. The composer Tristram Cary, who lived in Australia for many years until his death in April 2008, also wrote incidental music for several serials. More visibly, many Australians ‚Äì or Britons with some connection to Australia ‚Äì have appeared on-screen in Doctor Who. The 1963 serial The Daleks featured several Australian actors: John Lee played Alydon, while Robert Jewell and Kevin Manser made their first contributions as Dalek operators, roles they revisited numerous times throughout the 1960s. Ilona Rodgers played Carol in the 1964 serial The Sensorites - Rodgers relocated to Australia in the late-1970s, then to New Zealand in the mid-1980s. Australian actor Ray Barrett played Bennett/Koquillion in the 1965 serial The Rescue. Australian actor David Nettheim and the South African-born Australian actor Bill Kerr both portrayed Australian characters in the 1967 serial The Enemy of the World. New Zealand-born actress Louise Pajo played Gia Kelly in the 1969 serial \\"The Seeds of Death\\" - Pajo completed her training in the UK before relocating to Australia during the 1970s. Katy Manning played companion Jo Grant 1971‚Äì73 and later lived in Australia for many years, becoming an Australian citizen and the patron of the Doctor Who Club of Australia. Australian actor Kevin Lindsay played Cho-Je in Planet of the Spiders, as well as various Sontarans in both The Time Warrior and The Sontaran Experiment. Australian actress Janet Fielding played companion Tegan 1981‚Äì84, while Fielding's contemporary Mark Strickson played companion Turlough 1983‚Äì84 - Strickson lived in Australia for many years before settling in New Zealand. British actress Liza Goddard played Kari in the 1983 serial Terminus - Goddard moved to Australia with her family in 1965 after her father's appointment as the ABC's Head of Drama and later starred in the first two seasons of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, before returning to the UK in 1969. Australian singer and actress Kylie Minogue played Astrid Peth in the 2007 Christmas special Voyage of the Damned and Australian actor Peter O'Brien played Ed Gold in the 2009 special The Waters of Mars. Australia itself has also featured in Doctor Who more than once, though without ever having been filmed or produced locally. The Second Doctor 1967‚Äì68 serial The Enemy of the World was set on and near an unnamed Australian beach in 2018 and featured a cast of characters who were supposed to be Australian, though virtually all were played by British actors. As well, in the Fifth Doctor 1982 serial Four to Doomsday, the main villain, Monarch, was said to have visited Earth in the distant past, gathering 'samples' of the local people as he went; included in his collection was an Aboriginal tribal elder and his tribesmen, following Monarch's visit to the Australian continent. A scene from the first episode of Series 10, The Pilot (premiered in Australia on 16 April 2017) was shot near Circular Quay, Sydney; the first Doctor Who scene shot in Australia. Lost Episodes in Australia Since some states differed in their school holiday dates, the ABC had no alternative but to have multiple copies of some of the early 16mm format episodes for different states. Hence it was hoped by fans in the 1990s that copies of episodes deemed lost by the BBC might yet be found in Australia, having been mis-shelved in the various state based offices of the ABC. The agreement with the BBC required that all such episodes should be destroyed or returned, although it is known that some were souvenired by staff, since at least five ended up in the hand of a private collector, and three were seen by some Sydney fans in the 1970s. But despite these, and a few episodes turning up in the ABC in the 1990s, nothing new has since come to light (as of March 2009). The ABC archive went through a major review following the closure of the ABC's old Sydney studio headquarters at Gore Hill, and many \\"lost\\" film and video resources were rediscovered and the ABC has also begun the process of archiving old film and video materials in digital format (such as segments from the 1970s pop music series GTK). However, no new Doctor Who finds have been reported to date. Censorship All overseas imported films had to be checked and classified by the Australian censors, so all stories were viewed by them, prior to purchase by the ABC. At this point some Doctor Who episodes failed to obtain a clearance for a pre 7pm timeslot, so they were not purchased by the ABC (such as The Daleks' Master Plan). Although, a few stories, such as the first two Dalek stories, despite being classified \\"A\\" (\\"not suitable for children\\"), were run in the first batch in 1965 because the ABC had initially scheduled the series to run after the national 7 PM news, so these stories were allowed to be screened at 7.30 PM. But they could not be repeated, as the ABC subsequently shifted the series from this later slot to the more family oriented time of 6.30 PM. In addition, stories could be accepted by the censors, but only if certain scenes, or even brief shots, were deleted. The issue of an \\"A\\" classification again became a problem with the Jon Pertwee era and several stories were not screened as a result, e.g. The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The D√¶mons, and The Mind of Evil). Only a few Tom Baker stories were thus rejected in full, such as The Deadly Assassin, and The Brain of Morbius. All were later re-classified and screened in the 1980s when the decision on these issues was decentralised down to the ABC, which passed these items. Some broadcast delays being due to poor quality videotapes (sourced from countries with differing video format, such as the USA), or to episode availability in black and white only (having originally been filmed in colour). In many cases some of the cuts now seem utterly inconsequential, and it is hard to imagine why anyone was bothered, but they stand as a testament to changing community values over the decades. In 1996, about 25 minutes worth of some very short censored black and white 16mm film clips were recovered from the National Archive vaults, snipped by the censor from a variety of 1960s episodes, these cut portions of 16mm film had not been in the hands of the ABC, and had been impounded by the Australian censors.For a fuller account of the issue of censorship, see Zerinza 38, edited by Damian Shanahan, with input from Antony Howe, giving information and detailed notes of the cuts and reasons for them. Merchandise Apart from imports of products from overseas, there have been a number of commercial products licensed to be made especially for the Australian market. Over the decades, the national broadcaster, the ABC, has produced a variety of items and promoted them vigorously on-air and in its shops. Several have basically been reprints of British products with the ABC logo on the covers replacing a British one, such as an Australian edition of what in Britain had been the \\"Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special\\" (in 1983). There was also a \\"Technical Manual\\" with supposed plans of Daleks, robots, the TARDIS, guns, K9 and sundry aliens. In 1980, sets of Tom Baker merchandise which included posters, cards, buttons, and writing sets, was also largely a reissue of British product, marketed in Australia from Sydney by an Ian Nichols who had moved from Britain to handle the items. These were vigorously promoted in Sydney by \\"Grace Brothers\\" (nothing to do with the BBC comedy series \\"Are You Being Served?\\") a chain of department stores, which brought Tom Baker out to conduct a whirlwind autographing blitz in its many suburban stores. But after that these items were not very successful. Other stray items have been \\"Show Bags\\" full of ephemeral bits and pieces, usually of a fairly poor quality for children, and sold at major \\"shows\\" (usually related to rural production with fun fairs and other activities) such as the \\"Royal Easter Show\\" in Sydney where the stall holder also distributed some leaflets to promote the national club, and he had plans to tour many rural towns throughout the state of New South Wales, and maybe to go further afield. A similar (or even identical) product was sold at the Royal Melbourne Show.A little information is in David J. Howe, Mark Stammers, and Stephen James Walker, Doctor Who: The Seventies, in sidebar: \\"Australian Merchandise\\" (Virgin 1994, p. 172). The distributor of BBC DVDs Roadshow has for several years issued the BBC product but for Australian format, and often with the address of the Australian club on the wrapping. Fandom =Pre-history= There may have been some isolated Australian branches of Keith Miller's British Doctor Who club,See David J. Howe, Mark Stammers, Stephen James Walker, \\"Fandom Grows Up\\", in Doctor Who: The Seventies, Virgin Books, 1994, pp. 173‚Äì4, Australia is only mentioned vaguely, p. 174.\\" and there was at least one small suburban club-ette in Sydney around 1974 (recalled by Kerrie Dougherty), as well as occasional signs of fan activity here and there (e.g. a fan organised film screening in Sydney of Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD in 1975, and an issue of a Tolkien fanzine devoted to Doctor Who, issued as \\"Macra\\" in late 1975.In reality issue 2 of Jon Noble's South of Harad, East of Rhun, Oct. 1975. But before 1976 there was no solid fan organisation. The last three of these strands came together at Sydney University in 1975‚Äì76, which led to the formation of a national club in August 1976. Members of the Sydney University Science Fiction Association (\\"SUSFA\\"), decided to build a Dalek to enter in a planned Dalek race to be held over Easter 1976 year to race other Daleks at a University Science Fiction Convention \\"Unicon 2\\" at Melbourne University over Easter (for photos of these Daleks and others, go to \\"External Links\\" below for the site \\"Daleksdownunder\\"). Although the Melbourne students had built their Dalek in 1975, and Adelaide students also built one, there is no evidence either group went on to form a Doctor Who club. However, after winning this race the SUSFA members were fired up and organised screenings of both Dalek films, and arranged a number of other activities involving the Dalek around campus at Sydney University during 1976.Reported on in several issues of the Student newspaper, Honi Soit, No. 9, 27 April 1976, \\"Dalek Victory\\" on the Sports' Page, p. 15; No. 12, 15 June 1976 cover and interior articles; 12 A (no date), p. 3; No. 23, 28 Sept. 1976, p. 3. But why this led to a dedicated Doctor Who club at Sydney University and not elsewhere must remain a mystery. Perhaps their Daleks were just student pranks, and not signs of dedicated fan obsession. The change at Sydney into a Doctor Who fanclub with fanzine (Zerinza) requires an outline of some of the broadcasting context as it related to fans (in more detail above). By the mid-1970s the series was not rating well and the ABC used less and less new material every year, slowly getting well over a year behind the BBC's screenings in Britain, and missing several stories. Fed up with such sporadic sequencing during 1974‚Äì77, a Sydney fan, Antony Howe, began to agitate to have the series shown in full, and soon after the premieres in Britain rather than being screened years later. Other demands were to stop the censorship of whole stories (many had been rated \\"A\\" by the censor, limited to screening after 7.30 pm which the ABC refused to do), and to have more repeats. Such criticisms were made public in the special \\"Dalek Soit\\" science fiction edition of the famous student newspaper Honi Soit which featured news and photographs of the club Dalek's conquest of the campus, and an appreciative quasi-academic article on the Doctor Who TV series, by local science fiction author Terry Dowling.Dowling, \\"Space Opera Plus: The Achievement of Dr. Who\\", Honi Soit, no. 12, 15 June 1976, p. 4, and Howe, \\"Science Fiction Action\\", p. 5. Also flagged was the launch of a Doctor Who fanzine (see Zerinza) and addresses were given for overseas Doctor Who fan clubs, so a local club was not yet envisaged. This rapidly changed, however, as petitions and letter writing campaigns got nowhere. After being fobbed off again in mid-1976 by the ABC, Howe, by then the new President of the SUSFA, brought the matter up with the Uni. club for action. SUSFA had several other active members who were keen Doctor Who fans, such as Kerrie Dougherty, Dallas Jones, and Jon Noble (who also published a roneoed Tolkien fanzine, South of Harad, East of Rhun, with material on the Daleks, etc., in some issues). The SUSFA agreed that in the August vacation it would hold a protest at the ABC Head office in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, complete with the SUSFA's Dalek. The \\"Demo\\" was to urge more screenings. =The 1976 Save Doctor Who campaign= During the vacation Antony Howe learned the ABC had actually decided to cease purchasing ANY new episodes of the series, and the planned \\"Dalek Demo\\" now had a more urgent goal ‚Äì to \\"Save Doctor Who\\". Organised by Howe, SUSFA members and others, the \\"Dalek Demo\\" of 24 August 1976 helped create a small core of people who formed fandom in Sydney, then the rest of Australia, but only about 20 turned up at the peak, with a dozen people or so were present at other times. Even ABC Programme Dept. staff said they knew nothing about the top level decision. Management's decision was also widely revealed in the student newspaper and fans urged to begin a letter writing campaign, and to join the new Australasian Dr Who Fan Club, and attend a screening of the film Doctor Who and the Daleks where further details were announced.Howe, \\"Dr Who to End, A.B.C. Decides!\\", Honi Soit, No. 23, 28 Sept. 1976, p. 3. Thus was a longer term campaign to \\"Save Doctor Who\\" had been launched: complete with posters and leaflets; networking with existing Science Fiction enthusiasts around the country; a radio interview; and letter writing campaigns to the rest of the media, not just the ABC. The \\"Demo\\" and other efforts are widely thought by fans and others to have encouraged the broadcaster to change its mind.So credited by journalist Jan Balodis, \\"Dr Who's Monstrous success\\", in Look and Listen (a short-lived publication by the ABC, Jan. 1985, p. 44. Howe, however, has doubts that such a small \\"Demo,\\" and club, had much effect on a huge bureaucracy like the ABC. Eventually the ABC did buy the new series (season 2 and 3 of Tom Baker), Howe believes this was probably due to the high ratings in Britain, rather than to his own efforts. The campaign did however, lead to a fan magazine and club. Reporting on the \\"Demo\\" and associated activities, Howe formed a club, linked up with the UK club (DWAS), and launched his fanzine \\"Zerinza: the Australasian Doctor Who Fanzine\\" in August 1976 at a Sydney University screening of \\"Dr. Who and the Daleks\\" he had organised for SUSFA (on 21 Sept. 1976).Announced in Honi Soit, no. 23, 28 Sept. 1976, p. 3. His fanzine was only possible because the SUSFA had a printing machine for its own fanzine \\"Enigma.\\" Its editor-printer, Van Ikin kindly printed the first 3 years or so of \\"Zerinza\\" for Howe. \\"Zerinza\\" was claimed to be a Dalek word for \\"Good Success\\" in a Dalek Annual of the 1960s. The 'zine was available at fan events and some specialist shops (\\"Galaxy\\" in Sydney, and \\"Space Age\\" in Melbourne), but it was mainly sold through the post, appearing with some (more or less) regularity every year with the last routine issue #35 in mid-1984. The associated club was announced in the first issue, but held no public or regular meetings until November 1979 as it so completely overlapped with the SUSFA in membership that there was no point in holding separate activities until the students had mostly graduated and moved on. Initially all \\"Zerinza\\" subscribers were notionally members of the \\"Australasian Doctor Who Fan Club\\" run by Antony Howe with the help of his mother who did much of the typing, and articles by other members of SUSFA and increasingly outside people who networked as part of the ongoing protest over the ABC policy toward the series. The broadcaster abruptly changed its mind with a new Controller of TV and from 1978 the series was to be screened with great regularity. =The Doctor Who Club of Australia= Initially called The Australasian Doctor Who Fan Club, this, the nationwide club, is also the oldest and largest Doctor Who club in Australia, formed in 1976, but initially closely entwined with the SUSFA (see above). By 1979, with the visit of Tom Baker to promote the series for the ABC, Doctor Who fandom was increasingly separate from SUSFA and other university based clubs around the country. The visit by Baker also stimulated a greater level of fan activity in Melbourne and Brisbane with clubs forming there as well. After Antony Howe resigned as President of SUSFA in 1980, he remained with the ADWFC organising a series of events, the fanzine, and a mail order business of imported Doctor Who merchandise, often unavailable in dozens of tiny rural towns outside the main cities. The ADWFC's most successful event to then was in mid-1980, when Jon Pertwee toured Sydney for cabaret shows, and kindly attended a half-day \\"Dr Who Party.\\" Having its founders and core workers resident in Sydney, with the ABC head office there as well, the club administration has thus been based in the state of New South Wales, and therefore runs the main club events in Sydney. These headquarters in Sydney and heavy focus on Sydney-based events led Doctor Who fan leadership elsewhere in Australia, particularly in Melbourne, to insultingly refer to the DWCA as \\"the Sydney club\\".http://davidj.richardson.name/ From 1979, there were \\"parties\\" held multiple times most years, but conventions were seen as too expensive to risk until 1988's \\"Console 88\\" event, featuring Katy Manning, Mark Strickson, Julie Brennan and other guests who could be sourced locally, then in 1990, when Nicholas Courtney best known for his role as the Brigadier was flown out to be the main guest at the first \\"Whovention\\". Howe had issued a few one-off newsletters to announce the Baker and Pertwee visits, and as the fanzine was often months late, Dallas Jones offered to produce a more regular newsletter, and Howe agreed, helping with typing, proof reading, and printing it using the SUSFA printing machine, thus the future \\"Data Extract\\" was launched. When Antony Howe resigned from the Presidency of the ADWFC in 1984, and ceased regular publication of Zerinza, he was succeeded by Dallas Jones, who also edited a few special issues of Zerinza. Other presidents include Kate Orman, Neil Hogan, Todd Beilby, James Sellwood and Karen Carpenter. The current president is Lauren Davis. Over the years, as the national club, the DWCA had several name shifts, and a changing number of regional chapters around the country, and a few of these are part of the state based clubs listed below. The club still publishes the regular club magazine \\"Data Extract\\" which has had an unbroken run of publication since 1980. The club continues to offer a large range of merchandise for sale through the club's merchandise store at the club's website. =Other clubs and groups= The Supreme Council of Time Lords introduced the first Australian and New Zealand fan award system, the Double Gammas, open to all Australia and New Zealand Doctor Who fanzines, fan writers, fan artists, with fans members of any Australian or New Zealand Doctor Who club or readers of any Australian or New Zealand Doctor Who fanzine or newsletter, able to nominate and vote. These awards were first presented in 1984 at \\"Who Do 84\\", during the Time Lord Ball. Australia also has a number of regional state-based clubs.Dr Who interview on George Negus Tonight broadcast 15 September 2003 The Queensland Doctor Who Fan Club was formed in about 1978. It closed in late 1980,See Zerinza #17, 1980. but other successor clubs almost immediately sprang up, usually affiliated to the national club, such as the Brisbane Doctor Who Fan Club (closed 2000).Martin Dunne 'Death of a Club' in SFSA # 18, (SFSA/SADWFC, 2005) The South Australian Doctor Who Fan Club was formed on 1 June 1980A History of the S.A.D.W.F.C 1980‚Äì2001 dated 4 July 2005 and incorporated on 7 September 1982. It held Conpanion, the first Australian Doctor Who convention, on 8 to 11 October 1983 with Katy Manning as Guest of Honour. On 18 November 2000 the club was rebranded as Science Fiction South Australia. It meets from 3pm to 10pm on the third Saturday of each month except December at Adelaide High School. Publications include the Doctor Who yearbook \\"Chameleon Factor\\", regular general SF magazine \\"SFSA\\" and the bi- monthly newsletter \\"The Wall of Lies\\". The Western Australian Doctor Who Club known legally as The West Lodge Inside The Blue Box Incorporated. was formed in July 1983 following a Myer signing by Peter Davison earlier that year. The club has been meeting on the first Saturday of the Month since then and is still running over 30 years later. League of Doctors was created in 2010 at Supanova Sydney. Their aim is to showcase all of the Doctor, past and present, including Peter Cushing from the Dr. Who (Dalek films) and David Tennant's left hand for all conventions across Australia. They also look to have accompanying assistants or companions for each Doctor. The current president of the League of Doctors is Jacob Moriarty who took over from Bron Mitchell and Sean C. Berry in 2012. The Doctor Who Club of Victoria (DWCV) was founded in 1979, based in Melbourne, and has had mixed relations with the Sydney-based DWCA over the years because of Melbourne and Sydney's long term rivalry. =Conventions= During the 1980s there had been many large scale fan events in various cities (see above), some rather grandly called \\"conventions,\\" others by the less grand label \\"parties.\\" There is a little information on the names and dates of a wide variety of conventions in the article on the Double Gammas, the Australian Doctor Who fan awards.

Brembate di Sopra borders the following municipalities: Almenno San Bartolomeo, Barzana, Mapello, Ponte San Pietro, Valbrembo.  History  The first urbanization here was the work of the Romans, mindful of the strategic importance of the nearby road connecting Bergamo to Como. Archeological finds have confirmed the existence of Roman military camps in the area. The region was subsequently dominated by the Lombards who included it within the Duchy of Bergamo. The district is often included as part of Lemine during this period. The earliest written records of Brembate date back to 856.

The Italian peninsula has been a centre of military conflict throughout European history: because of this, Italy has a long military tradition. Today Italy is the 8th country by Military Strength Index.  Ancient Italy  Etruscan funerary urn crowned with the sculpture of a woman and a front-panel relief showing two warriors fighting, polychrome terracotta, c. 150 BC In the 8th century BC, a group of Italic tribes (Latins in the west, Sabines in the upper valley of the Tiber, Umbrians in the north-east, Samnites in the South, Oscans and others) shared the Italian peninsula with two other major ethnic groups: the Etruscans in the North, and the Greeks in the south. Etruscan bronze helmet The Etruscans (Etrusci or Tusci in Latin) were settled north of Rome in Etruria (modern northern Lazio, Tuscany and part of Umbria). They founded cities like Tarquinia, Veii and Volterra and deeply influenced Roman culture, as clearly shown by the Etruscan origin of some of the mythical Roman kings. The origins of the Etruscans are lost in prehistory. Historians have no literature, no texts of religion or philosophy; therefore much of what is known about this civilization is derived from grave goods and tomb findings.Larissa Bonfante:Etruscan Inscriptions and Etruscan Religion in The Religion of the Etruscans - University of Texas Press 2006, page 9 The Italics were war-like as the Etruscans (the gladiatorial displays actually evolved out of Etruscan funerary customs). The Italics and the Etruscans had a significant military tradition. In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals in their culture, warfare was a considerable economic boon to their civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Italics and the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months, raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combating piracy/banditism as a means of acquiring valuable resources such as land, prestige and goods. It is also likely individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost. The Greeks had founded many colonies in Southern Italy (that the Romans later called Magna Graecia), such as Cumae, Naples and Taranto, as well as in the eastern two-thirds of Sicily, between 750 and 550 BC. After 650 BC, the Etruscans became dominant in central Italy, and expanded into north Italy founding cities like Mutina (actual Modena) and Felsina (actual Bologna). Roman tradition claimed that Rome had been under the control of seven \\"etruscan\\" kings from 753 to 509 BC beginning with the mythic Romulus who along with his brother Remus were said to have founded the city of Rome. The northern part of Italy was called Cisalpine Gaul because of the presence of Celtic tribes and the strong influence they had on the region. Non-Celtic people like Ligurians in the western part, and Adriatic Veneti in the eastern, also existed and were the majority of population of Cisalpine Gaul, although they were very influenced by Celts in their culture, and warfare was no exception. The Ligurians practised warfare mainly by ambush and their weaponry was very similar to the Celtic one; the early warfare of Veneti indeed was very similar to the italic, Greek, and illirian ones (e.g. with hoplites and phalanx), but later emerges use of typical Celtic weapons and tactics. These many tribes were not united and often disagreed or even conflicted with each other. Tribal warfare was a regular feature of Celtic societies, using war to exercise political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some cases to conquer territory. An example in this area was the fight between the Celtic Insubres and the Taurini (Ligurian) that Hannibal intervened at, when he went to Italy just after crossing the Alps. The Cisalpine Celtic and Ligurian populations were sought after as mercenaries in the wars of the ancient world, until they were subjected to Rome between the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C.

It was small (the population of free males of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the comitia centuriata, the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.John Keegan, A History of Warfare, Alfred A. Knopf (New York 1993) , p.263; David Potter, \\"The Roman Army and Navy,\\" in Harriet I. Flower, editor, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic, Cambridge University Press (Cambridge U.K. 2004) , pp. 67-69. For a discussion of hoplite tactics and their sociocultural setting, see Victor Davis Hanson, The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece, Alfred A. Knopf (New York 1989) . By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favor of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or in some cases 60) men called maniples could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a legion, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 men. The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (hastati, principes and triarii), a force of light infantry (velites), and the cavalry (equites). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.Keegan, p. 264; Potter, pp. 69-70. Early Roman legionaries (\\"Oath of the Horatii\\") At nominal full strength, an early Republican legion would have included 3,600 to 4,800 heavy infantry, several hundred light infantry and several hundred cavalrymen, for a total of 4,000 to 5,000 men.Keegan, p.264; Adrian Goldsworthy, The Roman Army at War 100 BC ‚Äî CE200, Oxford University Press (Oxford 1996) , p. 33; Jo-Ann Shelton, ed., As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History, Oxford University Press (New York 1998), pp. 245-249. Legions were often significantly understrength from recruitment failures or following periods of active service due to accidents, battle casualties, disease and desertion. During the Civil War, Pompey's legions in the east were at full strength because recently recruited, while Caesar's legions were in many cases well below nominal strength after long active service in Gaul. This pattern also held true for auxiliary forces.Goldsworthy, The Roman Army, pp. 22-24, 37-38; Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus, Yale University Press (New Haven 2006) [, ], pp. 384, 410-411, 425-427. Another important factor discussed by Goldsworthy was absence of legionaries on detached duty. Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural area (an adsiduus) who served for particular (often annual) campaigns,Between 343 BC and 241 BC, the Roman army fought every year except for five. Stephen P. Oakley, \\"The Early Republic,\\" in Harriet I. Flower, editor, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic, Cambridge University Press (Cambridge U.K. 2004) , p. 27. and who supplied his own equipment and, in the case of equites, his own mount. Harris suggests that down to 200 BC, the average rural farmer (who survived) might participate in six or seven campaigns. Freedmen and slaves (wherever resident) and urban citizens did not serve except in rare emergencies.P. A. Brunt, \\"Army and Land in the Roman Republic,\\" in The Fall of the Roman Republic and Related Essays, Oxford University Press (Oxford 1988) , p.253; William V. Harris, War and Imperialism in Republican Rome 327-70 BC, Oxford University Press (Oxford 1979) , p. 44. After 200 BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for service were gradually reduced. Beginning with Gaius Marius in 107 BC, citizens without property and some urban-dwelling citizens (proletarii) were enlisted and provided with equipment, although most legionaries continued to come from rural areas. Terms of service became continuous and long‚Äîup to twenty years if emergencies required it although Brunt argues that six or seven years was more typical.Keegan, pp. 273-274; Brunt, pp. 253-259; Harris, pp. 44-50. Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid stipendium (amounts are disputed but Caesar famously \\"doubled\\" payments to his troops to 225 denarii a year), could anticipate booty and donatives (distributions of plunder by commanders) from successful campaigns and, beginning at the time of Marius, often were granted allotments of land upon retirement.Keegan, p. 264; Brunt, pp. 259-265; Potter, pp. 80-83. Cavalry and light infantry attached to a legion (the auxilia) were often recruited in the areas where the legion served. Caesar formed a legion, the Fifth Alaudae, from non-citizens in Transalpine Gaul to serve in his campaigns in Gaul.Goldsworthy, Caesar, pp. 391. By the time of Caesar Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. Legionaries were paid 900 sesterces a year and could expect a payment of 12,000 sesterces on retirement.Karl Christ, The Romans, University of California Press (Berkeley, 1984), pp. 74-76 . At the end of the Civil War, Augustus reorganized Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire.Christopher S. Mackay, Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History, Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge, U.K. 2004), pp. 249-250. Mackay points out that the number of legions (not necessarily the number of legionaries) grew to 30 by 125 AD and 33 during the Severan period (200‚Äì235 AD). During the Principate, the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The auxilia remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit, the cohortes equitatae, combining cavalry and legionaries in a single formation could be stationed at garrisons or outposts, could fight on their own as balanced small forces or could combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility over time helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.Goldsworthy, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Roman Army‚Äô‚Äô, p.36-37. The Emperor Gallienus (253‚Äì268 AD) began a reorganization that created the final military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the Comitatenses or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. The border troops (limitanei) stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defense. The basic unit of the field army was the \\"regiment\\", legiones or auxilia for infantry and vexillationes for cavalry. Evidence suggests that nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, although many records show lower actual troop levels (800 and 400). Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a comes. In addition to Roman troops, the field armies included regiments of \\"barbarians\\" recruited from allied tribes and known as foederati. By 400 AD, foederati regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. In addition to the foederati, the Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as \\"allies\\" without integration into the field armies. Under the command of the senior Roman general present, they were led at lower levels by their own officers.Hugh Elton, Warfare in Roman Europe AD 350-425, Oxford University Press (Oxford 1996) pp. 89-96. Military leadership evolved greatly over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies would have been led by the kings of Rome. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected consuls for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the cursus honorum, would have served first as quaestor (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as praetor. Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a propraetor or proconsul (depending on the highest office previously held) to govern a foreign province. More junior officers (down to but not including the level of centurion) were selected by their commanders from their own clientelae or those recommended by political allies among the Senatorial elite.T. Correy Brennan, \\"Power and Process Under the Republican 'Constitution',\\" in Harriet I. Flower, editor, The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic, Cambridge University Press (Cambridge U.K. 2004) , Chapter 2; Potter, pp. 66-88; Goldsworthy, The Roman Army, pp. 121-125. Julius Caesar's most talented, effective and reliable subordinate in Gaul, Titus Labienus, was recommended to him by Pompey. Goldsworthy, The Roman Army, p. 124. Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a legatus (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate would command the legion (legatus legionis) and also serve as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion would be commanded by a legate and the legates would be commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).Mackay, pp. 245-252. During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with Diocletian), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals (duces) appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors who had appointed them. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighboring barbarian peoples.MacKay, pp. 295-296 and Chapters 23-24. Comparatively less is known about the Roman navy than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century BC, officials known as duumviri navales commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278 AD and replaced by allied forces. The First Punic War required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The quinquereme was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more maneuverable vessels. As compared with a trireme, the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser maneuverability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect boarding tactics using a troop of approximately 40 marines in lieu of the ram. Ships were commanded by a navarch, a rank equivalent to a centurion, who were usually not citizens. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.This paragraph is based upon Potter, pp. 76-78. Available information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350 AD), the Roman navy comprised a number of fleets including both warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft (classes) were part of the limitanei (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbors along the Rhine and the Danube. The fact that prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known although it is known that fleets were commanded by prefects.This discussion is based upon Elton, pp. 97-99 and 100-101.  Middle Ages  Suit of armor of the condottiero Roberto da Sanseverino, captured after his death at the Battle of Calliano (1487). Throughout the Middle Ages, from the collapse of a central Roman government in the late 5th century to the Italian Wars of the Renaissance, Italy was constantly divided between opposing factions fighting for control. At the time of the deposition of Romulus Augustulus (476), the Heruli Confederation governed Italy, but it was displaced by the Ostrogoths, who fought a long war with the Byzantine army in Italy (the Gothic War). The Byzantine came out of the war victorious only to find Italy invaded by a new wave of barbarians led by the Lombards. The Lombards diminished Byzantine territory to the Exarchate of Ravenna, the Duchy of Rome, the Duchy of Naples, and the far south of Apulia and Calabria. They established a kingdom centred on Pavia in the north. During the interregnum called the Rule of the Dukes (574‚Äì584), the dukes of the Lombards invaded Burgundy, but were repulsed by the Merovingian king Guntram, who in turn invaded Italy and took the region of Savoy. The Lombards were forced to elect a new king to organise their defence. For the next two centuries, the Byzantine power in the peninsula was reduced by the Lombard kings, the greatest of which was Liutprand, until it consisted of little more than the tips of the Italian toe and heel, Rome and its environs being practically independent under the popes and the Neapolitan coast under its dukes. In 774, Charlemagne of the Franks invaded and conquered the Lombard kingdom. In the south of the peninsula, the Duchy of Benevento remained independent of Frankish dominion, however. During the period of Carolingian strength, Charlemagne's descendants governed the north of Italy in relative peace, except for the brief period of the rebellion of Bernard and the constant raids from the Slavs to the east and the Saracens to the south. Pirates harassed the Adriatic and Ligurian coasts and the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. The south was very different, as the Lombards were at the height of there power there. Warfare between Lombard and Greek, especially the Greek city-states of the Tyrrhenian, was endemic. The Greek cities fell out of the orbit of Constantinople and Byzantine possessions shrank to their smallest mark as the Lombards and the Saracens increased their predations. In 831, the Arabs conquered Palermo and in 902 they conquered Taormina, ending the conquest of Sicily. They likewise established their presence on the peninsula, especially on the Garigliano and in Bari. The story of the incessant conflicts of the states of the Mezzogiorno is chaotic until the arrival of the Normans in the early 11th century (1016). Under their leadership, the Jews of the south found themselves eventually united, the Arabs expelled, and the whole Mezzogiorno subjugated to the Hauteville dynasty of kings of Sicily (1130). The second half of the Middle Ages in Italy was marked by frequent conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy, the latter eventually emerging victorious in that it ultimately prevented political unification of northern Italy under Imperial rule. Imperial invasions were led by more or less all medieval Emperors, the most notable episodes being the end of the Investiture controversy by the pilgrimage of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor at Canossa in 1077 and the no less than five major invasions staged by Frederick Barbarossa against the Lombard League, culminating in the sack of Milan in 1162, after which every building in the city was demolished, except the churches. The lasting conflict led to the emergence of the Guelph and the Ghibelline parties in northern Italy, supporting respectively the Pope (and the independent cities) and the Emperor, though siding with a party was often dictated by other political considerations (more or less each city has belonged to both parties). In May 1176, the Lombard League, led by a revived Milan, defeated the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Legnano. The victory of the Guelph party meant the end of Imperial overlordship over northern Italy, and the formation of city-states such as Florence, Venice, Milan, Genoa or Siena. While Venice was turning to the seas, supporting, and acquiring large loot from, the 1204 Fourth Crusade's sack of Constantinople, the other city-states were struggling for control of mainland, Florence being the rising power of the time (annexation of Pisa in 1406). Sicily was invaded in 1266 by Charles I, duke of Anjou; the Angevines were however toppled in the 1282 Sicilian Vespers, and Peter III of Aragon invaded the island. This set the background for later French claims over Naples and Sicily. Disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire and the Hundred Years War in neighbouring France meant that Italy was more or less left in peace during the 15th century; this allowed its cities to grow rich and to become attractive preys for its neighbours during the 16th century.  Italian Wars  Italy in 1494, before the invasion of Charles VIII of France. The relative peace that had prevailed in Italy following the Treaty of Lodi was shattered by the beginning of the Italian Wars in 1494. Ludovico Sforza, seeking allies, suggested to Charles VIII of France that the latter press his claim to the throne of Naples; Charles obliged and launched an invasion of the peninsula. The French march to, and capture of, Naples was accomplished with relative ease‚Äîthe Italian states being shocked at the brutality of French tactics and the efficacy of the new French artillery‚Äîbut Charles was forced to withdraw from Italy in 1495, after a hastily constructed alliance fought him at the Battle of Fornovo. Charles died in 1498, but the conflict he started would be continued by his successors; the Italian Wars would last until 1559, involving, at various times, all the major states of western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, Scotland, the Republic of Venice, the Papal States, and most of the city-states of Italy) as well as the Ottoman Empire, and rapidly becoming a general struggle for power and territory among the various participants, marked with an increasing degree of alliances, counter-alliances, and regular betrayals. In 1499, Louis XII of France launched the Second Italian War, invading Lombardy and seizing the Duchy of Milan. He then reached an agreement with Ferdinand I of Spain to divide Naples. By 1502, combined French and Spanish forces had seized control of the Kingdom; disagreements about the terms of the partition led to a war between Louis and Ferdinand. By 1503, Louis, having been defeated at the Battle of Cerignola and Battle of Garigliano, was forced to withdraw from Naples, which was left under the control of the Spanish viceroy, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. Meanwhile, Pope Alexander VI attempted to carve a Borgia state from the Romagna through the efforts of Cesare Borgia. In 1508, Pope Julius II formed the League of Cambrai, in which France, the Papacy, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire agreed to attack the Republic of Venice and partition her mainland territories.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 196‚Äì197; Norwich, History of Venice, 394‚Äì395. The resulting War of the League of Cambrai was a kaleidoscope of shifting alliances. The French defeated the Venetian army at the Battle of Agnadello, capturing extensive territories; but Julius, now regarding France as a greater threat, left the League and allied himself with Venice.Norwich, History of Venice, 399‚Äì415; Taylor, Art of War, 119. After a year of fighting over the Romagna, he proclaimed a Holy League against the French; this rapidly grew to include England, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 216‚Äì227; Norwich, History of Venice, 417. The French were driven from Italy in late 1512, despite their victory at the Battle of Ravenna earlier that year, leaving Milan in the hands of Maximilian Sforza and his Swiss mercenaries; but the Holy League fell apart over the subject of dividing the spoils, and in 1513 Venice allied with France, agreeing to partition Lombardy between them.Norwich, History of Venice, 422‚Äì425; Oman, Art of War, 152. The French invasion of Milan in 1513 was defeated at the Battle of Novara, which was followed by a series of defeats for the French alliance; but Francis I of France defeated the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano in 1515, and the treaties of Noyon and Brussels left France and Venice in control of northern Italy.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 280‚Äì290; Norwich, History of Venice, 429‚Äì432; Oman, Art of War, 153‚Äì154; Taylor, Art of War, 67, 123. The election of Charles of Spain as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 led to a collapse of relations between France and the Habsburgs which resulted in the Italian War of 1521, in which France and Venice were pitted against England, the Papacy, and Charles's Habsburg possessions. Prosper Colonna defeated the French at the Battle of Bicocca, driving them from Lombardy.Arfaioli, Black Bands, 10‚Äì11; Guicciardini, History of Italy, 335; Norwich, History of Venice, 439; Oman, Art of War, 176‚Äì186; Taylor, Art of War, 51. A series of abortive invasions of France by the allies and of Italy by the French continued until 1524, when Francis personally led a French army into Lombardy, only to be defeated and captured at the Battle of Pavia; imprisoned in Madrid, Francis was forced to agree to extensive concessions. Released in 1526, Francis repudiated the terms of the agreement, allied himself with Venice, the Papacy, Milan, and England, and launched the War of the League of Cognac. In 1527, Imperial troops sacked Rome itself; the French expedition to capture Naples the next year failed, leading Francis and Charles to conclude the Treaty of Cambrai. Charles then concluded a series of treaties at Barcelona and Bologna which eliminated all his opponents save the Florentine Republic, which was subdued by the Siege of Florence and returned to the Medici. The remainder of the Italian Wars‚Äîwhich flared up again in 1535‚Äîwas primarily a struggle between the Habsburgs and the Valois; while Italy was, at times, a battlefield, the Italian states played little further role in the fighting. The French managed to seize and hold Turin, defeating an Imperial army at the Battle of Ceresole in 1544; but the warfare continued (primarily in northern France) until Henry II of France was forced to accept the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis in 1559, in which he renounced any further claims to Italy. By the end of the wars in 1559, Habsburg Spain had been established as the premier power of Europe, to the detriment of France. The states of Italy, which had wielded power disproportionate to their size during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, were reduced to second-rate powers or destroyed entirely. The Italian Wars had a number of consequences for the work and workplace of Leonardo da Vinci; his plans for a \\"Gran Cavallo\\" horse statue in 1495 were dropped when the seventy tons of bronze intended for the statue were instead cast into weapons to save Milan. Later, following a chance encounter with Francis I after the Battle of Marignano, Leonardo agreed to move to France, where he spent his final years. In France, Henry II was fatally wounded in a joust held during the celebrations of the peace. His death led to the accession of his 15-year-old son Francis II, who in turn soon died. The French monarchy was thrown into turmoil, which increased further with the outbreak of the French Wars of Religion in 1562. Early modern period  = Partial foreign domination = Following the Italian Wars (1494 to 1559), Italy saw a long period of relative peace, however, Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sicily) and the Duchy of Milan were under the control of the Spanish Empire from 1559 to 1713. And then, in the case of Milan under the Habsburg Monarchy from 1714 to 1796. During the French Revolutionary Wars, Italy became the scene of the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1796, Italy was invaded by French forces under the command of general Napoleon Bonaparte (later King of Italy). Italy was conquered by the French and became organized into French client republics. The Congress of Vienna (1814) restored the situation of the late 18th century, which was however quickly overturned by the incipient movement of Italian unification. = 18th century =  Piedmont  In 1700 the army was the main instrument used by the Savoy sovereigns (such as Victor Amedeus II and his successor Charles Emanuel III), who assured Piedmont its territorial expansion and the rise to European power, participating in the main wars that broke out in the period (wars of succession of Spain, Poland and Austria ). It is no coincidence that in this period Piedmont was called \\"the Italian Prussia\\". During the whole century there was a general tendency to enlarge the army, in 1774 the total number of Savoyan troops reached 100.000 units and it was in that occasion that the regulation concerning the duration of the permanent military service was introduced.  Naples  In 1734 there was the passage of the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily from Habsburg to Bourbon rule as a result of the war of Polish succession. In the two previous centuries southern Italy and Sicily were part of the Spanish Empire as viceroys; later, in 1707, the Kingdom of Naples passed to Austria as part of the war of Spanish succession, while the Kingdom of Sicily was given to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy in 1713 with the peace of Utrecht. The official date of birth of the Neapolitan army is however linked to the law of 25 November 1743, by which King Charles ordered the constitution of 12 provincial regiments, all composed of citizens of the Kingdom. In the spring of the following year the newborn army underwent its first test against the Austria at the Battle of Velletri. It marked its first great victory, in which entirely Neapolitan regiments took part, such as the \\"Terra di Lavoro\\" (which after the battle could boast the title of \\"Real\\", reserved only for veteran regiments).  Venice  On April 26, 1729 the Senate approved the military reform proposed by Marshal Count Schulenburg. On the basis of this reform, the land army was in peacetime composed of 20460 men. Venice fought the Turkish in seventh Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, one particular episode of this conflict was the battle of Corfu in 1716-1717 where 70,000 Turks tried to conquer the island then garrisoned by about 5,000 Venetian infantrymen, here at the end of the siege the Ottomans left on the field over 5,000 dead and 20 banners against just 400 dead Venetians, in 1784 there was an expedition led by Admiral Angelo Emo against the barbary pirate concluded with the bombing of the fort of Susa. The republic in 1788 had an army of about 30,000 units with the possibility to increase the number through the use of local militias also called cernide. At the end of the Republic the Venetian military instrument was remarkable for the Italian averages (probably the third largest army in Italy).  Italian Unification and colonial period  Giuseppe Garibaldi leading the Expedition of the Thousand. The Italian unification (Italian: il Risorgimento, or \\"The Resurgence\\") was the political and social movement that unified different states of the Italian peninsula into the kingdom of Italy. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of Italian unification, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the Congress of Vienna in 1814, and approximately ended with the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and the conquest of Rome, though Trento and Triest (the last citt√† irredente, cities that Italian nationalists considered as Italian under foreign domination) did not join the Kingdom of Italy until after World War I. The First (1848‚Äì1849), Second (1859) and Third Italian War of Independence (1866) were fought against the Austrian Empire as part of the process to unify the Italian peninsula. The kingdom of Italy did not participate in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, but the defeat of France and the abdication of French emperor Napoleon III enabled Italy to capture Rome (the city was de jure declared the capital of Italy in 1861Nel 1861 Roma fu proclamata capitale d'Italia - La Provincia (laprovincia.it)), the last remnant of the Papal States (ruled by the Catholic church). The military and political protection provided to the Papal States by Napoleon III had until then prevented this. = Italian conquest of Eritrea and Somalia = Italy took part in the scramble for Africa (the European conquest and colonization of Africa that started in the late 19th century). Between 1881 and 1905 Italy colonized parts of the Horn of Africa, forming the colonies of Eritrea and Italian Somalia, but the conquest of Ethiopia was stopped at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. = Boxer Rebellion = Italian warships and infantry took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900). = The conquest of Libya = During the Italo-Turkish War (1911‚Äì1912) Italy occupied Tripolitania and Cyrenaica that later were unified in the colony of Libya. Italy also conquered the Dodecanese island group in the Aegean Sea. In this war Italy pioneered the military use of aircraft and airships (for bombing, artillery spotting and reconnaissance).  World War I  Italian cavalry in Trento during the Battle of Vittorio Veneto In spite of its official status as member of the Triple Alliance together with Germany and Austria-Hungary, in the years before the outbreak of the conflict the Italian government had enhanced its diplomatic efforts towards United Kingdom and France. This was because the Italian government had grown convinced that a support of Austria (which had been also the traditional enemy of Italy during the 19th century Risorgimento) would not grant to Italy the Italian-speaking lands the country was aiming for in its territorial expansion: Trieste, Istria, Zara and Dalmatia, all Austrian possessions. In fact, a secret agreement signed with France in 1902 practically nullified Italy's membership in the Triple Alliance. A few days after the outbreak of the conflict, on 3 August 1914, the government, led by the conservative Antonio Salandra, declared that Italy would not commit its troops, maintaining that the Triple Alliance had only a defensive stance, whereas Austria-Hungary had been the aggressor. In reality, both Salandra and the minister of Foreign Affairs, Sidney Sonnino, started diplomatic activities to probe which side was ready to grant the best reward for Italy's entrance in the war. Although the majority of the cabinet (including former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti) was firmly contrary to the intervention, numerous intellectuals, including socialists such as Ivanoe Bonomi, Leonida Bissolati and Benito Mussolini, declared in favour of the intervention, which was then mostly supported by the Nationalist and the Liberal parties. The diplomatic moves led to the London Pact (26 April 1915), signed by Sonnino without the approval of the Italian Parliament. By the Pact, in case of victory Italy was to be given Trentino and the South Tyrol up to the Brenner Pass, the entire Austrian Littoral (with Trieste, Gorizia-Gradisca and Istria, but without Fiume), parts of western Carniola (Idrija and Ilirska Bistrica) and north-western Dalmatia with Zadar and most of the islands, but without Split. Other agreements concerned the sovereignty of the port of Valona, the province of Antalya in Turkey and part of the German colonies in Africa. Germany and Austria-Hungary had only advanced the possibility of negotiating parts of the Trentino and Eastern Friuli, without Gorizia and Trieste. The offer of the French colony of Tunisia was deemed unsatisfactory. In April 1915 Italy joined the Entente and on 3 May 1915 officially rejected the Triple Alliance. In the following days Giolitti and the neutralist majority of the Parliament fought to keep Italy out of the conflict, while the nationalists demonstrated in the squares in favour of entrance into the war (the nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio defined them le radiose giornate di Maggio - \\"the sunny days of May\\"). On 13 May Salandra presented his resignation to King Victor Emmanuel III. Giolitti, fearful of a further blow to governing institutions, declined to succeed as prime minister and also resigned. Italy thenceforth entered the war under the impetus of a relative minority of its population and politicians. Postcard sent from an Italian soldier to his family, c. 1917.  Interwar period  In 1922, Benito Mussolini brought the fascist party to power in Italy with his March on Rome on 28 October. Mussolini repeatedly stated his dream of the Mediterranean Sea becoming an \\"Italian lake\\" (Mare Nostrum, \\"our sea\\") and valued war, saying \\"Though words are beautiful things, rifles, machine guns, planes, and cannon are still more beautiful\\".Smith, Italy: A Modern History, 447. = Corfu incident (1923) = In the Corfu incident Italy forced Greece to pay reparations and apologize for the murder of an Italian general by bombarding and temporarily occupying the Greek island of Corfu. This incident was indicative of the aggressive posture of the new Fascist regime. =Conquest of Ethiopia (1935‚Äì1936)= The Second Italo-Ethiopian War was to be Mussolini's way of making up for Italy's embarrassing defeat at the hands of the Ethiopians in the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1896, and was also a chance to expand the Italian empire by taking one of the last regions of Africa not controlled by other European powers and divert the populace from economic woes. General Emilio de Bono put on record that preparations for the invasion of Ethiopia (Abyssinia) had been going on since 1932 as roads were being built from Italian Somaliland into Ethiopian territory, though Mussolini constantly claimed that he was not a \\"collector of deserts\\" and would never think of invading. Ethiopians protested this build-up to war which eventually led up to a border clash at Walwal. Mussolini called this clash \\"unprovoked aggression\\" by Ethiopia and Italian forces invaded on 3 October 1935, led by de Bono. In only three days the Italians had captured Adwa by committing the world's first mass aerial bombardment of civilians. In December Pietro Badoglio replaced de Bono as commander of the invasion because of de Bono's cautious advance. In violation of the Geneva convention, the Italian military committed war crimes by extensively using chemical warfare against the Ethiopian military and, even more so, against Ethiopian civilians as well as attacking Ethiopian, British, and Swedish Red Cross facilities. On 31 March 1936, a desperate final counter- attack by Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, was carried out, though word of the attack had already gotten to the Italians, giving them victory in the Battle of Maychew again through the use of chemical weapons. Only a few days later the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa was conquered, allowing Italy to annex the country on 7 May, proclaiming Victor Emmanuel III Emperor of Ethiopia. Italy's East African possessions was unified into the colony of Italian East Africa. =Intervention in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)= On 17 July 1936, Francisco Franco and the rest of Nationalist Spain's forces began a rebellion against Republican Spain that was to last three years, called the Spanish Civil War. Franco was fairly sure that he would be able to secure German and Italian help for his National Faction, sending emissaries out on 20 July to achieve this. Both did indeed pledge support, sending in the Corpo Truppe Volontarie from Italy and the Legi√≥n C√≥ndor from Nazi Germany, as well as weapons and aircraft. Mussolini was very devoted, eventually sending in 37,000 men and huge numbers of planes to ensure that this \\"campaign against communism\\" would succeed. The foreign press started to heap pressure on Mussolini when Italian troops suffered a major defeat at Guadalajara, which led to Mussolini sending in normal troops rather than militia to fight in Spain, eventually ruining the Italian economy with the expense of a war Mussolini thought would end any day. This war also distracted Italy, allowing Germany to carry out the annexation of Austria with the Anschluss, a move that otherwise may have been a breaking point between the two powers, due to Austria's alliance with Fascist Italy. The war was supposed to be a staging ground for Italian tactics, potential time to fix any creases out of the system, but Italy continued during World War II to use the same tactics as long before that, unlike Germany's new revolutionary war tactics. =Conquest of Albania (1939)= As Germany was occupying Czechoslovakia, Mussolini decided to accompany that invasion with his own invasion of Albania. Albania had long been politically dominated by Italy and several of its military officers were actually Italian.Smith, Italy: A Modern History, 466. Albanian King Zog was in fairly serious debt and wanted help from Italy, so Mussolini sent foreign minister Gian Galeazzo Ciano to him with a list of demands, which Ciano described as impossible to accept. Once King Zog declined, Mussolini said that he must accept the demands by 7 April 1939, or Italy would invade. The invaders had already disembarked to invade before that time. General Alfredo Guzzoni led two Bersaglieri divisions with a battalion of tanks in the invasion, where resistance was minor, though various organizational problems in the Italian military showed themselves. King Zog fled the country to Greece, was granted asylum in Athens and eventually got to London. On 12 April, the Albanian parliament voted to unite their country with Italy, giving Victor Emmanuel III the Albanian crown. =Pact of Steel= On May 22, 1939, the Pact of Steel was signed by Galeazzo Ciano and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, effectively allying the two powers. Despite the fairly good relations the two states had had, many Italians were against this alliance, thinking of it as more of a submission to Germany, knowing that Italian interests were likely not to be favored in the relationship. The alliance also technically forced Italy to join in any war that Germany had entered, so that Germany could at any time present the treaty and force Mussolini to enter, though they did not end up using this right.  World War II  Nazi Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, but Italy remained neutral for the following ten months even though it was one of the Axis powers. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's Under-Secretary for War Production, Carlo Favagrossa, had estimated that Italy could not possibly be prepared for such a war until at least October 1942. This had been made clear during Italo-German negotiations for the Pact of Steel whereby it was stipulated that neither signatory was to make war without the other earlier than 1943.Walker (2003), p.19 Although considered a major power, the Italian industrial sector was relatively weak compared to other European major powers. Italian industry did not equal more than 15% of that of France or of Britain in militarily critical areas such as automobile production: the number of automobiles in Italy before the war ranged at c. 372,000, in comparison to c. 2,500,000 in Britain and France. The lack of a stronger automotive industry made it difficult for Italy to mechanize its military. Italy still had a predominantly agricultural-based economy, with demographics more akin to a developing country (high illiteracy, poverty, rapid population growth and a high proportion of adolescents) and a proportion of GNP derived from industry less than that of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Sweden, in addition to the other great powers.Steinberg (1990), pp.189,191 In terms of strategic materials, in 1940, Italy produced 4.4, 0.01, 1.2 and 2.1 Mt of coal, crude oil, iron ore and steel, respectively. By comparison, Great Britain produced 224.3, 11.9, 17.7, and 13.0 Mt and Germany produced 364.8, 8.0, 29.5 and 21.5 Mt of coal, crude oil, iron ore and steel, respectively.Walker (2003) p.12 Most of the raw material needs could only be fulfilled through importation and no effort was made to stockpile key materials before the entry into war. Also, approximately one quarter of Italy's merchant fleet were present at foreign ports and given no forewarning of Mussolini's rash decision to enter the war and were immediately impounded.Bauer (2000), p.231Walker (2003), p.26 Another handicap was the large number of weapons and supplies given by Italy practically for free to the Spanish forces fighting under Franco during the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939.Beevor (2006) pp.45, 47, 88‚Äì89, 148, 152, 167, 222‚Äì24, 247, 322‚Äì26, 360, 405‚Äì06, 415Walker (2003), p.17 The Italians also sent the \\"Corps of Volunteer Troops\\" (Corpo Truppe Volontarie) to fight for Franco. The financial cost of this war was between 6 and 8.5 billion lire, approximately 14 to 20% of annual expenditure. Added to these issues was Italy's extreme debt position. When Benito Mussolini took office in 1921 the government debt was 93 billion lire, un-repayable in the short to medium term. Yet only two years later this debt increased to 405 billion lire.Bonner and Wiggin (2006), p84 The Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) therefore remained comparatively depleted and weak at the commencement of the war. The Italian tanks were of poor quality, and radios were few in number. The bulk of the Italian artillery dated from World War I. The Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica's) primary fighter was the Fiat CR-42, though an advanced design for a biplane with excellent performance characteristics,Eden & Moeng (Eds.) (2002), pp.680‚Äì681 it was obsolete compared to the then current generation monoplane fighters of other nations. The Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) had no aircraft carriers. In addition, the Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) could field approximately 1,760 aircraft, of which only 900 could be considered as \\"front-line machines\\".Bierman & Smith (2002), pp.13‚Äì14 Yet whilst equipment was lacking and outdated, Italian authorities were acutely aware of the need to maintain a modern army and were taking the necessary steps to modernize in accordance with their very own relatively advanced tactical principles.Walker (2003) p.30‚Äì53Sadkovich (1991) pp.287‚Äì291 Almost 40% of the 1939 budget was allocated to military spending.Steinberg (1990), pp.189 Awareness existed, albeit belatedly, of the need to have close air support for the Navy and the decision to build carriers was taken. And whilst the majority of equipment was obsolescent and poor, appropriate steps were being taken whereby quality equipment was being developed. For example, the three series 5 fighters were capable of meeting the best allied fighters on equal terms,Eden & Moeng (Eds.) (2002), pp.684-685,930,1061 but only a few hundred of each were produced. The Fiat G55 Centauro received much German interest and was defined by Oberst Petersen, advisor to Goering, as the \\"best Axis fighter.\\"Arena 1994, p. 23. The Carro Armato P40 tank,Bishop (1998) p.18 roughly equivalent to the M4 Sherman and Panzer IV, was designed in 1940, but no prototype was produced until 1942 and developers/manufacturers not able to roll out any of these tanks before Armistice. This was owing, in part, to the lack of sufficiently powerful engines, which were themselves undergoing a development push. Unlike the Allies, Italian tank designers did not think to use old aircraft engines, which were available in relative abundance, and would have certainly facilitated more rapid tank development. Total tank production for the war (‚âà3,500) was less than the number of tanks used by Germany in its invasion of France. The Italians were also reported to be the first to use self-propelled guns,Walker (2003) p.109 both in close support and anti-tank roles, and their, for example, 75/46 (& 75/32), 90/53 (a peer of the German 88/55), 102/35 and 47/32 mm, and 20 mm AA guns were not obsolete.Bishop (1998) pp.149,164 Also of note were the AB 41 and the Camionetta AS 42 which were regarded as excellent vehicles of their type. None of these developments precluded the fact that the bulk of the equipment was obsolescent and poor. However, it was this relatively weak economy, lack of suitable raw materials and inability to produce suitable quantities of armaments and supplies which was predominant reason for Italian military failure. On paper, Italy had one of the largest armies,Mussolini, Peter Neville, pg 140, Routledge, 2004 but this was far from reality. According to the estimates of Bierman and Smith, the Italian regular army could field only about 200,000 troops at the start of World War II. Irrespective of the attempts to modernize, the majority of Italian army personnel were lightly armed infantry lacking sufficient motor transport. There was insufficient budget to train the men in the services such that in World War II the bulk of the personnel received much of their training at the front, when it was too late to be of use.Walker (2003) p.23 Air units had not been trained to operate with the naval fleet and the majority of ships had been built for fleet actions, not the convoy protection duties which they were mostly employed for during the war.Walker (2003) p.21 Regardless, a critical lack of fuel kept naval activities to a minimum.Bauer (2000), p.96, 493 Senior leadership was also an issue. Mussolini personally assumed control of all three individual military service ministries with the intention of influencing detailed planning.Walker (2003) p.11 Comando Supremo (the Italian High Command) consisted of only a small complement of staff that could do little more than inform the individual service commands of Mussolini's intentions, after which it was up to the individual service commands to develop these into proper plans and execute.Walker (2003) p.20 The result was that there was no central direction for operations and the three military services tended to work independently, focusing only on their fields, with little inter-service cooperation.Bauer (2000), pp.90‚Äì95 The Army itself was essentially split into two different institutions; those institutionally loyal to the king (Regio Esercito) and those to Mussolini, and discrepancies in pay existed for personnel of equal rank, but from different units. Following the German conquest of Poland, Mussolini would change his mind repeatedly as to whether he would enter the war. The British commander in Africa, General Archibald Wavell, correctly predicted that Mussolini's pride would ultimately cause him to enter the war. Wavell would compare Mussolini's situation to that of someone at the top of a diving board: \\"I think he must do something. If he cannot make a graceful dive, he will at least have to jump in somehow; he can hardly put on his dressing-gown and walk down the stairs again.\\"Quoted in Axelrod, Alan 2008, The Real History of World War II, p. 180, Sterling Publishing Co. Some historians believe that Italian leader Benito Mussolini was induced to enter the war against the Allies by secret negotiations with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, with whom he had an active mail correspondence between September 1939 and June 1940.Garibaldi (2001), p.142 The journalist Luciano Garibaldi wrote that \\"in those letters (which disappeared at Lake Como in 1945) Churchill may have extorted Mussolini to enter the war to mitigate Hitler's demands and dissuade him from continuing hostilities against Great Britain as France was inexorably moving toward defeat. In light of this, Mussolini could urge Hitler turn against the USSR, the common enemy of both Churchill and Mussolini\\". Initially, the entry into the war was clearly political opportunism, which led to a lack of consistency in planning, with principal objectives and enemies being changed with little regard for the consequences.Walker (2003) p.25 Mussolini was well aware of the military and material deficiencies but thought the war would be over soon and did not expect to do much fighting. This led to confusion amongst ordinary Italians and soldiers who had little idea of what they were fighting for and, hence, had little conviction and saw little justification for it. As the war progressed and one disaster followed another, Comando Supremo were forced to take more serious steps in their planning. = France = As the war looked increasingly bad for the allies, with the impending German conquest of Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, Mussolini could no longer hold himself back and declared war on the allies on 10 June 1940. To Mussolini it seemed that the war was already nearly over, and he wanted to make sure that Italy at least got a position at the peace tables at the end and obtained such lands as Corsica, Nice, and more North African territory. The Italian offensive against France did not actually begin until ten days after the declaration of war, and Italian troops (fighting against a numerically inferior French force, which was however well-entrenched in the Alpine Line) were very slow to capture territory, while Germany had already taken hold of Paris. By 25 June, the armistice with France had already been arranged, though Italian troops made only insignificant progress into French territory, advancing of few kilometers and suffering exceedingly heavy casualties. = Africa = Mussolini's entry into the war was at least bad news for the United Kingdom, as the Regia Marina would now oppose them in Mediterranean waters. Italian armies in Libya and East Africa could also potentially have knocked British troops completely out of Egypt, having half a million men in Africa compared to the United Kingdom's fifty thousand.Hart, History of the Second World War, 109. However, British troops took the initiative in Africa while Italy was still having trouble pacifying Ethiopia and General Wavell kept up a constantly moving front of raids on Italian positions that proved to be successful. On 14 June a successful surprise attack was made on Fort Capuzzo by the British, though it was not meant as a permanent gain as the British were using far more mobile tactics at the time. By mid-September, casualty listings indicate that Italy had lost 3,000 troops where the United Kingdom had only lost slightly over 490, despite Italy's land numbers and air superiority at the time. On 13 September 1940, Italy began a very slow advance eastward into Egypt. The Italians advanced with six divisions. After three days, they stopped and set up a chain of fortified camps near Sidi Barrani. However, the chain of camps were too far apart from one another. This allowed Wavell make a crippling blow to the Italian forces around Sidi Barrani right at the start of what was to become Operation Compass. Richard O'Connor led the initial attack against the Italian camps. O'Connor moved between the camps and around to the Italian rear. This greatly surprised the Italians and the British were able to immediately capture four thousand prisoners. This attack alone could have effectively annihilated the Italian army in North Africa. But the British commanders did not foresee such a large victory. Instead, the initial attack was thought of as a large-scale raid. For this reason, no infantry division was available to press home the British opportunity at Sidi Barrani. So the remaining Italian troops managed to escape safely to Bardia. However, Bardia was captured by the British within three weeks. The Italian campaign in East Africa was initially more successful, as the Italians captured British Somaliland and small parts of Sudan and Kenya, but lack of fuel and resources then forced them to abandon any further intent of advance and take up a defensive posture against an expected counterattack. This counterattack came from two Indian divisions from Sudan, three divisions from Kenya and an amphibious attack from Aden, in co-operation with Ethiopian Arbegnoch rebels. The Allied forces captured Somalia in February, Eritrea in March‚ÄìApril (after the decisive Battle of Keren), and Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, in April.Smith, Italy: A Modern History, 476. The Duke of Aosta, viceroy of Italian East Africa, surrendered at Amba Alagi in May. Forces in Italian East Africa were somewhat cut short by the Regia Aeronautica's forced presence in the Battle of Britain at the time, leaving only 150 planes in Ethiopia, as well by the impossibility of receiving supplies from Italy. Some Italian garrisons, such as Gondar and Culqualber, held out till November 1941, and a small number of Italians waged a guerrilla war for some more time, some continuing till 1943. Campaigning in North Africa then fell to Erwin Rommel over any Italian generals, as many Panzer units came into the theatre from Germany as the Afrika Korps. However, the bulk of the Axis army in North Africa was still Italian. Rommel was at first very successful, reaching the Egyptian border again in less than a fortnight as he caught Wavell off-guard. Another British offensive was crushed, and Rommel made his way to El Alamein. This made Mussolini believe the end was near, as he flew to Africa, planning to enter the capital of Egypt triumphantly, only to wait three weeks, then fly back to Rome. Field Marshal Montgomery won at El Alamein in October 1942 for the British. This victory coincided with Operation Torch, America's landing in French North Africa, and the Battle of Stalingrad's outcome, destroying Axis morale. After the final loss of Libya in January 1943, Italian and German forces fought the Tunisian Campaign and finally surrendered on 13 May 1943. = Greece = With very little preparation after this disaster in Africa and the ensuing retirement of Rodolfo Graziani, Mussolini then decided on an invasion of Greece as his next move to keep in pace with Germany's recent occupation of Romania. After large propaganda campaigns and even the sinking of a Greek light cruiser, Mussolini then handed an ultimatum to Ioannis Metaxas, Prime Minister of Greece, which would initiate the Greco-Italian War. Hitler was against Mussolini's invasion (as it would require German troops' help later on), but Mussolini continued without German knowledge, as he felt that the Nazis had invaded countries too many times without telling Mussolini beforehand. Mussolini was very unsure of what date to invade, as he changed his mind many times, even five times in one segment of fifteen minutes.Smith, Italy: A Modern History, 477. Eventually he decided on 28 October, the anniversary of the March on Rome, though staff headquarters was not aware until they heard the date on London radio. In about two weeks, the Italian army was already retreating back into Albania, for conditions at this time of year were very detrimental to mountain warfare and general organization problems continued throughout the military. Franco of the recently victorious Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War was pondering entrance into World War II, but Italy's failure in Greece put him off of the idea. Hitler then came in to rescue Mussolini's troops, gaining him the upper hand in all politics and military operations for the rest of the war. = Soviet Union = Mussolini was actually in the middle of negotiating a commercial treaty with the Soviet Union when Hitler invaded his former ally in fighting Poland 22 June 1941. However, Mussolini was taken once again by Hitler's promise of quick victory and would eventually send a total of 200,000 troops to the Eastern front, initially organized as the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia. To begin with, three divisions were sent, though only one division was at all motorized, but that division had no tanks. After some large initial losses in the \\"Celere\\" Division, Mussolini sent four new infantry divisions and three Alpini (alpine) divisions to the Soviet Union to officially make his forces an army in July 1942 (Italian Army in Russia). But instead of being deployed in the Caucasus Mountains as expected, the Italian units were tasked with holding the front in the Don river plains. As a result of this disastrous strategic decision, the Alpine troops armed, trained and equipped for mountain warfare and the under strength Italian infantry divisions were pitted against tanks and mechanized infantry, to counter which they were neither equipped nor trained. The Soviet offensive Operation Little Saturn wiped out the majority of the Italian troops, with only the 2nd \\"Tridentina\\" Alpine division escaping annihilation. By the end of February 1943, the few remaining Italian troops were being withdrawn, a huge blow to public opinion of the Fascist government in Italy. The remnants of the Italian Army in Russia was still in Italy at the time of the Italian Armistice in September 1943 that led to it being officially disbanded. = Sicily and armistice = On 10 July 1943, a combined force of American and British Commonwealth troops invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German generals again took the lead in the defence and, although they lost the island, they succeeded in ferrying large numbers of German and Italian forces safely off Sicily to the Italian mainland. With the loss of Sicily, popular support for the war diminished in Italy. On 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism ousted Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and a new Italian government, led by General Pietro Badoglio and King Victor Emmanuel III, took over in Italy. Although the new government declared that Italy would go on fighting with the Axis, it immediately began secret negotiations with the Allies to end the fighting and to come over to the Allied side. On 3 September, a secret armistice was signed with the Allies at Fairfield Camp in Sicily. The armistice was announced to the public on 8 September. By then, the Allies were on the Italian mainland (landing unopposed because of the armistice). The Germans were aware that the Italy might defect from the Axis and strengthened their forces in Italy in preparation during the time of Italy's secret negotiations with the Allies. In the event, the Italian armed forces were given unclear instructions on how to treat their former German allies. Resistance was therefore slight as the Germans moved in and disarmed the Italians and took control of the northern part of Italy. (The exception to this was the navy that received orders to steam out of reach of the Germans. Therefore, few Italian ships fell into German hands.) The captured Italian soldiers were given the choice of imprisonment or to keep fighting for Germany. A minority choose to fight with the Germans. In the Balkans, that Italy had previously occupied alongside Germany, thousands of Italian soldiers evaded capture and joined the local resistance movements. To circumvent the ban on using prisoners of war as forced labor, the Germans re-designated their Italian prisoners as \\"military internees\\" and shipped them to Germany as slave labor. The Germans freed Mussolini in the Gran Sasso raid (12 September 1943) and set him up as the leader of the Italian Social Republic (RSI) puppet state that kept fighting the Allies until it collapsed when the German forces in Italy surrendered in the spring of 1945. The Allies were of two minds on how to treat the Kingdom of Italy after the armistice. The US wanted to treat the Kingdom of Italy as an equal member of the Allies, while the British wanted to treat the Kingdom like a defeated enemy. The armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy did therefore not enter the war against Germany in full force, although \\"Co-Belligerent\\" forces (the Italian Co-Belligerent Army, the Italian Co- Belligerent Air Force and the Italian Co-Belligerent Navy) were eventually set up and fought with the Allies. The post-armistice period also saw the rise of a large Italian resistance movement that fought the Germans and the RSI in the north. = Aftermath of World War II = Defeat in World War II led to the loss of the entire Italian Colonial Empire (including colonies that had not been conquered by the Fascist government (such as Libya)) among other territorial losses as stipulated in the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947.

Post-war Italy adopted a republican constitution and became one of the founding members of the Western Bloc military alliance NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) that was formed 4 April 1949 and remains a member as of 2019. = Multinational Force in Lebanon (1982‚Äì1984) = In 1982 Italian forces were deployed to Lebanon (then racked by the Lebanese Civil War) together with American and French troops as the Multinational Force in Lebanon. The stated aim of the Multinational Force was to oversee the withdrawal of the PLO from Lebanon but the deployment lasted beyond that point. The Italian contingent of around 3,000 troops was led by then Brigadier General Angioni, that in the end was the most successful of the three deployed forces, raising the confidence of Italian leadership and people in the Armed Forces, recovering the low esteem in the public opinion caused by the defeat in World War II and paving the way to the subsequent increase in overseas missions for the Italian military. The Multinational Force was withdrawn following the deadly 1983 Beirut barracks bombing that simultaneously struck the French and American forces. The Italian contingent was not targeted in this attack. The Italian force was withdrawn on 20 February 1984 (the US followed on 26 February and the last French troops left on 31 March). Two Italian military personnel died while serving in the Multinational Force in Lebanon. = Gulf War (1990‚Äì1991) = Italy contributed 4 warships (plus one support ship) and Panavia Tornado IDS Interdictor/Strike aircraft to the Coalition of the Gulf War. = NATO intervention in the Bosnian War (1992‚Äì1995) = Under the auspices of NATO, Italy participated in interventions in the Bosnian War (1992‚Äì1995). Italy took active part in Operation Deny Flight enforcing a no-fly zone over the war zone. Italian warships also took part in Operation Sharp Guard, a naval blockade enforcing an arms embargo and economic sanctions on the area of the former Yugoslavia. Italy was also part of the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina against Bosnian Serb targets. = Unified Task Force and United Nations Operation in Somalia II (1992‚Äì1995) = Italian forces were part of the Unified Task Force and its successor United Nations Operation in Somalia II a United Nations peacekeeping force whose intervention in the Somali Civil War ultimately proved unsuccessful, ending in withdrawal in 1995. = Operation Alba (1997) = Operation Alba was an Italian-led multinational peacekeeping force sent to Albania in 1997. Its stated intention was to help the Albanian government restore law and order in the troubled country after the 1997 rebellion in Albania.Operation Alba on the UN website, accessed 2012 November The Italian 3rd Army Corps assumed responsibility for the 'Alba' Mission, the first multinational Italian-led mission. Fifteen contributing nations brought humanitarian aid to crisis-struck Albania.NATO, NRDC-IT Emblem, accessed November 2011 = Kosovo War (1999) = Italy took part in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì1999). The Italian Air Force operated with 34 Tornado, 12 F-104, 12 AMX, 2 B-707 and the Italian Navy operated with Harrier II. The Italian Navy also contributed a naval task force that included the aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi, a frigate (Maestrale) and a submarine (Sauro class), that operated with other NATO ships in the Adriatic sea. Italian troops are part of the Kosovo Force, a NATO-led peacekeeping force that deployed to Kosovo after the end of the war in 1999. = War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) = Alpini from the 4th Alpini Regiment in Afghanistan As part of Operation Enduring Freedom, launched by the United States in response to the September 11 attacks, Italy contributed to the international operation in Afghanistan. Italian forces are part of the ISAF, the NATO-led force in Afghanistan, and has had a Provincial reconstruction team in the country. Italy initially sent 411 troops, based on one infantry company from the 2nd Alpini Regiment tasked to protect the ISAF HQ, one engineer company, one NBC platoon, one logistic unit, as well as liaison and staff elements integrated into the operation chain of command. Italian forces also command a multinational engineer task force and have deployed a platoon of Italian military police. Three AB 212 helicopters were also deployed to Kabul and four Panavia Tornado aircraft. 47 Italian military personnel have died while serving with ISAF. = Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq (2003‚Äì2006) = The Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq consisted of the nations whose governments had military personnel stationed in Iraq. The Italian Army did not take part in initial combat operations of the 2003 Iraq War, dispatching troops after May 1, 2003 ‚Äì when major combat operations were declared over by the U.S. President George W. Bush. Subsequently Italian troops arrived in the late summer of 2003, and began patrolling Nasiriyah and the surrounding area. On 26 May 2006, Italian foreign minister Massimo D'Alema announced that the Italian forces would be reduced to 1,600 by June. The last Italian troops were withdrawn from Iraq in September 2006. 33 Italian military personnel died while serving in Iraq. The greatest single loss of life was on November 12, 2003 when a suicide car bombing struck the Italian Carabinieri Corps HQ in Nasiriyah and killed a dozen Carabinieri, five Army soldiers, two Italian civilians, and eight Iraqi civilians. = Multi-National Force ‚Äì Lebanon (2006‚Äìpresent) = Italian UN soldiers in Lebanon Operation Leonte ‚Äì Under the UN mission UNIFIL, Italy sent naval units and 3,000 troops to control the southern Lebanon border. = 2011 military intervention in Libya = Italy was part of the initial coalition (later expanded to nineteen states) of states that intervened in the Libyan Civil War. =Deployments to Niger= In December 2017, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni announced that 470 Italian soldiers would be deployed to Niger in an effort to mitigate the European migrant crisis.

In 2003, AIDA32 3.61 is out provided with a hardware database with 25,000 entries, monitor diagnostics and is localized to 23 languages. The latest version 3.94 was released in March 2004. AIDA32 was distributed as freeware, and as a portable executable file which does not need to be installed on the host computer. Development of AIDA32 was stopped on March 24, 2004. = Everest = In April 2004, Mikl√≥s was appointed Executive Vice President of Software Engineering Research & Development at Lavalys. The successor of AIDA32 was the commercial Lavalys product 'Everest. Lavalys distributed a freeware version of Everest up until version 2.20, which is still available via freeware distribution websites. The freeware Everest Home Edition was discontinued on December 1, 2005 in favour of a full commercial and paid version. The final and last version of Everest is 5.50, released in April 2010.

Throughout the 20th century, Tjaru has been identified as Tel Abu-Seifa, 4km east of Qantarah. After excavations in the late 20th and early 21st century, the current consensus is that Tell Heboua, near Qantarah, is the most likely site of the fortress.Ian Shaw, The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press 2000, , p.212 Tell Heboua is upon a kurkar ridge, giving it the strategic advantage of high ground. Excavations by the Supreme Council of Antiquities at Tell Heboua began in 1988. Archaeologists first proposed that Tell Heboua, not Tel Abu-Seifa, was the Pharaonic-era fortress of Tjaru around 2000. In July 2007, the confirmation of the ancient fortress at Tell Heboua as Tjaru was announced, with graves of soldiers and horses, mud-brick walls, and a moat. Further discoveries were announced in 2008, including reliefs depicting Pharaohs Thutmose II, Seti I and Ramesses II.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/06/080602-egypt-fort.html In January 2015, new discoveries at the site were announced that confirmed its identification as the fort of Tjaru.http://thecairopost.youm7.com/news/132836/travel-antiquities/ancient- egyptian-fortress-unearthed-in-sinai See also *Walls-of-the-Ruler References *Moran, William L.

(Retrieved 18 October 2010). He was influenced in the study of history and archaeology by Michael Holroyd, his Brasenose tutor; R. G. Collingwood, the renowned authority on Roman Britain; and F.G. Simpson, Director of Field Studies at Durham, and a great influence on Birley vis-√†-vis the art and science of excavation.Draper, Simon. \\"From Aesica to Asia: A Short History of Archaeology at Durham University,\\" Durham University. (Retrieved 18 October 2010.) Under the direction of F.G. Simpson, Birley began excavating at Hadrian's Wall in 1927 while an undergraduate. Birley's first archaeological dig occurred at Birdoswald. After graduating from Oxford, Birley worked for a short time for the Society of Antiquaries of London acting as a construction site observer for the Society. It was during this period in London that Birley befriended Mortimer Wheeler of the London Museum engendering in Birley a lifelong interest in \\"imported Roman 'samian' pottery with moulded decoration.\\" A chance discovery in 1929 of two inscription stones in the praetentura\\"'forward extent' This was the front part of the camp, between the via principalis and the porta praetoria, and bisected by the via praetoria. This area was generally filled with the tents or barrack-blocks of the garrison, the first cohort of a legion being always housed here. In the camp described by Hyginus, this area also contained the valetudinarium and veterinarium, the tribunes' houses, the scholae of the officers, and the fabrica; most of these building being transferred to the latera praetorii in the auxiliary forts.\\" from \\"The Roman Army in Britain: Roman Military Glossary , Roman-Britain.org (Retrieved 2010-10-18) at Birdoswald led Birley to suggest redating the Wall periods. This discovery, and Birley's redating, impacted the study of Roman Britain tremendously inasmuch as it \\"has formed the basis of all subsequent work on the chronology of Hadrian's Wall.\\" In 1929, having developed a keen interest in the Wall through his excavations, Birley succeeded in buying the Clayton Estate at Chesterholm that had belonged to Anthony Hedley, the 19th century antiquary. Nearby Houselands would also come up for sale; however, Birley could not afford the purchase of both properties, although he would eventually excavate them both. Chesterholm-Vindolanda would eventually be converted into a museum and research centre, in which the spectacular finds from Vindolanda would be displayed and interpreted. leftIn 1931, at the age of 24, he became a lecturer at the University of Durham, \\"already with an impressive record of excavation on Hadrian's Wall, partly under the guidance of F.G. Simpson,\\" whom he would replace upon the latter's stepping down as Director of Field Studies. Through trips to Germany and Switzerland, he began to expand his expertise in samian pottery, epigraphy, and his primary field of interest, the Roman army. As a consequence of these trips abroad, his continental reputation grew. In 1943, he was promoted to reader. In 1947, he became Vice Master of Hatfield College. In 1949, he was promoted to Master of Hatfield. He would finish his academic career having been Master of Hatfield College (1949‚Äì1956); Professor of Romano-British History and Archaeology (1956‚Äì1971); Head of the Department of Archaeology (1956‚Äì1971); and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences (1968‚Äì1971). In 1949, Birley established the first International Congress of Roman Frontier Studies. During his tenure, he was president of all three of the local archaeological societies. Also, during his years at Durham, he would influence such notable students as George Jobey and John Gillam, each of whom would go on to hold prestigious university teaching positions. One student recalls that Birley was \\"incredibly generous and trusting in ‚Ä¶ [his] ‚Ä¶ support to students.\\" Birley would become known as an expert on the Roman army. For his \\"practical experience of the ways in which modern armies work,\\" he was inspired in asking questions about organisation and methods of the Roman army.Eric Birley: ‚ÄúIntroduction,‚Äù The Roman Army: Papers 1929‚Äì1986.

Birley's influence is still very much alive in the Archaeology Department at Durham University: \\"Durham Archaeology is still founded on the vision and determination of its early pioneers, notably Eric Birley and ‚Ä¶ [his] ‚Ä¶ influence lives on in successive generations of staff and students.\\" In Birley's obituary, former Durham PhD student and Emeritus Yates Professor of Greek and Roman Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, John Wilkes wrote in The Independent that \\"Eric Birley dominated the study of the Roman army, of Hadrian's Wall and Roman frontiers in general for much of his 40 years as a teacher at Durham University, interrupted only by six years of war service, when he was engaged in the study of the German army for Military Intelligence.\\"  World War II service  During World War II, he worked in military intelligence. Birley was appointed to the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers Special List (a list of officers not formally attached to a unit) as a second lieutenant on 25 August 1939, just prior to the outbreak of war. In the New Years Honours of 1943 Birley, by then promoted to the rank of captain and temporary major, became a member of the military division of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). On 24 May 1945 Birley, since promoted to temporary lieutenant-colonel, received permission from the war office to accept the award of the Polish order of Polonia Restituta fourth class (officer's cross). On 16 January 1948 he received permission to accept the American award of the Legion of Merit third class (officer). On 8 September 1953 Birley, whose permanent commission during the war had only been that of a lieutenant and who held the war substantive rank of major, was granted the permanent rank of major backdated to 1 January 1949. Major Birley reached the age limit (50 years) for service on 12 January 1956 and retired from the army on that date, being granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel.  Personal life  In 1934, he married Margaret Isabel Goodlet, a former student of his, a marriage that would last over 60 years until his death. Their two sons, Robin (1935‚Äì2018) and Anthony (1937‚Äì ), would both become eminent in their field, and would continue their father's work at Vindolanda. The elder, Robin, was named after Birley's great influence, R.G. Collingwood, while the younger, Anthony, was named after Anthony Hedley, the former owner of Chesterholm. While still excavating at Chesterholm-Vindolanda to this day, the Birley family no longer reside there having left Chesterholm for Durham in 1950.  Birley family  Eric was the great-great-nephew of Hugh Hornby Birley, who led the troops at the Peterloo Massacre.Entry on Birley family genealogy Selected publications  *  See also  *Official Vindolanda Site *Robin Birley (son) *Anthony Birley (son) *Andrew Birley (grandson) *Brian Dobson *David Breeze References Category:British archaeologists Category:English archaeologists Category:Academics of Durham University Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:People educated at Clifton College Category:People from Eccles, Greater Manchester Category:1906 births Category:1995 deaths Category:British people of English descent Category:Scholars of Hadrian's Wall Category:Scholars of Roman history Category:20th-century British historians Eric Birley Category:Masters of Hatfield College, Durham Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the British Academy Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Category:20th-century archaeologists ","title":"Eric Birley"},{"id":"6704538","text":"Ribblehead excavation 9th century (North Yorkshire) The domestic kitchen found during the excavation Ribblehead is the area of moorland at the head of the River Ribble in the area known as Ribblesdale, in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, England.

ICCEC establishment: 1992-1994  1992: On June 26, Randolph Adler is consecrated a bishop by Bishop Timothy Barker of the International Free Catholic Communion. The Charismatic Episcopal Church of North America (CEC) is formed with four congregations, including St. Michael's Pro- Cathedral. Bishop Adler is designated Primate. 1993: Dale Howard, an Episcopal priest, is consecrated bishop for Jacksonville, Florida. The consecration is performed by Bishop William Millsaps of the Episcopal Missionary Church. Bishop Millsaps, who has Anglican apostolic succession, also re-consecrates Bishops Adler and Sly, in order to strengthen the validity of the CEC's apostolic succession. 1994: The CEC holds its first national convocation in Kansas City in April, attended by 300 people. Loren Thomas Hines is ordained to the priesthood and soon consecrated bishop in Manila, the Philippines. Hines was founder and leader Christian Life Fellowship International. The CLFI churches become parishes of the CEC, and Hines' CLF congregation in Manila is renamed Cathedral of the King. Hines becomes head of the Diocese of Southeast Asia. Malcolm Smith is ordained to the priesthood, and consecrated bishop soon afterwards in San Antonio, Texas. Smith is a renowned teacher with a large following in charismatic churches, with his message of God's grace and \\"covenant love.\\" Many Smith followers around the country start making inquiry into the CEC after hearing of his consecration. The International Development Agency is established to support foreign missions and aid churches in developing countries. It is headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, with Thomas Abbott as its first director. St. Michael's School for Ministry is established to provide academic preparation for candidates for holy orders. Classes begin to be held in San Clemente and twelve satellite locations.  Rapid growth: 1995-2001  1995: Clergy are ordained or received in Uganda and Estonia. Fr. Craig Bates and his entire congregation in Malvern (Long Island), New York, leave the Episcopal Church and reorganize as Church of the Intercessor. With over 900 members, Intercessor becomes the largest CEC congregation in the U.S. The CEC's first sister (nun) is professed at the Life in Jesus Community in Libertytown, Maryland, headed by former Episcopal priest Philip Zampino, now a CEC bishop and abbot. 1996: The ICCEC holds its first international convocation in Jacksonville, Florida, with 1,000 people in attendance. ICCEC bishops begin seeking a line of apostolic succession that will be recognized as valid by the Roman Catholic Church. In the summer, two bishops make contact with the Igreja Catolica Apostolica Brasileira (ICAB), the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church. ICAB's line of apostolic succession comes through its founder, former Roman Catholic bishop Carlos Duarte Costa of Brazil, who left the Roman Catholic Church in 1945. Current ICAB patriarch Luiz Fernando Castillo Mendez begins talks with the ICCEC about passing on its apostolic succession. 1997: The CEC cathedral in Manila, the Philippines, is confiscated by a powerful business group. The cathedral sits on prime real estate and is wanted for a new business development. The government accedes to the business group's demands, but parishioners occupy the cathedral building and barricade themselves inside for several days. Eventually parishioners are evicted from the building, and a new property is later obtained. The International College of Archbishops (later called the Patriarch's Council) holds its first meeting in Normandy, France. On Nov. 5 at Libertytown, Maryland, Bishops Adler, Sly, Lipka, Zampino, and Fick are re-consecreated by Bishop Luiz Fernando Castillo Mendez and two other bishops of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (ICAB). ICAB leadership instructs the ICCEC to use the Roman Catholic forms for all future ordinations and consecrations. The ICCEC and ICAB enter into intercommunion. On Nov. 19, several more bishops are re-consecrated with the Duarte Costa line of apostolic succession, in New York City. Bishops are instructed to conduct new ordination services for all existing priests and deacons, passing on the Duarte Costa line. Congregations are established in Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Great Britain. The first African bishops are consecrated in Kenya. Benson Odinga Otieno and Bernard Njoroge Kariuki, former Anglican priests, become bishops for the 70 Kenyan congregations that are entering the ICCEC. The CEC in Kenya is called the Episcopal Church of Africa. 1998: The House of Bishops reaffirms the name \\"Charismatic Episcopal Church\\" for the communion. They assert their belief that this name was given by divine inspiration and should be retained. The Society of St. Dismas, an international prison ministry, is founded by Fr. Frank Constantino of Florida. 1999: The CEC receives parishes in Pakistan, and a bishop is consecrated for that country. 2000: At the International Convocation in San Clemente, all 29 bishops of the ICCEC are assembled for the first time. CEC For Life is created as a pro-life ministry headed by Fr. Terry Gensemer. 2001: The Gathering of Champions (later named Laudate) youth movement begins in Selma, Alabama. Organized by Fr. Marc Vincent, the first Gathering of Champions brings together 100 youth from all over the U.S. for several days of worship and fellowship. The next year over 500 youth attend, again in Selma.  Consolidation: 2002-present  2002: Bishop Adler's stepdaughter and two grandchildren are killed in an automobile accident. This tragic incident initiates a period of grief throughout the entire ICCEC. Fr. Paulo Garcia of Recife, Brazil, brings his entire parish and five other churches into the CEC. Fr. Garcia is dean of Holy Trinity Church, which had been the largest Anglican parish in Latin America. Bishop Njoroge of Kenya is appointed to the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission, and becomes an outspoken advocate of democracy and greater freedom in Kenya. He still serves on the Commission as of 2006. The ICCEC publishes 2002 data on the number of clergy and congregations around the world. * Kenya: 140 clergy, 320 congregations * Uganda: 200 clergy, 264 congregations * U.S.A.: 400 clergy, 136 parishes * Philippines: 4 bishops, many other clergy, 40 congregations * 24 Filipino congregations in Europe * Pakistan: 21 parishes * Brazil: 6 parishes * Canada: 8 clergy, 4 congregations * Burundi, Congo, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania - several congregations each. * Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, Switzerland ‚Äì at least one congregation each 2004: ICCEC holds its third international convocation in Manila, The Philippines. 2005: Management responsibility for the International Development Agency is transferred to the Office of the Patriarch in San Clemente. 2006: Several congregations and bishops in the United States leave the ICCEC over concerns about leadership and direction. The Patriarch's Council addressed these concerns in September 2006. 2007: October 15, 2007, Patriarch Adler retired from the Office of the Patriarch; Archbishop Hines, Primate of Asia, assumed the office being the senior member of the Patriarch's Council. 2008: On January 9, The College of Archbishops and the Patriarch's Council has elected Bishop Craig W. Bates as the new Patriarch of the ICCEC. On July 30, during the ICCEC's 4th International Convocation, Archbishop Bates was enthroned as the second patriarch and primate of the ICCEC in North America. The celebration was presided over by the Most Reverend Loren Thomas Hines, Archbishop of Manila and the ICCEC's primate in the Philippines and Asia. 2012: On July 10‚Äì12, the 5th International Convocation of the Charismatic Episcopal Church was held in Madrid, Spain.

An exploratory shaft was drilled in the 1950s but was not worked, and the shafts and adit were partly or totally sealed in 1972 and 1989. After its closure, the mine became the largest bat hibernaculum in New Jersey, with as many 30,000 bats each winter. In 2010, less than 10% that number was found in the mine following an outbreak of white nose syndrome. History The Hibernia mines are upon one vein, extending at least in length. Where it cropped out of the south side of the hill at Hibernia it was operated by Samuel Ford, Stirling and those who preceded them, and adjoining to the northeast the \\"Ford mine\\" was operated, as we have seen, by Jacob Ford and his lessees and grantees. But those operations were small compared with the mining of the last thirty years. Taking them in order, the mine to the southwest is the Beach mine, owned by the New Jersey Iron Mining Company, formerly by Conrad Poppenhusen, who purchased of Dr. C. Beach. It was first opened about the close of the war, and is now being operated by the Andover Iron Company. Next to this is the \\"Theo. Wood mine,\\" the oldest opening of them all, and covering the vein on the side and foot of the Hibernia hill. It formerly belonged to the two sons of Benjamin Beach, Chilion and Samuel Searing Beach. The share of Chilion was bought by his son Columbus, and Thomas Willis, of Powerville, purchased the other half. Dr. Beach and Willis sold the mine, January 11, 1853, to Theodore Wood for $14,000, which was supposed to be an excellent sale; but in 1865 it was sold to Conrad Poppenhusen for five times that amount. It belongs now to the New Jersey Iron Mining Company, which leases it to the Andover Iron Company. With the other mines owned or leased by the latter company it is under the management of Richard George. Next in order is the Old Ford mine, now owned by the Glendon Iron Company. This company, being the lessee of the mines beyond, has not driven its Ford mine so rapidly as those leased by the company, holding it in reserve. Next to this mine are the Crane mine, belonging to the estate of Mrs. Eliza A. Crane, one of the daughters of Colonel William Scott, and the De Camp mine, belonging to the heirs of Mrs. Augusta DeCamp, wife of Edward DeCamp and another one of the daughters of Colonel Scott. Both of these mines and the Upper Wood mine are and have been for many years leased and operated by the Glendon Iron Company, whose general superintendent and manager is George Richards, of Dover. The Upper Wood mine, so called from having once been owned by Theodore T. Wood, and to distinguish it from the one under the hill, formerly belonged to Elijah D. Scott, a son of Colonel William Scott. Beyond the Upper Wood mine is the Willis mine, which was once the property of Araminta Scott, another of the daughters of Colonel Scott. It is now operated by the Bethlehem Iron Company and belongs, as does also the Upper Wood mine, to the New Jersey Iron Mining Company. An underground railroad has been constructed from the foot of the hill northeast upon or in the vein through the bowels of the mountain, which brings the product of all the upper mines to the terminus of the Hibernia Mine Railroad, on which all the ore of the Hibernia mines goes to market. The tonnage of this road, almost entirely made up of the product of these mines, was 99,123 tons in 1879.'Munsell's History of Morris County, New Jersey (1882) p. 65. History of Morris County, New Jersey with Illustrations, and Biographical Sketches of Prominent Citizens and Pioneers, 1739-1882; New York: W.W. Munsell & CO., 1882. CHARCOAL FURNACES-- POMPTON, HIBERNIA, MT. HOPE AND SPLIT ROCK. THE first furnace within the present limits of Morris county was probably the one built at Bloomingdale, about a mile above Pompton, by the Ogdens. Benjamin ROOME, for many years a deputy surveyor of the board of proprietors, and who has been engaged all his life in surveying and searching titles in Morris and Passaic, ascribes its erection to them. He states that he saw the stack still looking fair seventy years ago. It was close to the high bank, about one-eighth of a mile below where Stony Brook empties into the Pequannock. The Midland Railroad now passes just in front of its site. It has not been in blast since 1800, and must have been built many years before. It is now gone. The Ogdens were from Newark, and were the pioneers in furnace building in this section, as well as in the manufacture of iron generally. April 15th 1740 Cornelius BOARD sold to Josiah OGDEN, John OGDEN jr., David OGDEN sen., David OGDEN jr. and Uzal OGDEN, all of Newark and called the \\"Ringwood Company,\\" sixteen acres of land at Ringwood, where they built the furnace afterward purchased of them in 1764 by Peter HANSCLEVER for the London Company. The Ringwood Company was thus the predecessor of the London Company. Josiah OGDEN and David OGDEN were brothers, and David had sons John, David and Uzal. Josiah had a son named David and one named Jacob. It is quite probable that the David OGDEN jr. was the son of Josiah OGDEN, and the same afterward known as the Old Judge, and whose sons-- Samuel, Abraham and Isaac--were men of mark in their day, Samuel being in partnership with or succeeding his father in Old Boonton. November 27th 1766 John OGDEN and Uzal OGDEN of Newark mortgaged to Thomas PENNINGTON and Ferdinand PENNINGTON, of Bristol, England, several tracts in the counties of Bergen and Morris, and among the rest a tract at Bloomingdale partly in Morris and partly in Bergen, conveyed to them in two lots--one, containing 137.64 acres, by Philip SCHUYLER and wife, August 1st1759; the other, containing 34 acres, by Guilliam BATOLF, October 1765. It is altogether probable that on this tract the furnace stood and that the deeds to the Ogdens indicate when it was built. After the sale in 1764 to the London Company by the Ogdens we meet frequently with their names in the history of the iron business of Morris county. Samuel OGDEN resided at Boonton. April 17th 1776 Joseph HOFF speaks of a moulder whom he desired to obtain having been applied to by Messrs. OGDEN, of Pompton furnace, to work at that business. It seems from this that the OGDENs after locating at Old Boonton still had their furnace at Pompton. HIBERNIA FURNACE. If the Bloomingdale furnace was not built before 1765 then the first one in the county was the Hibernia furnace --styled in its beginning \\"The Adventure.\\" A very interesting sketch of this enterprise during the Revolutionary war has been written for the May 1880 meeting of the New Jersey Historical Society by Rev. Joseph F. TUTTLE, D. D., and published in the 6th volume of the society's proceedings. Much of the material used in making up this sketch is taken from that article. Hibernia is situated about four miles north of Rockaway and is now connected with it by a railroad. Horsepond Brook, coming from between high hills on the west, here falls into a little valley almost surrounded by other hills. On the northeast side of this valley and from the side of one of these hills the celebrated vein of iron ore outcropped. Here John JOHNSTON obtained his ore for his \\"iron works\\" at Beach Glen, without troubling himself as to ownership. May 17th 1753 Joshua BALL located the level ground on which is built the village of Hibernia, his tract covering both sides of the brook and a strip sixteen chains long up the face of the northerly hill, containing the outcrop, with a view, no doubt, of including the vein of ore for that distance. July 1st 1761 Colonel Jacob FORD located a lot of 1.87 acres on the vein next northeast of the Ball survey. It is described as \\"lying upon Horse Pond Mountain, which is on the east side of Horse Pound Brook;\\" and the metes and bounds begin ninety-four links from the northwest corner of Ball's survey, \\"upon a mine called Horse Pound mine.\\" The land about this tract was afterward located by Samuel FORD, and disputes frequently arose as to its boundaries, by reason of the uncertainty of its description and the variations of the magnetic needle, by which the lines were run and which was entirely untrustworthy in the presence of such large bodies of magnetic iron ore. The mine on this lot is still called the \\"Ford mine.\\" April 6th 1765 and June 25th 1765 five tracts were returned to Samuel FORD, four containing ten acres each and one containing 10.34 acres, which were \\"about one mile and a half above John JOHNSTON's iron works.\\" They were upon the vein of ore and upon the stream above the Ball survey. They were located evidently for the purpose of building the furnace, and the work was immediately begun; for November 23d 1765, in describing a tract of land returned to Henry TUTTLE, farther up the stream, it was said to be \\"about three fourths of a mile from the new furnace called the Adventure.\\" Though the lands were returned to FORD alone, yet this was probably for greater convenience only, as October 28th 1765 FORD and his wife Grace, by two deeds of that date, conveyed one third of the several lots so located to James ANDERSON and another third to Benjamin COOPER, retaining the other third. Of James ANDERSON very little can be gathered except the recital in the deed to him that he was from Sussex county. The other two partners became notorious for their crimes, which brought one under sentence of the gallows, and made the other a fugitive for his life. Samuel FORD was a nephew of Colonel Jacob FORD sen., and COOPER was a son of Daniel COOPER, one of the judges of the county. Both were found to be engaged in counterfeiting; and FORD is supposed to have been concerned in the robbery of the treasury at Amboy, in 1768. Ford was the master spirit; and Cooper, when convicted and sentenced to be hung, at the September term of the Morris court, in the year 1773, charged his misfortune to his partner. The history of this crime and the fate of its perpetrators is related in another part of this book. September 17th 1765 a lot of 20.39 acres adjoining the BALL survey was returned to Thomas STITES, and by him conveyed to Lord STIRLING; and the next year and in 1768 and 1769 several other tracts in the neighborhood of Hibernia were returned to Lord STIRLING. Three of them located in 1766 are said to be for the purpose of conveying them to James ANDERSON and Benjamin COOPER. There is no record of the transaction; but it would seem from these locations, and from the fact that in 1771 a suit was brought against STIRLING, Benjamin COOPER and Samuel FORD, that ANDERSON had sold his interest to STIRLING about this time. From a letter written by COOPER while in Morristown jail under sentence of death it also appears that FORD had that year conveyed his interest to STIRLING, and that he (COOPER) had done the same. The letter was written in his dire extremity with a view to interest STIRLING in his welfare, and pretending that he could be of great assistance to him if his life was spared, and could show him wherein FORD was overreaching him in the sales. Taking all these circumstances into account it is probable that in 1771 STIRLING became the sole owner of Hibernia. William ALEXANDER, or Lord STIRLING, as he is generally called, was a man of high character and standing, and very prominent in the councils of the State. His biography, written by his grandson, Hon. William A. DUER, has been published by the New Jersey Historical Society; but a brief account of his life may properly be inserted here. He was born in 1726, in the city of New York, the son of James ALEXANDER, a fugitive from Scotland on account of his adherence to the house of Stuart. On the breaking out of the French war in 1755 young ALEXANDER became the aide-de-camp of General SHIRLEY, and he served in that capacity during the greater part of the war. In 1737 the earldom of Stirling became vacant, and on the death of his father, who made no claim to it although entitled to do so, William ALEXANDER preferred his claim, and in 1757 went to England to press his suit in person. In America his right to the title was never questioned. In 1761 he returned to America, and shortly after built the mansion at Basking Ridge in which he afterward resided. He was chosen a member of the Provincial Council and held that office till the Revolution. He was also surveyor-general of the State. On the breaking out of the war he was commissioned as colonel of a regiment of Somerset militia by the Provincial Congress of New Jersey; but before the regiment could be gotten ready he was appointed by Congress to take command of two regiments in the continental service. March 1st 1776 he was commissioned by Congress to be a brigadier-general and was stationed at New York. At the battle of Long Island he was captured, with a force of about four hundred Marylanders, part of his command, with which he had attacked a superior force under CORNWALLIS in order to enable the main body of his men to escape. On the 19th of February 1777 he was promoted by Congress to be a major-general, and as such served with distinction until his death, which occurred at Albany, January 15th 1783, in consequence of fatigue of body and mind, to which his arduous military service had exposed him. From the building of the Adventure furnace in 1765 until 1775 the business of making iron was carried on; but to what extent we have no record. After 1775 we have some account of its operations in the letters of Joseph and Charles HOFF, who were Lord STIRLING's managers at Hibernia, and whose letters to their principal have been preserved. In that year Joseph HOFF, a brother-in-law of Benjamin COOPER, came from Hunterdon county to take charge of the works. He was assisted at first, and at his death, in 1777, succeeded by his brother Charles HOFF jr., who was in turn assisted by a younger brother John. Charles HOFF continued to be manager at Hibernia until 1781, when he removed to Mount Pleasant, at which place he continued to reside until his death, which occurred in 1811. Extracts from his letters will best give the history of matters during the busy scenes of the war. The works of the London Company had been burned, and the furnace at Hibernia and that recently erected at Mount Hope became important to both the army and people. On May 17th 1775 Joseph HOFF writes to Robert ERSKINE, the manager for the London Company at Charlotteburgh, Long Pond and Ringwood, and in his letter says: \\"I lately received a letter from Messrs. MURRAY, N. Y., informing me that all the powder in that place had been secured for the safety of the province in case matters were to come to such desperate lengths as that they must have recourse to blows with the parent State. Alarmed at this piece of news I went immediately to New York to know what was to be done with the works, they being lately put in blast, a large stock of wood cut and great number of hands employed at the coaling and other business, and not more than five weeks ore now raised. They answered me that, although the most diligent search has been made for powder, not a single pound was to be had; but that a little before this general stoppage took place 3/4 cwt. had been sent for us to Elizabethtown, which they hoped would serve us as a temporary relief till more could be had. I went immediately to Elizabethtown, where I found the committee of that place had seized on all the powder we had there and would not suffer it to be removed in this exigency.\\" The letter further states that in case the powder is not to be had he will be obliged to adopt a measure \\"disagreeable to both of us,\\" and prevent ERSKINE \\"from taking oar from the upper part of the mine called Lord STIRLING vein,\\" which he was doing under permit of Colonel OGDEN. Colonel Samuel OGDEN, who is the one referred to, claimed an interest in the Ford mine. But this threat did not produce the desired effect. ERSKINE visited OGDEN at once at Old Boonton and OGDEN maintained his right to the ore. Under date of May 25th 1775 HOFF writes to STIRLING: \\"The furnace goes well, as do all the other branches of business. We have made 70 tonns iron already, but not more than four or five tonns gone down. I wrote you we received two casks of powder from E. Town.\\" Again he writes, \\"The furnace goes extremely well--we shall make at least twenty tons weekly.\\" April 17th 1776 HOFF writes to Messrs. MURRAY that \\"Lord STIRLING told me he would find us work at casting cannon that would weigh from 25 to 30 cwt., which are 9 or 12 pounders; these we can do, but not heavier.\\" He further inquires as to quantity and price, and says, \\"It will do to engage at 45 or 43¬£ proc. [proclamation money] per ton provided we have the making the balls for the cannon, and they should alway go together.\\" In May the manager drops the subject of cannon to write: \\"Our people are so distressed for rum that I believe I must have one hogshead, let the price be what it will. They must pay accordingly. I hope you will not forget about the powder.\\" June 9th 1776 he writes: \\"All the miners have been quite idle for want of powder. The furnace will soon get ahead of us, using the ore so fast, when it will be impossible for the miners to keep her going.\\" Under the same date he writes that himself and FAESCH are anxious to receive the moulds for the cannon, etc., which had not yet arrived. August 3d Mr. HOFF writes: \\"Last night we made a trial at casting one of the guns, but unfortunately for us we brought the furnace too low and it missed in the breech. All the rest was sound and good. We have had to make a good many preparations; our clay was bad. However, we are not discouraged, but willing to try again, being convinced that the iron will answer. I have now to inform you that we shall set about it with all the vigor imaginable. We shall not, however, cast any more till we have all things in readiness. We propose to have twelve or fourteen of the moulds ready by the last of next week, after which the moulder assures me he will make three or four a day till the whole are finished. But as a most enormous expense attends the business it will not be in our power to make the small guns under 7d. York money per pound. If the general consents thereto you will please by the return of the post to inform.\\" Under date of August 31st 1776 Mr. HOFF writes to Colonel MOYLAN: \\"A certain Mr. Thomas IVES apply'd to me to make a number--say 36 or 38 three- pounder cannon for the gundolers. We had two ready for trial some two days past. I wrote twice to Mr. IVES to come up for that end, but not hearing from him I yesterday charged the cannon with two full cartridges made up for the three- pounder and two balls, and have the pleasure to inform you it stood and is undoubtedly good. I made no agreement with Mr. IVES as to the price, and as a most enormous expense attends the business I do not choose to go on till I hear from you. I have consulted with Mr. FAESCH and Messrs. OGDEN, ironmasters, and we are clear that we cannot make cannon at less than ¬£50 proc. per ton and powder to prove them. If you consent to allow me that price I will immediately engage a set of moulders and drive on the business with spirit. We can make, I believe, from three to nine and perhaps twelve-pounders. I would be much obliged for your answer by the return of the Morristown post.\\" Colonel Stephen MOYLAN, to whom this letter was addressed, was an Irishman, a brave patriot in the Revolutionary army, at Cambridge aide de camp of WASHINGTON, made commissary general in March 1776, but soon resigned for want of exact business habits, and re-entered the line as a volunteer. He saw much service and was brevetted brigadier general. He died in Philadelphia, April 11th 1811. Under date of November 14th 1776 Mr. HOFF writes to Colonel KNOX (chief of artillery under WASHINGTON): \\"I wrote you a few days past that in consequence of your letter of 10th ult. we had got everything in readiness and had cast several tons of the shot, but that it was altogether out of my power to get them carted. We have now upwards of 35 tons made, and as the furnace is doing no other business shall, I hope [be able] to complete the order. Every preparation of moulds, flasks &c.; for the grape shot is now finished, and we shall soon have a good assortment of each kind.\\" The next letter is from Charles HOFF, is dated July 27th 1777 and is directed to Governor LIVINGSTON, begging him to give Colonel John MUNSON--who had charge of the militia for that part of the county and was about to levy a draft for the army--such orders as would exempt his workmen. He speaks of a former exemption given by General WASHINGTON, and says, \\"We made the last year for public service upwards of one hundred and twenty tons of shot of different kinds.\\" October 7th 1777 an act was passed in the Legislature exempting 25 men from draft at Hibernia. March 4th 1778, Charles HOFF writes to Lord STIRLING: \\"The pig metal I have sold, some for ¬£12, some for ¬£15, some for ¬£20 and some for ¬£30 per ton. The stipulated price according to the act is ¬£20; please inform me how I must act in that case. The forges in this part of the country many of 'em are turned from the blooming to refining, and pig metal of course in great demand. There is also a great demand for hollow ware of all kinds, also salt pans, forge plates &c.;\\" March 20th 1778 HOFF wrote to Lord STIRLING in regard to going into blast, thinking it better to put it off, owing to the scarcity of men, coal, &c.--;\\"Don't your lordship think, as the blast is not likely to continue so long as usual, to put off blooming till the pasture become good, so that the teams can get their living in the woods, without being at the expense of feeding them?\\" He also says, \\"If ye lordship could send us some of the regular and Hessian deserters that don't choose [to enlist] into the continental service and depend on working in the country, to amount to 30 or 40, I would do my endeavor to make 'em serviceable.\\" The next letter in regard to the employment of deserters and Hessians gives the reason why quite a large number of Hessians were sent to Morris county. There are descendants of these \\"hated foreign mercenaries\\" still living in the vicinity of the iron works to which their ancestors were brought to work a hundred years ago. \\"William WINDS, Esq., Briadier-General. \\"Being in possession of a furnace as manager thereof, commonly called and known by the name of the Hibernia Furnace, belonging to the Right. Hon. William Earl of STIRLING, Major-General in the service of the United States of America, situate in the county of Morris and State of New Jersey, which is employed for the continent in casting all sorts of military stores, which we have engaged to furnish with as speedily as possible, I find it therefore essentialy necessary to employ a number of workmen for that purpose; and, as I am informed that a good many deserters both of the British troops and Hessians are come in and sent to Philadelphia, I have sent the bearer --my brother John HOFF--on purpose and given him full power hereby to engage as many men as he thinks proper, such as are used to cut wood in the winter season and can assist in the coaling business during the summer season, and a few other tradesmen; where they shall meet with the best encouragement and treatment, provided they make good several enagagements to which they will be called. And whatever agreements and promises the said John HOFF does make the same shall be punctually fulfilled by me the subscriber,\\"CHARLES HOFF Jun.\\"Hibernia Iron Works, July 4th 1778.\\" In the written instructions which were sent with Bernard SMITH, who represented Mr. FAESCH, and with John HOFF it is said that they wanted for Hibernia from fifteen to twenty-five men used to wood-cutting, coaling and labor suitable for iron works, a good blacksmith, a good wheelwright, one or two good carpenters and one or two good masons, as many as possible to be Englishmen or those who could speak that tongue. July 10th 1778 Mr. HOFF writes to Lord STIRLING that \\"Mr. TAYLOR of Durham furnace, in Pennsylvania, wrote Mr. FAESCH and me he had a complete set of moulds for hollow ware to dispose of reasonable. Mr. FAESCH recommended it much to me to buy 'em, in partnership with him, for the works. We have done so and brought them from Pennsylvania; the price was ¬£200, and at this time we are sensible they would not be made under ¬£600; there is from a 2-ounce grapeshot to a 32-lb. shot, moulds from 1 gall. pots to 40 or 50 gallons, 4 different stove moulds and moulds of every other kind.\\" In the same letter he complains that he cannot get supplied with flour and horse feed within 40 or 50 miles, and thinks, considering the public benefit of his work, that the quartermaster-general might supply him. The letters of the HOFFs end here, but it is well known that the furnace continued in operation throughout the war and manufactured war material for the army. The most notable event which happened in this period was the robbery of the HOFFs in the spring of 1781. A gang of robbers entered the house while the family were at supper and stole silver, jewelry, linen and clothing. They took horses also and got away safely with their plunder; but one at least, James BABCOCK, was afterward taken and hung. The county was infested with gangs of tories and lawless men, and others besides the HOFFs suffered from their visits. Robert OGDEN, of Sparta, in Sussex county, was robbed in a similar way. It is supposed the same gang who robbed the HOFFs attempted to rob Colonel John SEWARD, but failed. It is said that the colonel fortified himself in a block- house, and that on one cold night at about midnight a man rode up to his door and hailed, desiring to see the colonel, who instead of opening the door caught up his rifle and opened a hole through which he could look out. He discovered a man mounted on a fine horse, without a saddle and with rope stirrups. He at once knew his man, and, placing his rifle without noise in the hole between the logs, fired. Instantly all was still. The horse being frightened left the door, but was found the next morning eating at the colonel's haystack, with a dead man fastened in his rope stirrups under his feet. The horse proved to be a stolen one. How many other rascals accompanied the one killed was not known; but the colonel was avoided by the gang ever after. The history of the works at Hibernia for the twenty years succeeding the Revolution is involved in obscurity. Lord STIRLING's affairs after his death were found to be so much involved that his property was publicly sold by the sheriff. In 1774 he had applied to the board of proprietors for the purchase of the large tract surrounding his works at Hibernia, extending as far as Copperas Mountain and Greenville and known as the Hibernia tract. The board had consented to the sale and directed a survey to be made. April 15th 1785 Mr. PARKER laid before the board a letter from Colonel Benjamin THOMPSON, which he received on the Monday previous, informing him that he had purchased the Hibernia iron works of Messrs. MURRAY, Sanson & Co.; that he had been informed that the purchase money of 3,000 acres agreed for with Lord STIRLING had never been paid, and that he was willing to purchase the same agreeably to the original contract. September 13th 1787 a report was made to the board that the surveys for THOMPSON were not yet completed; but April 10th 1788 there was a report of a survey made by Lemuel COBB of 4,365.43 acres, subject to deductions, to be conveyed to Benjamin THOMPSON and his associates at ¬£20 per 100 acres. April 14th 1791 an agreement was made by Mr. Rutherford, president of the board, and Mr. PARKER to sell to John MURRAY and John STOTESBURY lands surveyed by Lemuel COBB, to accommodate Hibernia iron works with coal and wood, at ¬£20 per 100 acres, with interest from May 1st 1788. The tract had been returned to John STEVENS, late president of the board, in trust to convey it to Murray & Stotesbury, and a deed had to be made from his heirs-at-law to Mr. RUTHERFORD, then the president of the board, to carry out the agreement. The return included 5,222.44 acres, but after deducting 866.86 acres of prior locations included therein there were left 4,355.58 acres. Prudden ALLING, sheriff of Morris county, on an execution on a judgment obtained at the April term of 1768, by Waddell CUNNINGHAM and others against Lord STIRLING, sold to Lemuel COBB, by deed dated February 16th 1791, the several tracts which made up the Hibernia tract for ¬£30. It was probably to complete the title about to be made to MURRAY or STOTESBURY. William JACKSON stated that ROSS & BIRD carried on the Hibernia furnace until STOTESBURY came into possessession of it; but who they were or how long they had possession it is impossible to ascertain. John STOTESBURY, who appears to have come into possession in 1791, was of Irish descent, and is described as a high liver, of very genial habits and popular in the community. He was an officer in the continental army and had a brother in the British army, on Lord HOWE's staff. He served at Trenton and Princeton, and was wounded at Brandywine. He owned a pew in the Rockaway church, where he attended with his family. He had two daughters, one of whom married Hon. Philemon DICKERSON, of Paterson. STOTESBURY introduced Irish employes at his works, supplanting the Germans, who went over to Mt. Hope, excepting those who found places in the mountains beyond. George SHAWGER, Charles WINTERS, William BARTON, Pater SANDERS and Jacob BOSTEDO were some of those who remained on their lands, and whose descendants continue to own and reside on them. Mr. BOSTEDO was a very good man, and was ordained by the Morris county presbytery to preach. STOTESBURY failed in 1798 and died shortly afterward. The title of the property was made to John MURRAY for the large tract surrounding the Hibernia property, by Walter RUTHERFORD, December 8th 1792, and the several lots on which the furnace stood by William SHUTE and his wife, May 9th 1796. After MURRAY's death, August 15th 1809, his executors made an agreement to convey the whole property to Dr. Charles M. GRAHAM, of New York. This gentleman was the owner of the \\"Copperas tract\\" near Green Pond, where Job ALLEN made copperas during the Revolutionary war, and he himself carried on the copperas manufacture very extensively during the war of 1812. He was of Scotch descent, a strong adherent of the Stuarts and a man of great enterprise. GRAHAM built up the furnace, and then assigned his agreement for a conveyance to Samuel THOMPSON, Peter THOMPSON and William SPENCER, who received the deed dated January 1st 1815 from MURRAY's executors. The men who thus took possession of the property were described by Hubbard S. STICKLE as young men, who undertook the business with spirit; but the times were against them and they soon failed. The furnace went down, and it has never been rebuilt. The mortgage given to GRAHAM was foreclosed and the property bought by Benjamin ROGERS in 1819. He sold off considerable of the land in lots, and May 18th 1821 conveyed the balance to Colonel William SCOTT, who built a forge upon the old furnace dam. A freshet swept the dam away and the forge was suffered to go to decay. On the death of Colonel SCOTT, in 1842, this property, with a large amount of other real estate which he had gathered together in the course of his busy life, was divided among his children. The Hibernia mines so divided, and which included all of the vein except the lower mine (which belonged to Benjamin BEACH) and the old Ford mine, have since developed immense wealth and are still among the chief mines in the county. MOUNT HOPE FURNACE. The third furnace built within the limits of Morris county was at Mount Hope, and it was running more or less continuously for a period of fifty years. When the large survey was made of what is called the Mount Hope tract in 1772, of 6,271.06 acres, there were some twenty-two prior locations within its limits. The tract began on the mountain between Rockaway and Dover, ran down to near the old Dr. KING place in Rockaway, thence almost parallel to the Morris Canal to near the westerly side of the Rockaway Presbyterian cemetery, thence to near White Meadow and from there, with many turns, to a point between Denmark and Middle forge; thence down to Mount Pleasant, and so across by the Baker & Richards mine to a point on Mount Hope avenue in the easterly suburbs of Dover, and so to the Rockaway River near the \\"point of the mountain,\\" and thence back on the Rockaway Mountain to the place of beginning. Nearly all the lots excepted were in the neighborhood of Rockaway and Dover, and at the Mount Hope mines. The earliest location near the present village of Mount Hope was the lot returned to Samuel GARDINER in 1749, at the same time and recorded on the same page as the OSBORN location of Middle forge. By GARDINER it was sold to Abner BEACH, and by him to Jacob FORD. It was on the northwest side of Rockaway River, and on a small brook which runs into the northwest corner of the \\"Hunting Meadow,\\" as the great meadow at Mount Hope was then called, and contained 26.26 acres. Probably after Jacob FORD had purchased this lot he proceeded to locate lands in its neighborhood, taking up in 1750, at the same time he took up the Burnt Meadow forge lot, 96.72 acres, \\"situate in the meadow well known as the Hunting Meadow,\\" and 26.23 acres adjoining the GARDINER lot. In 1754 he located ten acres more to the east of the GARDINER lot, in 1757 142 acres more, and shortly afterward 58.80 acres on the road leading from \\"David BEMAN's to what is called the Middle forge,\\" and 10.41 acres \\"on both sides of the road leading from David BEMAN's iron works to the Burnt Meadow forge.\\" Colonel FORD no doubt purchased the property for its mines‚Äîwhich were then well known and which he needed to supply his forges‚Äîand for the meadow, which yielded abundant hay for his teams. In 1768, February 28th, he conveyed the whole property, including the seven lots so purchased or located by him, to his son Jacob FORD jr., who took up his residence there. In 1772, however, John Jacob FAESCH, having severed his connection with the London Company, came to Mount Hope, and, taking a long lease of the lands owned by FORD, purchased from the proprietors the great Mount Hope tract surrounding them, already mentioned, and began the building of the furnace. He afterward purchased Middle forge and Rockaway forge, leased Mount Pleasant forge and the Boonton mills, and carried on the iron business on a large scale. John Jacob FAESCH, who thus became one of the most noted ironmasters of the county, was a man whose influence was long and widely felt. He was born in the canton of Basle, Switzerland, in the year 1729, and came to America in 1764, under an arrangement made with Francis Casper HASENCLEVER on behalf of his brother, Peter HASENCLEVER, the general manager and superintendent of the London Company, as the manager of their iron works. The agreement was for seven years, and HASENCLEVER stipulated to pay FAESCH's, his wife's and servants' passage and deliver them and their goods and effects safely in America, with the expenses of FAESCH from New Wood, where he lived, to Remsheid, where the agreement was made; to pay him 2,500 guilders per annum Rhenish, to begin on the first day of his journey; to give him a tenantable dwelling house, with meadow for pasturing two or four kine; that he might engage in other business, but not to the prejudice of the company's interests; and that he was not to be under command of any one except the members of the company, but should have direction over all the forges, mines and iron works that were erected or occupied or should thereafter be undertaken. In fact, it was a very liberal agreement and proves how valuable his services were thought to be. In accordance with this agreement FAESCH came to this county, and was first placed by HASENCLEVER at Ringwood, where he resided and acted as manager. In 1768 the works at Charlotteburgh were placed in his charge, and afterward the works at Long Pond. Trouble arose, however, between HASENCLEVER and the other members of the company. He was considered too extravagant, and in other respects a bad manager. At all events Robert ERSKINE was appointed to succeed him, and arrived in this country June 5th 1771. FAESCH resented the treatment of his friend HASENCLEVER, and left the service of the company in June 1772, his term of seven years having expired. He had already made arrangements to take the Mount Hope property. FAESCH is described as a very generous and largehearted man, but very aristocratic in his ideas. He gave liberally to the church, so much so that in a subscription made in 1781 a prominent man in the Rockaway congregation subscribed \\"as much as any in the parish except Esq. FAESCH.\\" It is said, however, that he supported religion only as a means of keeping the lower classes in subjection. He and one Jacob HERTEL were naturalized by a special act of the Legislature, in 1766. On the breaking out of the war he was an ardent Whig, taking an active part in the politics of his day. He was a member of the convention to ratify the federal constitution, held December 11th 1787, and for many years was one of the county judges. Mr. STICKLE described him as of medium stature, and said he had often seen him passing through Rockaway, his carriage driven by men in livery, with outriders also in livery. He always stopped at Bernard SMITH's, who was a countryman and friend of his. His first wife was Elizabeth BRINCKERHOFF, sister of George BRINCKERHOFF, who was the father of the late Mrs. Dr. FAIRCHILD, of Parsippany. Mrs. Elizabeth FAESCH died February 23d 1788 at Morristown, where FAESCH had resided since the war, in the powder magazine, which he changed into a house. The next month after his wife's death he moved to Old Boonton, where he lived till his death. His second wife was Mrs. Susan (KEARNEY) LAWRENCE, widow of a brother of Captain LAWRENCE, U. S. N. The lease for Mount Hope was made by Colonel Jacob FORD, \\"of Pequanack,\\" of the first part, and John Jacob FAESCH and Daniel WRISBERG, of the same place, of the second part; was dated February 23d 1773, was to continue forty-two years from the first day of April then last past (1772), and reserved an annual rent of ¬£400 at 8 shillings the ounce. The rent is indorsed as paid to January 11th 1777, the date of Colonel FORD's death. In after years FAESCH complained of the rent as burdensome and that the property was not as valuable as he had supposed. To this remonstrance Judge Gabriel FORD, son of Colonel Jacob FORD, made a written reply which fully sets forth the condition of the property when the lease was made. He says: \\"There was then a meadow of 100 tons of timothy a year and the pasturage of the same after it was mowed, 60 or 70 acres of upland, an orchard 400 best grafted trees, an elegant dwellinghouse, cost ¬£1,400, a fine pond of water, dams and troughs, complete, and a good grist- mill, rented for ¬£40 per year;\\" that \\"Mr. FAESCH was not ignorant of a constant confluence of water into it [the mine] while my father had it, inasmuch as a pump must be pretty constantly at work to leave the mines at liberty;\\" and while Mr. FAESCH complained of spending ¬£1,200 \\"in driving on a level to draw off the water,\\" near ¬£800 of it had been deducted from his annual rent; that if Mr. FAESCH \\"had been as well skilled in farming as in the management of iron works the disasters (as he terms the failure of the hay crop) would not have happened in so eminent a degree;\\" that \\"in order to accommodate him genteelly there was erected upon the premises an elegant dwelling-house, which cost upwards of ¬£1,400;\\" that \\"on the premises stood an exceedingly good hemp-mill and grist mill, which together might have cost ¬£800 --these, being useless to Mr. FAESCH, are demolished;\\" that \\"the prices of iron have been often double and sometimes considerably more and so stands at present.\\" The reply concludes with an offer to abate ¬£100 or ¬£125 from the annual rent. Who Daniel WRISBERG was or what became of him is not known. After 1773 there is no mention of him, and the deed for the large tract was made to FAESCH alone. There is a tradition that he died before the war and left ¬£100 to the Rockaway church provided he should be buried under the pulpit, which was done. There is no record, however, confirming the story. The furnace was built in 1772, under the eye of its experienced owner, and was in good working order when the Revolutionary war broke out. We have not a letter book giving the details of its operations, but from the frequent reference to Mr. FAESCH in HOFF's letters from Hibernia, as well as from other sources, it is certain that large quantities of cannon, shot and iron utensils were manufactured there and that more men were employed than at Hibernia. The tories made many attempts to rob the house of FAESCH at Mount Hope and to destroy his property; but after the battle of Trenton and the capture of the Hessians, it is said, he made an arrangement with General WASHINGTON to keep thirty of the prisoners until the close of the war. These he kept employed in chopping wood, etc., keeping trusty men about him who were furnished with 30 stand of arms by the government, which were always kept in perfect order. These secured him from molestation. In the \\"instructions\\" to Bernard SMITH on the part of FAESCH and to John HOFF on the part of his brother, already spoken of, when they were sent to engage these prisoners, 25 or 30 men were asked for Mount Hope, \\"such as are used to wood-cutting, coaling and labor suitable for iron works, two good carpenters, one wheelwright, two blacksmiths, two masons; if you can meet with a young man or boy that can shave, dress hair, wait on table, take care of horses, etc., get him, if possible an Englishman or one that talks both languages.\\" \\"If any or all of 'em has guns advise them to bring them along; they'll be allowed a generous price here for 'em, and also all accoutroments in the military way.\\" \\"It would also be advisable for you to inquire for Captain DEHAUK and the rest of the gentlemen that were prisoners at Mount Hope, as they'll be of infinite service to you.\\" \\"Mr. FAESCH wants a good beer-brewer and distiller, that is a genteel, sober, honest and industrious man--if possible an Englishman--as he has good conveniences for that business; he is willing if he can get a man he can confide in to take him into partnership.\\" October 7th 1777 an act was passed exempting fifty men at Mount Hope and twenty-five at Hibernia from military duty. In the preamble it is stated \\"that it is highly expedient that the army and navy should be furnished as speedily as possible with cannon, cannon shot, refined bar iron, shovels, axes and other implements of iron, which the furnaces at Mount Hope and Hibernia, with the forges at Brookland, Mount Pleasant, Longwood and Middle forge, so called from their local situation and other circumstances, are well adapted to supply; and whereas John Jacob FAESCH, Esq., the proprietor and conductor of Mount Hope iron works, and Charles HOFF jun., superintendent of the Hibernia furnace, by their memorial have set forth that the said works have been for some time past employed in providing the aforesaid articles for public use,\\" the act provides that FAESCH might enroll any number of men less than fifty to be employed in the iron works at Mount Hope, Brookland, Longwood, Mount Pleasant and Middle forge; and that HOFF might enroll twenty- five men to be employed at Hibernia furnace. These men were to be fully armed, equipped and disciplined by FAESCH and HOFF, but were not to be obliged to attend musters or to leave the works unless the county should be invaded. This act was repealed in 1779--probably after the Hessians had been introduced. After FAESCH removed to Morristown, and no longer personally superintended his furnace, etc., his business became less profitable and finally brought him in debt. William JACKSON stated as a fact of his personal knowledge--and we use his own language--that while FAESCH was still carrying on Mount Hope, and STOTESBURY Hibernia, Chilion FORD kept a store in Rockaway in the house south of the main street and near the Hibernia railroad, and on him orders were drawn by each company to its workmen, who came down each Saturday to draw their supplies for a week at a time. Every man appeared with his jug, and the first thing was a half gallon of rum to each man, and the balance of their orders in the necessaries of life. After their sacks were filled a general treating took place, after which they moved off over the bridge on their way home. When they crossed the race bridge and arrived at their parting point another big drink must be had all round, by which time \\"the critter\\" began to work, and then the national elements (Dutch and Irish, with a mixture of American by way of variety) brought on a general fight, which lasted a short time, when the hatchet was buried and all united in another drink and left-- each on his winding way, the women and boys bringing up the rear. July 28th 1788 Sheriff ARNOLD conveyed to Gabriel FORD, after a sale made under a judgment recovered by the executors of Jacob FORD sen. against the executors of Jacob FORD jr., deceased, the seven tracts of land \\"called and known by the name of Mount Hope, in the possession of John Jacob FAESCH, Esq., as tenant thereof,\\" and May 10th 1793 Judge FORD conveyed the whole to FAESCH, so ending the lease. FAESCH died May 29th 1799, and is buried at Morristown by the side of his wife and his two sons, John Jacob jr., who died in 1809, and Richard B., who died in 1820. The two sons and one daughter died single. Besides these Mr. FAESCH left one daughter, who married William H. ROBINSON of New York, and who died leaving two daughters, one of whom married Robert J. GIRARD. After FAESCH's death his two sons continued to carry on the business; but the creditors of their father became dissatisfied and filed a bill in chancery February 21st 1801 to compel a sale of the lands of FAESCH in satisfaction of their claims. A list of the property alleged to have belonged to him at his death includes the Mount Hope and Middle forge tracts (containing together 7,600 acres), the Rockaway forge, the Jackson or Jacobs mine, a mine at Long Pond, a share in the Morris Academy and several small lots. His Mount Hope lands included the Richards, Allen and Teabo mines, none of which except perhaps the Richards were then developed. The result of this suit was the appointment of General John DOUGHTY, of Morristown, a special commissioner to sell these lands. He was engaged for several years in dividing them up and disposing of them. The homestead at Mt. Hope, with 831 acres around it, including the mines, meadow and furnace, was sold September 25th 1809 for $7,655 to Moses PHILLIPS jr., of Orange county, New York. The land so conveyed is what is generally known now as the Mount Hope tract. Then or soon after Moses PHILLIPS became the owner of Hickory Hill tract, Middle forge tract, the Bartow tract, which lies south of Middle forge, and other lands, making up about 2,600 acres. He did not reside at Mount Hope himself, but sent his sons Henry W. PHILLIPS and Lewis PHILLIPS to manage the property‚Äîgiving them an agreement of purchase. In 1814 the property was leased to a company consisting of Robert McQUEEN, Abraham KINNEY and Eliphalet STURTEVANT and known as McQueen & Co. They repaired the old stack after it had lain idle for fifteen years, and did a thriving business, making pig iron and all kinds of hollow ware. KINNEY and STURTEVANT were not in the concern long and their place was taken by Colonel Thomas MUIR, a brother-in-law of Mr. McQUEEN. The first lease lasted seven years, and it was renewed for five. Alexander NORRIS, who then lived close by, fixes the date of the beginning of the lease by the fact that when peace was declared in 1815 they had a flag hoisted in the top of the furnace, which had not yet been started. Mr. NORRIS says the last blast was made in the fall of 1827, after which the furnace was permitted to lie idle, and finally to go down. While operating Mount Hope Colonel MUIR purchased the White Meadow tract and made it his residence. He continued to reside there until his death, which occurred September 28th 1855. November 29th 1831, by act of Legislature, the Mount Hope Mining Company was incorporated, the incorporators being Samuel RICHARDS, Moses PHILLIPS, Samuel G. WRIGHT and Thomas S. RICHARDS. The capital stock was fixed at $60,000. In April previous Moses PHILLIPS had conveyed to Samuel RICHARDS and Samuel G. WRIGHT a two- thirds interest in the tract of 831 acres, and two-thirds of all the minerals in the adjoining lands, owned by him at the time. After the incorporation of the company all three of the owners conveyed to the company, which has ever since been the owner. The stock has changed hands, but no transfers have been made by ordinary deeds of conveyance. By supplements to its charter the company was allowed to build a railroad to Rockaway (which was done), to construct furnaces, mills, etc., and to increase itscapital stock to $300,000. This is no longer a manufacturing property, but is one of the most extensive and productive mineral properties in the State. Edward R. BIDDLE became the owner of the stock several years after the formation of the company, and by him it was sold to Moses TAYLOR and his associates about the year 1855, for $80,000, which was considered a marvelous price at the time. SPLIT ROCK FURNACE. The only other charcoal furnace within the bounds of Morris county was built at Split Rock by the late Hon. Andrew B. COBB, of Parsippany, about 1862. Mr. COBB was a son of Colonel Lemuel COBB, the well known surveyor of the board of proprietors, and both by inheritance and purchase became the owner of large tracts of land in the northern part of the county, much of it covered with wood. He was also the owner of the Split Rock mine. To make his wood and ore available he built the furnace near his forge. It made but a few tons of iron, however, before it went out of blast, and has since been idle. It was found unprofitable in this day of anthracite furnaces.

(established in 1887 as Old Line Bankers Life Insurance Company of Nebraska) is a mutual insurance company. It is owned by Ameritas Mutual Holding Company, headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States. The company includes Ameritas Mutual Holding Company (AMHC) and Ameritas Holding Company (AHC), as well as Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. of New York. History Bankers Life Insurance building Lincoln, NE In 1984, Ameritas was mostly selling life insurance, with assets of less than $1 billion, and about 500,000 customers. In 1999, Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. merged with Acacia Mutual Holding Company. The latter had been formed in 1997 when Acacia Life Insurance Company of Washington, D.C., converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock company wholly owned by a mutual insurance holding company. The company formed by the merger of the Acacia and Ameritas holding companies was named the Ameritas Acacia Mutual Holding Company. In 2005, Ameritas merged with The Union Central Life Insurance Co. of Cincinnati, forming Unifi Mutual Holding Co. In 2006, The Ameritas Acacia Cos. merged with Union Central Life Insurance of Lincoln. In 2014, Union Central, still part of Ameritas, was being sued for allegedly overlooking an agent's ponzi scheme. Ameritas rebranded in 2012. It also merged at one point with Acacia Life Insurance Company. In 2013, it changed its name back from Summit Investment Advisors to Ameritas. Also in 2013, Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. sold Acacia Federal Saving Bank to Stifel Bank & Trust. In 2014, Ameritas Employees Credit Union and MembersOwn Credit Union both merged. In September 2014, Ameritas finished a new office building in Forest Park to house around 350 workers, also remodeling a nearby building to house 225 Ameritas employees. Nationally, Ameritas had 2,300 employees at that time. The company began a renovation of its Nebraska location in 2015. In 2015, the new public finance office of Ameritas Investment Corp. in Kansas City was largely staffed from Oppenheimer & Co. Oppenheimer stated they were \\"keenly disappointed\\" by what seemed an \\"orchestrated raid\\" on the staff of their Kansas City Public Finance business. In 2017, a judge ruled that Ameritas had no right to payment from a broker's bond after the broker was caught stealing from clients. Ameritas had sued Federal Life alleging breach of contract. Ameritas partnered with Nelnet on a student loan repayment program in 2017. In July 2019 and August 2019, a data breach at Ameritas was reported to possibly expose customer info. It has the sixth-largest property tax in Lincoln in 2019. Ameritas announced a public finance team, to be responsible for municipal bond financing, in September 2019. In January 2020, William W. Lester succeeded JoAnn M. Martin as CEO, after Martin became CEO in 2009. Martin became CEO of both Ameritas Mutual Holding Company and Ameritas Holding Company, and chair of Ameritas Life Insurance Corp on January 10. On January 1, 2010, Ameritas Acacia Mutual Holding Company merged with the Union Central Mutual Holding Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, and became the UNIFI Companies. Union Central Life was originally established as a mutual life insurance company in 1867, and it had formed its own mutual insurance holding company in 2005. UNIFI changed its name to Ameritas Mutual Holding Company. In 2014, Union Central Life and Acacia Life merged into Ameritas Life.

Intuitively, if each distribution is viewed as a unit amount of earth (soil) piled on M, the metric is the minimum \\"cost\\" of turning one pile into the other, which is assumed to be the amount of earth that needs to be moved times the mean distance it has to be moved. Because of this analogy, the metric is known in computer science as the earth mover's distance. The name \\"Wasserstein distance\\" was coined by R. L. Dobrushin in 1970, after the Russian mathematician Leonid Vaser≈°teƒ≠n who introduced the concept in 1969. Most English-language publications use the German spelling \\"Wasserstein\\" (attributed to the name \\"Vaser≈°teƒ≠n\\" being of German origin). Definition Let (M,d) be a metric space for which every probability measure on M is a Radon measure (a so-called Radon space). For p\\\\ge1, let P_p(M) denote the collection of all probability measures \\\\mu on M with finite p^{\\\\text{th}} moment. Then, there exists some x_0 in M such that: :\\\\int_M d(x, x_0)^{p} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (x) < \\\\infty. The p^\\\\text{th} Wasserstein distance between two probability measures \\\\mu and u in P_p(M) is defined as :W_p (\\\\mu, u):=\\\\left( \\\\inf_{\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma (\\\\mu, u)} \\\\int_{M \\\\times M} d(x, y)^p \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (x, y) \\\\right)^{1/p}, where \\\\Gamma(\\\\mu, u) denotes the collection of all measures on M \\\\times M with marginals \\\\mu and u on the first and second factors respectively. (The set \\\\Gamma(\\\\mu, u) is also called the set of all couplings of \\\\mu and u.) The above distance is usually denoted W_p(\\\\mu, u) (typically among authors who prefer the \\"Wasserstein\\" spelling) or \\\\ell_p(\\\\mu, u) (typically among authors who prefer the \\"Vaserstein\\" spelling). The remainder of this article will use the W_p notation. The Wasserstein metric may be equivalently defined by :W_{p} (\\\\mu, u) = \\\\left( \\\\inf \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\big[ d( X , Y )^p \\\\big] \\\\right)^{1/p}, where \\\\mathbf{E}[Z] denotes the expected value of a random variable Z and the infimum is taken over all joint distributions of the random variables X and Y with marginals \\\\mu and u respectively. Intuition and connection to optimal transport Two one-dimensional distributions \\\\mu and u, plotted on the x and y axes, and one possible joint distribution that defines a transport plan between them. The joint distribution/transport plan is not unique One way to understand the motivation of the above definition is to consider the optimal transport problem. That is, for a distribution of mass \\\\mu(x) on a space X, we wish to transport the mass in such a way that it is transformed into the distribution u(x) on the same space; transforming the 'pile of earth' \\\\mu to the pile u. This problem only makes sense if the pile to be created has the same mass as the pile to be moved; therefore without loss of generality assume that \\\\mu and u are probability distributions containing a total mass of 1. Assume also that there is given some cost function :c(x,y) \\\\mapsto [0,\\\\infty) that gives the cost of transporting a unit mass from the point x to the point y. A transport plan to move \\\\mu into u can be described by a function \\\\gamma(x,y) which gives the amount of mass to move from x to y. You can imagine the task as the need to move a pile of earth of shape \\\\mu to the hole in the ground of shape u such that at the end, both the pile of earth and the hole in the ground completely vanish. In order for this plan to be meaningful, it must satisfy the following properties : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\gamma(x,y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d} y = \\\\mu(x) & \\\\qquad \\\\text{(the amount of earth moved out of point } x \\\\text{ need to equal the amount that was there to begin with)}  \\\\int \\\\gamma(x,y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d} x = u(y) & \\\\qquad \\\\text{(the amount of earth moved into point } y \\\\text{ need to equal the depth of the hole that was there at the beginning)} \\\\end{align} That is, that the total mass moved out of an infinitesimal region around x must be equal to \\\\mu(x) \\\\mathrm{d}x and the total mass moved into a region around y must be u(y)\\\\mathrm{d}y. This is equivalent to the requirement that \\\\gamma be a joint probability distribution with marginals \\\\mu and u. Thus, the infinitesimal mass transported from x to y is \\\\gamma(x,y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} y, and the cost of moving is c(x,y) \\\\gamma(x,y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} y, following the definition of the cost function. Therefore, the total cost of a transport plan \\\\gamma is : \\\\iint c(x,y) \\\\gamma(x,y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} y = \\\\int c(x,y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma(x,y) The plan \\\\gamma is not unique; the optimal transport plan is the plan with the minimal cost out of all possible transport plans. As mentioned, the requirement for a plan to be valid is that it is a joint distribution with marginals \\\\mu and u; letting \\\\Gamma denote the set of all such measures as in the first section, the cost of the optimal plan is : C = \\\\inf_{\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma(\\\\mu, u)} \\\\int c(x,y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma(x,y) If the cost of a move is simply the distance between the two points, then the optimal cost is identical to the definition of the W_1 distance. Examples =Point masses (degenerate distributions)= Let \\\\mu_{1} = \\\\delta_{a_{1}} and \\\\mu_{2} = \\\\delta_{a_{2}} be two degenerate distributions (i.e. Dirac delta distributions) located at points a_{1} and a_{2} in \\\\mathbb{R}. There is only one possible coupling of these two measures, namely the point mass \\\\delta_{(a_{1}, a_{2})} located at (a_{1}, a_{2}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}. Thus, using the usual absolute value function as the distance function on \\\\mathbb{R}, for any p \\\\geq 1, the p-Wasserstein distance between \\\\mu_{1} and \\\\mu_2 is :W_p (\\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_2) =  a_1 - a_2  . By similar reasoning, if \\\\mu_{1} = \\\\delta_{a_{1}} and \\\\mu_{2} = \\\\delta_{a_{2}} are point masses located at points a_{1} and a_{2} in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}, and we use the usual Euclidean norm on \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} as the distance function, then :W_p (\\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_2) = \\\\ a_1 - a_2 \\\\_2 . =Normal distributions= Let \\\\mu_1 = \\\\mathcal{N}(m_1, C_1) and \\\\mu_2 = \\\\mathcal{N}(m_2, C_2) be two non- degenerate Gaussian measures (i.e. normal distributions) on \\\\mathbb{R}^n, with respective expected values m_1 and m_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n and symmetric positive semi-definite covariance matrices C_{1} and C_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n}. Then, with respect to the usual Euclidean norm on \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}, the 2-Wasserstein distance between \\\\mu_{1} and \\\\mu_{2} is :W_{2} (\\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_2)^2 = \\\\ m_1 - m_2 \\\\_2^2 + \\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{trace}} \\\\bigl( C_1 + C_2 - 2 \\\\bigl( C_1 C_2 \\\\bigr)^{1/2} \\\\bigr) . This result generalises the earlier example of the Wasserstein distance between two point masses (at least in the case p = 2), since a point mass can be regarded as a normal distribution with covariance matrix equal to zero, in which case the trace term disappears and only the term involving the Euclidean distance between the means remains. Applications The Wasserstein metric is a natural way to compare the probability distributions of two variables X and Y, where one variable is derived from the other by small, non-uniform perturbations (random or deterministic). In computer science, for example, the metric W1 is widely used to compare discrete distributions, e.g. the color histograms of two digital images; see earth mover's distance for more details. In their paper 'Wasserstein GAN', Arjovsky et al. use the Wasserstein-1 metric as a way to improve the original framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to alleviate the vanishing gradient and the mode collapse issues. The Wasserstein metric has a formal link with Procrustes analysis, with application to chirality measures , and to shape analysis . Properties =Metric structure= It can be shown that Wp satisfies all the axioms of a metric on Pp(M). Furthermore, convergence with respect to Wp is equivalent to the usual weak convergence of measures plus convergence of the first pth moments. =Dual representation of W1= ‚Äî The following dual representation of W1 is a special case of the duality theorem of Kantorovich and Rubinstein (1958): when Œº and ŒΩ have bounded support, :W_1 (\\\\mu, u) = \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\int_{M} f(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} (\\\\mu - u) (x) \\\\right \\\\text{continuous } f : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\operatorname{Lip} (f) \\\\leq 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where Lip(f) denotes the minimal Lipschitz constant for f. Compare this with the definition of the Radon metric: :\\\\rho (\\\\mu, u) := \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\int_M f(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} (\\\\mu - u) (x) \\\\right \\\\text{continuous } f : M \\\\to [-1, 1] \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. If the metric d is bounded by some constant C, then :2 W_1 (\\\\mu, u) \\\\leq C \\\\rho (\\\\mu, u), and so convergence in the Radon metric (identical to total variation convergence when M is a Polish space) implies convergence in the Wasserstein metric, but not vice versa. =Equivalence of _W_ 2 and a negative-order Sobolev norm= Under suitable assumptions, the Wasserstein distance W_2 of order two is Lipschitz equivalent to a negative-order homogeneous Sobolev norm. (See Theorems 2.1 and 2.5.) More precisely, if we take M to be a connected Riemannian manifold equipped with a positive measure \\\\pi, then we may define for f \\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} the seminorm :\\\\ f \\\\_{\\\\dot{H}^{1}(\\\\pi)}^{2} = \\\\int_{M}  abla f(x) ^{2} \\\\, \\\\pi(\\\\mathrm{d} x) and for a signed measure \\\\mu on M the dual norm :\\\\ \\\\mu \\\\_{\\\\dot{H}^{-1}(\\\\pi)} = \\\\sup \\\\bigg\\\\\\\\{  \\\\langle f, \\\\mu \\\\rangle  \\\\,\\\\bigg\\\\, \\\\ f \\\\_{\\\\dot{H}^{1}(\\\\pi)} \\\\leq 1 \\\\bigg\\\\\\\\} . Then any two probability measures \\\\mu and u on M satisfy the upper bound :W_{2} (\\\\mu, u) \\\\leq 2 \\\\ \\\\mu - u \\\\_{\\\\dot{H}^{-1}(\\\\mu)} . In the other direction, if \\\\mu and u each have densities with respect to the standard volume measure on M that are both bounded above some 0 < C < \\\\infty, and M has non-negative Ricci curvature, then :\\\\ \\\\mu - u \\\\_{\\\\dot{H}^{-1}(\\\\mu)} \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{C} W_{2} (\\\\mu, u) . =Separability and completeness= For any p ‚â• 1, the metric space (Pp(M), Wp) is separable, and is complete if (M, d) is separable and complete.

It consisted of several large holding depots or barracoons for slaves brought from the interior, as well as several palatial buildings for Blanco to house his wives, concubines, and employees. Lomboko was scattered across several small islands at the mouth of the Gallinas River, near Sulima on the Gallinas coast. Spanish slave merchants controlled the area, within the then-British colony and modern-day country of Sierra Leone. By 1839, about 2,000 slaves a year were coming out of the Gallinas River, despite the slave trade being illegal. In 1849, a British Royal Navy expedition attacked the slave factory: the Royal Marines freed the slaves and then destroyed Lomboko completely. The fortress plays a prominent part in the Steven Spielberg film Amistad. In the movie, the main character Joseph Cinqu√©, as well as other slaves, were shown being captured and brought to Lomboko and treated cruelly.

The line followed a difficult but scenic route along the North Yorkshire coast. The line opened in 1885 and closed in 1965 (see Beeching Axe). The route, now a multi-use path, is known as \\"The Cinder Track\\". History =Background= Before the line's construction, several schemes had been proposed that would have resulted in a line between Scarborough and Whitby: the Scarborough, Whitby, Stockton-on-Tees and Newcastle and North Junction Railway, from Stockton-on-Tees, via Guisborough to Whitby and then Scarborough was registered in 1845. Another scheme, the Scarborough, Whitby and Staithes Railway, would connect to the Cleveland Railway near Skinningrove, connecting the towns of the Yorkshire coast, and of North Yorkshire; the line was opposed by the North Eastern Railway (NER), who were improving the Esk Valley Line, and it failed to be given assent in the 1864 session of Parliament. There were other lines promoted to connect along the north coast of Yorkshire between Scarborough and Whitby, including the Scarborough and Whitby Railway Company which issued a prospectus in late 1864. The company placed a bill in parliament, aiming to raise ¬£275,000 capital plus ¬£91,600 in loans, the bill was not opposed in parliament, and was passed at the third reading in April 1865. The line was to be long, and pass Scalby, Burniston, Cloughton, Stainton-dale, Robin Hood's Bay and Hawsker between Scarborough and Whitby. However, the line sanctioned by the 1865 Act was not built due to lack of finance. In October 1865 the NER opened a line between Castleton and Grosmont completing a route between Scarborough, Whitby and the ports of the north-east via the North York Moors, it had also completed improvement works in July, allowing express trains to travel between the two coastal towns in 90 minutes. The NER ran twice-daily express trains over this route, but the service was not profitable, and was withdrawn. =Construction and acquisition, 1872‚Äì1898= Efforts to construct a line restarted in 1870; a new route was proposed, and initial estimates of the cost of the line were approximately ¬£100,000 (). During the same period the Whitby Loftus line was being developed, which with the proposed line would complete the north‚Äìsouth link in the eastern part of the north of the country. The engineer, Mr. Birch, proposed a line starting at Larpool Hall near Whitby, with a 1 in 40 gradient to a station at Hawsker, then stations at Bay Town (Robin Hood's Bay), near Fyling Hall, at Hayburn Wyke, then a station serving Cloughton and Burniston, then Scalby, before terminating near West Parade in Scarborough. A branch line was proposed, from the start at Crowdy Hill in Whitby connecting to the River Esk, where a wharf would be built. An act allowing construction of the new line was passed on 29 June 1871. Construction of the line began on 4 May 1872. The line was engineered by Sir Charles Fox and Son, and cost approximately ¬£27,000 () per mile. Included in the construction was a large 13-arch brick viaduct over the River Esk near Whitby (see Larpool Viaduct). The company needed further acts allowing it to raise extra capital for, and to extend the timescale of the construction, and to make connections with lines in Whitby and Scarborough. In 1878/9 shortage of funds led to the possibility of the scheme being abandoned. The line was opened on 16 July 1885. The NER operated the line until 1898, when the company acquired the railway for ¬£261,633, less than half its capital cost. =Operation, 1898‚Äì1965= The line passed into the hands of the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 Grouping. At the southern end of the route, the goods yard at Gallows Close (north of Falsgrave Tunnel) was expanded for use as a carriage yard in the busy summer months, with excursions routed via the overspill station at sent there for storage between turns. This practice continued after nationalisation of the railway system in 1948. During its operational lifetime the Scarborough and Whitby line became notoriously impracticable and difficult to work. The junction layouts at both ends of the line (Prospect Hill in Whitby and Falsgrave in Scarborough) meant that trains had to reverse direction in order to gain access to the route. These movements, particularly in the days of steam, were time-consuming and disrupted the movement of other trains. This problem was especially acute at Scarborough, where Scarborough Central station was extremely busy during the summer months. The route itself was steeply graded in both directions (1 in 39 being the steepest) and its location along the coast meant that the rails were often slippery due to rain and sea mists. This made driving conditions in bad weather extremely difficult and great skill was needed from the engine crews to prevent trains from stalling on the climbs. Services were dieselised at the beginning of the 1960s. This did much to resolve the reversal issues at Whitby and Scarborough but even these new trains were found to struggle with the gradients, and services were often disrupted when weather and sea conditions were poor. Increasing road competition and a consequent drop in passenger usage outside of the peak summer seasons ultimately led to the route being proposed for closure in the 1963 Beeching Report along with both of the others serving Whitby. A public outcry followed, but this was not enough to keep the line open and it closed to all traffic from 8 March 1965. The closure of the line was marked by the Whitby Moors Rail Tour run by the Stephenson Locomotive Society and the Manchester Lococmotive Society and was hauled by preserved LNER Class K4 2-6-0 no. 3442 The Great Marquess and York shed's K1 2-6-0 no. 62005 (which resides at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in the care of the North Eastern Locomotive Preservation Group (NELPG). = Post-closure = Map of route and surrounding railways The track was subsequently lifted in 1968, although speculation about a potential potash mine near Hawsker meant that the track from there to Whitby remained in place until 1972. The line is now used as a bridleway for cycles, pedestrians and horses, known as the \\"Scarborough to Whitby Rail Trail\\", \\"Scarborough to Whitby Cinder Track\\", or simply \\"The Cinder Track\\". In 2018 plans to spend ¬£3.5 million to repair and improve the Cinder Track were backed by the borough council. The plans would see the route resurfaced, drainage improved and the creation of a new management body to oversee the development of the track. There is also the possibility of introducing a visitor centre, cafe and pay and display parking to generate ongoing funding to maintain the route. Work upgrading the track began in January 2020 and the first stage is now complete.

Name His name has been reconstructed as *Bou[g]nou in Old Welsh, with a proposed derivation from the common Celtic *Bou[o]-gnƒÅw-, with a meaning related to \\"Knowing Cattle\\".Koch, John T. (ed.), Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 206. Life Beuno was said to have been born at Berriew in Powys and to have been the grandson of a prince of the local dynasty, which descended from Vortigern, king of Britain. After education and ordination in the monastery at Bangor in northern Wales, he became an active missionary with the support of Cadfan, king of Gwynedd. Cadfan's son and successor Cadwallon deceived Beuno about some land and, when the saint demanded justice, proved unsympathetic. Thereupon, Cadwallon's cousin Gwyddaint \\"gave to God and Beuno forever\\" his land at Clynnog Fawr on the Ll≈∑n peninsula. Beuno established his own monastery at the site and died there peacefully \\"on the seventh day of Easter\\".Ryan, Patrick W.F. \\"St. Beuno.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2.

He was said to have had a \\"wondrous vision\\" prior to his death. Legacy Eleven churches bear Saint Beuno's name, including one in his monastery at Clynnog Fawr, and one in Culbone on the Somerset coast.

Originally in Byzantine service, he rebelled and seized Smyrna, much of the Aegean coastlands of Asia Minor and the islands lying off shore in 1088‚Äì91. At the peak of his power, he even declared himself Byzantine emperor, and sought to assault Constantinople in conjunction with the Pechenegs. In 1092, a Byzantine naval expedition under John Doukas inflicted a heavy defeat on him and retook Lesbos, while in the next year he was treacherously slain by his son-in-law Kilij Arslan I. Smyrna and the rest of Tzachas' former domain were recovered by the Byzantines a few years later, in 1097. Life Very little is known about his life, and that mostly from only one source, the Alexiad of the Byzantine princess Anna Komnene, daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (). He is also mentioned in the 13th-century Danishmendname as Chavuldur Chaka (),Alexander Daniel Beihammer, (2017), Byzantium and the Emergence of Muslim- Turkish Anatolia, Ca. 1040-1130, p. 272 but it is not a very reliable source due to the semi-legendary nature of its material. According to the Alexiad, Tzachas was originally a raider, who was taken as a prisoner by the Byzantines during the reign of Nikephoros III Botaneiates (). Tzachas entered Byzantine service and advanced rapidly through imperial favour, receiving the title of protonobilissimus and rich gifts. However, when Alexios I Komnenos deposed Botaneiates in 1081, Tzachas lost his position and fled Byzantium.. From ca. 1088 on, he used his base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he captured Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle.Anna Komnene. Alexiad, VII.8 (). Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time may have been in conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete. In 1090/91, the Byzantines under Constantine Dalassenos recovered Chios.Anna Komnene. Alexiad, VII.8 (. Undeterred, Tzachas rebuilt his forces, and resumed his attacks, even proclaiming himself emperor (basileus) and seeking to conclude an alliance against Alexios I with the Pechenegs in Thrace for a joint attack on Constantinople. In 1092, Dalassenos and the new megas doux, John Doukas, were sent against Tzachas, and attacked the fortress of Mytilene on Lesbos. Tzachas resisted for three months, but finally had to negotiate a surrender of the fortress. During his return to Smyrna, Dalassenos attacked the Turkish fleet, which was almost destroyed.Anna Komnene. Alexiad, IX.1 (. According to the Alexiad, in spring 1093, Tzachas attacked the port of Abydos in the Sea of Marmara. Alexios I called upon the Sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum Kilij Arslan I (), who was married to Tzachas's daughter Ay≈üe Hatun and was thus his son-in-law, to attack Tzachas from the rear. The Sultan advanced to Abydos, where, at the pretext of inviting Tzachas to a banquet, he had his father-in-law murdered.Anna Komnene. Alexiad, IX.3 (. However, a \\"Tzachas\\"‚Äîpossibly the original Tzachas' son‚Äîis reported as still holding Smyrna when the Byzantine army under John Doukas recaptured the city.Anna Komnene.

It marked a change in recording location and production team for the band: their previous three albums had been recorded in San Francisco with producer and recording engineer Ryan Greene, but for Operation Phoenix the band traveled to Fort Collins, Colorado to record at The Blasting Room with Jason Livermore and Descendents/All members Bill Stevenson and Stephen Egerton. This marked the beginning of a long-term working relationship: Good Riddance would record all of their studio material at The Blasting Room using the same production team until 2003, when the band slipped into inactivity and singer Russ Rankin started Only Crime with Stevenson. Stevenson and Livermore would return to record and produce Good Riddance's final studio album My Republic in 2006, which was recorded in San Francisco. Rankin later commented that working with The Blasting Room team was a major turning point in recording for the band: > We did our first three albums with Ryan Greene and Ryan Greene is a great > engineer and a really great guy and we learned a lot about being prepared to > record ... his studio know-how was top-notch, his demeanor was top-notch, > and we learned a lot, but when we decided we wanted a change, and we went to > the Blasting Room, it was like...so different ... they knew what we were > trying to do ...

Morris has also won the ValleyStar Credit Union 300 three times, most of any driver. Craftsman Truck Series career Morris made one career start in the Craftsman Truck Series, his major league NASCAR debut, which came in 1997.

Busch Series career Morris made his NASCAR Busch Series debut at the North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, NC in November 1998, driving the No. 84 Chevy. He started 12th and finished in fifth. In 1999 he made 3 races driving the No. 01 Blue Ridge Motorsports Chevrolet. At the Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March, he started in 8th and finished 35th, three laps down. At South Boston Speedway in June, Morris started 26th and finished 7th. In August he made his 3rd and final start of 1999 at Bristol, starting 28th and finishing 29th. In 2000, Morris drove 6 races for Innovative Motorsports in the #30 Little Trees Chevrolet. In his 6 starts, he had a best starting position of 8th at South Boston and a best finish of 28th at South Boston, as well. Morris did not have much success after that, and in 2001 raced his three last NASCAR races. He was 30th and 34th in two races for Jay Robinson Racing, with the better coming at Charlotte and then 40th in a race for Hensley Racing at Rockingham. He is often referred to as one of the greatest late model drivers to have existed, with the general consensus being that his name was what stopped him from breaking into the top levels of stock car racing. At the time, NASCAR's top series was sponsored by Winston, owned by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a competitor of Philip Morris International, which owns brands such as Marlboro.

The cathedral is dedicated to the nativity of the Theotokos. It was erected at the request of the Orthodox parish of Sarajevo, with construction taking place between 1863 and 1868. The church is constructed as a three-section basilica inscribed in a cross-shaped plan, and has five domes. The domes are built on the beams; the central one is much larger than the other four side domes. The church is arched by round elements. The small gilded baroque-style belfry is built in front of the entrance. The interior walls are decorated by painted ornaments. In the lower zones of the walls the painted ornaments are simulating the marble stone construction look. Arches and vaults are decorated in ornaments only. In 1898, the Orthodox Metropolitan Palace was built near the cathedral. The head master for construction was Andreja Damjanov, a man from the Damjanovi-Renzovski family of master builders, masons, painters, carpenters, and stonecutters from the village of Papradi≈°te, near Veles. History The construction of the church commenced in 1863 when Sarajevo was part of the Bosnia Vilayet, itself a subdivision within the Ottoman Empire. Most of the 36,000 dukat construction cost was covered by Sarajevo's Serb merchants, led by Manojlo Jeftanoviƒá who donated 2,000 dukats. In a symbolic act, the Ottoman sultan Abd√ºlaziz and the ruler of Serbia, Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, each donated 500 dukats. Russian Tsar Alexander II sent expert craftsmen to construct the iconostasis. Known locally as the 'New Orthodox Church' to distinguish it from the sixteenth- century church a few hundred meters to the east, it was the first building to break the Muslim monopoly on monumental edifices in Sarajevo. Cathedral during winter Once the church was built, its tower that rose above many of the town's mosques became a sore point with local conservative Muslims who wanted traditional limitations on non-Muslim architecture to be imposed. The same group also objected to a small bell that was installed on the old Serbian Orthodox Church at around the same time. The new church dedication ceremony was scheduled for May 1871; however, a group of forty lower-class Muslims, led by a Sarajevo imam Salih Vilajetoviƒá (better known as Had≈æi Lojo), sought to block it. When notified of the intended obstruction, the Bosnian Vilayet's Ottoman governor ordered the police to arrest Had≈æi Lojo and his followers. Six were arrested while others fled when the police arrived. Led by merchant Jeftanoviƒá, members of the Serbian community lodged a protest with the Russian consul in Sarajevo, and Russian diplomats shortly thereafter protested the episode to the Ottoman sultan. The dedication ceremony was postponed for a year. The next year, in the summer of 1872, the Ottoman officials dispatched a new military commander with more than thousand men in order to provide security for the church dedication. Concerned about local Muslim vandal attacks, as a show of force the Ottoman governor ordered the positioning of a cannon above the city and the deployment of troops to guard the ceremony.

On Saturday, 7 June 1913, he was the first person to reach the summit of Denali (Mount McKinley), the highest mountain in North America. He was followed by the other members of the small expedition team, guide Harry Karstens, Episcopal archdeacon Hudson Stuck, who had organized the effort, and Episcopal missionary Robert Tatum. After gaining more formal education, Harper married in 1918 and planned to go to medical school in Philadelphia. He and his wife took the steamer from Skagway to Seattle for their honeymoon before setting off cross-country. The ship ran aground on a reef in a snowstorm, and was broken up in a gale, sinking on October 25. All 268 passengers and 75 crew were lost. Early life and education The youngest of eight children, Walter Harper was born in 1893 as the son of Jennie Seentahna (n√©e Bosco) Harper, of the Koyukon people from the Koyukuk region, and Arthur Harper, an immigrant from County Antrim, Ireland. They married in 1874 when Harper was 39 and Jennie was 14, at Koyukuk. Harper and his partner Al Mayo founded a trading post in Tanana, near the Athabascan site of Nuklukayet. Harper also did some mining there, after years of experience in California and British Columbia. Mayo married Margaret, a cousin of Jennie. The couple separated permanently in 1895, and Arthur Harper left the area. He died of tuberculosis in 1897. Jennie reared Walter as traditional Koyukon. All the older Harper children had been sent for education to boarding schools \\"Outside\\", mostly in San Francisco, California. Harper's partners also followed this practice for their mixed-race children. At the age of 16, Walter Harper started going to Tortella School, an Episcopal boarding school associated with St. Marks Mission in Nenana, Alaska.Guide to Collection: St. Mark's Mission, Nenana, Alaska; \\"Biographical/Historical Note\\", 2010, State of Alaska Library, accessed 22 September 2013 There he met Hudson Stuck, Episcopal archdeacon of the Yukon, who served a large area of the Interior as a missionary. Stuck was impressed by Harper's intelligence, manners, and skills in fishing, tracking, trapping, fire-building, and dog handling. He hired him to work as his interpreter, guide, and dog driver. He also encouraged him to continue with his formal education. Denali expedition Stuck invited Harper, then 20, to be part of his 1913 expedition to climb Denali. Others in the party were the chief guide and co-leader Harry Peter Karstens; Robert Tatum, an Episcopal missionary, who served as cook; and two Gwich'in teenagers, Johnny Fredson and Esaias George, who helped prepare and maintain the base camp. This pair also brought the dog teams down when the terrain became too rough for their use. On March 17, 1913, the expedition left from Nenana to climb Denali. The first day, they hiked along the Tanana River valley with two sleds of supplies, pulled by fourteen dogs. The trip up the river to Eureka took eight days; there, they replenished supplies and celebrated Easter. It took them weeks to reach their final camp. Their journey had been much longer than expected. They had made it through the steep, crevasse-filled Muldrow Glacier; and a tent fire. But it took them three weeks to get through the Karstens Ridge, where the trail was blocked by huge rocks and blocks of ice thrown up by an earthquake the year before. They also survived a icefall. On June 6, they arrived at their final camp, at an elevation of , the highest camp ever established in North America. At 4:00 a.m. the next morning, the climbers left camp for their final summit push. At 1:30 p.m., the party reached the top of Denali, an elevation of . Harper was the first to gain the summit. They spent an hour and a half on the summit, during which Tatum planted a flag he had made earlier from handkerchiefs. He compared the view to \\"looking out of a window of heaven.\\" Stuck ensured they also put up a six-foot cross. After taking readings from their instruments to establish the height of the mountain, the party began the descent. Compared to the 50-day journey up the mountain, it took them just two days to make it back to base camp. The expedition returned to Tanana on June 20, three months and four days since they left. Later life  Encouraged by Stuck, Harper gained an education in Alaska, while continuing to work on the frontier. He planned to go to medical school in Philadelphia. On September 1, 1918, he married Frances Wells in Fort Yukon, with Archdeacon Stuck officiating. For their honeymoon, the couple took the from Skagway to Seattle. From there, they would travel to Philadelphia, where Harper had been admitted to medical school, and his wife planned to join the Red Cross. They embarked on October 23 at Skagway, and the four-year-old Scottish steamer left at 10:00 that night. A day later, as the ship was passing through Lynn Canal en route to Juneau, she encountered a strong gale and heavy snow. Princess Sophia went off course and ran aground on Vanderbilt Reef, the flat, rocky tip of an underwater mountain. Initially the sea was calm, but another gale came in. The ship asked by radio for help, but neither ships nor small boats could get close enough to rescue the people aboard because of the dangerous conditions. After about 40 hours, Princess Sophia broke apart and sank on October 25, killing all 268 passengers and 75 crew, a total of 343 persons lost. After the Harpers' bodies were recovered, the couple was buried side by side in Juneau. Legacy *In 1913, Stuck named Harper Glacier after the first man to reach the summit. The glacier runs from Denali Pass on Denali to the Great Icefall before becoming Muldrow Glacier. It was also named for Walter's father Arthur. *On June 7, 2012, the 99th anniversary of the first ascent, Alaskan Senator Lisa Murkowski introduced bill S. 2273, to \\"designate the Talkeetna Ranger Station in Talkeetna, Alaska, as the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station.\\" References External links * Walter Harper at peakbagger.com Category:1893 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in Alaska Category:Alaskan Athabaskan people Category:American mountain climbers Category:Deaths due to shipwreck Category:Denali Category:People of pre- statehood Alaska Category:People from Tanana, Alaska ","title":"Walter Harper"},{"id":"6704732","text":"Enterprises in the Soviet Union were legal entities engaged in some kind of economic activity, such as production, distribution, the provision of services, or any other economic operation.

It was a complement to the Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR. While the latter provided Soviet physical education system requirements only for athletes, GTO was a programme for all Soviet people of almost all ages. By the year 1976, 220 million people were awarded GTO badges, while in 1986 the tests were passed by 33.9 million people. Evolution =Pre-World War II= Initially the GTO had one level with three age groups. To earn the GTO badge, an individual needed pass 21 tests, of which 13 had concrete norms. Sports in the country were only beginning to develop; there were a few physical culture collectives by enterprises and organizations, that could organize physical training, and the GTO provided the unique possibility to involve people into sports activities, hence the variety of tests. On December 7, 1932, the second level was introduced for the same three age groups. This was done to stimulate the improvement of skills of those who passed the first level. The second level had 24 tests, 19 of them had concrete norms. Each test result could be one of two: \\"passed\\" and \\"not passed\\". The next change followed in 1934, when the third level had been introduced, with two age groups: for children 13-14 and 15‚Äì16 years of age. This level had a separate name - \\"Be Ready for Labour and Defence of the USSR\\" (), abbreviated as \\"BGTO\\". This defined the structure of the GTO for many years: it had \\"BGTO\\", \\"GTO 1st level\\" and \\"GTO 2nd level\\" stages until 1972. After the structure of the GTO programme was established, next revisions dealt with the system of tests, applicable to evaluate physical conditions of different age groups of the population; improvements in norm requirements; specifying age limits of levels. In 1939 the tense international situation caused the inclusion of tests, necessary to prepare young people for service in the Red Army, and to prepare all the population for the possible war. Such disciplines as \\"crawling over\\", \\"speedy foot march\\", \\"throwing a bunch of grenades\\", \\"rope (also pole and tree) climbing\\", \\"carrying over a cartridge box\\", various martial arts were introduced. Most of them were removed in post-World War II revisions. Only \\"throwing a grenade\\" and \\"50 m small bore rifle shooting\\" (men only) remained. =1945-1972= The 1946 revision, along with the GTO's importance for military and labour activities, emphasized its health protection aspect. In many tests norms were reduced, reflecting the devastation and famine that worsened the health of the people. The 1959 revision saw a new system of evaluation. To earn the GTO badge, a person had to collect a certain number of points, passing all the tests. This stimulated the individual's interest in achieving the best results possible in all tests of the programme. =1972 and beyond= The major changes in the GTO programme were done in 1972, after thorough scientific testing and approval of how it was to be put into practice, carried out by the All-Union NII of Physical Culture. The main principles of the programme were tested on a large scale in Severodonetsk and Salavat. The programme was approved on January 17, 1972 by a decision of the CPSU Central Committee and Council of Ministers of the USSR. The age limits were extended from 14-46 to 10-60 and comprised eight age groups on five levels (as compared to five age groups on three levels previously). Each of the levels () had its name. They were: #\\"Courageous and adroit\\" () - for boys and girls 10-11 and 12‚Äì13 years of age #\\"Sports successors\\" () - for teenagers 14‚Äì15 years of age #\\"Strength and courage\\" (Alternative: Strength and manliness –ú—É–∂ - man) () - for teenagers 16‚Äì18 years of age #\\"Physical perfection\\" () - for men 19‚Äì39 and women 19‚Äì34 years of age #\\"Cheerfulness and health\\" () - for men 40-60 and women 35‚Äì55 years of age There were two badges on each level; the silver GTO badge and the golden GTO badge, awarded to those who passed all the tests, fulfilling the respective norms. On the fourth level, \\"Physical perfection\\", there was also a special GTO With Honours golden badge, awarded to those, who fulfilled all norms required for the golden badge of the fourth level and was the First Class Sportsman in one sports discipline or the Second-Class Sportsman in two disciplines. Among the tests were running (100m, 1000m, 3000m), long jump, high jump, pull-ups, rising up with a turn on the high bar, dummy grenade throwing, cross-country skiing (5 km or 10 km; or 5 km running in southern regions), 50m small bore rifle shooting, swimming (100m with time, or 200m without time). Since 1974 All-Union All Around GTO –°ompetition was held, where the gold medal \\"USSR All Around GTO Champion\\" () was awarded for the first place. In 1975, 37 million people participated in the competition, 500 people competed in the finals. In 1985 the sixth level was introduced - \\"Ready for the start\\" () - for boys and girls 7‚Äì9 years of age. So, the GTO programme comprised almost all ages. =After the breakup of the USSR= After the breakup of the USSR in 1991, the GTO programme was eliminated in the most of former Soviet republics. In Russia the GTO programme did not exist for some ten years, but has begun to be revived since 2003. On March 24, 2014 president Vladimir Putin signed a decree to restore GTO in modern Russian Federation under the same traditional name.

A part of the Italian-American Mafia (or Cosa Nostra) movement, it operates in the Greater Cleveland area. Founded about 1920, leadership turned over frequently due to a series of power grabs and assassinations. Stability emerged in 1930 after Frank Milano became boss. The organization underwent significant decline in the last years of boss John T. Scalish. After his death in 1976, Irish mobster Danny Greene attempted to take over the Cleveland crime family. A violent gang war broke out which drew significant law enforcement attention. Significantly reduced in membership and influence, the Cleveland crime family nearly ceased to exist in the 1990s after a number of high-ranking members were imprisoned. The organization is believed by law enforcement to be extremely small in the 21st century, although attempting to rebuild. History =Early organized crime in Cleveland= Semi-organized Sicilian American- and Italian American-run \\"Black Hand\\" extortion rackets first emerged in Cleveland about 1900. The Cleveland Division of Police soon established an \\"Italian squad\\" (also known as the \\"Black Hand squad\\") to deal with the problem. After a series of Black Hand- related murders in the city in 1906, this police unit largely suppressed this first expression of organized crime in Cleveland. Loosely organized gangs emerged in the 1910s. An Italian American gang known as the Mayfield Road Mob formed in Cleveland's Little Italy neighborhood about 1913. At roughly the same time, another Italian American gang, the Collinwood Crew, formed in the Collinwood neighborhood. This gang centered its activities around the intersection of St. Clair Avenue, E. 152d Street, and Ivanhoe Road. Out of a drug store in Cleveland's Big Italy neighborhood, notary public Angelo Serra ran the \\"Serra Gang\\". It was primarily an automobile theft ring which relied on Serra to forge titles to the cars and create fake vehicle registration plates. At one point in the mid-1910s, it did $500,000 ($ in dollars) a year in vehicle thefts. The gang also engaged in other crimes such as extortion, illegal gambling, the numbers racket, and robbery. In the late 1910s, the \\"Benigno Gang\\" formed under Dominic Benigno in Little Italy. The gang specialized in payroll robberies, and in 1919 and 1920 monopolized payroll robberies by intimidating or murdering anyone who tried to pull off a heist without Benigno's permission. A less organized and more fluid criminal organization was the \\"reservoir gang\\", a group of criminals engaged in armed robbery, automobile theft, burglary, and other property crimes which met at Cleveland's Baldwin Water Treatment Plant reservoir in order to plan crimes, exchange stolen goods, and disperse profits from crime. Prohibition began in Ohio on May 27, 1919, and nationally throughout the United States on January 16, 1920. Many small, organized gangs emerged between 1919 and 1921 to circumvent the liquor law by importing liquor from Canada, diverting alcohol from legitimate purposes (such as medicine and industry), and distilling and distributing home-brewed beer and liquor. Small bootlegging operations were run by formerly legitimate businessmen like Michelino Le Paglia, August L. Rini, and Louis Rosen. A number of small bootleg gangs, run by Jewish residents, began operating in the \\"Little Hollywood\\" area of the Hough neighborhood, an area bounded by Lexington and Hough Avenues between E. 73rd and E. 79th Streets. The brothels, gambling halls, and speakeasies of Little Hollywood became the favorite place to relax for small gang leaders throughout Cleveland, many of whom established their offices in the tiny red-light district. Larger organizations included an Italian American gang centered on Woodland Avenue and E. 55th Street, and an Italian American gang centered on Woodland and E. 105th Street. The Mayfield Road Mob also grew larger as it focused more on bootlegging. =The Lonardo and Porrello brothers= The Lonardo family plot at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio The four Lonardo brothers (Joseph, Frank, John, and Dominic) and seven Porrello brothers, including Joseph Porello, immigrated to the United States from Licata, Sicily. The Lonardo and Porrello brothers first established themselves as legitimate businessmen. The two groups dabbled in various criminal activities including robbery and extortion, before prohibition, but were not yet considered a major organization. At the start of Prohibition, Joseph \\"Big Joe\\" Lonardo was the boss of the Cleveland crime family. He was the second oldest of the four Lonardo brothers. He and his brothers began by supplying Cleveland's bootleggers with the corn sugar they needed to produce liquor. His top lieutenant was Joseph Porrello, who supervised various bootlegging and other criminal operations throughout the early to mid-1920s. =Split factions (1926‚Äì1927)= In 1926, the Porrello brothers (Rosario, Vincenzo, Angelo, Joseph, John, Ottavio, and Raymond) broke away from the Lonardo family and formed their own faction. They established their headquarters on upper Woodland Avenue, around E. 110th St. In 1927, hostilities between the Lonardo and Porrello families escalated as the families competed in the corn sugar business. During Prohibition, corn sugar was the prime ingredient in bootleg liquor. In the summer of 1927, Joseph \\"Big Joe\\" Lonardo, boss of the Lonardo faction at the time, left for Sicily, Italy amongst rising tension between the two families. He left his brother John and adviser, Salvatore \\"Black Sam\\" Todaro as acting heads of the Cleveland family. When Lonardo returned, a sitdown was scheduled between the Lonardos and the Porrellos. On October 13, 1927, Joseph Lonardo and his eldest brother John were to meet with Angelo Porrello in a Porrello-owned barber shop. Inside the barbershop, when Joseph and John Lonardo relaxed into playing a game of cards, they were ambushed and killed by two Porrello gunmen. This allowed Joseph Porrello to take over as boss of the Cleveland crime family and become the most influential corn sugar baron in the Cleveland area. =The Porrellos (1927‚Äì1930)= The grave marker for Joseph and Vincenzo Porrello at Calvary Cemetery (Cleveland, Ohio). Through late 1927 and much of 1928, the remaining Lonardo faction loyalists, which included an up-and-coming Mafia group known as the Mayfield Road Mob (led by Frank Milano) and various Jewish allies within the Cleveland Syndicate, continued to rival the Porrello family for the leadership within the Cleveland underworld. They vied for control of the most lucrative rackets outside of the corn sugar business, which included gambling, the most profitable hustle for American Mafia crime families after bootlegging. To establish dominance, the Porrellos needed backing from the top Mafia bosses in New York, as well as other leading Mafia families across the United States. On December 5, 1928, a high-level American Mafia meeting was held at the Statler Hotel in Cleveland. Joseph Porrello, with the help of one of his top lieutenants Sam Tilocco, hosted the event in hopes that the top Mafia bosses from across the United States would declare him the official Mafia boss of Cleveland. The attendees of the Cleveland meeting became participants to one of the first known La Cosa Nostra summits in American history. Some of the powerful bosses who attended included Joe Profaci and Vincent Mangano of New York. However, the meeting turned into a fiasco as some of the well-known attendees were recognized by local law enforcement and arrested along with their associates. Meanwhile, Mafiosi continued to arrive from across the country for the Mafia summit. The Porrello brothers arranged for their associates to be bailed out of jail. In spite of the chaos, Joseph Porrello was declared the boss and recognized nationwide as head of the Cleveland crime family. On June 11, 1929, Porrello family Lieutenant Sam Todaro was murdered. At the end of Prohibition, most of the Porrello brothers and their supporters had been killed or had sided with the Mayfield Road Mob. On July 5, 1930, Joseph Porrello was invited to a sitdown with Frank Milano at the Milano-owned Venetian Restaurant. Gunfire erupted and boss Joseph Porrello and his underling were killed. Vincenzo \\"Jim\\" Porrello succeeded his brother as Cleveland Mafia boss. Three weeks after his brother's murder, Vincenzo was shot in the back of the head and murdered in a grocery store on East 110th Street and Woodland Avenue in an area considered a Porrello stronghold. Raymond Porrello declared revenge, and on August 15, 1930, an explosion leveled Raymond's home. He was not home at the time. =Mayfield Road Mob (1930‚Äì1944)= Public Square, 1930. In the early 1930s, Frank Milano and the \\"Mayfield Road Mob\\" of Cleveland's Little Italy had replaced the Porrellos as the Cleveland area's premier Mafia group. The Mafia faction was even mentioned by its old name in the movie The Godfather Part II as the Lakeview Road Gang, as Lakeview Cemetery borders Mayfield Road Hill which marks the beginning of Little Italy in Cleveland. This area is also referred to as \\"Murray Hill\\" by locals. This Mafia family was formed in the late 1920s and was headed by Frank Milano. In 1931, Milano joined the National Crime Syndicate, a network of powerful criminals from around the country, such as Charlie Luciano and Meyer Lansky. Milano was now the official boss of Cleveland crime family. By 1932, Milano had become one of the top American Mafia bosses in the country and a charter Commission member. On February 25, 1932, Milano made sure the Porrello family and their gang were finished for good by having Raymond and Rosario Porrello, along with their bodyguard, Dominic Gueli, murdered in a smoke shop on East 110th Street and Woodland Ave. in their old territory while they were playing cards. After this, the remaining Porrello brothers backed out of the Cleveland underworld and fled the area. In 1935 Milano fled to Mexico after being indicted for tax evasion. Alfred Polizzi, another leading member of the Mayfield Road mob, seized power and reigned as boss until 1944 when he was convicted of tax evasion. =Collinwood Crew= The Collinwood Mob, also known as the Young Turks, was based in Cleveland's South Collinwood Neighborhood, was at times integrated with the Mayfield Road Mob and has a Mafia history as old as that of the Mayfield Road Gang. The most notorious of the Collinwood Crew was the late Alfred \\"Allie Con\\" Calabrese. Allie Con was feared and respected in both neighborhoods and known as a stand-up guy, a \\"true gangster\\". His crew consisted of Joe \\"Joey Loose\\" Lacobacci, the late Butchie Cisternino and others from an area that stretched from the 152nd Street bridge, up Five Points and Ivanhoe Road, down Mandalay across London Road to Wayside and over to Saranac bordering the Collinwood Train Yards. =Scalish era (1944‚Äì1976)= John Scalish held the longest reign of any Cleveland mob boss. He took control of the family in 1944, and remained the boss for thirty- two years, until his death in 1976. During his time as the crime family's leader, the group developed ties with important crime figures like Shondor Birns, Moe Dalitz, Meyer Lansky, and Tony Accardo. The Family also became allies of the extremely powerful Chicago Outfit and Genovese crime family. Additionally, The Cleveland mob also expanded its influence to areas throughout the Midwest, as well as California, Florida, and Las Vegas. In the 1950s, the family reached its peak in size, with about 60 \\"made\\" members, and several times as many associates. By the 1970s the family's membership began to decrease because Scalish didn't induct many new members. Scalish died during open heart surgery in 1976 and failed to name a successor beforehand. =War with Danny Greene and decline (1976‚Äì1990s)= After the Death of John Scalish, it was decided by the family's members that James \\"Jack White\\" Licavoli would take over as boss. Licavoli worked for the infamous Purple Gang in Detroit during Prohibition before moving to Cleveland, where he gradually rose up the ranks of the city's underworld. During his reign, an Irish gangster named Danny Greene began competing with the Mafia for control of rackets. This resulted in a violent mob war between the Mafia and the Danny Greene gang, during which there were almost 40 car bombings in Cleveland. This time period earned Cleveland the unofficial title of \\"Bomb City U.S.A.\\". Danny was backed by mob associate and teamster John Nardi, who was killed on May 17, 1977, by a car bomb in the parking lot of the Teamster Hall in Cleveland. After several failed attempts to kill Greene, it became evident that Licavoli's outfit needed outside help. In 1977, Danny Greene was murdered after a scheduled visit to his dentist. After learning of the dentist appointment scheduled by Greene, Licavoli and Lonardo contracted Ray Ferritto to assassinate him. While Greene was in the dentist's office, a bomb was placed underneath a car adjacent to his. Upon return to his vehicle the bomb was exploded remotely. Greene lay under the ruins of his vehicle for at least an hour before his corpse was removed. After Greene's assassination, Ferritto heard that the Cleveland Crime Family wanted him dead and in response became an FBI informant. The information that he provided led to the arrests of many high ranking mafia members, including John Licavoli himself. Eventually, Licavoli was sent to prison for the murder of Danny Greene in 1982. Angelo Lonardo, the son of Prohibition mob boss Joseph Lonardo, took control of the Cleveland crime family. He led the family until 1984 when he was convicted of running a drug ring and was sentenced to life in prison. He then became an informant, making him the highest-ranking Mafia turncoat up to that time. He informed on powerful Mafiosi from numerous families while in prison, and caused serious damage to the Mafia's infrastructure. After Lonardo became an informant, the Cleveland crime family's boss was John \\"Peanuts\\" Tronolone. Peanuts was a long-time Miami Beach resident who prior to becoming the boss, was a South Florida point man for the New York-based Genovese crime family and other mobsters. He was also closely associated with Meyer Lansky. In 1989 he became the only Mafia boss to have the distinction of being arrested in a hand-to-hand undercover transaction by local law enforcement. He accepted jewelry from Dave Green, an undercover Broward County deputy in exchange for bookmaking and loan-sharking debts. He died before he could start his nine- year state prison sentence. In 1978, Cleveland police warned then-mayor Dennis Kucinich that local Mafia members had put out a hit on him because of some of his mayoral initiatives were hindering money-making opportunities. Police told Kucinich that a hitman was planning on shooting the mayor while he marched in The Columbus Day Parade in October 1978. Kucinich missed the parade as he was hospitalized with a ruptured ulcer. However, he took note of the threat and began keeping a gun in his home for protection. The Cleveland Mafia was dismantled by the FBI and other law enforcement officials so aggressively in the 1980s that by 1990 the family only had a few made members left in the street. According to the FBI the Cleveland Mafia started to slowly rebuild the organization by making new members in the late 1990s and all of the 2000s.

Husserl's first published book, it is a synthesis of his studies in mathematics, under Karl Weierstrass, with his studies in philosophy and psychology, under Franz Brentano, to whom it is dedicated, and Carl Stumpf. Structure The Philosophy of Arithmetic constitutes the first volume of a work which Husserl intended to comprise two volumes, of which the second was never published. Comprehensively it would have encompassed four parts and an Appendix. The first volume is divided in two parts, in the first of which Husserl purports to analyse the \\"Proper concepts of multiplicity, unity and amount\\" (Die eigentliche Begriffe von Vielheit, Einheit und Anzahl) and in the second \\"The symbolic amount-concepts and the logical sources of amount- arithmetic\\" (Die symbolischen Anzahlbegrife und die logischen Quellen der Anzahlen-Arithmetik). Content The basic issue of the book is a philosophical analysis of the concept of number, which is the most basic concept on which the entire edifice of arithmetic and mathematics can be founded. In order to proceed with this analysis, Husserl, following Brentano and Stumpf, uses the tools of psychology to look for the \\"origin and content\\" of the concept of number. He begins with the classical definition, already given by Euclid, Thomas Hobbes and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, that \\"number is a multiplicity of unities\\" and then asks himself: what is multiplicity and what is unity? Anything that we can think of, anything we can present, can be considered at its most basic level to be \\"something\\". Multiplicity is then the \\"collective connection\\" of \\"something and something and something etc.\\" In order to get a number instead of a mere quantity, we can also think of these featureless, abstract \\"somethings\\" as \\"ones\\" and then get \\"one and one and one etc.\\" as basic definition of number in abstracto. However, these are just the proper numbers, i.e. number which we can conceive of properly, without the help of instruments or symbols. Psychologically we are limited to just the very first few numbers if we want to conceive of them properly, with higher numbers our short term memory is not enough to think of them all together, but still as identical to themselves and different from all others. Hence, Husserl says, we have to move on to the analysis of symbolically conceived numbers, which are effectively those that are used in mathematics. History The book is a product of Husserl's years of study with Weierstrass (in Berlin) and his student Leo K√∂nigsberger (in Vienna) on the mathematical side and his studies with Brentano (in Vienna) and Stumpf (in Halle) on the psychological/philosophical side. The book is mostly based on his habilitationsschrift of 1887 \\"On the Concept of Number\\" (√úber den Begriff der Zahl). Husserl also lectured on the concept of number between 1889 and 1891, much in the same vein. He continued working on the second volume up to at least 1894. Gottlob Frege was critical of Philosophy of Arithmetic, and accused Husserl of relying too much on the metaphysical and not enough on the logical aspects of mathematics. Frege‚Äôs criticisms influenced negatively the young mathematician‚Äôs career as a professor. Husserl‚Äôs Logical Investigations secured his reputation ten years later, but Frege and others never accepted Husserl as a practitioner of true logic.

His ship was blown to an island, where they were attacked by lions who killed many of the King's men. They eventually come to a garden with fountains of gold, silver, and pearls, with a large castle and lake nearby. The Lake warned them that the seven-headed serpent- king of the island would soon wake and bathe in it; it would devour the men alive if they were found. The only way they could limit their punishment was to spread their clothing over its path, as the softness would appease it. When it discovers the men and what they have done to soften his path, in exchange for their lives the serpent demanded twelve youths and twelve maidens every year, or it would destroy their country. For many years, brave youths and maiden volunteered to save their country, yet all perished. The king and queen in the meantime had no children. One day, an old woman from the Spinning Convent offered the queen an apple that would give her a child. The queen ate the apple, and threw the peel into a pasture where a mare ate it. She had a son, and the mare a foal. When the prince and the horse were grown, the horse said the sacrifice would soon ruin the country and had the prince ride it to the Spinning Convent where the abbess was spinning. She told him to take cotton and go by a secret tunnel to the serpent's palace. There, he would find it sleeping in a bed, hung with bells, and with a sword over it. The sword was the only one that could kill the serpent; it would regrow a new blade for every head, if it broke. He was to stuff the bells with cotton and then wound it in the tail. It would put its heads up, one at a time, and he should cut each one off. He obeyed her and killed it. The animals of the island chased him, but be escaped.

Prior to his arrest, Rubin also published books on the history of economics and contemporary economics, as well as editing an anthology of classical political economy.  Rubin's value theory  Rubin's main work emphasised the importance of Marx's theory of commodity fetishism in the labor theory of value. Against those who counterposed Marx's early interest in alienation with his later economic theory, Rubin argued that Marx's mature economic work represented the culmination of his lifetime project to understand how human creative power is shaped, defined, and limited by social structures, which take on a uniquely \\"objective\\" economic form under capitalism. Significantly, Rubin is at pains to argue that simple commodity production is not a historical phenomenon that developed into capitalism, as it is often understood by both Marxists and critics of Marx; rather, it is a theoretical abstraction that explains one aspect of a fully developed capitalist economy. The concept of value, as understood by Rubin, cannot exist without the other elements of a full-blown capitalist economy: money, capital, the existence of a proletariat, and so on.  Persecution and death  Rubin was arrested on December 23, 1930, and accused of being a member of the All- Union Bureau of Mensheviks, a fictitious secret organisation. Rubin, a trained lawyer and an economist, outwitted his first interrogators and the first charge was dropped; he was then transferred to a cell in Suzdal, where he was placed in solitary confinement and subjected to sleep deprivation. On January 28, 1931, Rubin was brought to another cell, where he was shown another prisoner and told that if he did not confess, the prisoner would be shot. Rubin refused and the prisoner was executed before him. The process was repeated the next night. After the second shooting, Rubin negotiated a \\"confession\\" with his interrogators, who insisted that he implicate his mentor David Riazanov as a member of a secret Menshevik conspiracy. At 1931 Menshevik Trial, Rubin refused to confirm the existence of a Menshevik organisation. Although he agreed to make false statements regarding Riazanov's correspondence with other secret Mensheviks, he claimed that this was done on the basis of \\"great personal trust\\" rather than organisational discipline. As a result of this failure to fully cooperate with his prosecutors, Rubin was sentenced to five years in prison. Although he attempted to shield Riazanov from the worst charges, Rubin emerged from the experience \\"morally broken, destroyed, degraded to a state of complete hopelessness\\". Rubin served most of his prison term in solitary confinement, during which he continued his research as best as he could. When he fell ill with a suspected cancer, he was removed to a hospital and encouraged to make further confessions in return for favourable treatment, but declined the offer. He was released on a commuted sentence in 1934 and allowed to work in Aktyubinsk, Kazakh SSR as an economic planner. Rubin was arrested once more during the Great Purge in 19 November 1937. After this arrest he was never seen alive again. He was executed under the accusation of Trotskyist conspiracy in 25 November 1937  Influence and legacy  Rubin's work was never reissued in the Soviet Union after 1928, but in 1972 Essays on Marx's Theory of Value was translated into English by Fredy Perlman and Milos Samardzija. This work became a foundation stone of the \\"value-form\\" approach to Marxist theory, exemplified by Hans-Georg Backhaus, Chris Arthur, Geert Reuten, and the \\"Konstanz‚ÄìSydney\\" group (Michael Eldred, Mike Roth, Lucia Kleiber, and Volkbert Roth). In this interpretation of Marx, \\"it is the development of the forms of exchange that is seen as the prime determinant of the capitalist economy rather than the content regulated by it\\". Capitalism is here understood as a method of regulating human labor by giving it the social form of an exchangeable commodity (the \\"value-form\\"), rather than a disguised or mystified system that is otherwise similar in content to other class-based societies. According to Arthur, the rediscovery of Rubin's \\"masterly exegesis\\" was \\"the most important single influence on the value form approach to Capital\\".

It is considered that the area near to the local Park Hall Primary and Infant schools and the Gillity Village shops are classed as Park Hall. Park Hall estate, an area of Walsall, is close to the other Walsall suburbs of Chuckery, Yew Tree, and The Delves and is separated from Streetly by countryside and by the local landmark Barr Beacon. It is in the Walsall South parliamentary constituency; the local MP is Valerie Vaz of the Labour Party. The previous long-standing MP was Bruce George who retired just prior to the candidates being declared for the 2010 general election. The Gillity Village shops are the central point of Park Hall, containing a mixture of food and other shops. Further shops can be found on the estate at the junction of Gillity Avenue and Edinburgh Road. There are four pubs in and near to the estate. Sir William Joseph Pearman-Smith of Park Hall The area is named after Park Hall, built in 1863, which was the home of Sir William Pearman- Smith (b.1864) who was knighted by King Edward VIII on 19 February 1936. He died in 1939. A solicitor, he was a senior partner in the law firm Messrs Pearman-Smith and Sons, established by his grandfather. He was a governor of Stowe School. Pearman-Smith was Walsall's mayor from 1899 to 1902. Park Hall was demolished in the 1950s. Park Hall primary school was opened on the site of the hall in 1970. It outgrew its original building, so a junior school, which was used as a community centre until 2013, known as Park Hall Community Centre, was built next door, opening in 1974. The community centre has since moved and is no longer located in Park Hall. No community activities take place at the school since it became an academy in 2012. It was the first purpose-built Junior Community School built in the UK. Park Hall infant and junior school are mixed and secular. The school took grant-maintained status in January 1994. The infant school teaches over 300 pupils with students' standards in national tests being in the highest five per cent of the country upon leaving. Park Hall Junior School has over 400 pupils and it is the 9th ranked junior school out of 80 in the Walsall region in the aggregate score across the three test subjects of English, Maths and Science.

It comprised what is now County Leitrim, County Cavan and parts of neighbouring counties, and corresponds roughly to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore. It had emerged by the 10th century, as a confederation of ' headed by an overking drawn from the U√≠ Bri√∫in Br√©ifne. By the 11th century, Br√©ifne was ruled by the Ua Ruairc (O'Rourke) dynasty. The kingdom reached the height of its power in the 12th century, under Tigern√°n Ua Ruairc. During the latter part of his reign, Br√©ifne took part in campaigns against the Norman invasion of Ireland. His assassination by the Anglo-Normans in 1172 was followed by a succession dispute, and a conflict between the Ua Ruairc and Ua Raghallaigh (O'Reilly) dynasties. Following the Battle of Magh Slecht in 1256, Br√©ifne split into West Breifne (ruled by the Ua Ruairc) and East Breifne (ruled by the Ua Raghallaigh). Br√©ifne was part of the province of Connacht until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. In that time it was shired into the modern counties Cavan and Leitrim, Leitrim remaining a part of the province of Connacht while Cavan became part of Ulster.  History  Septs of Breifne c. AD 700 is said to derive from an obsolete Irish word meaning \\"hilly\\", a description which describes the topography of this part of Ireland. But this derivation is opposed by the likes of O'Connellpage 4 and MacEoin. It was referred to as the rough third of Connacht. Alternatively, the Metrical states the name is derived from , daughter of , the grandson of Nemed, a brave soldier-woman. She was slain by Regan after whom Tomregan is supposedly named.Part 71 of The Metrical Dindshenchas In ancient times the area that became known as Br√©ifne was said to be occupied by the Erdini, called in Irish 'Ernaigh', who possessed the entire country bordering Lough Erne. At the time of the Christianization of Ireland (c. 5th‚Äì6th century) groups believed to be in or near Breifne included the Glasraighe, Masraige, Dartraige, Armhaighe, Gallraighe, the Fir Manach, and the Gailenga. Around the 6th century a people known as the Conmaicne Rein are thought to have moved north from around the present Dunmore in County Galway and settled in Magh Rein (the area around Fenagh). From here they peopled what is now South Leitrim, which became known as Magh Rein, and its inhabitants as the Conmaicne Magh Rein. They consisted of different family groupings ‚Äì Muintir Eolais, Muintir Cearbhallain (O Mulvey), and Cinel Luachain, among others. About the 8th century, the area since known as Breifne was conquered and settled by the U√≠ Bri√∫in who were a branch of the royal family of Connacht. The U√≠ Bri√∫in established themselves first in modern county Leitrim and then into what is now County Cavan. It can be argued that there is no contemporary evidence to support these speculations. By the 9th century the √ì Ruaircs had established themselves as kings of Breifne. In the 10th and 11th centuries the √ì Ruairc kings of Breifne fought some battles for the title of king of Connacht, four different kings of Breifne gaining the title. During the 12th century the reign of Tighearn√°n Ua Ruairc, the kingdom of Breifne was said to comprise most of the modern counties of Leitrim and Cavan, and parts of Longford, Meath, Fermanagh and Sligo. In the 16th century Breifne O'Rourke eventually became County Leitrim and Breifne O'Reilly became County Cavan.  Territories  The following territories were at one stage part of Breifne. * Cen√©l Cairpre (Cairbre) ‚Äì northern County Sligo and northeast County Leitrim. The territory of Coirpre, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages, around the 6th century extended from the Drowes west to the Owenmore River in Ballysadare. Duncarbry (Dun Chairbre) marks the border of Cairbre's territory on the Drowes, while the Barony of Carbury in North Sligo still reminds us also today. Noted chiefs of Cen√©l Cairpre included √ì Maolchloiche (O'Mulclohy). * Cairpre Gabra ‚Äì northern County Longford, barony of Granard. √ì Ron√°in (O'Ronan) were lords in the barony of Granard until dispossessed by the √ì Fearghails in the 13th century. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, about 476 AD, the Battle of Granard was fought by Eochaidh, son of Cairbre, son of Oilioll, son of Dunlaing, son of Enda Niadh against the Ui Dunlainge, Ui Bri√∫in Cualann and Ui Fergusa of North Leinster. * Cen√©l Laegaire ‚Äì County Fermanagh. The Fir Manach, the Cin√©al Eanna and the Cen√©l Laegaire were early indigenous tribes in the County Fermanagh area. The Cen√©l Laegairi mic Neill were noted west of Loch Erne (Book of Lecan). The Cen√©l Laegairi mic Neill were also noted in central Ireland (Mide, Meath).

She was also known as Josephine Deborah Russell, Mrs. Eugene Erwin, Josephine Erwin, Mrs. John M. Clay, and Josephine Clay. Life as Mrs. Erwin Born in Fulton, Missouri, she was a daughter of William Henry Russell (1802-1873). In 1853 Josephine Deborah Russell married a grandson of Henry Clay named Andrew Eugene Erwin. Prior to the Civil War, the couple had three daughters. During the war, Erwin served in the Confederate Army, rising to the rank of Colonel and commanding of the 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment. In 1863 Josephine Erwin brought the couple's nine-year-old daughter, Lucretia (Lula), to join Andrew Erwin who was part of the force defending Vicksburg. Andrew Erwin was killed in the Battle of Vicksburg, one week before the end of the Union siege. On July 18, 1863, the pregnant Josephine Erwin met with General Ulysses S. Grant to obtain passes allowing Lula and her to return to Missouri. Josephine Erwin bore her fourth daughter in 1864, but the girl died shortly after her birth. Racing and breeding thoroughbreds The Clay Family invited her and her three surviving daughters to move to Lexington, Kentucky and supervise the household of John Morrison Clay, Henry Clay's youngest son, a bachelor. John had inherited a portion of his father's estate, Ashland. To distinguish John's lands from Ashland proper, which went to his brother James Brown Clay, John's farm was variously called Ashland-on-the-Tates-Creek-Pike, Ashland Stock Farm, and Ashland Stud. Josephine and John were married in 1866. They had no children, but poured their time and energy into training and racing horses for about twenty years. John Clay traveled the racing circuit throughout the East, South, and Midwest. Josephine ran Ashland Stud. Their famous race horses included Skedaddle, Survivor, Star Davis, Sauce Box, Squeeze 'em, and Victory. In 1873, Victory was bought by General George Armstrong Custer, who called him Vic and rode him at the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876. It is believed Vic died in the battle. Focus on breeding Following her husband's death in 1887, Josephine Clay focused on breeding and selling yearlings. She inherited from John Clay twelve brood mares, all descendants of Henry Clay's brood mares Magnolia and Margaret Wood. Through 1900, Josephine Clay built her stock to more than fifty brood mares and two stallions and gained recognition as the first woman to own and operate a successful thoroughbred horse farm. She gained national recognition when Riley, a horse she had bred, won the 1890 Kentucky Derby. In 1903, Josephine Clay dispersed her stock due to her failing eyesight and new laws in New York and other states prohibiting betting on horses. She died at her home and is interred at Lexington Cemetery.

John M. Corridan (1911-1984) was a Jesuit priest who fought against corruption and organized crime on the New York City waterfront. He was the inspiration for the character of \\"Father Barry\\" in the classic film On the Waterfront. Biography Son of a County Kerry-born policeman in New York's Harlem, Corridan graduated from Manhattan's Regis High School in 1928. Father Corridan was assigned to the Xavier Institute of Industrial Relations on Manhattan's West Side in 1946. He became a passionate advocate of reform in the International Longshoremen's Association waterfront union. Father Corridan collaborated with Malcolm Johnson in Johnson's articles on waterfront corruption. He was the subject of a 1955 biography, Waterfront Priest by Allen Raymond. The introduction of the book was by Budd Schulberg, screenwriter of On the Waterfront, who described how he met with Father Corridan frequently in researching the screenplay. Schulberg described Father Corridan as a \\"tall, youthful, balding, energetic, ruddy-faced Irishman whose speech was a fascinating blend of Hell's Kitchen jargon, baseball slang, the facts and figures of a master in economics and the undeniable humanity of Christ.\\" Schulberg wrote that Father Corridan \\"led me to understand that there is nothing unusual about a Catholic priest's involving himself in moral issues that find practical form in the daily lives of his parishioners.\\" According to a 1983 article in the New York Times, Father Corridan's work was instrumental in formation of the New York-New Jersey Waterfront Commission aimed at curbing waterfront crime. Father Corridan, then retired, told a Times reporter that he believed that conditions on the waterfront had changed over the years. The Times reported: \\"When he visited some former colleagues in Manhattan last year, he recalled, current conditions on the docks were barely discussed. 'I'm sure if anything of consequence were going on,' he said, 'somebody would have gotten in touch with me.'\\" Father Corridan left the waterfront in 1957 to teach economics at Le Moyne College in Syracuse. He later taught theology at Saint Peter's College in Jersey City and served as a hospital chaplain in Brooklyn. Corridan died of a heart attack on July 1, 1984 at the Misericordia Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 73 years old and had lived in a health- care center at Fordham University.

The local media quickly names the mysterious attacker \\"Four-eyes\\" (Le Bigleux in the original version, lit. \\"the poor-sighted\\") based on the police composite. Hinano (Hinano Yoshikawa) is a seventeen-year-old girl who works part-time as a hairdresser. She lives with her older brother Roy, a police officer (Tetta Sugimoto) assigned to the \\"Four-Eyes\\" case. While in the subway, she notices a young man secretly filming other passengers, and, intrigued, begins to follow him. Later, she asks her friend and co-worker Naomi (Kaori Mizushima) to join her investigation into the strange young man. She finally approaches K, and they quickly become friends. He invites her to his apartment and shares his interests of trance music and video games with her. Hinano is suspicious, but she relents, and finds herself in the middle of a romance with the unconventional young man. In the meantime, Four Eyes is still at large, and Roy's investigation is not closer to finding the shooter. Hinano witnesses one of K's shootings, and is conflicted about what she should do with this knowledge. Hinano confronts K, and K explains that he modified his pistol to be inaccurate, presumably so that the bullets don't actually hit its target. However, later on K accidentally kills one of his victims - a man who was breaking up with a girl for a different girl. In a second confrontation, K reveals that he uses the thick glasses to cause his victims to hold still, and so that he himself cannot see his victims clearly. He admits that he would not be able to shoot his victims if he looked them in the eye. In addition, he takes video because of a desire to see what is going on in the world, not just look. Despite having much video footage of people, he says it is hard to see. But K explains to Hinano that he is willing to give it all up, and refers to Four-Eyes as someone he can separate from, which puts Hinano at ease. K is visited by a low-ranking yakuza member (Beat Takeshi) who comes to pick up K's handgun which was apparently on loan, but it is accidentally fired into K's lower abdomen. K does not go to the hospital, but instead meets Hinano and walks around with her. K asks Hinano to meet him at the top of the tallest building in Tokyo. Hinano waits at the top of an observation deck, but K, succumbing to his wound, sways dangerously by the curb of a busy street. In the last sequence, Hinano is walking down the street. Her hand is grabbed; she looks up and sees K's smiling face. The ending is ambiguous, since it is not clear whether K died. It should be pointed that the international version, including the Japanese one, features seven minutes of additional footage, and possibly a more explicit ending compared to the original cut.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Jason Buchanan of AllMovie gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"A curious hybrid of French sensibilities and Japanese aesthetics, Tokyo Eyes weaves the intriguing tale of a wannabe killer and the girl who falls for him to visually extravagant, but somewhat hollow, effect.\\" Derek Elley of Variety commented that \\"Mostly shot in hand-held style, but with care rather than abandon, the film at least has a natural, untouristy feel for Tokyo's tangled geography and does not try to impose a faux-Japanese rigor to its visual makeup.\\" Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times called the film \\"intriguing but ultimately irresolute\\". Reece Pendleton of Chicago Reader wrote, \\"The film may never fully attain the emotional resonance it seems to be striving for, but it's still an accomplished and interesting piece of work.\\" At the 8th Japanese Professional Movie Awards, Hinano Yoshikawa won the Best New Actress award.

In 1992 the church and associated buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also designated a Milwaukee Landmark.  History  St. John's congregation was founded December 4, 1848, by German immigrants, who called themselves Evangelische Luth. St. Johanneskirche. In 1850 they moved into the former Trinity Episcopal Church at the corner of Fourth and Highland Ave. with Members of the church, along with neighboring Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church and Grace Lutheran, helped seed other Lutheran churches in the area, including St. Peter's. In the 1850s there were discussions to merge St. John's and Trinity, but theological differences prevented the merger. In 1857 St. John's joined the Wisconsin Synod. St. Johanneskirche grew for years, building schools in 1871 and 1877. By 1889 the congregation exceeded 2,500 members, and it was time for a new, larger building. St. John's hired Herman Paul Schnetzky, himself a German immigrant from Wriezen, to design the new church. He and his understudy Eugene R. Liebert designed it in a High Victorian Gothic style similar to what was popular in Germany at the time, perhaps taking cues from the tower of St. Peter's Church in Leipzig. It was built in 1889-90 by Johann Langenberger. As with the Trinity Church building, it features landmark spires of unequal height, one and the other . The taller steeple houses three bells, weighing more than . The main block of the church is gable-roofed with cream brick walls pierced by tall Gothic-arched windows. Inside, the auditorium is 2.5 stories tall, seating 1100, with a center-aisle layout and the apse at the north end, with an elaborate carved reredos and an elevated pulpit. The NRHP nomination considers St. John's to be important as an illustration of how Milwaukee's German-American architects were influenced by German architecture of the same period. The church is considered to be one of the finest examples of German Lutheran church architecture in the United States. Also in 1889, the congregation built a parsonage designed by Schnetzky. The parsonage is two stories, cream brick, in rather simple Queen Anne architectural style. The caretaker's house was built in 1914, a side- gabled bungalow with walls stuccoed. St. John's conducted services solely in German until 1908. In that year services in English were added. The German services continued until 1985. Since its founding, St. John's has been the site of a number historical events including the founding of the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America in 1872. It has also hosted numerous Milwaukee and synod church events including the 2016 Reformation Rally for the Urban Conference of Wisconsin Synod Churches in Milwaukee. In 2015 the former Caretaker's Cottage underwent a restoration and now serves as the Congregation's fellowship center The church's organ was first built by Carl Barckhoff in 1890, and was rebuilt and enlarged by Wangerin-Weickhardt in 1919. William Schaefer has pastored the church since 2016.

It is set at 1,070 m above sea level on the southern slopes of Rila with the westernmost Rhodope Mountains to the east and Pirin to the south near the valley of the Mesta River. Dobarsko is 80 km from Blagoevgrad and 17 km from the winter resort Bansko. the village has a population of 672 and about 200 houses, the mayor being Nikola Naydenov. According to the legend, Dobarsko was founded by soldiers from Bulgarian tsar Samuil's blinded army after the Battle of Belasitsa in 1014, who arrived in the area en route to the Rila Monastery and discovered a holy spring that allegedly cured them. Dobarsko is first mentioned in Tsar Ivan Shishman's donor's charter from the Rila Monastery in 1378. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria Dobarsko established itself as the most important and richest village in the Razlog Valley. Many of the locals were merchants who bought cotton from Northern Greece and sold it in Central Europe and grazed large herds of cattle in the mountains and the plains around Drama and Serres. However, Dobarsko began to lose its former importance in the late 18th century, as Bansko rose to become the centre of the region. Dobarsko is known for its 25-metre waterfall, Shtrokaloto, its two old Eastern Orthodox churches and the many consecrated grounds and chapels in the area, as well as the view of three of Bulgaria's highest and largest mountains from the village. The Church of Theodore Tyro and Theodore Stratelates, a small three-naved stone basilica half dug into the ground, was constructed no later than 1614 (with some sources claiming as early as 1122) and painted in 1672. The church donors, Bogdan, Hasiya and his son, as well as the builders Spas, Stanko and Smilen, are depicted in a donors' fresco left of the door. The church is noted for its abundance of original frescoes and icons, some of which are interpreted as portraying Jesus in a rocket. The holy spring in the church yard is said to be curative and indeed the one that cured Samuil's soldiers that founded the village, as depicted in one fresco. A small swastika and a cross on the eastern wall are the only items in the exterior that show that the small stone building is a religious temple. The frescoes were cleaned up and partially restored in 1974‚Äì1978, and the church is a national monument of culture, as well as one of the 100 national tourist attractions. The other church, the Church of the Purification of the Virgin, is a richly decorated Bulgarian National Revival work on the opposite side of the road dating to 1860. Other chapels and consecrated grounds around Dobarsko include the Goatherd's Church, the Dug Church, St Elijah, St Spas, St Athanasius, the Holy Trinity, the Holy Theotokos, St Demetrius and St George. According to several travellers' accounts, Dobarsko was the centre of a famous beggars' school of blind singers that spread all over the country and existed until 1939. The beggars also invented a cant for their own use by uniting Bulgarian, Greek, Vlach and Roma vocabulary, and performed heroic epic songs.

Sixty were driving motors, fifty were driving trailers, and forty were trailers. =Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway= For the GNP&BR;, 218 cars, seventy-two motor cars and 146 trailers, were built, the order being split between Les Ateliers de Construction du Nord de la France, at Blanc-Misseron, France and Hungarian Railway Carriage and Machinery Works, in Gy≈ër, Hungary. Two cars were also built in Britain, one by the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon Co and one by Brush Electrical Engineering Co Ltd. The cars, built in both France and Hungary, were shipped unfinished to England where they went to Lillie Bridge depot where they were prepared for service. Seating on the GN&PBR; cars was forty-two in the motor cars and fifty-two in the trailers, the seats were rattan-covered. Livery was Midland lake. Conversion to air-operated doors Only twenty cars, all driving motors, were converted for air-operated doors. These were all French built cars and were converted in 1920 for use with the 1920 stock. These lasted until 1930 when they were replaced by 'Standard Stock' driving motors. A few of these cars were used as ballast motors while two were rebuilt into double ended cars and used on the Aldwych branch until the 1950s. Although it was not the only stock to have gates, the 1906 Stock seemed to be the only one that earned the nickname \\"Gate Stock\\". Entry and exit was by the end platforms, being protected by lattice gates, and operated by gate-men stationed between cars. The gate-men opened and shut the gates as well as passing the signal to start from car to car until the driver received it. One anomaly remained until the 1980s to remind of the original \\"Gate Stock\\". This was the \\"Gateman's Allowance\\" paid under a 1927 agreement to the guards until around 1985, to compensate for the guard now having to operate all the doors on the train.

Overview The series starred Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk as Nick and Nora Charles. The dog, Asta, was played by three identical wire-hair terriers. Jack Albertson, Patricia Donahue, and Nita Talbot had recurring roles during the show's second season. Albertson played Lieutenant Harry Evans of the New York Police Department. Donahue played Hazel, Nick and Nora's neighbor. Talbot played Beatrice Dane, alias Blondie Collins, a criminal who dragged Nick and Nora into her schemes. Both Hazel and Beatrice made attempts to seduce Nick. Nora's jealousy fueled her sarcasm on these occasions. A newspaper columnist wrote that Nora Charles's role was different from that of other female leads in detective programs on television. Kirk commented: > We were the first of the sophisticated detective dramas, and from the > scripts it was simple to see that the part of Nora Charles was that of a > leading lady who made more than token appearances. Since then some of the > new shows just use girls as part of the scenery. Among the series guest stars was Billy Gray, who appeared at the same time he was cast as James \\"Bud\\" Anderson, Jr., in Father Knows Best. Ann McCrea was cast as Billie in the 1958 episode, \\"The Lost Last Chapter\\".

Early life Douglas Blackwood was a great-great-grandson of William Blackwood who founded William Blackwood & Sons the publishers and Blackwood's Magazine. He was educated at St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne and Eton. On completing his education, he had little choice but to follow his father into the family firm. However he held a short service commission in the RAF from 1932 to 1938 and had it not been for the outbreak of World War II, he would have returned to Edinburgh to work for his father and uncle.Trevor Royle, \\"Obituary: Wing Cdr Douglas Blackwood\\", The Independent, 7 March 1997 RAF service He rejoined the RAF in 1939 and, being a naturally gifted fighter pilot, commanded No. 310 Squadron RAF a Czech fighter squadron during the Battle of Britain.Fighter Command British Armed Forces, 1.08.1940 In August 1940 during the Battle of Britain, he was forced to bale out over Clacton. After a night of German bombing of the City of London, he was on dawn patrol and from his plane at 25,000 feet over the North Weald he could see the thick smoke from the fires which destroyed Blackwood's business premises in Paternoster Square. He ended the Second World War as Wing Commander commanding the Czech Fighter Wing in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. He was decorated with the Czech War Cross and Czech Military Medal and was presented with the Czech Medal of George of Podƒõbrady in 1993.Account of Czech pilot Publishing Blackwood left the RAF in 1945 and found the publishing business to be in a shocking state. The Blitz had destroyed millions of books as well as Blackwood's base in London and heralded a decline in the firm's fortunes.Greenhill Military Book News No 126 The night the book trade burned Before the war William Blackwood & Sons had been one of Britain's leading literary publishers, but in the post-war world its name and literary reputation counted for little. Blackwood was managing director of the firm and editor of Blackwoods Magazine from 1948 to 1976. Blackwoods had to deal with an increasing number of mass-production rivals and with a decline in interest in monthly literary magazines. By the 1970s Blackwoods and its magazine appeared out-of-date and failed to attract a younger generation of writers and readers. It was an achievement that the magazine survived until 1980. Blackwood retired from the editorship in 1976, being the last member of his family to edit the magazine which bore his name. He remained chairman of the publishing house until 1983. His biographer, Trevor Royle noted that Blackwood, being shy, could appear remote or aloof, although he was considered \\"a kindly man who wore his learning lightly\\". He was most comfortable in military company and never courted literary or political society. He had little literary pretension - when a reviewer asked if he had known George Orwell at Eton - he was six years his junior there and at St Cyprian's - Blackwood replied, \\"Oh, Blair, yes I remember him, he had a motor-bicycle.\\" However Blackwood's dismissive comment may have a different interpretation as he published an article in his magazine that vigorously refuted Orwell's criticisms of their prep school.W J L Christie St Cyprians Days Blackwoods Magazine May 1971 In retirement Blackwood lived in the Scottish Borders, where he enjoyed field sports and country pursuits. He died in Edinburgh. Family Blackwood married Phyllis Caulcutt, an equestrian rider and an expert exponent of dressage, in 1936 and they had a son and daughter. His son Michael, a former naval pilot, succeeded him in the business but by then the firm had amalgamated to concentrate on printing.

July 26, 1980. 290. Aspen ceased operations on April 1, 1990 when separate portions of the airline were acquired by Mesa Airlines and Air Wisconsin Services, Inc. History Aspen Airways was named after the aspen tree and not the town of Aspen, Colorado where it was originally based before moving its headquarters to Stapleton International Airport (DEN) in Aurora, which was a comparatively small town at the time located outside of Denver, Colorado. Aspen Airways was founded in 1952 by Walter Paepcke, as the flight department of the Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies. It was created to fly personnel between Aspen (ASE) and Denver (DEN). The airline's first aircraft were surplus Douglas DC-3s. Two Convair 580s of Aspen Airways wearing variations on the company colour scheme at Denver Stapleton in 1986 In 1963, Aspen Airways was purchased by J.W. \\"Bill\\" Ringsby. During the late 1960s, Aspen operated a Convair 240 prop aircraft leased from Alaska Airlines and by 1970 was operating four Convair 340/Convair 440 prop airliners which were purchased used from Delta Air Lines. In the early 1970s, Aspen began operating Convair 580 turboprop aircraft. The twin engine CV-580 propjet became the workhorse of the Aspen fleet. Other aircraft operated by Aspen Airways in the 1960s included a Fairchild F-27 turboprop (which didn't work out very well in the high density altitude conditions that can occur at high elevation mountain airfields), and piston and turboprop variants of the de Havilland Heron as well as Piper Navajo and Aero Commander 500B aircraft. A major competitor on the Aspen- Denver route for many years was Rocky Mountain Airways which operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops. RMA then introduced new de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 four engine turboprop aircraft that were configured with 50 passenger seats. In 1985, Aspen Airways acquired new British Aerospace BAe 146-100 four engine jetliners which featured quiet technology with regard to engine noise as well as short takeoff and landing performance and began operating the first commercial jet airliner service into Aspen. It also inaugurated BAe 146 jet service from Denver to Amarillo (AMA) and Lubbock (LBB), from Denver to Farmington (FMN) and Durango (DRO), and from Denver to Gillette (GCC) and Sheridan (SHR). The BAe 146-100 is the smallest member of the British Aerospace 146 family of jetliners, many of which currently remain in operation in Europe as well as other parts of the world although not in the U.S. except in aerial fire fighting roles as converted air tankers. In September 1986, Aspen Airways became a United Express affiliate carrier, providing passenger feed to and from the United Airlines hub in Denver (DEN). By 1986, Aspen Airways was providing seasonal BAe 146 jet service from Aspen nonstop to Dallas/Ft Worth (DFW), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), Houston (IAH), Chicago (ORD) and Long Beach (LGB). Aspen Airways also provided scheduled passenger airline service at Lake Tahoe Airport (TVL) located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California at one point. Convair 580 turboprops were flown on nonstop services to Burbank (BUR), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO) and San Jose (SJC) in California. At the same time, Aspen was also operating Convair 580 service between Los Angeles and Bakersfield (BFL). The airline even offered Convair 580 flights on the very short hop between Los Angeles International Airport and Burbank Airport as an extension of the Lake Tahoe service. The front cover of the September 1, 1980 system timetable for Aspen Airways had the message: \\"Specializing in service to.....Lake Tahoe, California & Aspen/Snowmass, Colorado.\\" Service from Denver also included flights to Colorado Springs, Durango, Gunnison, Hayden, Montrose, and Rifle in Colorado as well as to Farmington, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, Sioux City and Waterloo, Iowa, and Cheyenne, Sheridan and Gillette in Wyoming. The airline also operated nonstop service at one point between Salt Lake City (SLC) and Aspen, Jackson Hole, Wyoming (JAC), and West Yellowstone, Montana (WYS). Essential Air Service was operated between San Francisco and Modesto (MOD) and Stockton (SCK), California in 1982. In 1989, Aspen offered itself up for sale. Several suitors attempted to purchase the airline. Its employees attempted to acquire the airline, but were unable to come up with the capital. Next, the Giant Group, a conglomeration of cement and recycling companies, offered to purchase the airline, but their offer fell through. In the end, Mesa Airlines acquired Aspen's Denver hub and routes except for the Denver to Aspen route, stations and ground equipment. Air Wisconsin Services Inc., the parent company for Air Wisconsin, acquired all of Aspen's common stock, its Aspen routes, and its BAe 146 and Convair 580 aircraft. In April 1995 during the late ski season, Air Wisconsin was operating shuttle service as United Express with BAe 146 jets on the former Aspen Airways route between Aspen and Denver with no less than fourteen (14) daily nonstop flights in each direction.departedflights.com, April 2, 1995 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Denver flight schedules Air Wisconsin Services continued to operate Aspen Airways as a wholly owned subsidiary separate from its Air Wisconsin airline from 1990 until April 3, 1991 when it merged the two airlines together. And the nearly 40 year legacy of the airline that pioneered service from Aspen, Colorado came to an end. Final Fleet & Replacement Air Service at Aspen At the time of the separate sale and merger, Aspen Airways operated four BAe 146 jets and ten Convair 580 turboprops. The Convair 580 turboprops were parked and eventually sold while Air Wisconsin continued to fly the BAe 146 jet aircraft as this regional carrier already operated the BAe 146 in their fleet. Mesa lost its United Express status in the late 1990s and then regained it several years later following a litigation settlement. Air Wisconsin, the original United Express carrier and Aspen Airways' merger partner, eventually lost its United Express partnership contract following protracted negotiations with United Airlines. The United Express routes from Denver and other cities to Aspen are currently flown by SkyWest Airlines with Canadair CRJ-700 regional jets. These United Express aircraft feature United First Class, United's Economy Plus, and United Economy Class with a total of 66 seats. The SkyWest CRJ-700 aircraft provide nonstop jet service on behalf of United from Aspen year round to Denver and also on a seasonal basis nonstop to Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. American Eagle also operates the Canadair CRJ-700 regional jet from Aspen on behalf of American Airlines with seasonal nonstop flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth and Los Angeles. The last of the BAe 146 aircraft that pioneered scheduled passenger jet service into Aspen in the mid-1980s was retired in 2006.

The manufacturer says it has been produced in small series for export to an unidentified government customer in the United States.  Design  The vehicle was named after the yarar√°, a South American venomous snake. The Yarar√° was developed by Nostromo Defensa under contracts from the US Southern Command with a system comprising three aircraft delivered in June 2006. Evolution of the design has seen an increase in the width of the undercarriage footprint to support rough field landings, while a Zenoah 6.5 hp engine is an option. The first powerplant is a Modellmotoren 3W 5.5 hp two stroke system. The current Yarar√° is powered by a single Sonic 35 multifuel air-cooled wankel rotary engine which produces 5.9KW of output power. It is fitted with a three-bladed propeller at the rear of the fuselage section raised on an engine pylon with integral fuel tank. This engine is designed and built by British company Cubewano. It is the first kerosene-powered (heavy fuel) rotary engine flown on a UAV that can use JP8 as fuel. It was first flown in this configuration in August 2009. The Wankel engine has electronic injection.

It served previously as the Royal Palace (often known as the New Royal Palace), until the abolition of the monarchy by the 1973 referendum.  History  The decision to construct the building which currently is used as the Presidential Mansion was made in 1868. That year, King George I's son, Constantine, the heir to the throne, was born and the Greek state decided to present him with a private dwelling, when he came of age. Twenty-one years later when Constantine married princess Sophia of Prussia, the state assigned the planning of \\"The Crown Prince's Palace\\", as the building became known, to Ernst Ziller. Building began in 1891 and was completed six years later in 1897. On Christmas Eve, 1909, a fire destroyed a large part of the Royal Palace (now used by Parliament), with the result that the Crown Prince's Palace was used temporarily as the residence of the royal family. After the assassination of George I in 1913 and the accession of Constantine to the throne, the Crown Prince's Palace finally became the main royal residence of the King of the Hellenes. The use of the building as a Palace was interrupted in 1924 when the monarchy was ended and a Republic was declared. It was then used as the Presidential Mansion until 1935 when the monarchy was restored and the King returned. Since 1974, when democracy was restored after a seven-year military dictatorship, the building has been used as the Presidential Mansion and the residence of the President.  Location  The land on which the Presidential Mansion was built was, until the final decades of the nineteenth century, outside city limits. The eastern limit of the town was the Royal Palace. Beyond that, there were fields and small farms. The only buildings appearing on the maps of the period were the manor of the Duchess of Plaisance (known as \\"Ilissia\\" and today housing the Byzantine Museum) and the Petraki Monastery, both built in country areas far from the centre of town. The limited significance of the area at the time may be revealed by the fact that a girl's orphanage (which no longer exists) was built there in 1854. Furthermore, the land along Kifissias Avenue (now named Vasilissis Sofias Avenue) also remained unbuilt and was reserved by the state for the construction of ministry buildings. In early 1870 the State allowed the sale of land to private individuals which resulted in the construction of mansions to house the wealthy families of Athens. About 1890, the architect Ernst Ziller was entrusted with the construction of the Crown Prince's Palace. This palace later became the residence of the Royal Family and is used now as the Presidential Mansion. During modern times, with the city of Athens extending over many square miles, the Presidential Mansion is located near the centre of the capital next to the National Garden and Parliament. Herodou Attikou Street, where the Mansion is located, is not only one of the most beautiful roads in the city, it is also bound to the political and social life of Greece, as also situated there is the Maximos Mansion where the Prime Minister of Greece has his official office. The Presidential Mansion with its garden occupies a total area of about 27,000 square metres (about 7 acres). The official entrance to the Mansion is on Herodou Attikou Street.  Design and construction  The original Ernst Ziller's architectural plan of the ground floor Ziller's plan for the extension to the ballroom of the crown prince's palace The design of the palace was entrusted to architect Ernst Ziller. He became the Official Court Architect of King George I and designed an estimated 700 buildings all over Greece for both official and private use. It is said the King George I ordered Ziller not to make the building too pretentious, so it would blend with the other mansions on the street, and not to model it after any other palaces in Europe. Following these guidelines, Ziller designed a three-story, symmetrical, neoclassical mansion. Construction of the palace took six years.  Additions  Since this was to be the Crown Prince's Palace, no large ballrooms were included in the design since it was believed that most large scale, official entertaining would occur in the much larger Old Royal Palace. The palace's main reception room was the large salon on the second floor. However, when the palace became the main royal residence, a large ballroom became needed. So, in 1909, Ziller was again commissioned to design an extension which was used as a ballroom and is now named the Credentials Lounge. Another extension was needed when Princess Sophia of Greece (now queen of Spain, and daughter of King Paul and Queen Frederica) became engaged to Juan Carlos I of Spain. In 1962, the King commissioned architect Alexander Baltatzis to design an addition which became the largest room in the palace and is now named the Reception Hall.  Gardens  The garden of the Presidential Mansion occupies an area of about 25,000 square metres (just more than 6 acres) and constitutes a green haven in the centre of Athens. During the middle of the nineteenth century, this area, because of its especially fertile soil, was in fact the vegetable garden of the Royal Palace (now Parliament building). After the construction of the mansion in 1897 and the construction of Herodou Attikou Street, the area which surrounded the Crown Prince's Palace was fashioned into a large ornamental garden. The planning of this appears to have been assigned to Ziller's technical office. The selection of suitable plants, though, must have been entrusted to a Greek specialist, since most of the trees are native to Greece. From the very beginning the garden was divided into two large sections because of the slope of the land. The building is situated in the upper section. The design of the garden in front of the building was similar to that of other neo-classical structures of the period (the Academy, the University and the National Library). The garden follows a relatively rigid geometric plan of the French type, with symmetrical plots of grass and seasonal flowering plants. The formalism of the composition approaching Herod Atticus Road is alleviated by the perennial plane trees, lindens, palms and cypress trees.  Functions  The Palace has served as the offices and main residence of the Crown Princely couple, Royal Family and President of the Republic, respectively. Since 1913, it is also where all official functions are held in Athens. Since the mid-1970s, the President holds a reception on 24 July every year to commemorate the restoration of democracy in 1974. The reception is attended by the political, military, and academic leadership of the country, and of all sectors of the economy and various organizations, along with news reporters.

Some writers say that Cape Jazz began to emerge in 1959 with the formation of The Jazz Epistles, many of whom were from Cape Town, including Abdullah Ibrahim, then known as Dollar Brand. Cape Jazz is similar to the popular music style known as marabi, though more improvisational in character. Where marabi is a piano jazz style, Cape Jazz in the beginning featured (though not exclusively) instruments that can be carried in a street parade, such as brass instruments, banjos, guitars and percussion instruments. History Although there are strong influences from the American jazz, the development of Cape Jazz ran in a similar way to the course of American jazz but in the early 20th century. Being born in a similar political climate to that in New Orleans, Louisiana, at the end of the 19th century, the blues songs that inspired this genre told of local occurrences in Cape Town. An example is the inspiration of the visits of the southern confederate raider CSS Alabama to the Cape in 1863 and 1864, resulting in the folk song \\"Daar kom die Alibama\\". The leading exponents of this style of music in the 1970s are pianist Abdullah Ibrahim (then known as Dollar Brand) and saxophonists the late Basil Coetzee and Robbie Jansen. These three, together with bassist Paul Michaels, drummer the late Monty Weber and sax man Morris Goldberg, recorded the seminal Cape Jazz song \\"Mannenberg\\". Composed by Brand/Ibrahim, the song takes its name from the notoriously crime-ridden creole working-class township on the Cape Flats of Cape Town. The township was one of several created by the apartheid regime following the clearing of the urban slum quarter known as District Six, home to many artists and musicians. Their US American contemporaries in the jazz field were taking on board rock and funk influences. Brand and his group were still being influenced by the more ethnic blues music. Like the comparable music of New Orleans, Cape Jazz was mainly inspired by the blues and folk songs sung by creole people descended from the former slave communities living in the Western Cape, known loosely as the Cape Coloured or Cape Malay people. A street carnival parade or Mardi Gras (also called the Coon Carnival) is held each year peaking on 2 January. This event is the culmination of months of musical and dance rehearsal and community- based competitions, by various mostly mixed-race folk, and was known as Tweede Nuwe Jaar (Afrikaans). The performers, known as Klopse, borrowed the painted faces and bright consumes of the minstrel show style of New Orleans and combined this with African and European music that was to be heard in the taverns and night clubs of the port city. Some of this music is also more recently known as Goema, or Ghoema Jazz (also written \\"guma\\" ‚Äì Jonas Gwangwa), referring to a particular wooden barrel-shaped Asian-style drum (also known in the Cape as a Ghomma) played by the revelers in the almost totally creole troupes in the aforementioned parade. There is a new generation of Cape Jazz musicians of which the band called The Goema Captains are a good example. The group featured Mac McKenzie, Alex van Heerden and Hilton Schilder, who have brought greater improvisational elements to this music. They have literally re-arranged Cape traditional songs and jazzed them up. The young Van Heerden was killed in a motor accident in 2009, but not before releasing two very modern albums of his own, inspired by this genre and his time spent under Robbie Jansen's teaching. Another example is The Cape Jazz Band, an all-star ensemble drawing its players from different groups performing in Cape Town. Other leading names in the genre are pianist Tony Schilder, guitarist Errol Dyers, bass player and composer Steven Erasmus and the Gugulethu-based saxophonist the late Winston Mankunku. The first commercial reference to Cape Jazz in South African music is on the record label compilation of Mountain Records artists released in 1993. The album collected the work of several of the label's acts over a 12-year period beginning in 1981. The thematic similarity in the instrumental compositions, all of which are original, very clearly illustrates this genre. The album contained another Cape Jazz gem in the Jonathan Butler track \\"7th Avenue\\". The compilation was the inspiration for the collation and publication of a sheet music collection of Cape Jazz composers (see below). In September 2006, the Cape Town Jazz Orchestra was launched with a concert promoted by the Arts and Culture department of the South African government. This project brought together 16 musicians from all over South Africa to perform arrangements of works by different jazz composers including Abdullah Ibrahim, who also performed at the concert, and a piece dedicated to and inspired by the late Basil Coetzee. Since the launch, the orchestra has changed from being one with performers from the whole of South Africa to a collection of Cape-based players. From 2008 they became known as the Cape Jazz Orchestra under the musical leadership of Alvin Dyers. This should not be confused with The Cape Jazz Band, a group under the leadership of jazz drummer Jack Momple, who contributed to many of the most famous Cape jazz recordings. An international breakthrough for the genre came when a compilation of recordings entitled Cape Jazz 3 - Goema entered the prestige European World Music Charts in May 2008. Until this point this music was seen as jazz, although many songs performed by the exponents are jazzed-up folk music standards from the Cape and thus justify being considered as \\"world music\\". The album contains work from Robbie Jansen, Dollar Brand, Chris McGregor, Basil Coetzee, Errol Dyers and others. In 2010 the aforementioned Mac McKenzie composed and scored his orchestral piece entitled \\"Goema Symphony number 1\\", a Cape Jazz inspired piece that was given its debut with a full orchestra in Cape Town in 2011. A new name in the genre is the young pianist Kyle Shepherd, a student of the late Robbie Jansen and past member of Jack Momple's ensemble, who issued three solo albums with very strong roots material in 2008, 2010 and 2012. Momple's own ensemble, the Cape Jazz Band (CJB), got together in 2013 to make a new album of purely Cape Jazz songs composed by him and his band members, entitled Musical Democracy. Since then in 2018 a collection of Cape Town-based pianists have come together to perform some of the classics of the genre under the title of Cape Jazz Piano. Among those names on the credits are Ibrahim Khalil Shihab (Chris Schilder), Ramon Alexander, Mike Perry, Hilton Schilder and Mervyn Africa. Sheet music collection In 2008 music researcher Colin Miller together with publisher Nick Green of jazz.co.za, released the first ever sheet music collection of Cape Jazz compositions arranged by Jannie van Tonder, entitled the Cape Jazz Collection. The tunes included in this anthology are a modest part of the large body of music composed by some of Cape Town's premier jazz musicians. These include Winston Mankunku Ngozi, Merton Barrow, Basil Coetzee and Robbie Jansen who, among others, are household names in South African jazz. Though the genre existed long before official Apartheid, it has become a popular belief that these musicians provided anthems of resistance, challenged the Apartheid State through cultural activism and kept their fans dancing through the 1980s towards electoral freedom in the early 1990s. Post-1994 saw the emergence of younger musicians, equally dedicated to the promotion of local music. Due to a new political dispensation, they had increased opportunities for professionalism in music. Among these are Paul Hanmer, Mark Fransman and Buddy Wells, whose compositions are also included in the Cape Jazz Collection.

It was constructed in 1925 and stands at 13 floors in height. Today it contains a bar, restaurant, retail space, office space, a parking garage, and the shared coworking space Cowork at The Michigan. The current owner, Bagley Acquisitions Corp., offered the structure for auction in 2014 with a minimum requested bid of $1 million, but received no offers. The high-rise was constructed in the Renaissance Revival. The exterior of the building is faced with brick with terra cotta and granite accents. The ground level contains retail space with large windows still framed by the original decorative metal work.  History  It opened August 23, 1926 and was designed by the architectural firm of Rapp & Rapp for Detroit philanthropist and movie theater owner John H. Kunsky. The theater's construction cost $5 million (equivalent to $62 million in 2008). With a seating capacity of 4050, the concert hall/movie house was one of the largest in Michigan. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the theater changed ownership several times. It was subsequently used for various events: in the 1960s a closed-circuit television provided views of Red Wings ice hockey games for those who could not attend the actual event in nearby Olympia arena, and in the 1970s the theater was a nightclub and concert venue for rock bands. Upon its completion the Michigan Theater could seat 4,050 patrons, although theatre developer John Kunsky boasted 4,500 seats. In addition to films in its prime years, the theatre hosted performances of bands led by John Philip Sousa, Benny Goodman, Jimmy Dorsey and Harry James as well as live performances by The Marx Brothers, Betty Grable and Bob Hope. The theater ceased operations in 1976 after operating as a nightclub named The Michigan Palace. After the closure, office tenants threatened to leave unless they received adequate parking. To retain the tenants, building owners gutted and converted the theater into a parking structure. The theater could not be completely demolished and replaced by a parking structure because it is integral to the structure of the office building. The ornate plaster ceiling of the theater auditorium and grand lobby, at the ninth floor level, are still intact, as are parts of the mezzanine, the 2nd and 3rd balcony foyers and their staircases. The projection booth is also still intact. The Michigan Theater was built on the site of the small garage where Henry Ford built his first automobile (the garage was transported brick-by-brick to The Henry Ford Museum in nearby Dearborn). The ninth floor was used for filming the donut contest in the series three premier episode of The Grand Tour, entitled \\"Motown Funk\\". The great arched window over the entrance is a false as the grand lobby is approximately behind the window. This false window (largest of its kind in the country) has a curved back wall with over 50 ornate mirrors that reflected the light from chandelier out to the street. Although the tall narrow chandelier is gone, new lighting has been installed within the 5 story tall window chamber. The Michigan is featured in several films: in 8 Mile, where the crew rapped before entering the Chin Tiki restaurant space; in The Island, where it is a structure of the Los Angeles of the future; in Street Kings: Motor City; in Alex Cross; and in Transformers: Age of Extinction.Detroit News, August 9, 2013 Multiple episodes of the television show Detroit 1-8-7 have also filmed scenes in the space. During a scene in Only Lovers Left Alive set in the building, the main protagonists discuss its history as an example of cultural change and decay.

Its ruins are now known as and are located near Carvoran, Northumberland, in northern England. It is thought to have been sited with reference to the Stanegate Roman road, before the building of Hadrian's Wall, to which it is not physically attached. In fact the Vallum ditch unusually goes north of the fort, separating it from the Wall. The fort is now the site of the Roman Army Museum.  Name  The fort at Carvoran is generally identified with the 'Magnis' which appears both in the Ravenna Cosmography and the Notitia Dignitatum. Further evidence for the name comes from a fragmentary inscription (RIB 1825) apparently seen by William Hutchinson in 1766 but which is now lost, which referred to \\"numerus Magnee(n)s(ium)\\" (\\"of the unit of Magn[...] ....\\"). The name could be a Latin nominative form Magni, or Magna, and the fort is today sometimes referred to under the name \\"Magna\\". The name is rather inappropriate for a relatively small fort, and one suggestion is that it could ultimately derive from the Celtic word maen meaning \\"stone\\" or \\"rock\\".  Roman fort  Magnae was originally built to guard the junction of the Maiden Way with the Stanegate, the key supply route linking Coria (Corbridge) in the east to Luguvalium (Carlisle) in the west. As such it predates Hadrian's Wall. Its ruins are located at Carvoran in the civil parish of Greenhead in the English county of Northumberland. Magnae is one of 16 Roman forts along Hadrian's Wall; there were also 80 smaller milecastle forts and 158 turrets along its length. The Maiden Way ran south from Magnae to Bravoniacum (Kirkby Thore near Penrith). An intermediate fort half-way between the two on the Maiden Way was Whitley Castle or Epiacum, just north of Alston in Cumbria, though the fort itself is just over the county boundary in Northumberland.  Archaeology  Artifacts recovered at Magnae include a iron spearhead, found at a depth of in a well, and the well-known modius, a bronze grain- measure.John Collingwood Bruce, The Roman wall, 1853  Roman Army Museum  Magnae is the location of the Roman Army Museum run by the Vindolanda Trust. Like the museum at Vindolanda, the Roman Army Museum was modernised and reopened in 2011. The museum illustrates frontier life on the northern edge of the Roman Empire. The museum displays genuine Roman artifacts including weapons and tools; life-size replicas; a 3D film showing Hadrian's Wall past and present, and a large timeline of Hadrian's Wall. There is a gallery devoted to the emperor Hadrian himself. A large gallery describes daily life in the Roman army as seen through the eyes of a team of eight auxiliary soldiers, complete with a film showing their activities. Notable exhibits include a rare surviving helmet crest.

It has a coastal location at Nancekuke Common, approximately north east of the village of Portreath in Cornwall, England. Its radar (housed in a fibre glass or golf ball protective dome) provides long-range coverage of the south western approaches to the United Kingdom. Second World War Handley Page Halifax of No. 295 Squadron RAF based at Holmesley South, getting airborne from Portreath, Cornwall, towing Airspeed Horsa glider to Tunisia, during Operation Beggar, 1943 Previously known as RAF Portreath, the station was built during 1940, opened in March 1941 and had a varied career during the Second World War, initially as a RAF Fighter Command station, from October 1941 as a ferry stop-over for aircraft bound to/from North Africa and the Middle East, as a temporary stop-over for USAAF and RCAF units, and then as a Coastal Command station. By the end of the war, it had run down and in May 1950 was handed back to the government by the RAF. Chemical weapons centre  The base reverted to its local name Nancekuke and became an outstation of Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) Porton Down. Manufacture of the nerve agent Sarin in a pilot production facility commenced there in the early 1950s, producing about 20 tons of the nerve agent from 1954 until 1956. Nancekuke became an important factory for stockpiling the UK's Chemical Defences during the Cold War. Periodically, small amounts of VX were also produced at Nancekuke. Production of VX agent was intended mainly for laboratory test purposes, but also to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass-production. However, full-scale mass-production of VX agent never took place. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant at Nancekuke was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production of chemical weapons could easily re-commence if required. In 2000 it was reported that former workers at the Nancekuke base had died as a result of exposure to nerve gas, and the matter was raised in the Houses of Parliament.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/608113.stm It was alleged by The Independent that toxic materials had been dumped in nearby mineshafts.https://www.questia.com/library/1P2-5082731/ministry-admits- chemical-war-dump Works to cleanse the site began in 2003.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/3188995.stm Further uses Many of the CDE buildings were demolished in 1979-1980. From 1978-1981, some buildings on the site were used by Pattern Recognition Munitions for small arms ammunition development. The company also constructed a 100-yard firing range for ammunition testing. The RAF re-opened parts of the site as a manned radar station in October 1980, a Control and Reporting Post (CRP) for UK Air Surveillance. In 1986 an underground CRP was built as part of the new UKADGE (United Kingdom Air Defence and Ground Environment) project. New mobile radar systems manufactured by Marconi Electronic Systems, including an S723 Martello (RAF Type 91), and telecommunication installations were added during the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s, the installation became remote operation, and the primary radar was replaced with the British Aerospace (BAe) Type 101. The radar now in use at Portreath is a Type 102 Air Defence Radar. The surrounding area is occasionally used for rallying. Portreath's parent station was RAF St. Mawgan for administration but data was routed to RAF Neatishead.

Orderline: 313/534-1466 o k[(C) 1988 ELECTRONIC ARTS]n } Festering Hate (also known as hate) and CyberAIDS are the names of the first two Apple ProDOS viruses. CyberAIDS appears to have been a series of viruses with minor changes in the code, culminating in the final version called Festering Hate, which appeared in 1988 (The Festering Hate World Tour - Festering Hate in '88). When the virus went off, the title page credited \\"Rancid Grapefruit\\" and \\"Cereal Killer\\" of the \\"Kool/Rad Alliance!\\" The phone number embedded in the detonation page was apparently the home number of John Maxfield (also known as \\"Cable Pair\\") a well-known FBI informant and private investigator of the era, whose specialty was computer crime and hackers. Unlike the few Apple viruses that had come before, such as the Elk Cloner virus, that were essentially annoying but did no damage, the Festering Hate series of viruses was extremely destructive, spreading to all system files it could find on the host computer (hard drive, floppy and system memory) and then destroying everything when it could no longer find any uninfected files. CyberAIDS Although there are references and message threads about CyberAIDS appearing on Usenet as early as 1985 and 1986, CyberAIDS seems to have attained critical mass in 1987 when it finally spread out of the pirate underground, where the payload was originally attached to cracked software, and hit the mainstream networks of the time and began affecting legitimate users. Festering Hate Festering Hate was the last iteration of the CyberAIDS code-base and seems to have bridged the virus from underground pirate BBS systems to the mainstream, by way of a shareware telecommunications application called Zlink. In fact, the original impression was that Zlink itself was nothing but a Trojan horse that delivered a viral payload. During the spread of CyberAIDS, there were apparently a variety of Apple II programmers of the time who wrote virus detection software and sold it to protect people from Apple ProDOS viruses. Since the only viruses that existed at the time (and the only viruses that such programs would detect) were CyberAIDS and Festering Hate, the \\"Kool/Rad Alliance\\" appears to have released the final version of the code-base to include a sarcastic taunt directed at Glen Bredon, one of the programmers who was selling anti-virus software. The last strain of the CyberAIDS/Festering Hate variants appears to have been released in 1988 and was fixed by Morgan Davis, who put an end to feud between the \\"Kool/Rad Alliance\\" and the writers of anti-virus software by releasing VirusMD for free. Even so, within months VirusMD became a commercial product. By this point the authors of the CyberAIDS and Festering Hate code-base appear to have lost interest in their virus and the Apple II platform itself. Legacy A description of the behaviour of CyberAIDS was published in the Summer 1988 issue of 2600 Magazine, by The Plague of MOD. (See post #000038)An image of the cover of 2600 Magazine, Volume VI, Issue 2, Summer 1988 can be seen here The source code is not known to be available. The article which appeared in 2600 was interesting for a variety of reasons. In addition to publishing a de facto \\"how to\\" guide for potential virus writers, \\"The Plague\\" showed a remarkable understanding of the damage he caused, while demonstrating no remorse for his actions and perhaps inadvertently disclosing some of the behind-the-scenes information regarding the pseudonyms of people involved, namely the LOD members Lord Digital (a.k.a. Cereal Killer) and Dead Lord (a.k.a. Rancid Grapefruit), who later launched MindVox. There are \\"easter eggs\\" scattered throughout a variety of that era's documents and files, seeing their last appearance in MindVox-era texts,See textfile archive and Patrick Kroupa's parody of William Gibson's Agrippa.Available for inspection in the EFF Publications Archive from 1992 here References to the virus appear very openly in mainstream media pieces about Kroupa and Fancher. The last traces of recognition for Cereal Killer and The Plague appear in Rafael Moreu's 1995 film, Hackers. The credits for the movie include former LOD member Dave Buchwald and 2600 Magazine publisher Eric Corley. Additionally, IMDb lists Nicholas Jarecki and Bruce Fancher as uncredited consultants, who apparently wanted their names removed from the film after seeing the direction it was taking. While The Plague's 1988 article made it relatively obvious that Lord Digital was Cereal Killer, and Dead Lord was Rancid Grapefruit, the real identity of The Plague himself remains unknown.

Frank Baum Wizard of Oz books by Carolina Caribbean Corporation under the guidance of Grover Robbins, who had been successful with Tweetsie Railroad, and designed by Jack Pentes. It was fully operational until 1980. As of September 2019, it now opens for Fridays in June for \\"Journey with Dorothy Tours\\" and in September for Autumn at Oz ‚Äì the largest Wizard of Oz festival in the country. History =Construction= Brothers Harry and Grover Robbins in 1965 began looking for a way to turn ski resort Beech Mountain into a year-round attraction. Finding an area that reminded them of The Wizard of Oz (1939 film), the brothers began work on an Oz based theme park. They had over 44,000 bricks glazed yellow.https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/travel/why-north- carolinas-land-of-oz-theme-park-closed-and-why-its- reopening/83-561ded12-de72-49df-80b6-aaa915f40737 The songs that were lip- synced by the characters on the Yellow Brick Road and at Emerald City were composed by notables Alec Wilder and North Carolina native Loonis McGlohon (with the exception of E.Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen's \\"Over the Rainbow\\" for which rights were obtained to integrate into the Emerald City show). =Opening= Land of Oz opened on June 15, 1970, with actress Debbie Reynolds cutting the ribbon with her daughter Carrie Fisher. A ski lift was specially designed to become the hot air balloon ride which has since been redeployed to be a ski lift on the back bowl, now Oz run, of Ski Beech. In later years, characters from the story conducted tours, but the original design was for the visitor to assume the role of Dorothy ‚Äì experiencing everything from Kansas to tornado to the meeting the characters on the yellow brick road to Oz. The visit culminated in Emerald City, where Dorothy appeared with her friends to meet the Wizard. Visitors would start off in Kansas, \\"experience\\" the tornado which struck Dorothy's house, and walk down the Yellow Brick Road to visit with the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion and the Wicked Witch of the West. The original Emerald City consisted of gift shops and an amphitheater that the Magic Moment Show would be staged every half hour. An artificial balloon ride, a specially modified ski lift installed by Goforth Brothers, allowed visitors to get a bird's-eye view of the park and mountain scenery before leaving Oz. A small museum showcased props and costumes from the MGM film, including one of Judy Garland's Dorothy dresses. This was jointly bought by the park and Debbie Reynolds from MGM. The park was the top attraction in the Eastern United States the first year. Its opening day in 1970 attracted 4,000 visitors. Dampened by the death of owner Grover Robbins a few months before the park opened, the driving force to keep the park as a special experience gave way to commercial necessities foisted on Carolina Caribbean Corp (CCC) by the downturn in real estate sales. A failed investment in St. Croix left CCC bankrupt the latter part of 1975. =Closure= On Sunday, December 28, 1975, a fire was set to the Emerald City Amphitheater, and surrounding gifts shops. Two buildings were destroyed, along with the park's offices, costumes, sound equipment, and props. At the same time, many items were stolen from the park's museum, including Judy Garland's Dorothy dress. There is some speculation that the fires were set by disgruntled employees. Land of Oz would be rebuilt and managed by a new company, but it never recouped. Some reports state that the quality of the original park was not recaptured, and the cost to restore the park deemed too high. It would finally close in 1980. After the park was closed much of it fell into disrepair. Props were vandalized, stolen, or left exposed to the elements. Some of the park was saved, including most of the yellow brick road, a few munchkin houses, some of the later costumes, and sections of the witch's castle were preserved. A video and display of The Land of Oz were on exhibit at the Appalachian Cultural Museum, part of Appalachian State University, in Boone, North Carolina but the museum closed and the artifacts were returned to the park. =Re-opening= On July 4, 1991, the park was re-opened for the day as part of the town of Beech Mountain's Independence Day celebration and as a kickoff to the redevelopment of the property into a condo complex. Visitors rode the ski lift up from the base of the adjacent Ski Beech. Watauga High School in nearby Boone, N.C. had staged a production of The Wizard of Oz as its spring musical a few months earlier and the student actors appeared in character and in costume to greet visitors as they came off the ski lift. Visitors then made their way to Dorothy's house, which was then the home of the property's owner, Alex Hufty Hays, and viewed a collection of original costumes and props from the 1939 movie. A year or so prior to this event, Appalachian State University in Boone opened its Appalachian Cultural Museum, which featured props and costumes from the theme park. The floor in this portion of the museum was paved with surplus yellow bricks that had been donated by their manufacturer, Sanford Brick, which had been made for the park but never used. The owners of the land began restoring portions of the park over the upcoming years. In the mid-nineties, the Autumn at Oz event began as a reunion for original park employees. This quickly grew in popularity as an annual public event, and by 2009 the festival had over 8,500 people attending. The event has expanded to include all of the characters from The Wizard of Oz, shows, Museum, Emerald City set up, Omaha Vendor Fair, Petting Zoo, Pony Rides, and other activities within the Oz Theme. Money raised during this event go back into renovations and upkeep of the park, as well as adding new attractions each year. In 2011, the park hosted the International Wizard of Oz Club and some of the original 1970 cast returned to share photos and tales from the original inspiration of Jack Pentes. By 2013, the Land of Oz expanded openings to include \\"Journey with Dorothy,\\" a guided tour through Oz every Friday in June during Beech Mountain's Family Fun Month. In 2018, it was announced a new yearly event is to be introduced. Urban explorers often visit the park, shooting photos near or stealing relics from the site, including pieces of the yellow brick road. The park has an annual Autumn of Oz event. Also, in June 2018, the park was scheduled to open for tours led by Dorothy, with some guests playing other characters, on Fridays and on June 30. For the 80th anniversary of the 1939 movie, the park will open Thursdays and Fridays in June 2019, plus the last Wednesday in June and the first Friday in July.

He is perhaps best remembered because of his involvement with the Altamira paintings. Cartailhac was born in Marseille. He became interested in prehistory (studies of which were then just beginning) at a very young age. He made excavations around the dolmens in Aveyron, and also in Portugal, Iceland and the Balearic Islands. In 1867 he was the supervisor of the prehistory section at a world's fair in Paris. Two years later, he became the chief editor of the revue Mat√©riaux pour l'histoire naturelle et primitive de l'homme founded by Gabriel de Mortillet. This position he held until 1887. From 1882 he taught at the university in Toulouse and in 1897 he was elected a curator of Acad√©mie des Jeux floraux. After changing his opinion about Altamira, he became one of the founders of the studies of the cave art and one of the scientists (together with e. g. Henri Breuil) who recognised its importance. With Breuil he made the initial survey of the Caves of Gargas at Aventignan in the Pyrenees, and where F√©lix R√©gnault discovered Gravettian cave art in 1906. He was (together with Breuill and Marcellin Boule) one of the founders of Institut de pal√©ontologie humaine in Paris (following a generous donation from Albert I).  Cartailhac and Altamira  A bison in Altamira When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola's daughter Mar√≠a discovered the paintings in Altamira and Sautuola, together with professor Vilanova, published their findings in 1880, Cartailhac was one of the leaders of the scientists who, suddenly facing a revolutionary change in the view of the prehistoric man, ridiculed these paintings at the 1880 Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon. Due to this opinion, the members of the congress did not even visit Altamira. He changed his mind after several other caves with clearly prehistoric paintings had been found and visited the cave with Breuill in 1902. He apologised there to Mar√≠a de Sautuola (her father died in 1888) and promised her to do everything to clear don Marcelino's name (Sautuola had even been accused of forgery). His letter from 9 October 1902 says among other things: \\"We live in a new world\\". He also wrote a famous article, Mea culpa d'un sceptique in which he admitted he was deeply wrong, emphasized the importance of Altamira, accused himself of holding back the progress of his science, and harshly criticised himself for doing an injustice to an honest man and rejecting a thing without any investigation. Today, opinions about this article vary. Kleibl praises it as \\"one of the finest moments of prehistory\\" and a \\"brave article, showing no fear of hurting his\\" [Cartailhac's] \\"professional credit\\",Kleibl, Josef: Cesta za Adamem, Praha 1978 while Lewis-Williams writes about it as an opportunist thing used calculatingly for Cartailhac's own benefit when his position was no longer tenable.Lewis-Williams, David: The Mind in the Cave, London 2002 Cartailhac died in Geneva, aged 76.

In early 2000, representatives of the LBA claimed that many Buddhist women were taken forcibly from their home villages and forced to convert to Islam, and accused the state government in Jammu and Kashmir of allowing this to happen.Tundup Tsering and Tsewang Nurboo, in: Ladakh visited, Pioneer, 4/12/1995.Conversions: LBA blames govt The Tribune Online edition, 12 January 2000  Controversy  Observers have noted that the LBA has been allying with the RSS, BJP, and other right-wing Hindu nationalist groups with a pronounced anti-Christian and Islamophobic bias since the 1990's. Martijn van Beek has considered the rhetoric of the LBA and its leader to have grown more communal and \\"saffronised\\" in part because of the role Ladakh plays in the Kashmir conflict and the LBA's advocacy for the autonomy of Ladakh. Beek summarized the situation as such: \\"Thus, while the LBA and some Buddhist political leaders may be willing to share a platform with the sangh parivar to promote their agenda for Union Territory status, Hindutva as such would not appear to have much appeal in a region like Ladakh. Yet despite this limited appeal of Hindutva, the saffronization of education, of the media, and of public life in general are likely to strengthen even further the perceived validity and necessity of communal idioms\\".Beek, Martijn van (2011). Hindu Nationalism and Buddhist Radicalism in Ladakh. Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. The LBA has spread anti-Muslim information and conspiracies. The LBA has demonized the Ladakhi Muslims as untrustworthy and extremist for political leverage. The LBA promoted the \\"Turtok incident\\" where 24 young Kargili Muslims were arrested for harboring weapons in their village near the Line of Control in 1999 as an example to not trust the Muslims. The Kargili Muslims were cleared of all charges in 2001 and it was proven that local police fabricated the evidence.The LBA and other local media didn't give this aftermath any coverage. The LBA has also claimed a Muslim takeover of Ladakh where the Buddhists will be outnumbered by the Muslims in the near future. The LBA has claimed that the Ladakhi Muslims are luring Buddhist women to marry them and forcing them to convert to Islam in which the case of Stanzin Saldon marrying a Muslim man is set as an example. Saldon herself responded to these claims by stating \\"The statement of LBA is false and concocted, an effort to suppress and threaten the rights of individual.\\" Local politicians and Muslim organizations also expressed concern that the LBA is trying to disturb communal harmony.
