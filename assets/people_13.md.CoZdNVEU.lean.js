They are found throughout the Amazon Basin. Taxonomy Amazophrynella was separated from Dendrophryniscus in 2012 based on molecular genetic evidence that indicated deep divergence between an Amazonian and an Atlantic Forest clade, the latter retaining the name Dendrophryniscus whereas the former was described as a new genus Amazonella, later amended to Amazophrynella because of homonymy. The analysis suggested that Amazophrynella is the sister taxon of Dendrophryniscus, but a later study has suggested a more distant relationship. Description Amazophrynella are small toads measuring in snout–vent length. The hind limbs are well developed. The parotoid glands are absent, as are vocal slits and tympana. The skin is uniformly and finely granulose. Dorsal coloration is cryptic.

Fish carcasses were reported to have washed up on the beaches of Hà Tĩnh province from at least 6 April 2016. Later, a large number of dead fish were found on the coast of Hà Tĩnh and three other provinces (Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị and Thừa Thiên–Huế) until 18 April 2016. Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, a steel plant built by the Taiwanese corporation Formosa Plastics, discharged toxic industrial waste illegally into the ocean through drainage pipes. After denying responsibility for months, Formosa accepted responsibility for the fish deaths on 30 June 2016. The massive marine life destruction led to a number of protests by Vietnamese citizens in some cities on 1 May 2016, calling for a cleaner environment and demanding transparency in the investigation process.  Causes  The Formosa steel plant is suspected to be the source of the toxic chemical waste. The company admitted that there was a sewage pipe connecting the plant and the ocean and it was reported that several days before the incident, of chemicals were imported by Formosa in order to clean the pipe. Formosa was later ordered by Vietnamese authorities to remove those sewage pipes. However, the Vietnamese government denied that the Formosa steel plant was linked to the disaster. Vietnamese scientists largely agreed that the source of toxins was from the Vũng Áng Economic Zone, in which the Formosa steel plant was located; meanwhile, the Vietnamese government was accused of concealing the findings from the public. In a press conference held on 27 April, Võ Tuấn Nhân, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, claimed that the two main suspects of the marine life destruction were red tide and toxins generated by people. However, the red tide explanation was quickly rejected by the Vietnamese Fisheries Society. At 5:00 PM on 30 June 2016, the Government Office held a press conference to announce the causes and perpetrators of this particularly serious environmental disaster. Accordingly, the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry and other relevant units have checked and discovered violations regarding Formosa discharging toxic waste into the sea waste water containing toxins exceeding the permitted level. Based on the ground-level investigation, \\"the Vietnamese authorities along with the participation of scientists had concluded that Formosa was responsible for this environment pollution that led to marine life disaster.\\"  Effects and responses  Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, claimed that the massive marine life destruction was “the most serious environmental disaster Vietnam has ever faced”. By 29 April, approximately of fish carcasses had been washed up to the shores of four central provinces of Vietnam from Hà Tĩnh to Thừa Thiên–Huế. On 6 May, the amount of collected fish carcasses surpassed . The disaster disrupted the livelihood of fishermen in four provinces in the central coast of Vietnam. On 4 May 2016, Vietnamese government had announced a ban of processing and selling seafood caught within 20 nautical miles of central Vietnam provinces, just one day after the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment had claimed that the seafood in the region met safety standards. According to the local government of Quảng Bình, the fishermen of this province had already lost $5.2 million; in addition, the disaster also heavily impacted the tourism industry as nearly 30% tourists cancelled their planned tours to the affected provinces for the national holiday season starting on 30 April.  Protests  On 5 March 2017, protesters gathered on Nguyễn Du Street and in front of the Ho Chi Minh City post office. Police tried to disperse the protesters. Overseas Vietnamese also joined in protest around the world, demanding greater action about Formosa and protesting police abuse of protesters.  Government response  The Vietnamese government has cracked down on protests, including arresting Nguyễn Văn Hoá, a journalist who covered the Formosa protests. He was charged for \\"conducting propaganda against the state\\" under Article 88 of the Vietnamese Penal Code and sentenced to seven years prison. Lê Đình Lượng, another citizen journalist, was arrested for \\"activities attempting to overthrow the state\\" in July 2017.

Its origins may be traced to a Roman castrum. The present site was built in the late 14th century as a symbol of sovereignty and outpost of the archbishops of Cologne against the County of Jülich. Razed by French troops at the end of the 17th century, the ruins of the lowland castle ended up in private hands. The Zülpich manufacturing family of Sieger opened a schnaps distillery in the castle until 1870 that operated until the 1980s. In the Second World War it was badly damaged, was partly rebuilt in the 1950s and acts today as a tourist information bureau and home of the Zülpich History Society.  Description  Zülpich Castle is a modest brick building with an almost rectangular plan with high towers at the corners. It is one of the classic quadrangular castles of a type ideal for the Late Middle Ages. Its austere-looking defences are almost entirely devoid of architectural features and underline its fortress-like character which befits its location at the southwestern corner of the medieval town of Zülpich and its incorporation into the town's fortifications. The castle gate in the late 19th century The enclosed quadrangular structure was originally surrounded by a moat up to twelve metres wide. At its southern, western and eastern corners are round towers that were all once four storeys high. The southern one was reduced to two storeys high in the 19th century as it had fallen into disrepair. In the north and at right angles is a square tower measuring 10×10 metres with corner ashlars that is the only survivor of an older castle. Its shape clearly shows that it was given its present appearance in the 17th century. The two full- height round towers are topped by protruding, open fighting platforms with brick battlements. The corbels also use trachyte as a material, while the ogival arched frieze above is made of tuff. All the round corner towers once had residential rooms with fireplaces and garderobes. In the walls, which are up to three metres thick are spiral staircases. The western tower facing the town also acted as a dungeon. The four wings were formerly two-storey residential ranges with high basement vaults. Today only the thick outside walls have survived; these served a dual purpose as defensive walls with projecting chemins de ronde. The remaining structure of the present-day wing dates to a later period because the original roofs and interior walls from the 17th century have not survived. The external façade of the southwest wall is divided into regular axes by high, narrow, Gothic rectangular windows with lighter cut stone frames that are only interrupted by two garerobes. The best preserved exterior wall is on the southeast side with the main gate made from carefully cut bunter sandstone ashlars to which the drawbridge used to lead. Witnesses thereof are a deep, blind niche, which frames the ogival arch of the gateway and used to house the drawbridge, and the still visible roller holes for the chains. Above the portal are two, angled coats of arms whose details were probably destroyed by French soldiers in 1794. They used to depict the arms of Frederick of Saarwerden and probably the Archbishopric of Cologne. In addition there is another drawbridge on the southwest side, which gave access to the castle without having to enter the town. For the support musste. Für die buttresses of this bridge, building material from Jülich Palace was used, a building that had stood on the same spot since 1350.  References  P.

A wide interruption in the French fortifications was left between Épinal and Toul, known as the Trouée de Charmes (Charmes Gap), which was west of Nancy, about from the Franco-German frontier. A second series of fortifications, to prevent the main line being outflanked, was built in the south from Langres to Dijon and in the north from La Fère to Rheims, then from Valenciennes to Maubeuge, although for financial reasons these took until 1914 to complete. Prelude The French had suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Lorraine and were retreating in disorder. The situation left Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, the Chief of the General Staff of the German army, with a difficult choice. The apparent collapse of the French Second Army made possible a breakthrough at the Trouée de Charmes and the encirclement of all French troops in Lorraine and the Ardennes. Moltke decided to pursue the French and to break through the trouée. He maintained the left wing at its full strength of 26 divisions and ordered the Bavarian 6th Army (General Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria) to attack at the junction of the French Second and First armies (General Auguste Dubail). Castelnau, whose Second Army was regrouping in the Trouée de Charmes area, learned from the Deuxième Bureau (military intelligence), that German columns were moving to Saffais and Bechamps and heading for the gap and a few hours later French aerial observers spotted the German troops. Joseph Joffre, the French Commander in Chief, directed General Dubail to reinforce the Second Army with the VIII Corps.  Battle  On 24 August, the Bavarian 6th Army began to attack in the direction of the \\"Trouée de Charmes\\" against the centre of the Second Army, as this was judged to be where the French were the strongest. Initially the Germans were successful and managed to take Damelevières and Gerbéviller, then pushed the French from Vacquenat Wood, Clairlieu and Censal, from where they moved towards Bayon. The Second Army was able to limit the German advance, the French 74th Infantry Regiment in particular, fighting with great tenacity and Bavarian attacks on the Flainval plateau were repulsed. To force through the gap, the 6th Army moved troops to the centre from the flanks, which Castelnau exploited by attacking the German flanks with the 71st Division (General Émile Fayolle) and they were pushed out of Erbeviller, Réméréville and Courbesseaux. The right wing of the Second Army attacked Rupprecht's left flank and managed to take Saint-Boingt, Essey-la-Côte, Clézentaine and Ménarmont. During the night of the French continued a bombardment and Castelnau concentrated the Second Army against the centre of the 6th Army and launched an early morning attack to take Rozelieures, the attack succeeded but the Germans counter- attacked and retook Rozelieures. Castelnau now again attacked both German flanks with the XV Corps and XVI Corps. This had a devastating effect on the morale of the Bavarians, who had expected to be in pursuit of a defeated enemy. The Bavarian centre was kept under constant artillery fire by the French, and at the French regained Rozelieures from the 6th Army, which suffered casualties of 2,500 men killed; on 26 August, Rupprecht ordered a retreat.  Aftermath  The Battle of the Trouée de Charmes was a victory for the French Second Army; in stopping the Germans from passing through the Trouée de Charmes, Castelnau possibly saved the French from disaster, The two sides regrouped and on 4 September, fought the Battle of Grand Couronné when the Germans tried to capture Nancy but they had to abandon their effort on 13 September; the front line in Lorraine remained quiet for the next four years.

Both countries had ongoing border disputes throughout most of the 1960s, although often resolved and restrained within the history of Arab solidarity. Since 1967 and during 1973, despite the unstable history between the Kuwaiti and the leadership of Iraq back then, the Kuwaiti military acted in alliance with the Iraqi military during the Six-Day War and participated with a token force during the 1973 October War of the same year. 1973 border skirmish Known and designated as \\"Samita\\" (Arabic meaning: \\"quiet\\") skirmish; however, the proper border post in reference was \\"Sanita\\" as it referred to a northern border area post on the Kuwaiti border with Iraq and accordingly the skirmish was designated as such. On December 26, 1972, Kuwait sent a delegation of members of the National Assembly of Kuwait to Iraq. The Kuwaiti delegation met with Saddam Hussein, then deputy President of Iraq, and discussed the border demarcation between Kuwait and Iraq and the need to resolve this conflict. The Kuwaiti delegation also met with Iraqi President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, who assured members of the delegation that the border situation would be resolved. Accordingly, on February 26, 1973, another Kuwaiti delegation headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, then Kuwait's Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited Iraq and remained until March 2, 1973. Kuwaiti and Iraqi authorities conducted several meetings in which Iraqi authorities claimed that Warbah Island and Bubiyan Island were part of Iraq due to their importance as major water channels for the trade of Iraq and significant geopolitical strategic points. In response, the visiting delegation stated that Kuwait would not cede any of its territories and if the territories were needed for joint economic development purposes, then Kuwait would spare no effort in realizing such an endeavor advancing exclusively humanitarianism through a concession from the Emir of Kuwait within the formalization of a just mission approach and that following the finalization of border demarcations. As the Kuwaiti delegation was set to leave Iraq on March 3, 1973, the Iraqi government proposed an agreement between Kuwait and Iraq which would enhance the capabilities of Iraq in expanding trade through Kuwait. The Kuwaiti delegation was willing to cooperate as long as its territories were not compromised unjustifiably. In response, the government of Iraq and the leadership at the time withdrew their proposal and started applying pressure. In the meantime and due to the history of restrained and calm disputes, Kuwait border posts were rotated between soldiers of the Kuwait Armed Forces and the Kuwait Police. On March 20, 1973, at 0300, a crisis occurred between Kuwait and Iraq based on land demarcations that Iraq was claiming. Units of the Iraqi military advanced to a Kuwaiti border police station, secured by members of the Kuwait border guards, and asked the border guards to vacate the premises. When the officer in charge refused, Iraqi forces heavily combat engaged the lightly guarded border post. The border guards troops held their ground and battled the heavily armed Iraqi force throughout the night and morning. The skirmish wounded several and claimed the lives of the first lieutenant in charge and his corporal. As a result, Kuwait declared a state of emergency, and the borders were sealed. Immediately after, Mubarak Abdullah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and his deputy Brigadier General Sheikh Saleh Mohammed Al-Sabah mobilized the Kuwait Armed Forces and led the deployment towards the border with Iraq in preparation for the worst. The Kuwaiti combat quick reaction force contingent was led by a Kuwaiti colonel assisted by a lieutenant-colonel, consisting of elements of the Kuwait Army and the Kuwait Air Force. The combat reaction force included a Commando force led by a Kuwaiti lieutenant colonel being combat supported by an armored tank brigade and two supersonic English Electric Lightning fighter aircraft who were tasked with engaging the area of conflict as required and remain acting as armed air vanguards patrollers and monitor for the area from Umm Qasr in the east to Safwan in the west. In response to the assembling of the Kuwait Armed Forces by Mubarak and Saleh, the Iraqi authorities issued a statement at 1300 on March 20, 1973, claiming that the Kuwaiti forces were the aggressors, which were intruding in Iraqi territory while Iraqi military units were conducting military drills and as a result, the Iraqi military responded with force. In response, Kuwait authorities issued a similar statement claiming that the assault on the \\"Sanita\\" post was an assault of Kuwaiti territory and subsequently an assault on Kuwait. In addition, the Kuwaiti statement added that the assault occurred during the time when Kuwait was expecting an Iraqi delegation from Iraq to come to Kuwait and settle the demarcation of borders between the two countries, based on the agreement that Baghdad signed on October 4, 1963. The Iraqi government proposed that the Iraqi Military and the Military of Kuwait should pull back 10 km from the assaulted post. Accordingly, Kuwaiti authorities refused this proposition and requested the Arab League to demand from Iraq to pull back their forces to the demarcation line set by the Arab League Forces during Operation Vantage. Also, Kuwaiti authorities insisted on the withdrawal of all Iraqi military units from the \\"Sanita\\" border post and also demanded to settle the demarcation of borders between Kuwait and Iraq. Consequently, the border dispute was shaping to be governed by a political resolution.

After the Second World War, she became increasingly marginalised from the political mainstream because of her opposition to rearmament. Life =Provenance and early years= Rosa Aschenbrenner was born into a Roman Catholic family at Beilngries, a small town a short distance to the north of Ingolstadt in Upper Bavaria. She was the eldest of her parents' eight recorded children. Her father was a clock maker who also kept an agricultural smallholding. He was also chairman of the local Catholic Workers' Association, and Rosa Aschenbrenner grew up as a Roman Catholic, though by the end of her political career, slightly unusually for Bavaria in those times, she would be describing herself as \\"without religion\\" (\\"konfessionslos\\"). From 1898 she was in domestic service. In 1908 she joined the \\"Women's and girls' Education League\\" (\\"Frauen- und Mädchenbildungs- Verein\\") in Munich. She married Hans Aschenbrenner the next year and joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1908 or 1909. She worked as a hairdresser between 1909 and 1914. During the next few years she took work as a seamstress with the army clothing supply department and in slaughter houses and stock yards. It was in 1914 that she joined the SPD \\"Women workers Committee\\" \\"Arbeiterinnenausschuss\\"). When First World War broke out in 1914, many in the SPD leadership came out in support for the government position, but in 1917 the party split, primarily over differences as to whether or not to continue supporting the war. Rosa Aschenbrenner chose the break-away party, which was launched that year as the Independent Social Democratic Party (Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands / USPD). She quickly became a USPD left-wing activist. =Democratic politics= Aschenbrenner was briefly arrested in 1919. On 7 July 1920 she was elected deputy chair of the Munich district USPD leadership. She had already been selected and elected as a USPD member to the newly democratic Bavarian Regional Legislature (\\"Bayerischer Landtag\\") on 6 June 1920. During the course of the further re-alignment of left wing politics that followed the German Revolution of 1918–19 she participated at the \\"unification party conference\\" in December 1920 at which the larger part of the USPD united with the newly emerging Communist Party (\\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands\\" / KPD). Later, in 1921, attended the 6th Party Conference of the Communist Party at Jena. After 22 December 1920 Aschenbrenner is listed as a Landtag member not for the USPD, but for the Communist Party. A member of the party's regional district leadership (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for South Bavaria from 1921, she took responsibility for women's issues. After 1925, and till she left the regional party leadership team in 1929, she served as the regional party treasurer. In November 1921, however, she suffered a health crisis when she had to undergo a debilitating operation. She left the Landtag on 7 December 1921, formally resigning her mandate on 22 January 1922. She recovered and returned to the political fray, but for the next few years her focus switched to welfare and support work with the \\"Frauenhilfe für politische Gefangene\\" organisation which had been created during a period of political repression in the revolutionary aftermath of the war, as a left-wing vehicle for women to provide support to political prisoners. The organisation had been set up by the ADGB (Trades Union Confederation), but during 1923 it was dissolved, primarily because of the overlap between its residual activities and those of the Rote Hilfe Deutschland (RHD - Communist welfare organisation): from around 1925 Aschenbrenner, like others affected, switched her energies over to the RHD. In 1924 there was another election to the Bavarian regional parliament. Aschenbrenner stood successfully as a candidate. This time she remained a member of the \\"Landtag\\" till 1932, though by that time she was no longer a member of the Communist Party. In 1928 the German Communist Party embarked on a period of internal feuding. Aschenbrenner belonged to the pragmatic non- ideological wing of the party whose leaders included August Thalheimer and Heinrich Brandler. Aschenbrenner and members of her faction were particularly critical of the policies advanced by the party leadership under Ernst Thälmann, which followed the so-called social fascism and revolutionary union opposition strategies being mandated from Moscow. In 1928 she received a formal \\"warning\\" against deviations from the party line. =Party split= In June 1929 Rosa Aschenbrenner announced her resignation from the Communist Party, and went on to denounced as politically catastrophic the party line being pursued by the leadership. The Communist Party leadership, which valued discipline and loyalty, expelled her husband from the party in July, after he rejected their instruction to divorce his wife. Aschenbrenner now, on 11 June 1929, joined the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition) / KPO) which had been coalescing round Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer since the end of the previous year. This led to her being pilloried by the Communist press as a \\"political corpse\\" (\\"politischer Leichnam\\"). She remained in the KPO for less than a year, however. In the northern part of Bavaria the KPO had been able to set up a regional power base in Nuremberg, centred around Karl Grönsfelder, but in the south of Bavaria, the region surrounding Munich, the KPO never really established itself, and in May 1930 Rosa Aschenbrenner rejoined the centre- left Social Democratic Party (SPD)) from which she had broken away in 1917. =Nazi years= The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. On 17 March 1933 Aschenbrenner was taken into \\"protective custody\\" (\\"Schutzhaft\\"). She was released after two or three months, but remained under police surveillance. She was arrested again in 1936 or 1937 for \\"Violation of the Treachery Law (\\"Verstoßes gegen das Heimtückegesetz\\"). Her crime had involved listening to forbidden foreign radio stations. On this occasion she was sentenced to a six- week or four-month jail term: sources differ on the duration of her second prison term, but there is agreement that she underwent two periods in jail between 1933 and 1945, covering several months. During the twelve Nazi years till 1945 Aschenbrenner supported herself with cleaning jobs. =After the war ended= The end of the war found Bavaria in the US occupation zone, which meant an end to one-party dictatorship and widespread consensus between occupiers and occupied on the need for a rapid return to democratic political systems and structures. Aschenbrenner was a founder member of the recreated SPD (party)). She was one of the 51 SPD members elected to the 180-person Bavarian Constitutional Assembly mandated to created a new constitution for Bavaria. During the later 1940s she may have returned briefly to sit in the Bavarian Regional Legislature (\\"Bayerischer Landtag\\"), but sources, strangely, are not consistent on this. In any event, twelve years under Hitler had opened the way for an increasingly consensual approach to politics. Aschenbrenner's own experiences had left her with an increasingly powerful commitment to pacifism, and by opposing the military rearmament that was being promoted by the United States, she found herself increasingly seen as a left-wing extremist and marginalised within the SPD. During the 1950s her political energies became concentrated on municipal politics, and she sat as an SPD city councillor in Munich till 1956. As a city councillor she sat on committees involved in reconstruction, social and civic matters, health and the Oktoberfest. Rosa Aschenbrenner died at Munich on 9 February 1967.

Description The erect, glabrous, spinescent and straggly shrub typically grows to a height of . The yellowish-green to reddish-brown branchlets are slightly flattened and have smooth thin brown coloured bark. The evergreen flat dull phyllodes have a rhomboid-orbicular shape and are up to in length and width and have one prominent major vein. It blooms between June and October forming yellow flowers. The simple axillary flower-spikes are usually solitary or occur in pairs and have large spherical deep golden-yellow flower-heads. Following flowering brown seed pods form that have an oblong shape and are around in length and wide. The pods are flat but raised over each seed. The hard shiny black-brown seeds have an ovoid shape and are about with a width of around . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1874 in the work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. It was reclassified as Racosperma strongylophyllum by Leslie Pedley in 1987 but was transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2001. The species name is taken from the Greek words strongylos meaning round and phyllon meaning a leaf referring to the shape of the leaves on the plant. A. strongylophylla is a part of the Acacia pyrifolia group but can be distinguished by the non-racemose inflorescences. Distribution It is native to arid desert areas in the north western South Australia, southern Northern Territory and the north eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia. It is found along watercourses, on rocky hillsides and valley floors and walls growing in shallow red sandy soils. It is usually a part of tall shrubland communities with other Acacia and Eucalyptus species.

After first working as a teacher, she took up photography in the mid-1890s to satisfy her artistic ambitions. She is remembered for the portraits and landscapes she took while working in Skagen Early years and education Born on 9 November 1859 in Ugilt near Hjørring, Classen was the daughter of the forester Henrich Wilhelm Claussen and his wife Ane Hedevig Cortsen. She grew up near the village of Børglum between Hjørring and Frederikshavn as her father worked on the Børglum Abbey estate. Claussen showed an early interest in art, sketching scenes of the surrounding countryside from the age of eight. After her father died when she was 14, she was inspired to start writing poetry in a collection she titled Gisninger (Conjectures) in which she documented her religious and existential ideas. She completed her education at a teachers training college for women in Copenhagen. Career In the mid-1880s, she opened a school in Frederikshavn but soon afterwards went to Vienna to study painting. In her late twenties, she became interested in hypnotism and spiritism. As a result, she published a number of religious works including Mit Livssyn (My Outlook on Life, 1905) and En ny Reformation (A New Reformation, 1925). On returning from Vienna, she worked as a photographer in Aarhus for a short period but then went to Norway to study parapsychology. In the mid-1890s, she returned to Denmark where she turned to photography, opening first a studio in Brønderslev and then from 1897 in Skagen where she took portraits of both the town's residents and its summer visitors. She also took a number of landscape photographs of Skagen and the surroundings, demonstrating her artistic talents. Working in a remote corner of Denmark, she also carried out the technical processing work as well as framing. Claussen worked full-time as a photographer until 1929 when she retired to Frederikshavn where she lived in a house on the coast. She died there on 4 January 1950.

An element x of a group G is called strongly real if there is an involution t with x^t = x^{-1}. An element x of a group G is real if and only if for all representations \\\\rho of G, the trace \\\\mathrm{Tr}(\\\\rho(g)) of the corresponding matrix is a real number. In other words, an element x of a group G is real if and only if \\\\chi(x) is a real number for all characters \\\\chi of G. A group with every element real is called an ambivalent group. Every ambivalent group has a real character table. The symmetric group S_n of any degree n is ambivalent.  Properties  A group with real elements other than the identity element necessarily is of even order. For a real element x of a group G, the number of group elements g with x^g = x^{-1} is equal to \\\\leftC_G(x)\\\\right, where C_G(x) is the centralizer of x, :\\\\mathrm{C}_G(x) = \\\\\\\\{ g \\\\in G\\\\mid x^g = x \\\\\\\\}. Every involution is strongly real. Furthermore, every element that is the product of two involutions is strongly real. Conversely, every strongly real element is the product of two involutions. If and x is real in G and \\\\leftC_G(x)\\\\right is odd, then x is strongly real in G.  Extended centralizer  The extended centralizer of an element x of a group G is defined as :\\\\mathrm{C}^*_G(x) = \\\\\\\\{ g \\\\in G\\\\mid x^g = x \\\\lor x^g = x^{-1} \\\\\\\\}, making the extended centralizer of an element x equal to the normalizer of the set The extended centralizer of an element of a group G is always a subgroup of G. For involutions or non-real elements, centralizer and extended centralizer are equal.

It was first described in 1925 by the American zoologist Edmund Beecher Wilson, the type locality being North Sulawesi. He gave it the name Gelliodes fibrosa, a name already used in 1905 for a species in the Gulf of Mannar, Sri Lanka. In 2013, Carballo, Aquilar-Camacho, Knapp & Bell, decided that this was a homonym, a separate taxon from the original one given that name, and gave the new species the name Gelliodes wilsoni. Description Gelliodes wilsoni varies somewhat in growth form but is usually found as a thick encrusting mat with irregular branches that overgrow each other, sometimes joining together, and sometimes forming short erect branches. It is usually bluish-grey, with a beige-grey interior. The texture is spongy but fibrous, elastic and tough and the surface may be smooth or may have irregular tufts of fibres protruding. Distribution and habitat G. wilsoni was originally known from the Philippines. It has spread to Hawaii as an invasive species, where it is now present on Oahu, Kauai, and Maui; original introduction may have been on the hull of a floating dry dock. In the Hawaiian Islands it is mainly present as part of the fouling community on piers, harbour structures and floating docks. In Kaneohe Bay and other locations, it is present on patch reefs, and may encrust the shaded lower surfaces of plate corals. Specimens of a sponge presumed to be identical to G. wilsoni have been found in other locations across the Pacific Ocean; these include Guam in the western Pacific, Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific, and Acapulco Bay and the Baja Peninsula in the eastern Pacific. These sightings appear to be linked to international transport, as the reproductive ability of this sponge would only allow it to disperse locally.

However, the film was never released until its video on demand release on July 9, 2013. On film concept and idea, Oakley said, \\"I went to American Film Institute to the directing program and found it very restrictive. Although in hindsight, I probably should not have found it that way. I met my whole team there—the director of photography, the writer, the producer, the set designers—and we wanted to make a feature quickly out of the program. The writer had an idea that seemed interesting. So, we started putting it together.\\" Oakley describes Mildred Pierce as his inspiration behind the film. In 2013, Oakley co-wrote the screenplay for The Brits Are Coming with Alex Michaelides. On May 14, 2015, it was announced that Uma Thurman would star in the film, with Oakley directing.

Brailo was born into a merchant family from Prača in eastern Bosnia, the son of Mihoje and Vladija, and grandson of Radan. He had three younger brothers, Bogiša, Hval, and Vukosav. Brailo was first mentioned in a document dated to June 1392, then mentioned in February 1399 as a customs official (carinik) of count (knez) Pavle Radenović in Ledenice. In the following years he was a diplomat in the service of the Pavlović noble family. Brailo Tezalović, Bogdan Muržić and Brajko Hvaonić, all from Prača, were the biggest merchants in Bosnia of their time. The main article of commerce was lead, likely mostly from the mine of Olovo. The debts of individuals in Bosnia were different and ranged around 100 ducats, but sometimes could cross over 1000 ducats (merchants from Prača reaching the largest individual credits); Brailo, as the representative of another merchant from Prača (Brajko Hvaonić), raised the credit to 2965 ducats. In 1411, Brailo is mentioned as the protovestijar of Pavle for the first time. Only in 1413, Brailo sent 11,5 wagons of lead to the Republic of Ragusa. He was first mentioned with the title of knez on 31 July 1421, and was inscribed as a witness in the charters of the Pavlović in 1427, 1432 and 1433. His importance at the Pavlović court is evident from the fact that the Ragusans viewed him as an especially important person in the discussions over the sale of Konavle; when the sale was finalized, Brailo received 500 ducats and a parcel of land from Ragusa. He was mentioned as deceased on 28 January 1446. In ca. 1466, nine noblemen from Hum stated before the Ragusan government that they had \\"served and courted together with knez Brailo and his brother for lord vojvoda Pavle Radenović.

The seed for the film was sown when Chandra K. Jha, who went on to become one of the producers of the film, pitched his story idea to Samten Bhutia. In subsequent meetings between the two of them and Prabachan Shrestha, the screenwriter, the story took shape quickly and a full-fledged screenplay followed soon after. Even at this early stage, there was a unanimous opinion that the leading roles of Kriti and Suresh should be played by actors Priyanka Karki and Arpan Thapa, respectively. When the story was pitched to the actors, they immediately agreed to come on board. Story revolves around Suresh (Arpan Thapa) who is an amateur artist who is married to Kriti (Priyanka Karki), an outspoken and brash housewife. Together with their seven-year- old son Suvid (Rosin Subedi), they seem to lead a normal life. This normality includes arguments regarding the household finances and the separate, independent lives the couple lead. Things start to take a serious turn when Suresh discovers that Kriti is hiding things from him. Suresh’s best friend Jayant is of the belief that Kriti is untrustworthy and is most probably having an affair. When Kriti’s ex is brutally murdered, Jayant firmly believes that Kriti is involved in this crime. Though Suresh is not convinced of this initially, events start to unfold that firmly lead him to believe that the mother of his son is trying to kill him.

A practising lawyer himself, Gilbert made the setting of the novel a London solicitor's office. It was Gilbert's fourth novel and, like his three earlier ones, features Chief Inspector Hazlerigg. The novel was well-received and has regularly appeared in \\"Top 100\\" crime lists. Some critics consider it to be Gilbert's best work.  Plot  Horniman, Birley and Craine are a respectable firm of solicitors, of Lincoln's Inn, London. After the firm’s senior partner Abel Horniman dies, a large deed box in his office is opened to reveal a corpse. It belongs to Marcus Smallbone, who had been a co-trustee with Mr Horniman of the valuable Ichabod Trust. Chief Inspector Hazlerigg investigates with the help of Henry Bohun, a newly-qualified solicitor and employee of the firm. Bohan has a condition (called in the novel 'parainsomnia') that means he needs less than two hours sleep a night, giving him a great deal of time to help with the investigations. Suspicion falls initially on the recently-deceased partner, the theory being that Smallbone had been killed to prevent him from publicly denouncing Abel Horniman’s misuse of the Trust funds. Miss Cornel, who had been Mr Horniman’s devoted secretary for over 20 years, helps his solicitor son Bob Horniman take over the Ichabod Trust work. But when Miss Chittering, one of the secretaries, is strangled, suspicion switches to Bob himself, who is clearly lying about where he was on the day in question. Bohun realises that Bob Horniman is in love with another of the secretaries, Anne Mildmay. The pair had had a romantic liaison in the office on the day Miss Chittering was killed, and he lied about it to protect her. The true killer was Miss Cornel who, in an act of misguided loyalty to her ex-employer, had dispatched Smallbone to avoid Abel Hornman’s fraud coming to light; and when it appeared that Miss Chittering had information that would have implicated her, had killed her as well. Bob Horniman sells his newly-acquired share in the firm, marries Anne Mildmay, and takes up farming.  Principal characters  * Mr Marcus Smallbone (deceased) * Mr Abel Horniman, deceased senior partner and founder of the firm * Mr Tristram (‘Tubby’) Craine, partner * Mr Birley, partner * Bob Horniman, solicitor, son of Abel Horniman * Henry Bohun, newly- qualified solicitor and amateur investigator * Eric Duxford, solicitor * John Cove, trainee solicitor * Miss Elizabeth Cornel, previously secretary to Abel Horniman; then to Bob Horniman * Miss Anne Mildmay, secretary to Mr Craine * Miss Florrie Bellbas, secretary to Eric Duxford and John Cove * Miss Cissie Chittering, secretary to Mr Birley * Mrs Porter, secretary * Sergeant Cockerill, office clerk and housekeeper * Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, police investigator  Reception and critical appraisal  On the book's first appearance, Margery H Oates of the New York Times noted the \\"tense atmosphere\\" and called it \\"a first-rate job\\". \\"The author is a lawyer who looks at the law and the people in it with equal parts of mirth and wisdom\\". A later appraisal comes from the 1973 Catalogue of Crime by Barzun and Taylor who called the book \\"Gilbert's masterwork\\". They noted that the motives are 'good', and the detection by Inspector Hazlerigg and an amateur assistant 'excellent'. The two murders they considered to be 'splendid'. In a 1984 review, George N Dove noted that Smallbone Deceased is widely considered to be Gilbert's most successful novel. It has, he said, an air of bright originality along with the characteristically plausible atmosphere of a solicitor's firm, dry whimsical wit, and a serene atmosphere that is shattered by a sensational murder. There is an especially strong playful portrayal of the English lawyer's talent for solemn pomposity. The book is important in Gilbert's development as a transition toward the police procedural novel, a form in which he would later excel. In the Guardian's 2006 obituary of the author, HRF Keating described the novel as \\"a classic of the genre ... rich with everyday details of a law practice, both good and naughty, dancing too with pawky humour; at the same time it sets a puzzle to please the most exigent of readers\\". The Telegraph's obituary also praised it as \\"one of his finest novels\\". The novel has regularly appeared in 'Top 100' lists. In 1987 Keating featured the novel among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published, writing that the book \\"is in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of cunningly-suggested red herrings\\". In 1990 the book was included in the list of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time published by the British-based Crime Writers' Association, and in 1995 the Mystery Writers of America included it in their Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time. In The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books (2017) Martin Edwards wrote that Michael Gilbert had \\"exploited his knowledge of life in a solicitors’ practice to witty effect in one of the finest workplace-based detective novels\\". Edwards also wrote the introduction to the 2019 British Library reissue in which he said that the book \\"blends in masterly fashion an authentic setting, pleasingly differentiated characters, smoothly readable prose, and a clever puzzle\\". He opined that few British detective stories of the Fifties came close to matching it in quality.

It was created by decree on 6 February 2001 and is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. The conservation unit is in the municipality of Aiuaba in the state of Ceará. It is in the mid- north sedimentary basin in the Serra de Ibiapaba. The area is hilly in some areas, flatter in others. It reaches altitudes of above sea level. Average annual rainfall is , with most rain falling between December and June. The average temperature is . Vegetation is wooded or forested steppe savannah and has mostly not been altered by human action, apart from some fields. Many of the plants are adapted to drought. Bird life is limited due to the long dry periods. Conservation Aiuaba Ecological Station is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). The purpose is to conserve nature and support scientific research. The eared dove (Zenaida auriculata), which is threatened by professional hunters, seeks refuge in the unit during the breeding season. The unit is of great ecological importance as the largest Caatinga biome conservation area fully covered in Caatinga trees, and plays an important role in preserving biological diversity. In 2014 an environmentalist stated that the Aiuaba Ecological Station had been delivered to its fate. There had been no manager since December 2012, which was causing irreparable damage to the region's wildlife and savannah biome. Hunters were on a spree, killing birds and wild animals, as well as felling centuries-old native trees.\\" As of 2015 the Gameleira surveillance post had been closed for a year. The unit and its surroundings were threatened by local people who hunt and remove trees, although an environmental awareness program may be having some effect in reducing these activities.

Dolgorukiy was the Grand Prince (Velikiy Knyaz) of the Kievan Rus' (Kiev) and a member of the Rurik dynasty. On 6 June 1954, the statue was erected in Tverskaya Square (then called \\"Soviet Square\\"), located in front of the building of the Moscow Mayor (then, the \\"Mossovet\\"). The sculptors were Sergei Mikhailovich Orlov, A. P. Antropov, and Nicholay Lvovich Shtamm. The architectural design was by Viktor Semenovich Andreyev. The statue replaced the monument of the first Soviet Constitution that was broken down in 1941. Skobelev statue Inauguration of the General Mikhail Skobelev monument The Skobelev statue being dismantled Moscow City Hall, behind the Statue of Liberty Constitution Monument The original statue erected in 1912 in Tverskaya Square was of General Mikhail Skobelev, a hero of the Russian-Turkish War of 1877. Skobelev was shown mounted his horse. The monument was known as \\"The White General\\". Skobelev wore a white parade tunic and rode a white horse into battle. He was also a member of the Tsar's military force and therefore a \\"White\\". Following the October Revolution of 1917, a decree concerning monuments \\"erected in honour of tzars and their servants\\" was issued. It was part of Lenin's campaign of propaganda through monuments. Because of this decree, the Skobelev monument was removed. Constitution obelisk In 1918, the Skobelev monument was replaced by the Constitution obelisk.Title: Всегда и во всём быть художником. Publisher: Мир истории. Published in January, 2002. Accessdate: 2009-02-08. Language: Russian. The high, three-edged Constitution obelisk built in honour of the Soviet constitution, was erected in front of the Mossovet. In June 1919, the obelisk was joined by a Statue of Liberty. It was created by the sculptor, Nikolay Andreyevich Andreyev. Vera Alekseyeva, the niece of Konstantin Stanislavski, might have posed for this statue. Another possible model was the actress at МХАТ, Eugenie Khovanskaya, who was famous for her beauty. The sculptor was inspired by the dynamic forms of classical Greek statues such as Nike of Samothrace. The Constitution obelisk did not stand for long. By the end of the 1930s, it required complete restoration. It had been hastily and cheaply made from low grade materials; the obelisk was built in brick and plastered \\"like granite\\". The statue was cast in concrete. On 22 April 1941, before it could be restored, the monument was blown up and removed. The head of the Statue of Liberty survived and was placed in the Tretyakov Gallery Creation of the statue A settlement had existed at the site of Moscow at least 200 years prior to its official founding in 1147 by Yuriy Dolgorukiy. However, the 800th anniversary of Moscow celebrations in September 1947 accepted the traditional date. This first large, post-war celebration, shortly preceded the 30th anniversary celebrations of the October Revolution. In 1946, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin sent the archaeologist and anthropologist Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov (1907 1970) from Kiev to find remains of Yuriy Dolgoruky. This was so that a ceremonious reburial of Dolgoruky could take place during the celebrations. No remains were found at Dolgoruky's grave. In September 1946, a competition to design the Dolgorukiy monument was held. The sculptor S.M. Orlov won the competition and was awarded the Stalin Prize for his work. The Russian writer, journalist, and historian Alexander Anatoliyevich Vas'kin said that Stalin selected Orlov's entry from amongst the other entries because it was praised by the American ambassador W. Averell Harriman (1891 1986) during a Moscow Kremlin reception.Author: Васькин, Александр. Title: Тверская улица в домах и лицах. Published by Центрполиграф, Moscow, date 2015. Total pages: 236. On 6 September, 1947, the groundbreaking ceremony for the monument took place during the celebrations. However, the monument took some time to build. Disagreements took place between the three artists. The scale of Orlov's design and technique's were questioned. His usual small sculpture techniques might not have worked on a monumental work. Orlov also clashed with authorities. He opposed to the text on the monument dedication, reading, \\"To the founder of Moscow from the Soviet government\\". (The Soviet government is not mentioned on the monument.) Insufficient funding also affected the speed of work. Moscow's anniversary marked the simultaneous launches of several large-scale projects all of which required special funding. These included the building of the \\"Stalin skyscrapers\\". A possibly apocryphal story tells of Stalin's approval of the final version of the monument. He carefully considered the model and said, \\"Why do you, Comrade Orlov, have Dolgorukiy sit on the mare? A stallion can accentuate the masculinity of the founder of Moscow\\". Changes were introduced to the project immediately. The sculpture was produced by the \\"Mytishchi Plant in honour of the national artist E. F. Belashova\\". The production was supervised by the sculptor and bronze caster Savinsky Gabriel Ivanovich. It cost 5.5 million roubles paid by the city of Moscow. The grand opening of the monument took place on 6 June, 1954. Reception Reactions were mixed to the building of the Dolgorukiy monument. The monument did not reflect the ideology of the Communist Party.

From 1910 the publication was transferred to a special printing house in Saida, South Lebanon.

Instead of spreading progress and enlightenment, other current and political topics became predominant. After the independence of Lebanon in 1943 the thematic focus was more and more on the rights of Shiites in Lebanon. Az-Zain's son Nizar took over the management of the journal after his father's death in 1960, which now published mainly literature topics.

The building is situated in the Artillery Passage, and was merged with the now Grade II listed building 58 Artillery Lane after the Second World War; their combined shop front is one of the oldest in London, and the combined building is used by Raven Row as a free art exhibition centre. History It is not known exactly when the first house at 56 Artillery Lane was built, although a house appears at the location on a map of 1677. The original name of the building was 3 Raven Row. During the early 18th century, deed documents show that the building was owned by a mercer named Mathew Hebart and later a weaver named Thomas Wilkes. The building was rebuilt between 1750 and 1756, in order to accommodate Huguenot silk merchants Nicholas Jourdain and Francis Rybot who wanted to use the building as a silk shop; it is believed that Sir Robert Taylor was the architect. The 1756 building, including its shop front, still exists today, making it one of the oldest shop fronts in London. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the building was used as a grocery shop. After the Second World War, 56 and 58 Artillery Lane were merged into a single office building, and 56 Artillery Lane became a Grade I listed building in 1950. In 1972, the building was refurbished after a major fire. In 2006, an excavation of 56 and 58 Artillery Lane took place, and the buildings were later sold to Alex Sainsbury, heir to the Sainsbury's food chain, who converted them into the Raven Row free art exhibition space.

He founded the Richmond N.S. (for Nathan System) Brewing Co. LtdHistory of the Richmond N.S. Brewing Company Nathan Institute, 1926 - 1965History of the Nathan System in Australia Australian Brewing News, 29 July 2013 (Carlton & United Breweries) in Melbourne Australia. He is responsible for both the introduction of pasteurisation to Australia's dairy industry and the introduction of the Swiss Nathan System of brewing to Australia.The Amber Nectar: A Celebration of Beer and Brewing in Australia, Keith Dunstan Viking O'Neil, 1987 \\"National Library of Australia\\" He was the youngest of five children. Early life and background Grant Hay was born in Bright, Victoria, the son of James Grant Hay, partner of Melbourne shipping firm, Coulson Hay & Co. and Catherine Margaret (née Cox), daughter of Irish distillery founder, Charles Cox. The Grant Hay's owned hop farm estates in Bright, Victoria and the Derwent Valley in Tasmania and were the main supplier of hops to Carlton & United Breweries in Victoria. =United States & England= Upon the death of his father in 1914, Grant Hay traveled to America by steamship to San Francisco on board the USS American, meeting Tooheys Brewery manager Arnold Resch. The two agreed to inspect the major American breweries of Milwaukee, including the Valentin Blatz Brewing Company, Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, and the Miller Brewing Company and Anheuser-Busch brewing company in St Louis. Grant Hay then sailed to London to inspect the Courage Brewery plant and its hotels. =Switzerland & Germany= He then flew to Zurich and met with Dr Leopold Nathan, a Swiss chemist, who had invented a new brewing system. Grant Hay drove to Munich and attended Oktoberfest in the company of the Reinheitsgebot before the outbreak of war and returned to Australia. =Australia= In 1918 he married Margaret Glover, cousin of Australian landscape artist John Glover. Grant Hay was forty. They had four children, Patricia, Kathleen, Alison and Peter. The Grant Hay's settled at Sackville Street, Kew and later moved to 'Egoline' at Albany Road in Toorak, Victoria. The family also owned 'Kilby Park,'a one hundred acre dairy farm and thoroughbred racehorse stud at Kew, Victoria. By age fifty Grant Hay was already one of Victoria's wealthiest hop merchants when the Victorian beer wars began in 1925. Carlton & United Breweries had grown into Australia's largest brewer and began to use monopolistic practices of lowering the cost of supply to hop growers, including Grant Hay's 'Kentdale' hops from the Derwent Valley. Richmond N.S. Brewing Co. =Hop Merchants= The Kentdale Hop Estate was one of the finest properties in Tasmania. It was located fifty kilometres from Hobart and harvested thirty hectares of finest- quality hops. In 1927 a business disagreement took place between Grant Hay and Carlton & United Breweries over the price and quantity of hops, causing Carlton to cancel its contract with Kentdale. Resentful of Carlton's unfair business practices, Grant Hay proceeded to off-load his hops successfully to Carlton's interstate rival, Tooheys. He then summoned a meeting of his hop estate managers from Bright in Victoria and the Derwent Valley in Tasmania for a meeting at Coulson Hay & Co. headquarters in Melbourne to establish his own brewery. =Zurich, Prohibition & Chicago= On 4 April 1927, Grant Hay wired a cable to Dr Nathan Leopold in Zurich, Switzerland for the order of the first Swiss Nathan Brewing System to be shipped to Melbourne and to be accompanied by Master Swiss Brewer, Heinrich Walter Haenggi of Zurich. Over the course of three months, Grant Hay proceeded to buy up five industrial sites adjoining his Church Street property. He then ordered a consignment of three thousand units of purified gin to be shipped from British Army headquarters in Lahore and resold the rebottled gin to American bootleggers in prohibition controlled Chicago, netting Coulson Hay & Co. a million pounds. The deal set Grant Hay up for life, and bankrolled the construction of the brewery. =Construction & Law= On 13 August 1927, Grant Hay's application for permit to build a brewery on the site at Church Street Richmond was approved by the Richmond City Council. Grant Hay then hired contractors to excavate the site in preparation of the brewery's construction, when the excavation was delayed, Grant Hay proceeded to dynamite the site himself using three tonnes of dynamite. On the morning of 23 August 1927, the sound of percussion could be heard as far away as Brighton, and was said to have woken the Mayor of Melbourne from his sleep. When nearby Richmond residents objected, Grant Hay sued the residents and offered to buy their homes. Eventually, council sided with the residents and sought an injunction against Grant Hay to the detonation, but Grant Hay won on appeal and continued unabated. Mr Grant Hay retained Brigadier Sir Eugene Gorman as his full-time barrister and confidant. Litigous by nature, Grant Hay later sued the Camberwell City Council on its liquor licensing trading laws on appeal before the Privy Council, UK. Mr Gorman's rooms in the Equity Chambers building on Melbourne's Bourke Street are named Gorman Chambers in his honour.Two new chambers to open in Victoria , Lawyers Weekly, 26 July 2010. =Nathan System= On 24 October 1927, Heinrich Walter Haenggi and his wife arrived at Port Melbourne aboard the SS Modolva bringing with them the single largest steel works consignment for disembarkation. Three transports were used to unload and deliver the Swiss brewing plant machinery and equipment to Church Street. Mr Grant Hay drove the Haenggi's to their hotel in his new 1927 Packard Roadster and held a dinner in honour of their arrival at his home. By Easter of 1928, the construction of the Richmond Brewery was completed and a toast was held on the assembly line by Mrs Grant Hay and included two hundred guests, from growers, hoteliers and workers. The brewery began its first run of Richmond Lager and Bitter Beer on 24 April 1928 with 88 dozen bottles of output per week which continued to grow to 200 dozen bottles of output per week by 1929. The quality of the beer, and the fact that it had been produced free of any combine commended the beverage to the public's taste. With his own hop supplies, Grant Hay had lowered his costs of production and unit costs considerably. He then followed Courage Brewery's example by purchasing his own pubs and hotel outlets across Australia, exclusively serving Richmond beer. =Success & Output= The Richmond Brewery was a remarkable success. By 1940 shipments of Richmond Lager were eagerly consumed in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. By 1950 annual turnover revenues in the Richmond Brewery had grown to almost three million pounds. Exports to India and Brazil soon followed, with the bottle labels Richmond Pilsener, Lager Bitter and Stout all sporting the illustrated Tiger's head logo, designed by Mrs Grant Hay. =World War II & Racing= During World War II, Grant Hay negotiated the supply of Richmond Beer to Australian troops in North Africa and American troops stationed at Sandown Racecourse, which he owned. He also purchased land on Flinders Island in Tasmania where he stood Fourth Hand, winner of the 1927 Irish 2,000 Guineas and bred champion Australian racehorse Counsel, winner of the 1944 Caulfield Cup and champion American racehorse, Warra Nymph at Del Mar.Warra Nymph's win one for equine history, Sydney Morning Herald 22 August 2010 Grant Hay also owned the seventy-two foot ketch, \\"Jane Moorhead\\" which was used by General Douglas MacArthur for the Allied troop landings in the Pacific. By 1960 the brewery continued to prosper controlling sixteen per cent of Victorian beer sales and eight per cent of Australian beer sales nationally. Mr Grant Hay's health was however deteriorating and no succession plan was put in place, despite his only surviving son. A charismatic autocrat and fierce business competitor, Mr Grant Hay would not allow the company to be controlled by anyone but himself. He refused to publicly list the company and repeatedly rejected merger offers from Courage Brewery and Carlton & United Breweries. Upon his death in 1961,Obituary: Peter Grant Hay Ancestry, 29 August 1961 Mrs Grant Hay negotiated the sale of the Richmond Brewery between bidders Courage Brewery, Asahi Breweries and Carlton & United Breweries, accepting a final offer to purchase the brewery from Carlton & United Breweries on January 26, 1962. =Terms of Settlement= The financial terms of the agreement reached included an undisclosed cash and share settlement to the Grant Hay family in Carlton & United Breweries, with the caveat that no member of the Grant Hay family or its heirs shall commence operations in a brewing enterprise against Carlton & United Breweries or its subsidiaries in Australia until after the year 2018. Mr Grant Hay is survived by his direct descendants including his grandson, James Grant Hay. Carlton & United Breweries closed the Richmond Brewery doors on April 13, 1962, and later demolished and sold the site in 1964. Carlton & United Breweries own the intellectual property labels of the Richmond Brewery. Foster's Group Limited was renamed Carlton & United Breweries prior to its 2011 sale to British-South African multinational SABMiller. =Appendix= The Richmond Brewery Company's headquarters were located at 654 Church Street, Richmond and had offices at 26 Hunter Street and Sussex Street, Sydney, 86 King Street, Perth and 5 Cliff Street, Freemantle. There were one hundred and thirty five full-time staff and the company owned and operated twenty-eight hotels and pubs across Australia.

She was one of the earliest female professional photographers in Sweden. Biography Photograph of Uppsala Cathedral, 1889 Born in Uppsala on 21 September 1827, Schenson was the daughter of the academy treasurer John Schenson and the school administrator Maria Magdalena Hahr. There are no records of her education or of how she became familiar with photography. By the 1860s, she had opened a studio in Uppsala, becoming one of Sweden's earliest female professional photographers and the first to establish a business in Uppsala. In addition to photographs of Uppsala Cathedral, she produced a series of some 20 albumen prints as a tribute to the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778). In the 1880s and 90s, she produced a further technically perfect series of the cathedral showing the progress and results of restoration work. The images reveal not only her technical skills but also her aptitude at positioning the camera to obtain architecturally excellent images. Although Schenson's negatives have disappeared, her photographs of the cathedral under repair can be seen in an album at the university library. Emma Schenson died in Uppsala on 17 March 1913. She is remembered as one of Sweden's earliest female professional photographers along with Rosalie Sjöman in Stockholm, Hilda Sjölin in Malmö and Wilhelmina Lagerholm in Örebro.

The upland moorland ridge site is listed for its heath, flush and upland grassland which provide a habitat for a nationally important assemblage of moorland breeding birds. Location and natural features Allendale Moors is situated in the north-east of England, east of Alston and west of Allenheads, and between East and West Allen Dales – tributaries of the River Allen – and Nent Dale and Upper Weardale; all found in the south-west of the Northumberland. The u-shaped site, which excludes the valley of the West River Allen from Carrshield northwards, is some north to south, and east to west. It is at the northern extent and part of the North Pennines, itself designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and it borders three other SSSI, Whitfield Moor, Plenmeller and Ashholme Commons, High Knock Shield Meadow and White Ridge Meadow, and it overlaps Hartley Cleugh SSSI. Hexhamshire Moors SSSI is immediately to the east, separated by the valley of the River East Allen. The site is composed of upland moorland ridges and plateau, above a number of north to south falling watercourses – between the River Nent to the west and slightly eastwards, the River West Allen; and then between the River West Allen and the River East Allen. The site is at elevations from circa along the northerly boundaries, to circa and above on the southern boundary. The terrain is one of the most extensive blanket mires in the north of England, and provides a variety of heath, flush and upland grassland habitats for moorland breeding birds. Underlying the mire is Carboniferous limestone, with abundant lichen-rich outcrops. More generally, Allendale is part of a mineral rich area – the North Pennine Orefield – long-mined and thus littered with spoil heaps of varying ages and states of revegetation, affected by heavy metal contamination, particularly from zinc and lead, and supporting metal tolerant plants such as spring sandwort (Minuartia verna). =Vegetation= The moorland has a number of distinct vegetative zones. The plateau is dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris) and hare's-tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) with local patches of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix). Other notable species include deergrass (Trichophorum cespitosum), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) and bog mosses such as (Sphagnum papillosum) and (S. capillifolium var. rubellum). Dry heath and acid grassland is found on peripheral areas of the plateau, the former supporting heather, wavy hair - grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), and with heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) dominating the latter, with mat-grass (Nardus stricta), wavy hair-grass tormentil, (Potentilla erecta) and heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile). The moor has numerous areas of acidic flush characterised by an abundance of soft-rush (Juncus effusus), bog moss (Sphagnum recurvum) and star-moss (Polytrichum commune). There are also a smaller number of species-rich flushes supporting sharp-flowered rush (Juncus acutiflorus), common sedge (Carex nigra), star sedge (Carex echinata), marsh bedstraw (Galium palustre), lesser spearwort (Ranunculus flammula) and marsh violet (Viola palustris). Great Limestone outcrops support rich lichen communities, including elm gyalecta (Gyalecta ulmi), a rare and endanged species, and a number of other species rare in Northumberland. =Fauna= The open moorland supports a collection of breeding birds considered to be of national importance, and including merlin, golden plover, red grouse, black grouse, short-eared owl and dunlin. The moor and associated grassland supports curlew, snipe, lapwing and redshank. Ownership The land is owned by Allendale Estates, the estate management company of the 4th Viscount Allendale.

They formerly took the name Paspati, which may have been unfortunately misinterpreted as the Sundanese “pas mati” - \\"when death\\". Pasupati is a portmanteau of Jalan Pasteur and Jalan Surapati.Affandy, Frances B., Andi Abubakar.2003. The Pasupati structures have links back to the town planning work of Thomas Karsten. The current structure was built as a result of an infrastructure grant from Kuwait. After many years of delays and issues, initial trials were carried out on June 26, 2005.  Structure  The Pasupati Bridge is the first in Indonesia that utilizes anti-earthquake technology. A lock up device (LUD), engineered in France, consists of 76 individual pieces. The bridge has 663 segments overall, supported by 46 poles. Each segment weighs from 80 tons up to 140 tons. The overpass structure includes a long cable-stayed bridge that crosses 161 meters above the Cikapundung valley with no intervening supports. The bridge over the Cikapundung is supported by 19 steel cables consisting of 10 wires on the western side and 9 cables on the eastern side.

The Frank–Van der Merwe crystal growth model carries his name and he was awarded numerous South African academic prizes. He is sometimes referred to as the \\"Father of Epitaxy\\". His research is seen as fundamental to applications in communication technology.  Education and early life  Van der Merwe was born on 28 February 1922 to Dorslandtrekkers (Afrikaner farmer-settlers) Johannes Marthinus van der Merwe and Catharina Margaretha van der Merwe in Humpata, Angola. Although his parents both came from large families - his father had four siblings and his mother had five siblings - he was an only child. In 1928, he and his family moved to what was formerly South-West Africa (now Namibia). It is believed that they travelled by ox-wagon. During his formative years the family moved between present day Outjo and Gobabis and finally settled in Otjiwarongo, where he first attended an actual primary school. He attended secondary school in Windhoek. In 1941 he attended the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa on a bursary. After obtaining a BSc in engineering at the University of Stellenbosch, he was persuaded by the head of the applied mathematics department to change to an MSc in applied mathematics, which he completed in 1945. In 1946 he was appointed junior lecturer in the department of applied mathematics. He went to work at the CSIR in Pretoria in 1947 under the supervision of Meiring Naudé. He was awarded a bursary by the CSIR to study in Britain. Between 1947 and 1949, he did a PhD in theoretical solid state physics at the University of Bristol under Nevill Francis Mott. During his time in Bristol he befriended several people who went on to become noted physicists including C.F. Powell (a Physics Nobel Laureate), Arthur Tyndall and Doris Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf. In late 1949, he returned to the CSIR.  Career in research  It was in Bristol in the period 1947 to 1949 that he started working on intercrystalline boundaries, together with Charles Frank. Eventually their research led them to study epitaxy, and in 1949 they presented the fruits of their research in a series of scientific papers. The result was the Frank–Van der Merwe crystal growth model which carries both their names. Rutile epitaxial on hematite (Bahia, Brazil) From 1953 to 1964 he served as senior lecturer and Associate Professor in the physics department at the University of Pretoria. He completed his MSc in Mathematics from the University of Pretoria in 1956. During this period he again worked with a colleague from Bristol, Frank Nabarro who was then head of Physics at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. In 1961 he took a sabbatical to the University of Virginia which led to a refinement of his initial model of thickening two-dimensional interfaces in 1963. The theory of epitaxy was a major focus of his career and he published many seminal papers, which resulted in him becoming known as the \\"Father of Epitaxy\\". With the advance of the semiconductor industry from the 1960s onward, epitaxy became extremely important as it depends on the growth of perfect single crystals for the manufacturing of transistors and IC circuits. An essential role in understanding how to grow such perfect crystals was provided by his theory. Van der Merwe's model of atomic forces paved the way for successful modelling of important physical phenomena in solids at the atomic scale. He personally regarded his solution to a differential equation in his PhD thesis as one of his biggest achievements. This was basically a soliton differential equation with an ingenious solution, the first ever analytical solution to a soliton problem. Solitons in solid state and other branches of physics became important for advanced applications in communication technology. In 1965, he was invited by an ex-CSIR colleague, Ernst Marais, to the University of Port Elizabeth where he was appointed head of the applied mathematics department. During this period Van der Merwe was invited to present plenary talks at many international conferences, during which he made enduring friendships with several surface scientists including Ernst G. Bauer of the Technical University of Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Ralf Vanselow of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. In 1969 he moved to UNISA where he became Professor of applied mathematics. In 1970 he spent a seven-month sabbatical at the University of Virginia where he collaborated with William A. Jesser. Almost 30 years later, in 1999 he co-authored a paper with Jesser. In 1972, he accepted the position of head of the physics department at the University of Pretoria. From this point on he regularly collaborated with Gary Shiflet of the University of Virginia. Almost 20 years later, Shiflet and Van der Merwe co- authored papers on interphase boundaries. After his mandatory retirement at age 65, he became Professor Extraordinarius at UNISA from 1990 to 2003, and Honorary Professor in the Department of Physics at University of Pretoria from 2004 to 2016. In 1981 and 1989 he was Visiting Professor at the Technical University of Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany and Visiting Researcher to Kodak Research Labs, USA in 1981. Letter from Jan H van der Merwe at the age of 80 in 2002, requesting the copy of a publication about an analytical solution to a mathematical model from a colleague.  Awards and honours  Some of the awards presented to Van der Merwe are: * Havenga Prize for Physics (1967) from the Suid-Afikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (South African Academy of Science and Art) * E.W. Muller Award (University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, USA) * FRD A rating first awarded in 1984 and re-awarded until the end of his working career (National Research Foundation) * De Beers Gold Medal in Physics (1984) * DSc (honoris causa) University of South Africa (1984), * SAMS award for the best publication in the South African Journal of Physics (1987) * The South Africa Order for Excellent Service, Class 1: Gold (1989) * DSc (honoris causa) University of Pretoria (1990) * DSc (honoris causa) University of Port Elizabeth (1994) * Gold Medal of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science (1998) * Tuks Alumni Laureatus Award for Eminent Scientific Achievements (2000) * Centenary Award, Leading Minds 1908 to 2008 (University of Pretoria) (2008) In 2000 a Symposium in honour of Van der Merwe was arranged by the American Society for Metals, Materials and Minerals to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his discovery of Interfacial Dislocations. The Materials Research Society published a Focus Issue titled \\"Jan van der Merwe: Epitaxy and the Computer Age\\" in November 2017.  Personal life  In 1947, just before leaving South Africa for Bristol, he married Minnie de Villiers and they had their honeymoon on the ship to the UK. In late 1949 they returned to Pretoria, South Africa in time for the birth of their first child Pauline (1950). Willem was born in 1954, Jan in 1957 and Anna was adopted in 1957. His son Jan died in 1994, his daughter Pauline in 1999 and his wife in 2006. Van der Merwe died on his birthday, 28 February 2016 at the home of his son Willem.

Colin M. Warwick, Alastair A Macdonald. Veterinary History Journal 2006 He came from an old Quaker family in Cheshire, England. Early life John Barlow was born on 20 September 1815 in Chorley near Alderley Edge in the old picturesque house known as The Oaks, which had been in the family for some 200 years. He was the oldest of seven children, three sons and four daughters, to another John Barlow (1789–1846) and his wife Deborah Neild (1790–1850). His father was a farmer and it was always assumed that as he grew up he too would help on the farm, but his love of the animals led him another direction. Education He went first to the Quaker school Ackworth in South Yorkshire for four years, before for a while helping on the farm, where he became fascinated by the illnesses the animals were prone to. This interest eventually took him to Edinburgh in 1842 where he enrolled at Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Clyde Street. In 1844 he gained his diploma and was awarded various medals including the silver medal for the best paper submitted on ‘puerperal fever’ in cows. Career He moved to Edinburgh and William Dick, founder and head of the veterinary college, realising his potential, took him on as assistant professor of anatomy and physiology and in 1855 as full professor. He was the first to introduce the microscope to the scientific studies at the school and his many scientific papers which appeared in such publications as The North British Agriculturalist were and remain to this day the basis of much modern research. He was a close friend of Joseph Lister and John Bright whom he was with at Ackworth. Professor William Williams, the founder and Principal of the New Veterinary College in Edinburgh said some years after Barlow's death, that \\"Professor Barlow was a pioneer of Veterinary Science, a man living one hundred years before his time. The others were rule of thumb practitioners, while he brought the light of science to bear upon the profession.\\" His contemporary James Simpson, the pioneer of chloroform, described him as \\"a man destined to advance and elevate veterinary science\\"; Professor William Gairdner, Glasgow's first Medical Officer, called him \\"a great original thinker, so truthful and so unselfish\\".

South Edinburgh Meeting, Quakers Scotland. Retrieved September 2015 Quaker life All his life, John Barlow followed the doctrines of the Society of Friends (Quakers) whose Christian beliefs shaped his gentle, modest, unassuming character. The Edinburgh Friends were a group of strong Liberals in politics and amongst Barlow's close circle was Joseph Lister, later Lord Lister, the pioneer in antiseptic surgery. Like most Quakers of the period John Barlow married within the faith. His wife, Eliza Nicholson of Whitehaven, was herself a descendant of James Lancaster, one of the first followers of George Fox, the founder of Quakerism. Of their three children, John Henry Barlow, went on to be one of the Society's most prominent elder statesmen in World War I, leading the pacifist cause and securing the right to abstain on grounds of conscience and helping to start The Friends Ambulance Unit. He was also the founder of George Cadbury's pioneer housing experiment, The Bournville Village Trust in Birmingham. Bibliography * Barlow, J.

He played nine first-class matches for Otago between 1865 and 1876. Downes was born in Nantwich, Cheshire, and went to Australia with his family. He later moved on to New Zealand, attracted by the Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s. Described as a man of \\"commanding presence, fine physique and genial nature\\", he began playing for Otago soon after his arrival. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese described Downes as \\"the best bowler in New Zealand before 1876 ... a medium-fast bowler with a splendid length and a considerable leg-twist\\".

Before its description in 2016, it was first considered to belong to the southern crested newt (Triturus karelinii) and then the Balkan crested newt (Triturus ivanbureschi). The three species form a complex of morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species. Genetic data demonstrated the Anatolian crested newt to be distinct from the other two species, although it hybridises with the Balkan crested newt at its western range end. With its two closely related species, the Anatolian crested newt is more stockily built than the other crested newts, and reaches 10–13 cm in length. It is semiaquatic, spending most of the year on land and only returning to water for breeding. The species does not seem to be immediately threatened, although a formal IUCN Red List assessment has not been conducted yet. Systematics and taxonomy The Anatolian crested newt was described by Ben Wielstra and Jan Willem Arntzen in 2016. Mitochondrial DNA data had already suggested that it was a separate species in a 2013 study, but the authors had preferred to await a more detailed analysis before formal species description and temporarily included it in the Balkan crested newt (Triturus ivanbureschi), which had been split from the southern crested newt (T. karelinii). Nuclear DNA analysis then confirmed that its populations form a distinct gene pool, although it detected a hybrid zone where the species' range borders that of its sister species, the Balkan crested newt, in western Anatolia. Description No morphological criteria are known to distinguish the Anatolian crested newt from the Balkan and the southern crested newt; the three are cryptic species. Like the other two closely related species, it is a rather stout newt which measures and has 12–13 rib-bearing vertebrae. Its back and sides are brown–black with darker spots; the underside is orange with black blotches whose pattern is variable among individuals. Females do not develop a crest and swollen cloaca, and have a smaller tail fin during the aquatic phase. Distribution and habitats The species is endemic to northern Anatolia on the Black Sea coast, where its range extends roughly from the Bosphorus and Bursa in the west to Trabzon in the east, reaching no more than inland. type locality near Gölköy. Behaviour and ecology Like other Triturus species, the Anatolian crested newt initially develops in the water, but spends most of the year in shady habitats on land as an adult. It returns to breeding ponds every year, where males develop a conspicuous dorsal crests and court the females. Eggs are folded in leaves of water plants. Threats and conservation The Anatolian and the Balkan crested newt, split only recently from the southern crested newt, have not yet gone through a Red List assessment according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's criteria. A previous assessment reported the southern crested newt, including both now-accepted species, as widespread, with no immediate threats known, in Turkey. All crested newts are listed in the Bern Convention (appendix II) and the EU Habitats Directive (annex II and IV), which prohibit capture, disturbance, killing, trade, and destruction of habitats.

Public career At the 1935 Queensland state election, Walsh, a member of the Labor Party, defeated the Country and Progressive National Party candidate and future Prime Minister of Australia, Arthur Fadden, for the seat of Mirani in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He held Mirani until the 1947 state election when he was defeated by Ernie Evans of the Country Party. As Walsh was the Deputy Premier of Queensland at the time, efforts were made to immediately find a safe Labor electorate for him but in the end he had to wait until the 1950 state election to be back in the parliament, this time as the member for Bundaberg. He went on to represent the seat until his retirement in 1969. When the Premier of Queensland, Vince Gair, was expelled from the Labor Party over his refusal to obey party policy to grant three weeks annual leave for public servants, he, along with Walsh and most of the Ministry then formed the Queensland Labor Party and attempted to govern as a minority government but five weeks later lost a vote on supply and an election was called. Whilst Walsh kept his seat, both Labor parties suffered losses, and for the first time since 1932, a conservative government ruled Queensland. When the QLP amalgamated with the national Democratic Labor Party Walsh refused to support it and at the 1963 and 1966 state elections stood as an Independent. Whilst he was strongly anti-communist, he at first opposed banning the Communist Party of Australia, but in 1951 he supported the 'Yes' case in the Federal referendum. In October 1944, Walsh engaged in a fist-fight with Tom Aikens, the newly elected Independent member for Mundingburra in the Speaker's lobby. When both members were ordered to appear before the Bar of the House to answer the charge of having created a disturbance, they tendered their apologies to the Parliament. While intensely loyal to his friends, he was extremely hostile to his enemies, of whom there were many. It was alleged that Walsh had a \\"little black book\\" in which a record of his fellow parliamentarians' indiscretions was kept for use in times of \\"trouble\\" and \\"difficulties\\". Nor was he averse to using his position to bestow gifts in the form of Golden Casket art union franchises. Walsh held several portfolios in the Labor Ministry, and they included: * Deputy Premier 1946–47 and 1957 * Treasurer 1952–57 * Minister for Transport 1944–47 * Minister for Public Lands 1940–44 * Acting Treasurer 1951–52 References Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:1894 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Treasurers of Queensland Category:Deputy Premiers of Queensland Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Queensland Category:Queensland Labor Party members of the Parliament of Queensland Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Ted Walsh (politician)"},{"id":"50478388","text":"Uberisation or uberization is a neologism describing the commoditization of an existing service-based industry by new participants using computing platforms, such as mobile applications, in order to aggregate transactions between clients and providers of a service, often bypassing the role of existing intermediaries as part of the so-called platform economy. This business model has different operating costs compared to a traditional business. The term is derived from the company name \\"Uber\\". The company developed a mobile application that allows consumers to submit a trip request which is then routed to Uber drivers who use their own cars. Background Uberisation has been made possible by the development of digital technologies developed in the 20th and 21st centuries. Business organisations such as Uber, Grab, Lyft and Airbnb enable potential customers to be put into direct contact with potential providers of a service. The phenomenon of uberisation is characterised by the elimination or quasi-elimination of middle man roles. Uberised business formats are characterised by the following elements: * The use of a digitalised platform enabling peer-to-peer, or quasi-peer to peer transactions * Minimising the distance between the provider and customer of a service * The use of a rating system for the quality of the service provided by a provider. Prevalence Uberisation has, as of yet, taken place in a limited but growing amount of industries. For example, with the advent of Airbnb, the hospitality industry has been transformed to a large extent, estimated by industry analysts to have a total annual value, just in New York City, of over US $2.1 billion. While uberisation has been criticised as potentially catalysing a chaotic shift by undermining existing corporate models in the hospitality and taxi industries, existing companies in industries such as marketing can use the phenomenon to reduce expenses and provide more specialised services for customers. Ethical concerns Uberisation has been criticised for its role in facilitating the decline of labour-intensive industries, and hence for threatening jobs. Uberisation has also raised concerns over government regulations and taxation, insofar as the formalised application of the sharing economy has led to disputes over the extent to which the provider of services via an uberised platform should be held accountable to corporate regulations and tax obligations.

If so, his mother was Hedwig, daughter of Wichmann the Elder. Gero was the brother of Tetta, who established a monastery at Alsleben in his name. Thietmar of Merseburg, whose Chronicon is the major source of information here, refers to Gero as a Count in Northern Thuringia and Morzani. Gero was accused before Emperor Otto II by the Saxon warrior Waldo of a crime. Neither the identity of Waldo nor the crime are known. At the instigation of Adalbert, Archbishop of Magdeburg, and Dietrich, Margrave of the Northern March, Gero was captured at Sömmering and placed in the custody of Thietmar's father and uncle, Siegfried I, Count of Walbeck, and Lothair I, Margrave of the Nordmark. In accordance with the practice of trial by combat, Gero and Waldo met for a judicial duel on 11 August 979. During the fight, Gero's strikes resulted in two serious blows to the neck of Waldo, but Waldo was able to counter with a heavy blow to Gero’s head. With his opponent too dizzy to continue, Waldo left the site and disarmed, only to suddenly die of his wounds. Despite clearly winning the combat, Gero was declared guilty and sentenced to death. On the emperor’s orders, Gero was beheaded at sunset. Apparently, the only ones pleased with the verdict were Adalbert and Dietrich. Otto I, Duke of Swabia and Bavaria, who arrived later in the day, and Berthold, Count of the Radenzgau, rebuked the emperor, Otto II, for allowing such a man to be condemned on a petty charge. The remarkable outcome of this duel was long remembered in medieval Germany. Gero married Adela of an unknown family. Gero and Adela had one daughter: * Adela of Alsleben, married Siegfried II, Count of Stade. No other counts of Alsleben are recorded until the 12th century.

Accessed 9 July 2017. It was thus crucial that its application seem different from the previous slave laws. Written contracts had to be registered documenting the employment of Khoikhoi servants for periods of one month or longer. It also claimed to provide a safeguard against their ill treatment, making it compulsory that they were paid for any services that they provided. According to the Apprenticeship of Servants Proclamation of 1812, in support of the Hottentot Proclamation, white settlers could apprentice and employ a Coloured child without paying them from the age of eight to eighteen years if the child was an orphan, destitute or grew up on the employer's property. Implementation Portrait of the 4th Earl of Caledon Earl of Caledon imposed the Caledon Code in his capacity as the first Governor of the Cape Colony after occupation by Britain in 1806. The eastern and north-eastern districts of the Cape Colony were most affected by the declaration since most of the Khoikhoi population was based in these areas. It stated that the Khoikhoi were to have a “fixed place of abode” and that they could not travel freely, requiring a passport if they were found outside of their stipulated area. This prevented them from moving away from farms in which they worked as slaves unless their passes were signed by their employer. If asked to produce a pass by a white settler, they were to present the document verifying that they had permission from their employer to be away from home. Repeal Led by Dr John Philip, who continually worked against the discriminatory treatment of indigenous South Africans, British missionaries protested the Hottentot Proclamation. Even while he was back in Britain, from 1826 to 1828, Philip fought for the emancipation of tribes in the Cape. Ordinance No. 50 of 1828 banned incoming British settlers from buying slaves, repealing the proclamation in that year. This freed the Coloured slaves while from the pass system while Black people were still enslaved in accordance to the Ordinance No. 49 of 1828 which still issued them passes for the sole purpose of seeking work. All the slaves living in British colonies were to be freed after serving what is described as a period of apprenticeship, which only ended in 1838 in the Cape Colony.

Larvae are nocturnal, fossorial, and heavily armoured. Several Namibian Tenebrionids, such as Onymacris unguicularis and Onymacris bicolor, have evolved a specialised surface on their elytra, forming minute droplets from the fog which regularly occurs along the coast. Droplets condense by virtue of alternating hydrophobic, wax-coated and hydrophilic, non-waxy regions. When the beetle adopts a head-down stance facing into the fog-laden wind, condensed water drains towards its mouthparts where it is swallowed. Studies on the population density of dune beetles in the Namib Desert have shown that the fog-collecting beetles' numbers are not diminished by periods of low rainfall, whereas other Tenebrionids decline dramatically.http://www.asknature.org/strategy/dc2127c6d0008a6c7748e4e4474e7aa1 The microstructure of the elytra has been copied by cancer researchers so as to control 'spheroid sizes of therapeutic islet cells and mesenchymal stem cells'.http://www.jove.com/visualize/abstract/25323327/spheroform-therapeutic- spheroid-forming-nanotextured-surfaces Etymology 'Physosterna' - swollen or bladder-like sterna 'cribripes' - perforated or sieve-like foot See also *Onymacris unguicularis, another fog-basking Namib desert beetle *Stenocara gracilipes, another fog-basking Namib desert beetle References External links *iSpot images *Gallery Category:Tenebrionidae Category:Insects of Angola Category:Beetles described in 1875 ","title":"Physosterna cribripes"},{"id":"50478828","text":"Levi Rolla Cooper (born July 24, 1990) is an American professional wrestler currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Tucker.

History The area was originally part of the Fazenda Santa Genebra, a coffee plantation owned by Baron Geraldo de Resende, which covered the present Barão Geraldo de Resende district and some parts of the city of Campinas. The Baron invested heavily in new technology for his plantation and went bankrupt. His lands were auctioned off, and the Oliveira family bought the part that holds the forest, which they preserved. José Pedro de Oliveira, who became owner, thought that the fresh air of the forest would help control his tuberculosis. After his death his widow donated the forest to the municipality. On the date of the donation, 14 July 1981, the Fundação José Pedro de Oliveira was established to use the forest for strictly scientific and cultural purposes. In 1983 Mata de Santa Genebra was designated a National Heritage area. Mata de Santa Genebra Area of Relevant Ecological Interest was created by decree 91.885 on 5 November 1985. Location Mata de Santa Genebra has an area of . The conservation unit covers parts of the municipalities of Campinas and Paulínia in the state of São Paulo. The unit is jointly administered by the Federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and by the city of Campinas represented by the Fundação José Pedro de Oliveira.

F.L.S. (1887–1917) was an English botanist and ecologist who is remembered for her studies of brown seaweeds and zonation patterns on the seashore. Bladderwrack, or Fucus vesiculosus, was one of the seaweeds Baker studied.  Early life  Born in London on 4 June 1887, she was the daughter of Martha Braithwaite Baker and George Samuel Baker and grew up in a Quaker family with two younger brothers, George and Bevan. As well as their main London home the family had a country house at Mersea Island where Baker first took an interest in seaweed. She is said to have been interested in plants and flowers from an early age. Another interest was art and she studied briefly at the Slade School of Art before moving into science. This art training resulted in her producing scientific illustrations of high quality.  Education and career  Baker began studying at University College London in 1906, where one of her teachers was the chemist Sir William Ramsay,Miss Sarah Martha Baker D.Sc., in The Times, 30 May 1917 and received a Bachelor of Science degree with first class honours in 1909. After a short time in Munich in 1910, she returned to research in botanical chemistry in London. She was generally described as energetic and very hard-working. In 1912 she was chosen for the Quain Studentship in Botany accompanied by a lectureship at University College. This placed her in an enlightened environment by the standards of the early 20th century. Not only had University College been the first academic institution in the UK to admit female students, but from 1890 its Department of Botany under Professor F.W.Oliver was quite progressive. It granted several doctorates in botany to women, employed a reasonable number of female staff and gave the prestigious Quain award to women as often as to men.Discussing the period 1890-1927, in Peder Anker, Imperial Ecology: Environmental Order in the British Empire, 1895-1945, Harvard UP 2009, p9 In 1913 Baker received her doctorate for work on the effect of formaldehyde on living plants, and in 1914 was elected a fellow of the Linnaean Society. In 1916 she was elected to the Council of the British Ecological Society.  Research  Whitecliff Bay, near Bembridge, was one location for Baker's zonation research. Baker belonged to a pioneering era in ecologyMichael Kaiser, Marine Ecology: Processes, Systems, and Impacts, OUP 2011, p179 when researchers began to use experimentation to take ecology beyond being merely descriptive.Michael H. Graham, Joan Parker, Paul K. Dayton, The Essential Naturalist: Timeless Readings in Natural History, University of Chicago, 2011, p299 She was not the only one to think the shore provided good opportunities for ecological study.D.Raffaelli, S.Hawkins, Intertidal Ecology, Springer 2012 Baker's work on seaweed zoning explored the tendency for different types to thrive at different distances from the high tide mark. She decided to test whether \\"differential tolerance to desiccation stress was what determines zonation in marine algae\\". She undertook the laborious work of measuring distances on the shore, collecting specimens, putting them in numerous jars and \\"var[ying] their exposure to drying\\". Her conclusions suggested that competition between the various fucaceae was important. This idea went out of fashion for some time but is now accepted as part of the explanation for zonation.U.Sommer, B.Worm, Competition and Coexistence, Springer 2012 One writer has even called her \\"prophetic\\".D.Raffaelli, S.Hawkins, Intertidal Ecology, Springer 2012, quoting and agreeing with Connell (1972) When she began to look at the effects of formaldehyde on living plants her experimental methods became more complex and sophisticated. She went on studying photosynthesis and had intended to do more in that field had she not died young.  Volunteering  Alongside her scientific work she did voluntary work for the Society of Friends (Quakers)Annual Monitor for 1918 ...an obituary of members of the Society of Friends...,Gloucester, 1917 and is credited with an inspirational quotation used on the ‘Botanists’ panel of a Quaker tapestryQuaker tapestry botanists panel which comes from an obituary report of her Sunday school students’ memories of her. When the First World War began she joined University College's Voluntary Aid Detachment.  End of life  She died on 29 May 1917 just before reaching her 30th birthday. The Times claimed that \\"her death was due to overwork\\". A Sarah M.

La criatura is notable, like Walerian Borowczyk's La Bête (1975) and Nagisa Oshima's Max, Mon Amour (1986), for openly involving zoophilia, then a novelty in Spanish Cinema.Mira, The A to Z of Spanish Cinema, p.170 Shot in 1977, the film employs bestiality as a symbol of Spain's political landscape. It makes references to the massacre of Atocha and to political right wing groups that after the death of Francisco Franco, tried to maintain the dictator’s political ideals.  Plot  Marcos and Cristina are a well to do couple who had have been married for several years. Their relationship has been strained, in part because they have not been able to have children. They are overjoyed when Cristina unexpectedly gets pregnant. Close to give birth, Cristina’s hopes are shattered when stopping at a gas station she is attacked by a black German Shepherd. The shock of the attack makes Cristina give birth prematurely to a stillborn son. To help his wife forget the tragedy, Marcos takes Cristina to the same sea side resort where they had spent their honeymoon. Cristina recovers her strength and becomes attach to a stray dog that befriends her at the beach. The dog is also a black German Shepherd, the same breed as the one that caused her misfortune. Frightened at first, she soon began to pet the dog that proves to be charming, tame and very fond of her. Against her husband’s protestations, Cristina takes the dog back home to the city. Marcos, a successful presenter of a TV variety show, is a conservative Catholic sympathetic to right wing politics. He remains faithful to his wife, dismissing the romantic advances of Vicky, the cohost of his TV program. While her husband is occupied at work, Cristina finds in her dog an outlet to the love she could not give to the child she lost. She calls her dog Bruno. The name she and her husband had previously chosen for their unborn son. Marcos buys a new country house in the mountains for him and his wife. He is distraught by the increasing attention his wife gives to the dog. Cristina soon prefers the dog’s to her husband’s company. When Marcos tries to be intimate to his wife, the dog gets jealous and attacks him. Following Vicky's advise, Marcos buys a female dog, a White Shepherd. His strategy seems to work as Bruno begins to spend more time with his mate. However, Cristina dislike the new dog. She is horrified when she finds the dogs mating. Shortly after, the female dog appears dead without explanation. The relationship between Cristina and Bruno becomes even closer. One day Marcos arrives home finding his wife in bed with her wedding gown on the side spotting marks of Bruno's paws all over the dress implying that Cristina had had sex with the dog. Appalled, Marcos asks for advise to father Abelardo, the family's priest, who tells him to be firm an immediately give the dog away. The priest recommends a local teacher who lovingly takes care of the dog. Cristina is upset of being forced to give the dog away, but concedes. Marcos makes an effort to rekindle the love in his marriage. He wants to try again to have children. However, he is distracted as he takes on a new political career in defense of his conservative views which he feels are threaten under the new democratic Spain. Cristina, who is as liberal as her husband is conservative, dislikes Marcos's political career. When Cristina refuses to have sex with her husband, Marco gets drunk and rapes her. Confronted by Marcos about her relationship with the dog, Cristina compares Spanish society to a hall of distorting mirrors. \\"I am surrounded by monsters. All I can do is become more monstrous than they are!\\" Cristina is tormented by nightmares. A phone call from her doctor awakes her telling her that she is pregnant. Resolute, Cristina packs her bags, leaves her husband, retrieves Bruno and goes to leave happily in the house on the mountains with her dog.

The northern part of the field was active 700 BCE ± 50 years, forming a large lava flow field and a cinder cone Cerro Keyocc. The southern part of the field contains other cinder cones and lava flows. Some may be of Holocene age. Lava flows are a few thick. Four among the volcanoes of the southern field are Marbas Grande, Marbas, Marbas Chico I and Marbas Chico II. The formation of these fields may have been influenced by magma ascent along deep fault systems. Trachyandesite is the major eruption product of Huambo. The magmas forming this field formed in deep magma chambers with little modification in shallower magma chambers. Basement lava flows have been dated at 1.05±0.04 mya.

Tzortzis has tried to distance himself from allegations of extremism, and now says he preaches about peace and compassion. He considers himself just Muslim. Career Tzortzis has been invited as a guest speaker at several universities and Muslim conferences. He has spoken in the United Kingdom and Australia. Tzortzis was involved in publishing a survey study in 2010 to gauge non-Muslims' views of Islam in the United Kingdom. In 2015 he was a finalist for Religious Advocate of the Year at the British Muslim Awards. Tzortzis has contributed to the BBC news programs: The Big Questions and Newsnight.

Her father died when she was an infant.. When she was five, her mother remarried to a businessman named Jiao Dezhai. The family was poor. When she was 9 or 10, they sent her to the National Drama School to learn a trade and receive meals. This school had been opened in 1930 as the first coeducational opera school in China and aimed to reform education of Peking opera singers and musicians. For the two centuries before women appeared on Shanghai's stages in the 1870s, female opera roles had been played by men. Because of the association with prostitution, the work was still stigmatized and female students, despite usually being driven into acting by poverty, had previously needed private tutors. The school was a more respectable setting but Jiao adopted her mother's assumed name of Li in order to avoid shaming her father. Along with the other members of the school's fourth class, Li then adopted a stage name incorporating the generation component \\"jade\\": Li Yuru. While there, Li memorized plays and participated in \\"arduous\\" physical exercises. Her training focused on the \\"verdant-clad\\", \\"flowery\\", and \\"sword-and-horse\\" roles but covered a variety of schools. She studied six days a week and was permitted family visits on Sundays. Beatings were given for poor behaviour, slow learning, or as part of a collective punishment for a single student's mistake, but teachers were expressly forbidden from striking a student's head. =Career= Li and the actresses of her generation \\"played an important role in the development of [Peking Opera] as they transformed the dan into a role also played by females\\". She credited her later success to her school's eclectic training but Li's first performance was a disaster. Given a supporting role with four lines six months into her training, she failed to hit the high notes and was noticed and jeered by the audience. For the next five years, she only received walk-on roles. She put the experience to good use: \\"Through playing extras, I learned the plays that had not been taught to our year. I also observed not only my own character type but also other roles. I familiarized myself with the stage and the audience\\".Li Yuru, interview with Li Ruru on 22 April 2007. She woke at 6 each morning (two hours ahead of the other students) and took extra classes. The audience had also become familiar with her. At age 14, she was given the gown and star role of the Princess in a performance whose lead and understudy had both lost their voices. She later recalled that, when she struck her first pose, before saying a line, \\"the applause and shouting started. It was so loud that my ears were rin[g]ing. Afterwards, every line I sang or spoke and every eye expression I made would gain a full-house ovation\\". At 14, she was a \\"star student\\" and began \\"playing all types of leading roles\\", all the more so because the principal and registrar hadn't realized she'd learned the part ahead of the school's curriculum. Over the course of her training, Li studied about 40 hua dan (\\"flowery role\\") plays.. Graduating at age 17 in 1940, she established her own troupe with friends from the school. She organised a program of 62 new and traditional plays over a successful 48-day run in Shanghai, starring in 28 of them. Disliking the pressure she came under as an independent young actress, she disbanded the troupe and placed herself under the training and protection of older male actors: Xun Huisheng and Mei Lanfang, two of the \\"Four Great Dan\\"; Zhao Tongshan, the greatest \\"flowery\\" actor of the time; the \\"martial clown\\" Ye Shengzhang; the \\"educated clown\\" Ma Fulu; the \\"painted face\\" actor Jin Shaoshan; the \\"martial\\" actor Li Shaochun; the \\"Four Great Beards\\" Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Yang Baosen, and Xi Xiaobo; and the other \\"old men\\" Zhou Xinfang and Tang Yunsheng. She also studied under the female impersonators Yu Lianquan and Cheng Yanqiu. The broad range of specialists expanded her repertoire greatly. During this period, Li gave successful performances of The Dragon and the Phoenix, The Courtyard of the Black Dragon, Two Phoenixes Flying Together, and Three Pretty Women. Her career and finances were largely handled by her mother, who was reckoned one of the \\"Four Famous Mothers\\" of the opera. She had her first daughter Li Li in 1944. Li's mistreatment at the hands of the Japanese and Nationalists led her to \\"wholeheartedly\\" support the people's republic founded by the victorious Communists in 1949. Her success despite her poverty, lack of family connections, and avoidance of a rich and powerful patron gave her a clean slate and she was relatively young and famous. Many important cadres, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, and He Long, were fans of Peking opera and made special efforts to cultivate it. During the Communist Theatre Reform begun in 1949, Li was selected as a \\"people's artist\\", despite many of the \\"flowery\\" plays she had trained for being removed from the stage on account of their lack of ideological significance, violence, and sexuality. She performed extensively within China and even toured the Soviet Union and Europe multiple times. Her second daughter Li Ruru was born in 1952. The same year, she was resting in her dressing room in Wuhan when soldiers appeared to demand she cease her performances of Cheng Yanqiu's Spring Boudoir Dream. Amid the Korean War, they thought the dramatisation of a Tang-era poem by Du Fu was completely inappropriate and supported American imperialism. Baffled but scared, she complied and didn't perform it again until the 1980s, when the opposition to Cheng's pacifist themes was long past. Li was then drafted to perform revised versions of traditional plays for Chinese troops in Korea. Her favourite play was The Drunken Imperial Concubine, an account of a night in the life of Yang Guifei during the Tang dynasty. Li performed various roles in it around 200 times, from a bit part at age 11 to the lead in 1993 at age 70. Though it has a minimal story, she appreciated that it was full of dance and movement showing \\"every phase of the heroine's changing feelings: from sober to drunk, from arrogant and joyful to disappointed to sad to furious\\". This had been recommended for censorship as a \\"harmful\\" play by a 1948 People's Daily editorial, Mei Lanfang worked to sanitize the play and was permitted to perform it to the Chinese troops in Korea in 1953. Not all of the censorship came from the government. She later told her daughter Ruru that \\"the 'mind re- moulding' was so powerful that the ideology permeated into us. It seemed as if we had a censor in our minds and we voluntarily gave up many plays, which were not on the banning list, because we felt they did not reach the ideological standard that we had learned... and they would not be good for our audiences\\". In retrospect, she felt ashamed at the lost heritage: \\"I don't know what I can say to my predecessors when I see them in the other world\\". In 1953, Li became part of the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe, which was combined with several other troupes in 1955 to form the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre. Having \\"successfully adapted to the contemporary political climate\\", she began to earn a monthly salary of more than . and to enjoy much better social status than in pre-war China. The troupe included Tong Zhiling and Yan Huizhu. In the 1950s, Li expanded a one-act scene from the play Princess Baihua into a full Peking opera.. She and her colleagues were planning to adapt her version into a full-length play in 1960 when Chen Yi, China's foreign minister at the time, asked that they make a \\"fundamental change to the premise of the play in order to utilize it for China's Cold War diplomacy.\\" The play would go through \\"four versions between 1960 and 1961, which was further complicated by the volatile ideological pendulum of the era.\\" Along with Princess Baihua, other memorable performances were her 1958 Marriage Involving a Chest (Gui Zhong Yuan), 1959 Red Plum-Blossom Pavilion (Hongmei Ge), and 1961 Royal Concubine Mei (Mei Fei). = Incarceration = Since her school days, Li had supported certain revisions of the traditional Peking opera repertoire, particularly the removal of \\"pink scenes\\" with overt sexual content. The Theatre Reform did not ban many plays outright, but the reduction of traditional plays being produced caused her to worry about the loss of certain techniques with the passing of the older generation of performers. There was also call for more contemporary plays but Li's experience acting in four of them left her uncomfortable, as the playwrights made little accommodation for the conventions she had been trained to use: \\"I had nowhere to place my hands, I did not even know how to walk, or what to do on stage\\". The conventions she did use brought her severe criticism for \\"defam[ing] the image of members of the working class\\". Several times, she supported the idea of reserving older genres like Peking and Kun opera for their traditional canon and restricting contemporary plays to newer dramatic forms. At the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, her mother Li Yuxiu confronted a gang of Red Guards who were destroying statues in her house's courtyard. More than a dozen teenagers then forced themselves into the estate for a week, searching her belongings for old or counter-revolutionary items. When they discovered that she was a Manchu who had assumed a new identity after the fall of the Qing Empire, all her savings based on her daughter's income before 1949 were confiscated. She was then beaten so severely that she died from the injuries. Li Yuru was jailed in an \\"oxpen\\" and forced to write confessions of her \\"crimes\\" of \\"bourgeois thought and individualism demonstrated in striving for fame\\", of a \\"bourgeois lifestyle\\" demonstrated \\"in wearing make-up and fashionable clothes\\", and of participating in the \\"counter-revolutionary plays she performed on the stage\\". She was tortured. Her daughters became sent-down youth, relocated to and forced to labour in the countryside. Li was released in the early 1970s. = Later life = Li returned to the stage in 1977 and was permitted to headline a traditional opera in September the next year. She also mentored younger actresses and taught students in master classes and seminars. In December 1979, Li married Cao Yu, a Chinese dramatist now known as \\"the most significant figure in the development of modern drama in China. and sometimes compared to Shakespeare, Ibsen, and Chekhov. Being 14 years older, Cao often needed her care before his death in 1996. In the 1980s, Li began writing. She first produced a full-length play, Love and Hatred, based on Wang Kui's betrayal of Jiao Guiying. She wrote columns for the Xinmin Evening News and Wenhui Daily and, in 1992, serialised the novel Pinzi. This was republished under the title Little Woman the next year and adapted as a 20-episode television miniseries in 1999. She also published two books on Peking opera, both of which she wrote after her second operation for lung cancer in 2007. In 2007, Li was one of four recipients of the Great Achievement in Performing Arts award from the All-China Association of Literature and Arts, considered one of the \\"few living masters of the dan role\\". Li died on 11 July 2008 in Shanghai. Works * . * . * . * . Notes  References  =Citations= =Bibliography= * . * . * . * . * .

He was a pioneer in the trade, the industry and the tourism of the region of San Carlos of Bariloche.  Biography  He studied in the industrial school of his home town and loaned military service like pontonier, devoting since, to carpentry and construction.

He arrived to the zone of lake Nahuel Huapi, in April 1903, and installed himself in the lake Correntoso. There he devoted to carpentry and to the construction in wood, and was the constructor of the greater part of the first houses of San Carlos of Bariloche.

In the decade of 1920, almost all the economic and political activity of Bariloche went through Capraro, that was consul of Italy in the region, member of the Municipality, representative of several banks and insurance company, in addition to YPF. The crisis of 1930 left it to the edge of the ruin, and the elections of this year deprived it of the absolute control of the local politics that had exerted until then.

The racetrack is located on the grounds of the former Kraftwerk Meppen-Hüntel energy plant. The first event will be run on 16 June 2016. History Dutch entrepreneur Hennie van der Most bought 60 hectare of the former Kraftwerk Meppen-Hüntel power plant in 2004, four years after its closure. Van der Most planned to build an automotive theme park with a racetrack. The opening was scheduled for 2009. If the park was not opened in 2009 the Emsland municipality could claim €1,286,000 from Van der Most. Initially the opening was scheduled in the first half of 2008. However, the Financial crisis of 2007–08 halted construction in August 2008. The first races of the BRL V6 and BRL Light which were scheduled in 2009, had to be rescheduled. Van der Most reached an agreement with the municipality to postpone the opening of the Funpark to 2015. In 2014, 20 acres of the Funpark Meppen were bought by Harry Maessen, owner of Raceway Venray, to develop the racing circuit. The new configuration would include a racetrack, as well as a 1 kilometer and a 400-meter oval track. In July 2015 the track was paved and races for 2016 were announced. Two months later, the first cars were taken to the track to test the new layout. In February 2016 it was announced that the Touring Car Endurance Series would host a 12-hour endurance race, 12H Meppen, at the German track.. Due to the installation of noise monitoring equipment at Race Park Meppen, and by too few participant, CREVENTIC and Race Park Meppen have jointly decided to postpone the 2016 Hankook 12H MEPPEN, a twelve-hour race for touring cars, scheduled for September 23-24, 2016, to a date that will be announced in due course.

The \\"elbow\\" is indicated by the red circle. The number of clusters chosen should therefore be 4. In cluster analysis, the elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use. The same method can be used to choose the number of parameters in other data-driven models, such as the number of principal components to describe a data set. The method can be traced to speculation by Robert L. Thorndike in 1953.  Intuition  Using the \\"elbow\\" or \\"knee of a curve\\" as a cutoff point is a common heuristic in mathematical optimization to choose a point where diminishing returns are no longer worth the additional cost. In clustering, this means one should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster doesn't give much better modeling of the data. The intuition is that increasing the number of clusters will naturally improve the fit (explain more of the variation), since there are more parameters (more clusters) to use, but that at some point this is over-fitting, and the elbow reflects this. For example, given data that actually consist of k labeled groups – for example, k points sampled with noise – clustering with more than k clusters will \\"explain\\" more of the variation (since it can use smaller, tighter clusters), but this is over-fitting, since it is subdividing the labeled groups into multiple clusters. The idea is that the first clusters will add much information (explain a lot of variation), since the data actually consist of that many groups (so these clusters are necessary), but once the number of clusters exceeds the actual number of groups in the data, the added information will drop sharply, because it is just subdividing the actual groups. Assuming this happens, there will be a sharp elbow in the graph of explained variation versus clusters: increasing rapidly up to k (under- fitting region), and then increasing slowly after k (over-fitting region). In practice there may not be a sharp elbow, and as a heuristic method, such an \\"elbow\\" cannot always be unambiguously identified.See, e.g.,  Measures of variation  There are various measures of \\"explained variation\\" used in the elbow method. Most commonly, variation is quantified by variance, and the ratio used is the ratio of between-group variance to the total variance. Alternatively, one uses the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance, which is the one-way ANOVA F-test statistic.See, e.g., Figure 6 in *  See also  * Determining the number of clusters in a data set  References  Category:Clustering criteria ","title":"Elbow method (clustering)"},{"id":"50479694","text":"The Louis J.

Developed in the mid-19th century, it resembles a typical detached Vermont hillside farm complex, a contrast to the farms found further south on the valley floor of Otter Creek in southern Wallingford. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Homer Waldo Farm stands on the west side of Waldo Lane, a former alignment of Wallingford's main north-south road (now bypassed by the current alignment of United States Route 7), just south of Wallingford's village center and across Otter Creek. The farm complex includes a house, horse barn, and two dairy barns, all dating to the mid-19th century, and an early 20th- century milkhouse. The house is a 1-1/2 story frame building, that is basically vernacular in style, with ornamentation limited to a transom panel, architrave and cornice, set above the entrance. The modest styling is in contrast to some of the more elaborate farmhouses found further south in the Otter River valley. The farmhouse was built about 1840 by an unknown farmer. Its first documented owner was Alfred Hull, who sold the farm to Homer Waldo in 1866. The farm was owned by the Waldos for about 50 years, and was owned for much of the 20th century by the Davenport family, who owned the adjacent farm to the south and ran a dairy operation.

Background Forte was born on March 31, 1949, in Birmingham, Alabama to Leavy II and Helen (Demand) Forte. He and his family relocated to Emeryville, California in 1959. Later, the family moved to Oakland, California where Forte attended Oakland Tech High School. He had two brothers, Sherwin and Leavy III. He had one daughter, Marcella Anne Forte, three grandsons, Anthony Narcisse, Dione and Darrell Narcisse, one niece, Tosha Forte, and one nephew, Leavy Forte IV. = Ancestors = Census records from the 1900s show that Reggie's forefather was one of three brothers, Caze, Washington, and Preston Forte. They owned their own land in a town called Eufaula, Alabama. Each brother raised 11 children. They lived as a \\"clan\\" to protect each other from the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). One of Forte's forefathers seized the opportunity to emigrate to Liberia with his family. In 1868, Willis Forte sailed on the Golconda, with his wife Paulina, son Wiley, daughter Catherine, and another son Charles. Later, as Wiley took a wife, he established a town called Forteville that still thrives today. An incident arose in the 1930s between the Ku Klux Klan and the family. The story is documented in the book Witness to Injustice by David Frost, Jr. One of the Forte men went to town and had a fight with a white man. A knife was involved and both men were injured. When Forte made it home to Eufaula, the women and children moved into the woods for protection, while the men prepared for a fight. The next day a group of klansmen came to seek revenge at the Forte compound. They stopped at a country store to load up on supplies. When asked by the store owner where they were headed, the Klan leader said, \\"to get those Forte's.\\" The proprietor told them they'd need a lot more ammunition and supplies and a lunch because they were going to be gone for a long time. He explained that some of the Forte's could shoot the leaves off of trees from one hundred yards, and they would be ready to fight. The Klan reconsidered and went home. Joining the Panthers In 1963, Reginald's maternal step- grandmother was a victim of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham. She survived, but never fully recovered from her wounds. While in high school, Reginald met Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton and with his older brother Sherwin, joined them to patrol neighbourhoods in Richmond, Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco to monitor the police. They often followed the arrested to the police department, and would frequently pay their bail. The Panthers always (legally) displayed their weapons publicly. In 1967, Reginald, Sherwin, Lil' Bobbie Hutton, Big Man, Bobby Seale and others went to Sacramento, California's state capitol, to introduce their Ten Point Platform and to demonstrate their opposition to a law that made it illegal to bear firearms in public.

In the 17th century, this tomb was destroyed. During the reign of Karim Khan was built a mausoleum of two floors of brick and plaster, flanked by two rooms. The current building was built between 1950 and 1952 to a design by the architect Mohsen Foroughi and is inspired by the Chehel Sotoun with a fusion of old and new architectural elements. Around the tomb on the walls are seven verses of Saadi’s poems.

Biography  A worker's son, he began acting at age 10 and played the roles of children in several plays. He was danser at the Théâtre Monthabor, but he had only little success. So he stopped as a danser, and took a job as an apprentice in a bookshop. There he saw other starting authors like M.Champfleury. Masson liked reading books, and he started writing too. But he did not like the commercial side of his job. He worked a time as a café waiter. Masson started writing articles for newspapers, the quality of his work was recognized, and articles of his hand were published in newspapers like Les Nouveautés, the Mercure de France and La Lorgnette. (journal des théâtres, de la littérature, des arts, des moeurs, des modes et de la librairie, pour Paris, les départemens et l'étranger)catalogue.bnf.fr La Lorgnette : journal des théâtresgallica/bnf.fr La Lorgnette : journal des théâtres He was asked to join the redaction of Le Figaro, where he collaborated until 1831. His plays were presented on several Parisian stages of the 19th century, including the Théâtre du Vaudeville, the Théâtre des Variétés, the Théâtre des Nouveautés, the Théâtre du Gymnase, the Théâtre du Palais-Royal, and the Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin. Masson was the name of his mother: Nicole Agnès Masson.1862 edition, Les Contes de l'Atelier, Paris, Librairie de l. Hachette et Co.: Hommage respectueux a la chère memoire de Nicole Agnès Masson, Ma mère He also wrote under the pseudonym Michel Raymond, when working with Raymond Brucker, and authored, among others, several novels, including some for children. Long before he started writing for theater, Michel Masson had established his reputation as a writer of novels. His roman debut was received with high praise by the critics. It was written in cooperation with Raymond Brucker, Le Maçon (1829, 4 vol. in-12) and published under the pseudonym Michel Raymond. The merger of both their first names. But in those days Brucker also worked with the less known Léon Gozlan on another book: Les Intimes. And riding on the success of Le Maçon Brucker also used the name Michel Raymond for this book. Michel Masson made no objections to this, but thereupon he ended any cooperation with Brucker. To take advantage of the pseudonym himself, Michel first published two volumes of Daniel, le Lapidaire, ou les Contes de l'Atelier (1832-1833) also under the name Michel Raymond. They had a great success, and vol 3 and 4 he published under his own name: Michel Masson. Most the stories of this bundle were later edited for the theatre.P. Larousse, Dictionnaire du XIX Siècle, Tome 10, L-MEM, 1873, KB Den Haag, LZ Ency. 15.LAG. On 18 February 1824, Michel Masson married Françoise Deliége. Of this marriage 5 children were born, but only one survived. After a 47-year long marriage Françoise died February 1871. Shortly after this, April 1873, Michel Masson remarried with Clémence Hadingue, the daughter of an actress, and at the age of 74, he was again a father. Reason enough for Mr. Hippolyte Masson - the son from his first marriage - to start a lawsuit in which he claimed, as heir of his mother, his legacy. (Mostly the money he expected of all the books and other publications of his father) The verdict was in favor of the son.gallica.bnf.fr Le Rappel 16 January 1878 His 1834 novel \\"Un Cœur d'une Jeune Fille\\" drew the ire of Edgar Allan Poe, who attacked it for being too 'suggestive' in the \\"Democratic Review\\" (1844, vol.17 issue 78, pg 583).

Victim background Jisha, a 29-year-old law student at the Government Law College, Ernakulam, was found murdered on 28 April 2016 at her home near a canal in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam. She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. She was living with her mother who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu, separated from the family was staying alone and found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes. Police was puzzled in the initial stage with the paranoid mother, a daily wage worker and the dysfunctional family, they also had no close contacts/cordial relationship with the neighbors or relatives, this affected the case's progress initially among other factors. Murder The police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to disembowel her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Allappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death. According to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching. Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder. Case impact The crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a woman brutally murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha) used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha. The government has declared to offer a financial consolation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case. Arrest of murderer Through continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A citizen hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator. Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement, a friend of Ameerul Islam who have fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest. Sentencing and aftermath For premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually life imprisonment or death sentence. The case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate gender equity, lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate yellow journalism in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner.http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2017/12/13/beastly- brutality-on-jisha-s-body-led-cops-to-migrant-laborer-am.html The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court, in December 2017, awarded death penalty to Ameer ul-Islam, the sole accused in the case. He was also awarded life term, and rigorous imprisonment of 10 and 7 years.

It sets the rules of the organization and membership of the party. According to the Charter, the WPK Congress is the highest body of the party and it, along with the WPK Conference, can amend the Charter. The Charter defines the character, task, and methodology of the party. According to it, the Party strives to impose communism on the whole of the Korean Peninsula. Recent revisions of the Charter have defined Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism as the ideology of the party. The first Charter was adopted on 30 August 1946 at the 1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea, the immediate predecessor of the modern WPK. Since then, every Conference and some Congresses have revised the rules, most recently the 7th Congress in 2016. Since the death of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's accession to the leadership of the country, the Charter has not been adhered to by the party. After the 6th Congress in 1980, Congresses were no longer held every five years as stipulated by the Charter. Neither were plenums of the Central Committee held at regular six month intervals. Kim Jong-il was also elected General Secretary of the party without observing the correct procedure. In preparation of Kim Jong-un's succession, the 3rd Conference in 2010 revised the Charter to ensure that he would secure leadership in both the party and the army at the same time. Changes were also made to allow the Kim dynasty to pick a dates for Congresses freely. Such a Congress, 7th party Congress, amended the Charter by giving Kim Jong-un the title Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea in May 2016. Purpose The Charter, commonly known as the \\"Rules and Constitution\\", contains the party's by-laws. The Charter outlines the character, task and methodology of the Worker's Party. It sets communism across the whole Korean Peninsula as the goal of the party. According to the Charter, the party \\"represents the interests of the Korean nation and people\\", and its immediate task is \\"to attain a perfect victory of socialism in the northern part and to complete the revolutionary tasks of achieving national liberation and the people's democracy through the country.\\" This task is to be achieved by \\"perform[ing] the revolution and construction tasks under the sole leader's exclusive guidance, applying his revolutionary ideology as [the] guideline\\". The Charter stipulates that the party guides all state and social organs in North Korea. The Charter sets the rules on the organization of the party and its membership. It stipulates that the Congress is the highest body of the party. The Charter says that when the Congress is not in session, the party is run by the Central Committee. According to the Charter, the Central Committee elects the Chairman of the party, members of the Politburo, its Presidium, the Executive Policy Bureau, members of the Control Commission, and members of the Central Military Commission (CMC). The Charter can be amended by a Congress or a Conference of the party. The Control Commission theoretically probes suspected violations of the Charter by party members. However, the Charter is, in fact, an essentially meaningless document for much of its existence, since there is no oversight of central-level compliance. Implementation Although the Charter is the party's highest document de jure, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il breached party protocol during their rule by not convening party Congresses or Central Committee plenums. The Central Committee is not a permanent body; it must convene, according to the party's Charter, at least once every six months. The Central Committee is, according to the party's Charter, elected by delegates to a party congress; in practice, however, this has not been the case. According to Article 27 of the Charter, the Central Military Commission (CMC) is the highest party body in military affairs; it commands the Korean People's Army, developing and guiding its weaponry. In practice, however, the CMC is a ceremonial body subordinate to the National Defence Commission. A 1982 amendment to the Charter is believed to have made the CMC equal to the Central Committee, enabling it (among other things) to elect the party leader. Although the party Charter specifies that the Politburo should meet at least once a month, there is little evidence that this has actually happened. History The first Charter was adopted on 30 August 1946 in the 1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea, the immediate predecessor of the present WPK. The 2nd Congress revised it on 30 March 1948, and the 3rd Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea made extensive revisions to it in April 1956. The 4th Congress amended it on 18 September 1961, and the 5th Congress on 13 November 1970. The 6th Congress revised it on 10 October 1980. The 1990s (especially after Kim Il-sung's death) began a period in which any pretense of following the Charter was dropped. No Central Committee plenums were convened between 1993 and 2010, even though the Charter mandated one to be held at least every six months. As consequence, the composition of the CC at that time remained only an estimate. It was not known which members of the 6th CC were active or even alive. In a clear breach of the Charter, Kim Jong-il was appointed WPK General Secretary in a joint announcement by the 6th Central Committee and the CMC rather than elected by a plenum of the Central Committee. =3rd party Conference= On 26 June 2010 the Politburo announced that it was summoning delegates for the 3rd party Conference, with its official explanation the need to \\"reflect the demands of the revolutionary development of the Party, which is facing critical changes in bringing about the strong and prosperous state and chuche [Juche] development.\\" The Conference met on 28 September, revising the party Charter and electing (and dismissing) members of the Central Committee, the Secretariat, the Politburo, the Presidium and other bodies. The WPK's ultimate goal was changed from \\"build[ing] a communist society\\" (although Marxism–Leninism was still mentioned) to \\"embody[ing] the revolutionary cause of Juche in the entire society\\". The Charter was revised at the 3rd Conference (its first revision since the 6th Congress in 1980) to require the party's First Secretary to also hold the office of Chairman of the party's Central Military Commission. This was to ensure Kim Jong-un's succession of his father, Kim Jong-il, by guaranteeing that he inherits the top posts in not just the party but the army as well. Although a congress was formerly mandated to be convened every five years, the 3rd Conference revised the party Charter to state that the Central Committee could convene a congress as desired with six months' notice to the party. This, too, was done in preparation for Kim Jong-un's succession, allowing the Kim dynasty to pick the date freely. Two new chapters were added: \\"The Party and the People's Power\\" and \\"The Party Logo and Flag of Party\\". =4th party Conference= Ideology was elaborated at the in 2012, when Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism became \\"the only guiding idea of the party\\" in the Charter. =7th party Congress= At the 7th party Congress on 9 May 2016, the charter was amended \\"as required by the developing reality.\\" The dual-track policy of pursuing both economic growth and nuclear weapons capacity was added to the Charter. Secretary titles were made Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen in both the central and municipal levels. The Secretariat was named the Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea. The First Secretary of the party became Chairman of the Workers' Party.

She won the Israeli Prime Minister's prize in 2015.Sarah Blau in the institute of translation of Hebrew literature http://www.ithl.org.il/page_14987 , and the 2017 Bar-Ilan University Alumni Achievement Award.  Biography  Blau was born in Bnei Brak (a religious city which appears frequently in her work), the oldest daughter of a Religious Zionist family. She is considered a prominent voice in religious Israeli literature, and identifies herself as ‘religious-lite.’ She served as editor and presenter on various television and radio shows that focus on Jewish topics from an original, feminist perspective and also hosted a weekly TV show in which she discussed biblical figures with children. Single and childfree, she was quoted as saying, “I wrote an entire thriller to understand why it works for me.” As part of her Sherut Leumi (National service) she volunteered in The Hedva Ibshitz Centre for the Study of the Holocaust, where she worked as a guide and documented Holocaust survivors. In 1999 she initiated the alternative Yom HaShoa (Holocaust remembrance day) ceremonies. In the first years the alternative ceremonies took place in Tel Aviv and raised controversy, but later became widespread throughout Israel. The ceremonies focused on remembrance from a personal and social perspective of the participants. Some of the participants were Shimon Adaf, Erel Segal, Muki, Gideon Levy, and Daniel Salomon. Blau referred to these ceremonies as \\"the second floor\\" of memory, and said: \\"they are not meant to replace the existing ceremonies, but to add on them. Deal with the present in light of the past. Deal with the years that passed since then, and in the relevancy of the past to our lives today. Every generation has its own methods for remembrance, and those do not necessarily go through grief alone.\\"  Literary work  In Blau’s fiction, ancient Jewish myths serve as springboards for ironic reexamination and reinvention. She is the author of three novels, several plays and short stories published in various anthologies in Israel and abroad. Blau's debut novel, \\"The Book of Creation\\" (, 2007), concerns a lonely woman who can't find a spouse so she creates a man shaped Golem. Her second book, \\"Those Well-Raised Girls\\", (, 2012) combines dark suspense with a tale of sexual awakening. At a religious high school for girls, a 17-year-old student is preparing a play based on the story of The 93 Girls, Jewish girls from Krakow who committed suicide to avoid rape (a story once believed to true, but now is considered a myth). Her third book, \\"Stake\\", (, 2014), was written while Blau was performing her one-woman show, \\"Thy Shall Write\\". In the show, a heart broken novelist is working on a modern version of the story of Jael, the biblical heroine who killed Sisera to deliver the Israelites.Sarah Blau in Jerusalem's Writers Festival http://mishkenot.org.il/writersfestival/en/participant/sarah-blau/ In 2015 Blau was one of the winners of the Israeli Prime Minister's prize for Hebrew literature. The judges praised Blau for a daring, nonconformist style, that is at the same time connected to tradition and religious life.

The station was owned by Doxa Communications, Inc. WNKJ-TV's studios were originally located at 1100 East 18th Street in downtown Hopkinsville. History The station signed on the air as an independent station in October 1983. Except for W64BR (later W64AV), a low-powered translator of Kentucky Educational Television (KET) affiliate WKMA-TV of Madisonville, it was the first television station ever to sign on in the Hopkinsville area. W43AG, which at the time was under ownership of the Kentucky New Era newspaper, signed on the air more than one month later. Hopkinsville was and still is considered to be in the Nashville, Tennessee media market, and only the Nashville area's big three television stations (e.g. WKRN, WSMV and WTVF), along with Madisonville-based WLCN (later WB/CW affiliate WAZE-TV), provided the best-quality signal coverage at the time of WNKJ's existence. ABC affiliate WBKO in Bowling Green, Kentucky had also been providing at least Grade B signal coverage in the Christian County area as Hopkinsville was as far west as that signal can reach. The station's programming lineup consisted of religious programs, old sitcoms, a few movies and cartoons in barter syndication. In spite of a powerful terrestrial signal with 254,700 watts effective radiated power, due to poor viewership, the station went dark in 1985. The station's broadcast license was returned to the FCC in 1986. This made W43AG (later WKAG-CA) the sole locally based television station in Hopkinsville until it went off the air in 2011. =Post- existence= In the early 1990s, another television station was also slated to go on the air on UHF channel 51 under a different licensee, with the callsign of WKKT-TV.

The book explores mestizo cultural identity. The protagonist Romero y Flores is conflicted between identifying with either his father's Spanish descent or his mother's Amerindian origins. He finds the tranquility he has been searching for once he attains a balance of identity. The book has been translated into many languages, including Czech, German, French, among others. The book has not yet been translated into English. Criticism While Icaza's 1934 novel Huasipungo (English trans: The Villagers, 1964) is his most famous work, many literary experts, such as Theodore Alan Sackett in El arte en la novelística de Jorge Icaza (1974), have hailed El chulla Romero y Flores as his masterpiece. Chulla meaning A chulla is a middle class man or woman of mixed European and Amerindian descent who scorns his Amerindian side while exalting his European side.

Warren Air Force Base and equipped with LGM-30G Minuteman III Missiles. It has served at Warren as a component of Strategic Air Command, Air Combat Command, Air Force Space Command and Air Force Global Strike Command since 1963. The wing was first organized at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington as the 90th Bombardment Wing, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit. After moving to Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, it served as a training unit for Strategic Air Command units and aircrews in the B-29. In 1953 it converted to the strategic reconnaissance mission, upgrading to the Boeing RB-47 Stratojet in 1954. After 1958 it trained reconnaissance crews with the B-47 and continued that mission until it was inactivated in 1960. Mission The wing operates 150 LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles on full alert 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Its missiles are dispersed in hardened silos to protect against attack and connected to underground missile alert facilities through a system of hardened cables. Organization The 90th Missile Wing is made up of a wing staff and five groups: The 90th Operations Group is composed of three missile squadrons, an operations support squadron and a standardization and evaluation element. Each missile squadron is responsible for five missile alert facilities and 50 Minuteman III ICBMs. Its units include the 319th, 320th and 321st Missile Squadrons and the 90th Operations Support Squadron. The 90th Maintenance Group maintains 150 missiles and associated launch facilities, as well as 15 launch control facilities spread between a three-state, 9,600 square-mile complex. It is composed of the 90th Missile Maintenance Squadron and the 90th Maintenance Operations Squadron and a Maintenance Quality Assurance Section. The 90th Mission Support Group provides civil engineering, transportation and logistics, communications, contracting, and personnel and services support to the wing and tenant units. The units of the 90th Mission Support Group include the 90th Civil Engineer Squadron, 90th Logistics Readiness Squadron, 90th Communications Squadron, 90th Contracting Squadron, and the 90th Force Support Squadron. The 90th Security Forces Group is composed of five squadrons. The 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron provides security for convoys and missile maintenance operations. The 90th Ground Combat Training Squadron is located at Camp Guernsey in Guernsey, Wyo., and provides security, pre-deployment, and antiterrorism and force protection training for USAF personnel. The 90th Missile Security Forces Squadron provides security for 15 missile alert facilities and 150 launch facilities. The 90th Security Forces Squadron provides installation and weapons storage area security; police services; pass and registration functions; and reports and analysis duties. The 90th Security Support Squadron provides command and control for the missile field and access control for all missile field forces as well as all security forces training and equipment support. The 90th Medical Group is responsible for medical and dental care for more than 17,000 beneficiaries throughout Wyoming, Nebraska and northern Colorado.

History =Superfortress operations= Wing Boeing B-29Aircraft is Boeing B-29-100-BW Superfortress serial 45-21846 The wing was first organized at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington in January 1951 as the 90th Bombardment Wing and equipped with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. While organizing, it was attached to the 92d Bombardment Wing, whose commander also served as the commander of the 90th Wing. In February, as part of a reorganization of Strategic Air Command wings, the 90th Wing's 90th Bombardment Group was reduced to paper status and its squadrons were attached to the wing for operational control. In June 1952, this organization, which was designed to permit the wing commander to focus on the wing's combat units and the maintenance necessary to support combat aircraft, was formalized as the Dual Deputy Organization and the group was inactivated and its squadrons were assigned to the wing.Deaile, pp. 175–176 In March 1951, the wing moved to Forbes Air Force Base, where it served primarily as a training unit. In May, it began serving as an Operational Training Unit for B-29 aircrews and mechanics of newly-activating units. The 376th Bombardment Wing was the first new Superfortress wing trained by the 90th, activating on 1 June 1951. In October, it was combat ready and moved to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, its permanent base.Ravenstein, pp. 200–202 The day the 376th Wing departed, the 308th Bombardment Wing was activated and began its training, which lasted until it moved to Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia in April 1952. The 310th Bombardment Wing was the last B-29 unit trained at Forbes. With its departure for Schilling Air Force Base, Kansas in September 1952, the B-29 operational training mission ended. In June, the wing added duty as a Replacement Training Unit, primarily providing individual training for aircrew being assigned to existing Far East Air Forces B-29 units during the Korean War.Replacement Training Units trained individuals to fill positions in existing units. See Goss, p. xxxvi In November 1952 it also began training replacement crews for the RB-29 reconnaissance model of the Superfortress and SHORAN personnel for Strategic Air Command (SAC). These training activities continued through November 1953. =Strategic reconnaissance= B-47 and KC-97 as flown by the wing The wing began to fly strategic reconnaissance missions in September 1953. The following year, it replaced its RB-29s with the jet Boeing RB-47 Stratojet, with the first B-47E arriving on 25 June, although crews had begun training in March.90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, pp. 3, 15 One year later, the wing deployed as a unit to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska from 5 May until 31 August 1955, where it performed the final mapping of Alaska.90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, p. 15 With the assignment of the 90th Air Refueling Squadron in 1955, the wing began to fly air refueling missions as well as reconnaissance flights. In May 1958, the wing returned to the training mission serving as a combat crew training wing for RB-47 aircrews until it was inactivated on 20 June 1960. The wing's personnel and equipment were transferred to the 40th Bombardment Wing, which moved to Forbes on paper from Schilling Air Force Base, Kansas the same day.Ravenstein, p. 68 The 90th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned to the 40th Wing upon that wing's arrival at Forbes. =Strategic missiles= The wing was again organized in July 1963 at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming as the 90th Strategic Missile Wing. The LGM-30B Minuteman I missiles of the wing would replace the SM-65 Atlas missiles of the inactivating 389th Strategic Missile Wing. The replacement Minutemen would be more widely displaced and hardened than the Atlases they replaced.Mueller, pp. 184–185 Initially, the wing supervised missile facility construction until July 1964, with its individual squadrons activating between October 1963 and July 1964 as missile launch facilities became operational. The wing was initially equipped with 200 LGM-30B Minuteman I, equipped with a single reentry vehicle. Beginning in June 1973, the Minuteman I missiles began to be replaced by LGM-30G Minuteman IIIs, which could carry up to three reentry vehicles, with the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron becoming the first Minuteman III squadron in the wing.90th Missile Wing Heritage Pamphlet, p. 4 The changeout was completed by October 1974. However, in 2001 and in compliance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, these missiles were limited to a single reentry vehicle The wing supervised LGM-118 Peacekeeper personnel training and facility preparation beginning Jun 1985. The Peacekeeper, which could carry ten independently targeted reentry vehicles, was fully operational with the wing's 400th Strategic Missile Squadron on 30 December 1986. The Peacekeeper system continued in operation in addition to the wing's Minuteman missiles until September 2005, when it was retired and the 400th Squadron inactivated. Although it remained a component of Twentieth Air Force, starting in 1992, the wing saw a series of changes in the major command it was art of. When SAC was inactivated on 1 June 1992, the wing, along with its other combat missile units, became part of Air Combat Command. On 1 July 1993, after being redesignated as the 90th Space Wing, and with the idea to take advantage of the similarities between the missile and other space missions, the wing became part of Air Force Space Command. On 1 December 2009, the wing and other missile wings were reunited with the global bomber force under Air Force Global Strike Command.

The resort is located on of land at 300 West Sahara Avenue, near the Las Vegas Strip. The Ahern Hotel is adjacent to the Allure Las Vegas high-rise condominium, opened in 2008 by developer Andrew Fonfa. The resort's property was once planned as the site of a second Allure tower, which was cancelled due to poor economic conditions. While selling units in the first tower, Fonfa decided to build a hotel and casino on the adjacent site. The Lucky Dragon was designed by Ed Vance & Associates Architects and was announced in February 2012, with groundbreaking in May 2015. The resort had a soft opening on November 19, 2016. An official grand opening was held on December 3, 2016. The Lucky Dragon was heavily inspired by Asian concepts in an effort to appeal to Asian customers, who were expected to be the resort's primary customer base. With 203 rooms and a casino, the Lucky Dragon was considered small in comparison to nearby competitors on the Las Vegas Strip. After experiencing low customer turnout, the Lucky Dragon's casino and restaurants were temporarily closed in January 2018 so the property could reorganize, while the hotel remained open. The hotel subsequently closed on October 2, 2018. It was sold in April 2019, to Don Ahern, who reopened the hotel later that year as Ahern Hotel. Ahern also planned to convert the casino into conference and convention space. History =Original plans= The resort is located on of land at 300 West Sahara Avenue, a block west of the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, an area that had become known for a number of vacant lots, older resorts, and failed projects. The property is located between the Golden Steer restaurant and the Allure Las Vegas condominium high-rise tower. Developer Andrew Fonfa had initially purchased the property as part of a five-acre parcel in 1987. At the time, Fonfa planned to build a hotel on the property, as he expected Circus Circus Enterprises to construct the Excalibur Hotel and Casino nearby, thus increasing tourism for the northern Las Vegas Strip. The Excalibur was ultimately built at the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. In May 2002, Fonfa proposed the Hilton Garden Inn, an eight-story Hilton-branded 200-room hotel with an attached casino that would be located on the property's east side. Hilton considered Fonfa's property to be a desirable location for one of their hotels, and approached him about a possible deal, although discussions were still preliminary at the time of the project's announcement. Under the partnership, Fonfa would own the hotel and casino, while Hilton would manage the hotel and would have no involvement in the casino operations. Fonfa was in negotiations with GE Capital to finance the project, and hoped to begin construction at the end of the year, with completion scheduled in 15 months. Construction was expected to cost $50 million. Four small commercial buildings located on the property were to be torn down to make room for the new resort. Fonfa changed his mind about the hotel-casino project after speaking with Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman and several city officials, stating that high-rise condominiums \\"is what the city wanted as part of its plan for residential living.\\" In 2004, Fonfa was approved for plans to construct twin condominium towers on the property. The Allure tower was opened in early 2008. The site of the Lucky Dragon had initially been planned for the second Allure tower, which was later cancelled because of poor sales caused by the Great Recession, and because of an oversupply of condominium high-rises on the Las Vegas Strip. To help sell units in the first Allure tower, Fonfa said that in 2008, \\"We realized we were going to need cash buyers. We went to LA and San Francisco and Vancouver and San Jose and put ads in all the Chinese newspapers in those communities. And we were very pleased with what came back, which was over 100 units sold to Chinese buyers.\\" At that point, Fonfa then devised an idea to build a hotel and casino on the property originally planned for the second tower. In 2008, Fonfa and his sister, Gudren, revealed plans for a potential hotel-casino on the property adjacent to Allure. The $1.2 billion resort would be called Q, standing for \\"queer\\", and would cater to gay and lesbian people. The 45-story hotel would include 1,000 rooms, and would be managed by Wyndham. Fonfa did not formally announce the project as it was unclear when the American credit market would recover. The Lucky Dragon project was later announced for the property in February 2012, as a 10-story hotel tower with 201 rooms and an casino, with 478 slot machines and a 446-space parking garage. The hotel- casino would be developed by Fonfa, and an Asian theme was chosen for the project as it was being financed by Chinese investors. The Lucky Dragon was designed by Ed Vance & Associates Architects. =Construction and financing= The Lucky Dragon was built by Penta Building Group, which worked on the project with its development manager, Grand Canyon Development Partners. Both companies worked closely with city planning officials to re-categorize the property as a single parcel rather than as phase two of Allure. As part of the effort, several lots were sold to Lucky Dragon LLP in order to develop the resort. Groundbreaking on the Lucky Dragon began in May 2015, with the pouring of the resort's foundation. The boutique hotel would contain nine stories, while the casino was expected to contain two stories. Work crews faced difficulties in pouring the concrete due to the heat during the Las Vegas summer. To avoid the heat, several concrete pours were completed during early morning hours, which resulted in noisy equipment for nearby businesses and residents directly north of the property. Material deliveries to the construction site also resulted in inconveniences for local residents, who received gift cards as compensation for the disruptions. After the hotel's lower portion was complete, construction crews added an additional floor every week. The hotel tower was topped out on September 11, 2015. The casino and six-story parking garage were still under construction at that time, with the resort expected to open in summer 2016. The project was being financed by funds through the United States federal government's EB-5 program, which offered foreign investors the possibility of U.S. residency. On November 16, 2015, Fonfa and development partner William Weidner – the former president and chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands, and one of the Lucky Dragon's backers – requested approval for tax increment financing from the Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency, in order to receive a bank loan to continue construction on the project, which had already raised $60 million through the EB-5 program. On November 18, 2015, the Las Vegas City Council rejected Fonfa and Weidner's request for $25 million in subsidies to help finance the $139 million project, which was expected to open in August 2016. Approximately 3,600 jobs associated with the ongoing project were lost due to the decision. Work on the hotel's roof and parapet was expected to begin in December 2015. The following month, framing and drywall installation was underway, as well as the installation of the hotel's exterior curtain wall. The wall, designed by EV&A; Architects and installed by Giroux Glass, Inc., was made of ruby red glazing. The Lucky's Dragon's project manager, Paul Dutmer, said, \\"To get this particular color of red, we went through several dozen testing samples. Once the sun hits it, it will be a bright red that will be hard not to see.\\" The hotel tower was expected to be fully enclosed and waterproofed by the end of January 2016. In May 2016, it was announced that the project had received full financing from Fonfa and Weidner's families. Construction was approximately 70 percent complete at that time, with the resort expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2016. It was later reported that the project's financing was through a $90 million loan issued to Fonfa by Snow Covered Capital, which initially provided a $30 million loan for construction and a $15 million revolving loan. Snow Covered Capital was the primary lender in the project. Through the EB-5 program, 179 foreign investors each provided $500,000 for a total of $89.5 million. They also each paid a $50,000 administrative fee. The Lucky Dragon was planned to be the first Las Vegas resort to offer an \\"authentic Asian lifestyle experience.\\" James Weidner, the son of William, was the managing principal of the Lucky Dragon. James Weidner stated that he was partly inspired to join the project because of trips that he took with his father to China. James Weidner stated that the project \\"presented an opportunity to do something here [in Las Vegas] that really respects the culture directly and approaches the Asian market, which is really powerful.\\" Feng shui experts and design consultants were hired to ensure the entire resort had an authentic Asian appearance. David Jacoby, chief operating officer for the resort, said during construction that, \\"This whole place has been very specifically feng shui'd, from the color patterns, to the carpets, to where the seats are, to where the cash is. There will be no fourth floor in the hotel - that's a superstition similar to what we have in the United States with the number 13. There's no number 4 anywhere on the property. Our phone numbers don't have a 4 in it. People in the front of the house of the resort will speak Mandarin, Cantonese and other Asian dialects. Signage is in Chinese first, English second. What we're trying to do is build an authentic cultural experience from the ground-up for Asian clientele, both locally and regionally throughout the United States.\\" The resort's granite sidewalks were designed to imitate dragon scales. Ahead of its opening, Fonfa described the Lucky Dragon as a locals casino that would primarily rely on local Asian residents as its clientele, as well as Asian tourists from China and California. Fonfa expected local residents to account for 60 percent of the Lucky Dragon's customers. Las Vegas Weekly wrote that the Lucky Dragon, with its large focus on Asian customers, \\"might be the most specifically focused casino project in the history of Las Vegas.\\" =Opening= Lucky Dragon logo (2016–2018) The casino entrance in 2017 On September 6, 2016, company officials announced that the resort would open on December 3, 2016. Lucky Dragon was expected to employ more than 800 people. The resort had a soft opening at 8:00 p.m. on November 19, 2016, with its official grand opening still scheduled for December 3. The Lucky Dragon opened with 203 hotel rooms, including 22 suites. Each room included a wall mural designed to represent the \\"peace and tranquility of ancient China,\\" according to the hotel. The Lucky Dragon also featured a spa, while the casino offered popular Asian games such as baccarat, pai gow, and sic bo. The casino featured 37 table games and 300 slot machines, and was located in a two-story building that connected to the hotel tower through a bridge walkway. It was the first newly constructed hotel-casino to open in Las Vegas since The Cosmopolitan in 2010. The resort – considered small in comparison to nearby competitors – is connected to the adjacent Allure tower. The official grand opening took place on the afternoon of December 3, 2016, and was accompanied by a ribbon-cutting ceremony, costumed dancers dressed as Chinese lions and a dragon, and firecrackers. The first direct flights between Beijing and Las Vegas, launched a day before the Lucky Dragon's grand opening, were not expected to bring in additional customers to the resort, although officials welcomed the possibility. Fonfa envisioned some of the area around the Lucky Dragon possibly being redeveloped as a new Chinatown for Las Vegas over the next decade. The Lucky Dragon's centerpiece is a 1.25 ton dragon chandelier that hangs over a bar. Work on the chandelier began in May 2015, with nearly 800 people working on it until its completion. Installation of the chandelier was completed in November 2016, after two weeks. In February 2017, the resort planned to add an additional VIP gaming area due to the popularity of its VIP club. For its VIP members, the casino also introduced a rolling-chip program, a concept that was common in Macau. In March 2017, Midwest Pro Painting and Penta Building Group claimed in court that they were owed money for their work on the Lucky Dragon during construction. Midwest Pro Painting stated that it was owed $793,300, while Penta Building Group alleged that it only received approximately $76.4 million and was still owed approximately $7.4 million for construction work. Both companies ultimately agreed to dismiss their claims. =Financial difficulties and closure= Approximately 100 employees – including top managers, and bar and wait staff – had been fired by late March 2017, as the result of poor customer turnout. In response, the casino began offering nightly entertainment – including Jazz Saturdays, and karaoke on Mondays – later that year. In September 2017, a default notice was filed against the Lucky Dragon over its $90 million loan. The default notice was not publicly revealed at that time. According to lawyers for the Lucky Dragon, the property was appraised at $143 million in November 2017, although creditors stated that the property was actually appraised at $60 million. In December 2017, the Las Vegas Review-Journal visited the Lucky Dragon on several occasions and noted that the property appeared to be struggling, as its casino and restaurants were mostly empty of customers. The newspaper also interviewed local Chinese gamblers, who indicated that \\"the problem did not lie so much with Lucky Dragon's offering of entertainment or food as with its comparatively stingy gaming and comp policy.\\" General Manager Jordan Seager said that the Lucky Dragon's comp policy \\"is in line, or even more fair\\" than other Las Vegas casinos, stating that the Lucky Dragon simply needed time for its customers to develop a close relationship with the property. The Lucky Dragon was also considered to be in a poor location near the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, an area that was lacking in development and had little vehicle and pedestrian traffic. In addition, it faced competition from the nearby Palace Station and SLS resorts, which also targeted Asian clientele. Canadian investor Jason Chen signed a $400,000 deposit deal in December 2017 to lease the casino. Chen later sued Fonfa, Weidner and Seager, stating that they had not made him aware of the casino's financial difficulties. On the morning of January 4, 2018, the casino and restaurants were temporarily closed and the property announced plans to reorganize itself by hiring new firms to operate those aspects of the resort. At the time, the Lucky Dragon had more than 500 employees. The property stated, \\"While this is a difficult decision, this repositioning paves the way for Lucky Dragon to establish new partnerships that will enhance the property's long-term positioning and provide a better guest experience.\\" The casino was expected to reopen within six months. The hotel and a gift shop remained opened. Later that month, the Lucky Dragon's default status was publicly reported and notice of a foreclosure sale of the resort was filed with the county, with the foreclosure auction scheduled for February 6, 2018. At the time of the notice, Lucky Dragon owed $48.9 million on its $90 million loan. On the morning of the scheduled auction, it was delayed until February 22, 2018, as requested by the trustee: First American Title Insurance. On February 16, 2018, the Lucky Dragon entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy to preserve the jobs of its 98 employees, as well as to pay its creditors and to \\"provide certainty to the market,\\" according to court documents. Management believed that auctioning the Lucky Dragon through bankruptcy court would be the best way to preserve and maximize the value of the resort. During a bankruptcy hearing on February 21, 2018, a judge ruled that there would not be a foreclosure auction of the resort, and that the hotel would remain open until March 27, 2018, when another bankruptcy hearing would be held. The hotel remained open following the hearing date, with room prices falling to $35. As of May 2018, there were several prospective buyers, domestically and internationally, who were interested in the resort, which owed $308,103 in property taxes. The developers hoped to sell the property through bankruptcy court. However, Ryan Works, an attorney representing 118 of the project's EB-5 investors, said he would prefer a new investor rather than a sale, which he feared would wipe out the ownership stakes of his clients. Works stated that EB-5 investors spent the most money on the project and that none of them had received permanent U.S. residency. A judge approved bid procedures for the resort later that month, and Fonfa was in discussions with various investment groups, including some in Asia. Fonfa expected to choose a group by the end of June 2018, and his group planned to auction the resort on July 20, 2018. Fonfa did not specify if his group planned to sell its entire stake in the resort or simply partner with the other group. During July 2018, a letter of intent was signed between Fonfa's group and two companies – DeBartolo Development and Achieved Management – for a joint venture, at a bid price of $53 million. The bankruptcy auction was ultimately held on September 10, 2018. Fonfa's group had presented several prospective buyers, including Dotty's and The Meruelo Group, but Snow Covered Capital became the new owner of the land through a credit bid. Snow Covered Capital stated that the resort's operations \\"have been a dismal failure,\\" stating that the hotel had lost approximately $200,000 for each month during the bankruptcy case. Three days after the auction, lawyers for the resort filed a motion to close the hotel immediately and end payments to employees and vendors, with the closure intended to ensure an efficient transition of ownership to Snow Covered Capital. The hotel closure was approved by a U.S. Bankruptcy judge, and took effect on October 2, 2018, while a foreclosure auction was expected to take place at the end of the month. Prior to the auction, discussions had been held about eventually reopening the Lucky Dragon without casino space, which could be converted into meeting space or an Esports lounge. The foreclosure auction was held on October 30, 2018, with a minimum bid of $35 million. With no bids made, Snow Covered Capital retained ownership of the Lucky Dragon. In February 2019, 40 Chinese EB-5 investors sued Fonfa, Weidner, Jacoby, and several limited liability companies. The investors claimed that they were \\"fraudulently induced\\" by the developers to invest in the project. The investors had yet to receive U.S. residency and sought a refund of their investment. In April 2019, Snow Covered Capital sued Fonfa, Weidner and Jacoby, alleging that they were required to reimburse the company for the cost of purchasing the Lucky Dragon. =Ahern Hotel= Following the auction, the property received interest from numerous prospective buyers, although the listing broker stated that approximately 98 percent of them were \\"dreamers\\" with no realistic chance of closing on a purchase of the property. On April 22, 2019, the Lucky Dragon was sold for $36 million to Don Ahern, the chairman and CEO of a local construction-equipment firm. Ahern was among few prospective buyers who was financially capable of purchasing the property. Ahern intended to eventually reopen the hotel and convert the casino area into conference and convention space. He also planned to give the property a new name, which would be determined at a later date. In May 2019, Ahern announced plans to have the hotel reopened within 60 days, and to have the convention space opened around November. The opening was later delayed. It eventually reopened as the Ahern Hotel and Convention Center in late 2019, with redecorated rooms and new signage, while retaining the red exterior of its predecessor. Ahern marketed the property as an upscale boutique hotel. Chinese-themed statues were removed, and the dragon chandelier was sold to the Muckleshoot Indian Casino in Washington. Work to transform the casino into convention space was expected to begin in March 2020. Ahern estimated that he was spending less than $10 million on the changes, including new restaurants. He hoped the entire resort would be ready in time for a grand opening on July 4, 2020. However, the opening was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the state. Ahern later hoped to have the renovations finished in October 2020. During the pandemic, the hotel offered free meals to first responders. In August 2020, the hotel lobby hosted an evangelical event by Paula White, the personal pastor to Republican U.S. president Donald Trump. The event was part of Trump's re-election campaign, and it attracted hundreds of guests. This was an alleged violation of pandemic safety orders issued by Nevada governor Steve Sisolak, a Democrat. The orders prohibited gatherings of more than 50 people, and Sisolak criticized the event for going over the limit. The Ahern Hotel had been warned not to host the event, and was fined a $250 civil penalty for doing so. The Trump campaign and event organizers noted that Nevada hotels were allowed to operate at 50-percent capacity under Sisolak's order. The lobby had a maximum capacity of 1,600 people, and the event garnered 550 guests. Later in the same week, the hotel hosted the Mrs. Nevada pageant with 250 people. Las Vegas city officials and local police arrived to shut down the event over pandemic concerns, but they allowed it to resume after family members and audiences were removed from the premises. The hotel was not fined. Ahern is a Republican supporter, and the hotel's manager believed that the pageant shutdown was politically motivated as retaliation for the earlier Trump event. Previous events of similar size had been held at the hotel recently without issue. On August 24, 2020, the hotel filed a lawsuit against the city, the state, and Sisolak, challenging his COVID-19 orders. Two days later, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a fine of $10,930 to the hotel, citing four violations of Sisolak's orders during the Trump event and pageant. Restaurants In August 2016, officials announced a contest to create a name for the Lucky Dragon's night market restaurant – the resort's last unnamed eatery – with the winner receiving a weekend stay package. The Lucky Dragon featured five restaurants upon opening: * Dragon's Alley, a food court, featuring a lantern-lit space that was designed as a night market. Dragon's Alley featured a show kitchen known as Jewel Kitchen that extended onto the casino floor, allowing players to watch as the food is prepared. * Pearl's Ocean, a dim sum restaurant. * Phoenix, a 60-seat fine-dining restaurant. * Cha Garden, a 24-hour, indoor/outdoor tea garden and lounge, extending from the hotel lobby to the pool area. Cha Garden offered 50 different teas, and remained open after the closure of the other restaurants in January 2018. * Bao Now, a 24-hour eatery offering grab-and-go foods. Each restaurant offered only authentic Chinese food, which company officials expected to be the resort's primary advantage to bringing in customers. In February 2017, plans were announced for the temporary closure of Dragon's Alley so a noodle bar could be added. There were also plans to move Pearl's Ocean from the second floor to a larger space on the first floor, where it would occupy the dining area of Dragon's Alley. The casino's new VIP area was to occupy the space formerly used by Pearl's Ocean. Dragon's Alley closed some time in 2017. At the end of the year, prior to the closure of the Lucky Dragon's restaurants and casino, there had been plans to reopen Dragon's Alley as a different food and beverage business. The Ahern Hotel includes a restaurant called \\"Unknown\\" and an Italian restaurant called Chef Marc's.

The election attracted nationwide attention, as Christchurch was a Labour-stronghold and due to Acland's widespread popularity, it was regarded as a test whether Labour could potentially win the November 1935 general election. Background In 1935, the voting system returned to the initially used first-past-the-post after a ranked voting system had been tried for some years.

The youngest of John Acland's 11 children, he was a grandson of Christchurch's first bishop, Henry Harper. John Acland was a member of the Legislative Council for a third of a century. Just prior to the election, the engagement of his son Jack was announced to Kit Ormond; her family was equally prominent in New Zealand, and her grandfather, John Davies Ormond, had been Superintendent of Hawke's Bay Province. Hugh Acland was a prominent surgeon who served with the New Zealand Medical Corps during World War I. Acland was knighted in the 1933 Birthday Honours for services to medicine. Acland stood in the election for the conservative Citizens' Association. Campaign Sullivan's selection for the 1935 mayoralty election was announced on 1 February. John Beanland and Ernest Andrews were rumoured as possible candidates for the Citizens' Association, but Acland's candidacy was announced on 25 February. Results Sullivan beat Acland by a small margin, with the election resulting in a record turnout. There were significant differences between the preliminary results released on the evening of the election, and the final results three days later. Council results Aftermath The Labour Party won the November 1935 general election and Sullivan was appointed cabinet minister. Sullivan reluctantly resigned from the mayoralty in February 1936, as the heavy workload of a cabinet minister was incompatible with remaining mayor. The resulting by- election on 11 March 1936 was narrowly won by the deputy-mayor, John Beanland, who represented the Citizens' Association. Beanland beat Labour's candidate, John Archer who had previously been mayor from 1925 to 1931.

Originally a liberal author who contributed to Otechestvennye Zapiski, Delo and Vestnik Evropy among other magazines, Evgeny Markov gradually drifted towards the conservative camp, became part of the Slavophile movement and gained notoriety by being arguably the fiercest critic of Nikolai Nekrasov. Markov's major novel, Black Earth Field (Черноземное поле, 1878), eulogized the simple, close-to-nature life of an idealized, well-cultured Russian landlord. Even more retrograde was his collection of autobiographical notes and sketches Barchuki (Барчуки, 1874), full of nostalgia for 'simple and quiet virtues' of the old Russia's serfdom. What stood the test of time better was his legacy of traveller sketches, notably the popular Sketches of Crimea (Очерки Крыма, 1872), as well as Sketches of Caucasus (Очерки Кавказа, 1887), Journey to the East (Путешествие на Восток, Vols. 1-2, 1890–1891), Russia in Central Asia (Россия в Средней Азии, 1901) and Journey Through Serbia and Montenegro (Путешествие по Сербии и Черногории, 1903). His younger son Nikolai Markov, was a Russian politician and publicist, one the leaders of the Black Hundred movement.

Created in 1965, POTU was assigned to United States Army Europe and located in Heidelberg, Germany. Personnel consisted of one lieutenant colonel, two majors, one captain, two warrant officers and four non-commissioned officers. In 1965, the Army contracted with the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University to develop and implement a test and evaluation program. APL developed the Pershing Operational Test Program (OTP), provided technical support to the Pershing Operational Test Unit (POTU), identified problem areas and improved the performance and survivability of the Pershing systems. POTU planned, scheduled, and executed the tests, evaluations, and missile firings to support OTP. POTU would select three firing batteries from the 56th Field Artillery Command in West Germany to participate in Follow-on Operational Tests (FOT) using an unannounced Field Alert Status Verification (FASV) at the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) site. POTU selected missiles, equipment and personnel (colloquially referred to as a tap) for transport to either Cape Canaveral or White Sands Missile Range. After arrival, the missiles and launchers would be equipped with telemetry and the missiles would have range safety equipment installed for in-flight destruction if needed. Shoots were supported by elements of the 3rd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment from Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The missile crews would perform tactical countdowns and launch the missile. Data collectors from APL observed the crews and equipment. After the shoot, data and evaluations were compiled into reports of the performance estimates of the operational capabilities of the Pershing missile system.

The film is directed by Gavin Hood, and Gun is portrayed by Keira Knightley. The film also stars Matt Smith, Matthew Goode, Adam Bakri, Indira Varma, and Ralph Fiennes. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 28 January 2019 and was released in the United States on 30 August 2019, by IFC Films, and in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2019, by Entertainment One. Plot summary In early 2003, GCHQ analyst Katharine Gun obtains a memo detailing a joint United States and British operation to spy on diplomats from several non-permanent United Nations Security Council member states Cameroon, Chile, Bulgaria and Guinea in order to \\"dig dirt\\" on them and influence the Security Council into passing a resolution supporting an invasion of Iraq. Angered that the United Kingdom is being led into a war on false pretenses, Katharine leaks the memo to a friend involved in the anti-war movement, who passes it to anti-war activist Yvonne Ridley, who in turn passes it to The Observer journalist Martin Bright. The Observer editor Peter Beaumont allows Martin to investigate the story in the interest of journalism. To verify the authenticity of the leak memo, Martin enlists the help of the Observer's Washington, DC correspondent Ed Vulliamy in contacting the memo's author Frank Koza, the Chief of Staff at the \\"regional targets\\" section of the National Security Agency. Despite the Observer pro-war stance, Peter convinces chief editor Roger Alton that the leaked memo is worth publishing. The publication of the leaked memo in March 2003 generates considerable public and media interest. The Drudge Report attempts to discredit the document as a fake after a young staffer named Nicole Mowbray accidentally changed the text from American to British English. However, Martin is able to produce the original memo, confirming its authenticity. Katharine's actions prompt GCHQ to launch an internal investigation. Seeking to prevent the US and UK invasion of Iraq, Katharine confesses to leaking the memo. She is arrested and imprisoned for a night before being released on remand. Following the outbreak of the Iraq War, Katharine seeks the services of the Liberty lawyers Ben Emmerson and Shami Chakrabarti. The British Government decides to charge her with violating the Official Secrets Act, tasking Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald with leading the prosecution. To exert pressure on her, the British authorities attempt to deport her husband Yasar Gun, an Iraqi Kurd. However, Katharine is able to halt the deportation by presenting a marriage proving the authenticity of her marriage. Ben come up with the defence strategy that Katharine was acting out of loyalty to her country by seeking to prevent the UK from being led into an unlawful war in Iraq. With the help of Martin, Ed, and former Foreign Office deputy legal adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst, Ben discovers that that the Attorney General Peter Goldsmith changed his position on the legality of the Iraq War after meeting with several lawyers from the Bush Administration. Despite the odds stacked against them, Katharine refuses to plead guilty in exchange for a reduced charged. On the trial day, the Crown prosecutor Ken drops all charges against Katharine on the grounds that prosecuting Katharine would have shown that the Blair government led the UK into war on false pretenses. The film then mentions the human toll of the Iraq War and that Lord Goldsmith's advice on the illegality of the Iraq War was made public in 2010. The film then ends with footage of Katharine addressing the media following the dismissal of her case and Ben shunning Ken for putting Katharine through her legal ordeal.

Eventually it found itself on The Black List, a list of \\"most liked\\" screenplays that have not yet been produced, where director Debs Paterson saw it. Still, nothing come out of it until in January 2016, when a filming start in May was announced, with Harrison Ford, Anthony Hopkins, Paul Bettany, Natalie Dormer and Martin Freeman cast. Tahar Rahim and Gillian Anderson were cast during the 2016 Berlin International Film Festival. However by June 2017, filming had yet to begin, and cast member Anderson stated she had not heard anything about the project since being cast. By January 2018, the project was redeveloped once more, with Gavin Hood now set to direct in place of Justin Chadwick, and Keira Knightley and Matt Smith cast in February, replacing the previous cast. In March, Ralph Fiennes and Matthew Goode joined the cast, with filming beginning on 12 March 2018 in Yorkshire. Filming took place in the village of Boston Spa on 14 March. Indira Varma, Conleth Hill and Tamsin Greig joined the cast the next day. Filming had moved to Manchester by 19 March, serving as a stand-in for London. Filming was undertaken in April 2018 in Liverpool's St George's Hall.  Release  The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 28 January 2019. Shortly after, IFC Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It was released in the United States on 30 August 2019. It was previously scheduled to be released on 23 August 2019. and in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2019.  Reception  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 6.89/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Official Secrets has a familiar structure and an obvious if worthy message, but rises on the strength of Keira Knightley's powerful performance.\\" In an article about the film and Katherine Gun, Sam Husseini wrote that \\"having followed this story from the start, I find this film to be, by Hollywood standards, a remarkably accurate account of what has happened to date—'to date' because the wider story still isn’t really over.\\"  References   External links   * Category:2019 films Category:2019 thriller drama films Category:2010s spy films Category:2010s political films Category:American films Category:American thriller drama films Category:American spy films Category:American political drama films Category:British films Category:British thriller drama films Category:British spy films Category:British political films Category:Films about whistleblowing Category:Films directed by Gavin Hood Category:Films set in 2003 Category:Films set in 2004 Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Gloucestershire Category:Films shot in Lancashire Category:Films shot in Yorkshire Category:Entertainment One films Category:IFC Films films Category:Scanbox Entertainment films Category:Docudrama films Category:2019 drama films ","title":"Official Secrets (film)"},{"id":"50480773","text":"Under the Influence is the seventeenth studio album by British hard rock band Foghat.

He was appointed amir al-ʿarab (commander of the Bedouin) by the Mamluks after their conquest of Syria in 1260. Isa's father served the same post under the Ayyubids. His assignment gave him command over the nomadic Arab tribes of Syria and obliged him to provide auxiliary troops in times of war and guard the desert frontier from the Mongol Ilkhanate in Iraq. As part of his emirate, he was granted Salamiyah and Sarmin. He participated in numerous campaigns against the Ilkhanate during Sultan Baybars' reign (1260–1277). In 1379/80, Isa defected from Baybars' successor, Qalawun, and joined the rebellion of the Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Sunqur al-Ashqar. However, Isa dissuaded Sunqur from joining the Ilkhanids' army, and was dismissed from his post when Qalawun's forces suppressed the rebellion. Isa was reinstalled by 1280, and in the following year, played a decisive role as a commander in the Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanate at the Second Battle of Homs. After his death, Isa was succeeded by his son Muhanna, and throughout the 14th century, Isa's direct descendants held the office of amir al-ʿarab with occasional interruption. Ancestry Isa's clan, the Al Fadl, were direct descendants of the Jarrahid ruler of Palestine, Mufarrij ibn Daghfal (d. 1013), himself a member of the ancient tribe of Tayy;Hiyari 1975, pp. 513–514. Isa's laqab was \\"Sharaf ad-Din al-Tayyi\\", denoting his Tayyid roots. By the early 13th century, the Al Fadl dominated the desert region between Homs in the west to the Euphrates valley in the east and from Qal'at Ja'bar southward through central Najd. Isa's great-grandfather, Haditha (grandson of the Al Fadl's progenitor, Fadl ibn Rabi'ah), served as the first amir al-ʿarab (commander of the Bedouin tribes) under Ayyubid sultan al-Adil (r. 1200–1218), beginning a tradition of Al Fadl tribesmen being appointed to the office. Isa's father Muhanna and grandfather Mani (d. 1232) both served the post.Hiyari 1975, pp. 515–516. Amir al- ʿarab It is not evident in medieval Muslim sources when Muhanna died or when the post of amir al-ʿarab was stripped from him. It is known for certain that prior to the Mamluk conquest of Syria in 1260, the amir al-ʿarab was Muhanna's uncle Ali ibn Haditha. The circumstances of Isa's replacement of Ali are also unclear. In some versions, Isa was appointed by Sultan Qutuz as a reward for his support in the Battle of Ain Jalut against the Mongols in the latter half of 1260, though the sources indicate that Isa and his Bedouin horsemen refrained from actually participating in the battle.Amitai-Preiss 1995, pp. 64–65. In another version, Qutuz's successor Baybars appointed Isa as a reward for assisting him during his 1250s exile in Syria (in this version, Ali was stripped of the title as punishment for denying Baybars refuge). In any case, it is known that Baybars issued a diploma confirming Isa as amir al-ʿarab and recognizing his iqtaʿat (fiefs) in 1260/61. Among his iqta'at were half of Salamiyah,Sato 1997, p. 96.Tritton 1948, p. 567. which was separated from the iqtaʿ of Hama, and Sarmin. Baybars also entrusted the Al Fadl and the other Bedouin tribes of the Syrian desert and steppe with guarding the Syrian frontier with Mongol Ilkhanid-held Iraq.Amitai-Preiss 1995, p. 66. =Service with Baybars= Isa's relations with Baybars were generally on good terms, though there were occasional exceptions.Hiyari 1975, p. 517. Following the Mongol destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad in 1258, two Abbasid princes escaped; Abu al-'Abbas (later known as al-Hakim), was the first to reach Syria under Isa's protection. However, the second surviving prince, Abu al-Qasim (known by the regnal name Al-Mustansir), was chosen by Baybars and inaugurated as the Abbasid caliph in Cairo. Isa accompanied al-Mustansir on his Mamluk-sponsored campaign to reclaim Iraq from the Mongols.Tritton 1948, pp. 567–568. However, al-Mustansir was killed en route to Baghdad in a Mongol ambush in October 1261.Aigle 2015, p. 244. The next year, Isa was present in Cairo to bear witness that al-Mustansir's successor and kinsman, al-Hakim, was indeed a member of the Abbasid line. Isa's assignment to the post was opposed by some of his kinsmen from the start.Hiyari 1975, p. 516. The strongest opposition came from Ahmad ibn Hajji of the Al Mira, relatives of the Al Fadl through their shared ancestor Rabi'ah ibn Hazim, whose descendants were collectively known as the Banu Rabi'ah.Hiyari 1975, pp. 516–517. Ahmad ibn Hajji and his tribe were considered by the historians of their day as the kings of the Arabs (muluk al-ʿarab) of the southern Syrian Desert, and Ahmad ibn Hajji led the struggle against Isa for the official post of amir al-ʿarab. Their conflict dissipated as the Mamluks gave the Al Mira virtual independence in the southern desert, while maintaining Isa as amir al-ʿarab. Isa also faced opposition from Ahmad ibn Tahir ibn Ghannam, another distant relative from the Banu Rabi'ah, and from his Al Fadl kinsman Zamil ibn Ali ibn Haditha. The latter coveted the post, viewing himself as the rightful heir to the office that had been held by his father. In his conflict with Isa, Zamil was defeated, imprisoned, then released after a reconciliation between the chieftains of the Banu Rabi'ah in 1264.Tritton 1948, p. 568. Ahmad ibn Tahir, whose demand of a share in Isa's emirate was denied by Baybars, desisted from further opposition when he was given a smaller emirate elsewhere in Syria. In early 1265, Isa was dispatched by Baybars to lead a raid against Ilkhanid-held Harran as a diversion for a Mamluk expedition aimed at relieving their Anatolian fortress of al-Birah from an Ilkhanid siege; al-Birah's defenders withstood the siege and the Ilkhanids retreated in haste with the arrival of Mamluk forces in February.Amitai-Preiss 1995, pp. 112–113. In 1268/69, Baybars took hostage some of the Bedouin chieftains' sons as leverage to ensure that their fathers did not defect to the Ilkhanids. That same year, he halved Isa's annual grant of 130,000 silver dirhams. Baybars' actions backfired when Isa made it apparent that he would defect to the Ilkhanids; the Bedouin tribes' defection to the Ilkhanids was a constant possibility and gave Isa considerable leverage with Baybars.Amitai-Preiss 1995, p. 68. News of this turn of events prompted Baybars to secretly rush to Syria from Egypt on 15 September 1270 and secure Isa's commitment to the Mamluks. He arrived in Hama on 4 October and summoned Isa. During the meeting, Baybars asked Isa whether rumors of his planned defection were true and Isa answered in the affirmative. Afterward, Baybars honored him and agreed to free the hostages, restore Isa's grant, and distribute to the Bedouin tribes large amounts of wheat. As a result, Isa swore an oath of loyalty to Baybars and afterward participated in every Mamluk campaign against the Ilkhanids. The first of these campaigns occurred soon after Isa's meeting with Baybars, when he led raids against the Ilkhanids in Edessa and Harran in southern Anatolia. In 1273, Isa led raids against Ilkhanid-held Anbar in western Iraq on orders from Baybars, possibly to divert Ilkhanid forces from an expedition against Syria. The Mongols at Anbar retreated without resistance as Isa advanced.Amitai-Preiss 1995, p. 133. Months later, in March 1274, Isa's forces confronted a group of Khafaja Bedouin in Anbar, though there was no conclusive victory after a daylong battle. Isa commanded a contingent of Baybars' army in the 1277 campaign against the Mongols at the Battle of Elbistan. He visited Egypt later that year with Ahmad ibn Hajji, and the two were well received by Baybars. =Career during Qalawun's reign= Baybars died in July 1277 and was succeeded by his sons who ruled in name only while Baybars' closest subordinate, Qalawun, acted as strongman. Qalawun usurped the throne in 1279 and soon after faced a rebellion by his viceroy in Syria, Sunqur al- Ashqar,Northrup 1998, ed. Petry, p. 274. who was joined by Isa.Northrup 1998, p. 94. The Ilkhanids and their Armenian and Georgian allies took advantage of the intra-Mamluk strife and an invitation by Sunqur to invade Syria, and sacked Aleppo. Isa reprimanded Sunqur for inciting the Muslims' enemies to attack and urged him not to betray Islam in his late age.Northrup 1998, p. 101. Isa persuaded Sunqur not to join the Ilkhanids and the latter escaped Qalawun's advancing army.Northrup 1998, p. 97. Isa also sought to evade Qalawun's troops and barricaded himself in the desert fortress of al-Rahba. He was replaced by his relative Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as punishment by Qalawun for supporting Sunqur's revolt. Muhammad's appointment was likely in name only, and in any case, Isa reconciled with Qalawun by 1280, when the sultan received him in Cairo. During the Second Battle of Homs between the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids in October 1281, Isa commanded the right flank of the Mamluk army.Amitai-Preiss 1995, pp. 191–192. Under his command were the horsemen of Al Fadl, Al Mira and Banu Kilab among other Syrian tribes. During the course of the battle, the Mamluk right held firm against the Ilkhanid right's assault and then the Mamluk divisions (excluding Isa's right flank) led a joint counterattack against the Ilkhanid right.Amitai-Preiss 1995, p. 197. It was during this counterattack that Isa's forces mounted a major assault against the Ilkhanid left ending in a rout. Afterward, the Mamluk divisions destroyed the Ilkhanid center and forced the latter's retreat, resulting in a decisive Mamluk victory. Isa was praised in Mamluk histories of the battle for securing the Mamluk victory.Northrup 1998, p. 111. In reward for his performance, he was made the lord of Palmyra in late 1281. Death and legacy Isa died in May 1284. He was succeeded by his son Muhanna ibn Isa, who inherited his emirate,Hiyari 1975, p. 518. and became the lord of the ancient oasis town of Palmyra. For the next quarter century, Muhanna and another of Isa's sons, Fadl, held the office of amir al-ʿarab with minor interruptions. Isa's branch of the Al Fadl dynasty, sometimes referred to as \\"Al Isa\\", served the office through much of the 14th century.Hiyari 1975, pp. 517–518.

Bellow served as the Leader of the Leeds City Council from 1975 to 1979. As council leader, he sold 3,000 council houses and cut rates, which brought him to the attention of Margaret Thatcher.

Between 1983 and 1984 he was Minister of State for the Environment (Local Government). As a junior minister, Bellwin piloted 28 bills through the House of Lords, including the Thatcher government's 'Right to Buy' legislation and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. He spoke more than 1,000 times in the Lords during the passage of Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. The Bellwin scheme, which he introduced in 1983, is named after him. He resigned from the government in 1984, allegedly because of his opposition to Margaret Thatcher's plans to abolish the Labour-dominated metropolitan county councils.

Until 1462, the town was known as Corsignano. It took the name Pienza from its most famous native son, Pope Pius II (Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini), who elevated the town to the status of a city (civitas), and established the new diocese. The diocese existed as an independent entity from 1462 to 1772, directly subject to the Holy See (Papacy). History The architect chosen to carry out Pius II's plans to construct Pienza was Bernardo Rossellino.Mack, pp. 32-35. The change in name of Corsignano was carried out by the Senate of Siena, at the suggestion of Pope Pius, on 1 June 1462.Mack, pp. 41-42. On 29 August 1462, the Feast of the cutting off (decollazione) of the head of John the Baptist, the completed cathedral was dedicated by Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, Bishop of Ostia, though the Pope personally dedicated the high altar.Mannucci, p. 16. The cathedral was named the Cathedral of the taking up of the body (Assumption) of the Virgin Mary into heaven. The edifice was damaged by the large earthquake of 26 November 1545, and the apse began to subside, a problem which persists to the present day.Mannucci, pp. 19-20.

In April 1473, Bishop Tommaso della Testa Piccolomini presided over the first diocesan synod held in Pienza.Chironi, p. 180, note 29. On 23 May 1594, Pope Clement VIII separated the two dioceses of Pienza and Montalcino. On 15 June 1772, in the bull \\"Quemadmodum\\", Pope Clement XIV united the dioceses of Chiusi and Pienza.

Biography After completing secondary school in 1850, he studied at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw until 1857, where his primary instructor was Rafał Hadziewicz. This was followed by studies in Paris, Vienna and Munich. After completing his studies, he worked briefly in Warsaw as a scenery painter for the set designer, Antonio Sacchetti (1790–1870).Biographical notes @ Agra Art. From 1863, he lived in Częstochowa, where he taught at the local gymnasium. Pilgrims Arriving at Jasna Góra During this time, he created numerous works related to the Kalisz Region. Many of the buildings he depicted no longer exist, so his paintings have acquired great documentary value. His work includes an album of 52 watercolors of the Jasna Góra Monastery and the ceremonies there. He often accompanied his works with descriptions and commentary, and wrote several articles on the monuments of the region.Brief biography @ Absolwenci Sienkiewicza. In 1873, he moved to Warsaw. There, he began to provide illustrations for Kłosach (Ears), ' (Literary Feast) and the Tygodnik Ilustrowany. He also wrote a major article about his work in Częstochowa for the literary journal Wiek and continued teaching at a school for the deaf as well as giving private lessons.

It was created as a vehicle to reprint stories from early issues of Wonder Stories, Startling Stories, and Wonder Stories Quarterly, which were owned by the same publisher. It lasted for four issues, succumbing in 1953 to competition from the growing market for paperback science fiction. Reprinted stories included Twice in Time, by Manly Wade Wellman, and \\"The Brain-Stealers of Mars\\", by John W. Campbell.  Publication history and contents  The first science fiction (sf) magazine, Amazing Stories, was launched in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback at the height of the pulp magazine era. It helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, and by the mid-1930s several more sf magazines had appeared, including Wonder Stories, also published by Gernsback. In 1936, Ned Pines of Beacon Publications bought Wonder Stories from Gernsback,Ashley (2000), p. 91. changed the title to Thrilling Wonder Stories,Ashley (2000), p. 100. and in 1939 and 1940 added two more sf titles: Startling Stories and Captain Future.Ashley (2000), p. 136.Ashley (2000), pp. 151−153. Pines had acquired reprint rights to the fiction published in Wonder Stories as part of the transaction, and some of this material ran in Startling Stories and Captain Future, but neither magazine had room for some of the longer stories in the backfile. At the end of the 1940s a boom in science fiction magazines encouraged Pines to issue a new magazine, titled Fantastic Story Quarterly, as a vehicle for reprinting this older material, with the first issue dated Spring 1950.Ashley (1985a), pp. 249−250. It was successful enough for Pines to add another reprint magazine, Wonder Story Annual, later that year. Pines' plan was to use the new magazine to reprint novels, with only a few short stories included to fill out the magazine. The first issue was dated 1950 and appeared in the summer of that year.Ashley (2005), p. 37. The reprinted novels were Twice in Time, by Manly Wade Wellman; Gateway to Paradise, by Jack Williamson; The Onslaught from Rigel, by Fletcher Pratt (titled Invaders from Rigel when it eventually saw publication in book form in 1960), and The Death of Iron, by S.S. Held, a French writer (the novel was translated into English by Pratt for the original serialization in Wonder Stories, which began in 1932). The magazine also reprinted some shorter material, including \\"The Brain-Stealers of Mars\\" by John W. Campbell, \\"Nothing Sirius\\" by Fredric Brown, \\"The Irritated People\\" by Ray Bradbury, and \\"The Eternal Man\\", by D.D. Sharp, which combined Sharp's earlier \\"The Eternal Man\\", from the August 1929 Science Wonder with \\"The Eternal Man Revives\\" from the Summer 1930 Wonder Stories Quarterly.Gammell (1986), p. 44. Although Wonder Story Annual was well-received and initially successful, it faced strong competition for sf readers from paperbacks, including reprint anthologies. In response it labelled itself \\"America's Best Science Fiction Anthology\\", but by 1953 the battle was lost, and that year's issue was the last. Bibliographic details The magazine was issued annually for four years, from 1950 to 1953. The editor was Sam Merwin for the first two issues, and Samuel Mines for the second two. There was a single volume of three issues, followed by a final volume of one issue. The magazine was in pulp format and was priced at 25 cents; the first issue was 196 pages and the remaining three all had 160 pages. The publisher was Better Publications of Chicago and New York for the first issue, and Best Books, of Kokomo, Indiana, for the next three; Better Publications was an imprint of Standard Magazines of New York, and Best Books was owned by Standard.Ashley (1985b), pp. 766−767. A Canadian edition of the first issue appeared from Better Publications in Toronto with the same contents as the U.S. edition.

Design and construction The Class 290 was a development of the earlier Class 270 locomotives, studied under the Rete Adriatica; it kept the wheelbase, but replaced the boiler with a slightly bigger one, with a minimally coned rear ring. Its construction was continued under the new FS management, which made it one of its twelve standard designs; it was the last and most successful 0-6-0 Italian locomotive. The class was built by several Italian and foreign manufacturers, between 1899 and 1913. The first 30 locomotives were fitted with a two-axle tender, with a coal capacity of and a water capacity of ; the subsequent ones were fitted with the three-axle tender that would see widespread service under the FS (especially behind the Class 625 and Class 640 locomotives). The first 112 locomotives were classified as Class RA 350 bis (with running numbers between 3631 and 3742); of these, 52 were taken over by the FS in July 1905 upon formation, while the other 60 were taken over by the new Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Southern Railways), a rump of the RA, until its incorporation with the FS in July 1906. Service The class saw widespread service on the Italian network, with the first members of the class being sent to work as helpers on the steep lines around Fabriano and Sulmona. Some locomotives were withdrawn relatively early, but as many as 60 were still active after World War II; however, their activity ceased by the end of the 1950s. Preservation The last member of the class to remain active, the 290.319, survived into preservation; it is currently kept in the Pietrarsa railway museum.

A second series in 1986 was co- written with Guy Jenkin, the title reduced to simply Kit Curran. Set in the fictional UK location of 'Newtown' (though exteriors are filmed in Bracknell), it stars Denis Lawson as devious radio DJ Kit Curran, Paul Brooke as his assistant, Les Toms, and Clive Merrison as newsreader Damien Appleby. The first series saw Kit clashing with new station boss Roland Simpson (Brian Wilde), while the second series saw Kit attempt to start his own pirate radio station, while fighting for the affection of Pamela Scott (Lindsay Duncan). Cast * Denis Lawson as Kit Curran * Paul Brooke as Les Toms * Clive Merrison as Damien Appleby * Brian Wilde as Roland Simpson (series one only) * Lindsay Duncan as Pamela Scott (series two only) Guest cast Two semi- regular cast members were Philip Dunbar, who played George, a caller to the station in every episode of the first series, and Joseph Marcell, who played Constantine, a security worker at the station. Notable guest cast members included Barbara Lott and Angus Mackay as BBC Radio Executives, Stephen Frost as a robber, Noel Coleman as a judge, Geoffrey Whitehead as a bank manager, Kevin Lloyd as an ambulance driver and Ray Burdis as 'Ray', a talent show entrant. Situation In the first season, Kit (Denis Lawson) is a DJ on Newtown Radio, in the fictional location of Newtown. Episodes revolve around him trying to outwit the new station manager, Roland Simpson (Brian Wilde), and avoiding being fired. The second season saw Kit finally sacked from the station, along with studio engineer Les Toms (Paul Brooke) and newsreader Damien Appleby (Clive Merrison). The three go into business together, setting up a pirate radio station in hired offices in Brentford. While there, Kit tries to woo Pamela Scott (Lindsay Duncan), the manager of a neighbouring business. (The fictional Newtown of the first season was filmed in Bracknell, and the second season opening credits show Kit looking at a road sign pointing to Brentford and the West End of London, deciding which route to take.) Episodes There were two series, each of six episodes, as follows: Series 1: The Kit Curran Radio Show (2 April 1984 – 7 May 1984) #\\"End of an Era\\" (2 April 1984) #\\"The New Broom\\" (9 April 1984) #\\"Bread and Circuses\\" (16 April 1984) #\\"P Is for Positive\\" (23 April 1984) #\\"Election Fever\\" (30 April 1984) #\\"The Big Break\\" (7 May 1984) Series 2: Kit Curran (21 July 1986 – 25 August 1986) #\\"One Door Closes\\" (21 July 1986) (25'03m duration) #\\"The Lucky Break\\" (28 July 1986) (24'48m) #\\"The Street of Shame\\" (4 August 1986) (23'57m) #\\"A Sick Society\\" (11 August 1986) (25'02m) #\\"Blind Date\\" (18 August 1986) (23'41m) #\\"Doctors Can Seriously Damage Your Health\\" (25 August 1986) (23'42m) Theme tune The theme tune, Ultra Fantastico, was composed by David Mackay with lyrics by Ian La Frenais. Sung by Denis Lawson, it was released as a single on EMI in 1984, though failed to chart. Commercial release Both seasons of the programme were repeated on UK Gold in the 1990s. Although the series has yet to be released on DVD, in December 2011 the second season was released as downloads from ITunes and is still commercially available. However, the episodes are erroneously listed both as a drama and as season one. The complete series will be released on DVD on 10/09/2018. Legacy It appears that the programme is often forgotten today, receiving little attention on the web, save for occasional mentions in unrelated articles, such as The Guardian citing radio sitcoms with 'Hence the comedy spoofs – Smashie and Nicey, Alan Partridge, or the 1980s Channel 4 sitcom The Kit Curran Radio Show – all bonhomie and smooth on air, but with a weird, desperate edge as soon as the red studio light goes off.' James Rampton, writing for The Independent in 1994, slated the series, stating 'DJs have never been much fun on TV. Remember The Kit Curran Radio Show (ITV, 1984) with Denis Lawson? Exactly.' The first season was suggested as being something of a failure for producer Derrick Goodwin in the book On The Buses: The Complete Story by Craig Walker. Walker describes the series as a 'short-lived affair' and that 'six episodes later the sitcom ended.'Walker, Craig (2009), pp.120 On the Buses: The Complete Story. Apex Publishing Ltd.

The exhibition which had been planned since 1912 was a commercial venture and not fully supported by the civic dignitaries of the city which caused difficulties raising the funds needed. Most of the construction of the venues was from wooden frames covered by plasterboard and occurred in just 2 months prior to opening. It opened on 28 May 1914 was closed on 6 June. Further funding was raised and the exhibition reopened, but continued to struggle with lower than expected attendance and, following several court hearings, finally closed on 15 August just after the outbreak of World War I. The site covered next to the River Avon and was served by two railway stations. The venues included: an International Pavilion and a concert hall, a replica of Bristol Castle, a representation of \\"Old Plymouth\\" with a replica of the Revenge and the Dominions Pavilion. Other attractions included a Scenic Railway roller coaster and buildings representing \\"Shakespeare's England\\". The entire site was lit by electric lighting including the Pageant Ground which had a grandstand holding 4,000 people. After the premature closure of the exhibition the site was used, until 1919, as barracks for The Gloucestershire Regiment. Some buildings became warehouses after the troops left but all had been demolished before World War II when the site was again used for troops and then squatters housing. There are no structures on the site which is now used for allotments, a cricket club and the horse and dog section of Avon and Somerset Constabulary.  Planning  Plans for the exhibition were laid in 1912. The initial directors were local business leaders, but they were soon replaced by the merchant John Bellham and theatre artist and director Leolyn Gustav Hart who had been involved in The Festival of Empire which was held at The Crystal Palace in London in 1911, to celebrate the coronation of King George V. The idea was to hold a colonial exhibition to encourage local business and trade with the British dominions. Support from some of the leaders of the city's civic leaders was limited as many were already involved in organising the annual exhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society of England which was to be held in Bristol in 1913 on Durdham Down. In 1913 shares were issued in the company and the rental of the site was agreed with the owners, the city corporation () and the Great Western Railway (). Publicity for the event was distributed to newspapers in April 1913 and extensive coverage detailed plans for the exhibition buildings, concerts, music competitions and pageants. The pageants were planned by John Henderson and themed around the history of Bristol during the periods 875–1373, 1486–1663 and 1764–1831. A cast of 1,200 local people was planned. The company planning the exhibition raised funds from a variety of backers based on accounts which projected an income of £186,882 which would include entrance fees from 2 million visitors, and expenditure of £145,966 including £59,000 construction costs. Clearance of the site started at the end of 1913 but was then delayed until March 1914 after the finance had been agreed. During the two months before the exhibition was due to open in May, an average of 2,000 workers per week employed by the Westminster Construction Company Ltd were on site.  Site  The site, which was also known as Ashton Fields or Rownham Fields as well as Ashton Meadows, covered and was served by two railway stations Clifton Bridge railway station and Ashton Gate railway station which was renamed Exhibition Station for the duration of the event. The triangular site was bordered by the River Avon on the north, a road called Ashton Avenue on the east and the railway tracks on the west, with a bridge over the other set of railway tracks running across the site. Each of the exhibition halls was built of a timber frame cladded with plasterboard and mouldings made from fibre and gypsum given them a white appearance and it became known locally and in some press reports as the White City. The major buildings included the International Pavilion and a concert hall with a capacity of 5,000. A replica of Bristol Castle was erected at the northern end of the site to hold military exhibits next to the Dominions Pavilion which was intended to showcase the products of the dominions. South of these was the Pageant Ground with seating for 4,000 in the grandstand. Other exhibits included a Scenic Railway roller coaster and buildings representing \\"Shakespeare's England\\", designed by Jennie Cornwallis-West (better known as Lady Randolph Churchill), which had been successfully exhibited at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in 1912. The electric lighting which was installed by the Bristol Corporation Electricity Department, was still innovative and expensive. It involved over of cable including under the river.  Exhibition  Although incomplete the exhibition was officially opened on 28 May 1914 by John Swaish the Lord Mayor of Bristol. The day included tours for journalists, a concert and choir followed by a firework display. Visitors entered the exhibition via an avenue of murals on canvas representing agriculture, trade landscapes or culture from Rhodesia, India, Australia and Malaysia. They then passed over a foot bridge over the railway and approached the International Pavilion which was high and covered a floor space of . It held exhibits related to industry and manufacturing. The next section included the Egyptian gardens and colonnade. The music pavilion could hold 4,000 customers, with a large dance floor, an orchestra and space for a choir of up to 1,200. The pleasure side of the exhibition included the figure of eight roller coaster, a jungle area where the performances included lions, and entertainments such as a hall of mirrors and rifle range. \\"Shakespeare's England\\" consisted of \\"old- world\\" architecture and was adjacent to the \\"Dominions Garden\\" with its bandstand close to the Dominions Pavilion and a fine arts gallery. Near the replica of Bristol Castle was a representation of \\"Old Plymouth\\" with a replica of the Revenge the flagship of Francis Drake against the Spanish Armada.  Financial problems  On 6 June, just eight days after the official opening, Leolyn Hart closed the exhibition and told workmen who were still finishing some of the displays not to come into work. Gate receipts were poor and the original funding of £100,000 had been exhausted. The debenture holders wanted the exhibition to stay open to try to recoup some of their losses. Arthur Collins was appointed as the receiver and attempted to raise further funds from local supporters. It reopened on 10 June and further funding was obtained from backers in London. New managers were appointed who criticised Bristolians for not backing the exhibition. Although a winding-up order had been submitted by a creditor, on 26 June the receiver announced that further money had been raised and plans for additional attractions were in place. Daily pageants and a variety of lectures were included in the programme. The daily pageants ran from 29 June to 18 July but failed to recoup the initial outlay. A further court hearing was held on 20 July and the company responsible for the exhibition was wound up, although it stayed open and attendances increased. The exhibition closed for good on 15 August soon after the declaration of hostilities which became the First World War.  Subsequent use  And after closure the buildings were then used for troop barracks and a drill hall by troops from 'Bristol's Own' the 12th Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment. The last troops left the site in January 1919 and the equipment sold off. During the 1920s some of the buildings were used as warehouses, but were removed by the 1930s. In World War II the site was again used for barracks for troops, and in the post war period squatted by those made homeless during the bombing of the Bristol Blitz. All of the buildings have since been removed. The site is now used for sports pitches including the Bedminster Cricket Club, the \\"White City Allotments\\" and the horse and dog section of Avon and Somerset Constabulary.

Composition Guide to Strange Places is composed in a single movement and has a duration of roughly 24 minutes. =Background= Adams first conceived the work when he stumbled across a guidebook called Guide Noir de la Provence Mystérieuse (The Black Guide to Mysterious Places of Provence) while vacationing with his family in France. He later wrote: =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising piccolo, two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, four percussionists, harp, piano, celesta, and strings. Reception Guide to Strange Places has received mixed praised from music critics. Barry Witherden of BBC Music Magazine wrote, \\"The early stages are filled with bright, eager expectation, but soon unease creeps in, paving the way for loping menace, apprehension and brutal, hammering figures.\\" Andrew Clements of The Guardian compared the work favorably to Adams's Doctor Atomic Symphony, remarking, \\"Inspired apparently by a French guidebook to Provence, that is a far more focused and darkly disquieting piece; full of nervous, hyperactive figuration, unexpected twists and almost surreal musical imagery, it's one of Adams's most impressive achievements of the last decade.\\" Conversely, Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph described it as \\"one of those frustrating Adams pieces that begins thrillingly and then loses its way.\\" Philip Clark of Gramophone similarly called it \\"a great title that's been waiting for a piece\\" and opined, \\"What does it add up to? File under 'enjoyable escapism'. Unlike the natural charm of, say, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Adams needs to turn his charm on. A jazzy, wolf-whistling riff appears from nowhere that sounds like pure Bernstein – and a contrived sprinkling of Disney-like tinsel before the hard-hitting end-point.\\" Recording A recording of Guide to Strange Places performed by the St. Louis Symphony under David Robertson was released through Nonesuch Records on July 28, 2009.

Seeger also went on to win a bronze medal for tennis at the 1957 Summer Deaflympics. Early life and education Seeger was born on May 30, 1924, in Evan, Minnesota, and grew up in Sleepy Eye. She was the daughter of Olga and William Taubert, and had one brother, Sheldon. At an early age, it was discovered Seeger was deaf. She was inspired by athlete Babe Didrikson Zaharias. Seeger was educated at Rochester Institute for the Oral, and later Minnesota State School for the Deaf, where she took part in various sports competitions. After graduation, she enrolled at Gallaudet University where she participated in several sporting competitions due to her being a member of the Women's Athletic Association. It was part of Seeger's plan to become a coach and assist other people in achieving their goals in athletics. In 1949 she married Texan-born Julius Seeger one day after she graduated; they had one son, Mark (born 1960). Athletic career After completing her studies in 1949 with a bachelor of arts degree, she was selected as the first deaf American woman to compete for the United States track and field team in the 1957 Summer Deaflympics.

Sardesai held the portfolios of Town & Country Planning; Agriculture; Archives & Archeology; as well as Factories & Boilers in the Government of Goa, until his removal from the cabinet of ministers on 13 July 2019.  Early life and personal background Vijai Sardesai was born on 14 June 1970 in Buenos Aires, Argentina to Jaivant and Laxmibai (née Mogabai) Sardesai. His father Jaivant was a scientist/entomologist who served with the United Nations. His siblings are Savita Kerkar and (Late) Madhavi Sardesai. Sardesai earned a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture from the Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth in 1992 and is a real estate dealer by profession. Vijai married Usha Sardesai and they have a daughter named Urvi. Sardesai is the President of the Progressive Goa Wrestling Association and also of the Goa Dodgeball Association. Sardesai has pledged to donate his eyes post his death.  Political career  Vijai started his political career in the student politics of Goa. He was the Chairman of the Goa University Students Council. Sardesai started his political career in the Indian National Congress and he was the President of Goa Pradesh Youth Congress. Sardesai was co-opted as a councillor of the Margao Municipal Council. =Independent MLA= Vijai Sardesai was denied the Indian National Congress candidature from the Fatorda constituency during the 2012 Goa Legislative Assembly election. Sardesai quit the Indian National Congress as an independent candidate and emerged victorious. During his debut as an independent MLA, Sardesai emerged as a fierce opposition figure. His performance on the floor of the Goa Legislative Assembly and outside the Assembly too made Sardesai popular. Vijai Sardesai ensured the victory of his panel in the Margao Municipal Council elections in 2015. Sardesai was accused by his opponents of being involved in the Louis Berger bribery scam but the allegations remain unproven. =Goa Forward Party= On 25 January 2016, the Goa Forward Party was launched. Although Sardesai was a mentor of the party, he did not officially join it because of the Anti- Defection Law. Sardesai joined the party on 16 January 2017 and contested the 2017 Goa Legislative Assembly election as a candidate of the Goa Forward Party. The party contested in only four constituencies in the 2017 Assembly elections and emerged victorious in three. Minister in the Manohar Parrikar- led government No single party obtained the requisite majority of 21 seats in the 2017 elections but the Indian National Congress emerged as the largest party with 17 seats. Sardesai and the two other Goa Forward Party legislators supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which secured 13 seats, on the condition that Manohar Parrikar would be appointed the Chief Minister of Goa. Sardesai, whose whole campaign was based on the anti-BJP premise, was criticised by many including his supporters for this act. The Goa Forward Party President Prabhakar Timble resigned after Sardesai and the other two party MLAs accorded their support towards formation of the BJP-led government in Goa. Sardesai justified his decision by stating that the Indian National Congress party as well as the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee President Luizinho Faleiro had ditched him before. He stated that the BJP in Goa was different from that of the national BJP and that the government would work according to a common minimum programme. Sardesai claimed that he would act as a watchdog of Geomkarponn (Goanness) in the government and that he had supported the BJP-led government for stability and development. Vijai Sardesai was sworn in as a cabinet Minister in the Government of Goa headed by Manohar Parrikar on 14 March 2017. The other two Goa Forward Party legislators, Vinoda Paliencar and Jayesh Salgaonkar were also sworn in as cabinet Ministers. At a largely attended protest meet on 18 March 2017 at Margao's Lohia Maidan, Sardesai was condemned by many for supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Manohar Parrikar. Political analyst Kartikeya (KT), has predicted that Vijay Sardesai will one day lead Goa, and that too for very long.

Born in Phnom Penh to a French civil servant – he was the first French child ever born in Cambodia – Groslier was taken by his mother to France at the age of two and grew up in Marseille. Aspiring to become a painter, he tried but failed to win the prestigious Prix de Rome. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Cambodia, on a mission from the Ministry of Education. There he met and befriended a number of French scholars of traditional Cambodian culture. Under their influence, he wrote and published, in France in 1913, his initial book on this subject: Danseuses Cambodgiennes – Anciennes et Modernes (Cambodian Dancers – Ancient and Modern). It was the very first scholarly work ever published in any language on Cambodian dance. He then returned to Cambodia, traveling the length and breadth of the country to examine its ancient monuments and architecture. From this experience came his book A l'ombre d 'Angkor; notes et impressions sur les temples inconnus de l'ancien Cambodge (In the Shadow of Angkor: Notes and Impressions on the Unknown Temples of Ancient Cambodia). In June 1914, Groslier enlisted in the French army and was employed as a balloonist in the early part of World War I. It was during this time that he met and married sportswoman Suzanne Cecile Poujade; they eventually had three children. He was ultimately reassigned to French Indochina because of his knowledge of the Khmer language. Upon his arrival in Phnom Penh in May 1917, he was charged with a new mission: to found a new Cambodian art museum and organize a school of Cambodian arts. From 1917 to his retirement in 1942, Groslier changed the focus of his work from that of merely describing Cambodian culture for a European audience to what he called a \\"rescue mission\\" to save the indigenous national art forms of Cambodia from destruction. His vision for the museum was to build collections from the full range of Cambodia’s traditional works of art. At the art school, Groslier did not try to make the native culture adapt to that of the colonizing power; on the contrary, he insisted that the school be run by Cambodians for Cambodians and that no European influence be allowed. He was also intolerant of any attempts by Europeans to loot or damage native art. In 1923, the 22-year-old writer André Malraux, later to become world-famous, removed some bas-relief statues from a 10th Century temple, Banteay Srei, with the intention of selling them to an art museum. Although Malraux claimed that he was acting within the law, Groslier immediately had him arrested, scarring the former's reputation in Indochina. Groslier would later contemptuously refer to Malraux as \\"le petit voleur\\" (\\"the little thief\\"). Between 1920 and 1939, Groslier's family frequently traveled between France and Cambodia so that the three children could attend schools in France. In 1939, however, events leading up to the Second World War made such travel increasingly dangerous, and Suzanne was forced to remain in France with their two sons, while Nicole, their daughter, stayed with her father in Cambodia. When the Japanese military occupied Cambodia, because French colonies were then administered by the pro- Axis Vichy regime, violence was initially avoided. But in March 1945, as the Allies made further advances in Asia, the Japanese relieved French officials of their authority, rounded up all foreign nationals, and placed them under guard in concentration camps. Because of his known enthusiasm for shortwave radio, Groslier was suspected by the Japanese of being part of the anti- Japanese resistance. On June 18, 1945, in Phnom Penh, while imprisoned by the Kempeitai, Groslier died under torture. He was later officially recognized as Mort pour la France (\\"Died in the service of France\\"). All Groslier's major work was inspired by his profound love and respect for the Cambodian people and their culture. Referring to his numerous talents, literary scholar Henri Copin has written: > Through these disciplines of learning and art he roamed majestically, like > that familiar Asiatic figure the elephant, all while exploring the past and > absorbing the present of the country that witnessed his birth and, > ultimately, his death. Drawing from this matchless wellspring of riches, he > was able to convey, in writings both knowledgeable and sensitive, the ties > and emotions that bound him to the land of the Khmer and its singular > culture. In addition to his extensive body of scholarly writings on the art, archaeology and history of the Khmer people of Cambodia, Groslier's books include detailed travelogues as well as works of fiction – such as the novel Retour à l'Argile (Return to Clay (1928)), which won Le prix de littérature colonial (Grand Prize of Colonial Literature) in 1929 – describing his impressions of, and interactions with, Cambodians. Both institutions he founded, the National Museum of Cambodia and the Royal University of Fine Arts, are still in operation today.  Biography  = Early life and education = In 1885, a French couple, civil servant Antoine-Georges Groslier and his wife Angélina (née Legrand), arrived in Cambodia to serve the French Protectorate. The Protectorate was established when King Norodom of Cambodia signed a treaty with France to protect his country from incursions by neighboring Siam (present-day Thailand) and Annam (present-day Vietnam). On February 4, 1887, a son, George Groslier, was born to the couple. In 1889, his mother became pregnant with a second child, but due to the primitive medical situation in Cambodia, she was forced to travel to Saigon for the delivery. She gave birth to a daughter, who immediately died, so Angélina decided to return to her family home in France to protect two-year-old George from the harsh climate and dangers of colonial life. Groslier began his education in Marseilles and discovered his talents for writing and painting. At the age of seven, he attended the Universal Exposition in Lyon, which featured exhibits on French Indochina, including Cambodia. He grew up with an awareness of and interest in the land in which he had been born, but no great desire to return there. In 1904, at the age of 17, George published his first book, a self- published poetry collection entitled La Chanson d'un Jeune (Song of a Youth). Beginning about 1905, Groslier attended the prestigious École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, studying under classical painter Albert Maignan, who was then in his sixties. (Groslier would dedicate his first book about Cambodia to the older painter.) In 1908, Maignan supported Groslier in his bid to compete in the challenging Prix de Rome art competition. A victory in this contest would have essentially ensured a successful career, but despite advancing further in the competition than had been the case with many famous artists (e.g. Eugène Delacroix, Gustave Moreau, Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas), Groslier was eliminated at the final level, and the young painter took this as a crushing defeat. However, this setback turned out to be a fortunate one, as it created the opportunity for his future career in Cambodia. = First project in Cambodia (1910–12) = In 1910, the Ministry of Public Education, whose head, Albert Sarraut, the future Prime Minister of France, would become his lifelong mentor and friend, commissioned Groslier to carry out an educational assignment in Cambodia. Upon his return to his birthplace, Groslier was soon working with prominent leaders in the field of Khmer archaeology, including Jean Commaille, Henri Parmentier and Henri Marchal. By all accounts, he was awed by his first glimpse of the ancient temples of Angkor Wat. As one scholar has said, \\"This vision of the grand Angkorean past was the wellspring of his love for Cambodia and its culture.\\" Through the Angkor Society for Conservation of the Ancient Monuments of Indochina, he also met the writers Charles Gravelle and Roland Meyer, whose interest in the sacred and royal art of Cambodian dance matched his own.  Cambodian Dancers  Portrait of George Groslier, from an advertisement for the wine Vin Mariani that appeared in the publication Femina (a French women's magazine issued from 1901 to 1954), shortly after the publication of his book on Cambodian dance. In addition to his administrative duties, Groslier initiated a scholarly study of Cambodia's unique traditional dance arts, the first that a European had ever undertaken. (Before Groslier, few French colonial scholars even mentioned dance in their analyses of Cambodian culture.) Although he witnessed just three evening performances for King Sisowath's birthday, and three additional \\"supplications\\" in the throne room, Groslier, with the special help of Gravelle, gained access to royal dancers and teachers connected to the king's court. He assembled hundreds of original sketches, numerous paintings and detailed written information, which he brought back with him to France. Funded by a subscription from the Minister of Colonies and the \\"High Patronage of His Majesty Sisowath, King of Cambodia,\\" Groslier published Danseuses Cambodgiennes – Anciennes et Modernes (Cambodian Dancers – Ancient and Modern) in Paris in 1913. Although the first edition totaled only 30 copies, this seminal work became, in one scholar's words, \\"the first commentary in any language – Asian or European – on one of the world’s most refined performing arts whose roots stretch to antiquity.\\" The book's value also lies in revealing performance practices for this art form that have since vanished. Groslier, for instance, noted in his book that wires were used to suspend some performers in mid-air during one of the performances he witnessed, which no longer occurs in Cambodian traditional dance performances today. = Second Project in Cambodia (1913–14) = Sarraut, the Minister of Public Education (and soon to be Governor General of Indochina), was so satisfied with Groslier's work that he issued him a new title: Chargé de Mission au Cambodge par le Ministère de l'Instruction publique et des Beaux- arts (Project Manager in Cambodia for the Minister of Public Education and Fine Arts). On April 1, 1913, George returned to Cambodia with new assignments. Over the remainder of 1913, he traveled the length and breadth of the country documenting the most remote Khmer monuments and recording his impressions and adventures. Groslier traveled on his own, isolated in remote jungles, rivers and mountains in primitive and demanding conditions, assisted only by native helpers. Some of the Khmer temples he documented included Wat Phu, Preah Vihear (to which he had to hike 50 kilometers on foot), Beng Mealea, Lolei, Bakong and Banteay Chhmar, as well as temples of the Angkor group, including Ta Prohm.  In the Shadow of Angkor  He published his experiences in his second book, A l'ombre d 'Angkor; notes et impressions sur les temples inconnus de l'ancien Cambodge (In the Shadow of Angkor: Notes and Impressions on the Unknown Temples of Ancient Cambodia), penning lively accounts that blended his subjective impressions with objective details. > [The Khmer people]… resemble this forest. Like her, they are full of > mystery. In their gestures, in their types, in their habits, in their > implements, you sometimes discover a vestige of ancient times surviving to > this day, mixed in with modern custom. You stumble upon it suddenly, as if > in the depths of a forest. It might be a jewel, a humble bit of pottery, the > shape of a statue’s lip, a corrupted word of Sanskrit. The whole country > holds vigil over its own sleeping past, deriving no profit from it, but > unwilling to let it go. As Maxime Prodromidès observes, what set George Groslier apart from other authors was his close contact with the Khmer people, with his passion split between the art and life of the country: > Is this a travel diary, a breviary of subjective archeology, an ethnological > meditation? Mixed works do not lend themselves to classification. Too much > science, cry the pure writers. Too much poetry, cry the scientists. Groslier > fortunately indulged in both, never minding the contradiction. Publication of the book was, however, delayed until 1916 due to the outbreak of the First World War. = World War I service = In June 1914, Groslier returned to France to enlist in the French army; the war began only weeks later. In 1915, Groslier was assigned to serve as a balloonist at Versailles Aerostation. Observation balloons were vital to the war effort as a means of aerial reconnaissance, and as these vehicles, for that reason, were favored targets for enemy fire, it was dangerous work. The French media at that time were encouraging French women to become pen pals with soldiers as a way of boosting morale. A relationship developed between Groslier and a pen pal named Suzanne Cecile Poujade, resulting in their marriage in Paris on May 27, 1916. (During this brief break from service, he arranged the publication of his second book on Cambodia.) From there, Groslier returned to his unit, the Fifth Squadron, now stationed in Bar-le-Duc, about 60 km south of Verdun. The town was the railhead and key supply point for the Battle of Verdun, a horrific conflict that left 250,000 dead and 500,000 wounded between February and December 1916. Although she was not authorized to accompany him, Suzanne made her way to the town to join him, using documents issued under her maiden name to avoid detection. In August 1916, Romania entered the war and Groslier was transferred to that front on an Air Force assignment in September, to work again under his mentor, Albert Sarraut, who was mission leader. On the long, circuitous trip, his ship was falsely reported sunk, causing great sorrow to everyone but his wife, who was certain he was alive. By the time he arrived safe and sound in Bucharest, he had been promoted to corporal. He spent the winter on the Eastern Front working as a courier. At about this time, the Russian Revolution began, and his wife noted somewhat nervously in her diary that \\"George bore some resemblance to Stalin.\\" After completing his duties, George went to Liverpool and then to Paris to be reunited with his wife. Albert Sarraut was then charged with assembling an Air Force team in the Far East and, knowing Groslier was familiar with Cambodia and was fluent in the Khmer language, Sarraut had him reassigned to this mission in April 1917. Groslier headed back to French Indochina, accompanied by Suzanne. = Professional life in Cambodia = alt=A middle-aged man wearing a suit and spectacles is seated at a desk, examining some papers. Upon Groslier's arrival in Phnom Penh in May 1917, Sarraut, now Governor General of Indochina, terminated his military service. He charged him with two new missions: to found a museum of Cambodian art and to organize a school of Cambodian arts. Sarraut believed that the future of colonial rule lay not in assimilating cultures but, in his words, in \\"understanding [them] so that they may evolve, under our tutelage, in the framework of their civilization.\\" In the words of one scholar: \\"From 1917 to 1942, Groslier had shaped his career as a rescue mission and established institutions, principally an art school and museum, which he described as a life raft to save Cambodia’s national arts from vanishing... Those arts he had only years ago described as 'immortal' now seemed to Groslier to be on the verge of vanishing.\\" (From this point to the end of his life, Groslier continually resided in Cambodia, returning to Europe only for brief vacations or for educational initiatives on behalf of his professional mission, e.g., the 1931 Paris International Exposition (see below).) Groslier proved brilliant at the public relations challenge of rallying French colonial public opinion (and the administration) to the cause of saving Cambodian art. He portrayed Cambodian culture as being as venerable and exalted as French culture and bemoaned the fact that \\"everything here that has withstood time, wars, and religions has now succumbed to civilization... Our steamships and automobiles generate a smoke in which champa flowers wither...\\" In the summer of 1917, Groslier initiated a national survey to quantify the state of traditional arts, and produced a report that predictably painted a very pessimistic picture of its present condition.  Founding of the Museum of Cambodia  alt=A building in traditional Cambodian style, in front of which is a path and garden. Groslier drafted the architectural plans for the Museum of Cambodia (Musée du Cambodge), known from 1920 as the Albert Sarraut Museum, which opened its doors to the public during the Cambodia New Year on April 13, 1920. (It continues to operate today as the National Museum of Cambodia.) His vision, shared and supported by Sarraut and by his peers, was for the museum to build traditional collections from the full range of Cambodia’s ancient works of art, including sculptures, bronzes, inscriptions, ceramics, jewelry, fragments of monuments, wooden objects, paintings and manuscripts. Simultaneously he enlisted Cambodians in preserving their own heritage by providing an organization to catalog the nation’s historical resources \\"to give all Khmers a stake in that past.\\"  Establishing the School of Cambodian Arts  As the museum preserved Cambodia’s past, Groslier organized the School of Cambodian Arts (École des Arts Cambodgiens, now known as the Royal University of Fine Arts), next to the museum, to serve the future by training new generations of artists. Groslier's explicit goal was, as he expressed it, to \\"do nothing but Cambodian art in the Cambodian way.\\" Within the school, George established a series of workshops or guilds based on the \\"six great arts of Cambodia\\" including jewelry, painting and temple planning, metal work and casting, sculpture, furniture making and carpentry and weaving. Groslier went on to organize the guilds to produce and sell Cambodian art through a worldwide network, enabling artists to gain an income and self-sufficiency. He also encouraged them to produce reproductions of traditional Khmer masterpieces as a way of satisfying foreign tourists' hunger for souvenirs, and thus discourage the foreigners from stealing the original artworks of the country. This arts program, according to Copin, served the interests of the colonial power, France; however, \\"it also served the interests of Cambodia, spotlighting the kingdom as a unique entity within the landscape of Indochina, and fostering an assemblage of a national cultural heritage that is today fundamental to Khmer identity.\\" Though the two institutions were administered by Frenchmen (including of course, Groslier), he pursued his own agenda by transferring true control of both to Cambodians. In 1917, he installed the former royal architect Tep Nimit Mak as an administrator of the school, and later assembled, with great difficulty, Cambodian master artists to teach. As the institution grew, Groslier maintained his hands-off approach. As Ingrid Muan describes: > Despite his own training as a painter, Groslier would never teach at the > school. \\"I am not Khmer,\\" he declared, and the \\"fundamental principle\\" of > the School was \\"only to make Cambodian art and only to have it be made by > Cambodians.\\" The one restriction placed upon these \\"masters\\" was that they > \\"purge all Western influence\\" from their teaching.... \\"We don’t expand on > the pedagogical methods of the [Cambodian] master,\\" Groslier declared: \\"No > change is to be brought to their habits, their working methods, or the > materials they use.\\" The doctrine of the \\"impenetrable sphere\\" of pure > \\"Cambodian art\\" is shown clearly by the absence of French personnel in > official photos taken of the School and its students shortly after it was > put under Groslier and his French colleagues. In 1923, a visiting French journalist, François de Tessan, arrived at the school and came away with a very favorable impression of both the school and Groslier, who proudly described to de Tessan its dedicated masters and students: > \\"As you can see,\\" [Groslier] told me, \\"we have settled in and are well > equipped. But for two years, at its very beginnings, the School of Arts was > functioning in a dark, nondescript warehouse a third the size of what was > needed... Every night during the rainy season we had to remove every piece > of silk from the looms, because of leaks in our worm-eaten roof. It was a > tedious task for masters and students alike. We had recruited a handful of > professors and artisans to get the classes going. Not one failed to show up. > Not one quit their job. Not a one. In fact, these educators were so > enthusiastic that they refused their vacations. Outside its walls, all of > them promoted the school, recruited students and sought ancient and rare > objects.\\" Groslier's approach was exactly the opposite of that of the founders of another Indochinese institution, the Hanoi-based School of Fine Arts of Indochina (École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de l’Indochine), which sought to train Asian students in Western modes of art, rather than native styles.  André Malraux incident  alt=A seated, young, dark-haired man in a suit, photographed from above, is shown writing on a sheet of paper on a desk while staring straight up at the camera. In 1923, Groslier proved his commitment to preserving Cambodia's heritage when he organized the arrest of André Malraux, the future novelist and French Minister of Cultural Affairs. In France in 1919, when he was eighteen years old, the young Malraux had eagerly read an article by Groslier's friend, Parmentier, that appeared in an official publication by L’École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), describing the impressive temple monuments of Cambodia, including those at a 10th Century temple, Banteay Srei (The Temple of Women). The article revealed the site as neglected and overgrown with vegetation. Apparently, Malraux, before he left France, made a detailed study of the applicable laws and determined (at least to his own satisfaction) that the site was abandoned property to which no one could stake legal claim. In the summer of 1923, at the age of 22, he set out for Indochina with his wife, Clara, and a colleague, Louis Chevasson. The party concealed their true purpose – to take priceless traditional art objects and sell them to a European art museum – by pretending to be mere sightseeing tourists and scholars. Malraux had even received special permission from the authorities to explore the Banteay Srei site. However, upon meeting Groslier, Malraux inadvertently aroused the former's suspicions by referring repeatedly to the \\"commercial value\\" of the pieces in the Sarraut Museum. On December 23, in his boat, the Hainan, Malraux arrived at Banteay Srei, seized four priceless statues depicting devata, which he divided into pieces and put into crates, and headed south, intending to ship his cargo to Thailand. Groslier, who had been tipped off, reached Kampong Chnang by car just as Malraux' boat arrived, went on board, identified the devata (in falsely-labeled crates), and arranged for the police to arrest the perpetrators as soon as they arrived at Phnom Penh that evening. The incident created an enormous scandal in both colonial Indochina and France itself, despite the fact that Malraux was, at that time, virtually unknown outside French literary circles. As Copin puts it, \\"the controversial court cases that ensued shook the colonial administration from Indochina to Paris.\\" In July of the following year, Malraux was sentenced to three years and Chevasson to 18 months in prison. However, there were many irregularities in the conduct of the case by the prosecution. It created a \\"secret dossier,\\" withheld from the defense, with which it sought to demonize Malraux and Chevasson by their association with left-wing bohemians, whom it called \\"Bolsheviks,\\" and by the fact of Clara's Jewish origins. Furthermore, the basic legal case against Malraux was very questionable. It was true that the Governor General of Indochina had designated EFEO as the protector of Indochinese archeological sites and forbade anyone except members of EFEO from taking any artifacts out of the country. However, Banteay Srei had never been officially designated as a protected site. In the words of scholar Lindsay French, \\"Malraux, furious that EFEO should have such a monopoly over the temples, argued that since Banteay Srei had never been specifically 'classified' as a monument to be preserved, the stones were not legal artifacts and [therefore] there was no [legal] basis for his arrest.\\" alt=Ancient Cambodian open-air temple, featuring four statues of seated figures in the middle distance. Over 50 prominent literary figures in France signed a petition for the release of the men. Both sentences were later reduced on appeal, and the men were eventually allowed to return to France without serving any jail time. Malraux depicted himself as the victim in the affair, as he sincerely believed that, in taking the statues, he had been acting within the law as it then existed. At least one commentator agrees that Malraux and his accomplice were treated harshly: \\"...if these two young men were to be imprisoned for taking the sculpture from Banteay Srei, should not the same penalty be exacted from the various Governors, High Commissioners, and administrators of Indochina who had done the very same thing to similar monuments?\\" The incident had two repercussions. It prompted the colonial administration to belatedly begin a serious restoration of the decrepit Banteay Srei site, headed by Groslier’s friend Parmentier, whose earlier article had brought the site to Malraux’ attention in the first place. And Malraux, because he perceived himself to be the victim of what he regarded as corrupt colonial forces, began to champion the cause of the Indochinese people against the French colonists, establishing the previously apolitical artist as a serious left-wing author. One scholar defines the Banteay Srei incident and its aftermath as \\"how Malraux became Malraux.\\" In 1930, he incorporated aspects of the incident into a novel about two looters journeying through the Cambodian jungle in search of treasure, titled La Voie royale. (In 1935, the book appeared in English as The Royal Way.) Although Groslier's daughter recalls that her father privately referred to Malraux as le petit voleur (\\"the little thief\\"), he never otherwise spoke of the incident, perhaps agreeing that Malraux, though guilty of stealing, had been treated unfairly by the court.  Scholarly and literary work  Groslier was a very prolific writer throughout his career, but the period between the mid-1920s through the early-1930s was particularly productive for him. In the second half of 1924, he published Angkor, and in 1925, he published two books: La Sculpture khmère ancienne (Ancient Khmer Sculpture) and a massive two-volume work, Arts et Archéologie Khmers (Khmer Arts and Archeology). On September 17, 1929, his wife and children set out on a voyage to a home that the family owned in France, where they would remain for three years. Four days later, Groslier began a solitary journey from Phnom Penh via the Mekong River, ostensibly to inspect pagodas along his route, but actually to record, for a literary work, his impressions of the river, its wildlife and the people along its banks. (He made a second, similar journey in early 1930.) The result was the book Eaux et lumières; journal de route sur le Mékong cambodgien (Waters and Lights: Journal of a Voyage on the Cambodian Mekong), published in 1931. Copin offers a highly laudatory description of the book's approach: > In these pages the reader journeys alongside a double character, split > between the learned archeologist, carrying out a government mission, and the > adoptive son of Cambodia, by turns critical and empathetic as he sizes up > the creatures he meets: river fishermen, peasants, bonzes, old women who > will not be sweet-talked by this European who speaks their tongue and > behaves for all the world like a native son of the land. We proceed from > discovery to discovery, from temple and ruin to the minutia of daily life, > from the droll to the picturesque, and see it all through the eyes of a > deeply cultured man, there to illuminate every encounter. Could one hope for > a more captivating or wonderful guide? It was also during this period that he added another title to his long list of accomplishments: novelist. In 1926, he published his first novel, La Route du plus fort (The Road of the Strongest), an overview of colonialism more critical than he could ever have made in his scholarly works. Two years later, he published his most acclaimed work of fiction Le Retour à l’argile (Return to Clay). In his earlier book, In the Shadow of Angkor, he had indicated that he had no desire to write about Phnom Penh, as it was of little interest to him in comparison with the country's ancient temples. But by the time he wrote this novel, his attitude had changed radically. In this story about a French engineer who takes a Cambodian mistress, he sympathetically describes native urban life, contrasting it favorably with the world of Grolier's fellow Western colonists. > Many races had slowly wrought this people over the centuries. The Chinese > had lightened the complexion, and the Siamese [i.e., Thais] and the > Annamites [i.e., Vietnamese] had refined its forms, after the Aryan, > perhaps, had widened its eyes. And thus the country abounded, end to end, > with lovely girls, robust and complex, generated through these successive > grafts, ripened in the heat, their nudity polished in childhood by the air > and the waters... One would see no gesture, pose or movement that was not > essential and harmonious with the surroundings — each so immediate, so > supple, so deft, so spare, drawing on the atmosphere for buoyancy, and on > nothing but ambient light for finery. To those with open eyes, this living > beauty is all the more engrossing for its presence in all places and at all > times. The book received the Grand Prize of Colonial Literature (Le prix de littérature coloniale) in 1929, but afterwards fell into obscurity, until its re-release in modern French and English editions.  1931 International Exposition in Paris  Groslier played a major role in preparing the Cambodian exhibitions for the Colonial Exposition that opened in Vincennes, just outside Paris, on May 6, 1931. The event was designed to be the most spectacular colonial show in history. However, it occurred at a time when the entire concept of colonialism — what the French called their mission civilisatrice (civilizing mission) — was increasingly seen by many, in the words of Groslier's biographer, Kent Davis, \\"less as altruism and more as a quest for power and profit.\\" Groslier, however, who saw the exposition as an opportunity to open world markets to Cambodian art, wanted the work of Cambodian artists to be the highlight of this expo. The focal point of the exhibition was a full-sized reproduction of the top level of Angkor Wat, reconstructed in the center of Paris, as well as a Cambodian pavilion that was > planned by Groslier in collaboration with the architect of the Exposition > and members of the Department of Public Works (whom Groslier claimed did > nothing). Decorative details and the sculpted wood entrance of the building > were completed by ateliers at the School of Cambodian Arts... The entire > middle gallery of the exhibition space was reserved for \\"Arts cambodgiens.\\" Suzanne Groslier's notes confirm that preparations for the exhibition began a year in advance of the official opening, so that the Cambodian exhibition was ready before those of any of the other participants. Despite the ongoing worldwide Depression, the exposition, which attracted 33 million visitors, was a resounding success for Cambodian art. In fact, such a demand for indigenous Cambodian crafts was created that a permanent sales office for such items was opened in Paris. = Marriage and family life = Suzanne Poujade, Groslier's wife, was born in Paris in 1893. (By a strange coincidence, Albert Sarraut, Groslier's future mentor and employer, was a friend of the Poujade family.) She had been very thin as a child and a doctor had recommended sports as therapy. As a result, in her teens she trained in both ice skating and tennis and became a champion at both. With her skating partner, a man named Pigueron, she won five gold medals at the national championships and several medals at the Paris city championships. In tennis, she competed in the world championships in 1914, and won three gold medals. At the outbreak of the war, Suzanne headed for Lavaur in southwest France, where some of her father's family lived and where she worked as a nurse for the war effort. It was while staying in the area, both to pass the time and to do something novel for their country, that she and some friends decided to participate in the marraine de guerre (War Godmother) program, in which civilian women established pen pal relationships with soldiers at the front. After Suzanne's friends had chosen their pen pals, Suzanne took a letter from balloonist George Groslier and began a correspondence with him. As noted above, Suzanne and George fell in love and were married in May 1916. This was not unusual: many pen pal relationships begun by the War Godmother program ended in marriage. The couple had three children, all of whom were born in Cambodia like their father: * Nicole, born June 15, 1918 (godfather: Albert Sarraut) * Gilbert, born September 8, 1922 * Bernard-Philippe, born May 10, 1926. The last child, , would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a renowned archaeologist and curator of the National Museum of Cambodia. During the children's youth, they spent much time in France at the family home there and attending school. In June 1939, just before the outbreak of a new war, Suzanne traveled to France with young Bernard (Gilbert had already been in the country for several years as a high school student), while Nicole remained behind with her father. In June 1940, the Nazis invaded France, and Suzanne and her sons eventually took refuge in unoccupied (Vichy) southern France, whose administration still controlled the French colonies, including Cambodia. However, because of the war, sea travel between France and Southeast Asia was disrupted, and neither Suzanne, Gilbert, nor Bernard would ever see Groslier again. = Japanese occupation and death = alt=A mid-length portrait of a man of about 30 in a conservative suit and wearing a moustache, facing the camera. In July 1940, the Vichy government appointed Admiral Jean Decoux as Governor-General of Indochina. On September 22, under heavy pressure from Germany, Decoux signed a treaty giving Japanese forces free movement through the area, effectively ending resistance against them. Although the Vichy regime continued to administer Indochina, the Japanese, which stationed a garrison of 8,000 troops in Cambodia, were the true masters of the region. However, because France was officially, at that time, an ally of Japan, Cambodia temporarily avoided the violence and disorder that was tearing apart so much of the rest of the world, and the life of the French colonists, although more isolated from the outside world, went on more or less as before. It was during this period that Groslier, who was still in his fifties, retired. At this time, also, the Japanese became increasingly interested in Cambodian culture, particularly Angkor. A translation of Groslier's 1924 book on the subject, Angkor, was published by a Japanese press in Tokyo under the title Ankōru no iseki (Ruins of Angkor). The political situation changed drastically in August 1944, when Paris was liberated by Allied forces. The Vichy government shortly afterwards collapsed. (Groslier's son, Bernard, participated actively in the French Resistance.) In Asia, too, the Allies were encroaching upon the increasingly desperate Japanese. On March 9, 1945, Japanese authorities, promising autonomy to the local population, overthrew the French colonial regime, and four days later King Sihanouk declared Cambodia's independence from France and its alliance with the crumbling Japanese Empire. The Japanese proceeded to round up all foreign nationals in the country, including Groslier and his daughter, and place them in concentration camps. As Nicole Groslier describes it: > We were all herded to a concentration camp and forced to stay there, in that > small camp. Men and women were separated. I did not see my father. I was > alone. Many people in the camp became so ugly. Greedy. Mean. There were > arguments over food, money and supplies. This bothered me so much. Since at least the 1930s, Groslier had been a passionate shortwave radio enthusiast. (A photo dating from 1933 reveals his rather sophisticated system, and it may have become more elaborate in the intervening years.) This fact aroused the suspicions of the Japanese authorities, who feared that Groslier might be using his radio to help anti-occupation forces within the country. Nicole later insisted that her father used his radio solely to listen to music. However, Copin remarks that he \\"apparently supported local resistance efforts,\\" and Davis concedes that this was at least possible, though not proven. Eyewitnesses in the camp report that the Japanese military police, the Kempeitai, interrogated Groslier, tortured him, and returned him to his cell dead or dying on the morning of June 18, 1945. Nicole, who had not been notified of her father's fate, was called into the office of the camp commander. Without a word, the man gestured in the direction of a nearby table. On or near the table were her father's last remains: his eyeglasses, a pair of shoes and his ashes in a box. She retrieved the objects and left. \\"My God,\\" she later wrote, \\"I was frightened and lonely that day.\\" After Indochina was re-occupied by the French (with Bernard as part of this invading force), Groslier's ashes were sent to France, where they are now interred.  Legacy  alt=A cast-iron statue of a man in a suit with a hat in his lap, seated upon a chair also of cast iron; the wall and roof of a building is visible in the background. On October 4, 1946, Governor Penn Nouth of Phnom Penh honored Groslier by inaugurating rue Groslier (\\"Groslier Street\\") in front of the National Museum, saying > If there is a Frenchman whom destiny seems purposely to have selected to > become a link between Cambodia and France — one of those bonds of mind and > heart that no one, whatever his politics, can permit himself to denounce — > that Frenchman's name is George Groslier. Historian Penny Edwards observes that, though there is no longer a rue Groslier, \\"the palace and the arts school still grace the skyline.\\" However, in 2019 an initiative was started to rename this street in memory of Georges Groslier, with various expressions of support or objection.https://www.khmertimeskh.com/650143/restoring-the-name-of-the- cambodia-scholar/ On May 5, 1947, the French government officially recognized Groslier as \\"Mort pour la France,\\" a term traditionally used for military personnel and civilians, killed during a period of French military conflict, who are considered to have died in service to their country. In 2008, DatAsia Press editor Kent Davis began working with Nicole Groslier and her family, documenting her father’s life, translating a number of his books to English, and restoring them to print, as listed in the bibliography below. In October 2015, the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh honored Groslier with a statue next to H. M. Sisowath on the school grounds.  Awards and honors  During his lifetime, Groslier won many awards and honors from many different counties. Davis quotes historian Joel Montague as saying that Groslier was \\"a bit of an oddity\\" in that he won his awards not over a short span of time, but throughout his life, from his teens to his fifties, as well as in the fact that he was given them for widely divergent activities and services: for painting, for writing, for museum work, for charity, and from the governments of France, Cambodia, Laos and Annam (Vietnam). Davis points out yet another interesting fact: in the more than 100 surviving photos of Groslier, he never appears wearing any of his many decorations.

Early life and education  Burgess was born in Cleveland, Ohio on April 3, 1912 to William Andrews and Alice Ball Andrews. Burgess spent one year of post-secondary matriculation at Mills College and another at Case Western Reserve University, where she majored in art history. During this time she was very active in the League of Women Votes, where she was elected President of her chapter. Burgess' passion for the arts and civil service led her to take up several prominent roles in the Phoenix community after her relocation to Phoenix, Arizona in the late 1940s. There, she again became active in the LWV, eventually becoming the Phoenix Chapter Secretary. Burgess was elected to the Heard Museum's Secretary to the Board of Directors, a position that eventually led to her founding of the Phoenix Art Council, which in turn granted her membership in the Phoenix Art Museum.  Personal life  In 1939, Burgess married Richard Burgess, who at the time was a certified public accountant and held a managing partnership at the Alexander Grant Company. The couple had three children, Richard B. Burgess, Thomas H. Burgess and Susan Burgess Cordsen, before their divorce in 1967. Richard Burgess died in 1977.  Political career  As Burgess' local recognition came to a head with her foundation of the Phoenix Art Council, prominent Phoenix republicans began to encourage her to become involved in the Arizona Republican Party, which led to her foundation of a Republican Party Group in her district. Burgess was encouraged to run for the Arizona Legislature in 1952. = Arizona State Legislature (1953–1969) = Burgess served five consecutive terms from 1953 to 1967 in the Arizona House of Representatives representing Maricopa District 8E. During her tenure in the House, she served as Chair of the Highways and Transportation Committee and as Chair of the Joint Senate and House Interim Transportation Committee. She was also a member of the Board of Governors for the Council of State Governments, as well as the Chair of the National Legislative Transportation Committee. She then ran for and won a seat in the Arizona State Senate from 1967, becoming the first Republican women to do so. There, she became the Chair of the Arizona State Senate Highway and Transportation Committee. Burgess would only serve a fraction of one term in the Arizona Senate, however, as she was nominated by President Richard Nixon in 1969 to the National Transportation Safety Board after a recommendation from Senator Barry Goldwater and Representative John Rhodes. At the time, her leadership as the Chair of the National Legislative Transportation Committee and being a woman made her an ideal candidate for nomination. Future Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was appointed to fill her vacancy in the Senate on October 30 of the same year. = National Transportation Safety Board (1969–1976) = A hearing on Burgess' nomination was heard by the Senate Committee on Commerce on October 3, 1969, with her approval won shortly thereafter. During her tenure, Burgess oversaw several crucial events in transportation safety and evolution, including the ALM Flight 980 crash in 1970. Overall, Burgess oversaw 17 major NTSB investigations, as well as 12 official hearings. Burgess was noted for her frequent domestic and international speeches advocating for better safety in the transportation industry, both in the private and government sectors. Burgess focused most of her time on the Board towards cabin safety on aircraft, better galley and gallery security, jumpseat safety, and an unprecedented platform advocating for better evacuation slides and emergency interior lighting. In 1971, she was named \\"Outstanding Woman in the Field of Life Support\\" by the Survival and Flight Equipment Association. She was also named an honorary member of the Flight Attendants Association in 1972 for her work towards greater transportation safety. Burgess served on the NTSB until 1976.Arizona State Library-Arizona State Legislators: Then and Now-Isabel Burgess'Isabel Andrews Burgess Former Ariz. senator-obituary,' Elyria Chronicle Telegram (Ohio), September 22, 1999, pg. 22  Later life and death  After serving on the NTSB, Burgess briefly served in the Department of the Interior as Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Energy and Minerals starting in 1976, before she retired permanently from civil service in January 1977. In 1991, Burgess moved back to Arizona from her residence in Washington, DC. Burgess died on September 17, 1999 in Scottsdale, Arizona from breast cancer, and is buried in Cleveland, Ohio.

Trinity Green Almshouses (formerly Trinity Hospital) are a series of Grade I listed almshouses on Mile End Road in Whitechapelhttp://spitalfieldslife.com/2018/03/20/new-hope-for-trinity-green- almshouses/ in London. They were originally built in 1695 to provide housing for retired sailors, and are the oldest almshouses in Central London. The buildings were damaged during the Second World War, and were restored in the 1950s by London County Council. History The Trinity Green Almshouses were built in 1695 by the Corporation of Trinity House to provide housing for \\"28 decay’d Masters & Commanders of Ships or ye Widows of such\\"; the land was given to the Corporation by Captain Henry Mudd of Ratcliffe. The almshouses are believed to have been designed by Sir William Ogbourne, and the houses were organised into two rows, with a central green and chapel. The chapel is in the parish of St Dunstan's, Stepney. In 1735, Trinity Green had 28 people, at a cost of 12 shillings per resident per month. In 1895–96, Trinity Green was threatened with closure, after Sir Frederic Leighton proposed that the almshouses be destroyed. The closure was prevented due to a public campaign led by Charles Robert Ashbee, who set up a Committee for the Survey of the Memorials of Greater London. The almshouses were the first buildings to be put on his preservation register, which eventually became the listed building system. In 1927, a bronze bust memorial for William Booth was installed at Trinity Green; in the 19th century, Booth had preached in the Vine Tavern in front of the almshouses, which had led to the founding of The Salvation Army. In the Second World War, the Trinity Green almshouses were damaged, with those almshouses north of the chapel being destroyed. In 1950, Trinity Green became a Grade I listed building; the listing included the almshouses, chapel, gates, railings and walls. In 1954, London County Council bought and restored the non-destroyed houses, including the restoration of the chapel with 18th- century panelling from Bradmore House in Hammersmith. When Mile End Road was built, Trinity Green's location was altered from rural peace and quiet into traffic. Trinity Green was included on a Mile End mural created in 2011. In 2016, local residents complained at proposals for Sainsbury's to build a 28-storey tower block less than from the Trinity Green almshouses; they argued that the tower block would cast a shadow over the almshouses.

He soon moved to Brisbane where he was educated at Nundah State School and Brisbane Grammar School before attending the Brisbane Technical College where he earned a Diploma of Sugar Chemistry. He worked as a sugar chemist at various sugar mills in Queensland and during World War Two, Jensen worked as a chemist at munitions factories in Maribyrnong and St Marys. On 30 May 1941 he married Olive Margaret Magee and together had two daughters. Jensen died in Bundaberg in July 2003. Public career When the Independent member for Bundaberg, Ted Walsh, retired at the 1969 Queensland state election, Jensen, a member of the Labor Party, won the seat. He held Bundaberg until the 1977 state election when he was defeated by Jim Blake. For the last few weeks of his political career he sat as an Independent. This was due to the Labor Party increasing its members' levy from two per cent to 3.5 per cent in order to increase funds. Jensen raised the matter in the House and as a result was subsequently disendorsed by the party for the 1977 election in favour of Blake. He once wore a red T-shirt into parliament with \\"I'm a Labor rebel man\\" written on it to win a $50 bet with a friend. He was the Shadow Minister for Lands, Forestry and Water Resources during 1975–1976.

Education Slaughter-Harvey studied at Hawkins High School where she graduated valedictorian in 1963. She received her bachelor's degree in political science and economics from Tougaloo College with cum laude honors. She met civil rights activist Medgar Evers while she was in college and his assassination in 1963 influenced Slaughter-Harvey to pursue a law degree. After graduation, she enrolled at the University of Mississippi School of Law where she was the first African-American female to graduate in 1970.  Career  At the age of 24, Slaughter-Harvey was instrumental in integrating the ranks of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol, which led to the integration of HP's across the nation. After receiving her law degree in 1970, the honorable Constance Slaughter-Harvey sued the state of Mississippi for racial discrimination. In response, Mississippi added the first three black state troopers to their ranks. Constance noted that the Mississippi Highway Patrol was the strong arm of the law for the Ku Klux Klan. She used her law degree to push to get that changed. Her efforts in Mississippi opened the door for black men to serve as state troopers all across the US. Indicative of her life’s dedication to serving others and forcing positive change, Slaughter-Harvey was so involved in the Highway Patrol lawsuit that she missed her own law school graduation ceremony. Slaughter-Harvey was picked to serve as Scott County Court Judge in 1976 in a case involving a party previously represented byJudge Guyton Idom. This appointment made her the first female black judge in the state of Mississippi. She also served as a member of the Governor's Minority Advisory Committee and a Presidential Scholars Commissioner during the administration of President Jimmy Carter.

Biography He was born at Polistena in Calabria, in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. He trained locally under his grandfather, a sculptor, but moved to Naples where he frequented the Neapolitan Academy of Fine Arts under Tito Angelini. In 1878, he displayed sculptures of Eve and Lucifer and Guappatiello (Neapolitan Street Boy) in 1878 at the Neapolitan Exhibition. In 1880, he displayed sculptures of Victa (bust), Marion, and the Legionnaires of Germanicus at the National Exhibition in Turin. The Legionnaire sculpture was interpreted by the critic Salazar as a response to the Hermannsdenkmal, then a recently erected monument in Germany to Arminius, the Germanic general that vanquished the Roman Varro in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Germanicus was viewed by later historians as Augustus' response to the defeat as well as the loss of the legionary eagles, and called the Avenger of Varro. One soldier blows a horn, the other raises a flag, and the third inscribes on stone the defeated Germania; about them is the booty of war.The Art Journal, Volume 61, An Eminent Italian Sculptor Francesco Jerace, by Lorenzo Salazar, pages 107. The statue won first prize at Turin. In 1894, he displayed a sculpture of Vittoria Colonna at the Exhibition of the Brera Academy. In 1895, he displayed a controversial sculpture of Beethoven at the Venice International Exhibition. The sculpture, now in a cloister of the Music Conservatory San Pietro a Majella, depicts the composer reclining upon a large, rough rock. Restless, turning to the side, he peers to the distance with a composition on paper strewn on the rock. Monument to Beethoven, San Pietro a Majella, Naples In 1899 he married Vittoria Eisner Von Eisenhof. Jerace's Monument to Donizetti, inaugurated in 1897, is sited in a public garden, adjacent to the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo. In the monument, the composer is seated on an otherwise empty bench, composing with his eyes close, while he listens to a lyric muse who stands or floats nearby.Scultura Italiana , biography.The Italy of the Italians, by Helen Zimmern, page 130-131. Monument to Donizetti, Bergamo Jerace also sculpted a statue of Vittorio Emmanuele II (1888) for facade of the Royal Palace of Naples, and sculpted a monument to the English astronomer and mathematician, Mary Somerville, in the Protestant cemetery at Naples. He also completed a series of bas-reliefs for churches and monuments. He created a monuments to the fallen (Monumento ai Caduti) for the town of Polistena and the city of Reggio Calabria.

It follows from the definition of culture as \\"information capable of affecting individuals' behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation and other forms of social transmission\\". Cultural evolution is the change of this information over time. Cultural evolution, historically also known as sociocultural evolution, was originally developed in the 19th century by anthropologists stemming from Charles Darwin's research on evolution. Today, cultural evolution has become the basis for a growing field of scientific research in the social sciences, including anthropology, economics, psychology and organizational studies. Previously, it was believed that social change resulted from biological adaptations, but anthropologists now commonly accept that social changes arise in consequence of a combination of social, evolutionary and biological influences. There have been a number of different approaches to the study of cultural evolution, including dual inheritance theory, sociocultural evolution, memetics, cultural evolutionism and other variants on cultural selection theory. The approaches differ not just in the history of their development and discipline of origin but in how they conceptualize the process of cultural evolution and the assumptions, theories and methods that they apply to its study. In recent years, there has been a convergence of the cluster of related theories towards seeing cultural evolution as a unified discipline in its own right. History Aristotle thought that development of cultural form (such as poetry) stops when it reaches its maturity. In 1873 in Harper's New Monthly Magazine, it was written: \\"By the principle which Darwin describes as natural selection short words are gaining the advantage over long words, direct forms of expression are gaining the advantage over indirect, words of precise meaning the advantage of the ambiguous, and local idioms are everywhere in disadvantage\\".The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood, by James Gleic, 2012, p. 174 Cultural evolution, in the Darwinian sense of variation and selective inheritance, could be said to trace back to Darwin himself.Richerson, P.J. and Boyd. R. (2010) The Darwinian theory of human cultural evolution and gene-culture coevolution. Chapter 20 in Evolution Since Darwin: The First 150 Years. M.A. Bell, D.J. Futuyma, W.F. Eanes, and J.S. Levinton, (eds.) Sinauer, pp. 561-588. He argued for both customs (1874 p. 239) and \\"inherited habits\\" as contributing to human evolution, grounding both in the innate capacity for acquiring language.Price, I. (2012b) Organizational Ecologies and Declared Realities, In K. Alexander and I. Price (eds.) Managing Organizational Ecologies: Space, Management and Organization. New York, Routledge, 11-22. Darwin's ideas, along with those of such as Comte and Quetelet, influenced a number of what would now be called social scientists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Hodgson and KnudsenHodgson, G.M. and Knudsen, T. (2010). Darwin's Conjecture: The Search for General Principles of Social and Economic Evolution. Chicago, University of Chicago Press. single out David George Ritchie and Thorstein Veblen, crediting the former with anticipating both dual inheritance theory and universal Darwinism. Despite the stereotypical image of social Darwinism that developed later in the century, neither Ritchie nor Veblen were on the political right. The early years of the 20th century and particularly the First World War saw biological concepts and metaphors shunned by most social sciences. Even uttering the word evolution carried \\"serious risk to one's intellectual reputation.\\" Darwinian ideas were also in decline following the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics but were revived, especially by Fisher, Haldane and Wright, who developed the first population genetic models and as it became known the modern synthesis. Cultural evolutionary concepts, or even metaphors, revived more slowly. If there were one influential individual in the revival it was probably Donald T. Campbell. In 1960 he drew on Wright to draw a parallel between genetic evolution and the \\"blind variation and selective retention\\" of creative ideas; work that was developed into a full theory of \\"socio-cultural evolution\\" in 1965Campbell, D. T. (1965). \\"Variation and selective retention in socio- cultural evolution\\". Social Change in Developing Areas, a Reinterpretation of Evolutionary Theory. (a work that includes references to other works in the then current revival of interest in the field). Campbell (1965 26) was clear that he perceived cultural evolution not as an analogy \\"from organic evolution per se, but rather from a general model for quasiteleological processes for which organic evolution is but one instance\\". Others pursued more specific analogies notably the anthropologist F. T. (Ted) Cloak who argued in 1975Cloak, F. T. (1975). \\"Is a Cultural Ethology Possible?\\". Human Ecology 3(3) 161–182. for the existence of learnt cultural instructions (cultural corpuscles or i-culture) resulting in material artefacts (m-culture) such as wheels.Cloak, F. T. (1968). \\"Cultural Darwinism: Natural selection of the spoked wheel\\" The argument thereby introduced as to whether cultural evolution requires neurological instructions continues to the present day . = Unilinear theory = In the 19th century cultural evolution was thought to follow a unilineal pattern whereby all cultures progressively develop over time. The underlying assumption was that Cultural Evolution itself led to the growth and development of civilization. Thomas Hobbes in the 17th Century declared indigenous culture to have \\"no arts, no letters, no society\\" and he described facing life as \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\" He, like other scholars of his time, reasoned that everything positive and esteemed resulted from the slow development away from this poor lowly state of being. Under the theory of unilinear Cultural Evolution, all societies and cultures develop on the same path. The first to present a general unilineal theory was Herbert Spencer. Spencer suggested that humans develop into more complex beings as culture progresses, where people originally lived in \\"undifferentiated hordes\\" culture progresses and develops to the point where civilization develops hierarchies. The concept behind unilinear theory is that the steady accumulation of knowledge and culture leads to the separation of the various modern day sciences and the build-up of cultural norms present in modern-day society. In Lewis H. Morgan's book Ancient Society (1877), Morgan labels seven differing stages of human culture: lower, middle, and upper savagery; lower, middle, and upper barbarism; and civilization. He justifies this staging classification by referencing societies whose cultural traits resembled those of each of his stage classifications of the cultural progression. Morgan gave no example of lower savagery, as even at the time of writing few examples remained of this cultural type. At the time of expounding his theory, Morgan's work was highly respected and became a foundation for much of anthropological study that was to follow.  Cultural particularism  There began a widespread condemnation of unilinear theory in the late 19th century. Unilinear cultural evolution implicitly assumes that culture was borne out of the United States and Western Europe. That was seen by many to be racist, as it assumed that some individuals and cultures were more evolved than others. Franz Boas, a German-born anthropologist, was the instigator of the movement known as 'cultural particularism' in which the emphasis shifted to a multilinear approach to cultural evolution. That differed to the unilinear approach that used to be favoured in the sense that cultures were no longer compared, but they were assessed uniquely. Boas, along with several of his pupils, notably A.L. Kroeber, Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead, changed the focus of anthropological research to the effect that instead of generalizing cultures, the attention was now on collecting empirical evidence of how individual cultures change and develop.  Multilinear theory  Cultural particularism dominated popular thought for the first half of the 20th century before American anthropologists, including Leslie A. White, Julian H. Steward, Marshall D. Sahlins, and Elman R. Service, revived the debate on cultural evolution. These theorists were the first to introduce the idea of multilinear cultural evolution. Under multilinear theory, there are no fixed stages (as in unilinear theory) towards cultural development. Instead, there are several stages of differing lengths and forms. Although, individual cultures develop differently and cultural evolution occurs differently, multilinear theory acknowledges that cultures and societies do tend to develop and move forward. Leslie A. White focused on the idea that different cultures had differing amounts of 'energy', White argued that with greater energy societies could possess greater levels of social differentiation. He rejected separation of modern societies from primitive societies. In contrast, Steward argued, much like Darwin's theory of evolution, that culture adapts to its surroundings. 'Evolution and Culture' by Sahlins and Service is an attempt to condense the views of White and Steward into a universal theory of multilinear evolution. =Memetics= Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene proposed the concept of the \\"meme\\", which is analogous to that of the gene. A meme is an idea-replicator that can reproduce itself, by jumping from mind to mind via the process of one human learning from another via imitation. Along with the \\"virus of the mind\\" image, the meme might be thought of as a \\"unit of culture\\" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.), which spreads among the individuals of a population. The variation and selection in the copying process enables Darwinian evolution among memeplexes and therefore is a candidate for a mechanism of cultural evolution. As memes are \\"selfish\\" in that they are \\"interested\\" only in their own success, they could well be in conflict with their biological host's genetic interests. Consequently, a \\"meme's eye\\" view might account for certain evolved cultural traits, such as suicide terrorism, that are successful at spreading meme of martyrdom, but fatal to their hosts and often other people. =Evolutionary epistemology= \\"Evolutionary epistemology\\" can also refer to a theory that applies the concepts of biological evolution to the growth of human knowledge and argues that units of knowledge themselves, particularly scientific theories, evolve according to selection. In that case, a theory, like the germ theory of disease, becomes more or less credible according to changes in the body of knowledge surrounding it. Evolutionary epistemology is a naturalistic approach to epistemology, which emphasizes the importance of natural selection in two primary roles. In the first role, selection is the generator and maintainer of the reliability of our senses and cognitive mechanisms, as well as the \\"fit\\" between those mechanisms and the world. In the second role, trial and error learning and the evolution of scientific theories are construed as selection processes. One of the hallmarks of evolutionary epistemology is the notion that empirical testing alone does not justify the pragmatic value of scientific theories but rather that social and methodological processes select those theories with the closest \\"fit\\" to a given problem. The mere fact that a theory has survived the most rigorous empirical tests available does not, in the calculus of probability, predict its ability to survive future testing. Karl Popper used Newtonian physics as an example of a body of theories so thoroughly confirmed by testing as to be considered unassailable but were nevertheless overturned by Albert Einstein's bold insights into the nature of space-time. For the evolutionary epistemologist, all theories are true only provisionally, regardless of the degree of empirical testing they have survived. Popper is considered by many to have given evolutionary epistemology its first comprehensive treatment, bur Donald T. Campbell had coined the phrase in 1974.(Schilpp, 1974)Schilpp, P. A., ed. The Philosophy of Karl R. Popper. LaSalle, IL. Open Court. 1974. See Campbell's essay, \\"Evolutionary Epistemology\\" on pp. 412–463. = Dual inheritance theory = Taken from the main page: Dual inheritance theory (DIT), also known as gene–culture coevolution or biocultural evolution, was developed in the 1960s through early 1980s to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution. Genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop, changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection, and vice versa. One of the theory's central claims is that culture evolves partly through a Darwinian selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often describe by analogy to genetic evolution.\\"  Criticism and controversy  As a relatively new and growing scientific field, cultural evolution is undergoing much formative debate. Some of the prominent conversations are revolving around Universal Darwinism,Cziko, Gary (1995) Without Miracles: Universal Selection Theory and the Second Darwinian Revolution (MIT Press) dual inheritance theory,E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998. and memetics.Dawkins, Richard (1989). The Selfish Gene (2nd ed.). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. .Blackmore, Susan (1999) The Meme Machine (1st ed.). Oxford University Press. .Dennett, Daniel C. (2005), Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Touchstone Press, New York. pp. 352–360. More recently, cultural evolution has drawn conversations from multi-disciplinary sources with movement towards a unified view between the natural and social sciences. There remains some accusation of biological reductionism, as opposed to cultural naturalism, and scientific efforts are often mistakenly associated with Social Darwinism. However, some useful parallels between biological and social evolution still appear to be found. = Criticism of historic approaches to cultural evolution = Cultural evolution has been criticized over the past two centuries that it has advanced its development into the form it holds today. Morgan's theory of evolution implies that all cultures follow the same basic pattern. Human culture is not linear, different cultures develop in different directions and at differing paces, and it is not satisfactory or productive to assume cultures develop in the same way. A further key critique of cultural evolutionism is what is known as \\"armchair anthropology\\". The name results from the fact that many of the anthropologists advancing theories had not seen first hand the cultures they were studying. The research and data collected was carried out by explorers and missionaries as opposed to the anthropologists themselves. Edward Tylor was the epitome of that and did very little of his own research. Cultural evolution is also criticized for being ethnocentric; cultures are still seen as attempting to emulate western civilization. Under ethnocentricity, primitive societies are said to not yet be at the cultural levels of other Western societies. Much of the criticism aimed at cultural evolution is focused on the unilinear approach to social change. Broadly speaking in the second half of the 20th century the criticisms of cultural evolution have been answered by the multilinear theory. Ethnocentricity, for example, is more prevalent under the unilinear theory. Some recent approaches, such as dual inheritance theory, make use of empirical methods including psychological and animal studies, field site research, and computational models.

Rober (born 1980 or 1981) is an American YouTuber, engineer and inventor. He is known for his YouTube videos on popular science, do-it- yourself gadgets and creative ideas. Several of his videos have gone viral, including one where he made a digital Halloween costume and one where a trap for package thieves that releases a fountain of ultra-fine glitter was constructed. Before YouTube, Rober was an engineer with NASA where he spent seven years working on the Curiosity rover at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He later worked for four years at Apple Inc. as a product designer in their Special Projects Group, where he authored patents involving virtual reality in self-driving cars. In October 2019, Rober was integral in launching the environmental fundraiser #teamtrees, alongside YouTuber MrBeast. Early life Rober grew up in Orange County, California. As a kid, he began tinkering with engineering, including making a pair of goggles that helped avoid tears while cutting onions. He earned a mechanical engineering degree from Brigham Young University and a master's degree from the University of Southern California.  Career  =Early career (NASA)= Rober joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2004. He worked there for nine years, seven of which were spent working on the Curiosity rover, which is now on Mars. He designed and delivered hardware on several JPL missions, including AMT, GRAIL, SMAP, and Mars Science Laboratory. While at NASA, Rober was one of the primary architects for \\"JPL Wired\\", which was a comprehensive knowledge capture wiki. He published a case study about applying wiki technology in a high-tech organization to develop an \\"Intrapedia\\" for the capture of corporate knowledge. =YouTube channel, science communication = During his time at NASA, Rober began making viral videos. His videos cover a wide variety of topics, sparking ideas for April Fools' Day pranks and teaching about tricks like beating an escape room and filming primates in zoos non-invasively. He advocates for science, making videos testing the ability for sharks to smell blood in water, fluidized sand and water purification. In 2011, Rober recorded his first YouTube video involving a Halloween costume, involving two iPads which created the illusion of seeing through his body. He posted the video of the \\"gaping hole in torso\\" costume on YouTube and it went viral, receiving 1.5 million views in just one day. The following year, Rober launched Digital Dudz, an online Halloween costume company which specializes in Halloween costumes based on the same concept as the video (to which Rober holds the patent). The company earned a quarter million dollars in revenue in its first three weeks of operations, and by 2013 his app-integrated costumes were sold in retail stores such as Party City. The costumes were widely featured on news channels such as CBS News, CNN, The Jay Leno Show, Fox, Yahoo! News, Discovery Channel, The Today Show and GMA, and in 2013 Rober sold the company to UK- based costume company Morphsuits. In December 2018, Rober went viral with a video tricking parcel thieves with an engineered contraption that sprayed glitter on the thieves, receiving 25 million views in just one day. The contraption engineered by Rober would explode glitter, emit a foul odor, and record the thieves during the process. Rober later removed two of the five incidents caught on tape, unaware that two of the thieves were actually friends of a person he hired to help catch the package thieves. Rober posted a follow-up to this video in December 2019, teaming up with Macaulay Culkin and featuring an improved design. In addition to YouTube, Rober has contributed articles to Men's Health, and gave a TEDx presentation in 2015 How to Come Up with Good Ideas and another one entitled The Super Mario Effect - Tricking Your Brain into Learning More. He has also made numerous appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In 2018, it was reported that Rober had been secretly working on virtual reality projects for Apple Inc., including the company's on-board entertainment for self-driving cars, for which Rober authored two virtual reality-related patents. Rober had been working for Apple since 2015, spending four years as a product designer in the special projects group, however had left his position by the beginning of 2020. In 2020, Rober will star in a Discovery Channel hidden-camera show alongside Jimmy Kimmel. In October 2019, the YouTube community released a project labeled #TeamTrees in October 2019, organized by MrBeast and Rober following a tweet that suggested that MrBeast should plant 20 million trees. MrBeast and Rober partnered with YouTubers across the globe in an effort to make this come true. The goal of this project was to raise $20,000,000 for the Arbor Day Foundation by 2020, and in exchange, the Arbor Day Foundation would plant one tree for each dollar raised. Notable YouTubers who took part in the project were iJustine, the Slow Mo Guys, Marques Brownlee, Hannah Stocking, PewDiePie, The Try Guys, AsapScience, Smarter Every Day, How Ridiculous, Half as Interesting, Life Noggin, It's Okay to be Smart, and HowToBasic. Personal life Rober moved to the city of Sunnyvale, California in 2015, where he lives with his wife and son. In order to raise awareness about autism, Rober tweeted out his support for those with autism, referencing his son who has the condition. In August 2020, during a video filming sharks in the Bahamas, Rober revealed that he tested positive for COVID-19, delaying production of his video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vePc5V4h_kg References External links * Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American inventors Category:American mechanical engineers Category:American YouTubers Category:Apple Inc. employees Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Charity fundraisers (people) Category:DIY YouTubers Category:Male YouTubers Category:NASA people Category:Online edutainment Category:People from Orange County, California Category:Science communicators Category:University of Southern California alumni Category:Education-related YouTube channels ","title":"Mark Rober"},{"id":"50482525","title":"Clausura 2016 Liga MX championship stage"},{"id":"50482538","text":"The Harry Merrill House, also known as the Harrington–Merrill House, is a historic house in Hutchinson, Minnesota, United States. The house is the oldest wood-framed structure in Hutchinson and one of the oldest in McLeod County. It was built in 1858 by Lewis Harrington, then occupied 1886 to 1932 by Harry Merrill, who served as superintendent of local schools for 33 years. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012 for having local significance in the theme of education. It was nominated for its association with Harry Merrill, arguably the single most important educator in Hutchinson's history. Lewis Harrington The Merrill House was completed in 1858 by one of Hutchinson's founders, Lewis Harrington. Harrington came to Minnesota in 1855, where he met the Hutchinson brothers John, Asa, and Judson. Along with other investors, they formed the Hutchinson Company. The company selected the town site of Hutchinson in November 1855. Harrington played a central role in the new town. He surveyed and built roads, and was the city's first postmaster. He married Ellen Pendergast in 1857. With a child on the way, the couple decided to build a new home. The new house was built in what was called \\"the grove\\". The house was two stories, built in the Greek Revival style. Key architectural elements were a front gabled entrance and a one- story, shed-roof entry porch. During the Dakota War of 1862 the town was attacked by Dakota Indians. Hutchinson residents erected a stockade around the center of town and chose Lewis Harrington as their captain. His house was located outside the stockade. Many structures were burned to the ground, but the Harringtons' home survived. Harrington continued to work as a surveyor and an engineer, and later served in the state legislature. He died in 1884. Harry Merrill Harry Merrill came to Hutchinson in 1882 to serve as school superintendent. He married Lewis Harrington's daughter Martha in 1886. The couple moved into the house with Martha's mother, Ellen. The building was altered to reflect the new architectural fashions. A two-story bay window and one-story box bay window were added on the south elevation. A one-story summer kitchen wing was added to the west side of the house as well. Various other alterations also occurred in the years between 1890 and 1915, including the addition of a screened pavilion on the south and a bedroom on the north. On the spacious grounds, trees and a garden were planted. The Merrills used the home for school functions, and often took in students who worked for room and board. Merrill had a substantial impact on his adopted hometown, holding the post of superintendent for 33 years. In a farm-oriented community, his most important task might have been to get students to attend. He oversaw the implementation of several laws regarding state education. In 1909, when the state authorized vocational education, Merrill began agriculture, manual training, and domestic classes in Hutchinson. Beginning in 1912 Merrill initiated a normal school in association with the high school. It was the only such school in McLeod County, and for more than two decades many of its graduates staffed rural schools in the surrounding area. A measure of Merrill's influence on education is seen in the respect that he earned within the profession, evidenced by his time as president of the Minnesota Education Association in 1914–1915. Merrill was also a civic leader in Hutchinson. He held the post of city councilor and sat on the city's first library board. He was president of the city's Electric Light Company and commercial club. In addition to teaching, Merrill enjoyed farming and planted an apple orchard near his home. He died in 1932 and was followed by his wife Martha in 1935. Later history The next owner of the house was the Merrills' son Lewis, who was a civil engineer. He served as Hutchinson city engineer and McLeod County surveyor. Lewis Merrill brought new tastes to the house after World War I. The bays lost their Victorian detailing and the two-story bay became a one-story entry. The summer kitchen was removed and the porch portion of the kitchen wing was again altered and a second dormer window added. After Lewis's death in 1970, the house fell into disrepair. In 2002 a fire destroyed the kitchen wing and severely damaged the interior of the rest of the house. The property was acquired by the city of Hutchinson late in 2003. The city's park system managed the building, and a local committee began supervising its upkeep and interpretation.

Kornbluth and Judith Merril, published under their pseudonym Cyril Judd. It was originally a three-part serial in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1951 under the title \\"Mars Child\\" and was first published under the title Outpost Mars in 1952 by Abelard Press, New York.Outpost Mars at WorldCat It was reprinted as Sin in Space in 1961.Sin in Space at WorldCat Plot summary The story is based on the growth of a fictional Mars settlement. After 40 years of settlement, Mars has developed into a thriving mining and farming colony, trading four times a year with Earth via rocket. The people of Sun Lake are trying to establish themselves as a self-sufficient community, contrasted with nearby industrial establishments like the Brenner Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Now a legal crisis with Brenner Pharmaceuticals threatens to destroy all the colony's hard work. A small fortune's worth of a drug deadlier than heroin, called Marcaine, has been stolen from a factory near the colony, and Hugo Brenner, the notorious drug dealer and manufacturer, has come to the colony to accuse the council of harboring a drug thief and smuggler. The clock ticks with less than a week until the next rocket shipment goes out; the council goes into a mad search to find a culprit or the missing drugs as they face being shut down and starved out. The book follows the daily routine of the colony's doctor, Tony Hellman: handling several medical problems throughout the colony, delivering a baby, administering checkups, as well as tending to regular patients. By looking into the suspicious murder of a nearby pregnant woman and health complications with the newborn, Sunny, Tony continues to unravel the mystery of the stolen Marcaine. Even after the packing areas and labs are scoured, the drugs are still missing. Eight new passengers fly over from Marsport to the colony, one of them being a famous writer Douglas Graham. Small child-sized footprints turn up in the desert and the story grabs Graham's interest. Graham, Hellman and his assistant Anna make a series of spectacular discoveries that lead to the unearthing of a secret mutant dwarf species of Mars that has been eating the stolen Marcaine as its natural food source.

The videos are accompanied by additional marketing materials, such as in-universe web articles and social media posts. The series has been received positively, seen as better than average viral marketing campaigns, and as a fun and insightful expansion of the MCU for fans of the franchise. Videos =Ant-Man campaign (2015)= =Captain America: Civil War campaign (2016)= Cast and characters * Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart: The WHIH Newsfront presenter. Bibb reprises her role from the Iron Man films. * Al Madrigal as Will Adams: WHIH Newsfronts political correspondent. Also reprising his role from the films is William Sadler as President of the United States, Matthew Ellis, while Paul Rudd and Corey Stoll as Scott Lang and Darren Cross, respectively, appear before their appearances in Ant-Man. Additionally, WIRED Insider presenter James Rondell appears as himself, and a WHIH reporter based on the character Jackson Norris briefly appears; the latter is a separate character from the similarly named Jackson Norriss, who appears in the Marvel One-Shot short film All Hail the King portrayed by Scoot McNairy. Production In June 2015, Leslie Bibb revealed that she was involved in a new project for Marvel Studios, reprising her role of Christine Everhart from Iron Man and Iron Man 2. The next week, the project was revealed to be part of a viral marketing campaign for the Marvel film Ant-Man with the reveal of a faux news program, WHIH Newsfront with Christine Everhart, an extension of the fictional television network WHIH World News which is depicted reporting on major events in many MCU films and television series. Bibb returned as Everhart, and was joined by Al Madrigal as WHIH political correspondent Will Adams, for a WHIH Newsfront Special Report as part of a similar campaign in April 2016 in the lead up to the film Captain America: Civil War. The report focuses on the opposing sides of Civil Wars central conflict, with Everhart supporting governmental oversight and accountability for superheroes, and Adams willing to let the Avengers do what is necessary to save the world. The opinion of the MCU public is also depicted as divided between the two sides. Marvel partnered with Google to produce the videos, which deal with the aftermath of Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the buildup to Ant-Man and Captain America: Civil War, while featuring numerous easter eggs to the MCU, including a news ticker that mentions MCU characters and events such as Jane Foster, the death of Wolfgang von Strucker, and Dr. Stephen Strange. In addition to archive footage from the films, the videos also use original material and \\"footage showing what these fights and their aftermaths look [like] from the civilian perspective\\". Release The videos are made available on the WHIH World News' YouTube channel, with some of them debuting in publications such as Mashable, BuzzFeed, and WIRED Insider. The Ant-Man campaign videos also appear as bonus features on that film's Blu-ray release. =Supplementary material= Other content released for the viral marketing campaigns include ongoing posts on social media sites such as Twitter and Google+, as well as a full length piece on Mashable, attributed to Everhart, that serves as a companion to the videos. More focus was placed on social media for the 2016 return, with tweets released to celebrate Earth Day, with reference to Stark Industries and Pepper Potts, and to mark the end of the clean up of Washington, D.C. following the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, with quotes from MCU politicians such as President Ellis used. Reception Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire called the campaign, \\"one of the cannier bits of marketing that Marvel have come up with\\", saying that \\"it’s not particularly funny, but fans will definitely enjoy it.\\" CinemaBlend's Adam Holmes noted how the videos were able to give insight the rest of the MCU and its population's perception of the films' events. Matthew Mueller at ComicBook.com said, \\"As far as viral marketing goes, this is definitely one of the more well-produced campaigns,\\" and noted, \\"In our 24-hour news cycle, the smallest abnormal occurrence can spawn countless hours of coverage....so it stands to reason that multiple superhero related catastrophes would also warrant that kind of coverage.\\" Alanna Smith, writing for Geek Chic Elite, stated, \\"When I found out about this channel I couldn’t help but laugh out of disbelief and awe towards the Marvel team. I mean come on, real online broadcasts of the news channel that it turns out has been there from the start, and it’s hosted by the same side character (whom we probably didn’t even think would be back) from the startup MCU film made 7 years ago? When Marvel says \\"It’s All Connected\\" they don’t mess around; they really mean .\\" Sean K. Cureton of Screen Rant found the videos to be \\"in keeping with the willingness on the part of Marvel Studios to poke fun at some of the more vocal complaints frequently raised against the action-centric nature of the MCU, and the entire superhero film genre by default. At the same time, in incorporating the real world dialogue regarding the ridiculous levels of structural damage inflicted on various metropolitan settings, [the franchise] sets itself apart through a coy flirtation in engaging the discussion.\\" References Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe mass media Category:2015 web series debuts Category:2016 web series endings Category:Viral marketing Category:Fictional television shows ","title":"WHIH Newsfront"},{"id":"50482779","text":"Kirkwood is an unincorporated community in Nicholas County, in the U.S. state of West Virginia.

Known for their loud and energetic live shows, the band have released four studio albums, two live albums, and a series of EPs and singles. In 2016 The Rumjacks relocated to various parts of Europe where they currently live and tour. One of the band's best-known songs, 'An Irish Pub Song' became a viral hit, generating in excess of 60 million views on YouTube. History Formed in 2008 The Rumjacks combine a variety of musical influences, including elements of punk rock and traditional celtic folk. The band quickly released their debut EP Hung, Drawn & Portered, which was followed by their second EP 'Sound as a Pound' later that year. The Rumjacks quickly developed a strong local following through their constant touring and energetic performances, becoming a must-see group of the Sydney and Australian music scene. With their strong local support and burgeoning international awareness, The Rumjacks secured international supports with punk legends U.K Subs, GBH and Gypsy punk legends Gogol Bordello amongst others. After some early lineup changes, the band settled on and maintained their line up of McLaughlin, McKelvey, drummer Anthony Matters, guitarist Gabriel Whitbourne and banjo/mandolin/bouzouki player Adam Kenny, recording three critically acclaimed albums together: Gangs of New Holland (2010); Sober and Godless (2015); and Sleeping Rough (2016), before Anthony's departure following their 2016 European tour. In addition to performing shows in many Australian cities, The Rumjacks have embarked upon many sold-out European tours. The first European tour in 2015 featured the legendary Jarocin Festival in Poland and the enigmatic Boomtown Fair UK. Quickly followed by their mammoth 2016 Euro tour, that saw The Rumjacks perform on the main stages of festivals including Woodstock Poland; Mighty Sounds; Punk Rock Holiday; and Lowlands Festival. The Rumjacks embarked on their first-ever U.S. tour in March 2017, which included performances at San Diego's Shamrocked Fest and Austin's South by Southwest Music Festival. The band continued to tour across Europe through 2019. 'An Irish Pub Song' A major international breakthrough for the band came with their 2011 single, ‘An Irish Pub Song’ which was lifted from the 2010 album 'Gangs of New Holland'. The song is an observational commentary on the fact that there are Irish styled pubs in every single part of the world. The song's music video exploded on-line, amassing over 60 million views and counting on YouTube, and is the catalyst to the groups growing success and popularity in Europe and the United States. In both 2017 and 2018, YouTube announced its most popular songs on St. Patrick's Day (17 March). 'An Irish Pub Song' was listed as #3 in the USA ahead of songs by Dropkick Murphys, House of Pain, The Corrs, and many more other global giants of music. Anthony Matters Anthony Matters joined The Rumjacks as their full-time drummer in 2009, and worked with the band up until the end of 2016. The pressures of full-time touring, and playing every single day was difficult physically for his body, and he decided to bow out. Anthony was replaced on drums as a full-time member by Pietro Della Sala. Anthony continued to play music in Sydney, Australia, yet due to untreated health issues he passed away on Friday 7 June 2019. 'Saints Preserve Us'(2018)  In early 2018 the band recorded their fourth studio album Saints Preserve Us over 2 weeks in Milan Italy at Crono Sound Factory. It was the first album to feature new drummer Pietro Della Sala. Paul McKenzie from The Real McKenzies featured on the duet ‘The Foreman O’Rourke’, and Mickey Rickshaw appeared on the song ‘Billy McKinley’. The album includes a version of the Irish classic ‘An poc ar buile’ (The Mad Puck Goat) which is sung in Gaelic. The album was released on 12 October 2018. At the end of 2018 the band toured South-East Asia for the first time, going to Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Collaborations The Rumjacks featured on the song 'Shandon Bells', from The Moorings' 2014 EP Nicky's Detox. The band also featured on The Rumpled's ‘The Ugly Side’, from the 2018 album Ashes & Wishes. In 2019 The Rumjacks recorded their version of 'Christmas in Killarney' for Punk Rock Christmas, Volume 2 released by USA label Cleopatra Records. McLaughlin featured on the song 'True Story', from The Clan's 2016 album All In The Name Of Folk, and also on Maleducazione Alcolica's song ‘Hometown’, from the band's 2019 album Chiacchiere da bar. Live Albums (2019) A huge drawcard for The Rumjacks has been their live performances. The band has performed at major festivals all over the world including Byron Bay Bluesfest; BIGSOUND Australia; Jaracin Festival Poland; Boomtown Fair UK; Montelago Celtic Festival Italy; Exit Festival Serbia; Woodstock Poland; Mighty Sounds Czech Republic; Rock Marathon Hungary; Punk Rock Holiday Slovenia; Open Flair Festival Germany; Taubertal Festival Germany; Lowlands Festival Netherlands, South by Southwest USA; and Street Mode Festival Greece. In 2019 the band released two live albums: Live in London – Acoustic Sessions was recorded in the YouTube Space in Kings Cross, UK. The band recorded 10 songs from across their catalogue in unplugged mode, which were released on 18 April 2019. Live in Athens was recorded on tour in 2018. The band played at the Piraeus 177 Academy in Greece on 3 November 2018, which was one of their biggest ever headline shows to date. The album was released on 15 November 2019. Frankie McLaughlin (2008-2020)  Lead singer Frankie McLaughlin was sentenced for three domestic violence offences in 2012: an assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 2 March 2010; a further assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 18 August 2010; and a common assault committed on 26 September 2010, of which the band addressed publicly through their Facebook page at the time. Due to a belated public backlash The Rumjacks also released another statement in 2016 He was removed from the band in April 2020 due to bad behaviour and acts of violence towards band members and support crew.  Mike Rivkees (Joins in 2020)  In 2020, The Rumjacks presented their new singer Mike Rivkees. Originating from Boston, Massachusetts, Mike is also the singer of Boston band 'Mickey Rickshaw' and has numerous music influences from old school hardcore to traditional celtic music.

The town was located at what is known as the \\"White Orchard\\" archaeological site in the town of Palatine, New York on the north bank of the Mohawk. A previous identification of the town with the \\"Wagner's Hollow\\" site, on Caroga Creek, also in the Town of Palatine, is discredited today. The site occupies . Population has been estimated at between 700 and 900 people. History Tionondogen was first built following the raid of the lieutenant-général of New France, Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy in 1666, which destroyed the major Mohawk towns then located south of the river. A peace treaty with the French forced the Mohawks to accept Jesuit missionaries. Father Jacques Bruyas established their mission of St. Marys' in Tionondogen in 1668. There he wrote grammar, a dictionary, catechism and a prayer-book in the Mohawk language. In 1677 an English visitor, Wentworth Greenhalgh wrote \\"Tionondogue is doubly Stockadoed around, has four Ports four foott wide a piece, contains about thirty houses, is situated on a Hill a Bow shott from the Mohawk river.\\" In 1679 the Jesuits left the Mohawk Valley and took a large number of converts with them to Kahnawake, near Montreal. In 1689 the Mohawks began work on a new castle nearby. The proceedings of the City of Albany read: \\"The Maquase desire by Arnout's letter to assist them with two or three pair of horses and five or six men to ride the heqaviest stockades for their new castle of Tionondoge which they remove an English mile higher up.\\" The Albany government sent three pair of horses and six men \\"to show their good inclination and true friendship they entertained toward their Mohawk brethren.\\" Apparently this work had not been completed by 1693. In 1693, Count Frontenac mounted another expedition against the Mohawks. The French captured and burned Caughnawaga and Canajoharie without a fight, and Tionondogue after a surprise attack that killed about 20 or 30 and took 300 captives. Following this the town was abandoned and the Mohawks moved back to the south bank of the river. Archaeology In the late 1800s amateur archaeologist and collector Adelbert G. Richmond did some digging on the site, but otherwise it was not widely known. Some of the material Richmond collected is in the \\"Richmond/Frey Collection\\" of the Montgomery County Historical Society in Old Fort Johnson at Fort Johnson, New York. Following this there has been some sporadic artifact collection. A team from the University at Albany has walked the site, but as of 1995 no formal excavation had taken place. At that time the site was on private land in a cultivated field.

In addition to its current name, the stream was historically known as Salmon Creek or Little Salmon Creek. The current name was officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1905. Course The Little Salmon River drains an approximately watershed, which is primarily agricultural and residential in nature. The river rises at the confluence of the North Branch Little Salmon River and South Branch Little Salmon River in the eastern part of the town of Mexico, west of the village of Parish. From there, the river flows northwest through the village of Mexico and the hamlet of Texas before emptying into Lake Ontario at Mexico Point. Sportfishing The lower Little Salmon River provides habitat for a variety of resident fish species, including brown bullhead, white suckers, rock bass, largemouth bass, and northern pike. In addition, several lake-dwelling species enter the Little Salmon River during annual spawning runs in the fall, including Chinook salmon, coho salmon, steelhead, and brown trout. In 2015, 3,410 steelhead were stocked in the river by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

It was officially considered an Armenian National division, but in fact was made up of several other nationalities as well. After forming it remained in service in the Caucasus and Iran until the summer of 1942, when it was redeployed to help counter the German drive toward Tuapse. The 408th had a short and undistinguished career as a combat formation, and was soon disbanded.

Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 While the division was formed in Armenia, Armenian nationals were very much in the minority. For nearly the entire first year of its service, the 408th was in 45th Army along the border with Turkey and in the occupation force in Iran. It was commanded by Col. Pavel Nikolaievich Kitzuk throughout its existence; Maj. (later, Lt. Col.) Leonid Kolobov served as chief of staff from September, 1941 to August, 1942.  Combat service  In July, 1942, the German 17th Army began an offensive through the passes of the Caucasus Mountains towards the Soviet ports along the eastern coast of the Black Sea, focusing on Tuapse. Given this threat, the 408th was redeployed in this direction and was split up. While the bulk of the division joined the Tuapse Defense Region, the 672nd Rifle Regiment was detached in September to the 47th Army defending the mountain passes north of the city.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 112 By September 23 the entire division formed this Army's reserve. During the following weeks the German XXXXIX Mountain Corps gradually forced its way southwards, making contact with the partly-isolated and under-supplied 408th on October 14. On the 21st, the German force launched an assault from the Gunaika River valley towards the villages of Goitkh and Georgievskoe. An intense artillery barrage destroyed the division's headquarters near Mount Semashkho, killing and wounding most of its staff. With command and control devastated, the defenses of the 408th, and the adjacent 107th Rifle Brigade, were shattered.

Reception  The Complete Review gave the novel a B, writing that \\"The Future Leaders isn't very well written or presented, but it is a rollicking and often entertaining ride, cheerful Reuben an appealing guide (of sorts), and one does get some sense of Kenya around independence.\\"  References   Further reading  * Future Category:1973 novels Category:African Writers Series ","title":"The Future Leaders"},{"id":"50483238","title":"C8orf82"},{"id":"50483242","text":"XHRVI-FM is a radio station on 106.3 FM in Ixtacomitán, Tabasco.

Henry Lawson has long since earned the right to be heard in both prose and verse; indeed, he is familiar to readers as are many of the verses in this new volume of his; but yet in one way we find a new Lawson, a man who has evidently upon him the spirit of repentance for something done, and a strong desire to make amends. So strong are these evidences, and so directly put, that it is impossible to dissociate them from a personal application.\\"\\"Literature\\", The Queenslander, 16 December 1905, p27 A reviewer in The Age was less than impressed: \\"It is to be feared that even the most ardent of Mr. Lawson's admirers will look upon this book of verse as a disappointment. It represents the results of bis five years' work since he returned from England in 1900 — years that for various reasons must be considered the blackest of his life — and the unevenness of that work is almost painful to contemplate now that we have it in bulk. Only occasionally does he display any gleam — and then only a fleeting one — which bears any promise of better things in the future.\\"\\"New Books\\", The Age, 9 December 1905, p6 External links * Full text of the collection at Setis.When I Was King and Other Verses by Henry Lawson See also * 1905 in Australian literature * 1905 in poetry References Category:Poetry by Henry Lawson Category:Australian poetry collections Category:1905 books Category:Angus & Robertson books ","title":"When I Was King and Other Verses"},{"id":"50483470","text":"The Petit Jean River is a river in west-central Arkansas. The river rises in the Ouachita Mountains in northern Scott County; it flows through Logan County and Yell County, defining the border between Yell County and Conway County before reaching its mouth at the Arkansas River north of Petit Jean State Park. The city of Danville, named after a steamboat that navigated the river in 1840, is the largest settlement on the river. Blue Mountain Lake, which straddles the border between Logan and Yell Counties, was created when the river was dammed in 1947. The river is the longest located entirely within the Arkansas River Valley. According to local legend, the river and the nearby Petit Jean Mountain were both named after a French woman who posed as a man to follow a lover to America. Due to her size, she was nicknamed \\"Petit Jean\\" by her ship's crew. She fell ill and died after reaching Arkansas and was reportedly buried on the side of the mountain. An alternate explanation states that the river was named for the French phrase \\"petit jaune\\", or \\"little yellow\\", due to its appearance. The discharge of the Petit Jean has been measured by the USGS since 1916. The stream gauge near Danville measures flow from an area of . The mean flow between 1947 and 2013 was , with the lowest daily flow recorded as zero in August 1956. The highest river level recorded occurred in April 1939 with a height of through the gauge, giving a corresponding flow of . Two bridges across the river, one in Yell County and one in Logan County, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
