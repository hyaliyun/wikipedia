Kalisch was chosen due to its links with the 1813 Treaty of Kalisch between the two countries, which paved the way for the joint Prussian- Russian pursuit of Napoleon as he retreated from Moscow. It involved both countries' officers practising manoeuvres at army and corps level, though it did not include mock-battles.

It was established in 1875. History During late 19th Century, There was only one High school named Free Church Mission High school in Nellore which was established and maintained by Christian Missionary. According to then District Collector Vans Agnew, Nellore citizens were against educating their children in a Christian missionary school and exposing them to Christian teachings.This is evident from 7 August 1873 note from the previous District Collector Mr. Vans Agnew‚Äôs to D.P.I. [Director Of Public Instruction], which reads as follows ‚Äì \\"I think that Nellore has been placed at un-deserved disadvantage in comparison to other districts in respect of State Education. We ought to have a Government Zilla School at Nellore itself‚Ä¶.Nellore parents do not feel themselves practically forced to send their sons to hear Xian (Sic) prayers daily from a master, who avowed object is to proselytize them, without an acute consciousness of loss of self-respect and a feeling of reproach towards the Government.\\" In 1873, Nellore mandal‚Äôs first graduate, Sunku Narayana Swamy Chetty, joined the missionary school as head master. He resigned from this position in 1875 due to differences with school's principal, Reverend John MacMillan. Chetty's resignation had further catalyzed the Nellore citizens to start a new Hindu School. Later in 1875, Chetty went to Krishnapatnam to meet a collector who was conducting a Jamabandhi camp there. Some district employees convinced Chetty to take the initiative and start a Hindu school. At the next town hall in Nellore, construction of Hindu school and appointment of Chetty as its head master was authorized. = Hindu mission inauguration = On 3 May 1875, Hindu Anglo Vernacular School was inaugurated. Along with Chetty as head master, five other teachers were appointed. The school attracted 152 students in the first year. = Rivalry with FCM School = With Swamy's efforts, the school grew. People called the school B.A. gari paatasala meaning Mr.B.A.‚Äôs school. There wereg hurdles; FCM school officials had developed personal hatred of Swamy and lodged allegations of unfair competition and incompetent staff. An inspector conducted an inquiry and condemned the allegations. Barrow succumbed to the pressure of FCM school's principal Macmillan and called for a town hall to discuss the necessity of second high school. In-charge collector T. Von D. Hardings presided over this town hall, which recommended that there was no need for a second school of higher education in Nellore. After a second collector took over the investigation, the need for second school was justified and a grant was recommended. After further legal maneuvers, the school's grant was stopped. As a last resort, the committee approached Madras Governor Duke of Buckingham and pleaded for his help to no avail. As the financial condition of the school deteriorated, the school started taking donations to close the deficit. Based on the recommendation of Nellore Catholic Priest Rev. C.R. Mitchel, Madras Roman Catholic Bishop agreed to send a donation of Rs. 10/- per month, but the financial troubles continued. Chetty sacrificed his position in 1878 and continued to work persistently for the growth of the school, which resulted in school being recognized in 1879 and receiving government grants from that year. = Acquisition of premises = The school was opened in a rented house near the city's Collector office. Space considerations lead to several location changes until a permanent location was found. On 27 February 1879 Haji Mohammad Rahimtulla, Ex-Diwan of Venkatagiri estate purchased the present V R College premises in a court auction. He donated the facilities to Hindu High School and it was registered in the school's name on 24 November 1879. Rahimutulla continued as a school committee member until his retirement in 1886. = Change of name = The financial condition of the school was not improving. Venkatagiri Raja purchased a Government bond for Rs. 15,000/- with the condition that the school should be named for him. In 1887 the buildings were in a bad state and the government grant was stopped. Raja's help was again requested; he gave a Rs. 5000/- donation and another Rs.5000/- as a loan which was later fully paid. With this money repairs were completed and three new classrooms were constructed. This new block was inaugurated by Madras Governor Lord Connemara on 12 November 1888. The government grant was restarted in 1889, and as an additional financial security to the school, management purchased ten shares in Nellore Permanent Fund in 1900. In 1901, the school received legal status as a registered society under XXI law of 1860. In 1901, Abdul Kareem Khan Saheb had donated a house worth Rs.2000/- to run a branch school. In 1902, Madras Governor Lord Ampthill visited the school and participated in a prize distribution ceremony. On this occasion, the foundation stone was laid for a new block. The room next to the East Hall on the North Side was built by Raja Velugoti Krishna Yachendra Velugoti Dynasty Bahadur (younger brother of Venkatagiri Raja) at a cost of Rs. 11,300/-.  Branch schools  A branch school was started in town in 1889, which was re-merged with the parent school after few years. In 1905, another school in town by the name of Akkaraju Raghavaiah Primary School became a branch school. It was also merged with parent school in October 1908. In May 1908, another branch school was opened in Ranganayakula Pet of Nellore but was closed in 1909 due to financial troubles. Between 1912 and 1928, the Mutharaju Subbaramaiah School in Chinna Bazar Nellore was made a branch school and became popular among locals of that area. As the school's popularity and reputation increased, the number of students increased and classes were conducted in semi-permanent rooms that were constructed on the North side of the play ground.  Building  Construction of the present school building was started in 1950 and by 1964 high school classes were shifted to the new building. Enuga Sundara Rami Reddy had personally supervised the construction of the building from the foundation stage. He completed the entire building except for two rooms prior to his illness and death in 1961. Based on the recommendations of the Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar Committee, a seven-year secondary school education system was introduced in the state. The high school was upgraded to Higher Secondary School in 1960 and classes from grade VI to grade XII were introduced. The first batch of grade XII students passed out from the school in 1961 under the leadership of K.Ramalinga Reddy as Head Master. During his era, an incomplete building on the northeast side of the grounds was completed. There was a gradual improvement in the H.S.L.C exam results and by 1968, it reached 83% - a record in the school's history. An English medium was started in the school, which further attracted students. In 1966-69, the government of Andhra Pradesh had introduced an Integrated Syllabus. In line with this the government proposed converting the high school into a junior college by having five years of secondary education, two years of intermediate and three years of degree education all under the same umbrella. As there was already a first grade college under the control of the same management committee, the proposal was declined. This resulted in the school being downgraded to a secondary school.  Library  The school's library was first established in 1875 by donated books. At present, the library holds more than 10,000 books spread across Telugu, English, Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu languages. There are more than 100 encyclopedias. A reading room attached to the library is frequented by students during their recess periods.

There are a variety of techniques to join aluminum including mechanical fasteners, welding, adhesive bonding, brazing, soldering and friction stir welding (FSW), etc. Various techniques are used based on the cost and strength required for the joint. In addition, process combinations can performed to provide means for difficult to join assemblies and to reduce certain process limitations.  Mechanical fasteners  Example of aluminum aircraft panel A simple and cheap method to join aluminum is using mechanical fasteners (i.e. bolts and nuts). Normally a hole is drilled into the base material and a fastener is placed inside. This type of joiner requires some type of overlapping material for a joint to be made. Aluminum rivets or bolts and nuts can be used; however, high-stress applications would require higher strength fastener material such as steel. This could lead to galvanic corrosion of different materials which have varying electrochemical potential. Significant corrosion would weaken the assembly over time and possibly lead to failure. In addition, different materials could result in thermal fatigue cracking from differing coefficients of thermal expansion. As the assembly is repeatedly heated stresses can build up and enlarge the mounting hole. A commonplace mechanical fasteners are used is riveting of aluminum panels on airplane exteriors.  Adhesive bonding  Aluminum can be joined with a variety of adhesives. Aluminum may require some level of surface preparation and passivation to remove any unwanted chemical from the surface. Passivation could be as simple as rubbing alcohol or ultrasonic cleaning. Before bonding, a dry fit should be conducted to confirm proper fitting of the components. Adhesives may require heat, pressure, or both during curing; however, the adhesive application should be conducted per the adhesive manufacturer's instructions. = Surface preparation = Aluminium oxide nanoparticles prepared by biopolymer mineralization In order for a proper adhesive bond, some surface preparation is necessary. A surface cleaning to remove any impurities is made. The surface of the parts to be joined may be roughened with an abrasive such as sandpaper. This provides interlocking surface asperities and increases surface area for bonding. A chemical treatment may also be needed to increase the surface energy of the adherent and remove the oxide layer. Aluminum oxide is weakly bonded to the underlying aluminum metal and without removal, the adhesive joint is dramatically weakened. Oxides layers can separate from the metal substrate and is a key principle for adhesive failure theory, Bikerman weak boundary layer. One way to strength the oxide layer and prevent oxide to substrate failure is to anodize the material. Anodizing creates a strong hexagonal oxide layer with additional surface area for adhesive joining. = Type of adhesives = Adhesive selection can be dictated based on cost, strength and needed ductility. Hobbyist commonly uses cyanoacrylate (super glue), epoxy, or JB Weld. Silicone may also be used in an application in which waterproofing is needed.  Welding  US Navy 101018-N-6362C-056 Hull Maintenance Technician 3rd Class Christopher Pizzino makes a welding repair to an aluminum boat on the fantail. Most aluminum alloys can be joined by welding together; however, certain aircraft grade aluminum and other special alloys are unweldable using conventional methods. Aluminum is commonly welded with gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Due to aluminum's oxide layer, a positive polarity is needed break up the surface to ensure a proper weld. Alternating current (AC) is also used to allow the benefits of a negative polarity which provides penetration and enough positive polarity for a containment free weld. For more details on welding parameters structural aluminum welding codes can be found in AWS D1.2. Aluminum welding typically creates a softened region in the weld metal and heat affected zone. Additional heat treatments may be needed to obtain an acceptable material for an application. Industrial welding is also commonly found in joining aluminum: friction stir welding, laser welding, and ultrasonic welding are some of the many processes used.  Brazing and soldering  Automobile radiator joined with brazing. Aluminum can be brazed or soldered to almost any material including concrete, ceramics, or wood. Brazing and soldering can be applied manually or through an automated technique. Manual aluminum brazing can be difficult due to no observable color change before melting. Similar to other techniques, aluminum's strong oxide can prevent proper bonding. Strong acids and bases can be used to weaken the oxide or aggressive fluxes may be used. Brazing alloys for aluminum must have a relatively low melting temperature which is below aluminum's melting temperature (660 ¬∞C). In addition, aluminum alloys with high magnesium content can \\"poison\\" fluxes and depress the melting temperature which can result in a weak joint. In some cases, the aluminum parts can be clad with a different material and brazed with a more common technique and filler material. Brazed joints require overlapping of parts. The amount of overlap can greatly affect the strength of the joint.  Friction stir welding  Friction stir welding is a solid-state joining process that uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the workpiece material. Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material, which leads to a softened region near the FSW tool. While the tool is traversed along the joint line, it mechanically intermixes the two pieces of metal, and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure, which is applied by the tool, much like joining clay, or dough. It was primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength.

She was one of the most important women in the (overwhelmingly male) \\"Willy-Fred\\" group around Sepp Plieseis. She was the only woman who knew the way to the so-called \\"Hedgehog\\" (cave-like hut) used by anti-Nazi partisans, to which by the end of the war she had herself made several deliveries of food and/or messages.  Life  = Early years = Marianne Kalss was born in Altaussee, a small spa town in the extreme northwest of Styria, and a short distance to the east of Salzburg. She attended school locally. Her parents both died while she was a child. She married Karl Feldhammer in 1931. Their daughter Anna was born shortly afterwards. Karl Feldhammer was a skilled carpenter and wood worker who faced long periods of unemployment while his two children were young. He was able to fall back on making wooden shoes, for which the salt mines had an ongoing requirement. Through her husband, who till 1934 was a Social Democrat, Marianne Feldhammer became interested in politics. After the events of 1934 she came into contact with local Communist groups in the Salzkammergut region. = After 1938 = Shortly after Austria was annexed into an enlarged Germany her husband Karl Feldhammer, who since 1934 had become a Communist party official, was arrested and placed before the district court at Ischl . He was released after fourteen days. He now began to seek out other opponents of National Socialism in Austria to create a resistance group. Through the Bad Ischl shoe maker Hans Rettenbacher they were put into contact with Resi Pesendorfer, later one of the most important women in the Austrian resistance movement. = Organising a resistance network = A priority at the time was to keep concealed from the authorities people living \\"underground\\", by creating a succession of rapidly changing \\"safe houses\\" and providing food for which, in the context of the rationing, those who were not registered residents would have no coupons. The women engaged in this activity also took care of information exchange between trusted individuals in the Salzkammergut mountain regions, and operated a messaging service linking Aussee, Goisern , Ischl and Ebensee. Marianne Feldhammer was employed, officially, as a washerwoman who washed the laundry of the better off families in a river channel at Altaussee. There was no facility for a washing clothes in a laundry using chemical cleaning materials in the Aussee district, so she had a perfectly good reason to make weekly visits to the river channel in Altaussee, where she could contact Resi Pesendorfer and resistance supporters there without arousing suspicion. = Supplies for the \\"hedgehog\\" hideout = Pressure on the resistance groups increased from about 1943 as ever larger numbers of army deserters sought refuge in the mountains where they hoped to live \\"underground\\" - without a registered domicile, which would make it harder for the authorities to locate them and send them back to the Russian front. It became impossible to find reliable safe houses to accommodate the numbers involved. During the summer months many of the men were able to live out in the open, under the trees, and to sleep in little used or abandoned mountain huts which had been constructed for keeping the hay crop dry until it was needed for the animals. For winter accommodation the communist, Sepp Plieseis, was able to improvise a separate \\"partisan shelter\\" for pacifist comrades, using a large cave-like hut higher up in the mountains, carefully sited so that smoke from fires would not be visible from across the valley. The structure came to be known as the \\"Igel\\" (\\"Hedgehog\\"), out of deference to the family of hedgehogs living on the site when the men started to construct their shelter. Pliesseis had been convicted as a poacher before the war, and was. like many of the local men, able to use his intimate knowledge of the mountains to keep the comrades supplied, although locally available game was not, on its own, a sufficient solution to the challenges arising. The women in the valley organised supplies for the partisans' secretive supporters, concentrating their efforts on food, but also delivering weapons and ammunition. Marianne Feldhammer was one of those who then deposited these supplies at one of a series of predetermined points, for instance on the inaccessible \\"Blaa-Alm\\" mountain. At some stage she became aware of the full route all the way to the \\"Hedgehog\\" hideaway, and on three occasions, when the need was urgent, she herself delivered heavy bundles of supplies right to the partisans' mountain shelter. There were also occasions, if the weather was very bad, when men came down to the valley to collect bread or meat or to hand messages to the women for onward transmission to other resistance groups. Marianne Feldhammer was the conduit through which messages were passed for Resi Pesendorfer and the partisan group in the Ischl region. Like Pesendorfer, Feldhammer was on several occasions summoned by the Gestapo for interrogation sessions. = Death of Karl Feldhammer = Marianne's husband also found himself sought by the Gestapo, and increasingly himself lived \\"underground\\". He was arrested in 1944 but managed to escape. At irregular intervals, however, he took his turn to come down from the mountains to collect supplies and to visit his wife and daughter. On 26 January 1945, during one of these visits, the Gestapo appeared at the front door at five in the morning. Karl Feldhammer jumped out of a window at the back of the house in order to escape through the garden, but a Gestapo man shot and killed him using a submachine gun. While the other policeman concentrated on threatening Marianne Feldhammer with his pistol, the couple's twelve year old daughter, Anna, quietly threw the illegal meat supplies that had been intended for delivery to the partisans out of the window where, thanks to the depth of the snow, they remained undiscovered. The Gestapo failed to obtain direct evidence against Marianne Feldhammer. Sources suggest that the traditionalist assumption - apparently shared by the Gestapo and the resistance partisans in the area - that no woman would ever enjoy significant influence as a resistance activist, served to protect Marianne Feldhammer and her daughter from any more savage level of attention from the authorities. She was accordingly able to ensure, if nothing else, that Karl Feldhammer received a proper funeral. = Remembering = After the war ended Marianne Feldhammer lived quietly with her daughter as a widow in Aussee. For a generation there was little mention of the important role played by resistance activists in liberating Austria from the Nazis. For many years the traditionalist Catholic establishment in Austria downplayed the role of women in the resistance movement. In addition, in the atmosphere of cold war confrontation of the period, there was a widespread reluctance in the west to acknowledge the contribution made by people associated with the communists. It was only in the 1980s, notably through the meticulous work of Peter Kammerst√§tter (who died in 1993) in gathering documents and testimonies of contemporary witnesses, that it became possible for the contribution of activists such as the Feldhammers to be known to the wider public, and to find a way into the mainstream historical record.Peter Kammerst√§tter: Material- Sammlung √ºber die Widerstands- und Partisanenbewegung Willy-Fred im oberen Salzkammergut - Ausseerland 1943-1945. Eigenverlag, Linz 1978. In 1985 the film maker Ruth Beckermann produced a documentary about wartime resistance in the Salzkammergut which included interviews with surviving women who had taken part in anti-Nazi resistance. The 37 minute film appeared under the title \\"Igel\\" (\\"Hedgehog\\"). Parts of it appeared in subsequent television films which were transmitted in Germany and Austria. In 2006 the writer known as Franzobel from V√∂cklabruck published \\"Hirschen\\" (\\"Deer\\"), a stage work on the same theme, which featured Marianne Feldhammer. Marianne Grab died in 1996.

Sukmawati is the younger sister of former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri and politician Rachmawati Sukarnoputri. Education Sukmawati attended elementary and junior high school at Sekolah Rakyat Cikini in Jakarta, graduating in 1967. In 1969, she graduated from State Senior High School 3 Teladan. She attended the Dance Academy of the Jakarta Arts Education Institute (LPKJ) from 1970-1974. In 2003, she enrolled in international relations at Jakarta‚Äôs Bung Karno University. Political career In 1998, following the fall of Suharto, she revived the Indonesian National Party (PNI), which was renamed PNI Supeni and competed in Indonesia‚Äôs 1999 general election, winning only 0.36% of the vote. Being ineligible to contest future elections because of its poor performance, the party changed its name to PNI Marhaenisme in 2002 and Sukmawati was appointed chairwoman. The party received 0.81% of votes in the 2004 general election, winning just one seat in parliament. In the 2009 election, the party won just 0.3% and lost its only seat. =High school diploma case= The Election Supervisory Board (Bawaslu) reported Sukmawati to the National Police in July 2009, alleging she had falsified her high school diploma when registering as a legislative candidate for the Marhaenism Indonesian National Party. Police in August dropped the case, saying there was a lack of evidence as the school's records had been destroyed by a fire in 2007. =Memoir= In 2011, Sukmawati wrote a memoir about the 15 years she lived at the Merdeka Palace, called Creeping Coup d'Etat Mayjen Suharto (The Creeping Coup d‚ÄôEtat of Major General Suharto). She believes Suharto and other members of the military conducted a coup against Sukarno by using the Order of March 11, 1966. She said she cannot forgive Suharto for human rights violations that occurred in the aftermath of the coup. Complaint against Rizieq Shihab In October 2016, Sukmawati filed a police complaint against radical Muslim cleric Rizieq Shihab, accusing him of insulting Sukarno and Indonesian state ideology Pancasila. Rizieq had allegedly made a speech stating ‚Äúin Sukarno's Pancasila, God is placed in the ass, whereas according to the Jakarta Charter, God is in the head‚Äù. The Jakarta Charter was a proposed preamble to Indonesia‚Äôs 1945 Constitution that would have required Muslims to follow Shariah law. Police declared Rizieq a suspect in January 2017. He fled Indonesia in May 2017 when also named a suspect in a pornography case. Personal life Sukmawati was married to Prince Sujiwa Kusuma (Mangkunegara IX) of the Mangkenegara royal family of Solo, Central Java. They had three children, and later divorced. Controversial poem On 28 March 2018, Sukmawati recited a poem deemed offensive and blasphemous by some Muslims. Amron Ansyhari of Hanura Party and lawyer Denny Andrian Kusdayat on 3 April reported Sukmawati to Jakarta Police for alleged blasphemy. Her poem, Ibu Indonesia (Mother Indonesia) was a celebration of Indonesian fashion and tradition, which she compared to imported Islamic fashion and tradition. Denny, who had in 2012 been jailed for extortion, claimed Sukmawati had belittled God by saying Mother Indonesia's ballad was more soothing than the Islamic call to prayer. On 4 April, Sukmawati apologized to all Indonesian Muslims, saying she was especially sorry to those who felt offended by the poem. On the same day, another two organizations, the Indonesian Ulema Defense Team (TPUI) and the Indonesian Islamic Student Movement (GMII), reported Sukmawati to police, claiming her poem was an insult. On 6 April, Indonesian Muslims, including children, protested in Jakarta, demanding Sukmawati be jailed. They said she should not be forgiven for the poem, whereas the Indonesian Ulemas Association and several politicians had called for forgiveness.

She was the granddaughter of Oliver Ames Jr. (President of the Union Pacific Railroad 1868-1871) and great granddaughter of Oliver Ames Sr. who founded the Ames Shovel Works in 1803.Chaplin 2004, p.441  Political Career and Marriage  In 1905, she was a member of the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage and became President.Varella 1978, p.1 This was in direct conflict with her cousin-in-law Blanche Ames, President of the Easton Woman Suffrage League and Treasurer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage League. The two family members maintained a very genial relationship regardless, agreeing to disagree. For example, when the 19th Amendment passed in 1920, Blanche would often consult with Mary on whom to vote for in the coming elections. On May 8, 1916, she married Louis A. Frothingham (March 4, 1871 - August 23, 1928) at Unity Church in Easton, Massachusetts.Varella 1978, p.1 Born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Frothingham served as Major in the United States Army during World War 1. He graduated from Harvard Law in 1896, was Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and 41st Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts (1909-1912). In 1918, Mr. Frothingham was sent to France by Governor Samuel W. McCall. While stationed in Paris, Mr. and Mrs. Frothingham opened their home to soldiers on leave and even attended to troops at the front line in the trenches. When Mr. Frothingham was running for Massachusetts 14th Congressional district in 1920, Mary served as Chairperson of the Woman‚Äôs Republican Town Committee in Easton.Varella 1978, p.3  Community Involvement  Mary Frothingham rose garden Having met Clara Barton as a young woman and establishing a longtime friendship, Mary involved herself with the Red Cross. She established the Easton branch and was President from World War I through World War II. Frothingham Hall, dedicated to her husband, served the efforts of the Red Cross through all day knitting and sewing sessions. Volunteers made coats, sweaters, pajamas and repaired bandages.Varella 1978, p.8-9 She was first President of the American Legion Auxiliary of Easton in 1920 and maintained an interest in the support of veterans and peace groups throughout her life.Varella 1978, p.3 Her devotion to the Unity Church of Easton, Massachusetts was noteworthy. Along with her mother and siblings Oliver, Frederick, John and Helen, she gave the oak screen and pulpit at the front of the church and also the Charles Jay Connick stained glass window above the main entrance. The oak carving is that of artist Johannes Kirchmayer and designed by Boston architect Henry Vaughan. She was Trustee of the Village Cemetery, located behind the church, from 1900 to 1954.Varella 1978, p.8 The Ames Free Library in North Easton, MA benefited greatly from Mary‚Äôs involvement and care. Beginning in 1900, she frequented the library often and would update any technology to suit modern day needs. For example, she introduced and paid for the first new typewriter and card catalog. She served as President of the Library from 1929 to 1955. Her portrait is hanging in the library to this day.Varella 1978, p.8 During World War I, she gave each child in town, grades 4 through 12, a thrift card and stamp to foster as interest in patriotism during wartime. She hosted a Christmas party each year for the grammar school students in Easton and provided a gift for each one. The event was held every Christmas for forty years and was reduced to only serving North Easton Grammar School kindergarten after her death. It was eventually phased out as the population and number of schools increased. She installed lockers and showers in the Anna C. Ames Gymnasium, assumed mortgages on homes in Easton that were considered a great risk and paid for the cost of dormitory life at Bridgewater State University for the daughter of her estate superintendent.Ames E. 2011, p.43Varella 1978, p.7 Her affection for gardens and public parks was evident in her charitable contributions and causes she supported. The garden at her home was large and well-kept. She commissioned landscape architect Herbert J. Kellaway to design the layout. Harriett Risley Foote, celebrated rosarian, selected the roses and supervised their planting. In 1924, the American Rose Society honored her rose garden with a visit during their annual meeting. In addition, she encouraged a home garden program for local school children. She donated to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston and she was one of the few patrons allowed to drive through the park. Frothingham Park, a memorial to her husband‚Äôs baseball career as Captain at Harvard, was dedicated on September 27, 1930. The YMCA and Oliver Ames High School utilized the park for sporting events until the 1980s. There stands a playground for young children, a baseball field surrounded by a track and tennis courts.Ames D. 2017, p.72-79Boston Transcript 1924, p.3Varella 1978, p.4-5 Wayside Mary's home, Wayside (Easton town offices) Her Georgian Revival style mansion known as ‚ÄôWayside‚Äô was built in 1912. Designed by Boston architect Guy Lowell, Wayside now serves as the Easton town offices.Varella 1978, p.1  Personal Following the sudden death of her husband, G.O.P. leaders requested that Mary become a candidate to the 14th district office of representative in Congress.

In it, it is mentioned the following: That as it has always been a source of serious regret with me, to see the youth of these United States sent to foreign Countries for the purpose of Education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own; contracting, too frequently, not only habits of dissipation & extravagence, but principles unfriendly to Republican Government and to the true & genuine liberties of Mankind; which, thereafter are rarely overcome. [...] I give and bequeath in perpetuity the fifty shares which I hold in the Potomac Company (under the aforesaid Acts of the Legislature of Virginia) towards the endowment of a UNIVERSITY to be established within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the General Government, if that government should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it; and until such Seminary is established, and the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my further Will & desire is that the profit accruing therefrom shall, whenever the dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing Stock in the Bank of Columbia, or some other Bank, at the discretion of my Executors; or by the Treasurer of the United States for the time being under the direction of Congress; provided that Honourable body should Patronize the measure, and the Dividends proceeding from the purchase of such Stock is to be vested in more stock, and so on, until a sum adequate to the accomplishment of the object is obtained, of which I have not the smallest doubt, before many years passes away; even if no aid or encouraged is given by Legislative authority, or from any other source.George Washington‚Äôs Last Will and Testament ‚Äì Mount Vernon ‚Äì 9 July 1799 ‚Äì https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-04-02-0404-0001 =Proclamation= Since about 1895, there had been a movement to build a National University dedicated to the first President of the United States, George Washington as the centennial of his death was approaching.A University their Aim: Executive Committee of Washington Memorial Association Meets ‚Äì The Washington Post ‚Äì December 14, 1897 ‚Äì page 7Report of the George Washington Memorial Association, June 1899, https://archive.org/details/reportofgeorgewa00geor p. 4.

It later became the George Washington Memorial Association (GWMA). Its purpose was: To promote a patriotic interest in the bequest made by the \\" Father of his Country \\" for the establishment of a National University, to be known as the University of the United States, for the higher learning, ‚Äîan exclusively post graduate university,‚Äîthat shall complete the American system of public education and lead in research and investigation. The committee proposes to raise in small contributions the sum of $250,000 for the erection of a building for educational purposes, the corner-stone of which shall be laid on or near the one hundredth anniversary of his bequest in this behalf. It was organized as a national Executive Board aided by Executive Committees in each State and Territory. It was composed originally mainly of patriotic women from all over the United States. However, it was soon gaining support from other groups and became mixed. Sponsorship efforts On December 14, 1897, the Executive Committee gathered at the Hotel Raleigh in Washington, D.C., for their first annual meeting to discuss the Memorial University Project. It was attended by several hundreds of people and several speakers were presenting for the duration of the meeting which lasted until December 17, 1897.Their Session has Ended: Washington Memorial Association Concludes ‚Äì The Washington Post ‚Äì December 17, 1897 ‚Äì p. 2 During the four-day meeting, it was called for February 22, 1898 to be an Offering Day to the memory of George Washington to reach the $250,000 goal set then to build a National University. It was hoped that a cornerstone of an administration building could be laid by December 14, 1899, the hundredth anniversary of Washington's death. However, this would not happen until 1921. By 1915, the Executive Committee had Mrs. Susan Dimock as president of the Association. Under her leadership, the Association had been able to get the support of Former President William H.

She succeeded Hubert Lacroix for the position in 2018 and is the first woman to head the organization. Tait is also the chair of the Global Task Force for Public Media, an initiative of the Public Media Alliance launched in September 2019.  Education  Catherine Tait holds a Bachelor of Arts in Literature and Philosophy degree from the University of Toronto, a Master of Science from Boston University, and a Dipl√¥me d‚Äô√âtudes Approfondies in Communications Theory from the Paris-Sorbonne University.  Career  = Media and culture industry = Prior to joining CBC/Radio-Canada, Catherine Tait had worked in film and television production in Canada and the U.S. for more than three decades. She served as Manager of Policy and Planning at Telefilm Canada in the 1980s, before going on to become Director and Cultural Attach√© with the Canadian Cultural Centre in France from 1989 to 1991. In Canada, Tait was President and COO of Salter Street Films from 1997 to 2001, producing such shows as the long-running CBC comedy This Hour Has 22 Minutes. In 2002, she and film producer Liz Manne co-founded New York‚Äìbased Duopoly Inc., an independent film, television and digital content company. Tait served as President until 2018. She also co-founded digital content provider iThentic in 2006 and the Canadian broadcaster Hollywood Suite in 2010. = President and CEO, CBC/Radio-Canada =  Strategic directions  Catherine Tait presented her vision for the public broadcaster in May 2019, with the unveiling of the Corporation‚Äôs new strategic plan, Your Stories, Taken to Heart. The plan covers five priorities: global reach, digital, kids content, regions and diversity. In a speech to the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, Tait described how taking Canada to the world was the ‚Äúspearhead‚Äù of CBC/Radio- Canada‚Äôs strategic plan, in order to counter the competitive threat of the digital giants. Since being appointed Chair of the Global Task Force for Public Media in September 2019, Tait has signed collaboration agreements (co- development and content sharing) between CBC/Radio-Canada and other public broadcasters around the world, such as the ABC, the BBC, France T√©l√©visions, ZDF and RTBF. As part of the public broadcaster‚Äôs ongoing digital transformation, in September 2018, Tait announced a new streaming service, CBC Gem, at Content Canada, an industry event in collaboration with the Toronto International Film Festival. The service launched in December 2018. Under her leadership, two new audio apps were developed ‚Äì CBC Listen and Radio-Canada OHdio ‚Äì providing a one-stop destination for all the public broadcaster‚Äôs audio content (music, podcasts and radio shows). Both apps were launched in fall 2019. At the international Kidscreen Summit in February 2019, Tait committed to expanding the public broadcaster‚Äôs kids content offering, especially on CBC Gem. During her tenure, the Corporation also launched two news services for kids 13 and under: CBC Kids News in 2018 and MAJ (Mon actualit√© du jour) in 2019. At the Banff World Media Festival in June 2019, Tait announced that she would ask the production companies with whom she does business to ensure that at least one key creative position ‚Äì producer, director, writer, showrunner and lead performer ‚Äì is held by members of visible minorities, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community. In an interview with CBC/Radio-Canada reporters in Saskatchewan, Tait said she wanted to move more production to regional centres, particularly for radio and digital. This strategic priority has resulted in CBC stepping up its pop-up bureau approach at locations such as Stanley Mission, Saskatchewan; Winkler and Morden, Manitoba; northeast Calgary; and the Tsuut‚Äôina First Nation in Alberta. CBC has also increased production outside Toronto, with the national radio show Cost of Living and the podcast West of Centre both being produced out of Calgary. The public broadcaster‚Äôs French-language network, Radio-Canada, has added new videojournalists in Yellowknife and Iqaluit to cover the North, as well as a more mobile workforce at its Abitibi-T√©miscamingue station.  Comparison of Netflix to colonialism  Tait came under fire for the unparalleled comparison of Netflix to colonial imperialism in India and parts of Africa. She said \\"I was thinking about the British Empire and how, if you were there and you were the viceroy of India, you would feel that you were doing only good for the people of India. Or similar, if you were in French Africa, you would think, I‚Äôm educating them, I‚Äôm bringing their resources to the world, and I‚Äôm helping them. There was a time when cultural imperialism was absolutely accepted. Fast forward to what happens after imperialism and the damage that can do to local communities. So all I would say is, let us be mindful of how it is we as Canadians respond to global companies coming into our country.\\" TV critic, John Doyle, who is known for critiquing Canadian TV wrote about Tait's statements saying \\"CBC's problem is complacency not imperialism.\\" Tait's comments made American headlines with J.J. McCullough of The Washington Post writing a piece about the incident. McCullough pointed out an important fact about Canada's heavily government-regulated TV industry \\"Given the sensitivities of our time, one might assume the recent comments of Catherine Tait, president of the state-sponsored Canadian Broadcasting Corp., would provoke calls for her resignation. It is not every day, after all, that one spouts analogies as historically callous as hers.\\" He continued saying, \\"The guardians of Canada‚Äôs domestic entertainment industry cannot handle this reality, however, which is why Tait‚Äôs use of an appallingly ignorant slur like ‚Äúimperialism‚Äù to describe Canadians‚Äô love of Disney, Netflix and HBO has caused barely a ripple. As the Globe and Mail report on the Tait comments noted, basically all of Canada's modern cultural-telecommunication regulatory regime ‚Äúwas built in part as a bulwark against American influence,\\" and one presumably does not build bulwarks against the benign. Since bureaucrats like Tait cannot demagogue against the tastes of a public whose interests they imagine themselves to be serving, the phantom menace of an imperial America conspiring to conquer Canada must be created instead.\\"  References  Tait, Catherine Tait, Catherine Tait, Catherine Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Catherine Tait"},{"id":"57021149","text":"The 2018 Commonwealth Games (officially the XXI Commonwealth Games) are being held in Gold Coast, Australia, from 4 to 15 April 2018.

She was lost, with all hands, on October 23, 1910 on the rocks known as Hayes' Reef in Leeward Cove (now known as Lower Cove), south of Motion Head, Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove, Newfoundland during a southeast gale. The gale was most probably the last remnants of the 1910 Cuba hurricane.  History  Tyne Iron Shipbuilding Company built SS Regulus Willington Quay and launched her on 26 October 1878. She entered service with Stevens and Mawson, Newcastle. A. Harvey and Company of Newfoundland purchased her in 1897 and she served as a general cargo vessel servicing routes between Newfoundland and various ports along the northeast coast of North America. SS Regulus had a reputation as being a \\"jinxed ship.\\" In 1907 Regulus collided head-on with an iceberg off Bay Bulls resulting in severe damage. On July 15, 1910, just three months prior to her loss, Regulus collided with SS Karema southeast of Nantucket. She was en route from Bell Island to Philadelphia with a full load of iron ore when she crashed head on into the port side of Karema. The collision resulted in severe damage to both vessels and had it not been for emergency repairs Karema would surely have been lost.  Loss  On October 22, 1910 Regulus departed Bell Island, Newfoundland en route to Sydney, Nova Scotia, in ballast. At 2 pm that day A. Harvey and Company received a telegraph from Bay Bulls stating that Regulus tail shaft had broken and she was at anchor off Shoal Bay and requesting immediate assistance. Two tugs, John Green and D.P. Ingraham, were immediately dispatched from St. John's to render assistance. was also in port and offered to assist but it was decided that the two tugs would be sufficient for the task. After passing Cape Spear John Green encountered fog which grew denser as they made headway. When the tugs had reached the last reported location of Regulus a dense fog had blanketed the entire area with a strong southerly breeze blowing and seas beginning to get heavier. The tugs cruised around for hours searching for Regulus and it was not until 10 pm that evening that John Green sighted Regulus lights and came alongside. At this time three options were discussed: 1) The tug would take Regulus crew off the vessel and land them in Bay Bulls. 2) The crew would remain with Regulus and John Green would remain close by Regulus until daylight. 3) The tug would take Regulus under tow to St. John's. For unknown reasons option 3 was chosen and the crew set about to take Regulus under tow at near 10:30 pm. It took between one and a half to two hours to weigh Regulus anchor, why the anchor was not slipped remains a mystery. At approximately 1 am the tow commenced, by this time the wind had veered southeast and increased to gale force with heavy seas making. The tow proceeded at about , a pace such that both vessels made considerable leeway toward land which was spotted by the tugs crew off the port bow at about 2:30 am. The tug's crew immediately ported to avoid rocks resulting in the Hawser breaking. The crew of John Green then witnessed the lights of Regulus drifting leeward for approximately five minutes before disappearing. At day break a search was started for survivors, however the seas were still heavy and by days end it was concluded that there were likely no survivors. The propeller of the vessel was spotted lodged in a cliff at Leeward Cove which confirmed Regulus foundered on Hayes Reef in Leeward Cove. The fishermen and residents of nearby Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove immediately launched a recovery effort in an attempt to recover the bodies of the crew. At great peril they spent the next several days in the area in their open skiffs using traditional fishing jiggers to drag the bottom for bodies but were hampered by the heavy seas. At one point there were reportedly 20 skiffs on the scene. They also reported that Regulus boat davits were intact and the boats had been launched but debris found on the scene proved the boats had been smashed to pieces on the rocks. The wreck of Regulus remained grounded and visible for the first couple of days but the heavy seas were taking their toll and the vessel was breaking up. Regulus eventually slipped below the surface. A diving team from HMS Brilliant located the wreck at a depth of in Leeward Cove across a subsurface gulch on a west to east heading with her bow to the east. Despite the efforts of the residents of Petty Harbour and the dive teams from HMS Brilliant no bodies were ever recovered from the wreck. The divers reported a severe and dangerous undertow which may have resulted in any bodies being dragged hundreds of meters out to sea.  Court of Marine Inquiry  On November 16, 1910 a Court of Marine Inquiry was held at St. John's, Newfoundland with J.G. Conroy presiding. The final judgement of the inquiry laid blame for the disaster on the crew of the tug John Green. The course steered by the tug was not a safe and proper course to clear Motion Head. To safely clear Motion Head, in such conditions, an east course should have been followed instead of the northeast by east course taken.

Some attest her husband was Neper while others state she was possibly the consort of Hedjhotep. Textile goddess Tayt was the ancient Egyptian goddess of weaving, textiles, and to a lesser extent mummification. Her role was similar to Hedjhotep. The name Taytet originates from a word meaning garment. Because linen was the most common textile used in ancient Egypt, Tayt often wove or gave linen headdresses to deities and high-ranked officials. Statues of deities were clothed in high quality linen, the linen being considered divine due to its quality and attributes. Linen is derived from the stem of the flax plant: the younger the plant, the higher the grade and the higher the quality of the linen product. Due to linen's protective qualities, Tayt began being ascribed the role of a protective maternal figure. In Pyramid Text spell 738a, Tayt guards the pharaoh‚Äôs head, and helps him garner favor among other deities. In ancient Egypt, weaving was a popular commercial activity among workers‚Äô women and royal women. Later, cotton was introduced to Egypt with the Roman Empire. Funerary goddess Tayt became associated as a funerary goddess through the application of mummification bandages. Tayt is known as a goddess who ‚Äúawakes in peace‚Äù and is associated with textile offerings to garner favor from deities. As a funerary goddess, she is depicted in the Fifth Section of the Book of Caverns, which describes Ra‚Äôs journey through the underworld and his dealings with the damned. She is shown greeting Ra and Osiris in the lower register. In the Pyramid Texts of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, Tayt is characterized as a motherly figure wrapping bandages on a dead king. Mummy bandages came from the ‚Äúland of Tait.‚Äù Goddess of Tait Tayt was the tutelary goddess of the town Tait as referenced in one of the Pyramid Texts.

It is the oldest living theatre festival in the Balkans, programming international experimental performances and emerging artists. MESS was the largest theatre festival in the Former Yugoslavia and was named one of Living Theatre's international showcases in 1974. It survived the Siege of Sarajevo, during which it hosted directors such as Susan Sontag and Peter Schumann. It organized the first edition of the Sarajevo Film Festival in 1993 and still acts as a collective board member today. Today it is the largest theatre festival in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the largest in South-Eastern Europe. In 2009 it expanded its activities to the city of Zenica, which now hosts parts of the regional program. History The festival was founded in 1960 under the name Festival malih i eksperimentalnih scena Jugoslavije (Festival of small and experimental scenes of Yugoslavia). It was founded on the initiative of Yugoslavian theatre director, Jurislav Koreniƒá. It was originally conceived as an annual gathering of the country's professional theatre companies with the goal of presenting the best experimental theatre pieces of the previous year. The specificity of the concept quickly garnered a wider audience and secured visits from international experimental theatre companies, such as Living Theater from New York City, that named the festival one of its four major annual show-piece platforms. With the start of the Bosnian war in 1992 the festival's run was halted, only for it to be renamed and rebranded by a directorate of Bosnian artists and intellectuals, headed by theatre director Haris Pa≈°oviƒá, with the desire to artistically resist the Siege of Sarajevo. Furthermore, the festival organized the first edition of the Sarajevo Film Festival in 1993 under the working title Poslije kraja svijeta (After the end of the world). During this period in time the festival produced numerous pieces by theatre directors such as Susan Sontag and Peter Schumann, who entered the besieged city to take part in the artistic resistance against the war. With the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords the festival was taken over by a team of young theatre professionals headed by newly-named manager Dino Mustafiƒá. The first post-war edition of the festival hosted directors such as Giorgio Strehler, Frank Castorf and Peter Schumann. In 2008 the festival changed its original format by introducing a handful of new programs. The Mittel Europe MESS program is designed to showcase the most interesting theatre pieces from the Former Yugoslavia and the wider South-Eastern European region. The World MESS program hosts pieces from Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the Future MESS program cultivates the original concept of the festival by showcasing the most experimental and subversive productions from across the globe. Furthermore, a children's program has also been established under the name Children MESS. Theatre directors that have taken part in the festival include: Peter Brook, Giorgio Strehler, Robert Wilson, Peter Schumann, Eugenio Barba, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, Eimuntas Nekro≈°ius, Alvis Hermanis, Olivier Py, Mark Tompkins, Wlodzimierz Staniewski, Simon McBurney, Christoph Marthaler, Frank Castorf, Thomas Ostermeier, Andriy Zholdak, Rimas Tuminas, Emma Dante, Rodrigo Garcia, Heiner Goebbels Romeo Castellucci, Wim Vandekeybus, Forced Entertainment, Laert Vasili. Memory Modul The Memory Modul is a cultural project initiated by the festival in 1995 with the goal of preserving the memory of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project has worked to keep hundreds of documents, photographs and videos from being forgotten and has offered audiences new and creative works which are related to the Bosnian war as well as other armed conflicts across the world. Furthermore, the Memory Modul has produced a handful of documentary films, including Greta by Haris Pa≈°oviƒá, which documented the life of Greta Feru≈°iƒá, a retired professor of architecture at the University of Sarajevo and survivor of Auschwitz and the Siege of Sarajevo.Greta Ferusic .

There are only thirty five known species in this genus, which was discovered in 1982. H. typhlonius has a small number of close relatives, including Helicobacter muridarum, Helicobacter trogontum, and Helicobacter hepaticus, with the latter being the closest relative and much more prevalent.  Taxonomy  H.typhlonius is one of 35 known species of Helicobacter. It was previously named Helicobacter sp. strain MIT 97-6910 by Fox et al. but was changed to its current name by Franklin et al. after discovering a genetically and morphologically identical organism that causes proliferative typhlocolitis, also known as irritable bowel disease. Some close relatives of H. typhlonius include Helicobacter muridarum, Helicobacter trogontum, Helicobacter hepaticus, and Helicobacter pylori.  Morphology/Physiology  Helicobacter typhlonius is motile due to its single sheathed flagellum. It has a spiral morphology, and its size is 0.3-Œºm by 2- to 3-Œºm. It is capable of ammonia assimilation, urea production, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis. H. typhlonius is also urease- negative which is known to assist in survival and proliferation of microbes in acidic gastric environments. Additionally, it can only grow in microaerobic conditions (a very small amount of oxygen), not in aerobic or anaerobic conditions.  Discovery  Helicobacter typhlonius was isolated from the feces of immunocompromised mice by James G. Fox and Craig L. Franklin in two separate laboratories in the year 1999. The mice suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, which was caused by H. typhlonius, but the mechanism of the infection was unknown. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to copy the DNA sequence of the bacteria to be examined. PCR was an ideal method, due to the unique intervening genome sequence that is easily recognized by PCR. The sequences were then analyzed using the Sequence Analysis Software Package (Wisconsin Package, version 10.0; Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison Wis.). The biochemical results of PCR tests as well as phenotypic test results of all other 32 known species of Helicobacter were compared to the results given by the newly isolated species. After observing the results and declaring H.typhlonius a new species of Helicobacter, a new phylogenetic tree for the genus Helicobacter was created.  Genomics  The full genome was determined using Single Molecule, Real Time (SMRT) sequencing in 2015 by Frank et al. Using hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP), the sequences were assembled into a single long read. The genome of H. typhlonius is 1,920,000 base pairs in length. There are 2,117 protein-coding genes and 43 RNA genes with a GC-content of 38.8%. Compared to other members of the genus Helicobacter such as H. hepaticus and H. pylori, H. typhlonius has a larger genome. Furthermore, H. typhlonius has a GC-content that is similar to H. hepaticus. While roughly 75% of protein coding genes were shared between H. hepaticus and H. typhlonius, 468 unique protein coding genes were identified in H. typhlonius which comprises about 2% of its entire genome. Additionally, the genome contains a distinct pathogenicity island with a lower GC-content and flanked by repeats. This island is around 650,000 base pairs and compromises 75 protein coding genes which includes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that is responsible for secreting toxins to assist in virulence.  Metabolism  Helicobacter typhlonius is a microaerophile capable of oxidative phosphorylation using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. In this species, fermentation of pyruvate and Acetyl-CoA to acetate is possible in the absence of oxygen. Additionally, carbohydrate breakdown includes both sucrose and mannose and amino acid degradation includes citrulline, aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine. H. typhlonius is also capable of arginine biosynthesis through the urea cycle.  Ecology  Helicobacter typhlonius can grow at 37 degrees Celsius, as well as 42 degrees Celsius; however, it cannot be grown at 25 degrees Celsius or in the presence of 1.5% Sodium Chloride. The typical spiral morphology can also change into cocci when grown in the presence of 1% glycine, but growth rate remains the same. Growth optima of H. typhlonius is microaerobic conditions. It is typically found in the gastrointestinal tract of immunodeficient rodents and humans and is characterized by a 166 base pair intervening sequence in its 16s rRNA, which has been previously detected by 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis.  Significance  Helicobacter typhlonius is known to cause irritable bowel syndrome in both humans and animals; therefore, it is used to study IBD pathogenesis and treatment. Along with this, some research has linked H. typhlonius with the regulation of intestinal tumors. From studying Apc mutant mice, researchers were able to use polymerase chain reaction amplification to observe certain segments of DNA and narrow down the cause to two possible bacterial species: Akkermansia muciniphila and Helicobacter typhlonius. A positive correlation was established between the prevalence of these bacteria and tumor size. It has also been found that H. typhlonius causes typhlocolitis in mice that are immunocompromised. Typhlocolitis is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the mucosal lining in the intestinal tract, specifically cecal, colonic, and the small intestine.

The circuitry on the right is lumped elements. The distributed-element circuitry is centre and left of centre, and is constructed in microstrip. Distributed-element circuits are electrical circuits composed of lengths of transmission lines or other distributed components. These circuits perform the same functions as conventional circuits composed of passive components, such as capacitors, inductors, and transformers. They are used mostly at microwave frequencies, where conventional components are difficult (or impossible) to implement. Conventional circuits consist of individual components manufactured separately then connected together with a conducting medium. Distributed-element circuits are built by forming the medium itself into specific patterns. A major advantage of distributed-element circuits is that they can be produced cheaply as a printed circuit board for consumer products, such as satellite television. They are also made in coaxial and waveguide formats for applications such as radar, satellite communication, and microwave links. A phenomenon commonly used in distributed-element circuits is that a length of transmission line can be made to behave as a resonator. Distributed-element components which do this include stubs, coupled lines, and cascaded lines. Circuits built from these components include filters, power dividers, directional couplers, and circulators. Distributed-element circuits were studied during the 1920s and 1930s but did not become important until World War II, when they were used in radar. After the war their use was limited to military, space, and broadcasting infrastructure, but improvements in materials science in the field soon led to broader applications. They can now be found in domestic products such as satellite dishes and mobile phones. A low-pass filter as conventional discrete components connected on a printed circuit board (left), and as a distributed-element design printed on the board itself (right)  Circuit modelling  Distributed-element circuits are designed with the distributed-element model, an alternative to the lumped- element model in which the passive electrical elements of electrical resistance, capacitance and inductance are assumed to be \\"lumped\\" at one point in space in a resistor, capacitor or inductor, respectively. The distributed- element model is used when this assumption no longer holds, and these properties are considered to be distributed in space. The assumption breaks down when there is significant time for electromagnetic waves to travel from one terminal of a component to the other; \\"significant\\", in this context, implies enough time for a noticeable phase change. The amount of phase change is dependent on the wave's frequency (and inversely dependent on wavelength). A common rule of thumb amongst engineers is to change from the lumped to the distributed model when distances involved are more than one-tenth of a wavelength (a 36¬∞ phase change). The lumped model completely fails at one- quarter wavelength (a 90¬∞ phase change), with not only the value, but the nature of the component not being as predicted. Due to this dependence on wavelength, the distributed-element model is used mostly at higher frequencies; at low frequencies, distributed-element components are too bulky. Distributed designs are feasible above , and are the technology of choice at microwave frequencies above .Vendelin et al., pp. 35‚Äì37 There is no clear-cut demarcation in the frequency at which these models should be used. Although the changeover is usually somewhere in the 100-to- range, the technological scale is also significant; miniaturised circuits can use the lumped model at a higher frequency. Printed circuit boards (PCBs) using through-hole technology are larger than equivalent designs using surface-mount technology. Hybrid integrated circuits are smaller than PCB technologies, and monolithic integrated circuits are smaller than both. Integrated circuits can use lumped designs at higher frequencies than printed circuits, and this is done in some radio frequency integrated circuits. This choice is particularly significant for hand-held devices, because lumped-element designs generally result in a smaller product. = Construction with transmission lines = Frequency response of a fifth-order Chebyshev filter constructed from lumped (top) and distributed components (bottom) The overwhelming majority of distributed- element circuits are composed of lengths of transmission line, a particularly simple form to model. The cross-sectional dimensions of the line are unvarying along its length, and are small compared to the signal wavelength; thus, only distribution along the length of the line need be considered. Such an element of a distributed circuit is entirely characterised by its length and characteristic impedance. A further simplification occurs in commensurate line circuits, where all the elements are the same length. With commensurate circuits, a lumped circuit design prototype consisting of capacitors and inductors can be directly converted into a distributed circuit with a one-to- one correspondence between the elements of each circuit.Hunter, pp. 137‚Äì138 Commensurate line circuits are important because a design theory for producing them exists; no general theory exists for circuits consisting of arbitrary lengths of transmission line (or any arbitrary shapes). Although an arbitrary shape can be analysed with Maxwell's equations to determine its behaviour, finding useful structures is a matter of trial and error or guesswork.Hunter, p. 137 An important difference between distributed-element circuits and lumped-element circuits is that the frequency response of a distributed circuit periodically repeats as shown in the Chebyshev filter example; the equivalent lumped circuit does not. This is a result of the transfer function of lumped forms being a rational function of complex frequency; distributed forms are an irrational function. Another difference is that cascade-connected lengths of line introduce a fixed delay at all frequencies (assuming an ideal line). There is no equivalent in lumped circuits for a fixed delay, although an approximation could be constructed for a limited frequency range.Hunter, pp. 139‚Äì140  Advantages and disadvantages  Distributed-element circuits are cheap and easy to manufacture in some formats, but take up more space than lumped-element circuits. This is problematic in mobile devices (especially hand-held ones), where space is at a premium. If the operating frequencies are not too high, the designer may miniaturise components rather than switching to distributed elements. However, parasitic elements and resistive losses in lumped components are greater with increasing frequency as a proportion of the nominal value of the lumped-element impedance. In some cases, designers may choose a distributed-element design (even if lumped components are available at that frequency) to benefit from improved quality. Distributed-element designs tend to have greater power-handling capability; with a lumped component, all the energy passed by a circuit is concentrated in a small volume.  Media  = Paired conductors = Several types of transmission line exist, and any of them can be used to construct distributed-element circuits. The oldest (and still most widely used) is a pair of conductors; its most common form is twisted pair, used for telephone lines and Internet connections. It is not often used for distributed-element circuits because the frequencies used are lower than the point where distributed-element designs become advantageous. However, designers frequently begin with a lumped-element design and convert it to an open-wire distributed-element design. Open wire is a pair of parallel uninsulated conductors used, for instance, for telephone lines on telegraph poles. The designer does not usually intend to implement the circuit in this form; it is an intermediate step in the design process. Distributed-element designs with conductor pairs are limited to a few specialised uses, such as Lecher lines and the twin-lead used for antenna feed lines. = Coaxial = A collection of coaxial directional couplers. One has the cover removed, showing its internal structure. Coaxial line, a centre conductor surrounded by an insulated shielding conductor, is widely used for interconnecting units of microwave equipment and for longer-distance transmissions. Although coaxial distributed-element devices were commonly manufactured during the second half of the 20th century, they have been replaced in many applications by planar forms due to cost and size considerations. Air-dielectric coaxial line is used for low-loss and high- power applications. Distributed-element circuits in other media still commonly transition to coaxial connectors at the circuit ports for interconnection purposes. = Planar = The majority of modern distributed-element circuits use planar transmission lines, especially those in mass-produced consumer items. There are several forms of planar line, but the kind known as microstrip is the most common. It can be manufactured by the same process as printed circuit boards and hence is cheap to make. It also lends itself to integration with lumped circuits on the same board. Other forms of printed planar lines include stripline, finline and many variations. Planar lines can also be used in monolithic microwave integrated circuits, where they are integral to the device chip.Ghione & Pirola, pp. 18‚Äì19 = Waveguide = A waveguide filter Many distributed-element designs can be directly implemented in waveguide. However, there is an additional complication with waveguides in that multiple modes are possible. These sometimes exist simultaneously, and this situation has no analogy in conducting lines. Waveguides have the advantages of lower loss and higher quality resonators over conducting lines, but their relative expense and bulk means that microstrip is often preferred. Waveguide mostly finds uses in high-end products, such as high-power military radars and the upper microwave bands (where planar formats are too lossy). Waveguide becomes bulkier with lower frequency, which militates against its use on the lower bands.Ghione & Pirola, p. 18 = Mechanical = In a few specialist applications, such as the mechanical filters in high-end radio transmitters (marine, military, amateur radio), electronic circuits can be implemented as mechanical components; this is done largely because of the high quality of the mechanical resonators. They are used in the radio frequency band (below microwave frequencies), where waveguides might otherwise be used. Mechanical circuits can also be implemented, in whole or in part, as distributed-element circuits. The frequency at which the transition to distributed-element design becomes feasible (or necessary) is much lower with mechanical circuits. This is because the speed at which signals travel through mechanical media is much lower than the speed of electrical signals.  Circuit components  There are several structures that are repeatedly used in distributed-element circuits. Some of the common ones are described below. = Stub = A stub is a short length of line that branches to the side of a main line. The end of the stub is often left open- or short-circuited, but may also be terminated with a lumped component. A stub can be used on its own (for instance, for impedance matching), or several of them can be used together in a more complex circuit such as a filter. A stub can be designed as the equivalent of a lumped capacitor, inductor, or resonator. Butterfly stub filter Departures from constructing with uniform transmission lines in distributed-element circuits are rare. One such departure that is widely used is the radial stub, which is shaped like a sector of a circle. They are often used in pairs, one on either side of the main transmission line. Such pairs are called butterfly or bowtie stubs.Edwards & Steer, pp. 347‚Äì348 = Coupled lines = Coupled lines are two transmission lines between which there is some electromagnetic coupling. The coupling can be direct or indirect. In indirect coupling, the two lines are run closely together for a distance with no screening between them. The strength of the coupling depends on the distance between the lines and the cross-section presented to the other line. In direct coupling, branch lines directly connect the two main lines together at intervals. Coupled lines are a common method of constructing power dividers and directional couplers. Another property of coupled lines is that they act as a pair of coupled resonators. This property is used in many distributed- element filters.Bhat & Koul, pp. 10, 602, 622 = Cascaded lines = An orthomode transducer (a variety of duplexer) with stepped impedance matching Cascaded lines are lengths of transmission line where the output of one line is connected to the input of the next. Multiple cascaded lines of different characteristic impedances can be used to construct a filter or a wide-band impedance matching network. This is called a stepped impedance structure.Lee, p. 787 A single, cascaded line one-quarter wavelength long forms a quarter- wave impedance transformer. This has the useful property of transforming any impedance network into its dual; in this role, it is called an impedance inverter. This structure can be used in filters to implement a lumped-element prototype in ladder topology as a distributed-element circuit. The quarter- wave transformers are alternated with a distributed-element resonator to achieve this. However, this is now a dated design; more compact inverters, such as the impedance step, are used instead. An impedance step is the discontinuity formed at the junction of two cascaded transmission lines with different characteristic impedances.Helszajn, p. 189 = Cavity resonator = A cavity resonator is an empty (or sometimes dielectric-filled) space surrounded by conducting walls. Apertures in the walls couple the resonator to the rest of the circuit. Resonance occurs due to electromagnetic waves reflected back and forth from the cavity walls setting up standing waves. Cavity resonators can be used in many media, but are most naturally formed in waveguide from the already existing metal walls of the guide.Hunter, pp. 209‚Äì210 = Dielectric resonator = A dielectric resonator is a piece of dielectric material exposed to electromagnetic waves. It is most often in the form of a cylinder or thick disc. Although cavity resonators can be filled with dielectric, the essential difference is that in cavity resonators the electromagnetic field is entirely contained within the cavity walls. A dielectric resonator has some field in the surrounding space. This can lead to undesirable coupling with other components. The major advantage of dielectric resonators is that they are considerably smaller than the equivalent air- filled cavity.Penn & Alford, pp. 524‚Äì530 = Helical resonator = A helical resonator is a helix of wire in a cavity; one end is unconnected, and the other is bonded to the cavity wall. Although they are superficially similar to lumped inductors, helical resonators are distributed-element components and are used in the VHF and lower UHF bands. = Fractals = Three-iteration Hilbert fractal resonator in microstripJankoviƒá et al., p. 197 The use of fractal-like curves as a circuit component is an emerging field in distributed-element circuits.Ramadan et al., p. 237 Fractals have been used to make resonators for filters and antennae. One of the benefits of using fractals is their space-filling property, making them smaller than other designs.Jankoviƒá et al., p. 191 Other advantages include the ability to produce wide-band and multi-band designs, good in-band performance, and good out-of-band rejection.Jankoviƒá et al., pp. 191‚Äì192 In practice, a true fractal cannot be made because at each fractal iteration the manufacturing tolerances become tighter and are eventually greater than the construction method can achieve. However, after a small number of iterations, the performance is close to that of a true fractal. These may be called pre-fractals or finite-order fractals where it is necessary to distinguish from a true fractal.Jankoviƒá et al., p. 196 Fractals that have been used as a circuit component include the Koch snowflake, Minkowski island, Sierpi≈Ñski curve, Hilbert curve, and Peano curve.Jankoviƒá et al., p. 196 The first three are closed curves, suitable for patch antennae. The latter two are open curves with terminations on opposite sides of the fractal. This makes them suitable for use where a connection in cascade is required.Jankoviƒá et al., p. 196 = Taper = A taper is a transmission line with a gradual change in cross-section. It can be considered the limiting case of the stepped impedance structure with an infinite number of steps.Zhurbenko, p. 310 Tapers are a simple way of joining two transmission lines of different characteristic impedances. Using tapers greatly reduces the mismatch effects that a direct join would cause. If the change in cross- section is not too great, no other matching circuitry may be needed.Garg et al., pp. 180‚Äì181 Tapers can provide transitions between lines in different media, especially different forms of planar media. Tapers commonly change shape linearly, but a variety of other profiles may be used. The profile that achieves a specified match in the shortest length is known as a Klopfenstein taper and is based on the Chebychev filter design. Tapers can be used to match a transmission line to an antenna. In some designs, such as the horn antenna and Vivaldi antenna, the taper is itself the antenna. Horn antennae, like other tapers, are often linear, but the best match is obtained with an exponential curve. The Vivaldi antenna is a flat (slot) version of the exponential taper. = Distributed resistance = Resistive elements are generally not useful in a distributed-element circuit. However, distributed resistors may be used in attenuators and line terminations. In planar media they can be implemented as a meandering line of high-resistance material, or as a deposited patch of thin-film or thick-film material. In waveguide, A card of microwave absorbent material can be inserted into the waveguide.Hilty, pp. 426‚Äì427  Circuit blocks  = Filters and impedance matching = Microstrip band-pass hairpin filter (left), followed by a low-pass stub filter Filters are a large percentage of circuits constructed with distributed elements. A wide range of structures are used for constructing them, including stubs, coupled lines and cascaded lines. Variations include interdigital filters, combline filters and hairpin filters. More-recent developments include fractal filters.Cohen, p. 220 Many filters are constructed in conjunction with dielectric resonators. As with lumped-element filters, the more elements used, the closer the filter comes to an ideal response; the structure can become quite complex.Harrell, p. 150 For simple, narrow-band requirements, a single resonator may suffice (such as a stub or spurline filter).Awang, p. 296 Impedance matching for narrow-band applications is frequently achieved with a single matching stub. However, for wide-band applications the impedance- matching network assumes a filter-like design. The designer prescribes a required frequency response, and designs a filter with that response. The only difference from a standard filter design is that the filter's source and load impedances differ.Bahl (2009), p. 149 = Power dividers, combiners and directional couplers = Microstrip sawtooth directional coupler, a variant of the coupled-lines directional couplerMaloratsky (2004), p. 160 A directional coupler is a four-port device which couples power flowing in one direction from one path to another. Two of the ports are the input and output ports of the main line. A portion of the power entering the input port is coupled to a third port, known as the coupled port. None of the power entering the input port is coupled to the fourth port, usually known as the isolated port. For power flowing in the reverse direction and entering the output port, a reciprocal situation occurs; some power is coupled to the isolated port, but none is coupled to the coupled port.Sisodia & Raghuvansh, p. 70 A power divider is often constructed as a directional coupler, with the isolated port permanently terminated in a matched load (making it effectively a three-port device). There is no essential difference between the two devices. The term directional coupler is usually used when the coupling factor (the proportion of power reaching the coupled port) is low, and power divider when the coupling factor is high. A power combiner is simply a power splitter used in reverse. In distributed-element implementations using coupled lines, indirectly coupled lines are more suitable for low-coupling directional couplers; directly-coupled branch line couplers are more suitable for high- coupling power dividers.Ishii, p. 226 Distributed-element designs rely on an element length of one-quarter wavelength (or some other length); this will hold true at only one frequency. Simple designs, therefore, have a limited bandwidth over which they will work successfully. Like impedance matching networks, a wide-band design requires multiple sections and the design begins to resemble a filter.Bhat & Khoul, pp. 622‚Äì627  Hybrids  Hybrid ring, used to produce sum and difference signals A directional coupler which splits power equally between the output and coupled ports (a coupler) is called a hybrid.Maloratsky (2004), p. 117 Although \\"hybrid\\" originally referred to a hybrid transformer (a lumped device used in telephones), it now has a broader meaning. A widely used distributed-element hybrid which does not use coupled lines is the hybrid ring or rat-race coupler. Each of its four ports is connected to a ring of transmission line at a different point. Waves travel in opposite directions around the ring, setting up standing waves. At some points on the ring, destructive interference results in a null; no power will leave a port set at that point. At other points, constructive interference maximises the power transferred.Chang & Hsieh, pp. 197‚Äì198 Another use for a hybrid coupler is to produce the sum and difference of two signals. In the illustration, two input signals are fed into the ports marked 1 and 2. The sum of the two signals appears at the port marked Œ£, and the difference at the port marked Œî.Ghione & Pirola, pp. 172‚Äì173 In addition to their uses as couplers and power dividers, directional couplers can be used in balanced mixers, frequency discriminators, attenuators, phase shifters, and antenna array feed networks. = Circulators = A coaxial ferrite circulator operating at A circulator is usually a three- or four-port device in which power entering one port is transferred to the next port in rotation, as if round a circle. Power can flow in only one direction around the circle (clockwise or anticlockwise), and no power is transferred to any of the other ports. Most distributed-element circulators are based on ferrite materials. Uses of circulators include as an isolator to protect a transmitter (or other equipment) from damage due to reflections from the antenna, and as a duplexer connecting the antenna, transmitter and receiver of a radio system. An unusual application of a circulator is in a reflection amplifier, where the negative resistance of a Gunn diode is used to reflect back more power than it received. The circulator is used to direct the input and output power flows to separate ports.Roer, pp. 255‚Äì256 Passive circuits, both lumped and distributed, are nearly always reciprocal; however, circulators are an exception. There are several equivalent ways to define or represent reciprocity. A convenient one for circuits at microwave frequencies (where distributed-element circuits are used) is in terms of their S-parameters. A reciprocal circuit will have an S-parameter matrix, [S], which is symmetric. From the definition of a circulator, it is clear that this will not be the case, :[S] = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} for an ideal three-port circulator, showing that circulators are non-reciprocal by definition. It follows that it is impossible to build a circulator from standard passive components (lumped or distributed). The presence of a ferrite, or some other non-reciprocal material or system, is essential for the device to work.Maloratsky (2004), pp. 285‚Äì286  Active components  surface-mount packages, capacitors and resistors in chip form, and biasing filters as distributed elements Distributed elements are usually passive, but most applications will require active components in some role. A microwave hybrid integrated circuit uses distributed elements for many passive components, but active components (such as diodes, transistors, and some passive components) are discrete. The active components may be packaged, or they may be placed on the substrate in chip form without individual packaging to reduce size and eliminate packaging-induced parasitics.Bhat & Khoul, pp. 9‚Äì10, 15 Distributed amplifiers consist of a number of amplifying devices (usually FETs), with all their inputs connected via one transmission line and all their outputs via another transmission line. The lengths of the two lines must be equal between each transistor for the circuit to work correctly, and each transistor adds to the output of the amplifier. This is different from a conventional multistage amplifier, where the gain is multiplied by the gain of each stage. Although a distributed amplifier has lower gain than a conventional amplifier with the same number of transistors, it has significantly greater bandwidth. In a conventional amplifier, the bandwidth is reduced by each additional stage; in a distributed amplifier, the overall bandwidth is the same as the bandwidth of a single stage. Distributed amplifiers are used when a single large transistor (or a complex, multi- transistor amplifier) would be too large to treat as a lumped component; the linking transmission lines separate the individual transistors.Kumar & Grebennikov, pp. 153‚Äì154  History  Oliver Heaviside Distributed-element modelling was first used in electrical network analysis by Oliver HeavisideHeaviside (1925) in 1881. Heaviside used it to find a correct description of the behaviour of signals on the transatlantic telegraph cable. Transmission of early transatlantic telegraph had been difficult and slow due to dispersion, an effect which was not well understood at the time. Heaviside's analysis, now known as the telegrapher's equations, identified the problem and suggestedHeaviside (1887), p. 81 methods for overcoming it. It remains the standard analysis of transmission lines.Brittain, p. 39 Warren P. Mason was the first to investigate the possibility of distributed-element circuits, and filed a patentMason (1930) in 1927 for a coaxial filter designed by this method. Mason and Sykes published the definitive paper on the method in 1937. Mason was also the first to suggest a distributed-element acoustic filter in his 1927 doctoral thesis, and a distributed-element mechanical filter in a patentMason (1961) filed in 1941. Mason's work was concerned with the coaxial form and other conducting wires, although much of it could also be adapted for waveguide. The acoustic work had come first, and Mason's colleagues in the Bell Labs radio department asked him to assist with coaxial and waveguide filters. Before World War II, there was little demand for distributed-element circuits; the frequencies used for radio transmissions were lower than the point at which distributed elements became advantageous. Lower frequencies had a greater range, a primary consideration for broadcast purposes. These frequencies require long antennae for efficient operation, and this led to work on higher-frequency systems. A key breakthrough was the 1940 introduction of the cavity magnetron which operated in the microwave band and resulted in radar equipment small enough to install in aircraft.Borden, p. 3 A surge in distributed-element filter development followed, filters being an essential component of radars. The signal loss in coaxial components led to the first widespread use of waveguide, extending the filter technology from the coaxial domain into the waveguide domain.Levy & Cohn, p. 1055 The wartime work was mostly unpublished until after the war for security reasons, which made it difficult to ascertain who was responsible for each development. An important centre for this research was the MIT Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab), but work was also done elsewhere in the US and Britain. The Rad Lab work was publishedFano & Lawson (1948) by Fano and Lawson.Levy & Cohn, p. 1055 Another wartime development was the hybrid ring. This work was carried out at Bell Labs, and was publishedTyrrell (1947) after the war by W. A. Tyrrell. Tyrrell describes hybrid rings implemented in waveguide, and analyses them in terms of the well-known waveguide magic tee. Other researchers soon published coaxial versions of this device.Ahn, p. 3 George Matthaei led a research group at Stanford Research Institute which included Leo Young and was responsible for many filter designs. Matthaei first described the interdigital filterMatthaei (1962) and the combline filter.Matthaei (1963) The group's work was publishedMatthaei et al. (1964) in a landmark 1964 book covering the state of distributed-element circuit design at that time, which remained a major reference work for many years.Levy and Cohn, pp. 1057‚Äì1059 Planar formats began to be used with the invention of stripline by Robert M. Barrett. Although stripline was another wartime invention, its details were not publishedBarrett & Barnes (1951) until 1951. Microstrip, invented in 1952,Grieg and Englemann (1952) became a commercial rival of stripline; however, planar formats did not start to become widely used in microwave applications until better dielectric materials became available for the substrates in the 1960s.Bhat & Koul, p. 3 Another structure which had to wait for better materials was the dielectric resonator. Its advantages (compact size and high quality) were first pointed outRichtmeyer (1939) by R. D. Richtmeyer in 1939, but materials with good temperature stability were not developed until the 1970s. Dielectric resonator filters are now common in waveguide and transmission line filters.Makimoto & Yamashita, pp. 1‚Äì2 Important theoretical developments included Paul I. Richards' commensurate line theory, which was publishedRichards (1948) in 1948, and Kuroda's identities, a set of transforms which overcame some practical limitations of Richards theory, published by Kuroda in 1955.Levy & Cohn, pp. 1056‚Äì1057 According to Nathan Cohen, the log-periodic antenna, invented by Raymond DuHamel and Dwight Isbell in 1957, should be considered the first fractal antenna. However, its self-similar nature, and hence its relation to fractals was missed at the time. It is still not usually classed as a fractal antenna. Cohen was the first to explicitly identify the class of fractal antennae after being inspired by a lecture of Benoit Mandelbrot in 1987, but he could not get a paper published until 1995.Cohen, pp. 210‚Äì211  References   Bibliography  * Ahn, Hee-Ran, Asymmetric Passive Components in Microwave Integrated Circuits, John Wiley & Sons, 2006 . * Albanese, V J; Peyser, W P, \\"An analysis of a broad-band coaxial hybrid ring\\", IRE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, vol. 6, iss. 4, pp. 369‚Äì373, October 1958. * Awang, Zaiki, Microwave Systems Design, Springer Science & Business Media, 2013 . * Bahl, Inder J, Fundamentals of RF and Microwave Transistor Amplifiers, John Wiley & Sons, 2009 . * Bahl, Inder J, Control Components Using Si, GaAs, and GaN Technologies, Artech House, 2014 . * Bakshi, U A; Bakshi, A V, Antenna And Wave Propagation, Technical Publications, 2009 . * Banerjee, Amal, Automated Electronic Filter Design, Springer, 2016 . * Barrett, R M, \\"Etched sheets serve as microwave components\\", Electronics, vol. 25, pp. 114‚Äì118, June 1952. * Barrett, R M; Barnes, M H, \\"Microwave printed circuits\\", Radio TV News, vol. 46, 16 September 1951. * Bhat, Bharathi; Koul, Shiban K, Stripline-like Transmission Lines for Microwave Integrated Circuits, New Age International, 1989 . * Borden, Brett, Radar Imaging of Airborne Targets, CRC Press, 1999 . * Brittain, James E, \\"The introduction of the loading coil: George A.

This illegal trade of vultures and vulture parts is contributing to a population crisis on the continent. In 2017, the IUCN Red List categorized seven of Africa's 11 vulture species as globally endangered or critically endangered.CMS Raptors (2017) Multi-Species Action Plan to Conserve African- Eurasian Vultures (Vulture MsAP), Summary. UN Environment, Convention on Migratory Species Office - Abu Dhabi. http://www.cms.int/sites/default/files/document/cms_cop12_doc.24.1.4_annex3_vulture- msap_e.pdf Recent research suggests that 90% of vulture species declines in Africa may be due to a combination of poisoning and illegal wildlife trade for medicinal use and/or bushmeat. All trade of African vultures is illegal, as these birds are protected by international laws. African vulture trade falls under the broader spectrum of wildlife trade, with both national and international trade occurring. Vultures are sometimes specifically targeted for bushmeat consumption or traditional belief use. Poachers also target vultures, even when they are not harvesting the vultures for bushmeat or belief use purposes. Since vultures circle over carcasses, they can be used as sentinels, alerting wildlife authorities of poaching events. Ivory poachers and rhino horn poachers have thus targeted vultures to reduce the likelihood of being caught.  Bushmeat  Regions of Africa used to describe trends in bushmeat and traditional belief use of vultures. Pink is West Africa, purple is Central Africa, green is East Africa, blue is Southern Africa, and yellow is North Africa. Bushmeat is meat harvested from non-domesticated animals including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Poachers target vulture species in sub-Saharan Africa for bushmeat harvest and consumption. Poaching and harvest of vultures for market trade usually involves poisoning the birds by baiting livestock and wildlife carcasses with agrochemicals. This attracts the vultures to feed, as they are obligate scavengers. The birds eat the poisoned meat and die, making the harvest easy. However, the poisons the vultures ingest are passed along through the food chain which places the humans that consume these birds also at risk for poisoning. The two leading causes for vulture deaths are poisoning and trade in traditional medicine, these two causes make up 90% of reported deaths. = Southern Africa = There is a scarcity in the literature regarding the use of vultures as bushmeat in Southern Africa. Mentions of bushmeat consumption in Southern Africa do exist in the literature, as families in the region are reported as saying in a study on the use of natural resources, that they consume bushmeat a few times a year. However the specific use of vultures for bushmeat is not often discussed. The existing literature points to the existence of wildlife ranches in South Africa that contribute to the local economy, privately owned game ranches and Transfrontier Conservation Areas as a possible contributors to this gap. The literature also indicates that the region of Southern Africa is a hub for illegal wildlife trafficking and the illegal wildlife market. Birds are mentioned as one of the groups of animals most significantly impacted by the illegal wildlife trade. This indicates that while there is no specific mention of consumption of vultures as bushmeat, birds are still being moved throughout the region and consumption or use elsewhere is still a driver for the activity. = East Africa = Ruppell's Vulture in Kenya While other regions of Africa have higher incidence of poisoning for bushmeat consumption, the practice also exists in East Africa. Specific countries, such as Kenya have experienced high rates of bird deaths from poisoning related to bush meat trade, with over 3,000 deaths reported in a 10-month period. Countries in East Africa, such as Tanzania, have seen increased bushmeat consumption due to a need for protein and income. However, there is no specific data regarding the sale of vultures in Tanzania's markets. The limited reporting of vultures used as bushmeat may indicate the minimal numbers of vultures sold for food or represent a lack of published research on this topic in East Africa. This is similar to the lack of documentation available in Southern Africa. = West Africa = Map of West Africa West Africa consists of the following 15 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo. Of these western countries, some have fairly stable vulture populations such as the Hooded Vultures of The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.D L Ogada & R Buij (2011) Large declines of the Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus across its African range, Ostrich, 82:2, 101-113, DOI: 10.2989/00306525.2011.603464 On the other hand, there are countries like Senegal which has regions that have faced 80% vulture decline in the last half century. The trade of vultures for bushmeat, as well as belief use, is the primary factor for the decline of vulture population in West Africa. Like many other animals, vultures found in West Africa are threatened by human-wildlife conflict. A study done throughout the continent found that although vulture losses could be seen everywhere, the highest total loss per year were in West and East Africa. The killing of many species is an integral part of human livelihood in the region. Human pressures on bushmeat populations are growing more rapidly than national population statistics suggest.Barnes, R. F. (2002). The bushmeat boom and bust in West and Central Africa. Oryx, 36(3), 236-242. Over time the hunting of bushmeat has morphed from traditional subsistence to commercial trade. An increasing population and spread of urbanization has been thought to be one of the leading causes of increases in commercial bushmeat sales. Hunting bushmeat in West Africa is also an important part of the livelihood for many people who live there. It is also a big part of the culture in Central and West Africa because bushmeat is their most important source of protein. Important as this is for the humans who rely on the bushmeat, it puts the survival of many species of vultures found in West Africa at risk. There are many impacts associated with the vulture bushmeat market. Some purchasers believe that vulture parts would help them be cured from any diseases or illness they are enduring. Impacts on the environment are also a result of bushmeat acquisition in West Africa. Specifically habitat disturbance, level of protection, hunting pressure, and distance to market have reduced forests throughout the region. The consumption of bushmeat has also affected the wildlife population, but has also raised deadly diseases known as the Ebola virus. Human life is another risk due to bushmeat being eaten when it is known to be a non dietary supplement of solid food. There is a link between education and income status that evaluates why consumers in Africa are choosing bushmeat specifically. There is no large scale regional effort to address the bushmeat problem in West Africa currently. Liberia In Liberia, when conducting the experiment to test out the theory of socio-economic factors for bushmeat consumption, it was found that monthly income, years of education, and literacy were all factors that led to the purchases. Due to the lack of knowledge and monetary funds, poor income families were forced to obtain the wild animal meat in order to feast and gain protein. = Central Africa = Vultures in Central Africa are being used as bushmeat and the market for vulture meat is growing. Due to the great vulnerability of vultures increasing ‚Äúprosecutions and hunting pressures‚Äù in Central Africa has led to a heavy decline of the vulture populations and increase of vulture bushmeat in Central African markets. Although vultures are used for a variety of reasons in Central Africa, most are used as bushmeat and sold at bushmeat markets. Most bushmeat markets sell large bodied vultures which are mainly killed by poison. In a study done in areas of Nigeria and Cameroon, it is estimated that more than 900,000 reptiles, birds, and mammals are sold each year which is approximately 12,000 tonnes of terrestrial vertebrates. 8.42 tonnes of that was bird bushmeat, and vultures made up most of that. Most of the vultures found in the study were being sold in rural areas of Cameroon. Hooded and large bodied vultures are some of the most sold raptors. Combined with Black kite they make up 41% of the raptor bushmeat market in West and Central Africa. In the bushmeat market, the most frequently traded species are those with scavenging behavior, generalist or savannah habitat use, and an afrotropical breeding range. Approximately half of the vultures sold at bushmeat markets are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List for threatened and endangered species.  Belief use  Poachers also harvest vultures in sub-Saharan Africa to sell their parts to people for belief use practices, such as traditional medicine, African vudon, and witchcraft. As with bushmeat harvests, African vultures sold for belief use are usually hunted using poisoned baits. Therefore, when belief use practitioners consume the vulture or vulture parts as part of their activities, they also ingest the poisons used to kill the vulture. Vultures in sub-Saharan Africa are known for their tremendous eyesight, and many believe their body parts can be used to see into the future. Some South African belief users inhale smoke from burned vulture brains to improve cognitive abilities or to improve their luck. White-headed Vulture with White-backed Vultures in South Africa = Southern Africa = Lappet-faced Vulture  South Africa  As it stands, a greater part of the literature addressing belief use in the southern region of Africa comes from South Africa. Many South Africans do not view traditional medicine as a secondary choice to Western medicine, but rather a better or parallel treatment for ailments that Western medicines do not adequately treat. The use of vultures for traditional medicine is a prominent feature of some South African cultures, such as the Zulu people. In his study of muthi and its impacts on vultures, McKean explains some of the reasoning provided for vulture use. \\"Research confirms that vultures are used... for a range of purposes, but are believed to be most effective for providing clairvoyant powers, foresight, and increased intelligence\\". Approximately 160 vultures are sold per year in eastern South Africa alone, contributing to an estimated 59,000 consumption events of various vulture parts. The harvesting of vultures for the traditional medicine market on this scale significantly impacts vulture species population numbers. White-headed and Lappet-faced vultures could disappear entirely in approximately 27 years if drastic changes are not made to increase protective measures for these birds.  Lesotho  Much like its neighboring country South Africa, in Lesotho, vultures are believed to have supernatural powers and to personify insight and power. In a study done by Beilis and Esterhuizen, parts used for belief use ranged from vulture eyes and hearts to feathers and bones. It was observed that wings and feathers were least popular while parts such as brains and eyes were more desirable to consumers. The parts sold by healers seemed to only be Cape Griffon vulture parts. Only 11% of the 318 registered traditional healers in the capital of Lesotho sold vulture parts in 1998. Healers that were interviewed testified to the fact that they only used one vulture a year, which would translate to 35 vultures being killed in a year. But this does not bring into account unregistered healers or the high demand that exists during elections or significant events of that nature. Beilis and Esterhuizen found that if each healer used one more vulture, it would have the potential to disrupt the breeding process of vultures the country.  Zambia  Though there exists a lack of knowledge on the current status of vulture populations in Zambia, very few occurrences of vulture poisoning have been recorded. Zambia's vultures are predominantly sited in protected areas and game management areas and are believed to be healthy. The populations that don't inhabit these areas are the ones that might be seeing a decline in populations. The known cases of vulture deaths in Zambia generally happen right outside of national parks and in South Luangwa National Park these deaths were linked to belief use of vultures. Many of these dead vultures are said to have their heads removed for use in rituals.  Zimbabwe  In Zimbabwe, the Southern Ground-Hornbill's population has dropped significantly outside of designated protection areas, and is now a national concern. A study at a Zimbabwe market was conducted to evaluate the sale and use of the Southern Ground-Hornbill. 18% of the traders caught the Ground-Hornbills themselves, 18% acquired them opportunistically, and 64% are supplied by hunters. Seven main uses were expressed by market salesman: fighting or revenge, to eliminate bad spirits, protection, strength, achieving dreams or goals, preventing theft, and to bring ancestral spirits to young inyangas, also known as herbalists. = East Africa = Little is known regarding vulture belief use in Eastern Africa. It is unclear whether this dearth of information indicates limited use, or rather a lack of research conducted within the region. Scholars have called for increased examination, particularly within the countries of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. The few studies that have been conducted suggest notable differences between East Africa and more prominent vulture-using regions such as Southern and West Africa. These include differences in traditional, spiritual, and medicinal practices associated with Muti, West African Vodun, and East African witchcraft. Cultural taboos also differ between these regions. For example, some groups within Kenya believe vultures to be unclean and ugly, while others associate them with death and view them as bad omens. Such perceptions may result in limited use and market demand for vulture species. = West Africa = Belief use of vultures and other animals is a common occurrence in West Africa where practitioners of Vodun have been known to promote the consumption of vulture parts at their markets for decades. Most vultures that are killed for traditional belief use are deliberately poisoned. Carcasses of other animals are laced with poison, which the vultures then feed on, so that many vultures and other raptors can be killed and harvested with a single poisoned carcass. There are vast differences in the prevalence of vulture belief use between the various countries and populations in West Africa, due to cultural differences and different political regulations and policies. In some markets, the trade of animal parts for fetish practices have been completely banned, while in others there is a flourishing market and high demand for vultures. Specifically, vulture consumption and belief use is associated with Vodun in West Africa. In this traditional belief system, all birds are believed to help against weaknesses in the body. Large vultures are believed to help against mental illnesses and disturbances, epileptic health concerns, and to cure bad eyesight. The Hooded Vulture is traditionally buried in the ground before the construction of a new house, because it is believed to bring good luck. At fetish markets, vultures are the most valuable birds, but their populations have severely decreased and so they are becoming very rare in most markets. However, in Nigeria, the numbers of vultures at fetish markets have doubled since early surveys were taken. The Palm-Nut vulture is highly valued, and their market price is competitive. The high pressure to hunt these increasingly rare birds is pushing their population towards extinction.  Ghana  In Ghana, several vultures, but mainly the larger Ruppell's Vulture, are seen as spiritual agents. In a study measuring the reactions of people towards the vultures, it was shown that due to traditions and cultural teachings, females and the elderly had stronger beliefs and values concerning vultures. Due to British colonial rule, the use of animal parts in fetish traditional practices has declined greatly in Ghana, and vulture parts are, for the most part, unavailable. Some Yoruba women traders from Nigeria may bring bird parts to fetish markets, which were hunted in Nigeria and brought by these traders.  Nigeria  A survey of vulture parts in markets throughout West Africa showed that the vulture trade is most prevalent in Nigeria. Within the Southeast region of Nigeria, there is a group called; Ogoni People. The Ogoni tolerate vultures due to them being a symbol of their ancestors. Due their respect for it, the Ogoni do not attempt to hurt or kill the bird. If one comes across a deceased vulture, they will bury it in similar fashion to the way they bury people. A 1992 study found Nigerian farmers use the Hooded vulture in traditional medicinal practices. A survey of the fetish markets in Nigeria showed that the numbers of vultures had actually doubled overall, compared to earlier surveys. The trading of vultures in Nigeria is mostly handled by Yoruba women. There is an increasing pressure on hunters to obtain vultures, as their population decreases and their value rises. = Central Africa = left Vultures are used for physical, mental diseases, bring good fortune, improve success in gambling and betting in business ventures. Sorcery and witchcraft are the top use, and this use stems from Nigeria. The most common way to kill the vultures for traditional medicine is poisoning them through a blowgun. It is the ‚Äúsilent, cheap, easy to obtain and use, and effective.‚Äù The common poison used in Lindane and it most commonly used in Cameroon. Indian Vulture (left) Black Kite (right) Wildlife-based medicinal products are sold commercially in an urban, traditional market. The trade in vultures in markets have contributed considerably to the decline of the vultures and other raptors. Approximately half of the vultures sold are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as a threatened or endangered species. [4] ‚ÄúIn the past four years, approximately 1000 beheaded poisoned vultures have been found in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, and Tanzania. There was not a lot of readily available information about the beliefs and traditions in Central Africa, regarding vultures. The information found supported the idea that hooded vultures are the prominent vulture in the area. The use due to the demand being high, black kites head feathers are plucked as a substitute for the hooded vultures. There are several instances in Central Africa were dealers are selling vulture heads for traditional medicine. Vulture head was sold in Maroua, in Garoua 10-12 vultures heads were sold, another set of legs and a head sold in the market.  Other Causes for African Vulture Population Declines  Although vulture trade and consumption is a large threat to vultures, it is not the largest. A whopping 61% of vultures are killed by poisonings, intentional or unintentional. This is compounded by another 9% dying from being electrocuted by exposed wiring. In comparison, 29% were killed for use in traditional medicine, and 1% for food. The main reason vulture poisonings are so prevalent is a by product of another broader problem endemic to Africa, poaching. Vultures are notorious scavengers and this hurts them doubly in this scenario. With a sharp increase in rhino and elephant poaching over the last few years poachers have been poisoning the carcasses to kill any circling vultures which might reveal their position to the local authorities. Additionally many pastoralists in Africa poison carcasses to kill marauding lions, hyenas, and wild dogs. These poisoning incidents can kill upwards of 40 vultures per carcass as well as a plethora of other nearby animals.

Earnshaw was born in Blackburn to Haworth and Alexandra Earnshaw, who worked in the cotton mills.1891 England Census He became active in the Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers (Hand and Machine), a small cotton industry trade union based in Lancashire, and was elected as its general secretary in 1940. As its only full-time employee, he acted as its first point of contact, as well as leading the union and representing it on external bodies. The Beamers were affiliated to the United Textile Factory Workers' Association (UTFWA), and Earnshaw served on its executive for many years. Raymond Streat considered him to be one of the more militant members of the executive, tending to side with Archie Robertson against the more moderate approach of Alfred Roberts. Earnshaw achieved greatest prominence through his connection with the Labour Party. From 1942 until 1962, he served on the party's National Executive Committee, as the nominee of the UTFWA, and in 1951 he was elected as Chair of the Labour Party. The Observer described him as \\"serious and diffident, sometimes wrong but always quite selfless, quiet, friendly and charitable... an impressive symbol of all the simple, decent people who believe in the party's mission\\". In 1947, Earnshaw travelled to Rome with Denis Healey to represent the Labour Party at the annual congress of the Italian Socialist Party. While there, they visited Pope Pius XII. Healey recorded that the Pope reminded told Earnshaw that \\"you must recognise that you carry a great responsibility\\", to which Earnshaw responded \\"aye, Pope, and so do you\\". In 1951, Earnshaw was appointed as the General Secretary of the General Federation of Trade Unions, to take up the role the following year, when his sting as Chair of the Labour Party ended. However, he was unable to find affordable accommodation in London, and so withdrew before taking up the post. Earnshaw was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

Biography  Upon the death of his father, Antoine Salvanh, he succeeded him as master builder of the cathedral. An act dated 24 October 1554, drawn up by Antoine Fournier, notary in Rodez, gives him this title. The bishop of Rodez was then Georges d'Armagnac. , was the bishop's secretary and was appointed canon of the cathedral on 27 March 1554. It is probably Guillaume Philandrier, trained in Italy and translator of Vitruvius who completed his education by introducing him to new architectural ideas. In 1560-1561 he was one of the consuls of Rodez and was described as the \\"mestre de l'obra de la cath√©drale\\". In 1561, the bishop of Rodez charged him with the rebuilding of the ch√¢teau de Gages in the Renaissance style to make it his summer residence. He had received it in 1545 as usufruct of Marguerite of Navarre and it was falling into ruins. He built the western gable of the Rodez Cathedral in 1562, probably according to a plan by Guillaume Philandrier. At the same time he undertook to complete the southeast tower of the cathedral, but was unable to carry out this project. For the Cardinal of Armagnac, he made repairs at the Saint-Amans church, on the bishopric's terrace, at his castle in Muret. After the completion of the construction of the cathedral of Rodez, he went to work for the city of Rodez as \\"master of masonry works\\". He made repairs on the ramparts, at the Saint-Martial gate.  Bibliography  * , La Renaissance fran√ßaise. L'architecture nationale.

The rivalry between Kazushi Sakuraba from Takada Dojo and the Gracie family of Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners started in PRIDE 8, when Sakuraba faced Royler Gracie, though it actually traced back to the first PRIDE Fighting Championships event, PRIDE 1, where Royler's brother Rickson had defeated Sakuraba's stablemaster Nobuhiko Takada. The victory over Takada had served to cement the Gracie family's reputation in Japan and continue the spreading of their family art as it had happened in United States with the Ultimate Fighting Championship venture. However, the match between Sakuraba and Royler changed this opinion. Sakuraba, a professional wrestler of the shoot-style kind (a mixture of catch wrestling, judo, sambo, muay thai and other arts), dominated Royler both standing and on the ground and defeated him by the way of Kimura lock, following up with a challenge to Rickson himself. This loss was the first for the Gracie family in decades (coincidentally, by the same move as the last time they lost to a Japanese fighter in Masahiko Kimura vs. H√©lio Gracie), and marked the question whether their approach to mixed martial arts, mainly based on Brazilian jiu-jitsu alone, could still hold up against a well-rounded, cross-trained fighter like Sakuraba. The Gracie side argued Royler's loss should not be counted, as it had happened by referee stoppage, an action that went directly against the special ruleset they had requested for that fight. In order to clear this out and issue a challenge, undefeated UFC champion and Royler's and Rickson's brother Royce agreed to sign up with PRIDE, which had previously been in contact with him for an abandoned matchup with Mark Kerr. Upon the annunciation of the PRIDE Grand Prix openweight tournament in 2000, it was known both Royce and Sakuraba were going to partake, so a match between the two was anticipated. This matchup eventually realized after the first round of the tournament on January 30, as they both eliminated their respective opponents: Gracie defeated Nobuhiko Takada by decision, while Sakuraba defeated Guy Mezger after a retirement due to contract issues. With this resolution, they were slated to fight each other.Jake Rossen, Royce Gracie triumphs in Japan, Black Belt magazine, May 2000 However, seeking to prevent a situation like the Royler match, the Gracie side demanded special rules for the match. Their representative Rorion Gracie called for an unlimited number of 15 minute rounds, no judges, no referee stoppages, and only knockout, submission or towel throw as ways to win. Sakuraba found these demands inappropriate, while Royce defended himself by underlining the role of his family in the history of MMA and by pointing out he was already at a weight disadvantage in the match (actually just 7 lbs). Mark Kerr, who competed at the same tournament, supported Sakuraba's criticism on the personalized rules. Eventually, Sakuraba accepted, and characteristically joked about wearing a diaper to the match in prevision of its unlimited length, as well as learning ventriloquism to deceive the referee into believing Gracie had submitted. However, upon finding Royce absent from the rule meeting the day before the match, he engaged in a brief trash talking, criticizing the Gracie family and accusing them of hypocrisy and cowardice. Sakuraba would reveal that, although Gracie's cornermen later reacted at these declarations, Royce himself took no offense and wished them both for a good fight. The fight The match took place at the Tokyo Dome in front of an audience of 38,429 people. While Gracie made his entrance performing the famous \\"Gracie train\\" with his relatives and teammates, including Rorion and H√©lio Gracie, Sakuraba came wearing a Super Strong Machine wrestling mask and accompanied by Daijiro Matsui and Minoru Toyonaga in identical attires and masks, making impossible to tell which of them was the Japanese fighter until he unmasked in the ring. At that moment, Sakuraba revealed his hair dyed bright orange, which was part of a bet he had made with a Japanese TV comedian.Stephen Quadros, King of the World: Kazushi Sakuraba Proves that Pro Wrestlers Can Fight - and Triumph over Brazilian jujutsu, Black Belt Magazine, November 2000 Unlike Royce, who chose to wear a full Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi for the fight, the Japanese wore his orange wrestling tights. Professional wrestler Antonio Inoki and musician Eric Clapton came to the ring to present them with flower bouquets. Sakuraba opened the fight scoring a single leg takedown right after the opening bell. When Gracie returned to his feet, they clinched and went against the ropes. Unable to properly hit Sakuraba, Gracie pulled guard and attempted to seize his opponent's leg for a leglock, but Sakuraba escaped by turning his back. The Brazilian then got up and clamped to his back, only for Sakuraba to grab a Kimura lock from behind and drop down to try to complete the hold. The fight moved to the corner, where Gracie tried to free himself from the hold by raining hammerfists on Sakuraba's back and head, while the latter held position and stuck his head outside the ropes to counterbalance himself. Knowing the strikes lacked power to inflict damage, Sakuraba spent the time looking directly to a cameraman outside the ring and smiling to him, which drew cheers and laughs from the crowd. Referee Yuji Shimada separated them and restarted the fight, but the situation repeated itself, with Kazushi pursuing submissions from behind and Royce keeping himself active with short strikes. At the last seconds, the wrestler locked a kneebar that seemed decisive, but Royce managed to resist until the round time went out. At the second round, the contenders clinched again against the ropes, where Gracie threw knee strikes to Kazushi's bandaged knee. A discussion happened at the four minutes mark, as Gracie refused to let the referee restart the fight. Still on the ropes, Sakuraba gripped the Brazilian's sleeve to hinder his strikes, and when Gracie tried to free it, the wrestler capitalized on the distraction to undo Gracie's obi, allowing him to grab more freely his uwagi. In response, Royce tried to drop down to guard, but Kazushi was able to pull him up back to standing. Finally finding an opening, the Brazilian scored several punches, but Sakuraba's control on his jacket shut his offense off, at one point even pulling the cloth over Royce's shoulders to confuse him while trying to cover his head with it. Gracie attempted now a standing guillotine choke, which Sakuraba countered with a takedown to half guard. Another tumult broke up when Royce hit an accidental knee to the groin, although not by the blow itself, which went unnoticed, but by their reactions; Royce apologized to Sakuraba, and the latter signaled his understanding by patting him reassuringly in the rear, making the Gracie corner believe he had tapped out. In any case, the choke was ultimately ineffective, with Sakuraba even toying with Royce's pants while trying to grab his belt. Again, the time ran off again without a conclusion. Sakuraba in one of his signature entrance masks. The third round began with the already usual clinch against the ropes. After the Brazilian scored several punches, Sakuraba accidentally hit him with his own low blow, leading the referee to warn him. Once Gracie was given some minutes to recover, he tried a sweep, but the Japanese reversed it with a takedown and dropped him to his guard. As Sakuraba wasn't engaging him on the ground, Gracie got up and rammed him to the corner, where he looked to score foot stomps and knees, but the Japanese suddenly attacked with a flurry of right punches that knocked Gracie to the mat. Taken by surprise, the Brazilian initially opted to remain on the mat to stay safe, although he returned to his feet when Sakuraba started kicking his legs as he had done in the fight against Royler. As soon as the Brazilian fighter got up, Sakuraba landed a heavy low kick that made Gracie falter noticeably. During the next minutes, Royce attempted to reestablish the clinch, only for the now openly offensive Sakuraba to land both punching combinations and low kicks in every attempt. Shortly after, Sakuraba added theatrical Mongolian chops to his offense, using them to set up strikes and confuse his opponent. Royce eventually accomplished the clinch, but just a few seconds before the end of the round. Finally acknowledging he was facing unexpected difficulties, Gracie decided to focus completely on the match instead of looking up to continue on the tournament. He started the fourth round aggressively, but Sakuraba grabbed his uwagi and dragged it around to nullify Gracie's offense. The Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert dropped down to his guard in an attempt to avoid the new tactic, which Sakuraba capitalized on to control him further by grabbing his gi trousers. This forced Gracie to stand up and keep himself mobile to avoid more grabs, but at the same time allowed Sakuraba to score more punching combinations and low kicks, clearly seeking to accumulate damage on Gracie's legs. Already limping and with a cut on his eye, Royce returned to his previous offensive strategy and tried his best to take Sakuraba down, but although he managed to capture Sakuraba's back, the shoot wrestler blocked all his takedown attempts. The round ended with Sakuraba on Gracie's half guard. Sakuraba opened the fifth round with a low kick and a takedown, showing no signs of fatigue yet in stark contrast to his clearly worn down opponent. He besieged Royce's closed guard and landed ground and pound in the form of punches and Mongolian chops, which forced Gracie to open his legs. At that moment, the Japanese grabbed the Brazilian's trousers and dumped him over his head, capitalizing on the confusion to score several punches to the face. Gracie answered with a few strikes from the bottom and avoided a guard pass by establishing a butterfly guard, but Sakuraba stood up and scored a clean stomp on Gracie's face before the time expired. Tokyo Dome. At the opening of the sixth round, Sakuraba took Gracie down and attacked his guard again. This time, Gracie hit a few heel kicks to the back of Sakuraba's head, pursuing an Ezequiel choke from the bottom that was unsuccessful. With both fighters standing again, Sakuraba landed repeated low kicks, punishing his opponent's legs even when the latter dropped to the mat in an attempt to avoid it. Gracie was able to slow the pace standing by ramming Sakuraba against a corner, but by this point the Brazilian was too exhausted and worn to follow up with a takedown attempt or a try to capture his back. A new low kick by the shoot wrestler sent Gracie to the mat, where Sakuraba rained strikes and punches through his guard. Sensing the final of the bout was approaching, Gracie tried takedowns and guard pulls in a last attempt, only for Sakuraba to block all of them and keep punishing his legs with kicks. The Japanese then jumped high over the jiu-jitsu expert's guard and landed a heavy flying punch just before the end of the time. During the rest, Royce sat on his corner stool and informed his teammates he was unable to walk because the damage to his legs (one of his femurs would be found to be fractured due to the accumulated kicks), and after some deliberation, finally Rorion Gracie threw the towel to concede the fight. Sakuraba was declared the winner after 90 minutes of fighting. Despite the effort of such a fight, Sakuraba chose to advance round and continue fighting through the card, which put in a match minutes later against Igor Vovchanchyn. The Japanese performed dominantly enough to be granted an extra round, but the effects of his previous battle showed up and he decided to bow out of the tournament, being eliminated. Reception Renzo Gracie, Royce's second cousin, praised Sakuraba's skill and became his next opponent. The match was not only met with appraisal, but also called one of the greatest matches in MMA history. Only in 2000, Dave Meltzer from Wrestling Observer Newsletter gave it the MMA Match of the Year award, while years later, Stephen Quadros put it as the receiver of \\"the biggest ovation he witnessed in his entire career\\", the first of many \\"pivotal events in mixed martial arts\\",Stephen Quadros, 5 Pivotal Events in Mixed-Martial Arts History as Seen Through the Eyes of \\"The Fight Professor\\". Black Belt magazine, October 2003 and \\"the greatest fight in PRIDE Fighting Championships\\". These consideration have been echoed through the years, with Brain Knapp of Sherdog calling the fight \\"its historical significance off the charts\\", Mike Sloan from the same website placing it as the second top mixed martial arts bout ever, Pedro Olavarria from Fightland comparing it to the \\"Fight of the Century\\" between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali, and Jonathan Snowden stating in SB Nation that it \\"changed MMA history forever\\". In his book UFC's Ultimate Warriors: The Top 10, mixed martial arts insider Jeremy Wall commented: \\"No fight in MMA history, before or since, has come close to that length and still remained an exciting bout.\\" The fight, along with his performance the rest of the year, gained Sakuraba Wrestling Observer Newsletter¬¥s 2000 Best Shootfighter and Tokyo Sports's Most Valuable Player awards, and cemented his rising status as PRIDE's main Japanese player. Also, even although defeated, Gracie also experienced a surge in popularity due to his own performance and will to fight through the many rounds. However, attention was put in the symbolic passing of the torch between Gracie, the original mixed martial arts icon and popularizer of groundfighting, and Sakuraba, the new generation fighter and emissary of a well-rounded fighting game. In his article \\"Sakuraba and NHB Fighting\\" for Black Belt in October 2000, Steven Keckan pondered: \\"Ten years ago, the no-holds-barred was still on its infancy in the United States and jujutsu stylists dominated the fighting circuit. [...] Now Sakuraba is turning the tables on the jujutsu fighters.\\" He also concluded: \\"Other fighters should study this man carefully. We have seen the future of NHB fighting, and its name is Sakuraba.\\"Steven Keckan, Sakuraba and NHB Fighting, Black Belt magazine, October 2000 Reception within the Gracie family was positive too. Renzo Gracie, second cousin to Royce, praised Sakuraba's spirit, fighting skill and entertaining ability during the fight, and stated he would fight him in the future. Royce and Rorion themselves appreciated his opponent's intelligence, and the former stated his belief Sakuraba would have won the entire tournament had not met him on the bracket. Royce also claimed he was willing to rematch him under different special rules, an idea supported by then PRIDE executive Naoto Morishita. However, this rematch didn't materialize, so Sakuraba fought Renzo instead in August at PRIDE 10. While there was expectation towards a possible match between Sakuraba and Rickson Gracie, whom the Japanese fighter had originally challenged after his bout with Royler, Morishita considered it improbable due to Rickson's own demands. Rematch In May 2007, seven years after their fight, it was announced a rematch between Sakuraba and Gracie as part of the Dynamite!! USA event in June co-produced between K-1 and EliteXC. The announcement met a mixed reception, as while Gracie had fought only 4 bouts in the hiatus, Sakuraba had added a number of 21 fights to his record and was considered to be in significantly deficient health due to their toll. It was even questioned whether he could pass the medical tests mandated by the California State Athletic Commission, especially after he fainted during training months earlier and was diagnosed with vertebrobasilar damage, though he eventually passed them without trouble. Gracie, while acknowledged as in much better shape, was confident in that the Japanese fighter could fight him. The Brazilian fighter had cross-trained in muay thai for his previous fight against Matt Hughes at UFC 60, while the Japanese had polished his own skills in said art in the Chute Boxe camp after his bouts against CB member Wanderlei Silva. =The fight= Royce made his entrance to the event wearing his trademark gi, but this time he took it off in order to fight in MMA shorts. Sakuraba followed shortly after, wearing a Chute Boxe jersey and a series of wrestling masks that he went peeling off theatrically while walking the ramp. Sakuraba opened this fight by immediately knocking Royce down with a low kick and a right hand. Choosing to remain on the mat, the Brazilian defended with vigorous punches and upkicks when Sakuraba threatened with an ankle lock, so the Japanese resorted to kick his legs in trademark fashion, an exchange that drew boos from the crowd. When the Japanese fighter finally acceded to engage Gracie on the ground, he passed his guard with some punches and captured his back on the side, forcing Royce to stand up. After some struggle, in a reminiscence of their first match, Sakuraba grabbed a Kimura lock attempt and caused them to go between the ropes while Gracie struck him in an attempt to get free. The round ended with both exchanging kicks again. At the next round, Sakuraba blocked a takedown attempt and tried to attack, but Royce charged with a clinch against the ropes. Advised of the wrestler's long time injury, Gracie focused his efforts in landing knees at Sakuraba's bandaged knee. The action slowed down while they fought at the clinch, which attracted again the crowd's disapproval, and it was only interrupted when referee Mario Yamasaki restart. Retaking the action, Sakuraba stopped another takedown and landed several knees from a classic muay thai clinch. In response, Royce moved them against the ropes, where they exchanged body shots and knees until the end of the round. Both fighters acknowledged the other's effort and hugged in the rest time. At the third and final round, the Japanese scored a takedown. When Royce answered with a Kimura lock attempt from his guard, Sakuraba capitalized on it to pass his guard and catch his back. Gracie stood up, but Sakuraba threatened him again with his own Kimura attempt, so the Brazilian threw strikes at his head, although the wrestler managed to block most of them with his glove and shoulder. With 40 seconds remaining, Gracie shot for two takedowns, but Sakuraba blocked them, captured his back again and started to work for an armbar while Gracie defended. However, the time expired with the Japanese still pursuing the submission. After the match, judges Richard Bertrand, Nelson Hamilton and Cecil Peoples scored the contest as 30-27, 29-28, and 29-28, all three for Gracie, who was thus declared winner by unanimous decision. Sakuraba and him hugged again and were greeted on the ring by H√©lio Gracie. =Reception= In marked contrast to their first bout, the match's reception was negative. Not only the fight was considered \\"lackluster\\" or even \\"embarrassing\\" by a number of reviewers, the very decision of the judges to award Gracie the victory instead of Sakuraba garnered a heated controversy. In its official play-by-play of the match, Sherdog actually scored the bout two rounds to one in favor of Sakuraba, a score agreed upon by a majority of fans polled on the site, and deemed him the victor over Gracie. Even Jake Rossen's later review from the same website, while criticizing both men's performances and ultimately considering the match a draw, disagreed with Gracie being given all the three rounds. The sentiment was summed by MMA Oddsbreaker by stating: \\"no one but Royce can say with much confidence that he beat Sakuraba that night\\". Chemical formula of Nandrolone. On 14 June, the CSAC revealed Gracie had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, a performance enhancing drug banned in all professional sports, in his pre and postfight drug tests. While Nandrolone occurs naturally in the human body in amounts between 2 ng/mL and 6 ng/mL, both of Gracie's samples provided a level of over 50 ng/mL, ruling out the possibility of a false positive. He was suspended for 12 months after the date of the match and fined with $2,500, the maximum penalty allowable in California. Gracie pleaded ignorance and claimed he had not increased any mass for the match, but this was contradicted by observation and an official ESPN article about their official weights. Unlike most MMA promotions in American ground, Dynamite!! could not legally overturn the result of the match due to an infraction, so Royce's victory was kept in his record. Nevertheless, the revelation impacted even more negatively on the sport's perception of the Brazilian fighter and his achievement, eventually becoming one of the top steroid scandals in MMA history. Carlos Matallanas from El Confidencial wrote: \\"what may have been the definitive redemption of the Gracies turned out another taint, this time indelible, in the honor of their family\\".

Isolation and original classification as Zymophilus  Propionispira rafinnosivorans was first isolated as Zymophilus raffinosivorans in January 1990 by Schleifer et al., spoiled beer and pitching yeast were examined to characterize enigmatic bacterial species and their ecological significance in beer spoilage. Once collected, microbes were inoculated into a modified medium which consisted of peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, glucose, NaCl, hydrated MgSO4, MnSO4, a solution of KH2PO4, cysteine hydrochloride, and resazurin. 47 separate strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were observed and recorded. A new genus, Zymophilus, was identified and separated into two distinct species, Zymophilus paucivorans and Zymophilus raffinosivorans, Zymophilus rafinosivorans was originally identified as being the type species.  Reclassificiation and methods utilized  More recently, Ueki et al. 2014 reevaluated the species Z. raffinosivorans and Propionispira arboris, by comparing them to a new strain of Negativicutes, WK011T, as well as the original type species, Zymophilus paucivorans.Ueki A, Watanabe M, Ohtaki Y, Kaku N, Ueki K.

Holdeman, W. E. C. Moore; Roll-tube techniques for anaerobic bacteria, The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Volume 25, Issue 12, 1 December 1972, Pages 1314‚Äì1317 The media in the tubes was Peptone Yeast Agar containing trypticase, yeast extract, Na2CO3, L-cysteine hydrochloride dihydrate and sodium resazurin. Strain WK011T was then sequenced and found to have a 95% genome similarity to both Z. raffinosivorans and Propionispira arboris. Based on this evidence, both species were combined into the species Propionispira raffinosivorans comb nov. The other member of its genus, Zymophilus paucivorans, was incorporated into the genus Propionispira as Propionispira paucivorans comb nov. The following type strains, or bacterial strains which exemplify the characteristics defining a genus and species, have been identified in Propionispira raffinosivorans: OW8, OW9, 0W10/1, and OWQ10/2. Strain WK011T was proposed as a new species of the genus Propionispira, Propionispira arcuata sp. nov. = Etiology of Genus and species name = The genus name, Propionispira, can be divided into two parts: Propioni-, coming from the Latin word Propionicum, meaning Propionic acid former, and spira, coming from the Latin word -spira, meaning coil.Schink, Bernhard. Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria. American Cancer Society. pp. 1‚Äì4. Raffinosi- comes from the Latin word, Raffinosum, meaning raffinose and -vorans comes from the Latin word, vorare, meaning to eat or devour.Vos, Paul, et al. Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Vol. 3, Springer Science & Business Media, 2011. Web. This organism's full name identifies its coil-like morphology and ability to utilize raffinose as a carbon source to produce propionic acid. = Closely related species = The closest relatives are Selenomonas lactifex, Pectinatus frisingensis, Propionispira arboris, Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus, Propionispira arcuata sp. nov, and Propionispira paucivorans comb. nov, which can all be found in the class Negativicutes. This relation is based on genomic similarity as well as the ability of these organisms to stain gram-negative, even though they are found in the Gram-positive phylum of Firmicutes. The main identifying characteristic which differentiates Propionispira sp. from other Negativicutes, is the presence of the cross-linked diamine, meso- diaminopimelic acid, which is covalently bonded to Œ±-carboxyl group of D-configuration glutamic acid within peptidoglycan cell walls. This covalent bond causes the a-carboxyl group of glutamic acid to be replaced by cadaverine, which is an indicator of Propionispira sp., the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane, specifically lipid F, is indicative of Propionispira sp. as well.  Morphology  Propionispira raffinosivorans is a motile, non-spore forming, Gram-negative bacterium. Although, repeated subculturing has been able to cause a loss of motility in this organism. Its cell shape is a curved, helical rod which can be found alone, paired, or in groups. Cell size can range from a length of 1.0‚Äì2.3 ¬µm and a width of 0.3‚Äì0.5 ¬µm. When plated on MRS agar, or De Man; Rogosa; and Sharpe agar, P. paucivorans produces smooth and circular colonies, which contain a yellow tint and range from 1-2mm in diameter.EMD Chemicals, MRS Agar Archived 2009-04-30 at the Wayback Machine., 2002.  Metabolism and physiology  P. raffinosivorans is classified as an obligate anaerobic chemoorganotroph, but its specific electron acceptors and donors have remained elusive. P. raffinosivorans can ferment glucose, cellobiose, maltose, fructose, mannitol, mannose, ribose, sucrose, and arabinose to produce acid. It produces propionic acid, carbon dioxide, and acetic acid as products of its fermentative metabolic pathway. It does not produce acid when fermenting amygdalin, glycogen, erythritol, dulcitol, inositol, inulin, starch, melezitose, melibiose, trehalose, raffinose, and xylose. The KEGG database shows that P. raffinosivorans has genes encoding for oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and carbon fixation, allowing it to use a variety of substrates for energy. P. raffinosivorans has an optimum growth temperature of 30¬∞C and is able to survive concentrations of ethanol around or below 5%. Also, it can grow at pH levels at or greater than 4.3 The ecological significance of this organism has only been researched in the context of beer spoilage and its appearance has been noted in a bioreactor containing cow feces, pitching yeast, and anaerobic beer packaging.  Genome  The genome of P. raffinosivorans DSM 20765 is the only strain of this species to be completely sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 technology by the DOE's Joint Genome Institute on April 24, 2013, allowing quantification of genome length at 4.13 Megabp. The Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing method aided in sequence identification, developed by Staden et al. 1979, in which DNA was fragmented randomly and amplified to produce overlap between short sequences of DNA, which were then used in primary assembly.Staden, R (1979). \\"A strategy of DNA sequencing employing computer programs\\".

Both P. raffinosivorans and P. paucivorans strains are known to have a habitat connected exclusively to breweries. Strains of P. raffinosivorans have been identified from brewing related sources including pitching yeast, spoiled beer, and brewery wastes. 10 strains were identified in pitching yeast and 4 strains in brewery waste by Schleifer et al. in 1990 using 16SrRNA sequencing via reverse transcriptase, a Biosearch Cyclone DNA synthesizer to design primers complementary to conserved 16SrRNA sequences, and terminal transferase. DNA hybridization, via conserved sequences targeted by DNA probes, was then used in conjunction with 16SrRNA sequencing to determine evolutionary distances between 47 organisms isolated from the same sources and to create an unrooted phylogenetic tree. Hops have been shown to have antimicrobial effects, due to Iso-alpha acids, against gram-positive organisms, which are resisted by pseudo-gram-positive organisms like those in the class Negativicutes, such as P. raffinosivorans.Denis De Keukeleire. \\"Fundamentals of beer and hop chemistry\\".

The effects of hops and the production of acids by P. raffinosivorans, as well as increasing ethanol concentrations due to fermentation by yeast, contribute to decreased competition by fastidious bacterial species, in the volatile environment of packaged beer. These same acids, produced by P. raffinosivorans, which decrease the pH of packaged beer and limit competition, also cause the off- flavour and spoilage of beer.  Importance  Propionispira raffinosivorans has been considered a potential spoiler of beer since it was first isolated, but it was not until 2008 that evidence for this theory was apparent. The advancement of beer bottling techniques, aimed at decreasing the oxygen content of beer to prevent spoilage, was shown to correlate with an increase in obligate anaerobic bacterial contamination. This technology was specifically aimed at reducing Lactobacillus sp., which account for nearly 70% of beer spoilage, but had unintended effects because it increased the prevalence of anaerobic spoilage bacteria in beer. P. raffinosivorans produces acetic acid as one of its major by-products of fermentation, which can increase the flavor of beer to a certain degree but will quickly produce inimical effects at higher concentrations.Vontrobov√°, Eva & KOPECK√Å, Jana & Rotkova, Gabriela & Matoulkov√°, Dagmar. (2017). Factors Influencing the Production of Sensory Active Substances in Brewer's and Wine Yeast. Kvasny Prumysl. 63. 173-189. 10.18832/kp201720. This shows that P. raffinosivorans can produce enough acid to spoil beer, even though few fermentable sugars are available in packaged beer, which has created interest in further study of its metabolic pathways. Because of these reasons, the brewing industry has shown an increased interest in the factors that prevent the growth of beer spoilage organisms, to increase the shelf life of their products and minimize financial losses.

The region has yielded the GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts written in GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ Prakrit the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered (1st century CE). GandhƒÅra was also home to a unique Buddhist artistic and architectural culture which blended elements from Indian, Hellenistic, Roman and Parthian art.Kurt Behrendt, Pia Brancaccio, Gandharan Buddhism: Archaeology, Art, and Texts, 2006 p. 10 Buddhist GandhƒÅra was also influential as the gateway through which Buddhism spread to Central Asia and China.Lancaster, Lewis R. \\"The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalogue\\". www.acmuller.net. Retrieved 4 September 2017. Overview In the view of Buddhist sources, GandhƒÅra was one of the so-called great regions (mahjanapada) of ancient India (a geographical concept that included many other parts of modern South Asia). Under the Mauryan empire (ca. 300‚Äì185 BCE), its capital was the city of Taxila.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 49-50 The center of ancient GandhƒÅra was the Peshawar basin in northwestern Pakistan which extends westward into Afghanistan along the Kabul River.Neelis, Jason, Buddhism in GandhƒÅra, Oxford Bibliographies This region exerted cultural and linguistic influence on what has been called \\"Greater GandhƒÅra\\" which encompasses the surrounding areas eastwards across the Indus River (such as Taxila), north towards the Swat Valley and Upper Indus, west towards Bamiyan and across the Hindu Kush into Bactria and the Oxus river valley.Neelis, Jason, Buddhism in GandhƒÅra, Oxford Bibliographies The Indian emperor Ashoka (ca. 268‚Äì233 BCE) erected edicts in the region, some of which use the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language and the Kharosthi script later used by GandhƒÅran Buddhists. These edicts confirm the existence of Buddhism in GandhƒÅra during his reign.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 49-51 Kharosthi inscriptions have been found as far West as Wardak along the Kabul river, Uzbekistan (Termez) and Tajikistan (Anzhina- Tepe) and as far south as Mohenjo-Daro and Baluchistan.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 52 According to Xuanzang, there were six great stupas founded by Ashoka in GandhƒÅra, the largest of which is the Dharmarajika Stupa at Taxila. The archaeological and epigraphic evidence points to the first monasteries and stupas dating from the end of the third century BCE.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 55 The Indo-Greek Kingdoms later controlled the area, and some of their kings, such as Menander I (ca. 155‚Äì130), were seen as promoters of Buddhism in Buddhist sources.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 56 The Greek artistic culture strongly influenced the art of GandhƒÅran Buddhism, which saw the first representations of anthropomorphic Buddhas, with Greco-Buddhist art styles that can be seen in the drapery and hair style.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors). The Spread of Buddhism, Brill, p. 58 Successive conquerors of the region included the Indo- Scythians and the Indo-Parthians. The Kushan empire (30‚Äì375 CE) also patronized the Buddhist religion of GandhƒÅra, supporting monasteries and stupa building. It is not until the 1st and 2nd centuries CE that a significant number of Buddhist centers were founded in GandhƒÅra.Kurt A. Behrendt, The Buddhist architecture of Gandhara, Handbuch der Orientalistik BRILL, 2004, p. 13 A typical Buddhist center included monasteries adjacent to a central stupa containing relics of the Buddha, which was the central focus of lay and monastic veneration and donations in the forms of sculptural images.Behrent, Kurt. Gandhara, metmuseum.org Under Kanishka the Great (128‚Äì151), Buddhist stupas and monasteries were built in the GandhƒÅran city of Peshawar (Skt. Purusapura), the capital of the Kushan empire.Heirman, Ann; Bumbacher, Stephan Peter (editors).

The Muslim invasions of India caused further damage to the Buddhist culture in GandhƒÅra, and it eventually ceased to exist from the region by approximately 1200 CE.Kurt Behrendt, Pia Brancaccio, Gandharan Buddhism: Archaeology, Art, and Texts, 2006 p. 11 Art and architecture Early Mahayana Buddhist triad. From left to right, a Kushan devotee, Maitreya, the Buddha, Avalokitesvara, and a Buddhist monk. 2nd‚Äì3rd century, Gandhara Evolution of the Butkara stupa Because the region was at a cultural crossroads, the art of the GandhƒÅran Buddhists was a fusion of Greco-Roman, Iranian and Indian styles.Kurt Behrendt, Pia Brancaccio, Gandharan Buddhism: Archaeology, Art, and Texts, 2006 p. 10 Initially, Buddhist art was aniconic, but Greco-Roman influences led to the emergence of anthropomorphic depictions of the Buddha in the 1st century CE.Gandhara, bundeskunsthalle.de The height of this artistic style was during the Kushan empire. Many examples of GandhƒÅran Buddhist sculpture have been found, showing the influence of Greco- Roman sculpture. GandhƒÅran architecture can be divided into four major phases:Kurt A. Behrendt, The Buddhist architecture of Gandhara, Handbuch der Orientalistik BRILL, 2004, p. 7-11 *Phase I (ca. 200 BCE - middle 1st century CE), characterized by sacred structures in and around Sirkap, Butkara I and the earliest remains of the Dharmarajika complex. This phase pre-dates the popularization of Buddha images. * Phase II (ca. middle to late 1st century CE to early 3rd century CE) - Characterized by the expansions of Butkara I and Dharmarajika complex by the addition of stupas, relic shrines and monasteries. Narrative reliefs on the biography of the Buddha are central to this phase, which include anthropomorphic images of the Buddha. * Phase III (early 3rd century CE to late 5th century CE), a period of great prosperity, the phase I and II sites are enlarged and modified. A focus on devotional images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and the shrines to house them can also be seen, and towards the end of this period, monumental imagery appears (some more than 11m high). Stupas became embellished with rows of Buddhas and Bodhisattva statues. * Phase IV (ca. 5th century to 8th century CE), a poorly understood phase, during which patronage declined and sculptures were moved and reused in the Peshawar basin. Patronage endured in the Swat valley however, and many rock cut Buddha figures were created. Likewise, in Afghanistan, many sculptures were built, including the Buddhas of Bamiyan. Buddhist texts The GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts are the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered (circa 1st century CE). The material is scattered throughout several collections around the world, and is very fragmentary. Most are in the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language and the Karosthi script, on either birchbark manuscripts or palm leaf. GandhƒÅran manuscripts have been found for all major Buddhist genres including prose sutras, poetry, Abhidharma, Vinaya, Avadana, Commentaries and MahƒÅyƒÅna texts.Salomon, Richard, The Buddhist Literature of Ancient GandhƒÅra, An introduction with Selected Translations. Material which parallels Pali Canon texts has been found, such as the Rhinoceros Sutra (GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´: Khargavi·π£a·πáa- sutra) and a parallel to the Anattalakkhana Sutta.Andrew Glass, Mark Allon. Four Gandhari Samyuktagama Sutras, page 5; page 15. MahƒÅyƒÅna Pure Land s≈´tras were brought from the GandhƒÅra region to China as early as AD 147, with the work of Kushan monk Lokak·π£ema who translated important Mahayana sutras like the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra. The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language.Mukherjee, Bratindra Nath.

During the Greek and Kushan eras, the Khyber pass was an important trade route and a key highway connected Peshawar with Bactria (and the city of Balkh, or Bactra) through the pass.Samad, Rafi-us, The Grandeur of Gandhara. The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys, p. 224 This was the main route through which Buddhism spread to Central Asia and to China. Greater GandhƒÅra's Buddhist culture thus extended into the cities of Northern Afghanistan (e.g. Kunduz), South Uzbekistan (e.g. Termez), Turkmenistan (e.g. Merv) Tajikistan and south eastern Kyrgyzstan (in the Chui Valley).Samad, Rafi-us, The Grandeur of Gandhara. The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys, p. 224-232 GandhƒÅran missionaries were influential in bringing Buddhist culture to China during the Han-dynasty (202 BCE‚Äì220 CE), through contacts at the towns and cities of the Tarim Basin located in modern Xinjiang, such as Khotan and Turpan.Samad, Rafi-us, The Grandeur of Gandhara. The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys, p. 233 The region was briefly ruled by the Kushans under Kanishka, and this allowed Buddhist missionaries easy access to the towns of the Tarim Basin.Samad, Rafi-us, The Grandeur of Gandhara. The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys, p. 234 Important Buddhist figures from Greater GandhƒÅra who acted as translators in China include Lokak·π£ema, An Shigao, Dharmarak·π£a (265‚Äì313), Zhi Qian (220‚Äì252), J√±ƒÅnagupta (561‚Äì592), and Praj√±ƒÅ (c. 810). Vajrayana Buddhists from the Greater GandhƒÅran regions of Gilgit and the Swat Valley (which is possibly the widely cited O·∏ç·∏çiyƒÅna) were also influential on the establishment of Tibetan Buddhism. Xuanzang notes during his travels to the region (629-645) that he found many Buddhists which were inclined towards Tantric practices. The presence of Tantric Vajrayana Buddhism in the region during the 7th and 8th centuries has been confirmed by recent archaeological finds which includes rock cut sculptures of Avalokiteshvara, Vajrapani and a Vajrayana siddha figure.Luca Maria Olivieri, Guru Padmasambhava in Context: Archaeological and Historical Evidence from Swat/Uddiyana (c. 8th century CE) See also *Greco-Buddhism *Buddhas of Bamyan *Kushan Empire Notes External links * Asia Society, the Buddhist Heritage of Pakistan, Art of Gandhara * Gandhara, Met Museum * Buddhism in GandhƒÅra, oxford Bibliographies * Head of a Buddha, Gandharan style, Harvard Art Museums Category:Ancient history of Afghanistan Category:Ancient history of Pakistan Category:Buddhism in Afghanistan Category:Buddhism in India Category:Buddhism in Pakistan ","title":"Gandharan Buddhism"},{"id":"57021818","text":"The Wabigalo‚ÄìNakasongola‚ÄìSasira Road is a road in the Central Region of Uganda, connecting the town of Nakasongola with the towns of Wabigalo and Sasira on the Kampala‚ÄìGulu Highway.

Their flavour derives from lemon verbena in a melange of thirty-two plants, spices and aromatic herbs. They are made by macerating these botanicals to form a strongly-flavoured green liquor, and mixing it with distillate which is then aged in oak casks. Verveine is normally taken after a meal as a digestif, but can also be used in cocktails. Other verbena-based aperitifs and digestives are available in different regions, but Verveine du Velay Pag√®s is the best known across France and is distributed internationally.  Origins  Verbena (verbena officinalis), also known as common vervain or wild hyssop, has long been associated with divine and other supernatural forces, and it has an equally long-standing use as a medicinal plant. Later, it was hung above a bed to ward off charms and spells and used to make love potions. In the Auvergne, druids were recorded as calling for ‚Äúvirgins crowned with verbena and foliage gathered at the sixth day of the moon, decorated with mystical rings and skilled in the art of preparing potions‚Äù to sit alongside them at their major councils.  Development  The Verveine du Velay Pag√®s we know today was developed by Joseph Rumillet (1833-1916), from Champagneux, Savoie, who started his career in a distillery in Lyon. Rumillet was an apothecary and a herbalist and soon became skilled as a distiller. Lemon verbena (aloysia citrodora), native to Peru, was introduced in France in 1785, and by the age of 26 Rumillet had developed the concept of a verbena-based liqueur. In Lyon he met his wife, Eulalie Charretier, and in 1859 they moved to his wife's district, the Velay, where he set up a distillery in Espaly-Saint-Marcel. It was here that he perfected the formula for Verveine du Velay in two versions, Verte and Jeaune.Advertisement for Jeaune Verveine du Velay Rumillet-Charretier. His success enabled him in 1865 to set up a distillation plant in Le-Puy-en-Velay which he named Grande Distillerie du Velay Rumillet-Charretier, adding his wife's surname to his own.Postcard view of the Grande Distillerie du Velay Rumillet-Charretier in Le-Puy-en-Velay. Rumillet subsequently took up politics, first as a town councillor in Le-Puy-en-Velay from 1880 to 1892, and then as a deputy for Haute-Loire from 1885 to 1889. In 1886, he appointed his cousin Victor Pag√®s as manager of the distillery and its reputation continued to develop. Joseph Rumillet retired from the business in 1891 to a house in Vals-pr√®s-le-Puy which he named, appropriately, Villa des Verveines. At this point he transferred ownership of the distillery to Victor Pag√®s, who renamed it Verveine du Velay Pag√®s. The business remained under Pag√®s family control until 1984, when it was acquired by another well-known family-controlled drinks company, Renaud-Cointreau.  The Pag√®s liqueurs  Lemon verbena is cultivated, harvested and dried in the local Velay district of Haute-Loire, partly under the direction of the distillery, and partly by the Carmelite nunnery at Vals-pr√®s-Le-Puy. It is planted each year in May, growing to about a metre high and harvested before the first frost in September. In addition to lemon verbena, the process uses juniper berries, mace and some thirty other herbs and spices. Certain of these botanicals are soaked in a diluted alcohol solution for several weeks, resulting in a liquid with a deep green colour and strong bouquet. The rest are heated in special bain-marie copper stills with brandy, water and plain alcohol, capturing the aromatics and producing a rich distillate. Honey from the Auvergne, sugar and cognac are then added, creating the different blends: * Green (the best known, with 55% alcohol), * Gold (a softer blend, 40%), * Extra (with added cognac and matured for two years, 40%) * La Petite (weaker, 18%). Five and ten year-old variants complete the range. The product is then aged for a year or more in oak barrels and bottled at the Pag√®s-Vedrenne site in Nuits-Saint-Georges. About 150,000 bottles are produced annually. Other than France, it is also popular in the Benelux, Scandinavia, the Far East, and the USA. Verveine du Velay is also used as an ingredient in souffl√©s, ice creams, macarons and cakes, as well as to add flavour to certain beers. The Pag√®s distillery is recognised by the French State as an (Living Heritage Company), having excellence in traditional skills.  Other verbena- based liqueurs  Other verbena-based liqueurs in France are produced by artisan, family-based concerns, mainly in the Alpes and Massif Central. * Verveine Artisanale is also based in Le-Puy-en-Velay. It has a lower alcoholic strength. * * Verveine du Vivarais was first created in Craponne sur Arzon by Claude-Jean Charbonnier and sold under the name \\"Maison Charbonnier\\".

Early life and career She was born in Grenoble, and as a 16-year-old office worker suffered a paralysis caused by Pott disease, from which she recovered after a pilgrimage to Lourdes in 1921. Having completed secretarial training, she became a social worker and a union leader in the French Confederation of Christian Workers. The information office where she worked was used as a cover by the French Resistance. In 1943, she agreed to shelter Henry Grou√®s (alias Abb√© Pierre) from the Gestapo, and this began a relationship that would last for almost forty years. The abb√© took refuge in North Africa, but returned after the war to seek her out. He was now almoner of the \\"Maison du Marin\\" in Paris and asked her to accompany him there. Although reluctant to leave Grenoble, she agreed. His political activities took up so much of his time that she considered leaving. Post-war She was awarded the Croix de Guerre with bronze star in 1945. After the war, she continued as secretary to the Abb√© Pierre, and she became known as ‚ÄúMother Coutaz‚Äù by the people in need who visited his offices. Some colleagues referred to her as \\"Lucie la Terreur\\". The abb√© himself said that, without Lucie, Emmaus, which was founded in 1949, would never have existed. During France's exceptionally cold winter of 1954, the charity was almost overwhelmed by its task, and the abb√© appealed publicly for assistance, while Lucie Coutaz looked after the day-to-day management. As a result, the first Emmaus communities were created. At the age of 82, she again suffered a paralysis; among her last words were, \\"Maintenant, mission accomplie.\\" Her book, 40 ans avec l'Abb√© Pierre, was published in 1988.

Due to declining illness, he was unable to hunt to support his family. Sculpting became a way for Sivuarapik to support himself and his family economically until he died of tuberculosis in 1968.  Biography  Charlie Sivuarapik was born in approximately 1911 in northern Quebec, Canada. When he was about 40, he moved to a village that was being newly settled by the Hudson Bay Company named Puvirnituq (population: 1692 as of the 2011 census). Sivuarapik was ill with tuberculosis for much of his life, which prevented him from participating in the traditional male role of hunting in his community. In efforts to support his family economically, he turned to stone carving. Charlie's career was first influenced by James Houston who visited Puvirnituq in 1948 and 1950 to encourage many in the area to begin carving as a means of livelihood.Nunavik Art Alive. 2012.

He first worked with ivory mainly depicting otters, but transitioned to stone human figures with realistic, expressive facial features captured mid-activity after 1953. His carvings grew in size from small, hand held objects to larger pieces of stone, and he often used secondary materials to distinguish hunting objects, such as knives and spears. By 1955, Charlie's sculpture was more dynamic through the complex use of negative space, and his unique portrayal of mythological scenes in a realistic manner.Nunavik Art Alive. 2012.

She is known for her large-scale installations that explore identity, collective memory, and political violence. Using sculpture, video, and sound, her work has been exhibited at numerous public institutions, including Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC.; Martin-Gropius-Bau and Kunst-Werke, Berlin; Kunstmuseum Bonn, Bonn; Fridericianum, Kassel; New Museum, New York; Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille, Lille; Carr√© d‚ÄôArt-Nimes Museum of Contemporary Art, Nimes; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna; Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul; Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; ZKM, Karlsruhe; Centre d‚ÄôArt Contemporain Gen√©ve, Geneva; Nikolaj Contemporary Art Center, Copenhagen; Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem, Arnhem; Istanbul Modern and ARTER, Istanbul.  Education  Tenger received an AA in Computer Programming from Bogazici University in Istanbul in 1981. After her undergraduate studies, she enrolled into Istanbul State Academy of Fine Arts where she obtained an MFA in 1986. The same year, she received a British Council Award and enrolled in the South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education, Cardiff to receive another MFA in 1988. For both of her MFAs, she focused on ceramics. After her education, she started experimenting with bronze casting and welding. Tenger was an artist-in-residence at the New York State College of Ceramics at the Alfred University in 1994. She participated in the residency of Artpace in San Antonio in 1997.  Selected Works  The School of Sikimden A≈ü≈üa Kasƒ±mpa≈üa (The School of I don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore) (1990) is an installation with a large-scale galvanized iron pool filled with red-dyed liquid, placed underneath a set of Ottoman-era scimitars suspended from the ceiling. The work refers to the 1990 assassination of the academic and women's rights activist Bahriye √ú√ßok, while suggesting a critique of Turkey's neo-Ottomanist tendencies, militarized nationalism, and religious devotion. It was most recently exhibited at Dream and Reality: Modern and Contemporary Women Artists From Turkey, organized at Istanbul Modern in 2012. I Know People Like This (1992) is a wall installation with small found objects, including figures of god of fertility and Three Monkeys of See No Evil Hear No Evil, which evokes the elements of the Turkish flag. Following the exhibition of the work at the 3rd Istanbul Biennial curated by Vasƒ±f Kortun in 1992, the artist was prosecuted for denigrating the Turkish flag. The defense argued that the artwork did not refer to the Turkish flag, and instead criticized patriarchy and male violence. Tenger acquitted but has not shown the work in Turkey since 1992. Produced in collaboration with the musician Serdar Ate≈üer, Decent Deathwatch: Bosnia-Herzegovina (1993) is an installation with 800 water-filled glass jars that feature images and texts about Bosnia, drawn from the international media. Placed on metal shelves, the water-filled jars create a laboratory-like setting that explores isolation and archiving at the same time. We didn‚Äôt go outside; we were always on the outside/We didn‚Äôt go inside; we were always on the inside (1995) is an installation work that consists of a wooden hut, a guard booth surrounded by a barbed wire. This is a work she created for the fourth Istanbul Biennial curated by Rene Block in 1995. In the installation, the militaristic environment is juxtaposed with romantic landscape photographs and music coming from the radio placed in the hut, evoking a sense of confinement and isolation. The work offers \\"a memorial combining privacy with a sense of loss and entrapment.\\" In 2015‚Äîtwenty years after its first exhibition‚Äî, the work was restaged in the basement of a historic building in New York, organized by Protocinema, a nonprofit arts organization based in Istanbul and New York. The Closet (1997) is a three-room installation where the artist recreates a domestic setting against a background of the 1980s Turkey under a military dictatorship. Darkened with thick curtains, a dining room features a radio that narrates a football match and a news broadcast; a bedroom hosts a desk and schoolbooks of the period; and a closet presents a stack of vintage clothing. Suggesting a sense of disappearance, the piece creates the claustrophobic feeling of a particular era ridden by violence and fear. The installation was recreated for the exhibition How Did We Get Here (2015) at SALT Galata in Istanbul. Beirut (2005‚Äì07) is a video work showing the facade of the Saint-Georges Hotel in Beirut‚Äîan abandoned building that was severely damaged during the civil war in Lebanon. The work depicts the movement of white fabrics floating at the windows, placed for a protest against the delay of renovation permission. Produced in collaboration with the musician Serdar Ate≈üer‚ÄîTenger's long-term collaborator‚Äî, Balloons on the Sea (2011) is a video piece that features balloons floating on the water, ready for a pastime activity of shooting. The work explores the latent violence while suggesting an act of resilience. The work was exhibited at the International Exhibition at the Biennale di Venezia in 2017, curated by Christine Macel. I Know People Like This III (2013) is an installation that takes the form of a maze, where the walls feature images of mass street protests, police arresting people, devastation, and anger‚Äîall printed on x-ray film shown against light-box panels. The display of the archive suggests a look through the insides of a political body with illness. Commissioned by Alserkal Programming in Dubai, Under (2018) is a public art installation where viewers walk in to a free- standing structure that hosts a tree with a net. The work refers to a traditional hunting trick, using nets to get birds accustomed to fly lower.  Exhibitions  Tenger had her first solo exhibition at the Galeri Nev Istanbul in 1990. Her solo exhibitions include Where the Winds Rest, Galeri Nev, Istanbul (2019); We didn't go outside; we were always on the outside/ We didn‚Äôt go inside; we were always on the inside, Protocinema, New York (2015); Swinging on the Stars, Galeri Nev, Istanbul (2013); Perspectives: Beirut, Smithsonian Institution, Washington (2011); Balloons on the Sea, Green Art Gallery, Dubai (2011); Never Never Land, Mannheimer Kuntsverein, Mannheim (2001); and The Closet, ArtPace, San Antonio, Texas (1997). Her work has been featured at international institutions, including Centre Pompidou, Paris; Art Gallery of Western Australia; ARTER, Istanbul; Neuer Berliner Kunsverein, Berlin; Boghossian Foundation, Villa Empain, Brussels; Istanbul Modern, Istanbul; Espace Culturel Louis Vuitton, Paris; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna; Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin; Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul; Palais des Beaux Arts de Lille, Lille; Carr√© d‚ÄôArt-Nimes Museum of Contemporary Art, Nimes; Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem, Arnhem; Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; Protocinema, New York; and New Museum, New York.

He was born in Kingston, Ontario. Trotter studied at Queen's University in Kingston with bachelor's degree in 1952 and master's degree in 1953. He received in 1956 his PhD from Princeton University under William Feller with thesis Convergence of semigroups of operators. Trotter was from 1956 to 1958 at Princeton University the Fine Instructor for mathematics and from 1958 to 1960 an assistant professor at Queen's University. He was from 1962 to 1963 a visiting associate professor, from 1963 to 1969 an associate professor, and from 1969 until his retirement a full professor at Princeton University. From 1962 to 1986 he was an associate director for Princeton University's data center. Trotter's research deals with, among other topics, probability theory, group theory computations, number theory, and knot theory. In 1963, he solved an open problem in knot theory by proving that there are non-invertible knots. At the time of his proof, all knots with up to 7 crossings were known to be invertible. Trotter described an infinite number of pretzel knots that are not invertible.

It is native to Malaysia and Sumatra. This bottom-dwelling tropical fish is found in mainland Southeast Asia. Its natural habitats are streams and rivers as well as flooded forests during the rainy season. It is often confused with the Crossocheilus oblongus, however, both are algae eaters and will behave similarly.  Description  The Siamese algae eater has a black horizontal stripe extending from opercle to tail. The stripe can fade to camouflage the Siamese algae eater against its surroundings. Genuine Crossocheilus siamensis, (incorrect species) without maxillary barbels and with deeply fringed V-shaped upper lip are rarely encountered in the aquarium trade. The red algae eater is a species that is widely sold as \\"Siamese algae eater\\". It has a bright brownish elongate body with a slightly flat belly. It has a prominent brown-black horizontal stripe extending from nose to tail. This fish may grow to measure up to . It possesses small maxillary barbels and an unfringed shallowly arcuate upper lip. Two other similar species are traded as Siamese algae eaters, namely Crossocheilus atrilimes, a species that prefers Java moss than red algae, and an undescribed species of Crossocheilus.  Aquarium care  The hardy red algae eater Crossocheilus langei is commonly found in the aquarium trade and is one of the most popular and effective tank algae cleaners. They are active and fast swimmers that will school together if kept in a group, but some individuals may display aggression to their own kind or related fish. In general, the red algae eater can be kept in most community tanks and is reportedly much less aggressive than similar fish such as the Chinese algae eater or the red-tailed black shark. Because the red algae eater is effective at controlling tank algae, many aquarists like to place them in heavily planted tanks with strong lighting to prevent the growth of algae. Unlike other aquarium algae eater fishes, the red algae eater is valued for its ability to eat red algae (particularly Audouinella). The fish, however, is an opportunistic feeder and will eat pellets and most other food, a tendency that strengthens with age. The lid of the tank should be properly closed leaving no large hole for the fish to jump out of the tank. Since they can't stay in mid water, they love driftwood/rocks and some plants that can support their weight to rest on. Siamese algae eaters will often school together but are also content living solo. When two are kept together, they will often establish their own territory as they mature. They can be a long living fish, with reports of lifespans up to ten years.

Her research has shown that fishing cultures had arisen in the area at the end of the Pleistocene period, indicating an occupation from at least 11,000 years ago. In a cave shelf known as the Babisuri Shelter, radiocarbon dating indicated the area may have been occupied 40,000 years ago. Early life Harumi Fujita was born in Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan and was raised in Sapporo until her fifth birthday. Because her father was a student at the University of Michigan, the family, which included a brother and her parents, moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan for two years, where Fujita began her primary schooling. Returning to Japan, she completed her secondary studies and attended Hokkaido University. After her graduation, Fujita moved to Israel to study Hebrew and met several Mexican students in her classes. Living on a kibbutz, she became interested in archaeology, visiting various sites during her two years in the country. In 1978, she moved to Mexico City and enrolled in archaeology classes at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (ENAH). Completing her course work in 1982, she accompanied Jesus Mora and Baudelina Garcia Uranga to the Baja California Peninsula in northern Mexico to complete her field projects. Writing her thesis on the shellfish gathered by the prehistoric indigenous people on the peninsula, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in archaeology in 1985. Career Working on a waste pile in Baja California Sur, Fujita postulated in 1988, that the settlements along the coast from the remains of sea animals appeared to be transitory. In 1991, Fujita was designated as a researcher with the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and assigned to Baja California Sur working the cape region. Her initial task was to coordinate a survey of the area and document sites. Between 1994 and 1996, Fujita's survey of the Island as well as nearby Isla Partida were compiled as El poblamiento de Am√©rica visto desde la isla Esp√≠ritu Santo (The settlement of America seen from the island Espiritu Santo) and documented 127 coastal sites, which included caves, open-air campsites, shelters, and waste piles, containing artifacts, burials and cave paintings. Dated to indicate habitation between 10,000 and 21,000 years ago, the findings confirmed occupation of the island long before the arrival of Europeans. In 1996, Fujita identified the Babisuri Shelter site on the Island of Esp√≠ritu Santo. In stratum III of the shelter, she discovered artifacts made from shell that were radiocarbon dated to yield dates indicating occupation of the site at 40,000 years ago. The findings were significant, as they indicated that habitation of the Americas may have occurred thousands of years before previously estimated. Eighty-eight different dating tests were performed on the site, confirming five layers of soils and three different occupations by inhabitants for the Archaic period. In 2000, Fujita and Judith F. Porcasi evaluated methods in which early hunters might have exploited dolphins. Lack of remains, has caused many theorists to reject that such hunting occurred in northern Mexico, but Fujita and Porcasi postulated that clacking stones together underwater from the side of a boat, could disrupt the sonar of dolphins. In areas where deep water is found near the shoreline, the technique could be used to beach the animals and allow them to be clubbed or speared, as it was in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Islands. Fujita discovered artifacts in 2011, which were c-shaped hooks, similar to those found in Ecuador, Australia and along the coast of the Arabian Sea, indicating that as early as 8,000 to 11,000 years ago, indigenous peoples living in Baja California Sur were engaged in fishing. Fourteen of the hooks were definitively dated to the Terminal Pleistocene era, making the among the oldest fishing hooks known to exist and confirming that fishing cultures had emerged in North America before the Early Holocene period. In 2013, An√≠bal Lopez Espinoza published an analysis of the cave paintings documented by Fujita, Dave Huddart and Silva. Expanding her research area along the coast covering the area between La Paz and the Sierra de las Cacachilas (west to east) and between El Novillo and Tecolote Beach (south to north), Fujita identified 172 sites with significant archaeological remains. In all, her work in Baja California Sur has identified over 500 places with traces of historical value. In 2014, she located two caves near Tecolote Beach which confirm ancient settlement of the area to around 10,000 years ago in the Early Holocene period. Similarly to earlier sites found on Esp√≠ritu Santo, marine resources and shells were frequently used by the inhabitants. Continuing her work on the site, she discovered 61 burial sites, which show funerary characteristics of dual burials for the ancient inhabitants.

Early Life  Gene Merlino was born Mario Gino Merlino on April 5, 1928, in San Francisco, California, to Cesare and Teresa (n√©e Incaviglia) Merlino. His first exposure to music came from his two older brothers; John was an accomplished accordionist, and Victor took up the clarinet but did not stick with it for long. Gene originally wanted to play trumpet, as he admired Harry James, but instead picked up the available clarinet in his early teens. A few years later he had learned the saxophone well enough to start playing for dances and weddings near his Potrero Hill neighborhood. After graduating from Mission High School he enrolled in San Francisco State as a Music major, playing clarinet and achieving first chair concertmaster in the college's symphonic band by his sophomore year. He also spent one semester at Eastman School of Music.  Career  = Radio = In 1950, Merlino left college before graduating when he got his first steady musical job with the Bill Weaver show on KCBS radio, which at that time broadcast out of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Although he initially only played saxophone, he soon became the regular male vocalist, performing five nights a week. At this time he \\"realized that singing was going to be [his] main career in music\\". He stayed with KCBS for three years before moving to Los Angeles, California. = Jazz Bands = After arriving in Los Angeles, Merlino joined the jazz bands of Frankie Carle, then Ray Anthony. Anthony then started his short-lived television variety show, The Ray Anthony Show, in 1956, allowing Merlino to be seen by a nationwide audience. When the Anthony show was canceled in May 1957 after only one season, Merlino joined the Freddy Martin band, who played regularly at the famous Cocoanut Grove club in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Merlino remained with this band until 1963. = Television = Beginning in 1963 and continuing through 1979, Merlino was a regular performer for many television variety shows, starting with The Red Skelton Show. He would eventually become a regular for The Pearl Bailey Show, The Judy Garland Show, the Carol Burnett Show, The Julie Andrews Hour, the Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, Donny & Marie, and the Ken Berry Wow Show. In later years, his vocals could be heard on The Simpsons. He performed the song \\"Born Free\\" on the episode \\"Whacking Day\\", \\"South of the Border\\" on \\"Kamp Krusty\\", and \\"Jellyfish\\" in \\"A Star Is Born Again\\". = Studio Recordings and Film = In 1965 he was part of the four-man singing group that recorded the theme song for Gilligan's Island. In 1966, Merlino joined the male singing quartet, The Mellomen, with Thurl Ravenscroft, Bill Lee and Bill Cole, after Max Smith retired. Thanks to this, Merlino began to get regular work in the various recording studios in Hollywood and Los Angeles, eventually singing for thousands of movies, television programs, radio and television commercials, audio recordings, and song poems, during a career that lasted more than 50 years. His most famous recordings were as part of the Anita Kerr Singers, who won a 1967 Grammy Award (Best Performance by a Vocal Group) for their performance of \\"A Man and a Woman\\" (along with a 1969 Edison Award), and for providing the singing voice for the character of Lancelot, played by Franco Nero, in the 1967 movie Camelot. In 1973 he was part of the chorus who went on a worldwide tour with Burt Bacharach to promote the movie Lost Horizon, for which Bacharach wrote the music. Additionally, Merlino was part of the \\"L.A. Voices\\", who were nominated for a Grammy Award (Best Jazz Vocal Performance - Duo or Group) in 1983 for the Supersax album \\"Supersax & L.A. Voices\\". He also claims to have recorded more than 10,000 song poems, primarily under the pseudonyms Gene Marshall or John Muir, and was featured in the 2003 PBS documentary \\"Off the Charts\\".  Personal Life  Merlino married Lois Elizabeth Draper on November 18, 1953. Merlino met Draper in the symphonic band at San Francisco State, where she played flute. Almost immediately after marrying they moved to the North Hollywood region of Los Angeles, so Gene could foster his singing career, as there was much more studio recording work available in Hollywood and Los Angeles than in San Francisco. They had two children, Monica (b. 1954) and John (b. 1963). They lived in various parts of Los Angeles until 1995, when they moved to Camarillo, California. Their marriage lasted for 55 years until Lois died on April 3, 2009, at the age of 78.

Setty (on right) and an Avro 500 biplane of Great War vintage in 1913 Sriram Venkatasubba Setty (IAST: ) popularly known as S.V. Setty (1879‚Äì1918) was an Indian aviator and professor from Mysore, Karnataka, India. He was known as the first Indian aviator, assisting with the design of the Avro 504. S.V. Setty was also a founder professor of Karnataka's first engineering college, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore. Early life and education Setty was born on 12 December 1879, in Mysore. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Maharaja's College before enrolling in the engineering college at Guindy, Madras, Tamil Nadu. From Guindy, he transferred to Thomason College and then to Roorkee, where he completed his engineering degree. In his early days, he worked in the Mysore Public Works Department as an assistant engineer until 1909. He won a scholarship from the Mysore government to Faraday House, London, where he studied for a diploma in electrical engineering. He gained practical experience at firms in Rugby, Wolverhampton and London. During this time, he also became an associate member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. Aviation career In May 1911, Setty joined A.V. Roe and Company (AVRO), at that time the only British company specializing in building aircraft in England. On 12 March 1912, he built an aircraft with some help and tested it. His first flight was successful, even at low power. John Robertson Duigan, impressed by the maiden trial flight, complimented Setty and he even concluded a deal with Avro. This aircraft was later named the Avro Duigan. Setty's aircraft design then became the basis for Avro 500 series built by A. V. Roe. Later, in May 1912, he started designing a new biplane aircraft. The design was published in the Modern Review monthly magazine (July 1912, India), and it was different from the Avro 500. After completing its design, on 30 June 1912 he left for India, On 12 June 1912, Setty received a gold medal by A. V. Roe for General Proficiency in Aeronautics. After Setty left for India, Avro released the 500 series of aircraft, including the Avro 501, 502, 503 and 504. All of these, except the Avro 504, were similar to Avro 500 aircraft in basic design. The new biplane aircraft which Setty had designed turned out to be Avro 504, a popular World War I bomber. The Avro 504 evolved into the world's first trainer aircraft, In November 1914, the Avro 504 was the first aircraft to bomb Germany in the war. Setty designed the Avro Duigan which became the model for Avro 500 and then designed the new biplane the Avro 504. Later years In 1913, a technical school was established in Bangalore in a shed- like structure headed by S.V. Setty as the superintendent, after his return from England. He became a founder professor of Karnataka's first engineering college, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore. Death The 1918 influenza epidemic killed about a fifth of Bangalore's residents, including Setty, his wife, and one of their four daughters. He died on 12 October 1918 at the age of 38.

It operated through a series of Task Groups, each dealing with a particular research topic, and each of which produced a report published on the CRISP website. Collated recommendations were passed to appropriate funding bodies. In 2005, CRISP was absorbed into the National Platform for the Built Environment. History In 1995, CRISP was given responsibility for advising the then Department of the Environment on priorities for research and innovation, and was based at the Building Research Establishment in Garston, Hertfordshire, near Watford. =Operation between 1998 and 2003= From 1998 Davis Langdon Consultancy provided management support. Between 1998 and 2002, 13 Task Groups covering topics such as design, sustainable construction, performance and value produced 233 recommendations. In 2000, 2001 and 2002, the requirements identified by the groups were used to form action plans for the Department of Trade and Industry, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Highways Agency, and the Environment Agency. =New CRISP (nCRISP) from 2002-3= New CRISP was formed in 2002-3. An awayday in March 2003 identified a set of 10 research priorities which were incorporated in the nCRISP Business Plan published in October 2003. nCRISP Task Groups were established as follows: * Education and Skills - supported by the Construction Industry Training Board * Heritage - supported by English Heritage * Knowledge * Major Projects * Infrastructure - supported by the Institution of Civil Engineers * Value - supported by Be (Collaborating for the Built Environment, known as Be) and chaired by the English architect Richard Saxon. nCRISP also commissioned a report by economist David Pearce, The Social and Economic Value of Construction. All the groups presented progress reports to the nCRISP Awayday in October 2004, and they were finalised in early 2005. They were discussed at the offices of Mace on 16 May 2005. nCRISP was subsequently absorbed into the National Platform for the Built Environment, and ring-fenced government funding for sectors like construction ended, and construction had to compete for funding with sectors such as aerospace and pharmaceuticals.

She co-founded two groups part of the CNRS national programme on computer-supported cooperative work and multimodal HCI. Furthermore, she became the co-chief editor of the Journal of Interaction between Persons and Systems. Between 1989 and 1995, she contributed to the AMODEUS project by ESPRIT BRA/LTR, whose purpose was to promote a multidisciplinary approach to human-computer interaction. In 2008, Coutaz coordinated a group working on ambient intelligence for the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and Innovation, with the purpose of confronting societal challenges in novel ways. The group took on the creation of a field that intersects information and communication technologies, and social and human sciences. As of 2012, she is professor emeritus from the University of Grenoble.  Research  After achieving her PhD in 1970, Coutaz pursued her research interests in operating systems and computer networks. However, her research interests shifted to human-computer interaction in 1983 after attending a CHI conference. In this newer domain, her work focused on software architecture modeling for interactive systems, multimodal interaction, augmented reality, and user interface plasticity. In 1987, she created the presentation-abstraction- control (PAC) model, a software architecture model for interactive systems. In 1993, Coutaz began to work with Laurence Nigay to combine the PAC model with ARCH, a model designed for the implementation of multimodal user interfaces. She has also contributed to projects on a European and national level. Coutaz is currently working on end-user software engineering for smart homes in the field of ubiquitous computing. = FAME = From 2001 to 2004, Coutaz contributed to FAME at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The goal of the project was to create an intelligent agent which could facilitate communication between people of different cultures when solving a common problem. Their solution made use of multimodal interactions, including vision, speech, and object manipulation to create and manipulate new information based on the context. = CAMELEON = CAMELEON's purpose was to build methods and environments which support the design and development of context-dependent interfaces. They focused on methods which would promote the creation of software interfaces that are usable on various devices. = CONTINUUM = Between 2008 and 2011, Coutaz contributed to CONTINUUM. The project addressed the problem of service continuity within the long-term vision of ambient intelligence, and defined models that support service continuity for mobile users. Three key scientific issues were addressed: context management and awareness, semantic heterogeneity, and human control versus system autonomy. = UsiXML (ITEA) = From 2009 to 2012, Coutaz contributed to UsiXML by Information Technology for European Advancement (ITEA 2). UsiXML is a markup language for user interfaces, in which UI can be designed at different levels of abstraction. = AppsGate = Between 2012 and 2015, Coutaz contributed to AppsGate. Their goal was to create software that would allow non-engineers to create their own programs for their environment. With the rise of IoT, their focus was on programmable smart home devices.

It was completed in the summer of 1931. The high performance sports aircraft was an aerodynamically clean cantilever wing monoplane. Its high-mounted, one piece wing was built around two spars, with a plywood covered leading edge and fabric covering. Narrow chord ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edges. The WT-1's borrowed de Havilland Gipsy I four cylinder upright inline engine was mounted largely exposed, though with a fairing behind it. The ply- covered fuselage had rounded decking; the fuel tank was in the forward fuselage and its two seat, side-by-side cockpit was behind the wing trailing edge. The fuselage tapered rearwards, with the tailplane mounted on top. A tall triangular fin carried a rounded rudder, which reached down to the keel. Its fixed landing gear was conventional, though details are not known. An initial first flight was abandoned due to a fuel supply problem. The system was modified and a new fuel pump fitted, after which Stanis≈Çaw Szubka piloted its first flight, finding the WT-1 hard to fly because of a misplaced centre of gravity (c.g.), and damaging it on landing. After accident repair and c.g. adjustment the WT-1 was flown by Jerzy Bajan. The take-off run was short and performance high, but Bajan found its handling dangerous. At this point the loaned Gipsy engine had to be returned to the Krak√≥w Air Regiment and the development of the WT-1 was abandoned.

As in other areas of North American etiquette, the rules governing appropriate table manners have changed over time and may differ depending on the setting (e.g. dining at home, at a restaurant, or with business colleagues).  History  Table manners have an ancient and complex history, as each society has gradually evolved its system. Today, many of the behaviors that take place at the dinner table are deeply rooted in history. In Europe, Italy more or less led the cultural revolution starting with the renaissance. Italian poet Giovanni Della Casa advised in Galateo, his 1558 book on manners: \\"One should not comb his hair nor wash his hands in public... the exception to this is the washing of the hands when done before sitting down to dinner, for then it should be done in full sight of others, even if you do not need to wash them at all, so that whoever dips into the same bowl as you will be certain of your cleanliness.\\" Some other examples are: #Eat rolls or bread by tearing off small bite-size pieces and buttering only the piece you are preparing to eat. When ready for another piece, repeat the same process. (Desiderius Erasmus, 1532) #Engage in table conversation that is pleasant but entirely free of controversial subjects. (Thomas Twyne, 1576) #If you need something that you cannot reach easily, politely ask the person closest to the item you need to pass it to you. (Thomas Tusser, 1577) #Elbows on the table are acceptable only between courses, not while you are eating. Never chew with your mouth open or make loud noises when you eat. Although it is possible to talk with a small piece of food in your mouth, do not talk with your mouth full. If food gets caught between your teeth and you can't remove it with your tongue, leave the table and go to a mirror where you can remove the food from your teeth in private. (William Phiston, 1609) Proper manners were a concern even of leaders in the society of eighteenth-century America ‚Äì‚Äì Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac, for instance, included comments on proper behavior. During the nineteenth century, hundreds of books on etiquette were published in the United States.  In the home  Each household may have a unique set of rules at the table, but despite cultural differences, there are some essential table manners most families share, including rules against picking one's teeth at the table and chewing with one's mouth open. Due to changing lifestyles, table manners are more casual than they were in the 1950s. For example, some commentators contend that the common prohibition against placing elbows on the table no longer applies. Today, many families eat fast food without silverware and eat meals in front of the television or in the car rather than following past norms of gathering the family at the dining table for a meal. Critics claim that these changes have led to fewer opportunities to learn table manners in the home. Additionally, advancement of technology in recent years raises issues regarding smartphone use at the dining table. Opinions vary regarding whether the use of smartphones at the dining table is acceptable.  Offenses  The convention of avoiding putting one's elbows on the table while eating arose from a time when tables were sufficiently rustic and unstable that leaning on them could cause loose planks to disrupt the meal. However, as time has changed, it has become more acceptable to put one's elbows on the table, but only between courses, not while eating. alt= The main reason to be quiet while eating is for safety. According to the National Safety Council, suffocation, especially on foods, was ranked fourth on a list of major causes of death in American homes. In most places, it is unacceptable for someone to make disapproving or disrespectful sounds when presented with food. Likewise, blowing one's nose at the table is unacceptable. In addition, slurping food is considered offensive and impolite.  Business related  As business dealings can take place over a meal, table manners may be put to good use while dining with clientele, co- workers, or subordinates - building rapport with a client, celebrating the accomplishments of a team, or simply hosting a discussion in a non-office setting all call for proper etiquette if dining is involved. It is deemed an essential enough behavioral skill that has suffered from a decline in naturally occurring generational inheritanceGreer, William R. \\"TABLE MANNERS: A CASUALTY OF CHANGING TIMES.\\" New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast) ed., Oct 16 1985, ProQuest. Web. 30 Apr. 2018 to the effect that some schools have opened programs and classes centered around dining etiquette to educate students in the practice. Poor table manners can affect the opinion of those involved, as well as the outcome of the meeting. Many appropriate mannerisms from formal dining situations can be applied in a business setting, though variations exist depending on who is the host and who is the guest, and the relation the one has with the other. Speaking while still chewing or mid-bite may be acceptable in an informal lunch setting with often-seen coworkers, but in a high-stakes meeting with a potential customer, it will likely come off as rude. Napkins are intended to be kept in the lap. The exception is when leaving the table temporarily - placed on the chair signals the staff that the diner's meal is unfinished, placed on the table near the plate shows the patron has completed their meal. Unless the host offers to pay the inevitable bill, it should be assumed that each diner is responsible for their own bill, and the staff (and table) should be made aware of this at the appropriate time.Meier, Myka. \\"How to Deal with an Over-Spender Who always Wants to Split the Bill.\\" The New York Observer, Nov 07 2017, ProQuest. Web. 30 Apr. 2018 The former being the case typically does not mean that the most expensive item on the menu should be sought out. The dress code for a business related dining event can vary, usually around when the event takes place. The lunch period will likely find participants wearing what they wore to work, though special events may require a higher level of dress. It is important to understand and attempt to match the formality of the event \\\\- this type of table manners begin prior to sitting down at the table.  Restaurant  The level of formality can vary depending on the formality of the restaurant. Proper table manners ought to begin as soon as one arrives at a table. The very first step after sitting down is place the napkin in one's lap. If the napkin is cloth, it should not be entirely unfolded and one crease should be left in placing it on the lap. With the napkin placed on the lap, it protects clothing from spills or food that may fall into the diner's lap. The basic place setting It is important to be able to navigate the table setting, not only knowing which utensils to use, but which items are meant for whose use. A general rule of thumb for selecting the proper spoon or fork when provided with multiple is to start on the outside and work your way in. For example, if you are starting with a salad course and you have two forks to choose from, the fork farthest from the plate should be used, leaving the closer one for the main course. Similarly, if you start with soup, select the spoon that is farthest from the plate. Many restaurants set the table with a bread plate and water glass at each seat before patrons arrive. The bread plate goes to the left of the plate, and the beverage to the right. To avoid drinking from the wrong glass or taking a bite of your neighbor's bread, use the following trick if you forget which is yours: > Touch both your index fingers to your thumbs. On your left, you will see a > lowercase b, which stands for the bread plate. On your right is a lowercase > d for Drinks. Dining in North America is widely viewed as a social occasion, rather than simply an opportunity to eat. As such, it is important to show the people dining with you that you respect them and their time enough to put your cell phone away. According to a study done by the Pew Research Center, 38% percent of people think it is acceptable to use cell phones in restaurants, and that number gets even smaller depending on the occasion. 12% of people think it is OK to use cell phones at family dinners, and only 5% think it is appropriate during meetings. When it comes to paying the bill in American restaurants, adding a tip is a common custom that is often expected by the waiter. According to a study by CreditCards.com, 4 out of 5 Americans always leave a tip when dining out, and the average tip is 16%-20% of the total bill.

Soon the family moved to Kazan where she attended the Jungwald boarding school for girls and later the city gymnasium. After her first marriage to Vasily Tyufyayev (a teacher at the Kazan institute for the Daughters of nobility) broke down, she moved to Saint Petersburg and in 1860 became close to a local circle of the Kazan community. She became romantically involved with Valery Jacobi, later a renowned painter, and for the next decade remained his common-law wife. Their marriage has never been registered, but she adopted Jacobi as her pen name and continued to use it long after the two parted. Aleksandra Jacobi became and active member of the proto-Socialist 1860s movement in Russia and as one of this country's first feminists. In 1866, along with her husband she came to Italy and settled in Rome. A year later, she joined the Garibaldi forces as a sister of mercy and worked for a while as a Russian correspondent for Golos, reporting from the frontlines. Arthur Benni, whom she attended to in hospital during the last days of his life, died in December 1867, apparently in her arms. Several colourful biographies dealt with her seemingly extraordinary adventures in Italy, but later it transpired (from her own diaries and notes) that much of Jacobi's life of that period has been heavily romanticised and to some extent mythologised. The Family of an Artist, the 1867 painting by Valery Jacobi, with Alexandra and their son Vladimir modelling Upon her return from Italy Jacobi continued a successful career in journalism and became a regular contributor to Molva, Birzhevye Vedomosti, Nedelya and Novoye Vremya. She wrote memoirs on Garibaldi (as well as Franz Liszt and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among many others), translated numerous George Sand's fairytales into Russian and was the first translator of the poetry by Mikhail Lermontov and Nikolai Nekrasov into Italian.Alexandra Jacobi's profile at the Online Dostoyevsky encyclopedia / www.fedordostoevsky.ru Jacobi was best known in Russia as a publisher and editor of the children's magazine Igrushechka (–ò–≥—Ä—É—à–µ—á–∫–∞, Little Toy, 1887-1910) which attracted a host of celebrities, among them Lev Tolstoy and Mamin-Sibiryak, as well as Nikolai Leskov, with whom Jacobi corresponded for many years. Although an active contributor, Leskov left some scathing remarks (albeit in private correspondence only) concerning this publication, once calling it \\"...stale old-fashion garbage, proved to be totally irrelevant... and full of hypocrisy.\\"Leskov's 1894 letter to Sergey Shubinsky // –î–∏–Ω–µ—Ä—à—Ç–µ–π–Ω –ï. –ê. ¬´–§–∞–±—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Ç¬ª —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –ê. –§. –ú–∞—Ä–∫—Å. // –ú.: –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞, 1986. ‚Äî –°—Ç—Ä. 47‚Äî48, 135. Maxim Gorky and Kornei Chukovsky were also among the detractors, but Anatoly Kony, a renowned Russian lawyer of the time, praised Igrushechka for good language, high quality translations and brilliant biographical pieces (on Alfred Tennison, Robert Fulton, George Stephenson, James Watt, Carl Linnaeus and Niccol√≤ Paganini among many others), praising it for being a fine source of knowledge for the young readership, filled with the spirit of love, humanism and enlightenment.

Archived from the original on 21. December 2015 at archive.is Life In 1880 Georg Sauter began training as a house painter and then worked in Munich with a painter master. Later he took drawing lessons. He studied painting from October 1884 in the antic class of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.\\"00056 Georg Sauter\\", Matrikelbuch 1884‚Äì1920, Academy of Fine Arts, Munich There he was a pupil of the landscape painter Ludwig von L√∂fftz (1845-1910) and received also suggestions by the portrait painter Franz von Lenbach (1836-1904). Georg Sauter undertook study trips to Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, then lived in London from 1889 as a painter and lithographer, where he married in 1894 Lilian Galsworthy (1864‚Äì1924), the sister of the English novelist John Galsworthy. Sauter entered a circle of artists that included the painters Hubert Herkomer, John Lavery and George Frederick Watts, the author Joseph Conrad and the poet John Masefield. He also met the American painters Joseph Pennell and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, both of whom became close friends. His works show the influence of James Whistler. His painting \\"The Bridal Morning\\", issued in 1909, won second prize in the Carnegie Art Institute's annual exhibition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but became the cause of a scandal over its erotic mood. With the beginning of World War I Sauter was, despite married to an Englishwoman, interned as an enemy alien in 1916 at Alexandra Palace and later expelled. First he went to Jena. Here he had support from the families of glass industrialist Otto Schott and his son-in-law Heinrich Gerland, lawyer and professor at the University of Jena. The friendship with the Gerlands arose in 1906, when Gerland, accompanied by his wife Eva, made a study trip to England and met the artist there. Sauter produced a series of portraits for the Schott family. At the recommendation of Gerland, Sauter created a series of 30 professorial portraits for the University of Jena between 1922 and 1923, which he executed as charcoal drawings. For his work Georg Sauter was appointed honorary citizen of the University of Jena in 1936. Sauter had his residence in Rome at the beginning of the 1930s. During a stay in Cologne in 1930/31 Sauter portrayed the mayor of Cologne Konrad Adenauer and his second wife Gussi. Adenauer then recommended him to other acquaintances, including the industrialist Carl Duisberg: \\"He draws heads of men who interest him and combines these drawings into a collection.\\". Back in Germany, Sauter settled in 1933 in the artists' colony Brannenburg. In 1898 Sauter was one of the founders and member of council of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. He was also a corresponding member of the Vienna Secession and the Soci√©t√© Royale des Beaux Arts in Brussels\\"Sauter, Prof. George.\\" in \\"Who Was Who ?\\" ‚Äì (Oxford Index) and a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund (Association of German Artists). The Leeds Picture, 1908 Georg Sauter was secondly married to Valda Broad (died Dec. 1937) since 1926. The son Rudolf Sauter (1895-1971) was also a portrait painter, draftsman and graphic artist. Among other things, he illustrated the works of his uncle John Galsworthy.

Valentina Murabito (born 28 September 1981 in Giarre, Italy) is an Italian photographer and visual artist. Her photographic works are a hybrid between different art forms merging in experimental analog photography.  Early life and education Valentina Murabito was born in Sicily. From 2004 to 2009, she studied graphic arts at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Catania where she studied graphics software, as well as xylography, lithography and photography. In 2008, she won two scholarships to study photography at the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest. During this time, she created her series \\"Melank√≥likus\\", which unites video art, photography and video documentary. She graduated with honors. In 2009, Murabito moved to Germany and currently lives in Berlin.  Artistry  In her pictures, Murabito creates \\"in-between-creatures\\" that do not fit into any determined category, hybrids between man and woman, human and animal. She plays with gender roles and questions the term of identity. She experiments with analog photography, for instance, by dissolving the photographic surface in order to mold it like a skin or break it like dry earth. The artist develops her photographic work manually on baryte paper, watercolor paper, wood, steel, concrete and walls. Her works open up a dialogue with painting and sculpture.https://www.ingoseufert.com/ausstellungen/valentina-murabirto-a- dream-within-a-dream/ Murabito‚Äôs aesthetic references the research of photography pioneers like Eadweard Muybridge. Her works try to surpass the boundaries of photography by questioning their relationship to reality. Like R. Hanselle wrote in fotoMagazin, they are ‚Äúenchantment and transcendence.‚Äù  Exhibitions and collections  Murabito‚Äôs works are displayed at the SpallArt collection in Salzburg, Austria and other international private collections. Her works were exhibited throughout Europe by the Klosterneuburg Monastery, Delizia Estense del Verginese, the Hungarian Academy Rome and the Municipal Museum Rosenheim.

The laws and regulations that governed postal communication varied widely, depending on which group an individual belonged to, as well as where the individual was located. Postal communication in the ghettos and concentration camps were especially varied, with many locations having regulations unique to them. Despite postal service being available to all individuals in principle, in practice the ability to send and receive mail was at times either interrupted or totally stopped.  Mail service for Non-German civilians  Non-Germans, which included ethnic Poles and anyone else considered to be not racially German by the Nazis, saw no restrictions to their postal communications until 1942, at which time several restrictions were introduced. General Governor Hans Frank issued the following restrictions regarding written communications: non-Germans were limited to a maximum of two letters per month, each letter was limited to a maximum of two pages in length (this restriction was not applied to postcards), and communication were only permitted with friendly countries, though in some cases communication with the outside world was available via neutral countries.Davies 2008, page 76 In addition to these restrictions, an additional regulation was introduced requiring the full name and address of the sender to appear on all pages of the letter to assist with Nazi censorship efforts.  Deutsche Post Osten  DPO was a German postal service in part of German occupied Poland known as Generalgouvernement. The Post took over assets of Poczta Polska, Telegraf i Telefon in 1939. The Post employed Germans, Volksdeutsche and Poles. The post used at the beginning both Polish and German stamps with Deutsche Post Osten and Generalgouvernement overprints, later its own stamps. Its president was Richard Lauxmann. The Deutsche Post Osten serviced ghettos in GG till 1941. Later Judenrats took over the service. The DPO has published Official Phone Book for General Government.  Ghettos  In the ghettos established by Nazi occupying forces after the invasion of Poland, the duty of setting up a ghetto post office and mail service often fell to the local Judenrat. The administration of the ghettos varied from ghetto to ghetto across the General Government, and so did the availability of mail service within them. While most ghettos did have some postal service, some did not for unknown reasons. In many ghettos the transfer from a local mail service to one provided by the Judenrat was not immediate. As many cities occupied by the Nazis began to refuse to provide mail service to Jews, the transfer to a systematic process within the ghetto was a gradual process. The post offices established in the ghettos also provided a source of employment for the Jews living within. In ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (annected to Reich) the post office employed 139 Jews by December 1940, and in the Warsaw ghetto the two post offices established employed 94 Jews by January 1941.Trunk 1996, page 178-179 In the Warsaw ghetto, an agreement regarding the exchange of mail leaving and entering the ghetto was reached and was then applied to all ghettos within the General Government.Trunk 1996, page 179 Adam Czerniakow, the head of the Warsaw Judenrat, and the director of Post Office No. C-I, agreed that the Judenrat would handle all mail within the ghetto (coming in to and leaving) and that the Germans would establish a special post office (Postaustauschstelle) for use in exchanging letters and parcels further on. The post offices in the ghettos also provided a source of income for the local Judenrat, as these councils were also responsible for other public services within the ghetto. This however was often a point of conflict in the ghettos, as the cost of postage often saw a surcharge raising its price to near double the rate outside the ghettos. The ghettos, and along with them the mail service within, were often subject to the whims of the German occupiers. As German resettlement and deportation plans intensified following the invasion of the Soviet Union, so too did disruptions and in some places suspensions of the mail service.Trunk 1996, page 180Simon 1973, page 3 Stoppages in post also corresponded with intensification of Nazi ideology. For example, in Krakow, the exchange of parcels to and from Jews was suspended for sanitation reasons.  Concentration camps  Postal communication, while subject to many regulations, was allowed to inmates in the concentration camps. The regulations placed upon those living in the concentration camps were outlined by Theodor Eicke during his time as the commandant of the Dachau concentration camp.Moscato 1996, page 71 Prisoners were only able to write letters on pre- provided postcards within the camps and were forbidden from writing outside the lines of the postcard. Additionally, inmates had to provide their full name, date of birth, and location within the camp in the address. Beyond their given names, inmates were required to identify themselves as Jewish by adding Israel to their name for males, and Sara for females. In addition to these explicit regulations, prisoners were also often obliged to include the line ‚ÄúI am in good health and everything is fine here‚Äù in their postcards.Moscato 1996, page 72 For both the senders and responders to these letters, the only acceptable written language was German. After sending, any letters would be subject to strict censorship by both the camp post office, and the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW). Printed on all pre-provided postcards were additional rules regarding the frequency with which letters could be exchanged, as well as what was allowed to be sent along with the letter.Moscati 1996, page 16 These additional rules and regulations are known as Eicke's Regulation and applied to prisoners in all concentration camps. While these regulations would have been intended for use across all camps, their application and enforcement was up to the local SS officials, and as a result were not always implemented uniformly. = Text of Section VII of Eicke's Regulation = #During the month every person interned is allowed to receive or send two letters or two postcards from/to relatives. Letters addressed to prisoners are to be legible and written in ink with fifteen lines per page. They are to be of normal size. The envelopes are to have an inside lining and not more than five 12 Pfg. stamps are to be enclosed. Everything else is forbidden and subject to confiscation. Only ten lines are allowed for postcards. Photographs are not to be sent as postcards. #Money is not allowed to be sent. #It is to be kept in mind that for dispatching money as well as normal correspondence it is necessary to indicate‚Ä¶ name, date of birth and matriculation number of the prisoner. If this data is not clear the post office will see to the return to the sender or to the destruction of the correspondence. #Newspapers are allowed but they can only be reserved at the camp post office. #Dispatching of parcels is not allowed inasmuch as the interned is able to buy everything needed in the camp. #Requests to the security authority of the camp for release are useless. #Permissions to talk to or visit prisoners in the camp are absolutely forbidden.

Vasiura's wartime activities were not fully revealed until the mid-1980s, when he was convicted as a war criminal by a Soviet military court and executed in 1987 for his role in the Khatyn massacre. Biography =Early life and Soviet military= Hryhoriy Vasiura was born on February 9, 1915, (according to other data, in 1913) in the city of Chyhyryn (now Cherkasy Region, Ukraine). He worked as a school teacher before World War II. In 1936, he graduated from the Kiev Military School of Communications. By the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Vasiura commanded a communication squad of the 67th Rifle Division (according to data of his war prisoner card, he served in the artillery forces). During the battle of LiepƒÅja on June 28, he was wounded in the thigh and captured. Vasiura was imprisoned in the camp Stalag III-A.

The unit had a double leadership: German Major Erich K√∂rner was in charge, while Vasiura supervised the battalion on a daily basis. That same month, the unit was transferred to the occupied Belorussian SSR to conduct punitive operations against partisans. The battalion first arrived at Minsk, and then deployed to the town of Pleshchenitsy. From January 1943 to July 1944, Vasiura and his battalion conducted dozens of pacification actions ‚Äì including operations Hornung, Draufg√§nger, Cottbus, Hermann and Wandsbeck ‚Äì that were part of the \\"dead zone\\" policy of annihilating hundreds of Belarusian villages in order to remove the support base for the alleged partisans. 60 major and 80 smaller actions affected 627 villages across occupied Belarus. =Khatyn massacre= On the morning of March 22, 1943, three vehicles with the 118th battalion staff were ambushed by \\"Uncle Vasya's\\" partisan squad near the village of Khatyn. Partisans killed Hans Woellke, the hauptmann (captain) of the auxiliary police and commander of the first battalion's company, who was on his way to the Minsk airport. He was well known as the shot-put champion of the 1936 Olympics. Hitler knew him personally. Woellke's death enraged the policemen, who suspected local peasants of helping the partisans. On the Pleshchenitsy‚ÄìLogoysk road they stopped 50 inhabitants of the village of Kozyri, and killed 26 of them. Soon the 118th battalion and SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger surrounded the village of Khatyn. Following K√∂rner's orders, the soldiers under Vasiura's direction forced the peasants into a barn which they set on fire. They shot everybody who tried to escape. In total, 149 people died (including 75 children). =Later war crimes in Belarus= Vasiura continued serving in the 118th battalion in Belarus. On May 13, 1943, he commanded a unit in a battle against partisans for the village of Dalkovichi, and on May 27, his battalion executed 78 people in the village of Osovi. Then, within the punitive operation Cottbus, the unit massacred residents of the village of Vileika and its suburbs. Afterwards they burned the villages of Makovie and Uborok, where nobody was left alive, and then executed 50 Jews in the village of Kaminska Sloboda. Vasiura later transferred to the 76th Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the 30th Grenadier SS-Division, where he fought until the end of the war. Supposedly, his regiment was smashed in France, where some part of the 118th Schutzmannschaft battalion went over to French partisans. K√∂rner hid the civilian deaths, reporting to his superiors that the 118th battalion fought only against numerous partisan squads. This was due to the decree, issued on November 18, 1942, that forbade involving locals in criminal liability because many villages were \\"under partisans' oppression\\". =Post-war times= A photo of Hryhoriy Vasiura from his criminal case, 1985 While at the Soviet filtration camp, Vasiura hid the fact of his service in the auxiliary police and SS. In 1952, the Kiev Military Tribunal sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment but on September 17, 1955, he was amnestied in accordance with a decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Usually, Vasiura explained his post-war imprisonment by the fact that he had previously been taken prisoner by the Germans, and obtained an official certificate confirming this. Vasiura moved to the village Velyka Dymerka (Brovary District, Kyiv Region) and became the economic director of the Velikodymersky state farm. The farm was quite successful under his leadership. However, farm-workers sometimes complained about Vasiura's heavy-handed management as he would cruelly beat the employees. He built a big house, was encouraged several times for conscientious work, and received a membership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In 1984, he was awarded the medal Veteran of Labour. He married, and two of his daughters were school teachers. Vasiuta became an honorary cadet of the Kiev Military School of Communications. He would give patriotic speeches in front of cadets and pioneers, making reference to his fictional battle feats, pretending that he was a Red Army veteran. =Detention and trial= In 1985, Vasiura demanded the Order of the Patriotic War as a veteran. In the archives, employees found only the fact that he went missing in June 1941. Further searches in the archives forced them to review some results of the interrogation of Vasyl Meleshko, Vasiura's former fellow soldier, who was executed in 1975 for collaboration with the Nazis and participation in the burning of Khatyn. A criminal case was opened \\"due to the newly discovered circumstances\\". In November 1986, Vasiura was arrested and transferred to Minsk. With almost no survivors of the Khatyn massacre, the 26 witnesses were former soldiers of the 118th Schutzmannschaft battalion, most of whom had already served their sentences in Soviet camps and prisons. The death sentence to Hryhoriy Vasiura handed down by the Tribunal of the Belorussian Military District on December 26, 1986. Vasiura initially denied his guilt; he claimed that he did not participate in the punitive operation and did not kill any civilians. But the witnesses all testified that Vasiura gave them orders to kill the villagers. Transcripts of the court case totaled 14 volumes, and the investigators managed to reconstruct the events of March 22, 1943, with accuracy to the minute. Irrefutable evidence of his participation in these military crimes, particularly in the episode at Khatyn, was found. When Vasiura realized that there was no point denying it, he confessed, shouting, \\"Yes, I burned your Khatyn!\\" On December 26, 1986, the Tribunal of the Belorussian Military District, headed by Judge Viktor Glazkov, sentenced Vasiura to death by shooting. He was executed on October 2, 1987. The trial was not public; only two correspondents ‚Äì of the newspaper Izvestiya and the agency BelTA ‚Äì were assigned to report on it. They completed their articles but were later informed that the materials would not be published. Glazkov claimed that this happened due to the direct involvement of the general secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, and the Belorussian Communist Party First Secretary Mikalai Sliunkov. Both were concerned that a public trial of a Ukrainian war criminal would undermine the official discourse of the brotherhood between Soviet peoples. Vasiura was buried in a forest near Logoysk, in the same place where many of his victims lay. There are papers in the archives which contain the coordinates of the place where his body was buried. He has no grave marker. The Belarusian government declassified the records of the trial in March 2008.

Holsinger (March 13, 1937 ‚Äì September 4, 2009) was a food scientist who played an important part in the dairy industry. She helped to develop Lactaid and Beano. Biography Holsinger was born in Washington D.C. on March 13, 1937. In 1958, she graduated from the College of William and Mary with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Afterwards, she joined the Agricultural Research Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She later went to Ohio State University in 1980 where she got her doctorate in food science. Major contributions Throughout her life, she specialized in dairy products. During the 1980s, she was approached by a family dairy farm to create a milk substitute for individuals who were lactose intolerant. This opportunity led to the formation of the Lactaid brand. After the success of Lactaid, the U.S. military approached Holsinger about creating a product designed for soldiers who were lactose intolerant, with the additional requirement that the product be made from dehydrated milk powder. Holsinger worked with the team that helped her develop Lactaid and successfully developed a lactose free dehydrated milk powder that not only had a long shelf life but tasted good as well. Virginia Holsinger's research was put to use by Alan Kligerman and he developed Beano. Her work and research was also used to develop reduced-fat mozzarella cheese and formulated food for emergencies as part of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Food for Peace program. Holsinger retired in 1999 as the leader of the Dairy Products Research Unit in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. Later the next year, she was inducted into the ARS Hall of Fame for all her research.

It was founded in 1847, and it was named after the Greek national benefactor Constantinos Ionides, father of Alexander Constantine Ionides. History Ionideios was established in 1847. However, its history began in 1844, when the Mayor of Piraeus was Petros Omiridis Skylitsis, who addressed to Konstantinos Ionidis by letter he asked for help in setting up schools in Piraeus. In his reply to the mayor, Constantinos Ionides stated that he would provide 30,000 drachmas, an amount of great importance at the time, provided that the Municipality of Piraeus would purchase the land pay for the future cost of the school in order to function. In 1845 the City Council accepted these terms together with some others that the donor had set. Two years later, in 1847 and on the mayoralty of Dimitrios Theocharis, the construction of the school began and on 21 May of the same year while the donor provided 10,000 drachmas more for the needs of the school and the creation of a library. In 1862, the establishment of the Gymnasium was signed by the then Minister of Education. Until 1914 the school housed the only Gymnasium in Piraeus. This year, with the foundation of the Second Gymnasium in the city of Piraeus, Ionides renamed the school to First Gymnasium. The Gymnasium operated in the original building of 1847 until 1932, when it was demolished, in order to erect in its place the building in which it is housed today. In 1963, the Minister of Education, Grigorios Kasimatis renames the school to Ionideios Model School of Piraeu. Since 1986 the official name is set to be \\"Experimental Gymnasium and Lyceum of Ionideios\\" and it is usually referred to as \\"Ionideios High School of Piraeus\\".http://lyk-peir- ionid.att.sch.gr/istoria.htmlhttps://www.esos.gr/arthra/54790/ionideios-sholi- peiraia-170-hronia-istorias-kai-prosforas-stin-elliniki-paideia Enrollment Every year the Greek ministry of education organises exams for the 17 model schools of Greece.https://www.minedu.gov.gr/publications/docs2014/140403_pps_perf.pdfhttp://www.tovima.gr/files/1/2013/19/peir.pdf The students apply for one of the 17 schools.

The pathogen was previously classified as P. drechsleri Dre II before being categorized as its own distinct species . P. hydropathica has been primarily found in association with ornamental plant nurseries. The pathogen has been isolated throughout the Southern United States, as well as internationally in Mexico, Italy, and Spain. Etymology The species name hydropathica is composed of the word elements hydro, meaning \\"water\\" and pathica, referring to the pathogenicity. Hosts and symptoms P. hydropathica has been shown to naturally infect a number of different plants including Catawba rhododendron, English Roseum rhododendron, mountain laurel, and Laurustinus trees. Studies have shown that the pathogen has the ability to infect other hosts when introduced, such as alder, carnations, cucumber, azaleas, dusty miller, tomato, and pepper. Symptoms of infection vary with host type. =Natural hosts= * Catawba rhododendron (Rhododendron catawbiense): necrosis of the leaf and shoot tip blight. * English Roseum rhododendron (Rhododendron sp. 'English Roseum'): leaf lesions. * Mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia): wilting, discoloration, and lesions of stem, shoot blight. * Mountain laurel (Kalmia japonica): stem wilt. * Laurustinus trees (Viburnum tinus): wilting and shoot lesions. =Additional hosts= * Alder (Alnus glutinosa): stem necrosis and foliar lesions on leaves. Symptoms only appear on wounded tissue. * Carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus): petal infection. Symptoms appear on wounded tissue. * Cucumber (Cucumis sativus cv. Orient Express): damping off of seedlings. * Azaleas (Rhodoendron Kurume hybrid cv. Hershey's Red): root rot. * Dusty miller (Senecio bicolor subsp. cineraria cv. Silver Dust): root infection. * Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Homestead): root infection, and fruit rot of wounded fruit. * Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Horis): necrosis of leaves. Symptoms appear on wounded tissue. * Pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. California Wonder): root infection, and fruit rot of wounded fruit. Necrosis of leaves appear on wounded tissue. Disease cycle P. hydropathica is a heterothallic oomycete, meaning that both mating types need to be present in order to sexually reproduce . The A1 mating type has been reported to be highly represented in populations . The species produce plerotic oospores and round antheridia, with observations of the sexual bodies being golden in color . Nonpapillate and noncaducous sporangia are produced, with varying shapes (obpyriform, ovoid, and nearly spherical), and are able to release zoospores. Zoospore release time has been recorded to vary, from release happening immediately after sporangia formation or within hours. Some isolates do not show the ability to produce zoospores. P. hydropathica does produce chlamydospores, present at the end of long hyphae and on short pedicels. Hyphal swelling has also been observed. Environment P. hydropathica is most commonly found in sources of water, such as reserve water ponds, irrigation systems, and rivers. The optimal temperature for growth in the lab is . In irrigation reservoirs in Mississippi and Alabama the pathogen has the highest counts in the month of May, and has also been shown to have high recovery rates in hot summer temperatures. In the U.S. isolates have been recovered in Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Samples have also been isolated in Italy,, Spain, and Mexico.

He co-founded the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, and conducted early research with physiologist Michael Foster. A. G. Dew-Smith was born in Salisbury, England to Charles Dew. He took the name Dew-Smith after inheriting substantial property in 1870. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, earning a B.A. (1873) and M.A. (1876). He was an early student of Michael Foster, and conducted research on electrical stimulation of mollusc and frog hearts in the 1870s, making three working visits to the Naples Zoological Station. A man of independent wealth, he financed the founding of The Journal of Physiology, of which Foster was the first editor. He was also a founding member of The Physiological Society. In 1878 Dew-Smith left scientific research, later launching the Cambridge Engraving Company, and establishing the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company with Horace Darwin. In 1884 he was elected a member of the Photographic Society of Great Britain. He was also a fellow and life member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. In 1895 he married Alice Lloyd, a New Zealand-born author; they had no children. They lived at Chesterton Hall on Chesterton Road, Cambridge. He died at Fulham, London, and is buried in Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge.

The shooter was identified as 38-year-old Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who entered through an exterior parking garage, approached an outdoor patio, and opened fire with a Smith & Wesson 9 mm semi-automatic pistol. Aghdam wounded three people, one of them critically, before killing herself. Shooting At 12:46 p.m., San Bruno police received reports of a shooter at the YouTube headquarters. Aghdam's weapon had a capacity of 10 rounds and she emptied one magazine before reloading. Helicopter footage later showed a large hole and broken glass in the building's lobby doors. A coroner's report found that Aghdam died of a self-inflicted gunshot to the heart, finding no evidence of drugs or alcohol in her system.  Perpetrator  =Background= The perpetrator was identified by police as Nasim Najafi Aghdam (; 5 April 1979 ‚Äì 3 April 2018), a vegan activist and aspiring fitness personality. She was born in Urmia, Iran, and immigrated to the United States with her family in 1996. She was a registered member of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and described how veganism was aligned with her religion, but was critical of Middle Eastern cultural practices and Muslims and Bah√° º√≠s who ate animals. She lived with her grandmother in Riverside County, California. She posted content on Facebook, Instagram, Telegram and YouTube in Persian, Azerbaijani, English and Turkish. Her content went viral on Iranian social media and drew widespread attention. She had previously protested with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against the use of pigs in United States Marine Corps training procedures for victims of trauma. Nasim Aghdam purchased and registered a 9 mm Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol from a San Diego gun dealer on January 16, 2018. On March 31, 2018, Aghdam's family reported to the police that Nasim Aghdam was missing. According to her father, she \\"hated\\" YouTube, and the family was worried she might be traveling to the company's offices. The morning before the shooting, police officers found Aghdam sleeping in her car in a Walmart parking lot in Mountain View, south of YouTube's headquarters. The officers did not identify her as a threat, and it is unclear whether these police officers were aware of the concerns of Aghdam's father. Aghdam visited a shooting range the day before the shooting. =Motive= Police believe Aghdam was motivated by perceived discrimination by YouTube towards her channels. She complained about the company on her website, writing that \\"Youtube filtered my channels to keep them from getting views!\\" and that the company had demonetized most of her videos. Ismail Aghdam, her father, of Riverside County, said that his daughter was a \\"vegan activist and animal lover\\" who told him that YouTube had been censoring her videos and stopped paying her for her content. ‚ÄúShe was angry,‚Äù he said.Ethan Barron, \\"YouTube Shooter's Father Says She Was Angry at Company,\\" The Mercury News,\\" April 20, 2018 According to the San Jose Mercury-News: > [Nasim] Aghdam was prolific on social media, posting videos and photos on > Instagram, Facebook, YouTube. Her YouTube channel included strange workout > video clips, graphic animal abuse videos and vegan cooking tutorials.  Victims  San Francisco General Hospital and Stanford University Medical Center treated the victims. Four injuries were reported. The victims were a 36-year-old man in critical condition, a 32-year-old woman in fair condition, and a 27-year-old woman in stable condition.

The Terrapins compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Big Ten Conference. The Terrapins joined the Big Ten Conference on July 1, 2014, following 62 years in the Atlantic Coast Conference as a founding member. The Terrapins are currently coached by Mike Locksley. Since 1950, the Terrapins have played their home games at Maryland Stadium in College Park, Maryland with occasional home games from time to time in Baltimore, making them one of two FBS football teams in the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington metropolitan area (Navy Midshipmen) and the closest Football Bowl Subdivision team to Washington, D.C. The team's official colors of red, white, black, and gold have been in use in some combination since the 1920s and are taken from Maryland's state flag, and the Terrapins nickname ‚Äî often abbreviated as \\"Terps\\" ‚Äî was adopted in 1933 after a turtle species native to the state.

They went scoreless in all three of that season's games, but the following year, posted a perfect record of 6‚Äì0. For the first two decades of the program, the team primarily competed against local universities and high schools due to the prohibitive nature of long-distance travel at the time.David Ungrady, Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, p. 4, Sports Publishing LLC, 2003, .

He was Maryland's sixth head coach in eight years, but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school's most successful head coach in modern history.Records (PDF), 2007 Maryland Football Media Guide, University of Maryland, p. 55, 2007. During his tenure, he led Maryland to two national championships (one retroactive), three conference championships, three perfect seasons, six top-20 final rankings, and five bowl game appearances. Seven of his players were named first-team All-Americans, including five consensus All-Americans. Under Tatum, Maryland finished every season with a winning record.

The Terrapins won the 1951 Southern Conference co-championship alongside the Virginia Military Institute. Their perfect season culminated with an upset over first-ranked Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl. At the time, however, the wire services released their final rankings before the bowl games,Vic Gold, The Greatest Game, Washingtonian, January 1, 2002. and Maryland finished third in the Associated Press Poll. Several selectors, including analyst Jeff Sagarin, have retroactively credited Maryland with the national championship.Past Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I FBS) National Champions, National Collegiate Athletic Association, retrieved December 1, 2008. In 1953, Maryland and six other schools split from the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference. That year, Maryland shut-out two 11th-ranked teams: Mississippi, 38‚Äì0, and Alabama, 21‚Äì0, won the ACC co-championship alongside Duke, and were named the national champions as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation. The Terrapins were defeated by fourth-ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. After the 1955 season, Tatum resigned to return to North Carolina, where he soon died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.The Coach, Time, August 3, 1959. Tommy Mont (1956‚Äì1958) After Tatum resigned to coach at his own alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement.Text from Page 54, Reveille, University of Maryland Yearbook, p. 54, 1959, retrieved January 28, 2009.

Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had,K. Adam Powell and Woody Durham, Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, 2004, Scarecrow Press, . but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a highly touted guard prospect.Atlantic Coast Conference, Sports Illustrated, September 23, 1957. Breedlove later went on to play eight years in the NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance. In 1957, the Terrapins improved to a 5‚Äì5 record. The highlight of the season was a game featuring Jim Tatum's return to College Park, Maryland. On October 19, at Byrd Stadium, Maryland met the North Carolina team led by their former head coach. The game also had in attendance Queen Elizabeth II who had expressed a wish to see her first game of American football. The Tar Heels were ranked 6th in the nation and possessed a 3‚Äì1 record. The Terrapins, on the other hand, were 1‚Äì3. In the first quarter, Maryland halfback Howard Dare fumbled and North Carolina linebacker Jack Lineberger recovered the ball on the Terrapins' 44-yard line. North Carolina was subsequently forced to punt, but recovered it at the Maryland 35. On the ensuing possession, Tar Heel halfback Daley Goff rushed 11 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Maryland gained excellent field position when Goff received a bad punt snap and the Terps took over on the Carolina 38-yard line. Maryland quarterback Bob Rusevlyan later scored on a one-yard sneak. In the fourth quarter, halfback Ted Kershner broke away for an 81-yard touchdown run. Fullback Jim Joyce capped a 67-yard drive with a 13-yard rush for a score. With a final result of 21‚Äì7, the Maryland players carried Mont to the Queen and Prince Philip's box.Bob Boyles and Paul Guido, 50 Years of College Football: A Modern History of America's Most Colorful Sport, 2007, Skyhorse Publishing Inc., .

In 1958, however, Maryland again backslided with a 4‚Äì6 record and Mont subsequently resigned. Tom Nugent (1959‚Äì1965) At the first practice before the 1959 season, new Terps head football coach Tom Nugent addressed his team, \\"Hi, I'm Tom Nugent and I hate West Virginia.\\" The Mountaineers were Maryland's first opponent of the season, and Nugent guided the Terrapins to a 27‚Äì7 victory in that game. Roger Staubach of Navy tosses a pass against Maryland, 1964. In 1961, Nugent's Maryland team became the first college football program in the nation to put players' names on the back of their jerseys.Dan Steinberg, When Maryland football first put players names on jerseys, The Washington Post, August 2, 2011. That season, he led the Terrapins to the best season of his tenure and finished with a 7‚Äì3 record.Bill Free, Ex-Terps coach Nugent dies, The Baltimore Sun, January 20, 2006.

He remained the last Maryland coach to win his inaugural game with the team until Ralph Friedgen matched that feat in 2001.Maryland Shocks UNC, The Orlando Sentinel, September 2, 2001. Under Nugent, in 1962, Maryland integrated its football team after Darryl Hill caught the eye of Maryland assistant coach Lee Corso. who had been encouraged by Nugent to find a black athlete to play for his team. Hill became not only the first African-American football player at Maryland but the first in the Atlantic Coast Conference and at any college or university in \\"the old South.\\" Lou Saban (1966) In a surprising move, Lou Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach of the AFL's Buffalo Bills in January 1966 to the head football coach position at Maryland. He said he was leaving because \\"there can be little left to conquer in professional football\\". His record at Buffalo was 36‚Äì17‚Äì3. Saban, however, only stayed at Maryland for one season in which the team posted a 4‚Äì6 record, as he departed back to the AFL to become head coach of the Denver Broncos. Bob Ward (1967‚Äì1968) In 1967, Bob Ward returned to his alma mater to take the head coaching position. Before the season, 12 players failed to academically qualify to play on the team.They Said It, Sports Illustrated, July 17, 1967. During that first season, the team lost all nine of their games for the first time in the modern era. Ward's second year saw slight improvement, recording eight losses but with wins over North Carolina and South Carolina. However, many of his players were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style. In March 1969, Maryland athletic director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one of those players told Ward that they no longer wished to play for the Terrapins and accused him of using intimidation tactics, including verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said: > \\"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who > started it. It was the guys who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, > guys who sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak > cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about ... He gets on > the campus newspaper and all of a sudden he's got power he never thought of > having.\\"Shave Off That Thing!, Sports Illustrated, September 1, 1969, > retrieved January 18, 2009. The Diamondback, the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward for moving the team into one dormitory, which forced some other students out. Ward stated that the move was done on the advice of Kehoe‚Äîwhich Kehoe denied‚Äîand with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie. Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. In fact, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and sent a letter to the American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said: > \\"I don't know who's right or wrong, but ... I don't think it's a good thing > for a squad to fire a coach. As an association, we ought to know what > happened. If a university fired an English professor because his class > didn't like the way he was doing things, I know darn well that the American > Association of University Professors would want to know what happened.\\" Roy Lester (1969‚Äì1971) Coach Lester In 1969, Roy Lester was hired as Maryland's fourth head coach in five years. Lester had previously twice applied for the Maryland head coach position, but didn't get it. The Daytona Beach Morning Journal speculated that Lester's undisclosed salary probably matched that of Ward: $20,000.Lester Named Maryland Grid Coach, The Daytona Beach Morning Journal, March 15, 1969. Lester reintroduced the split-T formation at Maryland,Lester Keeps the Big Ones Penned Up, The Herald-Journal, October 30, 1969. which Jim Tatum had used to great effect there in the 1950s. Lester's philosophy was explained by the Maryland sports information director Jack Zane: \\"the pass should open up the defense for the running game.\\"In the sixth game of his first season, Maryland's starting quarterback, junior Dennis O'Hara, was injured in a loss at South Carolina, and was replaced by sophomore Jeff Shugars.Maryland Way Down, Coach Says, The Pittsburgh Press, November 14, 1969. In the season's penultimate game, Maryland lost to Penn State, 48‚Äì0. Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell had been recruited by Lester and originally intended to go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris, whose high school coach was a friend of Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3‚Äì7 record. In 1970, Lester's Terrapins finished with a 2‚Äì9 record. After an upset loss in the season opener against Villanova, 21‚Äì3, Lester shuffled the roster. He switched the positions of eight players, which included Tom Miller from fullback to linebacker.The season prior, Miller had gained 629 yards, the second-most ever by a Maryland sophomore.8 Players Switched By Lester, The Herald-Journal, September 16, 1970. After losing their first five games, Maryland beat South Carolina on Homecoming weekend, 21‚Äì15, which prompted Maryland fans to tear down the goalposts in celebration. In the 25-mile per hour winds, the Terrapins capitalized on the Gamecocks' poor punting game, which included one blocked punt.On Loss To Maryland; Leheup: They Deserved It, The Herald-Journal, October 18, 1970. Two weeks later, Maryland was beaten by Clemson, which scored 21 points in the fourth quarter to win, 24‚Äì11.Low-Ebb Lester: It's Not Kids' Fault But Mine, The Herald- Journal, November 1, 1970. With the loss, Maryland slid to a 1‚Äì7 record, and Lester said he was giving serious consideration to stepping down before the next season. He said, \\"If I'm not doing the proper job I'm willing to relinquish the job. I took this loss very personally.\\" In 1971, some observers considered Maryland, which returned 37 lettermen, to be the dark horse in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).No Way To Explain Losses, The Star-News, September 13, 1971. Lester said he expected a winning season and that \\"a lot of people may be surprised.\\"Terp Coach Expecting Big Season, The Schenectady Gazette, September 8, 1971. However, the Terrapins dropped the season opener to underdog Villanova once again, 28‚Äì13.Star-News called it the most stunning of five upsets in the ACC teams' opening weekend, rating it ahead of NC State's loss to Kent State, Virginia's loss to Navy, South Carolina's win against Georgia Tech, and Duke's win against Florida.Maryland won the following week against NC State, but then dropped five straight before beating the Virginia Military Institute on Homecoming. Maryland closed the season with losses to Penn State, Clemson, and Virginia to again finish with a 2‚Äì9 record.Lester was fired at the conclusion of the 1971 season. Athletic director Jim Kehoe cited Maryland's worst record in the ACC for two consecutive years and stated his goal of making Maryland a \\"nationally ranked caliber\\" team.Maryland Fires Head Grid Coach, The Tuscaloosa News, December 5, 1971. Kehoe also said, \\"financial factors are a serious consideration\\", and that home game attendance had fallen to its lowest point, which threatened the financial well-being of the athletic department. Lester was replaced by Jerry Claiborne,Claiborne Wants To Forget Past, Reading Eagle, December 17, 1971. who later went on to considerable success in the position. In September 1973, Maryland All-American guard Paul Vellano, then playing under Claiborne, said of the past coaches' difficulties: \\"A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach but that he had a lot of bad apples. Lester was a high school coach and nobody had ever heard of him. I can't understand it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans my first year here under Lester. Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job.Terps' Vellano Wants Bowl Bid, The Herald- Journal, September 5, 1973. One of Lester's lasting contributions was the recruitment of future Maryland and NFL star Randy White.Pine Has Rich Grid Background, The Gardsen Times, October 25, 1981. At the end of his tenure, Lester had a combined collegiate coaching record of 7‚Äì25.Roy Lester, College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved February 9, 2009. Jerry Claiborne (1972‚Äì1981) Jerry Claiborne engineered a turnaround of Maryland's fortunes beginning in 1972. In 1972, Jerry Claiborne took over as head coach of the Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland improved to 5‚Äì5‚Äì1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11‚Äì0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as \\"vanilla\\", and said his strategy was \\"run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense.\\" He went on to say, \\"But, there's no question he made me a tougher player . . . We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player.\\"David Ungrady, p. 210. In 1974, Maryland had a preseason rank of 14th and later beat 17th-ranked NC State to win the ACC championship. The Terrapins were defeated by 20th-ranked Tennessee in the Liberty Bowl and finished the season ranked 13th. In 1975, Maryland again won the ACC and defeated 13th-ranked Florida in the Gator Bowl to finish 13th in the nation. That season, the Terrapins led the ACC in total offense with 375.2 yards per game.ACC Year-by-Year (PDF), 2007 Atlantic Coast Conference Media Guide, Atlantic Coast Conference, 2007. Maryland started 1976 ranked 12th, and quarterback Mark Manges led them to eleven consecutive wins to secure their third straight ACC championship. Maryland's loss to sixth-ranked Houston in the Cotton Bowl Classic, 30‚Äì21, ended any hopes for a national championship.Cotton Bowl Foes Arrive, The New York Times, December 27, 1976. In 1978, Maryland beat 20th-ranked NC State and finished with a ranking of 20th. The game that pitted 11th-ranked Maryland against 12th-ranked Clemson has been described as one of the most exciting games of the era. The \\"big-play caravan\\" ultimately saw Clemson triumph, 28‚Äì24.Bob Boyles and Paul Guido, The USA Today College Football Encyclopedia: A Comprehensive Modern Reference to America's Most Colorful Sport, 1953‚Äìpresent, p. 356, New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2008, From 1974 to 1978, Claiborne and the Terrapins secured five consecutive bowl game berths and three consecutive ACC championships. Maryland made it to a sixth bowl game in 1980. After the 1981 season, Claiborne left the program for his alma mater, Kentucky,Herbert Sparrow, Claiborne seeks return to Kentucky glory days, The Free-Lance Star, December 17, 1981. and was replaced by Bobby Ross, an assistant coach for the Kansas City Chiefs. Bobby Ross (1982‚Äì1986) Coach Ross In a surprising choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, who was not a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high- powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes.Justin Rodriguez, Champion of the underdog, Times Herald-Record, August 8, 2004. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, \\"Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve . . . If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't know if I would have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL.\\" In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed \\"Quarterback U\\" as a result.Quarterback U , Sports Illustrated, November 25, 1991.Ken Murray, Ex-Maryland Qbs Not A Passing Fancy, The Seattle Times, January 9, 1993. In Ross's inaugural season, Maryland defeated 10th-ranked North Carolina, and then edged Miami before their most important conference game of the season against the 1981 national champions, the Clemson Tigers. Between 1974 and 1988, either Clemson or Maryland won the ACC title all but three years. Clemson had lost to the 1980 national champions, seventh-ranked Georgia, 13‚Äì7, and tied Boston College, 17‚Äì17, after the opposing quarterback, Doug Flutie, led a comeback. Clemson was therefore unable to defend their NCAA championship, but either Clemson or Maryland, with perfect conference records, would secure the ACC title. Thus, decades before the official ACC Championship Game, 1982 saw a rare de facto title match. Clemson scored first, then pulled away 14‚Äì7 before half. In the second half, a favorable wind twice yielded Maryland excellent field position, Esiason threw for two rapid-fire touchdowns and a two-point conversion, and the defense held Clemson at bay. However, the Terrapins also turned the ball over five times in the second half and lost, 24‚Äì22.Jim Sumner, Looking Back... The 1982 Clemson at Maryland Game: A Game Worthy of Championship Status , Atlantic Coast Conference, October 24, 2007. With the win, Clemson won the ACC and Maryland finished second. Immediately after the game, the NCAA announced its investigation into Clemson recruiting had found improprieties. As a result, the Tigers were denied a bowl game and television coverage in the following season.

Joe Krivak (1987‚Äì1991) Maryland athletics in general were marred by the death of Len Bias, and the football team was no exception. After Ross resigned, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Joe Krivak was promoted to head coach. This was the beginning of a lackluster period for Terrapins football. From 1987 to 2000, the Terrapins went 55‚Äì88 overall (.385) with only two winning seasons and one bowl appearance. The Krivak era was met with a brutal schedule with non- conference opponents consisting of national powers Michigan, Miami, Penn State, and Syracuse among others.

Randy Edsall (2011‚Äì2015) Coach Edsall After Friedgen was let go, the Terrapins hired Randy Edsall away from Connecticut to be Maryland's head coach. The 2011 season was not a successful one for Maryland. After a nationally televised win over Miami, the Terrapins struggled for the remainder of the season. They only managed to record one more win (against FCS opponent Towson) and finished with a 2‚Äì10 record. The team did attract national attention for its \\"Maryland Pride\\" uniforms that were created by Under Armour, who had become the official outfitter of the Maryland Athletic Department in September 2008. After the 2011 season, Edsall fired both his offensive coordinator Gary Crowton and his defensive coordinator Todd Bradford. Mike Locksley, who had been fired in 2011 from his head coaching position at New Mexico, was hired to be the new offensive coordinator. Locksley had previously worked at Maryland under head coaches Vanderlinden and Friedgen, and was the recruiting coordinator for Maryland before and during the three consecutive 10+ win seasons under Friedgen. Brian Stewart, who had been the defensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars, was hired to replace Bradford as the new defensive coordinator. Edsall's 2012 team compiled a 4‚Äì8 record, losing four quarterbacks to injury, and eventually starting a linebacker at the position. The team's record improved from 2011 nonetheless but still not as much as fans, alumni and the administration had hoped.

Following the practice-related death of player Jordan McNair, Durkin was placed on leave in August 2018. Matt Canada was named acting head coach until further notice. The University System of Maryland Board of Regents reinstated Durkin on October 30, 2018, causing protests and uproar. University of Maryland President Wallace Loh fired Durkin the next day.  Matt Canada (Interim; 2018)  On August 11, 2018, Canada became interim head coach for the Maryland Terrapins after D.J. Durkin was put on administrative leave following the death of Jordan McNair, an offensive lineman for the Maryland Terrapins. After Mike Locksley was hired as the permanent head coach at Maryland going forward, Canada was relieved of the day-to-day head coaching responsibilities.  Mike Locksley (2019-Present)  On December 4, 2018, Locksley was named head football coach at the University of Maryland, becoming the 21st full-time head coach in program history. Locksley led Maryland to a strong offensive start. In the first game of the 2019 season, Maryland defeated FCS affiliate Howard 79-0, following that up with a victory against 21st-ranked Syracuse 63-20. The 142 points in its first two games marked the Terps‚Äô highest-ever scoring output in consecutive games, and the 63 points scored against Syracuse were the most points scored by a Maryland football team against a ranked opponent in program history. After starting strong and being ranked 21 in the AP polls, the Terrapins began struggling, finishing the season with a disappointing 3-9 record (1-5 Big 10), with a lone conference win at Rutgers in week 5. Mike Locksley is a highly praised recruiter, and many Maryland fans are optimistic about the team‚Äôs future.

Greenspoon made notable contributions to the field of behaviorism in psychology through pioneering work on verbal operant conditioning and counterconditioning in the treatment of anxiety.  Education  Greenspoon received his B.A. degree from the University of Virginia in 1941. Immediately after college he coached at Fishburne Military School in Virginia. This experience (and world events at the time) led to his service in the United States Army from 1942-1946. Upon returning from duty he completed his M.A. degree in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1947. He completed his education at Indiana University earning his Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology in 1952. During his graduate school years at Indiana University he was directly supervised by Burrhus F. Skinner, William S. Verplanck, and J. R. Kantor. Greenspoon directly attributes his passion for behaviorism to his introduction to Skinner during Skinner‚Äôs chairmanship of the psychology department there.  Professional life  = Teaching and administrative work = Greenspoon described his greatest passion as teaching. He taught continuously for 49 years and helped promote clinical psychology graduate programs, particularly advocating for the advancement of behaviorism in clinical practice and research. He began teaching as a faculty member at Pomona College immediately after receiving his Ph.D. He then helped develop the graduate program in clinical psychology at Florida State University and spent time at Arizona State University. He served as department chair of psychology and dean of arts and sciences at Temple Buell College, served as department chair of psychology at the University of Texas-Permian Basin, and served as department chair of psychology at the University of North Carolina ‚Äì Charlotte. While at UTPB, he founded the Center for Behavioral Analysis. This Center was completely funded from proceeds from his private practice and continued to be so for 10 years following his death. He completed his career teaching at the University of North Texas where he was designated as an unpaid visiting professor. Greenspoon described this as his \\"dream job\\", characterizing it as \\"no pay, no responsibilities\\". = Clinical work = Throughout his career Greenspoon provided therapy services utilizing the science of behavioral analysis and operant conditioning. He ran a private practice out of a mobile trailer during his time in Texas where he worked treating individuals, predominantly with anxiety disorders. He regularly consulted and worked in clinical settings within hospitals, universities, and community mental health centers. Towards the culmination of his career he advised many researchers applying behavioral principles to the treatment of autism in children. He also served on numerous clinical psychology licensing boards in Texas. = Research and publications = Greenspoon authored over 50 journal articles and book chapters and wrote two textbooks accumulating over 1600 citations in peer literature. As an early proponent and central figure in the development of behavioral analysis in people, his work helped promote the field both in programming in universities across the nation and in scientific literature. He also had brief stints in his early career as a researcher at the U. S. Navy Electronics Laboratory and Aerojet General, both in California. His selected works include: * The reinforcing effect of two spoken sounds on the frequency of two responses (Greenspoon, 1955) * Verbal conditioning and clinical psychology (Greenspoon, 1962) * Psychotherapy from the standpoint of a behaviorist (Greenspoon & Brownstein, 1967) = Mentoring = During his tenure at Arizona State University, Greenspoon supervised Robert O. Pihl‚Äôs graduate training. Pihl went onto a highly successful career as a clinical psychologist spearheading the field of alcohol-related aggression and substance abuse research at McGill University. = Awards and legacy = Greenspoon was awarded the 2011 Texas Association for Behavioral Analysis Pioneer in Behavioral Analysis award for his contributions to behavioral analysis in Texas. Paul R. Fuller, a colleague of Greenspoon from Indiana University, described Greenspoon as \\"‚Ä¶not only a best friend, he was a role model and an inspiration in strength and persistence‚Äù.  Personal life  Greenspoon was born on October 11, 1920 in the small community of Charles Town, West Virginia. He was married to Alice Marie Greenspoon for almost 49 years, and who survived him for many years before passing away on May 29, 2013. Together they had a son and two daughters.  Death  Greenspoon died on April 20, 2004 at the age of 83 in Denton, Texas. He died due to complications from leukemia.

He was elected Colombia's youngest president, as the candidate from the Democratic Centre Party in the 2018 presidential election. Backed by his mentor, former President Alvaro Uribe, he ran a campaign where he stood against the peace treaty with the guerilla group FARC. His tenure has been criticized for the increasing incidence of massacres of unarmed civilians, the increasing number of murders against community leaders (205 since taking office), the increasing number of murders against ex-guerrilla fighters that surrendered under a previous peace agreement (224), the increasing murder of union leaders and environmentalists and the impunity related to this cases. He has also been criticized for stopping peace negotiations with ELN and resuming war operations, the use of the military to squash anti-government protests (particularly during the 2019 protests), the expulsion of United Nations Human Rights Observers and the use of small weapons live fire by the police to squash the 2020 Bogota Protests which left 13 dead and over 400 injured. Life and career Duque's father, Iv√°n Duque Escobar Duque was born in Bogota, in a wealthy political family that originally came from the Colombian town of Gomez Plata, Antioquia.

Duque‚Äôs siblings are Andr√©s and Mar√≠a Paula. Duque attended Colegio Rochester and graduated from Sergio Arboleda University in Bogot√° in 2000 with a degree in law. He holds a LLM in International Economic Law from American University and a Masters in Public Policy Management from Georgetown University, Washington D.C.. Duque also attended an Executive Education course at Harvard University for 5 days, where he studied business and government. He began his professional career in 1999 as a consultant in the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and later served as an advisor at the Colombian Ministry of Finance and Public Credit during the government of Andr√©s Pastrana (1998‚Äì2002). Subsequently, he was appointed by Juan Manuel Santos, future president and then Minister of Finance, as one of Colombia's representatives at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), a post he held between 2001 and 2013.

Political background Duque returned to Colombia to become a candidate for the Senate in the legislative elections of 2014, for the Partido Centro Democr√°tico (Democratic Center Party) which split away from the ruling governing party after Juan Manuel Santos opened peace negotiations with the FARC. This new party campaigned against the new peace agreement and the Santos Government, and was led by right wing former president Uribe. Uribe created his own political party and presented himself and a list of hand picked political allies as candidates for the office of Congressman in a closed list, which meant that people could not vote for an individual congressman but had to vote for the party as a whole in both the upper and lower chamber elections. Duque was included in the number seven spot of the closed off list for the Senate and thus was elected senator. During his time as a senator, he was the author of four laws: * Law 1822 of January 4, 2017, increasing the maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, so mothers could spend more time with their newborn children, a benefit that was also extended to adoptive mothers. * Law 1831 of May 2, 2017, for the availability of defibrillators in public facilities and places of high public influx, in order to save lives, since heart attacks are the leading cause of death in Colombia. * Law 1809 of September 29, 2016, for the use of advanced severance payments for educational insurance, so that more families can send their children to the university. * Law 1834 of May 23, 2017, the \\"Orange Law\\" for the promotion, development and protection of the creative and cultural industries.

He won the nomination through a system of surveys conducted by the party, with a 29.47% favorability compared to the other two candidates: Carlos Holmes Trujillo who obtained 20.15%, and Rafael Nieto with 20.06%. In January 2018, it was announced that the center-right coalition would participate in the Grand Primary for Colombia ‚Äì an interparty consultation - with Duque as its candidate confronting Marta Luc√≠a Ram√≠rez (civil-center right movement) and Alejandro Ord√≥√±ez (right wing civil movement).

Ivan Duque's government has been a vocal supporter for the Venezuelan Refugees at the United Nations and has provided aid, schooling and health care for many, and has been a vocal critic of other South American countries closing of doors to Venezuelan Refugees. In 2018 Duque has dedicated .5% of Government Spending to supporting refugees accounting for about 20% of Colombia's budget short fall, despite opposition. In response to this criticism on a televised address Duque stated: ‚ÄúFor those who want to make from xenophobia a political path, we adopt the path of brotherhood, for those who want to outcast or discriminate against migrants, we stand up today ‚Ä¶ to say that we are going to take them in and we are going to support them during difficult times.‚Äù Duque's policies regarding have received repeated praise from international humanitarian organizations for its efforts to legalize, formalize and offer assistance to refugees, and the Atlantic has noted that it has set the bar welcoming refugees.

Early life Cornelius \\"Corneel\\" Jeremiah Vanderbilt was born on Staten Island on December 29, 1830. He was the second son of thirteen children born to Cornelius Vanderbilt and Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt, who were first cousins. He had 11 surviving siblings; Phebe, Ethelinda, Eliza, William (\\"Billy\\"), Emily, Sophia, Maria, Frances, Mary, Catherine, and George. He had another brother named George, born in 1832, who died as a toddler. According to official records, Corneel was matriculated at Columbia College with the class of 1850, but did not graduate with the class. When he was 18 years old, Corneel began suffering from epilepsy, which his father saw as weakness and even mental derangement, believing his son needed to be in a mental asylum. His father thought the epileptic fits were a punishment on himself for his having married his own cousin. In 1849, in order to ‚Äòtoughen him up,‚Äô his father sent the then 19 year old Corneel off to be a sailor aboard a three-masted schooner which was making its way to California and its gold fields. However, Corneel was stricken ill when he arrived in San Francisco and drew a draft on his father in order to pay for his return to New York. Upon his return, his father had him arrested for drawing the draft and committed him to the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. Corneel's records from the asylum state: \\"Form of mental disorder: dementia (supported by father)\\" He was finally discharged from the asylum on February 20, 1850. Corneel being committed to Bloomingdale Insane Asylum by his father happened just five years after his mother, Sophia, had also briefly been committed by his father to the same asylum. In 1844, his father sent Sophia on a trip to Canada with one of their daughters, in order to have more private time with their governess (who promptly quit). When Sophia returned, she found that her husband had purchased a large townhouse at 10 Washington Place in New York City and intended it to be their new residence. She was so upset that she stood up to the domineering Cornelius and steadfastly refused to leave their Staten Island home and friends. His father decided that she was mentally unstable due to this behavior. He told their children that their mother was \\"in poor health\\" and that she \\"was at the change of life.\\" Against protests from all of their children (except William), their father had their mother committed to Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. However, the physicians there insisted she return home. When she did, she reluctantly acquiesced to her husband's demands and moved to New York City. Career On March 4, 1849, young Vanderbilt departed on a ship headed for San Francisco around Cape Horn to work as a crewman. Upon arrival in San Francisco, he abandoned the ship and spent all his money. When he ran out, he tried to charge his expenses to his father, who became livid and interpreted Corneel's actions as a sign of insanity. When Corneel returned to New York in November 1849, his father had him arrested and committed to the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum in New York until February 1850. After his release, he tried out several occupations, including law clerk, leather merchant, farmer, and revenue agent; all of which he was unsuccessful at. He developed a gambling problem and reportedly used the Vanderbilt name and his considerable charm to borrow money, usually without paying them back. In particular, he obtained significant loans from Horace Greeley, the editor of the New York Tribune who was a long-time friend. Corneel was also close friends with Schuyler Colfax, who later became the 17th Vice President of the United States under Ulysses S. Grant. In January 1854, the elder Cornelius again had Corneel arrested and committed to the asylum on the grounds of \\"confusion\\" and \\"loose habits.\\" The doctor at the asylum reportedly told Corneel, \\"I am satisfied that you are no more crazy than I am,\\" and let him go home. His elder brother William told him that they were trying to get him committed to the Asylum in order to avoid Corneel being charged criminally for his acts of forgery, to which Corneel reportedly replied that he would rather be considered a damn rascal than a lunatic. Personal life In 1856, he married Ellen Williams (1820‚Äì1872) of Hartford, Connecticut, the daughter of a minister. The marriage was reportedly the only thing in Corneel's life that pleased his father; however, they did not have any children. With funds from his allowance, Corneel set up a fruit farm in East Hartford, Connecticut, but was unable to make the farm solvent, and had to file for bankruptcy in 1868. After his mother's death in 1868, and the death of his wife in 1872, Vanderbilt \\"took up with George Terry, an unmarried hotel keeper whom Corneel considered 'my dearest friend,'\\" Vanderbilt biographer T. J. Stiles has questioned whether the two may have been lovers, which the elder Cornelius may have suspected. Their letters between each other were intense, including a letter where Vanderbilt writes: \\"Oh! George I cannot give you up. You must not desert me now, but must be brave & patient, and give me encouragement and hope for the future.\\" Terry met with the Commodore in December 1873 about a business proposition in Toledo, Ohio, to which he replied: \\"Mr. Terry, if you go to Toledo, what will become of Corneel?\\" =Father's estate= West Hartford. Upon his father's death in 1877, his elder brother William inherited the vast majority of the Vanderbilt estate and holdings (around $100,000,000), becoming the wealthiest man in the United States. According to his father's will, Corneel was only to inherit the income from $200,000 in U.S. Bonds held in trust (receiving 5% interest), which was distributed by trustees who were cautioned to oversee his behavior. Additionally, should Corneel try to advance funds from the Trust, he would lose it altogether. After a lengthy court battle, William eventually paid Corneel an extra $600,000 ($200,000 in cash and $400,000 in additional trust) allowing him to pay off his debts, including to the estate of the late Horace Greeley, which aggregated to approximately $61,000 including interest. According to his obituary, \\"almost immediately after the settlement Cornelius J. went to Europe, accompanied by his particular friend, Mr. Terry, and remained abroad over six months.\\" The Commodore had purchased a 110-acre West Hartford estate in 1857 as a place for his Corneel to live. The land was not developed, and after the death of Corneel's wife in 1872, the Commodore sold the property. In 1879, two years after the elder Cornelius' death, Corneel repurchased the estate. After Corneel owned the estate, he built a 30-room home mansion, designed by John C. Mead, on the land. =1882 suicide= On April 2, 1882, reportedly after a night spent at a gambling house, the 51-year-old Vanderbilt committed suicide at the Glenham Hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He was discovered in his fifth floor room, number 80, by Terry, who was referred to in Vanderbilt's obituary as \\"his friend and constant companion.\\" Terry was staying in an adjourning room, number 79, and reportedly rushed through the connecting door to Corneel's room upon hearing the gun shot that killed Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt left his recently finished mansion in Hartford, which he was supposed to move into a few weeks later, to his dearest friend Terry. Terry sold the estate, which was subdivided into 32 building lots.

Andersen stayed with the family from 13 March until 21 May 1870 in their residence on H√∏jbro Plads, where he wrote What the Whole Family Said, and the Melchiors also hosted the celebration of his 70th birthday. He spent his last year at Rolighed where he died on 4 August 1875. Legacy Melchiors Plads, located close to Melchior's now demolished country house Rolighed, is named after him. A plaque on Kalkbr√¶nderi Vej 16 commemorates that Hans Christian Andersen died at the site.

Gardner (born 1975) is an American politician and attorney from the state of Missouri. She is the circuit attorney for the city of St. Louis, Missouri. She previously served as a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.  Early life and education  Gardner was born in 1975 and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. Her family runs a funeral home in North St. Louis, at which she also worked. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in healthcare administration from Harris‚ÄìStowe State University in 1999. She then earned a Juris Doctor from the Saint Louis University School of Law in 2003 and a Master of Science in nursing from Saint Louis University in 2012.  Career  Gardner worked at Bell, Kirksey & Associates and as an assistant prosecutor (St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office, 2005‚Äì2010) prior to being elected as Circuit Attorney. From 2013 to 2017 she was a Missouri State Representative for District 77. = 2016 campaign = Gardner ran against three Democratic opponents to secure her post as Circuit Attorney n the 2016 elections, following the retirement of Jennifer Joyce. She ran on reforming and rebuilding trust in the criminal justice system and reducing violent crime. She also promised to increase diversity, bring independent investigations of police use of force, work to reduce racial disparities, and enhance gun control. Gardner's campaign accepted $190,750.73 from 'Super PACs' (Political Action Committees) funded in part by billionaire George Soros. =Circuit Attorney= Gardner took office on January 6, 2017.https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/100-days-st-louis-circuit-attorney- focuses-strengthening-police-community-ties#stream/0 She is the first African- American to head the Circuit Attorney's Office. Under Gardner's tenure, St. Louis has seen a significant increase in non-prosecuted felonies. In 2019, St. Louis police sought 7,045 felony cases, but only 1,641 were prosecuted by Gardner's office. Many were returned to the police citing insufficient evidence, despite claims of sufficient evidence to prosecute by the police union. Gardner continued the prosecution of former St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department police officer Jason Stockley for first degree murder in the shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, a case first filed by her predecessor Jennifer Joyce. The acquittal in the bench trial in a controversial decision by Judge Timothy Wilson led to intense protests in the latter months of 2017. As Circuit Attorney, Gardner has reduced and removed or reduced amounts of cash bond for minor, nonviolent offenses. She is also expanding diversion and drug court programs, and consulting with the Vera Institute of Justice on these issues. She is ending prosecutions of low-level marijuana possession and is dismissing many cases. The CAO is sharing a federal grant to work with the Midwest Innocence Project on wrongful convictions. In the summer of the 2018, the existence of an \\"exclusion list\\" (similar to a \\"Brady list\\" in other jurisdictions) of 28 SLMPD officers whose conduct is considered so tainted by misconduct that the CAO would no longer accept testimony or evidence in court cases and would reconsider past cases. Fifty-five prosecutors and law enforcement officials from across the United States signed a statement supporting Gardner's Brady List. Gardner, in February 2019, announced that the CAO and police department are working together on problems stemming from the list. In January 2019, Gardner's office accused officers within SLMPD of obstructing their investigation in the shooting death of officer Katlyn Alix by officer Nathaniel R. Hendren, one of two officers charged with crimes relating to the incident, which resulted in a sharp rebuke by Chief John Hayden. In 2019, Gardner admitted to repeat campaign finance violations dating back to her time as a Missouri State Legislator. These violations included using campaign donations to pay for a private apartment. Gardner reached an agreement with the Missouri Ethics Commission to pay a settlement of $6,314 in lieu of a $63,009 fine.  Staff shortage  The Circuit Attorney's Office has experienced a more than 100% turnover rate in staff since Gardner took office. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in September 2019 that \\"over 65 attorneys with a combined experience of over 460 years in prosecutorial experience\\" have left the Circuit Attorney's office under Gardner. = Eric Greitens investigation and indictment = Gardner's office secured a grand jury indictment of sitting Missouri Governor Eric Greitens in February 2018, for felony invasion of privacy. On April 20, 2018, Gardner's office announced a new charge of tampering with computer data against Greitens. The governor was swiftly released on his own recognizance. Then Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley had opportunity to prosecute but declined to do so. In May 2018, the judge in the Greitens case ruled that the defense could call Gardner as a witness due to suspected criminal conduct by the prosecution. Following the judge's ruling, Gardner's office announced that they would be dismissing the invasion of privacy charge citing that Gardner could not testify in a case her office was prosecuting. Following the Governor's announcement that he planned to resign, Gardner announced that all charges against Greitens would be dropped. On May 15, 2018, Missouri Governor Eric Greitens' attorneys filed a police report with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department alleging perjury by William Don Tisaby, an ex-FBI agent and private investigator that Gardner hired to investigate Greitens. Defense attorneys also cited $100,000 in secret cash payments to witnesses, payments they stated were concealed from the defense team by Gardner, as well as numerous meetings between the Circuit Attorney and William Tisaby, and \\"a major witness in the case\\". In a statement regarding the police report, defense attorneys said, \\"By law, both the Circuit Attorney and William Tisaby were required to testify about what was said and done in those secret meetings. Both refused to do so.\\" Tisaby asserted his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in response to over 50 questions. Special prosecutor investigation On June 29, 2018, St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Mullen appointed St. Louis attorney Gerard Carmody as special prosecutor to investigate allegations of criminal misconduct in the case against Governor Eric Greitens. Gardner appealed the appointment of a special prosecutor to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ruled that Gardner had a conflict of interest in the case and upheld Mullen's appointment of Carmody. The Missouri Supreme Court also rejected an appeal from Gardner's office seeking to block a search warrant signed by Mullen for the files of the Gardner's office; the court ordered Gardner to turn over servers requested by Carmody. On June 17, 2019, a 30-page grand jury indictment was unsealed against William Don Tisaby, the private investigator hired by Gardner to investigate Greitens, charging him with six counts of felony perjury and one count of felony tampering with evidence. The indictment alleges that Tisaby lied under oath \\"matters that could substantially affect, or did substantially affect, the course or outcome of the Greitens case\\" (specifically, about his contacts with a major witness in the case and the nature of those conversations) and had concealed documents from defense attorneys. Tisby pleaded not guilty. In June 2019, Tisaby's attorney told reporters that \\"Ms. Gardner is probably the actual target here, not Mr. Tisaby.\\" Although Gardner was not indicted, the indictment against Tisaby stated that Gardner \\"failed to correct Tisaby‚Äôs lies, failed to report them to police, and made incorrect statements to defense lawyers and the judge.\\" On July 10, 2019, the grand jury disbanded without charging Gardner. The next day, Gardner held a press conference denying any wrongdoing in Greitens's case (her first public statement on the matter since the appointment of the special prosecutor, as a gag order had been placed on the case for the duration of the grand jury) and saying it was time for the city to \\"move on\\". Following the press conference, special prosecutor Carmody took the unusual step of putting out a statement clarifying that the grand jury disbanded because its term expired, not because the investigation was complete. Carmody announced that despite the original grand jury's conclusion, his investigation would continue, pointing out his authority to seat a new grand jury to review any evidence relating to Gardner's conduct. Tisaby's motion to dismiss the indictment against him was denied by St. Louis Circuit Judge Bryan Hettenbach, who also placed a protective order on approximately 4,000 documents at Carmody's request to protect the privacy of some parties involved in the Greitens case and the integrity of \\"an active criminal investigation\\" focused on the failed prosecution of Greitens.  Traffic Stop Controversy  On December 23, 2019 (the day before Christmas Eve), Kim Gardner was pulled over by St. Louis downtown police on Market Street for a traffic stop. In January 2020, Gardner made numerous news interviews and public claims stating that: the stop was on December 24, 2019 (Christmas Eve), police had held her for 15 minutes without stating why, and that these were \\"intimidation tactics used by the police to stop reform\\". Police records state that the stop occurred on December 23, 2019 instead. KMOV4 news also published video evidence from a camera across the street revealing that St. Louis downtown police had pulled Gardner over when her car was shown driving without headlights on at night, and that the stop lasted for only 6 minutes. Gardner continued to claim that the stop lasted 15 minutes and was without reason. The Circuit Attorney's Office also sent an email statement that \\"According to the police it was a 15 minute stop. In addition, the officer's statement is different than the one shared by Jeff Roorda.\\" The St. Louis Police Sergeant then issued a follow-up statement that the police had never stated Gardner was detained for 15 minutes. The St. Louis Police statement also reveals that an Investigator from the Circuit Attorney's Office had attempted to involve himself into the traffic investigation, which is an illegal act and the investigator could have been arrested for it. The St. Louis Police did not arrest the Investigator. The Circuit Attorney's Office continued to assert Garner's false allegations.  Civil rights lawsuit  In January 2020, Gardner filed a civil rights lawsuit against St. Louis City and St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department on the basis of the Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and Ku Klux Klan Act of 1865, alleging a racist conspiracy. The lawsuit cites a 2016 report from the Ethical Society of Police detailing a history of racial discrimination in the police force, as well as the Plain View Project's report exposing city police officers' racist social media activities. The city and the St. Louis Police Officers Association, led by Jeff Roorda, denied the lawsuit's allegations. Several African American women district attorneys, including Marilyn Mosby and Aramis Ayala, traveled to St. Louis to demonstrate support for Gardner, declaring that she has been targeted by a \\"fundamentally racist\\" system which they also contend against. On 30 Sept 2020, U.S. District Judge John Ross dismissed St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner‚Äôs lawsuit. The judge wrote that: wrote: ‚ÄúHer 32-page complaint can best be described as a conglomeration of unrelated claims and conclusory statements supported by very few facts, which do not plead any recognizable cause of action‚Äù and continued that \\"Gardner presents no specific material facts, circumstantial or otherwise, to show that defendants acted with each other for the purpose of depriving her ‚Äì or anyone else ‚Äì of a constitutional right to equal protection. Her complaint is nothing more than a compilation of personal slights ‚Äì none of which rise to a legal cause of action.\\" Judge Ross is a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. He was nominated by President Barack Obama in December 2010. Prior to becoming a federal judge, Ross was a circuit court judge for the 21st Circuit Court in Missouri. The costs to defend her out of taxpayer funds has been widely discussed. Invoices and receipts obtained by the Post-Dispatch show the city in June approved and paid the Brown & James firm about $153,600 in legal bills to defend the Circuit Attorney‚Äôs Office against two lawsuits. The city paid about 80% of those bills three weeks after Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty blocked payments to at least five other private firms.  Open records lawsuit  In January 2020, Fox News contributor and political commentator John Solomon sued Gardner and several others--including former State Representatives Jay Barnes and Stacey Newman, billionaire political donor George Soros, and individuals connected to the state's low income housing tax credit industry--in the St. Louis Circuit Court, alleging violations of Missouri's open records laws. Solomon claimed that Gardner's office violated the state's \\"Sunshine Law\\" by refusing to make available records involving investigations into former Republican Missouri Governor Eric Greitens. = 2020= In June 2020, 36 people were arrested in St. Louis during two nights of the George Floyd protests for alleged trespassing, burglary, property damage, assault, and theft. All were released, two after being issued summons, eight after prosecutors declined to immediately file a charge, and the rest \\"while police apply for charges.\\" Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, criticized Gardner on Twitter over the arrestees' release. Gardner said she would bring \\"the full power of the law\\" against those responsible for violent acts, but, responding to Schmitt, said that the prosecutor's office cannot bring charges against individuals without admissible evidence from police. Gardner criticized Schmitt for launching \\"a politically motivated attack against me, even if it means misleading and lying to the public.\\" = 2020 campaign = On August 4, Gardner won a contested primary for reelection, receiving 60.7% of the vote against her leading 2016 primary opponent, Mary Pat Carl, and will run against Republican Daniel Zdrodowski in November.Kim Gardner wins in rematch for St. Louis Circuit Attorney, Kansas City Star, Kelsey Landis, August 4, 2020.

History The company was founded on 19 April 1999 thanks to a partnership between Societ√† Autostrade (through Sitec, 32%), British Telecom (20%), Benetton (through the financial Edizione Holding, 9%), Mediaset (9%) , Distacom (9%), BNL (7%), Italgas (7%), Caltagirone (7%) and Palatinus. The slogan used was \\"Il futuro che non c'era\\" (\\"The future that was not there\\"). The services were activated on May 15, 2000, using the license number 61 issued shortly after the birth by the Italian Ministry of Communications, valid for communications through the GSM system on the 1800 MHz frequency band: the signal with its own network was initially irradiated only in Milan while, in the rest of Italy, the transmission occurred with the GSM network of other operators thanks to national roaming agreements. With 430,000 users in September 2000, the company exceeded its initial target of reaching 350,000 customers by the end of the year: nevertheless, the lack of agreement between British Telecom and the other shareholders regarding the distribution of shares put the company's participation in the auction for the awarding of UMTS licenses, initially confirmed, and then withdrawn on 23 October. The case involved judicial trials that ended in January 2001, when the Lazio Regional Administrative Court annulled the government confiscation of the surety of 4000 billion lire. In the meantime, the company continued its development launching the GPRS service in December 2000, exceeding one million users in March 2001 and acquiring, in August of the same year, the license for fixed telephony. Despite the continued expansion (with 1,600,000 customers at the end of 2001 with a market share of new activations of 13%), the first defections began among the company's partners, with Edition that in September 2001 renounced its shares after the entry into the Telecom Italia group and Mediaset which in December 2001 sold the shares in its possession to British Telecom. The telephone operator thus entered a phase of progressive demobilization: on 6 August 2002 the board of directors gave the go-ahead to the company break-up, opting for the sale of the customer base (4% of the Italian market) and brand to Wind, mobile telephone systems at TIM, Wind and Vodafone Omnitel, the share capital at TIM and other branches of the company at H3G.

In January 2017, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping and his administration created a Central Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee (CMCFDC) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which is intended to speed the transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military.:19 State Plan The State Council of China issued the \\"A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\\" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the CCP Central Committee and the State Council urged the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the plan describes AI as a ‚Äústrategic technology‚Äù that has become a ‚Äúfocus of international competition‚Äù.:2 On the occasion of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's speech at the first plenary meeting of the CMCFDC, scholars from the National Defense University in their analysis of the integration of military and civilian development wrote in the PLA Daily that the \\"transferability of social resources\\" between economic and military ends is an essential component to being a great power. In 2018, the State Council budgeted $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in Mentougou district. In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments. Some of the stated motivations that the State Council has given for pursuing its AI strategy include the potential of artificial intelligence for industrial transformation, better social governance and maintaining social stability. The State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy. By 2020, the State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries. By 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that \\"AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation\\" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries. By 2030, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a \\"mature new-generation AI theory and technology system.\\" At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries. Industry developments According to a February 2019 publication by the Center for a New American Security, China‚Äôs leadership ‚Äì including Chinese leader Xi Jinping ‚Äì believes that being at the forefront in AI technology will be critical to the future of global military and economic power competition. China is by far the United States‚Äô most ambitious competitor in the international AI market, and China's 2017 ‚ÄúNext Generation AI Development Plan‚Äù describes AI as a ‚Äústrategic technology‚Äù that has become a ‚Äúfocus of international competition‚Äù.:2 According to the document, China will seek to develop a core AI industry worth over 150 billion RMB132‚Äîor approximately $21.7 billion‚Äîby 2020 and will ‚Äúfirmly seize the strategic initiative‚Äù and reach ‚Äúworld leading levels‚Äù of AI investment by 2030.:2-6 Recent Chinese achievements in the field demonstrate China's potential to realize its goals for AI development. In 2015, China's leading AI company, Baidu, created AI software capable of surpassing human levels of language recognition, almost a year in advance of Microsoft, the nearest U.S. competitor. In 2016 and 2017, Chinese teams won the top prize at the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, an international competition for Computer vision systems. Many of these systems are now being integrated into China's domestic surveillance network and Social Credit System, which aims to monitor and, based on social behavior, ‚Äúgrade‚Äù every Chinese citizen by 2021. China is researching various types of air, land, sea, and undersea autonomous vehicles. In the spring of 2017, a civilian Chinese university with ties to the military demonstrated an AI-enabled swarm of 1,000 uninhabited aerial vehicles at an airshow. A media report released after the fact showed a computer simulation of a similar swarm formation finding and destroying a missile launcher.:23 Open-source publications indicate that China is also developing a suite of AI tools for cyber operations.:27 Chinese development of military AI is influenced in large part by China's observation of U.S. plans for defense innovation and fears of a widening ‚Äúgenerational gap‚Äù in comparison to the U.S. military. Similar to U.S. military concepts, the Chinese aim to use AI for exploiting large troves of intelligence, generating a common operating picture, and accelerating battlefield decision-making.:12-14 China's management of its AI ecosystem contrasts with that of the United States.:6 In general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university research laboratories, the military, and the central government. As a result, the Chinese government has a direct means of guiding AI development priorities and accessing technology that was ostensibly developed for civilian purposes. To further strengthen these ties, the Chinese government created in January 2017 a Military-Civil Fusion Development Commission, which is intended to speed the transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military.:19 In addition, the Chinese government is leveraging both lower barriers to data collection and lower costs to data labeling to create the large databases on which AI systems train. According to one estimate, China is on track to possess 20% of the world's share of data by 2020, with the potential to have over 30% by 2030.:12 China's centrally directed effort is investing in the U.S. AI market, in companies working on militarily relevant AI applications, potentially granting it lawful access to U.S. technology and intellectual property. Chinese venture capital investment in U.S. AI companies between 2010 and 2017 totalled an estimated $1.3 billion. Although Peking University introduced in 2004 the first academic course on AI which led other Chinese universities to adopt AI as a discipline, China faces challenges in recruiting and retaining AI engineers and researchers. Over half of the data scientists in the United States have been working in the field for over 10 years, while roughly the same proportion of data scientists in China have less than 5 years of experience. As of 2017, fewer than 30 Chinese universities produce AI-focused experts and research products.:8 Although China surpassed the United States in the quantity of research papers produced from 2011 to 2015, the quality of its published papers, as judged by peer citations, ranked 34th globally. China is, however, making efforts to address these deficiencies, with a particular focus on the development of military AI applications. Indeed, the Beijing Institute of Technology, one of China's premier institutes for weapons research, recently established the first children's educational programme in military AI in the world.  Notable Companies  Leading AI-centric companies and start-ups include Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, SenseTime and Yitu Technology. Chinese AI companies iFlytek, SenseTime, Cloudwalk and DJI have received attention for facial recognition, sound recognition and drone technologies. Reception An article published by the Center for a New American Security concluded that \\"Chinese government officials demonstrated remarkably keen understanding of the issues surrounding AI and international security...this includes knowledge of U.S. AI policy discussions.\\" and recommended that \\"the U.S. policymaking community similarly prioritize cultivating expertise and understanding of AI developments in China\\" and \\"funding, focus, and a willingness among U.S. policymakers to drive large-scale necessary change.\\" An article in the MIT Technology Review similarly concluded: \\"China might have unparalleled resources and enormous untapped potential, but the West has world-leading expertise and a strong research culture. Rather than worry about China‚Äôs progress, it would be wise for Western nations to focus on their existing strengths, investing heavily in research and education.\\" Some experts believe that China's intent to be the first to develop military AI applications may result in comparatively less safe applications, as China will likely be more risk-acceptant throughout the development process. These experts stated that it would be unethical for the U.S. military to sacrifice safety standards for the sake of external time pressures, but that the United States‚Äô more conservative approach to AI development may result in more capable systems in the long run. :23  See also  * Artificial intelligence * Artificial intelligence arms race * China Brain Project * Regulation of artificial intelligence References Category:Artificial intelligence ","title":"Artificial intelligence industry in China"},{"id":"57024226","text":"London Bridge is a natural arch on the coast of Torquay in Devon, England.

During that period and thereafter it has been depicted in numerous works of art. Recreation London Bridge is a popular climbing crag, and is a well-known venue for deep water soloing. The arch and the area in the vicinity including the long abandoned Dyer's Quarry is a location well-liked for coasteering, due to its secluded location close to Torquay, and there are many possible jumps, some of which are said to be the best in the area. There is also a scuba diving spot nearby, called 'The Pipes', which is so named as there is a collection of pipes spilled from the wreck of a barge which rests nearby on the seabed. It is noted to be an ideal site for trainee divers. Ballan wrasse, conger eel and other fish are also in abundance near the arch and fishing hobbyists take advantage of this.

Later, he studied Chinese linguistics at Peking University. In 1978, he was assigned a position at the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhongguo kexueyuan shengxue yanjiusuo) as an associate researcher. In 1982, Chen became a professor in the department of linguistics in Beijing Language and Culture College (currently Beijing Language and Culture University). His book The Economic Life of Liberators (Heyi weisheng: Wenhuamingren de jingji beijing ) was considered the best published work on the economic status of such prominent scholars such as Lu Xun, Kang Youwei, and Cai Yuanpei.Sun Saiyin, Beyond the Iron House: Lu Xun and the Modern Chinese Literary Field (New York: Routledge, 2016), 27.

However, Mao refused to comment. Thus, Chen was imprisoned twice during the Cultural Revolution. He was released after the death of Mao.Chai Ling, A Heart for Freedom (Carol Stream, IL: Tyndale House, 2011), 106. The government officially rehabilitated Chen in 1978.  During the protests  Chen openly supported the student protests in 1989. When students became hesitant to continue their protests after mourning the death of Hu Yaobang, Chen encouraged them not to give up, but to continue their actions. On April 23, 1989, Chen gave an emotional speech at the Triangle in Peking University to the students. In his speech, Chen stated that intellectuals and students must not stay silent but speak out. First of all, Chen criticized the official mouthpieces such as China Central Television (CCTV) which falsely labelled the student protests as being anti-government in nature.Lian he bao bianjiubu ËÅîÂêàÊä•ÁºñËæëÈÉ®, Tiananmen 1989 Â§©ÂÆâÈó®1989 [The Gate of Heavenly Peace 1989] (Taipei: Lian jing chuban shiye gongsi, 1989), 271. Chen argued that the demonstration, petition, and the mourning for Hu Yaobang were spontaneous actions and there were no \\"black hands\\" behind them.Tiananmen 1989, 271-272. Thus, Chen described CCTV as the shameless mouthpiece of the government, who had lost their consciences and had lied to the public for decades.Tiananmen 1989, 271-274. Furthermore, Chen argued that social problems such as inflation, profiteering businesses, insufficient educational funds, and wealth polarization were caused by the immoral and corrupted officials and their relatives.Tiananmen 1989, 273-274. The government restricted freedom of speech and democracy because officials feared their scandals would be exposed.Tiananmen 1989, 272,274. To conclude, Chen encouraged students to continue their actions such as boycotting classes and participating demonstrations and to refuse comprise with the government.Tiananmen 1989, 274. At the very end of his speech, he shouted the slogan \\"give us liberty or give us death\\" and \\"long live students\\" to the protestors. According to Chai Ling's memoir, Chen's speech was \\"interrupted many times by thunderous applause.\\" During his speech, Chen compared himself to Wen Yiduo, a scholar who was assassinated by the Kuomintang secret agencies because of his anti-government speech during the Chinese Civil War in 1946. As Chen said: ‚ÄúI will be responsible for every word I said, and I am not afraid of any possible consequence including death. I am already forty-eight years old now, I am luckier than Mr. Wen who had sacrificed his life when he was forty-seven.\\" Tiananmen 1989, 270. Chen's speech was recorded and later disseminated to all major universities in Beijing and other cities as well. Wang Dan, one prominent student leader, recalled that students' confidence and motivation were restored after hearing Chen's expressive speech.Wang Dan Áéã‰∏π, Wang Dan huiyi lu: cong liusi dao liuwang Áéã‰∏πÂõûÂøÜÂΩïÔºö‰ªéÂÖ≠ÂõõÂà∞ÊµÅ‰∫° [Wang Dan‚Äôs Memoir: From June 4 to Exile] (Taipei: shibao wenhua, 2012), 181. Student leaders such as Liu Gang hoped other prominent scholars would also give similar speeches to students, but most scholars rejected the request and thought that Chen was too radical. Fang Lizhi, another famous scholar in Beijing, consistently warned Liu against the radicalization of students by speakers and scholars like Chen, or else some unwanted consequences might occur .Eddie Cheng, Standoff at Tiananmen (Highland Rach, Colorado: Sensys Corp., 2009), 96.  After the protest  Chen was arrested after the crackdown on the student protests, and was detained in Qincheng Prison, a maximum-security prison in Changping, Beijing, with other dissenters including Liu Xiaobo and Liu Gang.Gong Xiaoxuan, Liu Xiaobo zhuan [The Biography of Liu Xiaobo] (New York: Mirror Books, 2010), 120. According to Liu Gang's memoir, Chen pretended to be mentally ill and declared that all his wrong behaviors had been caused by his uncontrollable madness.Gong Xiaoxuan, Liu Xiaobo zhuan, 121. Chen was eventually released, but the length of his sentence and the time of his release remain unknown. Guo Moruo's son, Guo Pingying, sued against Chen in 1997 because Chen called himself the co-author of Xin Chao, a collection of modern poems translated and written by Guo Moruo.Wang Rongsheng ÁéãÊàéÁ¨ô, ‚ÄúXinchao jiamao shuming burong fan'an‚Äù„ÄäÊñ∞ÊΩÆ„ÄãÂÅáÂÜíÁΩ≤Âêç‰∏çÂÆπÁøªÊ°à [The Case of Signature Counterfeited of New Wave Is Not Allowed to Reverse], Beijing guancha Âåó‰∫¨ËßÇÂØü 10 (2000): 52.

The film is based on the novella The Visible Filth by Nathan Ballingrud. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019, and was released in the United States on October 18, 2019, by Hulu and internationally on Netflix. Plot Will is a New Orleans-based bartender who works at a run-down cockroach-infested bar. One evening, Alicia, her boyfriend Jeffrey, a drunk Eric, and a group of college kids enter the bar. Eric gets into a fight with another guest, resulting in Eric being stabbed in the cheek with a broken bottle. The kids leave the bar in a panic and Will discovers one of them has left their phone behind. Will returns to his house, which he shares with his student girlfriend Carrie. While inspecting the phone, he receives messages from someone called Garrett, who claims that he is scared and something from the \\"tunnel\\" is following him. The next morning, Will awakens to discover that overnight, Garrett has sent the phone a photo that shows a pile of bloody teeth. Carrie insists they call the police. Will drops Carrie off at school, where he suspects her professor is sleeping with her. He then visits Eric. Eric's wound is now infected, and he claims he is suffering from nightmares. Will spots some sort of inhuman flesh in Eric's wound. He visits Alicia and it is revealed that he has a crush on her and envies Jeffrey. Returning home, Will doesn't notice one of the college kids following him around town. He discovers photos and videos on the phone of a corpse and decapitated head being surrounded by cockroaches. Carrie sees the footage and forces Will to hand it over to the police. She discovers a book in one of the photos entitled \\"The Translation of Wounds\\". They call Garrett and hear an inhuman screeching on the other end. While driving to the station, Will spots one of the college kids following him and receives messages from another member of the group, stating that he \\"has been chosen\\". Will hallucinates the phone turning into a cockroach creature and throws it out the car window, where it is picked up by one of the kids. Without the phone, the police cannot do anything. Will and Alicia later hang and make out before Alicia stops, feeling guilty. Will receives strange texts from Carrie and discovers her at home, staring at a strange video of a tunnel in a trance. Carrie has no memory of sending Will the texts. Later that night, Will awakens to discover Garrett in the house. Garrett throws up a pile of teeth before claiming he and his friends summoned \\"something\\", that it possessed them and Will has now brought it into his own home: it now sees him as \\"the perfect vessel for more\\". Will hallucinates a cockroach crawling out of a wound in his armpit. Will and Carrie start to get more distant and aggressive to one another. He discovers she has been searching for Garrett online, as well as the books she noticed in the photo and Gnostic rituals which state that a wound is a portal for higher beings to enter the world. At work, Will gets more and more erratic and starts a fight with Jeffrey. He receives another text from Carrie, claiming someone is in the house with her. Will rushes home and discovers her in a trance again. She is in a catatonic state that does not stop until she is bathed, which results in a strange dark liquid washing off her. The next day, she and Will break up, with Carrie accusing Will of being empty. Will goes to work and snaps at his boss, resulting in him quitting, while Alicia tells him to stop calling her. Broken and alone, Will decides to stay at Eric's house. Eric's wound has worsened. He reveals the college kids forced him to lure Will to the house, and they asked him to give Will \\"a present\\". Will spots an eye looking at him through Eric's wound. He discovers the phone in Eric's possession and is prompted to accept the \\"present\\" wrapped in flesh. He realizes the higher being the kids summoned is inside Eric's wound. After calling Garrett again, which fills the room with the inhuman screeching, a swarm of cockroaches arrive. Will finally submits and starts to absorb the higher being in an attempt to become whole as cockroaches envelop the house.

History  In 1995, the idea arose to create a museum of the Holocaust in Odessa. It was proposed by two former prisoners of the ghetto and concentration camps: President of the Association \\"Ukraine-Israel\\", former prisoner of the concentration camp in Domanivka Dmitry Gutakhov and former prisoner of fascism, Nilva Efim. 14 years later, by the decision of the Council of Odessa regional Association of Jews‚Äîformer prisoners of ghettos and nazi concentration camps (Chairman of the Association ‚Äì Shvartsman Roman Markovich), 22 June 2009 the official opening of the Holocaust Museum in Odessa. On the opening day of the Museum the head of the society \\"Ukraine ‚Äì Israel\\" Dmitry Gutakhov, in his speech noted: The opening date of the Museum is symbolic. Precisely in this day, 22 June 1941 Nazi Germany attacked Soviet Union. Blitzkrieg on the eastern front was not only about instant military victory, it was also (if not mostly) about genocide and war crimes. Nazi Germany wanted to kill or enslave all of the Soviet Union's population, just like they were (trying) to do in Poland since 1 September 1939. Terrible war crimes were committed by both the SS groups just like the Wehrmacht. All Slavic, Roma, Jewish (hated the most by Nazis) and other people were considered by brainwashed Germans as subhumans, hence they didn't deserve no rights and dignity. Those who couldn't work for their \\"masters\\" from \\"master Aryan race\\" (Germans) and become their slaves were supposed to be exterminated. By decision of the Council of the Odessa Regional Association of Jews-former prisoners of the ghetto and nazi concentration camps, Sabulis Victor Franzevich was appointed the first director of the museum. On the eve of the opening of the museum Roman Markovich Shvartsman said:  Exhibits and Exposition  Initially in two halls of the museum about one and a half thousand exhibits were exposed: photos, documents, tablets and exhibits ‚Äì witnesses of that time, a kind part from which is taken from private collections of the Odessa Jews brought by former prisoners. A significant part of the exposition was transferred to the museum from Chicago (USA), now the late native of Odessa, former prisoner of the ghetto Lev Dumer. All exhibits are genuine, dedicated to Odessa citizens ‚Äì former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos, 400 of whom were lucky enough to survive the nightmares of the Holocaust and live to this day. These are graphic images, photographs, and relics, and photo documents about the horrors experienced during the Second World War by Jewish residents of Odessa and the region. Particularly painful impression the rope with which the nazis were hanged young girl. It was given to the museum by a man who, at that time, a boy, was in love with that girl‚Ä¶ Today, the Holocaust Museum is a two-storey complex, which houses a research library, a training center and a memorial space. = Exhibits = Initially, the exhibition gives an overview of the Holocaust, and then focuses on the fate of the Jews of Odessa and Pridnestrovie. In addition to the permanent exhibition, the museum offers audio and video interviews, a library and a memorial room. The permanent exhibition covers five halls of the Museum. * Hall of the library, which presents literature related to the history of the Holocaust, historical documents, artifacts , historical and personal photos, oral and video history, personal belongings of former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos. * Hall, which presents the history of the occupation of the fascists in Europe, and after the Odessa region. Here is a video card of the Transnistria, where death camps, labor camps and ghettos are marked. * Hall, which tells the story of the typical life of the pre-war Jewish family in Shtetl, so used to be called small town. * Hall of the Righteous Among the Nations. Here are photos, awards, personal belongings of the Righteous of the peoples of the world of Odessa region. * Hall of Victory. Here are pictures of military officers, sailors, heroes of the USSR, who participated in the liberation of the Odessa region from the nazi invaders, during the Second world war. = Exposition = The Museum also presents traveling exhibitions, where you can see Romanian, Roma, Bulgarian Jews, former prisoners of ghettos and concentration camps. By the 75th anniversary of the occupation of Odessa during the second world war, the Holocaust museum presented the exhibition \\"Documents of the Romanian occupation of Odessa 1941‚Äì1944 from the state archives of Odessa region\\". In January 2012, the international day of commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust saw the opening of an exhibition of photographs entitled \\"Holocaust in granite\\". The photographs presented unfailingly reveal the tragedy of the Holocaust. The exhibition is devoted to the tragic fate of the Jews of Odessa, Bessarabia and Bukovina, destroyed by the Romanian occupiers in 1941‚Äì1944 on the territory between the Southern Bug and the Dniester. Photos, which formed the basis of the exhibition, were taken from expeditions carried out in the period from 2011 to 2012. The expeditions are part of a major long-term project launched by the Odessa Holocaust Museum. In 2017 mini-diorama \\"Ghetto in Transnistria\\"appeared in the museum's collection. Diorama depicts a Jewish ghetto in the Odessa settlement, which was established by the occupiers in 1942. In it almost 90 figures, the size of which is 35 times less than human growth. The author of this project was the Odessa master-modeler Evgeniy Kapuka. In 2018 the museum presented the exhibition \\"Priests and Holocaust\\", dedicated to those who opposed totalitarian regimes and mass crimes in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Goals and objectives of the museum  The organizers of the museum set the main goal in the work of the museum: to collect, preserve and communicate to future generations the story of this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered, to educate a new generation of young people who will be able to resist and prevent the emergence of fascism in the 21st century. In his speech, Eduard Dolinsky, Director General of the Jewish Committee of Ukraine, noted: Chairman of the Association of former prisoners of concentration camps and ghettos Roman Shvartsman said: Today, the Museum presents a fairly large collection of exhibits. Over the years, since its opening, the Museum has been visited by more than 20 thousand people from around the world: ambassadors, diplomats, heads of cities and regions, students and schoolchildren, and just people who remember or want to learn about the terrible tragedy that is called the Holocaust.  Museum today  The author of the project of the information and historical reference book \\"Geography of the Holocaust\\", candidate of Philosophy, director of the Odessa Holocaust museum Pavel Efimovich Kozlenko marked: Today, the Museum has a new concept, the most convenient and understandable for visitors, created by Pavel Kozlenko, with the help of the Odessa regional Association of Jews‚Äîformer prisoners of the ghetto and nazi concentration camps. The Museum also collaborates with the Institute for the study of the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel (Romania).

The week-long conference is organized every spring and is the largest design initiative in South Eastern Europe. It covers architecture, design, fashion, publishing, and new media, as well as related fields like communications, marketing, advertising, and arts management. The event includes design labs, competitions, and presentations from international speakers like Karim Rashid and Daniel Libeskind. During the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project. The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the European Capital of Culture.  History  First held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant Jovan Jelovac, a formally trained architect. The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships. For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, Tomislav Nikoliƒá, presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy. In 2006, designer Karim Rashid was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference. As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city. Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it \\"as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places.\\" After attending the design festival in 2008, architect Daniel Libeskind left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront. Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city. Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau \\"Geozavod\\" building, are being restored. Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: \\"Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism.\\"  About  The principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store, the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory. Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape. Approximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include Konstantin Grcic, Aylin Langreuter, Christophe de la Fontaine, Hella Jongerius, Daan Roosegaarde, Ross Lovegrove. Christophe Pillet, Sacha Lakic and Patricia Urquiola. In addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.

It was circumscribed by Neal Evenhuis in 1981. Thirteen species are recognized, and they are found in Asia and Australasia. Taxonomic history The American entomologist Neal Evenhuis created the genus in a 1981 paper in Pacific Insects. His initial circumscription included eleven species. Four species had first been described in the genus Anthrax; Evenhuis described the other seven species in his initial circumscription. Evenhuis and Junichi Yukawa described an additional new species in 1986. Further changes to the list of species in Brachyanax occurred in 1988 and 1999. The generic name Brachyanax comes from the Greek (brakh√∫s; \\"small, short\\") and (√°nax; \\"lord, master, general-in- chief\\"). The specific epithet of the type species, thelestrephones, comes from the Greek (thƒìl·∏ó; \\"nipple\\") and (str√©ph≈ç; \\"twist\\"). This led to the American entomologist Arnold Menke including Brachyanax thelestrephones in his 1993 list \\"Funny or Curious Zoological Names\\"; Menke translated the binomen as \\"little chief nipple twister\\". Subsequent discussions of interesting taxonomic names have also included this binomen, using the same translation. The species B. thelestrephones became recognized as a junior synonym of B. satellitius in 1999. However, following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the type species of the genus remains Brachyanax thelestrephones. Phylogeny When Evenhuis circumscribed Brachyanax, he wrote this genus was between the tribes Anthracini and Exoprosopini although more similar to the former. Evenhuis and other dipterists have subsequently continued to place Brachyanax in Anthracini. The other genera placed in Anthracini are: Anthrax, Dicranoclista, Satyramoeba, Spogostylum, Thraxan, Turkmeniella, Walkeromyia, and Xenox. Distribution Brachyanax species are found in the Australasian/Oceanian realm (Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Bonin Islands), the Oriental realm (Indonesia, Philippines, Laos, India, Malaysia, Singapore, possibly China), and the Palearctic realm (Japan, possibly China). Description B. gentilis wing Males and females in the genus Brachyanax are morphologically the same except with respect to genitalia. Their body length is and their wingspan is . The head is either as wide as or narrower than the thorax; the abdomen is slightly narrower than the thorax. Brachyanax species have distinctive antennae: the pedicel, or second segment, is \\"spherically cone-shaped\\" and the base of the third segment, or flagellum, is rather enlarged and bulbous. The wing venation is also distinctive: the radial vein R originates near the r-m crossvein and gently curves 90¬∞ to the wing's margin. The radial veins R and R both lack an appendix, or spur-vein, at their base. The anal cell, or cell cup, is closed, typically with a short stalk. The basal portion of the wing is an opaque dark brown; this can cover one-third to four-fifths of each wing's area. The remainder of the wing is colourless and transparent. Its squamae and squamal fringe are brown to dark brown. Species In 2015, Evenhuis and D. J. Greathead recognized the following thirteen species in Brachyanax: * B. acroleucus * B. ater * B. aterrimus * B. bifuscatipennis * B. chichijimensis * B. costalis * B. gentilis * B. hemipenthes * B. leucostigma * B. magnipennis * B. papuanus * B. perniger * B. satellitius References Category:Bombyliidae Category:Brachycera genera Category:Diptera of Asia Category:Diptera of Australasia ","title":"Brachyanax"},{"id":"57024807","title":"1900 United States presidential election in Texas"},{"id":"57024810","text":"The Willits News is a twice weekly newspaper covering Willits, California and northern Mendocino County.

He joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1924, and became secretary of his union branch in 1943. In 1949, he was elected to the General Executive Council of the TGWU, and he served as vice-chairman and then, from 1960, as chairman of the council and president of the union. In 1958, Forden was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), despite still working on the buses, it being a tradition of the TGWU that one their nominees would not work full time for the union. He served until 1964, when he agreed to stand down, in order that Frank Cousins could take his place. He instead won election to the General Purposes Committee of the TUC. Forden was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1968, replacing Harry Nicholas, who had been appointed as General Secretary of the Labour Party.

Some of these productions were, or still are, in \\"development hell\\" in other mediums. Batman =Fleischer Studios' Batman= Following the success of the Fleischer Superman cartoons, Fleischer Studios communicated with DC Comics over the possibility of adapting Batman. The communication got to the point of budget discussions as illustrated in a letter dated January 25, 1942, and reproduced in longtime Batman executive producer, Michael E. Uslan's 2011 memoir, The Boy Who Loved Batman. It is, however, unknown how far the production of this project went before being abandoned. =CBS' Mike Henry Batman= Prior to the 1966 juggernaut that was the Adam West/Burt Ward Batman series, CBS attempted to launch a live action children's program based on the character. Former Rams linebacker and Tarzan actor Mike Henry was soon approached to appear as the character and even took publicity stills. The project went into limbo, and after a long stagnation, producers attempted to ironically sell it to NBC; they passed on the project in 1965. =Batman vs. Godzilla= The original idea for this seemingly mismatched crossover comes from the hand of series writer Shinichi Sekizawa, who submitted a manuscript of the proposal in November 1965. Sekizawa's concept featured several characters from the Batman universe, including Robin and Commissioner Gordon. To actually battle the King of the Monsters, Batman and his sidekicks would have utilized several vehicles to engage in combat, including the Batmobile, the Batcopter, and the Batcycle. Interesting to note, the concept also featured the introduction of a weather control apparatus, an idea which would later be worked into the script for Son of Godzilla (1967). It also was going to have another device to control Godzilla himself, which would possibly indicate another antagonist pitting the two characters against each other. In terms of Sekizawa's motivation, his reasoning seems clear in these drafts: to try and repeat the mammoth international success that the crossover film King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) enjoyed. This is made apparent in allusions to the earlier 1962 film, as even this extremely early take at the concept included mention of Godzilla's battle with King Kong, which was noted as being included with stock footage of the two titans fighting. Not surprisingly, though, the concept never got far enough for a full-fledged script to have been created. There are many questions related to the proposal still unknown as well, such as if DC Comics was ever actually approached with the idea or not. It is also not known to what degree the then-recent Batman TV series, which debuted two months after Sekizawa proposed this idea, might have played, if any. It is also interesting to note that references to \\"Batgirl\\" are made in the concept, which would predate the Barbara Gordon version of the character that would later become synonymous with the name in 1966. =Tim Burton Batman 3= During the early development of the cancelled Catwoman spin-off, Burton expressed his interest in directing the third installment of the Batman film series that began with Batman in 1989. The Monkees lead drummer Micky Dolenz was attached to star as the Riddler, the film's main antagonist. Also, Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face was supposed to occur in the film, with Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Dent from the first film, after turning down the offer to appear in Batman Returns. Along with these, Michelle Pfeiffer was attached to return as Catwoman, Marlon Wayans was attached to star as Robin, and Rene Russo was attached to star as Dr. Chase Meridian. However, when Warner Bros. observed that the script was just as gloomy as the previous film, they decided to put Joel Schumacher as the director of the third installment, leading to the release of Batman Forever, in which Burton served as producer, without being able to contribute ideas. =Joel Schumacher's Batman 5= =Batman: Year One live action film= =Batman: Assault on Arkham 2= In a 2016 interview, Jay Oliva mentioned that he had plans to make a sequel to Batman: Assault on Arkham. But following his departure from Warner Bros. Animation, the project may have been pulled. =Batman: The Musical= In 2002, Burton, Jim Steinman, and David Ives had worked on a theater production called Batman: The Musical. Steinman has revealed five songs from the musical. The first is the opening theme for \\"Gotham City\\" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo \\"The Graveyard Shift\\"; followed by \\"The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)\\", \\"The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)\\", \\"We're Still the Children We Once Were\\" (the climactic sequence) and \\"In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher is King\\", sung by the corrupt bloodsuckers ruling Gotham; the last song mentioned here was covered on the Meat Loaf album Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the Batman: The Musical memorial site.Dark Knight of the Soul =Bruce Wayne= =Gotham High= An animated series that reimagines Batman characters as high school students was in development in the late 2000s and early 2010s. A similar idea was used for the DC Super Hero Girls 2015 shorts and the 2019 animated series. =Batman: No Man's Land= =Batman: Arkham= After the success of Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero, Warner Bros. greenlighted the production of a third installment, entitled Batman: Arkham. Boyd Kirkland, the director of this film, was attached to write and direct. The film would have Batman and Robin facing off against a collection of Arkham Asylum escapees, in addition to Batman finding himself falling in love with a new love interest, planned to be voiced by Angie Harmon. The main cast of Batman: The Animated Series was attached to reprise their roles. Steven E. Gordon also drew some art concept for the film. However, the film was cancelled in favor of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (which also featured Harmon), while Batman: Arkham eventually became a successful video game series by Rocksteady. =The Batman vs. Hush= A second movie of The Batman titled The Batman vs. Hush that featured Hush as the main villain along with the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman and Clayface was planned for a long time. However, the film ended up being scrapped. Before its cancellation, producer Alan Burnett had hopes of making one or two more DTV movies based on The Batman.https://web.archive.org/web/20070128033428/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/thebatman/?x=backstage%2Finterviews%2Fburnett However, a film based on Batman: Hush ultimately came out in 2019 as part of the DC Animated Movie Universe. =Batman Beyond= Batman Beyond live action film Untitled Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker sequel A second Batman Beyond film was planned for release, but was finally scrapped due to the dark tones and controversies of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker in 2001. Untitled Batman Beyond animated film Timm has mentioned that a Batman Beyond film is a possibility, and in August 2017, Tucker stated in his Twitter account that discussions about a possible Batman Beyond film occur several times at the studio, =In the Batman Family= Robin A spin- off to Batman and Robin based on Robin was in the works, but was cancelled due to the critical and box office failure of the 1997 film. Batgirl: Year One Batman: Year One's executive producer Bruce Timm and co-director Lauren Montgomery expressed interest in producing an animated film based on Batgirl: Year One. But DC cancelled all plans for an adaptation. Nightwing: The Animated Series An animated series featuring Nightwing was in development from Ki Hyun Ryu of The Boondocks and The Legend of Korra fame. The series was rejected in favor for Young Justice. Catwoman: The Animated Series In the massive success of Batman: The Animated Series, Fox Kids approached Bruce Timm on making a spinoff based on Catwoman. The series was scrapped in favor of Superman: The Animated Series. Tim Burton's Catwoman spin-off Batman Returns would be the last film in the Warner Bros. Batman film series that featured Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor. With Batman Forever, Warner Bros. decided to go in a \\"lighter\\" direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer.Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, Joel Schumacher, The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight: Reinventing a Hero, 2005, Warner Home Video With Warner Bros. moving on development for Batman Forever in June 1993, a Catwoman spin-off was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in Forever because of her own spin-off. Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct Catwoman or an adaptation of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, \\"Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.\\" In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer reiterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry. Untitled direct-to-video Catwoman film Around 2003, during the production of Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, Warner Bros. approached Boyd Kirkland to write a Catwoman direct-to-video feature film as a tie-in with the 2004 live-action film. Although the script was written, the project was soon scrapped after the poor reception of the live action film. Direct-to-video Joker film In the year 2016, Batman: The Killing Joke screenwriter Brian Azzarello had stated that he would like to adapt his novel Joker into an animated film. =The Joker vs. the Powerpuff Girls= During the initial run of the Cartoon Network series The Powerpuff Girls, series creator Craig McCracken wanted to do a crossover episode featuring the Joker. On Tumblr, he said: Superman =Superman III: Supergirl= Producer Ilya Salkind originally wrote a treatment for the third installment from the Superman film series starring Christopher Reeve that expanded the film's scope to a cosmic scale, introducing the villains Brainiac and Mister Mxyzptlk, as well as Supergirl. The original outline featured a father‚Äìdaughter relationship between Brainiac and Supergirl and a romance between Superman and Supergirl, even though the two are cousins in the comics. Warner Bros. rejected the outline and made their own Superman III film. =Superman V= A sequel to the original Superman film series was in the works following Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. The film was cancelled due to the fact that Quest for Peace was a flop. =Superman Reborn= =Superman Lives= =Superman: Flyby= =Superman Returns sequel= = Untitled Superman spinoff series = In June 2006, during an interview about Superman: Brainiac Attacks, writer Duane Capizzi mentioned a Superman series set in the same universe of The Batman, a possibility supported by Superman's revealed existence during the show's fifth season. Despite this, the expansion was never realized, and Capizzi never again mentioned the spinoff. =Superman: Red Son live-action film= In 2017, Jordan Vogt-Roberts pitched a Red Son adaptation to Warner Brothers, as an \\"offshoot\\" of the DC Extended Universe with different actors for Superman and Batman, but \\"was told no.\\" Mark Millar responded by saying that two friends of his had been approached by WB to direct a live-action Red Son. There have been no further developments since. =In the Superman Family= The Adventures of Superboy TV pilot The Adventures of Superpup TV pilot Metropolis TV series In January 2018, Gotham producers John Stephens and Danny Cannon and Warner Bros. Television were reportedly given a 13-episode straight-to-series order for the DC Universe series Metropolis, which follows Lois Lane and Lex Luthor as they investigate the world of fringe science and expose the city‚Äôs dark and bizarre secrets. In May 2018, the series was being redeveloped. Untitled Superman Family animated series In May 2018, Vinton Heuck and Sean Galloway pitched an idea for a Superman Family animated series to Warner Bros. Animation but the pitch was rejected in favor of Harley Quinn animated series. Wonder Woman = Who's Afraid of Diana Prince TV pilot (1967) = A proposed 1967 television series, that only resulted in the production of a short pilot.Lauren Looks Back: Who‚Äôs Afraid Of Diana Prince? The Forgotten 1967 Wonder Woman TV Pilot The success of the Batman television series led Batman producer William Dozier to commission a pilot script by Stan Hart and Larry Siegel. Batman writer Stanley Ralph Ross was then asked to perform a re-write, after Hart and Siegel's script was deemed unsuitable. A portion of the pilot, under five minutes in length, was filmed by Greenway Productions, the company behind the Batman show under the title Who's Afraid of Diana Prince? The piece starred Ellie Wood Walker (Robert Walker Jr.'s wife) as Diana Prince, Linda Harrison as Diana's Wonder Woman alter ego and Maudie Prickett as Diana's mother. In the proposed series Diana Prince (not Wonder Woman) would have been the focus of the comedy. Diana, an awkward and rather plain young woman, lives with her mother close to a United States Air Force base. Much of the film consists of her mother berating Diana about not having a boyfriend. When her mother leaves the room, Diana changes into her Wonder Woman costume and admires her reflection in a mirror. What she sees is not Diana Prince, but rather a sexy super-heroic figure (played by Linda Harrison) who proceeds to preen and pose as the song \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" plays on the soundtrack. The pilot ends with Diana climbing out a window and flying away, indicating that, despite her apparent delusions regarding her alter ego, she does have some super powers. This pilot episode was never broadcast and the project was abandoned. = Wonder Woman TV pilot (2011) = A TV series based on Wonder Woman was in the works in 2010 that would have aired on NBC in 2011. =Early attempts of a Wonder Woman film= =Wonder Woman 2 (2011)= There were plans to make a sequel to the 2009 direct-to-video film Wonder Woman. It was cancelled due to poor DVD sales. =Filmation's Wonder Woman animated series= Animation studio Filmation considered making an animated series based on Wonder Woman in 1968 following the then-massive success of the TV series Batman. But nothing came out of it. =The CW's Amazon= In 2012, The CW, Warner Bros. Television and DC Comics announced that they were developing a new origin story for Wonder Woman called Amazon. In early 2013, the network pushed the pilot back until the 2014/15 season. On May 16, 2013, The CW announced that the show was still in development, with a new script by Aron Eli Coleite, replacing Allan Heinberg, who wrote the previous script for the planned pilot. However, in July 2013 The Flash, by Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg was fast-tracked instead. Mark Pedowitz confirmed that \\"Amazon is on pause (as) the script is not exactly what we wanted, and with an iconic character like Wonder Woman, we have to get it right.\\" In January 2014, Pedowitz told The Hollywood Reporter that the project was no longer in development: \\"We did not go forward with it [...] it all depends on the script. We were very careful with Arrow, and we're being very careful with Flash [...] these are iconic characters, so we're going to be very careful with Wonder Woman. You only get one shot before you get bit.\\" In August 2017, Pedowitz confirmed that the success of the feature film has killed any current attempts to bring the Amazonian warrior to the small screen on their channel. Justice League =George Miller's Justice League: Mortal= =Justice League of America= Early attempt at a Justice League series An early attempt at a Justice League television series was to feature lesser known superheroes, like the Question and Doctor Fate, that would have been part of the DC Animated Universe. The series was cancelled in favor of Batman Beyond. =Justice League: Worlds Collide= Circa 2004, Bruce Timm announced that a direct-to-video Justice League feature film was in the works. The film was intended to make a bridge between the second season of Justice League to the first season of Justice League Unlimited. The film was planned to reveal how Wonder Woman acquired her Invisible-Jet, and also planned to feature the Crime Syndicate as the main antagonists, an idea that was originally conceived for the two-part episode \\"A Better World\\", until the Syndicate was replaced by the Justice Lords.

It has two or three leaves at its base and up to five bright yellow and mauve flowers described as \\"exquisite\\", \\"spectacular\\" and \\"attractive\\". It grows in shallow soil on granite outcrops near Esperance. Description Diuris pulchella is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three linear to lance-shaped leaves, each leaf long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to five bright yellow flowers with mauve, green and white markings, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forwards near its base then curves upwards and is egg-shaped to kidney-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, green with purplish markings, long, about wide and turned downwards. The petals are more or less erect with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a greenish mauve stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped to more or less round or kidney-shaped, wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There is a single yellow, ridge-like callus occupying about one-third of the length of the labellum near its base. Flowering occurs in August and September. Taxonomy and naming Diuris pulchella was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Mount Ney Nature Reserve, and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (pulchella) is the diminutive form of the Latin word pulcher meaning \\"beautiful\\" hence \\"beautiful little\\", referring to the \\"highly colourful and attractive flowers\\". Other authors have described the flowers as \\"exquisite\\" or \\"spectacular\\". Distribution and habitat The beautiful donkey orchid grows usually in shallow soil on and around granite outcrops and is found between Salmon Gums, Esperance and Balladonia in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Diuris pulchella is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia).

III, p. 700 (\\"Salonius\\"). Origin The nomen Salonius belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed from words ending in -o, using the suffix '. The root of the name is salo, a salt-dealer, from sal, salt, and indicates that an ancestor of the Salonii was probably a dealer in salt, one of the most important commodities of antiquity.Chase, p. 119. Members * Publius Salonius, military tribune in 342 BC, had been either tribune or centurion primus pilus for several consecutive years. The dictator Marcus Valerius Corvus, in settling a mutiny, agreed to the soldiers' demand that nobody who had been military tribune should subsequently become a centurion, as Salonius had opposed their actions. The senate initially rejected this concession, but agreed when Salonius himself urged its passage in the interests of harmony.Livy, vii. 41.Broughton, vol. I, p. 134. * Gaius Salonius, one of the commissioners appointed to establish a colony at Tempsa in Bruttium in 194 BC.

suitcase for use in medical clinics in the developing world. She is also the mother of actor and singer Ari'el Stachel. Education and early life Laura Stachel was brought up in the Boston area. She earned her undergraduate degree at Oberlin College, earned her medical degree at University of California, San Francisco in 1985, and in 2006 earned a master's in public health from UC Berkeley. Career Stachel practiced as an ob/gyn doctor after finishing medical school, but in 2002 pain from degeneration in the vertebrae in her neck forced her to quit delivering babies and eventually to leave clinical medicine. She went back to school to earn a masters in public health and began lecturing at UC Berkeley. In 2008, while studying for her doctorate, she traveled to Nigeria to study what rates of maternal mortality were so high. During that time she witnessed how lack of electricity directly affected health outcomes for women and infants during childbirth. Her husband, Hal Aronson, was creating solar education programs in the San Francisco Bay area. She asked if he could design a system that would target areas of the Nigerian hospital most important for maternal health. The solar electric system he created for the maternity ward, labor room, operating theater, and laboratory, helped the hospital achieve a 70% drop in maternal mortality the next year. Surrounding clinics began to ask for solar power, and Hal designed solar power for ob/gyn clinics in the developing world. Aronson designed a system the size of a suitcase to allow Laura to transport these to Africa. The Solar Suitcase had solar panels to be removed and mounted on the roof, a charge controller, a 12-volt battery, LED lights, and multiple outlets; the \\"Solar Suitcase\\" was eventually further developed to include phone chargers, a fetal monitor, and customized long-lasting LED lights. Stachel brought the first one back to Nigeria in 2009 and the clinic asked to keep it. Hal and Laura received further help from an engineer, Brent Moellenberg, and support from Bay area solar companies Everbright Solar and Holly Solar Products, to perfect the design and work out the manufacturing. The couple established a nonprofit, We Care Solar (formally WE CARE ‚Äî an acronym for Women's Emergency Communication and Reliable Electricity), and it received its IRS nonprofit ruling in 2011. The couple at first built the solar devices in their garage and backyard. They sought ways to fund it; Stachel competed in a technology for social good competition in 2009, earning only an \\"honorable mention,\\" but one of the judges connected them with the Blum Center for Developing Economies at UC Berkeley which provided the nonprofit with office space and financial support. In 2010 the nonprofit received an order from WHO for 20 devices in clinics in Liberia, and received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation, allowing them pilot Solar Suitcases in Nigeria and Uganda and to hire an engineer. Stachel entered several more social entrepreneurship business competitions and received mentoring and scholarships to understand how to run nonprofit. Over the next few years, We Care Solar built a team of finance, programmatic, and engineering staff. By 2019, according to Stachel, there were more than 4,000 Solar Suitcases installed in more than 20 countries, and We Care Solar had worked with 45 other NGOs and UN agencies to serve more than 1.9 million mothers.interview with Laura Stachel, Nov 3, 2019  References  Category:American women physicians Category:Living people Category:People from Boston Category:University of California, San Francisco alumni Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American social entrepreneurs ","title":"Laura Stachel"},{"id":"57025242","text":"Tomb Effigy of Jacquelin de Ferri√®re The Tomb Effigy of Jacquelin de Ferri√®re is usually on display in the Medieval Art Gallery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The effigy is of the French knight, Sir Jacquelin de Ferri√®re, who was from Montargis, near Sens in northern France. The effigy is dated between 1275-1300 CE. It is long, wide, and deep, and carved into a flat limestone slab, which now has a wooden frame. Effigies were often commissioned by the nobles or their families, as a means of remembrance. They would normally be found covering the sarcophagi of the knight, or installed in or near a church that the family were patrons of. Although the inscription on this effigy is not clear, most effigies contained similar inscriptions that would include the name and title, dates of birth and death‚Äìor approximates, a link between the date of death and a notable holy figure or day, and petitions of prayer that would offer pardons to those that prayed for the depicted soul‚Äìlargely an attempt to create a tangible link between the nobility and divinity.  Noble ideals  The age and imagery of this effigy, and most others during this period, represent the ideals of nobility during the 13th century as they wanted to be remembered. It was important for knights to be remembered as religious, of certain social status, and conforming to ideas of gender. This is why many are depicted as armed and armored, with heraldry and symbolic imagery included. These images were highly stylized and idealized, and rarely represented what the actual person looked like, instead portraying what a knight was expected to look like. The age of representation was also important. Although Jacquelin de Ferri√®re died while older, he is depicted, as most nobles during this period, around the age of thirty three. This age not only represented the ideal age of knights, but was also the supposed age of Jesus Christ when he was crucified.  Imagery  = Chainmail = Chainmail was the prominent form of armor during the 13th century. A precursor to plate armor, chainmail protected its wearer from opponents while allowing mobility, and was extremely effective against edged weapons and thrust attacks. = Shield = The shield was an important part of a knight's armament. While chainmail offered protection against thrusting and edged attacks, it offered little protection against the force blunt strike from a sword or lance. The long, tapered shield offered the knight's body protection from forceful blows while on horseback or on foot. The shield was also a place for knights to signify their loyalty or identity with displays of heraldry. On the shield of Jacquelin de Ferri√®re, horseshoes can be seen across the top of the shield. = Sword = The sword depicted is unique from other swords of this period. \\"Thirteenth-century pommels mostly had the shape either of a disk or a more or less pointed oval... If in an exceptional case, such as the sword on the incised tomb slab of Jaquelin de Ferriere, a trilobate pom- mel can be found, it is clearly only a scalloped variant of the disk-shaped pommel and is invariably associated with a guard of long, straight quillons.\\" = Spurs = When a squire became a knight, a formal ceremony would take place to welcome the newly dubbed knight. This would include an all night prayer vigil, the girding‚Äìor hanging of his sword, a blow to the cheek from the flat part of the sword by an elder, and the bestowal of his spurs. In iconography, the spurs distinguished the noble knights from other armored soldiers, such as infantrymen. = Iconography = The horseshoes on the shield are an example of puns in heraldry. The pun lies within the last name, Ferri√®re, which is a derivative of farrier, or a smith who shoes horses. Animals were often included symbolically on effigies in the Late Middle Ages. In this effigy, two dogs can be seen flanking Jacquelin de Ferri√®re. The dog mostly symbolized loyalty and faithfulness, letting those who would see the effigy that person accompanied by the dogs was faithful and loyal to his family, religion, and liege lord.

It is located on Rua Nova in the historic center of Recife and is under the administration of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1941. History The Recife Infantry Regiment (Ter√ßo da Vila de Santo Ant√¥nio do Recife), which included officers, sergeants and squares of the Corps of Execution and Cavalry, organized a Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military in the early 18th century. Under the command of Jo√£o Lobo de Lacerda they requested permission to construct a church dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception on March 19, 1725. Some evidence dates to the beginning of construction of the church to 1710. It was completed in 1771. Construction of the church was authorized by Ant√¥nio Fernandes de Matos. It features a simple, severe fa√ßade, in contrast to its richly decorated interior. The structures lacks a churchyard. It is constructed of heavy stonework, a single tower, and Rococo pediment. The interior walls are richly decorated with baroque carving. The vault of the chancel is notably complex. It consists of a crossed arch with two side altars as typical of the period of King Jo√£o V. The ceiling of the nave is a style associated with Nicolau Nasoni and Andr√© Soares, a sculptor, of northern Portugal. The length of the nave has a carved veranda; it is the only example of this type of construction in Recife. The ceiling of the name is richly painted with themes associated with the life of the Virgin Mary. The paintings of the church depict elements atypical and possibly prohibited by the Church of the period, including homunculus of Jesus Christ on the breast of the Virgin Mary. A painting depicting the Battle of Guararapes is located in the lower choir. It was commissioned by Governor Jos√© C√©sar de Meneses, and attributed to Jo√£o de Deus Sep√∫lveda. The central painting of the Virgin is attributed to Jos√© Rabelo Gon√ßalves. The church remains under the management of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military. Protected status The Church of Our Lady of the Conception of the Military was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1941. The heritage designation includes both the church and the Summer Palace of the Archbishop. The structures were registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 4-T and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fl 53. Both directives are dated September 25, 1941.

Artistic endeavors In 2006, while developing his own designs and teaching at ISDI, Raupa was asked to develop the visual art works for La Casa del las Americas, an important Cuban cultural center founded after the 1959 revolution. This center's objectives are to investigate, sponsor, reward and publish the work of writers, musicians, theater players and other artists from Cuba. Raupa continues to handle all the visual artwork for this institution and has staged solo and group exhibitions at the center including ‚Äì * Comikazes. Group exhibition of comics and costume design, Casa de las Americas, 2008. * Taken House. Meeting of young American writers and artists, Casa de las Americas, 2009. * Audiovisual sample Cubanos, Casa de las Americas, 2010. * Prize Exhibition House: Five Decades. Casa de las Americas. January, 2011. Raupa continued creating his graphic images for the 6th to 13th Festivals of New Filmmakers of the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC) from 2007 until 2012. In association with ICAIC, he also designed the posters for the film ‚Äú7 Days in Havana‚Äù, a contemporary snapshot of Havana shot in seven chapters directed by seven international filmmakers. In 2017, Raupa was chosen to create the complete graphic design program for the 39th Latin American Film Festival Campaign. Using a blue green and red coral that is literally growing out of the poster, his design represented the theme of the festival ‚Äì the growth of the Cuban and Latin American Film industry. The same year, in conjunction with the Pratt Institute and the American Museum of Natural History's exhibition ¬°Cuba!, Raupa demonstrated the art of screen printing in a two-day mobile workshop that concluded with a guest lecture at Pratt. All participants were able to take home a poster of their own design. The endeavor was co-funded by the Cuban Initiative Fund and Pratt's School of Art in order to foster cultural exchange initiatives between the U.S. and Cuba. Raupa has created the titles and promotional posters for various Cuban films including Penumbras, 2011, The Broken Gods Los Dioses Rotos, 2007, Kangamba, 2007, Behavior Conducta 2013 and Sergio y Sergei, as well as for the music program on Cuban television Floor 6. In addition, he has designed visual images for The Embassy of Italy and Belgium in Cuba and the 2009 St. Louis USA Shakespeare Festival. He served as the art director for Havana Cultura.com as well as for HAVANA Club International - a Cuban rum company formed by a 50:50 joint venture between Pernod Ricard and the Cuban government. His current project for Havana Club consists of directing four commercials about creating their premium Iconica rum. Exhibitions and collaborations In 2007, Raupa's solo exhibition titled \\"Spotsition\\", offered more than 20 original visual works at the Centre for Development of Visual Arts in Cuba. The exhibition theme was The Spots of Public Good. Besides his solo exhibitions, Raupa has contributed to various exhibitions highlighting graphic arts. In 2012, Yale University sponsored an artists' reception for the exhibit \\"Posters From an Island - 4 Artists of Cuba,\\" which featured his works along with three other Cuban Artists. Raupa's works were displayed at the 2015 Festival Expo at the Front Art Space Gallery in New York, a collection of posters showcasing Cuban films. The same year, he was one of the graphic artists featured in Cuba a la Vista at the Besan√ßon Museum of Fine Arts in France. This exhibition featured a wide range of Cuban posters from the 1960s until today. Raupa is a member of a group of five Cuban designers and friends called Nocturnal that work together to design posters and produce exhibitions for commercial and artistic concerns. Since no commercial advertising is allowed in Cuba, their commercial endeavors are for clients outside of Cuba.

After he grew too large for flying, Gilmore accompanied Turner in publicity appearances for the next ten years. Gilmore was born on February 7, 1930, at Goebel's Wild Animal Farm ‚Äì a theme park and supplier of animals for Hollywood movies. The lion was sponsored by and named after the Gilmore Oil Company, whose icon was a red lion with the slogan \\"Roar with Gilmore\\". The company gave Turner $15,000 to buy the lion and a plane that was decorated to advertise Gilmore Oil. The Humane Society petitioned Turner to equip Gilmore with a parachute, which also resulted in enhancing the image of a \\"flying lion\\". After he grew too large for flying, Gilmore accompanied Turner to publicity appearances over the next ten years. During a brief eight-month period, Gilmore logged over 25,000 miles in the air and was a passenger during multiple air speed record runs. When not flying, Gilmore made public appearances including at the golf course and disconcerted the mailman and other visitors to Turner's home when he answered the door. Once he reached in weight and had outgrown the cockpit and his parachute, he was kept at the airport in Burbank, California (then known as the United Airport), and a Gilmore Oil service station in Beverly Hills until around 1940. He spent his last decade at the World Jungle Compound, where Turner continued to pay for his food and visited him, and died on December 17, 1950.
