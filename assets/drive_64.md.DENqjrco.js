Fired up by Kharijite puritan preachers, the Berber revolt against their Umayyad Arab rulers began in Tangiers in 740, and was led initially by Maysara al-Matghari. The revolt soon spread through the rest of the Maghreb (North Africa) and across the straits to al-Andalus. The Umayyads scrambled and managed to prevent the core of Ifriqiya (Tunisia, East-Algeria and West- Libya) and al-Andalus (Spain and Portugal) from falling into rebel hands. But the rest of the Maghreb was never recovered. After failing to capture the Umayyad provincial capital of Kairouan, the Berber rebel armies dissolved, and the western Maghreb fragmented into a series of small Berber statelets, ruled by tribal chieftains and Kharijite imams. The Berber revolt was probably the largest military setback in the reign of Caliph Hisham. From it, emerged some of the first Muslim states outside the Caliphate. It is sometimes also regarded as the beginning of Moroccan independence, as Morocco would never again come under the rule of an eastern Caliph or any other foreign power until the 20th century. Background The underlying causes of the revolt were the policies of the Umayyad governors in Kairouan, Ifriqiya, who had authority over the Maghreb (all of North Africa west of Egypt) and al-Andalus. From the early days of the Muslim conquest of North Africa, Arab commanders had treated non-Arab (notably Berber) auxiliaries inconsistently, and often rather shabbily. When they arrived in North Africa the Umayyads had to face a Christian-majority population in Africa Proconsularis (which became Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia) and pagans in the Maghreb al-Aqsa (now Morocco) with Jewish minorities. Some Berbers of the Maghreb quickly converted and participated in the growth of Islam in the region, but the Arab authorities continued to treat them as second-class people. Although Berbers had undertaken much of the fighting in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, they were given a lesser share of the spoils and frequently assigned to the harsher duties (e.g. Berbers were thrown into the vanguard while Arab forces were kept in the back; they were assigned garrison duty on the more troubled frontiers). Although the Ifriqiyan Arab governor Musa ibn Nusair had cultivated his Berber lieutenants (most famously, Tariq ibn Ziyad), his successors, notably Yazid ibn Abi Muslim, had treated their Berber forces particularly poorly.Dhannun Taha (1989: 198) Most grievously, Arab governors continued to levy extraordinary dhimmi taxation (the jizyah and kharaj) and slave-tributes on non-Arab populations that had converted to Islam, in direct contravention of Islamic law. This had become particularly routine during the caliphates of Walid I and Sulayman. In 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar II finally forbade the levying of extraordinary taxation and slave tributes from non-Arab Muslims, defusing much of the tension. But expensive military reverses in the 720s and 730s had forced caliphal authorities to look for innovative ways to replenish their treasuries. During the caliphate of Hisham from 724, the prohibitions were sidestepped with reinterpretations (e.g. tying the kharaj land tax to the land rather than the owner, so that lands that were at any point subject to the kharaj remained under kharaj even if currently owned by a Muslim). As a result, resentful Berbers grew receptive to radical Kharijite activists from the east (notably of Sufrite and later Ibadite persuasion) which had begun arriving in the Maghreb in the 720s. The Kharijites preached a puritan form of Islam, promising a new political order, where all Muslims would be equal, irrespective of ethnicity or tribal status, and Islamic law would be strictly adhered to. The appeal of the Kharijite message to Berber ears allowed their activists to gradually penetrate Berber regiments and population centers. Sporadic mutinies by Berber garrisons (e.g. under Munnus in Cerdanya, Spain, in 729-31) were put down with difficulty. One Ifriqiyan governor, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim, who openly resumed the jizya and humiliated his Berber guard by branding their hands, was assassinated in 721. In 734, Ubayd Allah ibn al- Habhab was appointed Umayyad governor in Kairouan, with supervisory authority over all the Maghreb and al-Andalus. Coming in after a period of mismanagement, Ubayd Allah soon set about expanding the fiscal resources of the government by leaning heavily on the non-Arab populations, resuming the extraordinary taxation and slave-tribute without apologies. His deputies Oqba ibn al-Hajjaj al-Saluli in C√≥rdoba (Al-Andalus) and Omar ibn el-Moradi in Tangier (Maghreb) were given similar instructions. The failure of expensive expeditions into Gaul during the period 732-737, repulsed by the Franks under Charles Martel, only increased the tax burden. The parallel failure of the caliphal armies in the east brought no fiscal relief from Damascus.  The Revolt  = Revolt in the Maghreb = The zeal of the Umayyad tax-collectors finally broke Berber patience. It is reported that following Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab's instructions to extract more revenues from the Berbers, Omar ibn al-Moradi, his deputy governor in Tangiers, decided to declare the Berbers in his jurisdiction a \\"conquered people\\" and consequently set about seizing Berber property and enslaving persons, as per the rules of conquest, the \\"caliphal fifth\\" was still owed to the Umayyad state (alternative accounts report he simply doubled their tribute). This was the last straw. Inspired by the Sufrite preachers, the North African Berber tribes of western Morocco ‚Äì initially, the Ghomara, Berghwata and Miknasa ‚Äì decided to break openly into revolt against their Arab overlords. As their leader, they chose Maysara al- Matghari, alleged by some Arab chroniclers to be a lowly water-carrier (but more probably a high Matghara Berber chieftain). The only question was timing. The opportunity arose sometime in late 739 or early 740 (122 AH), when the powerful Ifriqiyan general Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri, who had recently been imposing his authority on the Sous valley of southern Morocco, received instructions from the Kairouan governor Ubayd Allah to lead a large expedition across the sea against Byzantine Sicily. Gathering his forces, Habib ibn Abi Obeida marched the bulk of the Ifriqiyan army out of Morocco. As soon as the mighty Habib was safely gone, Maysara assembled his coalition of Berber armies, heads shaven in the Sufri Kharijite fashion and with Qura'nic inscriptures tied to their lances and spears, and brought them bearing down on Tangiers. The city soon fell into rebel hands and the hated governor Omar al- Moradi was killed. It was at this point that Maysara is said to have taken up the title and pretences of amir al-mu'minin (\\"Commander of the Faithful\\", or \\"Caliph\\"). Leaving a Berber garrison in Tangier under the command of Christian convert, Abd al-Allah al-Hodeij al-Ifriqi, Maysara's army proceeded to sweep down western Morocco, swelling its ranks with new adherents, overwhelming Umayyad garrisons clear from the Straits down to the Sous. One of the local governors killed by the Berbers was Ismail ibn Ubayd Allah, the very son of the Kairouan emir.Ibn Khaldun, p.216-17 The Berber revolt surprised the Umayyad governor in Kairouan, Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab, who had very few troops at his disposal. He immediately dispatched messengers to his general Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri in Sicily instructing him to break off the expedition and urgently ship the Ifriqiyan army back to Africa. In the meantime, Ubayd Allah assembled a cavalry-heavy column, composed of the aristocratic Arab elite of Kairouan. He placed the nobles under the command of Khalid ibn Abi Habib al-Fihri, and dispatched it to Tangiers, to keep the Berber rebels contained, while awaiting Habib's return from Sicily. A smaller reserve army was placed under Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Mughira al-Abdari and instructed to hold Tlemcen, in case the Berber rebel army should break through the column and try to drive towards Kairouan. Maysara's Berber forces encountered the vanguard Ifrqiyan column of Khalid ibn Abi Habib somewhere in the outskirts of Tangiers Following Ibn Khaldun (p.217), commentators usually mark that encounter at the Chelif river (in Algeria). However, it is unlikely that the Berber rebels would have reached that far east so soon. It is likely Ibn Khaldun or his transcribers confused that location with a similar-sounding one, closer to Tangiers. Julien (1961: p.30) suggests it was in the upper reaches of the Sebou river. After a brief skirmish with the Arab column, Maysara abruptly ordered the Berber armies to fall back to Tangier. The Arab cavalry commander Khalid ibn Abi Habiba did not give pursuit, but just held his line south of Tangier, blockading the Berber-held city, while awaiting the reinforcements from Habib's Sicilian expedition. In this breathing space, the Berber rebels got reorganized and undertook an internal coup. The Berber tribal leaders swiftly deposed (and executed) Maysara and elected the Zenata Berber chieftain, Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati as the new Berber \\"caliph\\". The reasons for Maysara's fall remain obscure. Possibly the sudden cowardice shown before the Arab cavalry column proved him military unfit, possibly because the puritan Sufrite preachers found a flaw in the piety of his character, or maybe simply because the Zenata tribal chieftains, being closer to the Ifriqiyan frontline, felt they should be the ones leading the rebellion. The new Berber leader Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati opted to immediately attack the idling Ifriqiyan column before they could be reinforced. The Berber rebels under Khalid ibn Hamid overwhelmed and annihilated the Arab cavalry of Khalid ibn Abi Habiba in an encounter known as the Battle of the Nobles, on account of the veritable massacre of the cream of the Ifriqiyan Arab nobility. This is tentatively dated around c. October‚ÄìNovember, 740. The immediate Arab reaction to the disaster shows just how unexpected this reversal was. Upon the first news of the defeat of the nobles, the reserve army of Ibn al-Mughira in Tlemcen fell into a panic. Seeing Sufrite preachers everywhere in the city, the Umayyad commander ordered his nervous Arab troops to conduct a series of round-ups in Tlemcen, several of which ended in indiscriminate massacres. This provoked a massive popular uprising in the hitherto-quiet city. The city's largely Berber population quickly drove out the Umayyad troops. The frontline of the Berber revolt now leaped to the middle Maghreb (Algeria).Blankinship (1994, p.208) The Sicilian expeditionary army of Habib ibn Abi Obeida arrived too late to prevent the massacre of the nobles. Realizing they were in no position to take on the Berber army by themselves, they retreated to Tlemcen, to gather the reserves, only to find that city too was now in disarray. There, Habib encountered Musa ibn Abi Khalid, an Umayyad captain who had bravely stayed behind in the vicinity of Tlemcen gathering what loyal forces he could find. The state of panic and confusion was such that Habib ibn Abi Obeida decided to blame the guiltless captain for the entire mess and cut off one of his hands and one of his legs in punishment. Habib ibn Abi Obeida entrenched what remained of the Ifriqiyan army in the vicinity of Tlemcen (perhaps as far back as Tahert), and called upon Kairouan for reinforcements. The request was forwarded to Damascus. Caliph Hisham, hearing the shocking news, is said to have exclaimed: \\"By God, I will most certainly rage against them with an Arab rage, and I will send against them an army whose beginning is where they are and whose end is where I am!\\" Blankinship, 1994:p.209 = Coup in al-Andalus = It is sometimes reported that the Andalusian governor Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj dispatched an Andalusian army across the straits to support the Ifriqiyan column around Tangiers, only to be similarly defeated by the Berber rebels in late 740. But this story has been discounted by modern historians, as it is sourced principally from later al-Andalus chronicles; there is nothing in contemporary accounts referencing any such expedition. Nonetheless, the news of the Berber victory in Morocco echoed through al-Andalus. Berbers heavily outnumbered Arabs in al-Andalus. Fearing the Berber garrisons in their own lands might take inspiration from their Moroccan brethren, the Andalusian Arab elite quickly deposed Obeid Allah's deputy, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj, in January 741 and reinstated his predecessor, Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri, a more popular figure among local Arabs and Berbers alike.Blankinship, 1994: p.209. =The Syrian Expedition= In February, 741, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham appointed Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi to replace the disgraced Obeid Allah as governor in Ifriqiya. Kulthum was to be accompanied by a fresh Arab army of 30,000 ‚Äì 27,000 raised from the regiments (junds) of SyriaSpecifically, the 27,000 Syrian troops were composed of 6,000 men from each of the four main Syrian junds of Jund Dimashq (Damascus), Jund Hims (Homs), Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan), and Jund Filastin (Palestine), plus 3,000 from Jund Qinnasrin and an additional 3,000 to be picked up in Egypt.Dozy, Reinhart (1913) Spanish Islam: A History of the Muslims in Spain (translated by Francis Griffin Stokes from the Spanish Histoire de Musulmans d'Espagne) Chatto & Windus, London, page 133, Caliph Hisham appointed Kulthum's nephew Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri as his lieutenant and designated successor, and the Jordanian commander Thalaba ibn Salama al-Amili as his second successor (should tragedy befall the prior two). The elite Syrian cavalry under Balj ibn Bishr, which had moved ahead of the bulk of the forces, was the first to arrive in Kairouan in the Summer of 741. Their brief stay was not a happy one. The Syrians arrived in haughty spirits and quarreled with the Kairouan city authorities, who suspicious, had given them a rather cool reception. Interpreting it as ingratitude, the Syrian barons imposed themselves on the city, billeting troops and requisitioning supplies without regard to local authorities or priorities. (It is pertinent to note that the members of the Syrian expedition were of different tribal stock than the Arabs they came to save. The early Arab colonists of Ifriqiya and al-Andalus had been drawn largely from tribes of south Arabian origin (known as Kalbid or 'Yemenite' tribes), whereas the Syrian junds were mostly of north Arabian tribes (Qaysid or Mudharite, or 'Syrian' tribes). The ancient and deep pre-Islamic tribal rivalry between Qaysid and Yemenite found itself invoked in repeated quarrels between the earlier colonists and the arriving junds.) Moving slower with the bulk of the forces, Kulthum ibn Iyad himself did not enter Kairouan, but merely dispatched a message assigning the government of the city to Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari, the qadi of Ifriqiya. Collecting the Syrian vanguard, Kulthum hurried along to make junction with the remaining Ifriqiyan forces (some 40,000) of Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri holding ground in the vicinity of Tlemcen. The junction between the North African and Eastern forces did not go smoothly.Blankinship, p.211 News of the Syrian misbehavior in Kairouan had reached the Ifriqiyan troops, while the Syrians, incensed at the poor reception, treated their Ifriqiyan counterparts in a high-handed fashion. Habib and Balj bickered and the armies nearly came to blows. By smooth diplomacy, Kulthum ibn Iyad managed hold the armies together, but the mutual resentments would play a role in subsequent events. The Berber rebel army, under the leadership of Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati (perhaps jointly with a certain Salim Abu Yusuf al-Azdi ), while boasting great numbers (some 200,000), were very poorly equipped. Many Berber fighters had nothing but stones and knives, dressed in a mere loin cloth, heads shaved in puritan fashion. But they made up for this in knowledge of the terrain, excellent morale, and a fanatical Sufrite-inspired religious fervor. The Berber and Arab armies finally clashed at the Battle of Bagdoura (or Baqdura) in October-November, 741, by the Sebou river (near modern Fes). Disdaining the experience and cautious advice of the Ifriqiyans, Kulthum ibn Iyad made several serious tactical errors. Berber skirmishers dehorsed and isolated the Syrian cavalry, while the Berber foot fell upon the Arab infantry with overwhelming numbers. The Arab armies were quickly routed. By some estimates, two-thirds of the Arab army were killed or captured by the Berbers at Bagdoura.Blankinship, p.212 Among the casualties were the new governor Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi and the Ifriqiyan commander Habib ibn Abi Obeida al- Fihri. The Syrian regiments, now reduced to some 10,000, were pulled together by Kulthum's nephew, Balj ibn Bishr and scrambled up towards the straits, where they hoped to get passage across the water to al-Andalus. A small Ifriqiyan contingent, under Habib's son Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri, joined the Syrians in their flight, but the rest of the Ifriqiyan forces fled in a scattered way back to Kairouan. The bulk of the Berber rebel army set off in pursuit of the Syrians, and laid siege to them in Ceuta. = Offensive on Kairouan = The Zenata Berber leader Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati who delivered the two great victories over the Arab armies disappears from the chronicles shortly after Bagdoura (741).Fournel (1857: p.79) But news of the defeat emboldened hitherto quiet Berber tribes to join the revolt. Berber uprisings erupted across the Maghreb and al-Andalus. The most immediate threat arose in southern Ifriqiya, where the Sufrite leader Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari raised a Berber army and laid sieges to Gab√®s and Gafsa. By a rapid sally south with the remnant of the Ifriqiyan army, the Kairouan qadi Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari managed to defeat and disperse Oqasha's forces near Gafsa in December, 741.Blankship, p.215 But the qadi possessed far too few Arab troops to put up a pursuit, and Oqasha immediately set about re-assembling his forces quietly around Tobna in the Zab valley of western Ifriqiya. Immediately after hearing of the disaster at Bagdoura, the Caliph Hisham ordered the Umayyad governor of Egypt, Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi, to quickly take charge of Ifriqiya. In February 742, Handhala ibn Safwan hurried his Egyptian army westwards and reached Kairouan around April 742, just as Oqasha was returning to try his luck again. Handhala's forces pushed Oqasha back again. When Oqasha was reassembling his forces once more in the Zab, he came across a large Berber army coming from the west, under the command of the Hawwara Berber chieftain Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari (possibly dispatched by the Berber caliph Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati, although he is not mentioned in the chronicles). Abd al-Wahid's army was composed of some 300,000 Berber troops, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen.Ibn Khaldun (1857: p.363); Fournel (1857: p.79) After a quick consultation, Oqasha and Abd al-Wahid agreed on a joint attack on Kairouan, Oqasha taking his forces along a southerly route, while Abd al-Wahid led his large army through the northern passes, converging on Kairouan from both sides. Hearing of the approach of the great Berber armies, Handhala ibn Safwan realized it was paramount to prevent their junction. Dispatching a cavalry force to harass and slow down Abd al- Wahid in the north, Handhala threw the bulk of his forces south, crushing Oqasha in a bloody battle at El-Qarn and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al- Wahid's gigantic army. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at El-Asnam around May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000-180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter. Oqasha was executed shortly after. Although Kairouan was saved for the caliphate, and with it the core of Ifriqiya, Handhala ibn Safwan now faced the unenviable task of dragging the more westerly provinces, still under Berber sway, back into the fold. He would not have the chance to accomplish this. = Revolt in al-Andalus = Military campaigns in northeastern al-Andalus and southern Gaul at the time of the Berber Revolt (739‚Äì742) The coup installing Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri as ruler in al-Andalus in early 741 had been a failsafe device. But once the news of the disaster at Bagdoura spread, a general Berber uprising in al-Andalus could no longer be prevented. In October 741, Berber garrisons north of the Douro River mutinied. They discarded their Arab commanders and took to the field, abandoning their garrison posts to assemble their own Berber rebel army around the center and march against the Andalusian Arabs in the south. Although their leaders' names have escaped us, the Andalusian Berber rebel army was organized into three columns ‚Äì one to take Toledo (the main garrison city of the central march), another to aim for C√≥rdoba (the Umayyad capital), and the third to take Algeciras, where the rebels hoped to seize the Andalusian fleet to ferry additional Berber troops from North Africa. With the frontier garrisons in the northwest suddenly evacuated, the Christian king Alfonso I of Asturias could hardly believe his luck, and set about dispatching Asturian troops to seize the empty forts. With remarkable swiftness and ease the northwest was captured, and the banks of the upper Ebro were raided by Alfonso and permanently lost to al-Andalus. The Asturians devastated several towns and villages on the banks of the Douro River, and carried off local populations from the towns and villages in the Galician-Leonese lowlands back to the mountains, creating an empty buffer zone in the Douro River valley (the Desert of the Duero) between the Asturias in the north and al-Andalus in the south. This newly emptied frontier would remain in place for the next few centuries. It is alleged that pastoral Berber mountaineers remained behind in the highlands around Astorga and Le√≥n. These trapped Berber communities were called \\"Maragatos\\" by the local Christian Leonese (etymology uncertain, possibly from mauri capti, \\"captive Moors\\"). Although eventually converted to Christianity, the Maragatos retained their distinctive dress, customs and lifestyle of Berber origin down to the early modern era. = The Syrians in Al-Andalus = Through much of the winter of 741-42, the remnant of the Syrian expedition, some 10,000 men, under Balj ibn Bishr, remained trapped in Ceuta, besieged by the Berber rebels. The Andalusian ruler Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al- Fihri, wary that the presence of the Syrians in Al-Andalus would only aggravate matters, refused them passage across the water. Indeed, he forbade any relief of the stranded Syrians, going so far as to publicly torture to death an Andalusian merchant who had dared to dispatch a couple of grain boats to Ceuta to feed the desperate Syrians.al-Maqqari (1840-43, v.2, p.41), Mercier (1888: p.234); But news soon reached the Andalusian governor that the Berber rebel armies from the northwest had been organized and were now barreling south in three columns, towards Toledo, C√≥rdoba and Algeciras. Not having enough Arab forces at hand, the Andalusian governor Abd al-Malik realized he had little choice but to make use of the stranded Syrian force to defeat the Berber armies. In a carefully negotiated treaty, Abd al-Malik granted the Syrians permission to cross over, on the condition that they promise to return to North Africa within a year of the settlement of the Berber matter in Al-Andalus. Hostages were taken to secure Syrian compliance. The Syrian junds under Balj ibn Bishr crossed the straits in early 742 and immediately headed to the environs of Medina-Sidonia, where they intercepted and disposed of the Berber column aiming for Algeciras. The Syrians then joined the Andalusian Arabs in crushing the main Berber rebel army in a ferocious battle outside of C√≥rdoba in the Spring of 742. Shortly after, they proceeded to defeat the third Berber army, then laying siege to Toledo. The Berber rebellion was quashed in Al-Andalus, but the Syrians showed no signs of intending to leave. When the Andalusian governor Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan ibn Fihri pressed the point, Balj ibn Bishr, decided to simply depose him and proclaim himself governor, invoking his credentials as designated successor to his uncle, the late Ifriqiyan governor Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi. In revenge for the merchant of Ceuta, Balj ordered the elderly Ibn Qatan tortured to death. A civil war was not short in happening. Rallied by Qatan and Umayya, the sons of the late Fihrid governor, Andalusian Arabs took up arms against the Syrian junds. The Syrians delivered a decisive defeat upon the Andalusian at the Battle of Aqua Portora outside of C√≥rdoba in August 742, but Balj ibn Bishr was mortally wounded in the field. Command of the Syrian armies devolved to Thalaba ibn Salama al-Amili, and for the next few months, the Syrians remained bunkered down, while the Andalusians (soon joined by what remained of the Beber rebels), assembled in M√©rida. Much of the next few months was spent in an internecine Arab civil war, the Berber question relegated to a secondary concern. Eventually, tiring of war, the parties, appealed to the Ifriqiyan emir Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi to resolve the matter. Handhala dispatched his cousin Abu al-Khattar ibn Darar al-Kalbi as the new governor for al- Andalus. Abu al-Khattar arrived in May 743 and immediately set about restoring peace in Al-Andalus, liberating prisoners (Arab and Berber) and figuring a resolution to the displaced Syrian troops. He decided to distribute the various Syrian junds across Al-Andalus, carving out regimental fiefs in hitherto thinly-held areas: the Damascus jund was established in Elvira (Granada), the Jordan jund in Rayyu (M√°laga and Archidona), the Palestine jund in Medina-Sidonia and Jerez, the Emesa (Hims) jund in Seville and Niebla and the Qinnasrin jund in Ja√©n. The Egypt jund was divided between Beja (Algarve) in the west and Tudmir (Murcia) in the east.Levi-Proven√ßal, (1950: p.48); Kennedy (1996: p.45). (Al-Maqqari refers to an additional jund from Wasit (Iraq) that was settled in Cabra, but this jund is not recorded in other sources).Al-Maqqari (1840-43: p.46) The Syrian junds were allocated a third of the tax revenues collected in their regions, and given responsibilities of tax-collection and military service to the Andalusian governor. The arrival of the Syrian junds would have tremendous implications for subsequent Andalusian history. They increased substantially the Arab element on the Iberian peninsula, and, as such, were instrumental in deepening the Muslim hold on the south, what would become the heart of al-Andalus. But they also brought trouble. Unwilling to be governed, the Syrian junds carried on an existence of autonomous feudal anarchy, severely destabilizing the power of the governor of al-Andalus. Later years The Maghreb after the Berber Revolt It is common to denote 742 or 743 as the 'end' of the Great Berber Revolt, after the failure of the Berber armies to seize Kairouan or C√≥rdoba. But the Berber hold on Morocco as well as the western and central parts of the Maghrib al-Awsat (Central Maghreb, modern-day Algeria) would continue, leading to the establishment of the Barghwata state in Tamesna by 744, Abu Qurra's state in Tlemcen by 742 and the Midrarid emirate in Sijilmassa by 758, while Arab hold would last over Al-Andalus and Ifriqiya, including the eastern part of modern- day Algeria. Later, non-Berber dynasties came to power with Berber support, such as the Rustamids, a dynasty of Persian descent who by 761 established an Imamate over the area of Tahert,Yassir Benhima, The Rustamids (761-909) , on qantara-med.org (retrieved on 18 April 2013)Rustamid Kingdom, on Britannica (retrieved on 18 April 2013) in modern-day Algeria, and the Sharifian Idrisids in Morocco, by 789 considered as the founder dynasty of the modern Moroccan state.\\"tradition (...) reaches back to the origins of the modern Moroccan state in the ninth century Idrisid dynasty which founded the venerable city of.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 January 1990, when she moved into Ramsay Street with her twin sister, Caroline Alessi, played by Gayle's real-life twin, Gillian Blakeney. Christina marries Paul Robinson and gives birth to their son, Andrew Robinson. Christina departed on 5 August 1992 with Paul and Andrew, following Paul's relocation to Hawaii. Blakeney reprised the role in June 2019 and made her on-screen return on 6 September, alongside her sister. Development In 1989, sisters and television presenters Gayle and Gillian Blakeney were cast as twins Christina and Caroline Alessi respectively, after they wrote to the show's producers at Grundy about making an appearance. They started filming their first scenes seven months after signing with the show. The Blakeneys had an interest in twin psychology at the time, and they worked with the scriptwriters to make sure their characters were portrayed as authenticate as possible. The sisters' fictional backstory was detailed in both Anthony Hayward's The Who's Who of Soap Operas and Josephine Monroe's The Neighbours Programme Guide. It states that identical twins Caroline and Christina were born to an Australian mother and a second- generation Australian father, whose parents had emigrated from Italy. The have an older sister and two younger brothers, but the twins were always closer to each other than anyone else in the Alessi family.Monroe 1994, p.29. When they were younger, the twins often played pranks on their teachers and boyfriends. As they grew older, they kept \\"a mischievous sense of humour\\" and shared similar thoughts. Caroline and Christina developed very different personalities. Where Caroline is more academic, Christina is \\"less driven and more reserved\\". She becomes \\"awkward\\" under pressure and is untidy and less organised than her sister. She is also characterised as being quieter than the confident Caroline. Christina's ambition in life was to be a good wife and mother. Monroe described her as being \\"homeloving and maternal\\".Monroe 1996, p.18. Caroline saw her as the weaker sister. The twins' differing personalities were also shown through their dress sense, with Christina adopting a \\"casual, girlie\\" style in contrast to Caroline's business suits.Monroe 1994, p.30. On 1 June 2019, it was announced that the Blakeney twins had reprised their roles for three episodes to air in September. They filmed their scenes during the same week, before returning to Los Angeles on 7 June. Of their return to the serial, Gayle Blakeney stated, \\"We were tickled pink to be asked back and we knew if they wanted to reprise the characters after so long, it had to be for a great storyline ‚Äì which it is. We're really looking forward to filming it.\\" Christina returned in scenes set in Queensland on 6 September 2019. Storylines Christina and Caroline witness a murder and are placed under a witness protection programme, which sees them move into 22 Ramsay Street. They are advised to act as one person by the police and they chose the alias 'Linda Giles'. Caroline begins working for Paul Robinson at The Robinson Corporation and proved to be good at the job, unlike Christina. During an occasion that Christina is posing as Linda, Paul discovers their secret when Caroline walked in on him and Christina. The police eventually caught the murderer after he appeared in Ramsay Street after tracking the twins down, and they were able to go back to being themselves. They then invite Paul to move in with them and he agrees. Both Christina and Caroline fell for Paul and make a pact that neither one should have him. Christina get managing the gift shop at Lassiter's Hotel, surprising Paul and Caroline by her success. Christina decides to pursue Paul after Caroline dates Adam Willis (Ian Williams) and are delighted when Paul announces that he is in love. However, Paul is talking about Isabella Lopez (Mich White), a woman who he has gotten engaged to while he was away on business in Argentina. Christina is devastated and takes an instant dislike to Isabella. After some digging, Christina exposes Isabella's intentions of getting Paul's money and gaining Australian citizenship. Christina believed that she and Paul were going to be together, but he announces he is finished with women for good. During a holiday with Paul, Adam and Rory Marsden (Tom Jennings), Christina begins flirting with Rory to make Paul jealous, which works and Paul admits to Christina that he loves her. They get engaged and shortly after, they marry and have the reception on a cruise ship. Christina thinks she is pregnant and Paul is thrilled by the news and looks forward to being a father again. However, Christina is old by a doctor that she was not pregnant and, feeling guilty about getting Paul's hopes up, she decides not to tell him and tries to sleep with Paul at every moment to get pregnant. She eventually falls pregnant and when she went into labour, Paul drives her to the hospital, but the car runs out of petrol and stopped. Paul eventually manages to persuade an ice cream van driver to take them to the hospital. Christina then gives birth to a son, Andrew Robinson (Shannon Holmes). Following Paul's nervous breakdown following financial problems, he leaves Christina and Andrew for several weeks. When Paul returns, he brings his 8-year-old daughter Amy Williams (Sheridan Compagnino) with him much to Christina's surprise. Christina and Amy struggle to get along but make up just before Amy is returned to her mother, Nina Williams (Leigh Morgan). When Caroline abruptly leaves Erisnborough, Christina is shocked and later over hears Paul and his grandmother Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) talking about Paul and Caroline's affair. Christina throws Paul out of their house and flies to see her sister, where they eventually make up and Christina returns to Erinsborough, where she files for divorce and full custody of Andrew, but Paul convinces Christina that he loves her and Christina gives him a second chance. They renew their vows in a ceremony at No. 22 and leave Ramsay Street for a new start running a hotel in Hawaii. They later move to Brazil. Their marriage falls apart in the intervening years when Paul returns to Australia to serve a seven year-prison sentence for fraud, and they later divorce. When Andrew (now Jordan Smith) arrives in Erinsborough to see his father, he tells Paul that after living in Scotland for eight years, he and Christina eventually settled down in Sydney. Andrew begins acting up and defying Paul's wife Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall), who calls Christina and asks if Andrew can return to Sydney. However, Christina tells Rebecca that she does not want her son to come home. Years later, Paul finds Christina and Caroline at a resort in Queensland, where he and his fianc√©e Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) have eloped to. Paul is convinced the universe is giving him a sign not to marry Terese, after his other ex-wives turned up in Erinsborough. Paul soon learns from Caroline that the wives are part of a plot orchestrated by his daughter Elle Robinson (Pippa Black). Caroline apologises on her sister's behalf and they both make amends with each other, as well as Paul and Terese. Christina and Caroline act as witnesses for the wedding and they decide to spend some time together before returning to their respective homes. Reception The BBC named Christina's most notable moment as being \\"When she took off with Andrew without Paul knowing.\\" An Inside Soap writer opined that Christina was not as smart as Caroline but the more \\"dim, slightly podgier twin\\". In one story, Caroline and Christina swap identities to secure a business deal. James Cockington from The Sydney Morning Herald branded the story as a \\"contrived\\" effort and raunchy plot ploy designed to beat rival soap opera Home and Away in television ratings.

History The village, already inhabited in pre-Roman times by Ligurians, became an important centre during the Roman Age thanks to its strategic position on Via Aurelia.

Charlemagne gave the land and the port to the Monks Columban. In the Middle Ages Moneglia, along with other villages of eastern Liguria, was invaded by Saracen pirates who sacked it. The fief of Moneglia was ruled, until 1153, by the Fieschi from Lavagna, and subsequently became part of the Republic of Genoa. In 1284 Moneglia participated with its ships at the victorious Battle of Meloria, where Genoa won against the Republic of Pisa.

After releasing a live album of her Idol performances and briefly being a member of the girl group Young Divas in 2007, Mauboy released her debut studio album, Been Waiting, the following year. It earned Mauboy her first number-one single \\"Burn\\", became the second highest- selling Australian album of 2009, and was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Mauboy's second studio album, Get 'Em Girls (2010), showcased a more hard-edged R&B; sound than her previous release, and produced four platinum singles. Her third studio album, Beautiful (2013), which explored a mixture of dance-oriented tracks with R&B; and pop, included the top-ten hits \\"Pop a Bottle (Fill Me Up)\\", \\"Never Be the Same\\" and \\"Can I Get a Moment?\\". Aside from her music career, Mauboy has also ventured into acting, with starring roles in films Bran Nue Dae (2010) and The Sapphires (2012), which earned her the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She returned to acting in 2016, playing the lead role in the television drama series The Secret Daughter for two seasons. It was Mauboy's first major TV role and was written especially for her. Mauboy released two accompanying soundtrack albums for The Secret Daughter, the first of which made her the first Indigenous artist to achieve a number-one album on the ARIA Albums Chart. Her fourth studio album, Hilda (October 2019), debuted at number one. Mauboy is one of Australia's most successful female artists. She has achieved six top-ten albums (including two number-ones) and 16 top-twenty singles (including 9 top-ten hits).

Her father, Ferdy, is an Indonesian-born electrician who came from West Timor, and her mother, Therese, is an Indigenous Australian. Mauboy's mother is from the indigenous Kuku Yalanji people in the rainforest regions of Far North Queensland. Mauboy has three older sisters, Sandra, Jenny and Catherine; and a younger sister, Sophia. From an early age, she was involved in the local church choir with her grandmother Harriett. Her home was described as the \\"noisiest house on the block\\", with her mother often singing, her father playing guitar and the rest of the family displaying their passion for music. Mauboy attended Wulagi Primary School and Sanderson High School in Darwin. She dropped out of school in year 11. At the age of fourteen, Mauboy's talents were exposed through the Telstra Road to Tamworth competition at the 2004 Tamworth Country Music Festival in Tamworth, New South Wales. As the first winner of the competition, Mauboy travelled to Sydney to perform and scored a recording deal with Sony Music Australia. She then released a country-inspired rendition of the Cyndi Lauper hit \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\". A video for her version of the song had a release; however, the song was unsuccessful and Mauboy returned to Darwin. Music career =2006: Australian Idol= Mauboy with Damien Leith at the Australian Idol grand finale In 2006, Mauboy auditioned for the fourth season of Australian Idol in Alice Springs, Northern Territory singing Whitney Houston's \\"I Have Nothing\\".

The media cited her previous Sony contract as grounds for dismissal, but since the contract had expired, Australian Idol producers refused to remove her from the show. Throughout the series, Mauboy continued to impress the judges with her performances. In the final eleven week, following her rendition of Kelly Clarkson's \\"Walk Away\\", judge Kyle Sandilands commented on Mauboy's weight, that if she wished to succeed in the music industry, she should \\"lose the jelly belly\\". Mauboy appeared stunned by the comment. In an interview with Who magazine's Alicia Neil, two years after the comment was made, Mauboy stated \\"I kind of took it as a joke ... I look back on it as a positive thing ‚Äì it made me a stronger person.\\" In the final ten- week, Mauboy received the first touchdown of the season from judge Mark Holden for her rendition of Christina Aguilera's hit, \\"Beautiful\\".

Following that week, she never landed in the bottom three again, and ended up progressing through to the final show with Damien Leith.

In January 2009, she began a long-distance relationship with Themeli \\"Magoo\\" Magripilis, a soccer player and council worker of Greek descent, who was born and raised in Darwin. Alt URL Magripilis played for the Darwin soccer league's club Hellenic Athletic, the same club that Mauboy's younger sister Sophia played for. After seven years of long distance dating, Magripilis relocated from Darwin to Sydney in September 2016 and moved in with Mauboy. When she is not working, Mauboy returns to Darwin to spend time with her family. She is an avid fan of NRL side North Queensland Cowboys. Artistry =Music and songwriting= Mauboy's music is generally R&B; and pop, but she also incorporates dance, funk, soul and hip hop into some of her songs. Mauboy's debut studio album Been Waiting (2008) was described as \\"a blend of electro beats, heartfelt pop tunes and R&B; bass lines.\\" Most of the themes on the album dealt with boys, love and break-ups, everyday life, family issues, and friendship. Alasdair Duncan from Rave magazine described Mauboy's second studio album Get 'Em Girls (2010) as \\"a more hard-edged take on R&B; and pop than her debut, pumped full of hip hop beats, jagged synths and futuristic vocal effects.\\" Mauboy said that she wanted each song on the album to talk about a \\"woman's needs\\", and that the album's theme was \\"very much about the empowerment of women and the domination of women.\\" Kylie Northover of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that Mauboy's third studio album Beautiful (2013) featured \\"a mix of more dance-oriented tunes and her usual R&B; sound\\". Mauboy has also incorporated her Indigenous Australian culture into her music, including songs on the soundtrack album for The Sapphires and in the single \\"Sea of Flags\\". Aside from her vocals work, Mauboy can also play the piano and has co-written some of her material. She co-wrote eleven songs on her first studio album, nine on her second studio album, and fourteen on her third studio album. In 2010, Mauboy was nominated for Breakthrough Songwriter of the Year at the APRA Awards. Mauboy stated in an interview that while working with American producer Harvey Mason, Jr., they came up with the melodies and hooks for the songs \\"Fight for You\\" and \\"Here for Me\\" on the album Get 'Em Girls. She also experimented with an operatic- type voice on her song \\"Scariest Part\\". =Influences= Mauboy grew up listening to country singers Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton and Slim Dusty; she credits country music as her first love of music, saying the genre \\"is who I really, really am deeply.\\" Mauboy also grew up listening to hip-hop rappers Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Mauboy cites Mariah Carey as her main influence and inspiration, stating that she has \\"drawn a lot of inspiration from watching and listening to her live performances\\". She grew up listening to many of Carey's songs and was inspired by her vocal style and songwriting, \\"I loved 'Dreamlover' and 'Fantasy' ‚Äì and picked up loads of tips from her style of singing. She taught me that the lyrics you write have to come from personal experiences ‚Äì I really felt her music. Now I aspire to writing honest lyrics with real feelings that people can relate to.\\" Mauboy also names Whitney Houston as another influence, stating that she looks up to her and Carey \\"for their outstanding vocal performances\\". Her other musical influences are John Farnham and Beyonc√©. Mauboy is also inspired by fellow Indigenous Australian women such as Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman and actress Deborah Mailman. =Public image= Mauboy is known for her good girl image and is considered a role model to young girls and Indigenous communities in Australia. Ed Gibbs of The Sydney Morning Herald described her as a \\"wholesome girl-next-door\\", while Holly Richards of New Idea noted that she \\"is renowned for her squeaky-clean image and family values.\\" Genevieve Rosen of The Vine wrote that Mauboy's \\"flawless public image is no farce. Humble, genuinely engaging and passionate about public service, Mauboy, put simply, is really nice.\\" Anna Byrne of the Herald Sun observed, \\"It's clear this endearing unpretentiousness is not a fame facade. In every respect, the pint-sized pop star embodies one of the most elusive qualities of stardom: relatability. It's this genuineness that has seen her star ascend to where she actually is.\\" Fashion has influenced Mauboy's music career and image. Byrne noted that her \\"fashion choices have mirrored her rise in fame, with her style evolving from shy schoolgirl to confident diva, set to steal the sartorial spotlight.\\" Mauboy cites Jennifer Lopez as her style icon. She has worn dresses designed by Dolce & Gabbana, J'Aton, Steven Khalil and Toni Matiƒçevski, and has appeared on the covers of fashion magazines in Australia, including Elle, InStyle, and Marie Claire. She has also appeared on the cover of Who magazine's Sexiest People issue twice; first in 2012 and again in 2016. Mauboy at Who magazine's Sexiest People party in October 2014 Mauboy's weight has been the subject of media interest, ever since her rise to fame on Australian Idol when judge Kyle Sandilands publicly told her to \\"lose the jelly belly\\". Mauboy told Women's Health magazine that she was proud of her curvy figure, saying \\"having curves is one of my favourite things\\". In 2014, she received media attention for her weight loss transformation from a size 12 to 8. Mauboy has an alter ego named J Malley, who she described as her \\"fearless side\\" and \\"sort of like Beyonc√©'s Sasha Fierce\\". Mauboy is often referred to as Australia's answer to Beyonc√©. However, she does not agree with the comparisons, saying \\"I totally disagree with that one. I've...watched her documentary [Life Is But a Dream] and was just blown away by how magnificent she really is and it's so inspiring for me. I just think she's fantastic and I'm completely nowhere near where she is, but I aspire to that.\\" With the release of Mauboy's second studio album Get 'Em Girls, some critics felt that she was becoming an \\"R&B; sexpot\\". Both the album and its title track also received negative reviews from critics. The music video for the title track was heavily criticised by fans who felt that Mauboy had become too sexy and moved away from her good girl image. Speaking of Mauboy's image for R&B; music, Fairfax Media journalist Bernard Zuel said: \\"It's a problem, matching the personality to a formula. The formula with young women singing modern R&B; is that they have to be out there sexually, thrusting physically and vocally. But that's just not who she is.\\" Following the release of her single \\"Gotcha\\" in 2012, Miranda Cashin of Sunshine Coast Daily noted that it was \\"a return to the Mauboy [we knew] before the infamous 2010 sexed-up fist-pumping album, Get 'Em Girls\\".

Biography Vladimir was the second child of two academic painters. His father, Alexander Bougrine, was an icon restorer and his painter mother Nathalie Anikina also worked at the Hermitage. He was brought up in two rooms at his ancestral home on the Neva River, transformed after the Revolution into community accommodation. When the German army surrounded Leningrad in September 1941 beginning the 900-day Siege, Vladimir and his sister suffered the famine and the cold that would kill mostly the young and the old. Their food ration was 125 grams of bread a day, and Volodia spent his days like the other children looking for food. They were left alone, their parents working or fighting; they ate what they could find, one day he consumed a jar of mustard and the hospital doctors saved his life. He was fortunate, a quarter of the population died, most of them children, but they were the older ones, whose food needs to survive were greater. Between 1956 and 1959, Vladimir attended the Mukhina Institute for art and industrial design and from 1960-65 the academy of Beaux-Arts in Leningrad. He then taught art and theatre sets, painted portraits, and restored icons. From the beginning of the 1970s he painted religious topics, against state orders. Like other painters in the Soviet Union, he was courted by Western diplomats and journalists who had their own agenda. From them, he obtained a gilded picture of life in the West. When painters in the Soviet Union tried to break the yoke of the state which commissioned portraits of political leaders and forbade creativity, dissident artists gathered in a movement for free creation and exhibition of their work. Non-conformist artists in Moscow attempted to reach the public by organising in the open-air what was to become known as the Bulldozer Exhibition on 15 September 1974. Police dispersed the artists and their exhibits. detail of Valdimir's styleIn Leningrad, Vladimir and his mother were among the leaders of the same movement. When the authorities learnt of the exhibition that was being organised, they placed him under house arrest, with police at the door. Vladimir left through a window and with a group of friends marched towards the square where the exhibition would take place. But the square was full of police, and no-one could approach. Although these attempts were thwarted, the artists continued their fight for free expression. The more they fought, the greater the repression from the Soviet authorities. Vladimir was imprisoned in Leningrad, and then, like many other dissident painters, was expelled from his native land. As emigration from the Soviet Union was forbidden for all but Jewish people, the dissident painters, seen as dangerous because rebellious, were expelled as Jewish emigrants. The plane stopped in Vienna. Those who did not continue to Israel were housed in a transitville in the city; here they awaited visas for emigration to either America or France. Vladimir Bougrine had much success in Vienna thanks to his patron Princess Ghislaine Windisch- Graetz and his award-winning portrait of Cardinal Koenig of Vienna. But his intention was to come to France, where he had friends, the Droin family, who had given him support after his imprisonment in Leningrad. In 1977, a few months after arriving in Paris, the French Ministry of Culture introduced him to the Moulin d'Ande, a community of writers, musicians and film-makers, run by Suzanne Lipinska and Maurice Pons. The Moulin was to play a central role in his life thereafter. He was awarded a studio at the Cit√© des Arts in Paris, and continued the rest of his life to paint in Paris, Saint Germain en Laye, Aigremont and Normandy. He continued painting in St. Petersburg in the last two years of his life. From 1969, Vladimir Bougrine participated in over 40 exhibitions, 12 personal ones, in Leningrad, Vienna, Salzburg, Paris, Tokyo, Milan, Bologna, Bari, Bochum, Hamburg, Aubonne, Switzerland, and in the following museums: Russian Museum, Leningrad; Cathedral and diocesan museum, Vienna; Mus√©e du Luxembourg, Paris; Museum of Tokyo, Japan; Museum of the city Bochum, BRD. When Vladimir was granted French nationality in 1984, he was able to return to his homeland to visit his family in St. Petersburg. Although he and his fellow-artists were instrumental in Glasnost which resulted from the spirit of rebellion that was fermenting throughout the land, he was much distressed by the wild capitalism that resulted in gangs of famished children who followed him around the city on his return. He then began to regret the change in society and politics and the deleterious effect on children and old people. Vladimir died in St. Petersburg on 10 August 2001. He is survived by five children of different nationalities.

The burgh, known as Pescino, was devastated by Rothari in 641 and by the Saracens in the 10th century. Later it was a fief of the Fieschi family until 1229, when it was acquired by the Republic of Genoa. In 1432 it was attacked by the fleet of Venice and in 1549, together with Rapallo, by that of Turgut. In 1813, under the Napoleonic domination, the two burghs of Pescino and Corte were unified as Porto Napoleone. Two years later it was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia as the commune of Santa Margherita Ligure. In 1861 it became part of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy.

Santo Stefano d'Aveto borders the comuni of Bedonia, Borzonasca, Ferriere, Rezzoaglio and Tornolo.  Geography  Santo Stefano d'Aveto is about northeast of Genoa, in the Val d'Aveto, near the Aveto river. The town is part of the Comunit√† montana Valli Aveto, Graveglia e Sturla, and is one of five Ligurian towns in the Aveto Natural Regional Park.  History  The town was likely founded during prehistoric times, and the first mention of this town was during the 2nd century BC, where at the foot of Monte Penna a battle between the Romans and Ligurians took place. In the 12th century AD, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa conferred the fief of Santo Stefano d'Aveto upon the Malaspina family, who then constructed the ponderous castle. The fief were then passed on to the Fieschi family and later to the Doria family, all related by an elaborate intermarriage network of noble families.  Main sights *Malaspina Castle (13th century), currently in ruin, but undergoing limited restoration. The castle is located off the central piazza of the town, and features a highly irregular polygonal base. *The sanctuary of the Our Lady of Guadalupe is the town church, on the grounds of which is found the town cemetery.

The town is best known as a launch site for trekking or hiking, horse riding, and skiing. The local mountains are a favorite destination for recreational skiing.  Food = San St√® cheese = \\"San St√®\\" is a traditional cheese made in this town. This cheese is a far cry from the mass-produced confections found in the grocery store. It is produced by a small collection of families, and made in the identical fashion for centuries.http://www.montagna.org/node/4538 The cheese itself is produced from unpasteurized bovine whole milk principally from the Bruno-alpina or Cabannina cattle races, coagulated with veal rennet, either in paste or powder form, at about , mixing for 35 minutes, breaking apart large curds until the mixture is curdled to the size of rice. Salt is also added to the curd. The mixture is then placed in a round form measuring high and in diameter. The cheese in this form weighs about . The crust is thin, elastic, compact, and edible. Inside, the cheese has a yellowish color like wheat. After aging for about two months, the cheese is ready for the table, and provides a delicate flavor, slightly bitter, becoming more intense with greater aging. = Mushrooms = Mushrooms, gathered in the wild, are a very popular delicacy of the town. There exists a long-standing tradition among the men in the town to hunt and gather mushrooms, but to never reveal the source. This tradition, however, has received the attention of the government, and the gathering of mushrooms is now strictly regulated.http://www.valdaveto.net/documento_284.html  Transport  Santo Stefano d'Aveto is served by Strada Provinciale 654 della Val di Nure (SP-654), which connects it to Rezzoaglio. The town is not directly reachable by autostrada, or major highway. Another prominent use of the local, winding roads is the Val d'Aveto Rally, featuring automobile races annually since 1975. The nearest train station to the North is located in Piacenza; the nearest train station to the south is located in Chiavari. Public buses provide transport from the latter to Santo Stefano d'Aveto.

Ameglia borders the municipalities of Lerici and Sarzana. History Ameglia and its territory have an ancient history, that dates back to the 4th century BC, and that displays a maintained importance over the centuries. A necropolis was found in this place and the objects and furnishings discovered reveal that the place was an important transportation center both towards the sea and the nearby mountain passes. It was an important center and port in the Roman era. Traces of this period can be seen in the remains of a Roman maritime villa near the current seaside hamlet of Bocca di Magra. It was, however, in the early Middle Ages that Ameglia reached its apex of political and economic importance. In 963, it was mentioned for the first time in an imperial document of Otto I, where the castrum de Ameliae is mentioned as a possession of the Diocese of Luni. Ameglia was chosen by the diocese as an episcopal residence, its walls fortified and reinforced, during the 11th century. In 1141, part of the fief was purchased by Genoa, which held it until 1252 when it entered into the possession of Nicol√≤ Fieschi, count of Lavagna. Occupied for a brief period by Oberto Doria and Oberto Spinola, possession of Ameglia returned, by 1284, to the bishops of Luni. Throughout the 13th century, construction of the defensive walls, the port, and the tower of the local castle continued. In 1314, according to Boccaccio in his Epistola di frate Ilaro, Dante Alighieri was probably present near the monastery of Santa Croce del Corvo in Bocca di Magra. In 1321, Ameglia was conquered by the Lucchesi condottiero Castruccio Castracani, bringing the territory under the rule of Lucca. After his death in 1328, the medieval citadel passed under the influence of different lords and local families, including the Doria, Visconti, and Fregoso. Genoa would reacquire the feudal rights by 1380. Over the next century, control over Ameglia changed hands several times until reaching a certain stability with a definitive acquisition by the Republic of Genoa, in the second half of the 16th century. Ameglia was placed under the captaincy of Lerici. With the fall of the Genoese Republic to the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte, Ameglia became, on December 2, 1797, part of the short-lived Ligurian Republic. It was located in the Department of the Gulf of Venus, whose capital was La Spezia. Reorganizations placed Ameglia in the Jurisdiction of Lunigiana in 1798 and the Jurisdiction of the Gulf of Venus in 1803. After the Ligurian Republic was directly annexed by France, the town was part of the department of the Apennins from June 1805 to Napoleon's fall in 1814. As a result of the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, Liguria became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, where it remained until Italian unification in 1861. From 1859 to 1927, the territory was included in the district of Levante within the Province of Genoa and, from 1923, the Province of La Spezia. In 1939 the frazione of Tellaro was detached and consolidated into the territory of Lerici.Royal decree of Victor Emmanuel III The latest adjustments to the town's territory were in 1960 when part of Lerici was joined to Ameglia.Presidential decree of Giovanni Gronchi In March 1944, 15 U.S. soldiers of Italian descent were captured by German forces nearby after the failure of the infrastructure-sabatoge mission Operation Ginny II. On March 26, they were summarily executed in Ameglia in violation of the Geneva Convention's rules regarding treatment of prisoners of war. After the war, the Wehrmacht general who ordered the executions, Anton Dostler, was tried and executed for war crimes, the first German general so tried. The rejection of his defense that he was just following orders set a precedent for the Nuremberg trials.

In 1990, a memorial plaque was placed at the site of the deaths of the U.S. soldiers.

It serves as a coastal artery and connects the Strada statale 1 Via Aurelia in the neighborhood of Romito Magra, a frazione of Arcola, to Marina di Carrara. It serves as an important street for the purposes of commercial traffic. There is also another route, provincial road SP 28, that connects Ameglia to Lerici. It goes through Montemarcello and, passing north of Tellaro, arrives in La Serra in Lerici. The scenic view from the road allows one to admire the Gulf of La Spezia and, on particularly clear days, the view of the Tyrrhenian Sea permits the sight of Cap Corse, the northern peninsula of Corsica.

It was accidentally discovered in 1832 by German chemist Carl Ludwig Reichenbach, who is also recognized as being the discoverer of kerosene, phenol, eupion, paraffin wax and creosote. According to history, Reichenbach applied creosote to the wooden posts of his home, in order to drive away dogs who urinated on them. The strategy was ineffective, however, and he noted that the dog's urine reacted with creosote to form an intense dark blue deposit. He named the new substance p√≠ttacal (from Greek words tar and beautiful). He later succeeded in producing pure pittacal by treating beechwood tar with barium oxide and using alumina as a mordant to the dye's fabrics. Although sold commercially as a dyestuff, it did not fare well. Eupittone (derived from eu- + pittacal + -one) is a yellow crystalline substance resembling aurin, and obtained by the oxidation of pittacal. It is also called also eupittonic acid or eupitton.

The skyline of downtown Boston can be seen to the top left, over the tip of Long Island. Gallops Island, also known as Gallups Island, is an island in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. It is situated between Georges Island and Long Island, and is just over from downtown Boston. The island has a permanent size of , plus an intertidal zone of a further , and is composed of one large drumlin, reaching an elevation of above sea level. The island has a rocky beach and offers long vistas from the top of its grassy bluffs. Gallops Island is closed until asbestos remediation is completed. The island is named after John Gallop, one of Boston Harbor's first pilots, who lived on the island. Since then the island has been occupied by a restaurant and inn and a quarantine station. During the Civil War the island was occupied by a military camp housing 3,000 Union soldiers,Large number of Civil War soldier's on Gallop Island and during World War II it was occupied by a radio school and a school for bakers and cooks. During World War I, Gallops Island was used as an infirmary for thousands of American soldiers who contracted \\"Spanish influenza\\" and pneumonia. Many died every day, to be replaced by new arrivals. The island contains a collection of ornamental trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants that date back to its earlier uses, with additional trees being planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Photographs from the 1940s show that a tree lined street extended the length of the island. Although the buildings have been demolished, the pathways and foundations still exist and are lined with privet hedges and surrounded by fruit, shade and coniferous trees, including lilacs, mock-orange, snowberry, and forsythia. Also present are self-sown sumac, poplar, poison ivy, and bayberry. The vegetation has been badly damaged in recent years by the island's population of rabbits. Gallops Island was closed in 2000 due to the presence of asbestos-containing building debris from former military uses. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation has determined that the island will be closed to the public until visitors can be welcomed back safely. As of August 2010, it was predicting a re-opening no earlier than 2015, presuming remediation funding could be obtained.

Majipa Lakhey (, ) is a special lakhey in Nepalese folklore. He is also known as the Peaceful Bhairava(‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§ ‡§≠‡•à‡§∞‡§µ). The dance of this Lakhey takes place only in the week of the full moon of the month of Yenlaa of the Nepal Sambat calendar. He is considered to be the protector of the children.  Etymology  The Newari word Majipa is derived from Sanskrit \\"Manjupattan\\" \\"Manjusri city\\". LƒÅkhe is the term used to denote carnivorous demons. Majipa Lakhey literally means the \\"carnivorous demon of Majipa\\".  Mythology  According to stories passed down through generations, majipa lakhey is supposed to have fallen in love with a girl from Majipa. So, the demon takes a form of a human and enters the city to see his beloved. Upon knowing the fact that the person is a Lakhey, the people capture the lakhey and present him to the king. The king makes a proposal to the demon that he will grant him a place in the city if he vows to preserve the children from other demons and participate in the annual Yanyaa Punhi Jatra (also called Indra Jatra). The Lakhey agrees and is supposed to reside in Majipa ever since. Another story links Lakhey to banishing the two cannibal children of the king Sawan Bhaku, after he was requested to do so by Akash Bhairav and Hanuman. However, the two children return to the city on Yanyaa Punhi to claim their rule and to devour humans. Lakhey is supposed to send them out of the city. This is symbolically represented in a dance conducted in Yanyaa Punhi every year. Majipa Lakhey's wife's name is Lashi, and their daughter's name was Lakhapati.  Majipa Lakhey dance  During the Indra Jatra festival in Nepal, the Majipa Lakhey dance is conducted by the Ranjitkars of Kathmandu. Unlike in other traditional dances, the dancers are not trained in this dance. The Ranjitkars may have inherited this dance in their genes. The costume of Lakhey consists of a mask with hair and costumes attached to it. Together, these costumes and the mask can weigh up to . Before donning the mask, of clothing has to be worn. With all these additional weights, the Lakhey dance must still be performed easily and gracefully.

Bidong Island is accessible from the coastal town of Merang in Setiu district. From 1978 until 2005 Bidong Island was a refugee camp with a population of as many as 40,000 Vietnamese refugees. Vietnamese refugees On 30 April 1975, the Vietnam War ended with the evacuation of the American Embassy and the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese Army. Millions of people tried to flee the new Communist rule in Vietnam. In May 1975, the first boat with 47 refugees arrived in Malaysia from Vietnam. They were called ‚Äúboat people.‚Äù However, the number of boat people fleeing Vietnam was relatively small until 1978. Bidong Island was officially opened as a refugee camp on 8 August 1978 with 121 Vietnamese refugees. The capacity of the camp was said to be 4,500. Another 600 refugees arrived in August and thereafter the arrival of boats from Vietnam was a near daily occurrence. By January 1979, there were 40,000 Vietnamese on the island and by June 1979 it was said to be the most heavily populated place on earth with about 40,000 refugees crowded into a flat area hardly larger than a football field.Thompson, Larry Clinton. Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010, 156-160 The passage from Vietnam was hazardous and the refugee boats were small, overloaded, and often attacked by pirates. Thousands of refugees died at sea; rape and abduction of refugee women was common. In addition, the governments of Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries discouraged refugees from landing on their shores. Refugee boats were often pushed offshore or towed to Bidong and other designated camps. Conditions on Bidong were difficult. One visitor, Leo Cherne, called Bidong \\"Hell Isle.\\" Refugees crowded onto the island \\"lived in makeshift huts two and three stories high made of salvaged timbers from wrecked boats, plastic sheets, tin cans, and corrugated iron sheets.\\" Latrines and wells were inadequate; tropical rainstorms sent rivers of filthy water through the camp; all food and clean water had to be imported from the mainland. Water was rationed at one gallon per day per person. Doctors were abundant, but medicine was in short supply. Sanitation was nearly non-existent and hepatitis was rampant.\\"Thompson, 156-160 But the refugee population was well organised and many small businesses and an efficient food and water distribution system was set up. Aid organisations such as the Malaysian Red Crescent Society, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and many non-governmental organisations assisted the refugees. An international volunteer staff of medical personnel tended to the refugee's health problems. Immigration officials from many countries visited the island to interview refugees for resettlement abroad. The arrival of new refugees to Bidong and other locations in Southeast Asia decreased after June 1979. A Geneva Convention held in July 1979 resulted in Vietnam agreeing to restrain the flow of refugees and the Southeast Asian countries agreeing to take all those who came to their shores provided that the Western countries guaranteed resettlement for the majority of them. President Jimmy Carter raised the quota for permitting Indochinese into the United States from 7,000 to 14,000 per month and other countries followed suit, especially Canada, Australia, and France. The population of Bidong began to decline as refugees departed for resettlement abroad.Thompson, 163-165 By the time Bidong was closed as a refugee camp on 30 October 1991, about 250,000 Vietnamese had passed through or resided in the camp. With the closing of the camp, the remaining refugees in Malaysia were repatriated back to Vietnam. The refugees strongly protested their forced repatriation. A total of 9,000 Vietnamese were repatriated between 1991 and 28 August 2005 when the last refugees departed for Vietnam. In 1999, the island was opened to tourism. It has regained its former pristine beauty and many former refugees have revisited their old home.http://www.terengganutourism.com/pulau_bidong.htm, accessed, 7 July 2010 After the departure of the refugees, the Marine Research Station of Universiti Malaysia Terengganu's was established on the island. The station has living quarters and laboratories for students and researchers to study marine ecosystems.

The Baronetcy, of Edgbaston in the County of Warwick, had been created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 6 April 1728 for Lord Calthorpe's father Henry Gough, who represented Totnes and Bramber in the House of Commons. He was the husband of Barbara, daughter of Reynolds Calthorpe. Three of Lord Calthorpe's sons, the second, third and fourth Barons, both succeeded in the titles. The latter sat as a Member of Parliament for Hindon and Bramber. In 1845 he assumed by Royal licence for himself the surname of Gough only. His eldest son, the fifth Baron, represented East Worcestershire in Parliament as a Liberal. The fifth Baron's younger brother, the seventh Baron (who succeeded his elder brother, the sixth Baron), was a Lieutenant-General in the Army.

She had iron armor plate and an over -thick wooden hull. The danger that Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith, whose troops had reached Covington, Kentucky, just across the Ohio River, would capture Cincinnati, prompted Major General Lew Wallace to take Indianola from the contractor before completion 2 September 1862 and have her launched two days later. Acting Master Edward Shaw was placed in command of the ship on 18 September, and she was reported in commission nine days later.

When ready for general service several weeks later, the water level in the Ohio River had fallen too much for her to get over the falls at Louisville. She finally arrived at Cairo, Illinois and joined the Mississippi Squadron on 23 January 1863. She served briefly in the Mississippi and the Yazoo Rivers before running past the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi to join in an effort to stop the Confederate flow of supplies from the Red River. She left her anchorage in the Yazoo River at 10:15 p.m., 13 February, and moved slowly downstream until the first gun was fired at her from the Vicksburg cliffs slightly more than an hour later. She then raced ahead at full speed until out of range of the Confederate cannon, which thundered at her from above.

Two days later, 16 February, Indianola met prize steamer manned by the survivors of Queen of the West, which had run aground while under heavy fire from Confederate shore batteries at Gorton's Landing (frequently misspelled \\"Gordon's\\" in contemporary accounts, and which had in fact been Barbin's Landing since 1858) in the Red River. Late that afternoon lookouts in Indianola spotted Confederate steamer abreast Ellis Cliffs. She promptly cleared for action and steamed ahead full speed firing at the Southern ship, which proved to be barely out of range. Webb turned about and dashed downstream and out of sight around a bend in the river. A heavy fog set in, compelling Indianola to give up the chase and anchor for the night. Early the next afternoon the fog cleared enabling Indianola to proceed to the mouth of the Red River, where she maintained a strict blockade until 21 February, when she began steaming upstream. Her progress was slowed by two coal barges which she towed so that she might furnish fuel to any ships sent to reinforce her from above Vicksburg. On the evening of 24 February, the Confederate ram Webb and Queen of the West, now Confederate-manned, overtook Indianola and attacked from each side, ramming her seven times before the ironclad, \\"in an almost powerless condition,\\" ran her bow on the west bank of the river and surrendered. Prisoner exchange Seaman John M. Bradley on board USS Indianola Wooden dummy \\"ironclad\\", 1863 USS Indianola explodes in a sketch by Theodore R. Davis, published in Harper's Weekly in 1863. The loss of Indianola was deeply distressing to the Union. It ended Admiral David Dixon Porter's efforts to blockade the Red River by detached vessels while keeping the body of his fleet above Vicksburg, Mississippi, and it prompted Farragut's costly run by the South's forts at Port Hudson on 14 March 1863. On the brighter side, it set the stage for one of the most successful hoaxes of the war. A dummy ironclad was made on an old coal barge by building paddle boxes and a simulated casemate complete with logs painted black to resemble cannons. Pork-barrel funnels containing burning smudge pots were the final touch added just before the strange craft was cast adrift to float past Vicksburg on the night of Indianolas surrender. Word of this \\"ironclad\\" panicked the salvage crew working on Indianola, causing them to set off the ship's magazines to prevent her recapture. After Vicksburg fell, and following long and difficult struggle, Indianola was refloated on 5 January 1865 and towed to Mound City, Illinois, 17 January, where she was sold.

Omaopio was originally settled by several Japanese families. It has been and still is a farming community with very rich soil. Traditional crops include the Kula onion (Granex), broccoli, beans, and cabbage. Recently, coffee (arabica) has been introduced. Traditional animals include goats, hogs and cattle. More recently the area has seen a large influx of horses, and commercial stables. Sugar cane fields bracketed the lower end of the road, but crop plantings were discontinued in 2016.

The town is on the coast at the mouth of a river valley, between hills thickly wooded with olive and pine trees. The ridges on either side of the valley thrust out into the sea as the headlands of Mesco and Levanto. The municipality forms part of the coastal district known as the Comunit√† Montana della Riviera Spezzina, and part of its territory is included in the Cinque Terre National Park.  History  In Roman times there was already a small settlement there by the name of Ceula, an important nodal point due to its location and harbour. At the beginning of the 9th century, the bell tower of the present church, the Chiesa di San Siro, served as a watchtower and as a defence against dangers from the sea. From the 13th century, however, the importance of the area began to decline ‚Äì this was to the advantage of Levanto itself, which was expanding by the sea. Levanto first became the feudal stronghold of the Malaspina, before passing to the Da Passano and then, in 1229, to the Republic of Genoa. In the Middle Ages, the village became a centre of commercial activity, benefiting from maritime and overland travel, the most important of the latter routes being the via Francigena, the ancient pilgrims' way that in medieval times connected Canterbury to Rome. In the post-Medieval period, the village saw major development with the construction of the Borgo Nuovo or Stagno, largely completed by the 17th century, on the plain of the small river Ghiararo. This area is characterised by interesting painted 17th and 18th century houses, some built on much earlier buildings. A further phase of urban development took place at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries with the opening of two new thoroughfares, the present Corso Italia and Corso Roma. From 1950, the village experienced further growth, culminating during the 1970s in the present townscape.  Main sights  *Medieval castle, built to defend the village and still in a state of perfect conservation. Privately owned and not open to the public. *Church of Sant'Andrea (Church of Saint Andrew).

It was hosted by Monty Hall, joined by Sylvie Garant as assistant very early on in the run, with Sandy Hoyt as the show's announcer. Taped at Showline Milton Stage in Toronto, Ontario in association with the Global Television Network, the show was created and produced by two American game show veterans, Willie Stein and Nat Ligerman. Each episode featured a rotating panel of four comedians, which included such famous personalities of the day as Alan Thicke, Nipsey Russell, Arte Johnson and Jo Anne Worley. Rules The show pitted two contestants against each other. Each took turns listening to a joke told by one member of the panel, while the other panel members each delivered a different punchline to the joke. The contestant had to determine which of the punchlines was the original punchline to the joke; if correct, that player scored; otherwise, the points went to his/her opponent. Values were 5 points in round 1, 10 points in round 2, and 50 points in the 3rd and final round (which was played slightly differently from the first two: Monty himself read the joke, 3 of the panelists supplied punchlines, and both contestants guessed on the same joke. The 4th panelist revealed the correct punchline). The player with the most points at the end of this round won the game and $250; in the event of a tie, a tie-breaker was played in the same way as a high-low question on Card Sharks. Later episodes featured an all-cash format where correct answers were worth $25 in round 1 and $50 in round 2. The final joke was worth $100. Add-a-Word Round The winner played the \\"Add-a-Word\\" bonus round, based on an old party game. A phrase such as \\"I always forget my...\\" would appear on a board, under which eight letters would be uncovered one at a time. The celebrities had to go around twice adding a word to the chain that began with the next letter. For the above example, if \\"A\\" were uncovered, the first celebrity might say \\"I always forget my apples.\\" Then if a \\"B\\" were uncovered, the second would have to say \\"I always forget my apples and my balloons.\\" This would continue for all eight letters. If the celebrity could not remember a previous word, the contestant could tell them. After all eight words were given, the contestant then had to repeat the entire phrase. The celebrities could not tell the contestant the next word, but could mime or gesture to assist. The contestant had 60 seconds to build the chain and repeat it in order to win $500. The enforcement of the rules was not always strict, and celebrities occasionally gave the wrong word while building the chain or gave verbal clues while the contestants were trying to repeat the chain. Music Milton DeLugg provided the theme song, which had previously been used as a cue on various Chuck Barris game shows. Reruns The series was repeated on Global later in the 1980s, followed by a run on DejaView from 2002 to 2004, and later aired on GameTV from 2007 to 2010.

In 1992, she was elected Macomb County Clerk, and was re-elected in 1996, 2000, and 2004, 2008 and 2012. 2006 Secretary of State Election Sabaugh secured the Democratic nomination for Michigan Secretary of State on August 27, 2006, defeating state Rep. Mary Waters at the Michigan Democratic Party convention. Sabaugh was easily defeated by Republican incumbent Terri Lynn Land, losing by a margin of 56 percent to 42 percent. 2016 Macomb County Clerk Election In March 2016, Sabaugh filed to seek a seventh term as County Clerk. Speculation began to arise that Sabaugh may drop out of the race after Macomb County Commissioner and former state Rep. Fred Miller announced on April 15 that he would challenge Sabaugh for the Democratic nomination for County Clerk. On April 19, the filing deadline to qualify for Michigan's August primary ballot, Sabaugh called speculation that she would drop out of the race \\"wishful thinking,\\" while Miller officially filed for the Clerk's race just minutes before the 4 p.m. deadline. On April 22, just 15 minutes before Michigan's 4 p.m. deadline to withdraw from the ballot, Sabaugh announced she would not seek re-election and immediately endorsed Miller, citing a desire to spend more time with her family. On May 2, 2016, Mt. Clemens political activist Greg Murray filed ethics complaints with the Macomb County Ethics Board against Miller and Sabaugh, saying the pair colluded with former Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Mark Brewer, who filed to run for Miller's seat on the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, saying that Miller personally filed Brewer's paperwork just minutes before the April 19th 4 p.m. filing deadline, an accusation that Miller refused to deny directly. County Executive Mark Hackel said the accusations were \\"extremely questionable‚Äù and that the situation \\"...doesn‚Äôt come across well for voters.\\" The \\"plan\\" backfired for Sabaugh, Miller and Brewer on all fronts. First, Brewer was defeated in the August 2016 primary for the Democratic nomination for Miller's old seat om the Macomb County Board of Commissioners by Elizabeth Lucido. Miller was upset by political novice Karen Spranger, by a margin of 635 votes out of the approximately 376,000 cast. Miller's stunning loss was attributed to the political coattails of Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. Trump garnered 54 percent of the vote in Macomb County, which also saw Republicans Candice Miller (no relation to Fred) and Larry Rocca win countywide races as Public Works Commissioner and County Treasurer respectively and Trump became the first Republican to carry Michigan in a presidential election since 1988.

It was released by Rainbow Arts in 1989 for the Commodore 64, and in 1990 for the Amiga, Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. Gameplay Before starting the game and between levels, the player visits a shop and uses their game score to purchase new submarines and equipment. The submarines come in four different variants, and additional purchases act as additional \\"lives\\". Each can be equipped with a one-way, two-way or three-way fire weapon of increasing power (and thus cost). Secondary weapons include sonic waves, power-shots and target-seeking missiles. The player can also purchase auxiliary satellites and specify their movement pattern, which can be circular orbits, vertical and horizontal movements, or an intercepting action. Reception The ZX Spectrum version achieved critical success. Your Sinclair gave it a score of 84%, highlighting the comprehensive shop sequence and large, well-animated enemies. Criticisms included the monochrome graphics which were said to be a little confusing, and the lack of a sense of danger. Naming During the time of release, there was some debate as to whether the game was actually pronounced \\"cross out\\" or \\"X out\\" (\\"ex out\\"). However, the cassette version of the Commodore 64 release displays \\"Loading Crossout\\" at the beginning of the loading process. Also, in both Amiga and C64 versions, the synthesized voice in the introduction says, \\"Get ready for Crossout.\\" The sequel Z-Out abandons this pronunciation pattern.

It has a population of 15,340. It has a very arid climate. It is located in a zone of Spain that produces large quantities of wine and olive oil. The language spoken is Castellano. La Solana is member of the cultural programme Ruta √ë to promote the Spanish language and culture. Photo: Students of Spanish in the \\"Museo La Rosa del Azafr√°n\\" (La Solana). La Solana was settled, as with many other villages in the La Mancha region, thanks to the re-population carried out in the 13th century by the three Military Orders which received the territory that nowadays corresponds to the province of Ciudad Real: Santiago, Calatrava and San Juan. Therefore, this is not an ancient village \\"won against the Moors\\" and not even one of the first to be founded in the first half of that century, since there is a belief, confirmed in the local writings, which date 1283 as the beginning of the occupation of the village. \\"Las Relaciones Topogr√°ficas de Felipe II,\\" written in 1575, prove the existence of a tower which served as a fort to defend the people against the possible attacks of Muslims. This tower was probably constructed by the Order of Santiago (religious order) whose knight commander from 1440 to 1477 was Diego de Villegas. It is logical to think that the tower which is described in the Books of Visitors of the Order of Santiago is the same tower which is mentioned in \\"Las Relaciones de Felipe II\\", where the current tower of the Santa Catalina Church now stands. The descriptions of cardenal Lorenzana from the year 1788 tell us that the first settlers were Sorian shepherds who came seasonally with their herds, and, attracted by the fertility of the lands of La Moheda and La Veguilla, which neighbor the historic center, moved their homes here and became the founding population. In 1463, according to Doctor √Ångela Madrid Medina, it was granted the title of town. In 1468 there were about 200 residents, and, in 1575, 750 residents. Wine production, primarily red, was \\"famous in the local areas\\" to which it was exported. The neighboring town, Membrilla, was said in 1575 to have 1,000 residents, but based on the record of the tithes, it produced less wine that Solano, highlighting instead the products of the orchards situated in the plain of the river Azuer, which supplied La Solana. It is possible that the good wine from Membrilla that Miguel de Cervantes drank, and which would then appear in his Italian wine cellar, Licenciado Vidriera, was wine from La Solana. La Solana, like everything in Campo de Montiel, belonged to the Orden de Santiago. However, the leadership of the Order changed substantially during the reign of the Reyes Cat√≥licos. The power of the Knight Commander and council diminished, and the kings themselves became \\"perpetual administrators by apostolic license\\" as they created an Order Council dependent on the crown. This ended the excessive economic and military power of the Commanders, which had intervened so much in the Crown's internal disputes; in addition, the administration of the territory became similar to the others of the realengo (certain towns that didn't belong to the Church), instituting governors and mayors, who brought government and the administration of justice to the towns of the Campo. Villanueva de los Infantes, situated 25 kilometers (15.5 mi) from La Solana, was chosen as the seat of government, relegating to second tier the historical and medieval center, Montiel, due to its stagnant growth and distance from the liveliest towns: Membrilla, La Solana, Villahermosa and La Torre de Juan Abad. The name of La Solana, it is said in old writings, comes from a well called La Fuente de la Solana, used in the earlier days by shepherds and settlers. The name of the well was due to being near a spring, located on the sunny side of the small hill where the town was located. This area corresponds to the current Rasillo Santa Ana, where there is a small garden. A street of steps descends from there and meets another eastbound street that is called \\"de la Fuente\\". The street called \\"de la Fuente\\" in the cadastre of Marqu√©s de La Ensenada from 1751 was actually the street of steps. The spring, called \\"the old font\\" in documents preserved in historical archives, continued to exist for centuries until it silted up. There is no record of how it happened or the location of the original well. Nevertheless, it is significant that the house that borders the street of steps on its west side, an old house belonging to the lineage of the gentlemen of the P√©rez Cabellos, preserves an old cave with a spring of water inside of it stuck to the alley and to the street with the steps. Afterwards, important events, such as the arrival of the Barefoot Friars Trinitarios in the 17th century, and the Barefoot Mothers Dominicas which founded their own convents. In modern history, the \\"Century of the Sickles\\", el 20th, stands out, because La Solana became the center of manufacturing for these tools; however, because of current technology, this activity has fallen into decline. In 1965 the Band of cctt de Ntro. Padre Jes√∫s Rescatado was founded. The Band of Horns and Drums of Ntro. Padre Jes√∫s Rescatado of La Solana was founded in 1965 by Antonio Serrano after the decision of the brotherhood to found its own Band of Horns and Trumpets. The band went on parade for the first time with 11 instruments in the beginning of the same year, accompanied by its leader through the streets of La Solana, dressed in the robes of the brotherhood. In total, the band in its first parade was formed by five drums y six horns. In 1966 the band's first uniform premiered, made up of a white jacket and black pants. Over time, new instruments were incorporated and new uniforms continued to be produced, but it was in the early eighties that the band reached one of their best eras, winning numerous prizes in the different contests held in the area.

P. Lovecraft in collaboration with Harry Houdini in February 1924. Commissioned by Weird Tales founder and owner J. C. Henneberger, the narrative tells a fictionalized account in the first-person perspective of an allegedly true experience of escape artist Harry Houdini. Set in 1910, in Egypt, Houdini finds himself kidnapped by a tour guide, who resembles an ancient pharaoh, and thrown down a deep hole near the Great Sphinx of Giza. While attempting to find his way out, he stumbles upon a gigantic ceremonial cavern and encounters the real-life deity that inspired the building of the Sphinx. Lovecraft accepted the job because of the money he was offered in advance by Henneberg. The result was published in the May‚ÄìJune‚ÄìJuly 1924 edition of Weird Tales, although it was credited solely to Houdini until the 1939 reprint. Despite Lovecraft's use of artistic license, Houdini enjoyed the tale and the two men collaborated on several smaller projects prior to the latter's death in 1926. \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" has been suggested as an early influence on author Robert Bloch and as anticipating the cosmic themes in Lovecraft's later work, including \\"The Shunned House\\". Synopsis Told from the first-person perspective of escape artist Harry Houdini, \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" is a fictionalized account of an encounter that he claims to have experienced while on vacation in Egypt in January 1910. Enlisting the services of a guide named Abdul Reis el Drogman, Houdini is taken on a tour of Cairo and eventually forced to break up a conflict between his guide and a Bedouin leader by the name of Ali Ziz. Drogman enlists Houdini to help him settle the fight by way of a \\"custom of great antiquity in Cairo\\":Lovecraft, p. 277 a boxing match atop the Great Pyramid of Giza. Houdini soon discovers, however, that the entire argument was merely a ruse designed to lure him into the desert at night and kidnap him. The escape artist is tied up, taken to an unknown location, and dropped down a deep pit. After dreaming of spectacular horrors, Houdini awakens at the bottom of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman. Background Harry Houdini was pleased with the result of Lovecraft's work and collaborated on several other projects with him prior to Houdini's death in 1926. Facing financial problems, J. C. Henneberger, the founder and owner of Weird Tales, wanted to associate the popular Harry Houdini with the magazine in order to boost its readership. Following the introduction of an \\"Ask Houdini\\" column, as well as the publication of two short stories allegedly written by the escape artist, Henneberger sought out Lovecraft in February 1924 and commissioned him to write the tale of a supposedly true experience that Houdini had had in Egypt. Lovecraft was paid $100 (approximately $ in present-day terms) to ghostwrite the story, at the time the largest sum he had ever been given as an advance. This was a major factor in motivating him to take the job as, after listening to Houdini's story and researching its background, Lovecraft concluded that the tale was completely fabricated and requested permission from Henneberger to take artistic license. After receiving clearance from the editor, he began his writing by spending considerable time researching the setting in books issued by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as by frequently visiting the museum's Egyptian exhibits. Lovecraft completed \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" in February 1924 but lost his original typescript of the story at Union Station in Providence, Rhode Island when he was on his way to New York to get married. He was forced to spend much of his honeymoon in Philadelphia retyping the manuscript. The work's original title, \\"Under the Pyramids\\", is known only from the lost and found advertisement that he placed in The Providence Journal. The tale was printed in the May‚ÄìJune‚ÄìJuly 1924 edition of Weird Tales as \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" and without credit to Lovecraft in the byline, as Henneberger thought that this would confuse the readers, as the narrative was told entirely from Houdini's first-person perspective. Lovecraft would later receive credit in the editor's note of the 1939 reprint. Reception and legacy \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" became a popular story and was received favorably by Houdini. The escape artist was so impressed that, until his death, he continued offering the writer jobs and ghostwriting opportunities. Among them was an article criticizing astrology (for which he was paid $75 - approximately $ in present-day terms) and a book entitled The Cancer of Superstition, of which Lovecraft had completed an outline and some introductory pages prior to Houdini's 1926 death. To thank the author for his work, Houdini gave Lovecraft a signed copy of his 1924 book A Magician Among the Spirits. Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi praised the tale, calling it \\"surprisingly effective and suspenseful, with a genuinely surprising ending\\". Science fiction and fantasy author, editor, and critic Lin Carter, in his 1972 work Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos, refers to the story as \\"one of the best things Lovecraft had written up to that time\\". \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" has been cited as an early influence on Robert Bloch, which is particularly evident in his tale \\"Fane of the Black Pharaoh\\". Although Lovecraft himself refers to the real sphinx as a god of the dead, Bloch expanded upon the mythos and claimed that the sphinx in \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" was actually Nyarlathotep, an Outer God and Lovecraft creation. The idea of a twist ending, where a terrible discovery is made worse by the realization that it is only part of a larger horror, was used again in \\"The Shunned House\\", written later that year. In this tale, the protagonist digs into the cellar of the eponymous dwelling only to find that the thing he believed to be the monster of the tale is only the beast's elbow. The text of \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\", like many of Lovecraft's works, is in the public domain and can be found in several compilations of the author's work as well as on the Internet.

It presents itself as being written by the Twelve Apostles at the time of the Council of Jerusalem; however, scholars agree that it was actually a composition of the 3rd century, perhaps around 230 AD. The Didascalia was clearly modeled on the earlier Didache. The author is unknown, but he was probably a bishop. The provenance is usually regarded as Northern Syria, possibly near Antioch. Manuscript tradition Paul de Lagarde, who first re-discovered the Didascalia The earliest mention of the work is by Epiphanius of Salamis, who believed it to be truly Apostolic. He found it in use among the Audiani, Syrian heretics. The few extracts Epiphanius gives do not quite tally with our present text, but he is notoriously inexact in his quotations. At the end of the fourth century the Didascalia was used as the basis of the first six books of the Apostolic Constitutions. At the end of the 4th century it is quoted in the Pseudo- Chrysostom's Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum. But the Didascalia never had a great vogue, and it was superseded by the Apostolic Constitutions. The Didascalia Apostolorum, whose lost original was in Greek, was first published in 1854 in Syriac by Paul de Lagarde. In 1900 Edmund Hauler published the Verona Palimpsest which includes a Latin translation of the Didascalia, perhaps of the fourth century, more than half of which has perished. In 1906 Franz Xaver von Funk published the texts, printed side by side, of both the Didascalia and the Apostolic Constitutions, in order to show the similarities.Didascalia et Constitutiones Apostolorum, ed. F. X. Funk (2 vols. Paderborn, 1906). A short fragment of chapter 15 has been found in Greek, and in 1996 another probable fragment in Coptic. Contents The Latin title Didascalia Apostolorum means Teaching of the Apostles, and the full title given in Syriac is: \\"Didascalia, that is, the teaching of the twelve Apostles and the holy disciples of our Lord\\". The text never touches upon dogma but concerns itself entirely with practice. In comparison with the Didache, the Didascalia moved the main focus from the moral issues to liturgical practice and church organization. The content can be so summarized: * Admonitions about Christian life, prayer, orphans, martyrdom (chapters 1‚Äì3, 13, 17, 19‚Äì20) * Rules about bishops' qualifications, conduct, duties, alms (chapters 4‚Äì11, 18) * Rules about deacons and deaconesses and widows (chapters 14‚Äì16) * Liturgical rules about the proper place in the church-building and about fasting (chapters 12, 21) * The education of children and the denouncement of heresy (chapters 22‚Äì23) * The claim of the composition of the treatise by the Twelve Apostles and a condemnation of the Jewish ritual practices directed toward Jewish ChristiansStrecker, Georg. \\"On the Problem of Jewish Christianity,\\" in Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity (trans. Robert Kraft from the 1934 German original). Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971. (chapter 24‚Äì26) The church officials are bishops, deacons, priests, widows (and orphans); deaconesses are also added, in one place rectors, and once subdeacons (these last may have been interpolated). The preface to the English translation states, \\"The most salient feature of the Didascalia is its exaltation of the authority of the Bishops ; yet there is no mention of the Bishops of Rome as superior over other Bishops.\\" Celibacy is preferred for bishops but not required for that office, while even the combing of hair (as well as long hair) is forbidden for men in general, lest they attract women. Especially noticeable is the treatment which bishops are ordered to give to penitents. Even great sinners, on repentance, are to be received with kindness, no sins are excepted. The canonical penance is to be of two to seven weeks. However, if a converted man \\"of the Jews or of the heathen\\" returned again to the sect in which he came from, then he was not to be received a second time into the church, but were to be regarded as unconverted. (Didascalia 20:16) The heresies mentioned are those of Simon Magus and Cleobius (this name is given also by Hegesippus), with Gnostics and Ebionites. Against these, Christians must believe in the Trinity, the Scriptures and the Resurrection. The original Law of Moses (specifically the Ten Commandments) is to be observed, along with all the regulations given prior to the incident of the Golden Calf (Exo. 32). But the \\"Second Law,\\" the regulations given after the incident of the Golden Calf, were given to the Jews on account of the hardness of their hearts (Did. 26). In addition, the Sabbath rest is given a symbolic content, and the Christians are admonished to instead treat every day as belonging to the Lord, but not to keep the rest literally. The Old Testament is frequently quoted, and often at great length. The Gospel is cited by name, usually that of Matthew, the other evangelists less often, and that of John least of all. The Acts of the Apostles and nearly all the Epistles are freely employed, including the Epistle to the Hebrews, but the Apocalypse is not cited. None of these could be named. Besides the Didache, the Didascalia utilizes also other ancient Christian documents as the Acts of Paul and the Gospel of Peter. Translation into English Margaret Dunlop Gibson was the first person to translate the work into English in 1903. It was published by C. J. Clay & Sons in Cambridge. R. Hugh Connolly translated the work into English in 1929. It was published by Clarendon Press, Oxford. It included an extensive introduction by Connolly. In the same year of 1929, G. Homer also did a translation, also in Oxford.

It was founded as Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin 1914, moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad in 1962 and more recently in a new building in Frankfurt-Riedberg. It is one of 83 institutes in the Max Planck Society (Max Planck Gesellschaft).  Research  Research at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research focuses on the operation of networks of neurons in the brain. The institute hosts three scientific departments (with directors Moritz Helmstaedter of the Helmstaedter Department, Gilles Laurent of the Laurent Department, and Erin Schuman of the Schuman Department), the Singer Emeritus Group, two Max Planck Research Groups, namely Johannes Letzkus' Neocortical Circuits Group and Tatjana Tchumatchenko's Theory of Neural Dynamics Group, as well as several additional research units. The common research goal of the Institute is a mechanistic understanding of neurons and synapses, of the structural and functional circuits which they form, of the computational rules which describe their operations, and ultimately, of their roles in driving perception and behavior. The experimental focus is on all scales required to achieve this understanding - from networks of molecules in dendritic compartments to networks of interacting brain areas. This includes interdisciplinary analyses at the molecular, cellular, multi-cellular, network and behavioral levels, often combined with theoretical approaches.  History  The \\"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Hirnforschung\\" (KWI for Brain Research) was founded in Berlin in 1914, making it one of the oldest institutes of the \\"Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science\\", itself founded in 1911. It was based on the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center), a private research institute established by Oskar Vogt in 1898 and run together with his wife C√©cile Vogt-Mugnier, also an accomplished brain researcher. From 1901 to 1910, Vogt's coworker at this institute was Korbinian Brodmann, who in 1909 established the cytoarchitectonic classification of cortical areas still in use today (e.g., his area 17 is the primary visual cortex). Oskar Vogt's own scientific achievements also were in the field of cortical cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics. In the 1920s Oskar Vogt became interested in the potential morphological correlates of mental abilities, and hence in the neuroanatomical study of 'elite brains'. When Lenin died of a brain hemorrhage in 1924, his brain was preserved in formaldehyde, where it remained for two years. In 1926, Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin's genius via histological investigation of his brain. He was given some space in Moscow to carry out this work and two years later, a spacious and representative brick building that had been confiscated from an American business. In it, he helped establish and then headed the Moscow Brain Institute. Between 1926 and 1930, Vogt travelled to Moscow several times to supervise the work on Lenin's brain by the Russian collaborators who had been trained at Vogt's KWI for Brain Research in Berlin. In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking (\\"Assoziationsathlet\\") - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries. Lenin's brain was, for a time, on display in the Lenin Mausoleum and now rests at Moscow's Brain Institute. World War I delayed the plans for a new building to house the KWI for Brain Research. The KWI's first proper building in Berlin-Buch was only inaugurated in 1931 under the directorship of Oskar Vogt. It was the world's largest and most modern brain research institute of its time, including Departments of Neurophysiology (T√∂nnies and Kornm√ºller), Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt and Veit), Genetics (Timof√©eff-Ressovsky), a Research Clinic (Soeken, Zwirner), and the Neuroanatomical Departments of Oskar and his wife C√©cile Vogt. Based on critical remarks Vogt had made about national socialism, a protective attitude towards Jewish coworkers at the institute, and rumors that he was a communist (spirited by his Moscow contacts), Vogt was pressed to early retirement by 1937. The Vogts moved to Neustadt in the Black Forest and established another private brain research institute, funded in part by the family of steel baron Krupp (who had already funded Vogt¬¥s first private institute in Berlin) and by Vogt¬¥s own funds. In 1937, Nazi physician Hugo Spatz, a pupil of Franz Nissl, became Vogt's successor as director of the KWI for Brain Research and head of the Neuroanatomy Department. During his tenure, the Departments of Neuropathology (Hallervorden) and of Tumor Research (T√∂nnis) were added. One focus of both Spatz‚Äôs and Julius Hallervorden‚Äôs histological research were pathologies of the extrapyramidal/motor system. In a previous collaboration they had described an extrapyramidal disease that was originally named Hallervorden- Spatz syndrome. Between 1940 and 1945, Hallervorden and Spatz became involved in the atrocities of the Nazi regime by studying the brains of euthanasia victims. For many years, brain sections from these studies remained archived in the institute (which by then had become the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main) together with research material from other periods. When this was recognized, all sections dating from the period 1933-1945 were given a burial at a Munich cemetery by the Max Planck Society in 1990. A memorial stone was erected in honor of the victims of these atrocities. Use of the eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is strongly discouraged due to Hallervorden and Spatz's involvement with the Nazi party and was replaced by the more descriptive terminology pantothenate kinase- associated neurodegeneration. After 1945, the different departments of the KWI for Brain Research were relocated to Dillenburg, Giessen, K√∂ln, Marburg and G√∂ttingen. In 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded to succeed the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and the institute became the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Hallervorden retired as director in 1955, Spatz in 1959. In 1962, a new building was erected in Frankfurt-Niederrad to house the Departments of Neurobiology (Hassler, Director 1959-1982) and Neuropathology (Kr√ºcke, Director 1956-1979), as well as the Research Groups \\"Evolution of the Primate Brain\\" (Stephan) and \\"Neurochemistry\\" (Werner). Rolf Hassler, a pupil of Oskar Vogt and coworker of the famous Freiburg neurologist Richard Jung, studied subcortical brain areas, thalamo-cortical systems, basal ganglia and the limbic system. Wilhelm Kr√ºcke, a pupil of Hallervorden, was a renowned specialist on peripheral neuropathies. He was the reason for the institute's relocation to Frankfurt, as he was simultaneously head of the 'Edinger Institute', the Neuropathology Department of Frankfurt University's Medical School. In 1982, the KWI for Brain Research's Department of General Neurology, which had been relocated to K√∂ln, became the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in that city, independent of the MPI for Brain Research. The other relocated departments of the KWI were closed with the retirement of their directors. In 1981, the MPIH was restructured towards non-clinical, basic neuroscience through the establishment of the Departments of Neuroanatomy (W√§ssle, Director 1981-2008) and Neurophysiology (Singer, Director 1982-2011), followed by the Department of Neurochemistry (Betz, Director 1991-2009). Heinz W√§ssle conducted functional and structural studies of the mammalian retina, Heinrich Betz analyzed the molecular components of synapses, and Wolf Singer studied higher cognitive functions with a focus on the visual system. In the first decade of the new millennium, the MPG defined the analysis of neural networks as a central research topic for the institute. In 2008 Erin Schuman and Gilles Laurent were appointed as directors of the departments \\"Synaptic Plasticity\\" and \\"Neural Systems\\", respectively. The new departments took up work in the summer of 2009 and were initially located in interim facilities on the Science Campus \\"Riedberg\\" of the Frankfurt University. The construction of a new building for the institute on this campus was recently finalized, next to the MPI of Biophysics. The new institute building currently houses the three departments of the institute (those of Erin Schuman, Gilles Laurent and Moritz Helmstaedter), several Research Groups at the institute (Tatjana Tchumatchenko and Johannes Letzkus recently joined as Max Planck Group Leaders in 2013), several core facilities, and the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics of Peter Mombaerts. , Moritz Helmstaedter is the Managing Director of the Institute.  Graduate Program  The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Neural Circuits is a graduate program offering a Ph.D. The school is run in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics and the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main as well as the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies and the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute.

The protest led to a crackdown on rights activists and further repression of the farmers.  Details  Between 1992 and 1997, 23,000 Chinese farmers were resettled in Tangshan City, Hebei to make way for the Taolinkou reservoir, some to east of Beijing. By 2004, more than eight years after they had been moved, the displaced farmers had not been properly compensated. The farmers asserted that up to 60 million yuan of compensation funds had been misappropriated by officials from the local Government. They said they were owed 13,000 yuan (U.S. $1,570) per household in compensation but some had received only half the amount, while others had received nothing. Under the leadership of Zhang Youren, a peasant activist, the farmers organised a petition. They were given advice and encouragement by Yu Meisun and Li Boguang, both legal scholars, and Zhao Yan a journalist with the magazine China Reform. The petition, signed by 11,238 farmers, was entitled \\"The request to remove the National and Heibei Province People's Congress Representative status of Tangshan Municipal Communist Party Secretary, Zhang He\\". The petition described the living conditions of the displaced farmers and how previous appeals had led to beatings, detention and forced labour. In February 2004, a group of ten farmer representatives travelled to the capital to submit their petition to the National People's Congress. In his opening speech to the Congress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao promised a crackdown on corruption and illegal land seizures. Nevertheless, the farmers from Tangshan were rounded up by the Beijing police who accused them of being Falungong members and subversives. Zhang Youren was put under pressure to denounce the 'criminals' who had supported the petition. Zhao Yan quickly lost his job with the China Reform magazine and by the end of the year he had been imprisoned; he was still in jail two years later when the authorities finally convicted him of fraud. Li Boguang was arrested in December 2004 but released after a few weeks on condition that he had no further involvement in farmer protests. Yu Meisun, who had already served an earlier jail sentence, was able to publish an online diary that gave details of police harassment.  Personal Account  Yu Meisun's diary includes the following account by Zhao Yan: > Since early this year, displaced people from Tangshan and Qinhuangdao here > in Hebei, and Fu'an City and Minhou Country in Fujian whose rights have long > been violated have been demanding the recall of their Party Secretaries and > mayors, making 2004 a landmark year for peasant activism. But these > campaigns have been unlawfully suppressed by local police. The corrupt > officials who are targets of the people's boiling grievances haven't been > affected at all... This will ultimately lead the peasants to despair of any > method but rebellion, and we'll see a new peasant revolution. In a couple of > days, I'll go to Tangshan to visit Zhang Youren. Let's see if Zhang He has > the nerve to arrest and charge me!

It is southwest of Llys y Fran and north of Clarbeston Road and in Clarbeston Road community in Pembrokeshire, Wales. History Walton East, in the 12th century, was part of the possessions of the commandery of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem at Slebech, given by its Norman owner, Walter de Wale, thus its name: \\"Wale's town\\", or Walton. It is marked as just Walton on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. Until the 16th century, the parish was in the hundred of Dungleddy in Pembrokeshire, southwest Wales. Owen in 1602 placed it on the English side of the language boundary, but by the 19th and 20th centuries it was a mainly Welsh-speaking community. In the 1870s, the parish extended to with a population of 223 in 40 houses. In 1875, a Welsh Calvinist Methodist Chapel was built in the village. In the southwest of the parish is Penty Park, former home of members of the Philipps family; there are two listed buildings in the park. Estate records from 1590 to 1916 are held by the National Library of Wales. A pre-1850 parish map shows little settlement outside Walton East village, but shows Walton West a short distance away. In the 1830s there were some 230 inhabitants. The population declined steadily over the next 150 years to 150 in 1961. A map made at the turn of the 20th century shows several farms butting up to the village, several other dwellings and a smithy, as well as church and chapel, and several springs. Parish church The parish church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, has no tower or spire. The present church was built 1849 to 1852, and the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (RCAHMW) describes the church: The parish is now one of 13 in the present combined parish of Daugleddau, in the Church in Wales Diocese of St Davids.

It is today preserved as an archaeological park in the modern comune of Castelseprio, near the modern village of the same name. It is in the north of Italy, in the Province of Varese, about 50 km northwest of Milan. Visitors in the apse, 2017 The fame of Castelseprio lies in the Early Medieval frescoes contained in the apse of the small Church of Santa Maria foris portas, which were only rediscovered in 1944. These frescoes are of exceptional rarity and artistic significance, and show strong Byzantine influence. The dating of the frescoes and the origin of their painter or painters remain controversial, although the first half of the 9th century seems to be emerging as the most likely date. In 2011, the church - and the castrum with the Torba Tower - became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of a group of seven inscribed as Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.). In 2006, the Italian Ministry of Culture in a submission to UNESCO, said:  History  Church of Santa Maria foris portas Castelseprio originated as a Roman fort that commanded an important crossroad. During the early Middle Ages, the Lombards occupied the Roman fort, turning it into a fortified citadel or small town. At one point coins were minted there - a sign of its importance. The Church of Santa Maria foris portas (\\"foris portas\\" meaning \\"outside the gates\\" in Latin) which contains the famous frescoes, lay just outside the walls of the citadel. The early dedication of the church to Mary is an assumption; the first documented mention of a church dedicated to Mary in Castelseprio (which is assumed to be this one) comes from the 13th century. The whole citadel was completely destroyed by Ottone Visconti, Archbishop of Milan, after he captured it in 1287, to prevent it being used again by his rivals. Investigations into the church, which began in 1934, finally uncovered the famous Byzantinesque frescoes below later plaster in 1944. The whole area is now an archaeological zone containing the remains of the walls and of the much larger three-aisled 5th-century Basilica of San Giovanni Evangelista. There is also a baptistry of the 5th to 7th centuries dedicated to St. John the Baptist. This has two fonts, perhaps for the use of different Rites, and is octagonal with a small apse to the east. A third Church of San Paolo has a central hexagonal plan and was built between the 6th and 12th centuries. There are some ruins left from the castle. Nearby is a large tower, once used as a convent. Frescoes  The rear of the church, with the apse. When the Church of Santa Maria foris portas was investigated in 1944, it was found to contain, as well as later frescoes, a highly important and sophisticated cycle of fresco paintings showing very strong Byzantine influence. =Style= It is thought by some scholars, including Leveto, that two different hands can be detected, but the origins of these artists are uncertain and subject to speculation. The frescoes are sophisticated, expressive and confident. The artists adapt traditional compositional types to the particular site without strain or disproportion. Poses are natural and rhythmic, and the whole has \\"a great ardor and conviction, an intense response to the human meaning of the subject\\" (Schapiro). While some aspects of the frescoes, notably the iconography, are clearly Byzantine, others may draw on the Christian art of Syria or Egypt. The frescoes also have significant aspects which relate most closely to the late antique art of Italy. Several of the buildings are successfully foreshortened, and the relationship between buildings and figures is more effectively managed than in most Byzantine painting. The painting is done with unusual freedom compared to most Byzantine work; it is this feature in particular which relates to much earlier works from the late antiquity such as paintings found in the catacombs of Rome. The Nativity scene Some art historians see the style as coming from the tradition of Alexandria, from which no other painting on a similar scale remains. John Beckwith is somewhat less enthusiastic than some art historians, describing the frescos as \\"wholly competent\\" and worthy of comparison with 7th century works in RomeBeckwith, 156 He believed the \\"drapery folds ... a complex series of angular ridges emphasized by highlights ... make a decidedly metallic impression, and betray the copyist, who foreshadows in a disturbing way tenth-century mannerisms\\".Beckwith, 157 =Subjects= The Byzantinesque frescoes are located around the curved wall of the apse, and the inward surface of the arch between the apse and the main body of the church. The condition of the frescoes is variable; some parts are well-preserved whilst others are missing completely, or barely visible. Much of the painted area has been pitted to provide a key for the subsequent plastering-over (see the lower area in the middle of the Presentation scene). The subjects of the missing or fragmentary scenes are a matter of some scholarly controversy with some writers proposing that these scenes made up a cycle on the Life of the Virgin, and others one on the Life of Christ; these views are described below. The frescoes are in three registers, the middle register being interrupted by three arched windows. They represent a cycle of the Nativity of Christ and may also have represented early aspects of the Life of Mary, or of Christ. The lowest register has a decorative frieze below which there are a few remains in the centre showing painted curtain railings and religious symbols. This register may not have contained figures. The upper and middle registers contain narrative paintings. The cycle may have been part of a larger scheme of decoration which once included the outer face of the arch and the other walls of the church. Annunciation and incomplete Visitation. Trial by Bitter Water, a rare subject. Upper register of narratives: *1) Over the main arch, on the side inward to the apse, rather than in the body of the church, is a Hetoimasia,From Greek ·ºëœÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±œÉŒØŒ± \\"preparation\\": an iconographic motif in Christian art representing an empty throne. or Throne of God with symbols on it, in a roundel, with an archangel on either side, flying in a \\"victory\\" pose. Then, on the curved wall of the apse, reading left to right: *2) Annunciation and Visitation - right side incomplete * missing roundel, which possibly contained the bust of Mary *3) Trial by Bitter Water - left side incomplete *4) Bust of Christ Pantocrator, in a roundel over central window of the eastern apse. Below the window in the lowest register are traces of a painted exedra containing a Gospel book on a cushion.Castelseprio Website *5) Dream of Saint Joseph * missing roundel, which possibly contained the bust of John the Baptist. *6) Journey to Bethlehem - incomplete on the right Middle Register On the curved wall, reading from right to left : *7) Nativity, and Annunciation to the shepherds *8) Presentation of Jesus at the Temple Fragmentary remains of two frescoes which may have been: *9) The Flight into Egypt. or (in the Marian interpretation) The Birth of the Virgin) *10) The Massacre of the Innocents or (in the Marian interpretation) The Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple) On the two inner faces of the apsidal arch : *11) Adoration of the Magi, on the inner face of the right side of the arch. *12) on the inner face of the left side of the arch - remnants perhaps from The Dream of the Magi or (in the Marian interpretation) the Rejection of Joachim's Offerings at the Temple) Chronological sequence The alternative chronological sequences of the ten narrative scenes would run as follows: *Nativity of Christ: 2,5,3,6,7,8,11,12,9,10 *Life of Mary: 12,9,10,2,5,3,6,7,8,11 In the Marian version the three missing scenes come at the start of the story, rather than the end. Neither sequence follows a consistent chronological sequence on the wall. Joseph's (first) dream and the trial by bitter water come chronologically between the Annunciation and the Visitation. The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple should, according to Leviticus have happened on the fortieth day after the birth. The timing of the visit of Magi is not mentioned in the Gospels, and apocryphal writings placed it between seven days and two years after the Nativity. The Eastern church, and by the Gothic period the Western church also, at least in art, placed it very soon after the birth, so that the Magi, like the shepherds, are included in Nativity scenes themselves. At this date, however, the Western church tended to place the arrival of the Magi later, though certainly before the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents. Some departure from chronology to enable thematic or typological connections to be emphasised is a common feature of medieval picture cycles. The Marian interpretation Joseph's Dream scene Some scholars, notably P.D. Leveto,Leveto op cit. interpret the cycle as being \\"Marian\\", that is, part of the Life of Mary, rather than specifically representing those scenes associated with the Nativity. Evidence for this interpretation is the presence of the rarely depicted scene of the \\"Trial by Bitter Water\\". With this interpretation, the three missing narrative scenes would have had a different content, and the sequence itself would be differently ordered, moving from the left-hand side of the arch to the first two scenes of the lower register, through the top register and then to lower right-hand scenes and finishing with the Magi scene on the opposite side of the arch. In this proposed arrangement, the two scenes of the Birth and Presentation at the Temple of Mary are visually balanced with each other, whilst the Presentation and the Trial by water above it are concerned with Mary's virginity. Also balanced are the two scenes of offerings on either side of the arch wall; in both cases the figures are placed to make their offerings away from the empty arched space, to keep the visual attention focused within the apse. =Dating= In 1950, soon after the frescoes were first discovered, a poll of the scholars who attended a conference in Castelseprio showed a rough split between dates in the 7th and 10th century, although the extreme range of dates that have been suggested stretches from the 6th to the 14th century - an almost unprecedented range in medieval art history. Since that time, the range of possible dates has narrowed significantly. Radio-carbon dating of timber and thermoluminescent dating of roof tiles suggest that the church was built in the early to mid-ninth century.Leveto. n.2 - The average estimated date for the tiles was 828, and the timber gave 865 +/- 87, so between 778 and 952. While providing a reasonably sound date for the church structure, this can only be \\"terminus post quem\\" for the frescoes, which may have been added later. However, the rough finish on the interior stonework leads many scholars to believe that the frescoes were added as part of the original building programme. Bust of Christ. A \\"terminus ante quem\\" was provided by the discovery of graffiti scratched into the fresco plaster recording a number of clerical appointments, the earliest of which is dated (by the name of the presiding Archbishop of Milan) to 948 at the latest. Many writers feel that a certain interval must have elapsed after the painting of the cycle before the clergy would have treated the paintings in this way. Many art historians have pointed to a relationship between the frescoes and two closely related manuscripts, namely the Joshua Roll (Vatican Library, Ms palatine gr. 431) and the Paris Psalter (Biblioth√®que nationale de France Ms Grec. 139) . However, the dating of both manuscripts is likewise controversial. The art historians Kurt Weitzmann and Meyer Schapiro agreed that the artistic quality of the frescoes is superior to that of either manuscript. The Journey to Bethlehem, a scene that in most cycles had already turned into the Flight to Egypt. Kurt Weitzmann preferred a date shortly before 945, and postulated a connection with a marriage between a Lombard princess and a Byzantine prince, which took place in 944. He favoured as the artist an unknown Constantinopolitan artist, trained in the same workshop as the artists of the two manuscripts, on a visit in connection with the marriage. Schapiro preferred a date between the 7th and 9th centuries, in 1957 settling on the 8th century. Most recent writers, relying on the analysis of the timber and roof tiles mentioned above, prefer the first half of the 9th century. Some writers believe the work may have been done by Greek refugees long settled in Italy, or by Italians trained by such artists. Others believe that artists fresh from the Byzantine world were responsible. =Aspects of the works= Almost every aspect of the frescoes, from the clothing to the treatment of the nimbus or halo around the infant Christ, has been analysed and compared to other works in great detail. Some examples are: * The inscriptions naming various figures are in Latin, and in Roman script, but the midwife at the Nativity is named as \\"EMEA\\", the \\"E\\" (\\"H\\" in the Greek alphabet) being a form of the Greek for \\"the\\". In the Byzantine period it is common to find Greek inscriptions naming figures in paintings which include the definite article. The Greek form of the inscription would be: \\"H MAIA\\". * The treatment of the architectural elements within the paintings has been compared to Hellenizing work produced for Moslem patrons in the 8th century, at the Great Mosque in Damascus and elsewhere. * The legend of the doubting midwife, whose withered arm is miraculously cured, shown in the Nativity scene, probably appears only in art from the West during this period. * The Ordeal of the bitter water is otherwise extremely rare in Western iconography, and this is one of the latest of the few Byzantine depictions.G. Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I, 1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 56 & figs, . Schapiro mentions also 10th-century frescoes in Cappadocia. Schiller describes this scene as \\"unknown in Western iconography\\" (p57), but there is a miniature of it in a French 13th century Life of the Virgin in St Petersberg (Fr.Fv.XIV.9 F8r), illustrated in T. Voronova and A Sterligov, Western European Illuminated Manuscripts (in the St Petersberg Public Library), 2003, Sirocco, London The legend comes from the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James and occurs, in the fully developed story, after the Dream of Joseph, in which an angel reassures Joseph who is disturbed to discover Mary's pregnancy, since he knows he has not slept with her. In the legend, others also notice the pregnancy and to dispel gossip and accusations, the priests of the Temple (where Mary had formerly been a temple maid) make the couple undergo the trial of drinking \\"bitter water\\" ‚Äî their reaction to which will prove or disprove their innocence. Naturally they pass. The idea of the trial is clearly based on Numbers 5, 11 ff.Schiller op. cit p57 The legend was part of some Western medieval religious dramas, in which the \\"detractors\\" then drank the water, with horrible results. An example is the N-town Pageant series manuscript in the British Library, London (BL MS Cotton Vespasian D.8), which is mid-15th century from the East Midlands of England.Modernised version of the text of the scene from the N-town Pageant series in the British Library, London (BL MS Cotton Vespasian D.8). Mid-15th century from the East Midlands of England. See also Introduction page on the site.

Population: The increase of population is due to the merger of three neighboring inhabited localities into the town in 2004. Geography The city is located on the Moskva-Oka plain, in the center of the East European Plain, south-east of the capital, 37km from the center of Moscow, on the Moscow - Kashira highway and the Paveletsky suburban railway line, near the federal highway, M-4 \\"Don\\". Most of the town is located to the west of the railway line. The town stretches from north to south along the railroad tracks on 26 kilometers. The climate is moderate continental, with cold, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The frequent passage of cyclones from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean sometimes causes an increase in cloud cover. Average mid- January temperature is about -10,5 ¬∞C, and mid-July is +17,5 ¬∞C. The average duration of the frost-free period is 130 days. Soil is alluvial, gray forest. Water resources are virtually non-existent. The main rivers that flows in the area are Rozhayka, Severka and Pakhra Rivers. History The name of the modern town, Domodedovo which was incorporated in 1900, was given after nearby village with the same name, was first mentioned around 1401 in the spiritual literacy of Vladimir the Bold, Prince of Serpukhov and Borovski.–î—É—Ö–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è –≥—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç–∞ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–∞ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤–∏—á–∞ –•—Ä–∞–±—Ä–æ–≥–æ, –∫–Ω—è–∑—è –°–µ—Ä–ø—É—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ –ë–æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ –∫—Ä–∞–µ–≤–µ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã ¬´–ò—Å—Ç–æ–∫–™¬ª The modern city is located on the old road, Kashira way, that for centuries connected Moscow with Kashira and many other southern cities. In the 17th century within the town of Domodedovo two villages existed: Nazarevo () and Sknilovo (). The exact date of their disappearance is unknown. In 1781, during the administrative reform of Catherine II a city called Nikitsk was founded on site Kolych—ëva village and was a district seat in the Moscow Governorate. The Nikitsky District included Domodedovo village as well as Nikitskoye, Bityagovo and Zaborye which were part of the territory of today's Domodedovo District, and directly, on the territory of the town itself. Almost until the middle of the 19th century the town area was overgrown with small bushes and deciduous trees. During 1861 the peasant reform, on part of the land that belonged to the town of Podolsk in Domodedovo District, the Domodedovo palace forest dacha was formed. Domodedovo was founded in 1900 as a settlement next to a train station of the same name. It was called after a nearby village of Domodedovo, which is known to have existed since 1410. It was granted town status in 1947. The Domodedovo International Airport is located a few kilometers away from Domodedovo proper. In 2007, a referendum on the building of a toll motorway within the city limits took place, where 95% of the inhabitants voted against.Results of the referendum A group of residents of Domodedovo have announced the establishment of the \\"Russian Democratic Republic\\"The name is alternatively transliterated as \\"Ruski\\" by various sources. and asked the European Union for official recognition.http://en.ria.ru/russia/20121001/176339100.htmlhttp://prod- euronews.euronews.net/2012/10/08/russian-village-in-independence- bid/http://eng.rusadvocat.com/node/132 Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with 139 rural localities, incorporated as Domodedovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #11/2013-OZ The administrative division was established on April 1, 2011 as a result of abolishing Domodedovsky District, the territory of which was re- organized as the town under oblast jurisdiction.

She is the first woman and American to win the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for her novel Theory of War. Biography =Personal life= Born Joan Brady on 4 December 1939 in San Francisco to Mildred Edie Brady and Robert A. Brady. She has one sister, Judy. Before becoming an author, she was a dancer with the San Francisco Ballet and the New York City Ballet then went on to study philosophy at Columbia University in New York City. In 1963, she married author Dexter Masters, her mother's former secret lover. In 1965 they moved to England, and together had a son, Alexander Masters, who authored Stuart: A Life Backwards. Her husband died in 1989, and she currently lives in Oxford, England.Theory of War 1996 Abacus edition author notes =Works= Her first published book was The Impostor in 1979. In 1982, she published her autobiography, that appears under both the titles The Unmaking of a Dancer and Prologue: An Unconventional Life'. Her third book and second novel, Theory of War, was hailed as a \\"modern work of genius\\" and earned the Whitbread Novel of the Year award, as well as the Whitbread Book of the Year award. This book also won the French Prix du Meilleur Livre √âtranger and a US National Endowment for the Arts grant. It tells the story of her grandfather, a white child sold as a slave right after the Civil War when the Emancipation Proclamation meant that African Americans could no longer be sold, and so many soldiers had died in the war that there were thousands of orphans. The psychological consequences of such a background‚Äîfor the slave himself and for the generations that followed him‚Äîare the main concern of the novel. Two novels followed, Death Comes for Peter Pan, an expos√© of medical abuse in America, and The Emigre, the adventures of a conman. Bleedout is her first thriller. She started writing crime fiction during a legal battle over fumes from a nearby shoemaker from which she won a large settlement. Bleedout takes place against a backdrop of political and corporate corruption and follows two men, one a murderer, another his mentor in the process of being murdered as the action progresses. Its sequel Venom, published in 2010, introduces the theme of pharmaceutical ruthlessness in pursuit of a cure for radiation poisoning.

Biography Milans del Bosch was born into a noble family whose members had held many senior military ranks. He was the grandson of Joaqu√≠n Milans del Bosch. Jaime Milans del Bosch is reported to have repeatedly boasted of how many of his ancestors had participated in coups d'√©tat. In 1934, he entered the Toledo Infantry Academy. As a cadet, he fought in the Spanish Civil War at the Alc√°zar of Toledo, where he was injured during a republican bombing. Shortly afterwards, he received his officer's commission in the Spanish Foreign Legion. In 1941, Bosch joined the Blue Division to fight against the Soviet Union under German command. After the war, he held successive positions as military attach√© in Spanish embassies in Latin American countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay. Promoted to brigadier general in 1971 and major general in 1974, he was appointed commander of the III Military Region (headquartered in Valencia) in 1977, at the rank of lieutenant-general.  Coup d'√©tat of February 1981  In 1981, Milans del Bosch was the only senior army commander who supported the coup d'√©tat attempt without reservation and conducted offensive operations of importance. On 23 February 1981, shortly after Antonio Tejero had stormed the Spanish Congress of Deputies, he ordered tanks onto the streets of Valencia and decreed a state of emergency. After the televised message of King Juan Carlos I, those in the military who had not yet committed themselves decided to remain on the side of the government, causing the coup to fail. Despite the lack of support, Milans del Bosch only surrendered at 5 a.m. on the next day, 24 February.  Court- martial and dishonorable discharge  Milans del Bosch was court-martialled on 8 March 1981. On 3 June 1982, he was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months imprisonment and expelled from the army. Barely nine years later, in 1991, he was pardoned and released due to advanced age. He never expressed remorse for his involvement in the coup. He returned to live in his native Madrid, where he died of a brain tumor in 1997. He is buried at the Alc√°zar of Toledo. On 17 September 2018, after the planned exhumation of Francisco Franco, it was proposed by Podemos to also exhume Milans del Bosch and Jos√© Moscard√≥, but it was rejected by Vox.

He was on the books of Birmingham City, but without playing in the League, and played non-League football for Stafford Rangers, Macclesfield Town, Telford United, Tamworth and Hinckley United. Career Price was born in Coven, near Wolverhampton, and began his football career as a trainee with Bolton Wanderers. He then joined Stafford Rangers, where he made 294 consecutive appearances beginning with his debut game in August 1988. After six seasons and 325 appearances, he joined Second Division club Birmingham City in 1994 for an initial fee of ¬£20,000. Price's time at Birmingham City was mostly spent as an understudy to first-choice goalkeeper Ian Bennett; his only first- team appearance came in the Associate Members' Cup in September 1994, but he received a winners' medal in that competition as an unused substitute in the final. Desire for regular football prompted a move to Macclesfield Town, where he was first choice for most of his four-year spell. Price won the 1995‚Äì96 FA Trophy with Macclesfield, and went on to change division in three consecutive seasons, winning consecutive promotions from the Football Conference and Third Division in 1996‚Äì97 and 1997‚Äì98 followed by relegation in 1998‚Äì99. Price joined Conference club Telford United in December 1999, where he spent nearly two years before moving back to Stafford Rangers in November 2001 as player and community officer. He left Stafford for the second time in March 2004 to return to Conference football with Tamworth. Released by Tamworth at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, Price signed for their local rivals Hinckley United, and made 18 appearances in all competitions before being released in September 2006.

References ","title":"Ferrera di Varese"},{"id":"6700639","text":"The Liturgy of Saint Basil or, more formally, the Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great, is a term for several Eastern Christian celebrations of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), or at least several anaphoras, which are named after Basil of Caesarea. Two of these liturgies are in common use today: the one used in the Byzantine Rite ten times a year, and the one ordinarily used by the Coptic Church. Texts Fresco of Basil the Great in the cathedral of Ohrid. The saint is shown consecrating the Gifts during the Divine Liturgy which bears his name. The various extant anaphoras attributed to St. Basil in the various Eastern Christian rites may be classified into two groups: one which includes the Egyptian texts, and one which includes all other texts. The older Egyptian version was found in 1960 in a Sahidic Coptic, in a 7th-century incomplete manuscript. From this version derived the Bohairic Coptic version used today in the Coptic Church, as well as the Egyptian Greek and Ethiopic versions. The Egyptian Greek version contains several prayers (identical with those in the Byzantine liturgy) expressly ascribed to St. Basil, and from these it may derive its title, and it may be used by the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria before this Church entirely renounced at its own liturgical tradition in favour of the uses of Constantinople. The present Arabic text of this liturgy is a translation from the Bohairic Coptic version. The other group of the Liturgies of Saint Basil includes the Greek version used in the Byzantine Rite, the older Armenian version known as Liturgy of Saint Gregory the Illuminator and an ancient Syriac version. H.Engberding in 1931 suggested that these three versions derives from a lost common source (Œ©-BAS) and his conclusions were widely accepted by scholars. The older manuscript of the Byzantine version is 8th century Codex Barberini Gr. 336, and this text was the ordinary liturgy celebrated in Constantinople before it was superseded in the common use by the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. From this texts derives all the versions used in the Byzantine Rite, such as the Russian and other Slavonic versions, the Georgian version, and the versions used by the Melkite Church in Syriac and Arabic. Always from the Byzantine text derives the Armenian version known simply as Liturgy of Saint Basil. =History= The Anaphora of Saint Basil, in its core structure, arose in the 4th century. Over time, crucial parts of the anaphora were expanded by inserting credal statements. In particular in the prayer after the Sanctus, but also in the expansion of the Anamnesis, which was influenced by the Christological debates of that period. These changes appear to have been influenced by the dogmatic definitions of the Synods of Antioch in 341 and 345. The parts of this liturgy placed before and after the anaphora are generally deemed to be later. With regards to the supposed lost common source (Œ©-BAS) of Byzantine group of versions, Engberding (1931) as well as following scholars as Gabriele Winkler (2005) suggest that the ancient Armenian version (the Liturgy of Saint Gregory the Illuminator) is the one which has better preserved the readings of Œ©-BAS. Gabriele Winkler underlined also direct Syrian influences on this text. On regards the relation between the Byzantine and the Egyptions groups of versions, there is no a clear consensus among scholars: while Winkler supports a certain preeminence of the ancient Armenian version, other scholars such as Engberding and Fenwick suggest that the older Sahidic Egyptian version is roughly correspondent to a hypothetical text from which also Œ©-BAS derived. While there is no historical evidence that Basil of Caesarea was the author of the older Egyptian version, he visited as laymen Egypt in 356-7, and it is therefore possible that there he entered in contact with Egyptian texts which he later modified, tuning the liturgical structure and enforcing a more developed theological structure, so givining origin to the other Basilian versions. =Literary testimonies= A certain reference to a liturgical text which went under the name of Saint Basil is given in a letter of Peter the Deacon, one of the Scythian monks sent to Rome to settle certain dogmatic questions. Writing about the year 520 to the African bishops in exile in Sardinia, Peter, an Oriental, mentions a Liturgy of Saint Basil, which was known and used throughout the entire East, and even quotes a passage from it.Patrologia Latina, LXV, 449 Leontius of Byzantium, writing about the middle of the 6th century, censures Theodore of Mopsuestia because he was not content with the liturgies handed down by the Fathers to the churches, but composed a Liturgy of his own, showing thereby no reverence either for that of the Apostles, or for that composed in the same spirit by Saint Basil.Patrologia Graecae, LXXXVI, 1368 The Quinisext Council, or \\"Council In Trullo\\" (692), in its thirty-second canon draws an argument from the written Liturgy of the archbishop of the church of the C√¶sareans, St. Basil, whose glory has spread through the whole world.Mansi, Coll. Conc., XI, 958 In tracing the history of this liturgy, scholars have been for a long time misdirected by a 16th-century forgery under the name of St. Proclus, Archbishop of Constantinople (434-446). This forgery, as has been demonstrated in 1962 by F. J. Leroy, has to be ascribed to Costantin Palaeocapa and it falsely stated that Saint Basil shortened the length of the liturgy for the slothfulness and degeneracy of men. Byzantine Liturgy The Byzantine Liturgy is used in the countries which were evangelized from Constantinople, or which came under its influence for any considerable period. Since the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom has become the normal liturgy of the Byzantine Church, that of St. Basil is now used only ten times a year: *The five Sundays of Great Lent (Palm Sunday is not considered by the Orthodox to be part of Lent) *On Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday *On the Eves of Nativity (Christmas) and Theophany (Epiphany). However, if the Great Feasts of Nativity or Theophany fall on a Sunday or Monday, the Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated on the day of the feast, and the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is celebrated on the Eve. *On the feast day of St. Basil, which in the Byzantine calendar occurs on the first of January (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, January 1 falls on January 14 of the Gregorian Calendar for the years 1901‚Äì2100). The Liturgy, as it is currently celebrated in the Byzantine Rite differs very little from the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the primary difference being in the silent prayers said by the priest; also the hymn Axion Estin has, since the 14th century, \\"Venerable Gregory Domesticus of the Great Lavra of Mt Athos\\", Retrieved 2017-11-12 been replaced by All of Creation. In general, the prayers of St. Basil are more penitential, and therefore lend themselves to the Church's liturgical preparation for important holy days; hence, their use during Great Lent and on the eves of Nativity and Theophany (both of which are strict fast days, known as Paramony). The service may be divided into the Liturgy of the Catechumens and the Liturgy of the Faithful (the following paragraphs describe only those parts which are specific to the Liturgy of St. Basil): =Differences from the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom= Liturgy of Preparation (Prothesis) *Mention of St. Basil instead of St. John Chrysostom at the removal of particles and at the dismissal Liturgy of the Catechumens *Prayer of the catechumens Liturgy of the Faithful *First Prayer of the Faithful *Second Prayer of the Faithful *Prayer of Fervent Supplication *Anaphora (see details, below), ending with All of Creation and its prayer *Prayer for the Church, ending with the priest's ekphony, \\"And grant that with one mouth and one heart we may glorify and praise...\\" *Prayer at the Ektenia of Supplication *Prayer at the Bowing of Heads *Prayer of Thanksgiving after communion *Dismissal (mentioning St. Basil instead of St. John Chrysostom) *During the Prayers After Communion, the troparion and kontakion chanted are those to St. Basil. Anaphora The Anaphora proper begins after the kiss of peace and the Symbol of Faith (Nicene Creed). It starts with the Eucharistic Preface followed by the Sanctus, the silent prayers for which are quite a bit longer in St. Basil's Liturgy. While the actual Words of Institution themselves are the same for both Chrysostom and Basil, Saint Basil precedes each exclamation with the ekphonesis: \\"He gave it to His holy disciples and apostles, saying\\". The Epiclesis (invocation of the Holy Spirit to perfect the Consecration of the Gifts) differs in that Chrysostom says \\"Make this bread the precious Body of Thy Christ\\" and \\"Make that which is in this chalice the precious Blood of Thy Christ\\", while Basil says \\"This bread is in very truth the precious Body of our Lord, and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ\\" and \\"This chalice is in very truth the precious Blood of our Lord, and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ ‚Ä¶ which was poured out for the life of the world.\\" So for Saint John Chrysostom, the transformation is taking place in the present, whereas for Saint Basil it is already an accomplished fact. The Great Intercession for the living and the dead is much longer in St. Basil. Because of the longer prayers that make up the Anaphora of Saint Basil, the musical settings for the hymns chanted during the prayers are longer and often more ornate than those used during the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. Coptic Liturgy The main liturgy used by the Coptic Church is known as Liturgy of Saint Basil. The term Liturgies of Saint Basil in a Coptic context means not only the sole anaphora with or without the relater prayers, but also the general order of the Divine Liturgy in the Alexandrine Rite. =Anaphora= The Egyptian (or Coptic) anaphora of Saint Basil, even if related and using the same Antiochene (or \\"West Syrian\\") structure, represents a different group from the Byzantine, West Syrian and Armenian grouping of anaphoras of Saint Basil. The Egyptian version does not derive directly from the latter and has its own peculiarities: its text is more brief, with less Scriptural and allusive enhancements, and it lacks well defined Trinatarian references, which are typical of other versions and reflect the theology of the First Council of Constantinople of 381. The structure of the Bohairic Coptic version used today in the Coptic Church can be summarized as follow: *Anaphora: **the Opening Dialogue **the Preface, praising Father as Lord and everlasting king, as creator of heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them (quoting ), and as Father of Christ by whom all things were made. **the Pre-Sanctus, praising the Father on his throne of glory and worshiped by the Angelic hosts, so introducing **the Sanctus, conducted without the Benedictus, **the Post-Sanctus, recalling the whole history of Salvation, from the Original Sin to the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection of Christ up to the Last Judgment, **the Institution narrative, **the Anamnesis, referring to the Passion, Resurrection and Second Coming of Christ, **the Oblation, offering to the Father the Eucharistic gifts, **the Epiclesis, asking the Holy Spirit to come and to sanctify and manifest the gifts as the Most Holy. The Holy Spirit is then asked to make the bread the Body and the chalice the Blood of Christ, **the Intercessions, praying for the participants to become one single body, for the Church, for the Pope of Alexandria and for all the ecclesiastic hierarchy, for the town and the harvest, for the floodings, for the living, for who have offered the Eucharistic gifts, for the saints - naming Mary, John the Baptist, Saint Stephen, Saint Mark and Saint Basil. Then the diptychs are read, followed by the prayers for the dead, **a prayer for the fruit of the Communion and the final doxology. The 7th-century Sahidic Coptic version found in 1960 shows an earlier and more sober form of the Bohairic text: the manuscript, incomplete in its first part, begins with the Post Sanctus, and is followed by a terse Institution narrative, by a pithy Anamnesis which simply lists the themes and ends with the oblation. The next Epiclesis consists only of the prayer to the Holy Spirit to come and manifest the gifts, without any explicit request to change the gifts in the Body and Blood of Christ. The intercessions are shorter and only Mary is named among the saints. =Divine Liturgy= The term Liturgy of Saint Basil may refer also to the whole Eucharistic Liturgy which by the Coptic Church has the following structure: Offertory Offertory (or Prothesis) is the part of the liturgy in which the Sacramental bread (qorban) and wine (abarkah) are chosen and placed on the altar. All these rites are Middle-ages developments. It begins with the dressing of the priest with vestments and the preparation of the altar, along with prayers of worthiness for the celebrant. At his point is chanted the appropriate hour of the Canonical hours, followed by the washing of the hands with its prayer of worthiness, and by the proclamation of the Nicean Creed. Then takes place the elaborate rite of the choosing of the Lamb: while the congregation sing 41 times the Kyrie eleison, the priest checks the wine and chooses among the bread one loaf which will be consecrated (the Lamb). The Lamb is cleaned with a napkin and blessed with the priest's thumb wet of wine. Afterwards the priest takes the Lamb in procession around the altar and the deacon follows with the wine and a candle. At the altar, the priest, with appropriate prayers, blesses the Lamb and the wine, places the Lamb in the Paten and pours wine and a few water in the chalice (the chalice is stowed into a wooden box named ark on the altar). The last part of the offertory resembles an anaphora: after a dialogue, the priest blesses the congregation and proclaims a prayer of thanksgiving, giving thanks to God for his support to us, and asking him for a worthy participation to the liturgy. Then comes the prayer of covering, said inaudibly by the priest, which has the form of an epiclesis, asking God to show his face on the gifts, and to change them in order that the bread and wine may became the Body and Blood of Christ. This text might come from an ancient anaphora or simply be a later High Middle Ages creation. The paten and the ark with inside the chalice are here covered with a veil. Liturgy of the Catechumens In the Liturgy of the Catechumens the readings from the New Testament are proclaimed. This portion of the Divine Liturgy was in the ancient times the beginning of the liturgy, and the only part which could be attended by the catechumens. This part is roughly equivalent to the Liturgy of the Word or Mass of the Catechumens in the Western Rites. It begins with a Penitential Rite in which first the priest prays inaudibly Christ for the forgiveness of sins (The Absolution to the Son) and then all the participants kneel in front of the altar and the celebrant, or the bishop if present, recites a prayer of absolution (The Absolution to the Ministers). The reading from the Pauline epistles is preceded by the offering of incense at the four sides of the altar, at the iconostasis, at the book of the Gospel and at the faithfuls in the nave; in the meantime the faithfuls sing a hymn to Mary and a hymn of intercession. The Pauline epistle is followed by a reading from the Catholic epistles, and by one from the Acts of the Apostles. Another offering of incense is conduced (the Praxis Incense), similar to the Pauline incense except that only the first row of the faithfuls is incensed. A reading from the Coptic Synaxarium can follow. After these readings, the Trisagion is sung three times, each time with a different reference to the [Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, thus addressing the Trisagion to Christ only. After the Trisagion follows a litany, the recital of a Psalm and the singing of the Alleluia, and finally the proclamation of the Gospel from the doors of the sanctuary. The sermon may follow. Liturgy of the Faithful The Liturgy of the Faithful is the core of the Divine Liturgy, where are placed the proper Eucharistic rites. It begins with the prayer of the Veil, in which the priest offers the liturgical sacrifice to God. The Long Litanies follows, where all pray for the peace, for the ecclesiastic hierarchy and for the congregation. The Nicean Creed is proclaimed, the priest washes his hands three times and sprinkles water on the congregation reciting the Prayer of Reconciliation which is a prayer of worthiness for all who attend the liturgy. Next is the Kiss of peace during which the faithful sing the Aspasmos Adam (Rejoice O Mary) hymn. The Anaphora is conduced. After the anaphora takes place the consignation, i.e. the moistening of the Lamb with some drops of the consecrated Wine, which is show to the worship of the faithful. The Fraction of the consecrated Lamb ensues, during which the priest says a prayer which varies according to the Coptic calendar. All of the congregation stands and prays with open hands the Lord's Prayer. To be prepared for partaking of the Eucharist, the faithful bow while the celebrant says in low voice the prayer of submission, then the priest and the participants offer each other a wish of peace and the priest inaudibly prays the Father for the forgiveness of sins (The Absolution to the Father). The Elevation reminds the one of the Byzantine Rite, with the celebrant who raises the portion of the Lamb engraved with a cross (the ispadikon) crying: \\"The holy things for the holy ones\\". The priest makes a second consignation and puts gently the ispakidon in the chalice (the commixture), then he recites aloud a Confession of faith. The partaking of the Eucharist follows, first the Body of Christ given to the celebrants, to the deacons and to the faithful who approach the sanctuary without shoes and then the Blood of Christ in the same order. Psalm 150 is sung in the meantime. The distribution of the Eucharist ends with a blessing with the Paten. The dismissal rites include The Prayer of Laying the Hands and the final blessing. Armenian Liturgy Not used since about the 10th century, the Armenian Church had additional anaphoras, one of which known as the Liturgy of Saint Basil, which was mainly the Byzantine text translated into Armenian.

He fought through the entire Civil War and saw action in many battles. Today, he is best known for his enduring memoir, \\"Co. Aytch\\" (1882), which recounts his life as a soldier in the First Tennessee. Life In May 1861, 21 year old Sam Watkins of Maury County, Tennessee, rushed to join the army when his state left the Union. He became part of Company H (or Co. \\"Aytch,\\" as he called it), 1st Tennessee Infantry regiment, and would fight from Shiloh to Nashville and was one of only seven men who remained in the company when it was surrendered to U.S. Major-General W. T. Sherman in North Carolina, April 1865. When he died at 62, Watkins was buried with full military honors. \\"Co. Aytch\\" In 1881, with a \\"house full of young 'rebels' clustering about my elbows,\\" Watkins began to chronicle his experiences in the First Tennessee Regiment. \\"Co. Aytch\\" is considered to be one of the greatest memoirs ever written by a soldier of the field. Originally published as a serial newspaper column from 1881 to 1882 in The Columbia (Tennessee) Herald, his stories were collected and printed in book form in 1882. The charming prose captures the experience of the common private soldier, from the hardships of camp life to the horrors of battle, the camaraderie of a unit to the loss of a brother, the pride in one's state to the devastation of defeat. Legacy Camp No. 29 (established 1986) of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Columbia, Tennessee, is named after him. In popular culture Watkins is often featured and quoted in Ken Burns' 1990 documentary titled The Civil War, and also in the film titled Civil War: The Untold StoryCivil War: The Untold Story http://civilwartheuntoldstory.org . (See specific quotes from Watkins in Wikiquotes .) The song \\"Kennesaw Line\\" by Don Oja-Dunaway, tells a heart- breaking vignette of the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on the morning of June 27, 1864, from the perspective of Sam Watkins, with part of the lyrics directly paraphrasing his description from the book \\"Company Aytch\\" (see the section entitled \\"Dead Angle, on the Kennesaw Line\\").For example, in the book he wrote, \\"Well, on the fatal morning of June 27th, the sun rose clear and cloudless, the heavens seemed made of brass, and the earth of hot iron, and as the sun began to mount toward the zenith, everything became quiet, and no sound was heard save a peckerwood on a neighboring tree. ... \\" The corresponding lyrics: > Well the sun rose high above us that morning > On a clear and cloudless day > A peckerwood, he tapped on a tree > That would soon be shot away > The heat blistered down through the leaves on the trees > The air seemed hot enough to catch fire > Heaven seemed to be made of brass > The sun rose higher and higher > The best-known version of this song is sung by Claire Lynch on the album \\"Lines & Traces\\" by the Front Porch String Band.

He also served the university as Provost (from 2015 to 2017), Pro Vice Chancellor (Student Experience) and Head of the College of Arts, Humanities and Law. Before going to Leicester, he was Professor of Modern Cultural and Social History and Head of the School of the Arts at the University of Liverpool and a Professor and Head of the School of Historical Studies in the Faculty of Arts at Monash University in Australia. He holds degrees from Flinders University (BA (Hons), 1980 and MA, 1983), Johns Hopkins University (MA, 1985) and Melbourne University (PhD, 1993) and was appointed a full Professor in 2007. He was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia in 2008 and became a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2010. Peel's interest in student transition to university education led to a report in the federal government's Higher Education Series in 1999 and a research project on school-leavers' experiences of university teaching. Peel has also contributed to debates about history teaching and curriculum, especially through his paper \\"The Essentials of Australian History\\", which formed part of the 1999 National Inquiry into School History, through his work as an advisor on Australian history to the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority and through two surveys on university curricula and teaching for the Australian Historical Association. In 2008, the Australian Learning and Teaching Council awarded him one of its Citations for Outstanding Contributions to Student Learning, for \\"sustained contributions to the imaginative teaching of history, and to the transition, progress and welfare of students in his own and other universities\\".

It falls within a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies. Presentation An inherited disorder associated with the deposition of a steroid known as cholestanol in the brain and other tissues and with elevated levels of cholesterol in plasma but with normal total cholesterol level; it is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia beginning after puberty and by juvenile cataracts, juvenile or infantile onset chronic diarrhea, childhood neurological deficit, and tendineous or tuberous xanthomas. Genetics CTX is associated with mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, located on chromosome 2q33-qter. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 2 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis Elevated levels of serum cholestanol are diagnostic of CTX. Alternatively analysis of 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7 alpha hydroxycholesterol can be used. Genetic testing of the CYP27A1 gene is confirmatory and is increasingly being used as a first line test as part of symptom specific gene panels (genetic eye disease, ataxia, dementia). Treatment The standard treatment is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) replacement therapy. Serum cholesterol levels are also followed. If hypercholesterolemia is not controlled with CDCA, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (\\"statins\\" such as simvastatin) can also be used.

This enzyme is located in many different tissues where it is found within the mitochondria. It is most prominently involved in the biosynthesis of bile acids.  Function  CYP27A1 participates in the degradation of cholesterol to bile acids in both the classic and acidic pathways. It is the initiating enzyme in the acidic pathway to bile acids, yielding oxysterols by introducing a hydroxyl group to the carbon at the 27 position in cholesterol. In the acidic pathway, it produces 27-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol whereas in the classic or neutral pathway, it produces 3Œ≤-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid. While CYP27A1 is present in many different tissues, its function in these tissues is largely uncharacterized. In macrophages, 27-hydroxycholesterol generated by this enzyme may be helpful against the production of inflammatory factors associated with cardiovascular disease.  Clinical significance  Mutations in CYP27A1 are associated with cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, a rare lipid storage disease. Inhibitors of CYP27A1 may be effective as adjuvants in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer due to inhibition of the production of 27-hydroxycholesterol (which has estrogenic actions and stimulates the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells). Some marketed drugs that have been identified as CYP27A1 inhibitors include anastrozole, fadrozole, bicalutamide, dexmedetomidine, ravuconazole, and posaconazole.

Titus Labienus is considered responsible for naming Mombello too, after a battle against the Gauls (\\"mons belli\\" means \\"war hill\\"). A different interpretation says that the meaning is \\"monte bello\\", that is \\"beautiful hill\\". In the 19th century, Laveno Mombello was home to important ceramic industries. Today, it is a port town that connects the province of Varese with Verbania and the famous Borromean Islands across Lake Maggiore. The municipality was formed in 1927 to encompass the previously separate centres of Laveno, Mombello and Cerro.

On 25 June 1861 they were officially reorganized by the state as part of the uniformed militia of the state, and attached to the First Brigade of the Battalion of Artillery commanded by Maj.

When war with the United Kingdom became imminent in 1807, these four companies, with other volunteers, were temporarily organized as a regiment, commanded by Col. Peter Curtenius, and remained thus detached until 20 April 1809. In 1812 the battalion became the 2nd Battalion, 11th Regiment of Artillery, New York State Militia. In 1812-14 the regiment was deployed in the harbor forts of New York. On 25 August 1824, the battalion was named Battalion of National Guards (its distinctive name until, in 1862, the legislature appropriated it for the uniformed militia) in tribute to the Marquis de Lafayette. Gray uniforms were adopted and the intention to become a regiment was declared. In December 1824, the fifth company was organized, and Captain Stevens' company, of the 11th New York Artillery, transferred to it as the sixth company. In January 1825, the battalion was transferred to the 2nd New York Artillery. On 1 October 1825, the battalion was detached and organized as a separate and independent battalion, and during the month the seventh company was organized. On 4 May 1826, the organization of the eighth company was completed, and 7 May, the battalion was organized into a regiment, the 27th Artillery. 17 April 1838, a troop of cavalry was admitted to the regiment, which, in 1861, became the ninth company. In 1843, the state furnished the regiment with arms, it having heretofore provided them itself. On 27 July, the designation of the regiment was changed to 7th Regiment. In 1847 the regiment was redesignated the 7th Regiment of Infantry (National Guard), New York State Militia (7th New York Militia). In April 1849, an engineer corps was organized, which was revived and reorganized 1 March 1855. A tenth company, Company K, was organized 29 March 1860. 19th Century active service The regiment was frequently ordered to hold itself ready for service, and did active service for the United States, the state and New York City, as follows: * United States service from 15 September to 15 December 1812 * from 2 September to 2 December 1814 * in support of state or municipal authority: execution of James Reynolds, 19 November 1825 * at the Election Riots, 10 April 1834 * Abolition Riot, 11 to 12 July 1834 * Great Conflagration in New York city, 17 December 1835 * Stevedore Riot, 24 February 1836 * Flour Riots, 6 February and 6 March 1837 * Anti-rent War, 9 to 10 December 1839 * Croton Water Riot, 22 to 23 April 1840; * Great New York City Fire of 1845, 19 to 21 July 1845 * Astor Place Riot 10, 12 and 14 May 1849 * Police Riot 16 June 1857 * Dead Rabbits Riot 5 July 1857 * Quarantine War 3 September 1858 http://www.thehistorybox.com/ny_city/riots/sectionII/riots_article4a.htm * preserving order at camp of Spinola Brigade 12 to 19 September 1862 * Draft Riots, July 1863 * Orange Riots, July 1871 * Labor Riots, July 1877 * Motormen's Strike, Brooklyn, January 1895, * strike at Croton Dam, April 1900 * service in the War of the Rebellion.Miriam Medina: The History Box (accessed September 2010), The Riots of New York Civil War After organizing and brief training, the regiment, commanded by Colonel Marshall Lefferts, left New York City for Washington, D.C., on special call of President Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1861, arriving in Annapolis Junction, Maryland, and opening communications with Washington April 24-25.See also James M. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom (book), Oxford University Press, 1988, 286. There it was mustered in the service of the United States for thirty days, 26 April 1861; it served at Washington and was mustered out at New York city, 3 June 1861. 25 May 1862, the regiment, still commanded by Col. Lefferts, again left the state, and was mustered in the United States service at Camp Hamilton, Va., 29 May 1862, for three months, from 26 May 1862. It served most of this time at Baltimore, Md., and was mustered out of the United States service, 5 September 1862, at New York City. 16 June 1863, it again re-entered the United States service, and was mustered in at New York City, for thirty days. It left the state on the 17th, under the command of Colonel Lefferts, served at Baltimore, and Frederick, Md., in the 2d Separate Brigade, Middle Department, 8th Corps, and was mustered out of the United States service, 20 July 1863, at New York City. In its service, in 1861, it lost one enlisted man, accidentally killed, and it took part in the advance into Virginia on 24 May 1861.Frederick Phisterer (1912) New York in the War of the Rebellion 3rd ed., Albany, J.

Lyon Company (Digitized by Google Books) The regiment was housed in the Capitol Buildings at Washington from April 25-May 2, and was mustered into Federal service on April 26, serving duty at Camp Cameron, Meridian Hill, Georgetown Heights, from May 2-23\\\\. After occupation of Arlington Heights, Virginia, May 24-26, it assisted in building Fort Runyon and was mustered out at New York City on June 3, 1861. 7th Regiment Memorial, Central Park The regiment was again mustered in for three months' service on May 25, 1862. It left New York City for Baltimore, Maryland, on May 26, and then was attached to Dix's Command, Middle Department, to July 1862. Then, it was assigned to the 8th Army Corps, Middle Department, to September 1862. It was in camp at Stewart's Hill, Baltimore, from May 28 to June 5, and duty at Fort Federal Hill from June 6 to August 28. The regiment mustered out in New York City on September 5, 1862. Once again, the regiment was mustered in, this time for thirty days' service starting June 16, 1863, and departed for Baltimore on June 17. It was attached to Morris' Brigade, 8th Army Corps, Middle Department, to July 7, and then to the 3rd Division, 3rd Army Corps, Army of the Potomac, to July 15. It was on duty at Fort Federal Hill and provost duty in Baltimore from June 18 to July 5 before being ordered to Frederick, Maryland, on July 5, and picket and outpost duty there until July 14. It reached New York City on July 16. The 7th was on duty during the New York Draft Riots from July 16-21\\\\. The regiment mustered out for good on July 21, 1863. The Headquarters of the 7th during the Civil War was at the Tompkins Market on Third Avenue. In 1879, it was moved uptown to the newly built Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue.NYS Military Museum, Historic Armories https://dmna.ny.gov/historic/armories/NewYorkCityParkAvenue7thRegiment.html Then First Lieutenant Rufus King, Jr. during the American Civil War One noteworthy member of the regiment, who left a body of paintings of the regiment's service, was Sanford Robinson Gifford; another was Rufus King, Jr. who was awarded the Medal of Honor. Also a member as a private during the spring 1861 deployment to Washington was Robert Gould Shaw, later commander of the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Later service After the Civil War, the 7th Regiment continued as a unit of the New York State National Guard. In 1858 it briefly occupied Staten Island in response to the destruction of the country's largest quarantine facility, an episode known as \\"The Quarantine War.\\" It was noted for its military efficiency as well as the social status of its members. Pre-World War I members included August Thayer Iaccaci and his brother Paul IaccaciThe Aerodrome In 1917 the regiment was called into federal service and redesignated the 107th Infantry Regiment. q.v. The 107th Infantry served in combat in France as part of the 27th Division during World War I. The 107th Infantry was demobilized in 1919 and continued as a unit of the New York National Guard. In 1940 the unit was re-designated as the 207th Coast Artillery Regiment. During World War II the 207th Coast Artillery was reorganized into several units which serve in both Europe and the Pacific theaters. In 1946 the 107th Infantry Regiment was reestablished forms the major portion of the 107th Regimental Combat Team of the New York National Guard. In 1957 the 107th Infantry is reorganized as 1st Battalion, 107th Infantry and assigned to the 42d Infantry Division. 1st Battalion, 107th Infantry was deactivated in 1993. Frank Buckles, the last surviving American World War I veteran, may have served with the regiment from 1922 to 1923.

With an average height of , it has narrow glossy green leaves up to long and high pale yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appearing in autumn. As the spikes age, their flowers fall off and they develop up to 50 follicles, each of which contains two seeds. Alex George described the plant in his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia as a variety of Banksia integrifolia, but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic studies show it to be related to Banksia plagiocarpa, Banksia oblongifolia and Banksia robur. The species is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. It is rarely cultivated. Description Banksia aquilonia grows as a tall shrub or small tree up to high, though plants up to have been recorded. It has hard, fissured, grey bark, and narrow elliptic or lanceolate leaves measuring long by wide with entire (straight) margins and acute tips. They are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent midrib covered in red-brown hair. The brownish new growth appears in summer. The plant is in bloom from March to June. Flowers occur in Banksia characteristic vertical flower spike, an inflorescence made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B. aquilonia flower spike is a pale yellow colour, roughly cylindrical, high, and up to in diameter. The tubular perianths of the individual flowers are long. These open at maturity (anthesis) to release the styles. All old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on the bare woody spike. The follicles measure long, high, and wide. Furry at first, they become smooth with age and open when ripe, and their two half-oval valves split to release the one or two seeds they contain. The obovate dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwich a woody separator. Measuring long, they are made up of a wedge-shaped seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons around long. Juvenile leaves are narrower, measuring long and wide, and often have serrate (toothed) margins. Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia are similar to B. integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences‚Äîthe midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally arranged on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B. integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough for it to be separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B. integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B. aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B. integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification. =Variants= Field volunteers for The Banksia Atlas recorded plants with large adult and juvenile leaves up to long along the Tully to Mission Beach Road, and a population of smaller shrub-sized plants to high with small narrow leaves long and wide at Coronation Lookout in Wooroonooran National Park, plants with normal morphology occurring further down the mountain. Taxonomy Banksia aquilonia was first described by Alex George in 1981 as a variety of Banksia integrifolia (coast banksia), from a specimen collected at Witts Lookout in Crystal Creek National Park south of Ingham on 12 April 1975. The species name is the Latin adjective aquilonius, meaning \\"northern\\", as it was the most northerly form of B. integrifolia. In 1996 Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a cladistic analysis of Banksia based on morphology, in which this taxon stood out as the only member of B. integrifolia to be both morphologically and geographically distinct from other infraspecific taxa. They also noted that there were no intermediate plants between what was then known as B. integrifolia var. aquilonia and other populations of B. integrifolia. On this basis they would have liked to promote it to species rank, but did not because their inferred phylogeny suggested that this taxon arose from within B. integrifolia. They were unwilling to render B. integrifolia paraphyletic by elevating this taxon to species rank, and they were equally unwilling to elevate all four varieties to species rank, since the others all had significant overlaps in distribution and morphology. Therefore, they simply promoted all four to subspecies rank. This example has since been held up as an interesting case study on how the concept of species should be defined, as it presents the problem of \\"a monophyletic group comprising a paraphyletic basal group of incompletely differentiated geographic forms within which is nested at least one divergent, autapomorphic taxon that invites treatment as a species.\\" George promoted it to species rank on the basis of its distinctive leaf arrangement and midrib in 1996. Thus its full name with author citation is \\"Banksia aquilonia (A.S.George) A.S.George\\". It is placed in subgenus Banksia, section Banksia and series Salicinae. Its placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia ::::Series Salicinae :::::Banksia dentata \\\\- Banksia aquilonia \\\\- Banksia integrifolia \\\\- Banksia plagiocarpa \\\\- Banksia oblongifolia \\\\- Banksia robur \\\\- Banksia conferta \\\\- Banksia paludosa \\\\- Banksia marginata \\\\- Banksia canei \\\\- Banksia saxicola ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae :::Section Coccinea :::Section Oncostylis''' ::Subgenus Isostylis Despite initially assigning Banksia aquilonia to be variety of B. integrifolia, George noted that it had affinities with the then newly described species Banksia plagiocarpa, with which it co-occurs on and near Hinchinbrook Island in north Queensland. Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia aquilonia formed a clade with B. plagiocarpa, B. oblongifolia and B. robur, rather than B. integrifolia. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. aquilonia is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Common names include northern banksia, white banksia, honeysuckle or white bottlebrush. A local aboriginal name is jingana, in the Jirrbal and Girramay languages. Distribution and habitat Range of Banksia aquilonia Banksia aquilonia occurs in coastal areas of northern Queensland from the Cedar Bay National Park to Paluma Range National Park, in areas with an annual rainfall of . It occurs from near sea level to an altitude of , in a variety of habitats and aspects. It grows in wet sclerophyll forest or rainforest margins, on plateaus, ridges, slopes and low- lying swampy areas on sandy or rocky soils, generally of granitic origin, or sometimes clay. It commonly grows with tree species such as the pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia), forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis), swamp turpentine (Lophostemon suaveolens), forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), and black sheoak (A. littoralis), and understorey species such as coin spot wattle (Acacia cincinnata) and yellow wattle (A. flavescens). Much of its lowland habitat in the Wet Tropics has been degraded or fragmented. Although the range overlaps with B. dentata, the two species are not known to occur together. Ecology Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. Regeneration from root suckers has also been recorded. Unlike many banksia species which release their seed after bushfires, Banksia aquilonia sets seed when the follicles mature. Banksia inflorescences are energy-rich sources of food, and B. aquilonia nectar is a likely food item of the endangered mahogany glider (Petaurus gracilis), as well as many other mammals and birds. Avian species observed visiting the flower spikes include the bridled honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, eastern spinebill and rainbow lorikeet. Cultivation Banksia aquilonia adapts readily to cultivation in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at four to six years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a pot, with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.

Initially established to provide religious education for Black children, their apostolate developed to address the needs of the neglected poor of all nationalities. Their emphasis is on catechetical and social work. History =Founding= Around 1888, widowed Catholic convert Anna Frances Hartwell moved from Chicago to Baltimore to do social work and conduct catechism classes for the city's black population, at the request of Rev. John R. Slattery, Superior General of the Saint Joseph's Society of the Sacred Heart. She and four other women formed a religious community under the name of Mission Helpers, Daughters of the Holy Ghost, dedicated to providing religious education for black people. The convent was on Biddle Street in Baltimore. They were known as \\"the Tan Sisters\\" for their tan habits. In 1893 Hartwell assumed the title Mother Joseph.\\"Ministry to African Americans in the Jim Crow South\\", CUA Baltimore native Mary Frances Cunningham discovered that the black children in her southwest neighborhood were excluded from religious education classes at St. Martin's Church.\\"Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart Celebrate 125 Years of Service\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando She began to teach the children, first on the church steps, and then in the basement.Tilghman, Mary K., \\"For 125 years, Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart in Towson, have followed the call\\", Towson Times, September 24, 2015 Cunningham joined the Mission Helpers in 1891, taking the name Sister Mary Demetrias. One of the group's first efforts was to open an industrial school for girls to teach workplace skills so that they could help support their families. They also established a professional laundry that provided employment for local women. In 1895, the name of the institute was changed to 'Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart'. Their ministry was expanded to assisting the neglected poor regardless of race. Hence, their field of missionary and catechetical labour was greatly broadened. Father Slattery, whose apostolate was focused on the black population, was unenthusiastic about this change in direction. The Mission Helpers consulted James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, and in 1896 he assigned Rev. Peter Tarro to replace Slattery as spiritual director. They established daycare centers for the children of working mothers, and in 1896 provided catechism classes to Italian immigrants. In 1897, at the request of Cardinal Gibbons, St. Francis Xavier's school for the deaf. This was the first such Catholic institution in the ecclesiastical province of Baltimore.\\"History\\", Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart =Expansion= In 1902 the sisters established a foundation in Puerto Rico and opened a school for the deaf there also. This was a heavy undertaking, as the demands on the sisters for missionary and catechetical work in Porto Rico were very great, and the need urgent. They were the first community of Catholic sisters in the Marianas and Micronesia, arriving on Guam in 1905. The Government welcomed the presence of American sisters who could teach English and assist in the public health efforts of the government. However, much of the work was not the ministry for which their community was founded, and some of the sisters had not adapted well to the tropical climate. They were recalled to Baltimore in 1908.Forbes OFM, Eric. \\"First sisters in the Micronesia region\\", Guampedia, August 05, 2010 At the first general chapter of the institute, which was held on 5 November 1906. A constitution was adopted, and a superior general and her assistants elected. At this first election Mother M. Demetrias was chosen as mother general. The community was then officially declared canonically organized. On account of their missionary labours the sisters were unable to keep up the work of perpetual adoration, consequently it was decided to schedule it to the First Fridays. In 1922, they purchased the Boyce mansion from the Deford family in West Towson, Maryland. A portion of the land was sold in on 1981 to the Blakehurst senior community, and a new motherhouse built next door. In New York, the Sisters ran St. Pascal Day Nursery in Manhattan, and the Mount Mongola summer camp in Ellenville. They established a house in Venezuela in 1962. Sister Rosalia Walsh developed the \\"Adaptive Way\\", a method to teach religion in a way appropriate to a child's age. The program has been adopted by catechists in a number of dioceses. Present Day The Mission Helpers are based in West Towson, Maryland. Their annual crab feast at the Towson American Legion has become a local tradition.

History =Origins of the clan= The Lindsays were prominent in both England and Scotland from the late 11th century. The name most likely derives from the region of Lindsey in England (the name of which comes from the Old English for \\"island of Lincoln\\") though it could also refer to the village of Lim√©sy in Normandy. Sir Walter de Lindissie accompanied David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, to claim his throne. Walter's great-grandson, Sir William de Lindsay, sat in the Parliament of 1164 and was later a justiciar. William Lindsay held the lands of Ercildum, Crawford and Luffness. The chief's premier title was later Earl of Crawford. Sir William Lindsay sat in Parliament as Baron of Luffness in East Lothian. He probably had two wives, and through his wife Alienora de Limesi came David de Lindsay.The Scots Peerage: Founded on Wood's ed. of Sir Robert Douglas's Peerage of Scotland; containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom by Paul, James Balfour, Sir, 1846‚Äì1931 Sir William Lindsay's son was Sir David de Lindsay who married a member of the royal family named Marjory. David died in 1214 and was succeeded as Lord Crawford and High Justiciar of Lothian by his son who was also called David. This David also inherited the English estates of Limesay and Wolveray. One of his descendants was another Sir David Lindsay who was Chamberlain of Scotland in 1256. =Wars of Scottish Independence= The aforementioned David Lindsay's grandson was yet another David whose seal was appended to the letter of 1320 to the Pope, asserting the independence of Scotland, that was more often known as the Declaration of Arbroath. His second son, Sir James Lindsay, married Egidia, daughter of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and Marjory Bruce, daughter of Robert The Bruce and Isabella de Mar, and half-sister of Robert II of Scotland, son of Robert the Bruce and his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh. =14th, 15th and 16th centuries= In 1390, Sir David Lindsay famously took part in a tournament at London Bridge, in the presence of Richard II of England. At the tournament Lindsay won the day and the admiration of the English king. Lindsay was created Earl of Crawford on 21 April 1398. In 1403, he was Lord High Admiral of Scotland and in 1406, he was sent as an ambassador to England. The Lindsays fought at the Battle of Arbroath in 1445.Arbroath canmore.rcahms.gov.uk. Retrieved 23 July 2013. In 1452, Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford, joined in a rebellion against James II of Scotland and fought at the Battle of Brechin where the royal forces were victorious. Alexander Lindsay was attained for treason but was later pardoned. The fifth Earl of Crawford rose high in royal favour. He was successively Lord High Admiral of Scotland, Master of the Royal Household, Lord Chamberlain and High Justiciary. The sixth Earl of Crawford was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, while on close attendance to King James IV. =17th century and civil war= Ludovic Lindsay, 16th Earl of Crawford, learned his trade as a soldier on the Continent. He later fought for King Charles I during the civil war where he commanded a cavalry regiment at the Battle of Marston Moor. He was later captured supporting James, Marquis of Montrose, at the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645. The earldom of Crawford was succeeded to by his kinsman John Lindsay, Earl of Lindsay. The Crawford title remained with this branch of the family until it passed to the Earl of Balcarres in the 19th century, who were descended from a younger son of the ninth Earl of Crawford. This branch of the family had been created Earls of Balcarres in 1650 for services during the civil war. =18th century and Jacobite risings= The first Earl of Balcarres was made hereditary governor of Edinburgh Castle. He was also made Secretary of State for Scotland and High Commissioner to the General Assembly. His younger son was Colin Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Balcarres, who was a staunch Jacobite and fought during the Jacobite rising of 1715. He only escaped being attained for treason through the intervention of the Duke of Marlborough who was a lifelong friend of his.

The large building is the former naval prison. Seavey's Island in 1893 Seavey's Island, site of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, is located in the Piscataqua River in Kittery, Maine, opposite Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It encompasses . History What is today called Seavey's Island was originally five separate islands conjoined to accommodate the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Colonists originally used the rocky islands for collecting wild berries or drying fish on fish flakes. When Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert decided to create the first federal shipyard in 1800, he authorized the purchase for $5,500 of Fernald's Island (also called Dennett's Island). The largest of the five, Seavey's Island, would be annexed in 1866 and give the grouping its familiar name. Approved by Congress in 1900, a granite drydock was built in the former gut between Fernald's and Seavey's islands. Clark's, Jamaica and another island were attached to Seavey's. Shipyard dry dock, c. 1908, built in the former gut which separated Fernald's and Seavey's islands Atop a hill on the southern end of Seavey's Island stood an earthwork defense called Fort Sullivan, built in 1775 to supplement Fort William and Mary and Fort McClary in the protection of Portsmouth Harbor during the Revolution and, later, War of 1812. After 1815 it was abandoned, then reactivated from 1861 until 1865 during the American Civil War as an 11 gun, 8 inch Rodman naval battery. Another early battery was to the west on Henderson's Point. But on July 22, 1905, the point was blown up in what was then the largest dynamite explosion ever attempted. Because it projected into the Piscataqua River channel, Henderson's Point created a navigational hazard for warships visiting the navy yard. Consequently, a cofferdam was constructed, behind which of rock and of soil were excavated. Explosives were detonated to remove the rest, with debris flying in the air. Within seconds, the river was widened by . Spanish Navy prisoners of war arriving at Seavey's Island in 1898 In 1908, the Portsmouth Naval Prison was completed on the southern side of Seavey's Island at the former site of Camp Long, a stockade named for Secretary of the Navy John Long, where 1,612 prisoners of war from the Battle of Santiago de Cuba were confined from July 11 to mid-September 1898 during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Camp Heywood, a Marine camp named after Colonel Charles Heywood, was located just north of the naval prison. It was occupied after the 1st Battalion's return from Cuba in late August until September 21, 1898. According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has 62 buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Seavey's Island was the subject of a border dispute between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001, in which New Hampshire asserted that the island lay within the borders of New Hampshire. The State of New Hampshire brought suit against Maine in the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court held that New Hampshire was estopped from contesting a previous 1977 boundary determination that Maine had jurisdiction over the island, and dismissed the Complaint.New Hampshire v. Maine (U.S. 2002) (holding New Hampshire estopped from re-litigating 1977 consent judgment confirming Maine's ownership.)

He is best known for his group the Bill Wells Octet, since the early 1990s, but he has performed and recorded in a wide range of settings, including collaborations with The Pastels, Maher Shalal Hash Baz, Future Pilot A.K.A., Lol Coxhill, Isobel Campbell, Barbara Morgenstern and recently Aidan Moffat. He has also played on tracks by Kevin Ayers, V Twin and Duglas T. Stewart. Biography Wells is completely self-taught, and began performing in clubs in Scotland in the late 1980s. He began arranging his own work and initially offered these to Bobby Wishart, but when Wishart declined the offer, Wells formed his own Bill Wells Octet, which has included Lindsay Cooper, Alastair Morrow, Robert Henderson, John Longbotham, Phil and Tom Bancroft., and his Big Band that entered the BBC Big Band contests of 1992 and 1993 recording one CD at the Society of Musicians in Glasgow. Wells' style of experimental jazz takes influences from Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, Gil Evans, and Charles Mingus. The Octet's releases have primarily been live recordings sold by Wells at gigs. Wells has collaborated with several prominent Scottish independent rock and pop musicians, including with David Keenan of Telstar Ponies and John Hogarty of BMX Bandits in the group Phantom Engineer, and with Stevie Jackson and Isobel Campbell of Belle & Sebastian in live performances and also in the studio; Wells recorded the Ghost of Yesterday album with Campbell, and Jackson played on Wells' Incorrect Practice album. During 2006 he received a Scottish Arts Council 'Tune Up' commission for a tour of Scotland with a group of Japanese musicians Maher Shalal Hash Baz.

Dario Fo, Nobel Prize in literature of 1997, spent his childhood and adolescence here, and the little village played a central role in the development of his artistic specificity and production. In fact, it was the mix of people from different countries, working at the local, renowned blown glass factory and speaking an array of languages, that inspired the creation by Fo of the Grammelot, an original new idiom mixing a number of regional dialects.

He was the son of Karl, Prince of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen, who abdicated in favour of his son on 27 August 1848, and his first wife Marie Antoinette Murat, niece of Joachim Murat. Life After only slightly over a year ruling his family's small principality, Karl Anton abdicated in December 1849 in favor of his distant cousin, the King of Prussia, and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, along with the neighboring principality of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, was annexed by Prussia. After his abdication, Karl Anton became a prominent figure in Prussian politics. After the fall of the reactionary Manteuffel ministry in 1858, and the accession of Prince William as regent for his incapacitated brother, King Frederick William IV, a new, moderately liberal ministry was appointed, with Karl Anton as Minister- President. The Prince continued in this role until 1862, when he resigned in the midst of a struggle with parliament over the military budget. After this, Karl Anton largely resigned from active politics and focused on his role as head of the Catholic branch of the Hohenzollern family, accentuated by the extinction of the Hohenzollern-Hechingen line in 1869. In 1866, his second son, Karl, was offered the throne of Romania, where he would rule for nearly forty years as Carol I. A few years later, in 1870, his eldest son, Leopold, was given a similar offer of the Spanish throne. This so-called \\"Hohenzollern candidacy\\" for the Spanish throne was one of the main factors in instigating the Franco-Prussian War. Marriage and issue Prince Karl Anton was married to Josephine Friederike Luise, Princess of Baden (1813‚Äì1900), daughter of Grand Duke Charles of Baden. *Leopold (1835‚Äì1905). *Stephanie (1837‚Äì1859) - married Peter V of Portugal. *Karl (1839‚Äì1914), future King of Romania. *Anton (1841‚Äì1866), died in battle. *Friedrich (1843‚Äì1904). *Marie (1845‚Äì1912) - married Philippe of Belgium.

This center included groups led by Stephen Altschul (another BLAST co- author), David Landsman, Eugene Koonin (a prolific author on comparative genomics), and L. Aravind. He is most well known for his work on a series of sequence similarity algorithm, starting from the Wilbur-Lipman algorithm in 1983, FASTA search search in 1985, BLAST in 1990, and Gapped BLAST and PSI- BLAST in 1997. Lipman also works with Dennis A. Benson and others at NCBI, contributing to the maintenance and improvement of GenBank and annually publishes a paper on their progress. The improvements include specification of data format, curation of data, integration of protein information with DNA sequences and scientific literature. He was one of the originators of the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project, a project to sequence and make available the genomes of thousands of influenza virus isolates. He was one of the original signatories of the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing. He is also the Editor-in-Chief for an open access, peer reviewed online scientific journal called Biology Direct. In May 2017, it was announced that Lipman would leave his role at the NCBI to join plant-based meat company Impossible Foods as Chief Scientific Officer. Awards and honors Lipman received the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Award for outstanding contributions to Biomolecular Technologies in 1996. In 2004, he was awarded the ISCB Senior Scientist Award and elected an ISCB Fellow in 2009 by the International Society for Computational Biology. In 2005, Dr. Lipman was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences. In 2013, he received the award of a White House \\"Open Science\\" Champion of Change.

During the first half of the 20th century, it was one of the few resorts in the country where African-Americans were allowed to vacation and purchase property, before discrimination was outlawed in 1964 through the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The surrounding area is within Manistee National Forest. The community encompasses Lake Idlewild, and the headwaters of the Pere Marquette River extends throughout the region. Called the \\"Black Eden of Michigan\\",http://www.iaacc.com/letters/idlewild.htm from 1912 through the mid-1960s, Idlewild was an active year-round community and was visited by well-known entertainers and professionals from throughout the country. At its peak, it was one of the most popular resorts in the Midwest and as many as 25,000 would come to Idlewild in the height of the summer season to enjoy camping, swimming, boating, fishing, hunting, horseback riding, roller skating, and night-time entertainment. When the 1964 Civil Rights Act opened up other resorts in many states to African-Americans, Idlewild's boomtown period subsided. Though not quite a \\"ghost town\\" as claimed in the book Ghost Towns of Michigan, Chapter 7,https://archive.org/stream/GhostTownsOfMichiganVolume1/Ghost-Towns-Of- Michigan_djvu.txthttp://www.iaacc.com/events.html the population was under 1,000 in 2019,https://www.bestplaces.net/people/zip- code/michigan/idlewild/49642 and numerous buildings were vacant. The Idlewild African American Chamber of Commerce,http://www.iaacc.com/ founded in 2000 by John O. Meeks, continues to promote existing local businesses and seeking new ones. It is also striving to attract more visitors to the area, with events and other strategies, in hopes of resuscitating the once lively town.https://nypost.com/2017/06/11/the-abandoned-black-eden-is-prepared-for-a- comeback/  Establishment (1912 ‚Äì 1920s) Idlewild was founded in 1912. During this period, a small yet clearly distinguishable African American middle class ‚Äì largely composed of professionals and small business owners ‚Äì had been established in many urban centers, including several in the American Midwest. Despite having the financial means for leisure travel, racial segregation prevented them from recreational pursuits in most resort destinations in the region. Seeing an opportunity, four white land developers and their wives organized the Idlewild Resort Company (IRC). Erastus and Flora Branch, Adelbert and Isabelle Branch (from nearby White Cloud, Michigan), Wilbur M. and Mayme Lemon, and A.E. and Modolin Wright (of Chicago), organized IRC during the pre-World War I era. To secure land rights, Erastus Branch built a cabin, homesteaded the land for three years, and eventually obtained the title to the land through his Branch, Anderson & Tyrrell Real Estate Company, which became the central focus of the resort community. One folk saying suggests that the community's name refers to \\"idle men and wild women\\". Current residents embrace this version of the story by selling playful T-shirts with this phrase at the annual Idlewilders summer festivals. IRC organized excursions to attract middle class African American professionals from Detroit, Chicago, and other Midwestern cities, taking them on tours of the rustic community, and selling lots. Their ads in major news media offered lots at $1 down and $1 per month, and cited the hunting, fishing, boating and horseback riding opportunities.https://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/john- carlisle/2014/11/30/idlewild-michigan-hard-times/19668773/ A 1919 pamphlet used by IRC to promote the community, entitled \\"Beautiful Idlewild\\", describes it as \\"the hunter's paradise\\" renowned \\"for its beautiful lakes of pure spring water\\" and \\"its myriads of game fish\\". Promoters of the area also emphasized the lack of prejudice and the freedom of movement for blacks \\"without ostracism and hatred\\", in a town where they could truly feel like \\"American citizens\\".https://books.google.ca/books?id=WaQwDAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA91&dq;=Highland+Maryland+The+Land+Was+Ours:+charles+douglass&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi_r_r7iMvgAhUn5YMKHSYTAY0Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q;=Highland%20Maryland%20The%20Land%20Was%20Ours%3A%20charles%20douglass&f;=false, page=93 One prominent personality to relocate to Idlewild was Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, who in 1893 was the first surgeon in the United States to perform open-heart surgery. Williams, Herman O. and Lela G. Wilson of Chicago, three of Williams' associates from Chicago and Cleveland, and twenty others were among the first group of African American professionals to join IRC's excursion. Later, tours were conducted by train from Chicago, Indiana, Detroit, Grand Rapids, St. Louis, and other cities. Madame C.J. Walker, the first self-made U.S. woman millionaire of any race, owned property in Idlewild, Michigan. IRC had acquired over of land. The company sold a good deal of that land, and then turned the island in Idlewild Lake over to Williams and Louis B. Anderson of Chicago, and Robert Riffe and William Green of Cleveland, who collaboratively formed the Idlewild Improvement Association (IIA) and helped build the clubhouse. IIA sold property to such notables as NAACP co-founder W.E.B. Du Bois, cosmetic entrepreneur Madam C.J. Walker, Fisk University president Lemuel L. Foster, Albert B. Cleage Sr. of Detroit, Fannie Emanuel of Chicago, and novelist Charles W. Chesnutt. 3 IIA was also responsible for recruiting other middle-class professionals, such as NAACP field secretary William Pickens, H. Franklin and Virginia Bray (a missionary and his wife who together founded the first formal church in Idlewild), and the Reverend Robert L. Bradby, Sr. of Second Baptist Church of Detroit (who contributed to the development of the Idlewild Lot Owners Association). IIA encouraged this new influx of community leaders to foster racial pride, economic development, decency, and respect to Idlewild. The annual Idlewild Chautauqua was organized by Baptist Minister Reverend Robert L. Bradby in the 1920s and 1930s. These week-long events added an intellectual flavor to the recreational life in the community, attracted people from across the country, and were praised by Michigan Republican Governor Fred W. Green.  The height of popularity (1920s ‚Äì 1964) After segregation and enforced segregation of Jim Crow laws made it nearly impossible for African Americans to thrive in American society, many searched for a safe haven. Idlewild became a place where one could be within miles of prominent cities such as Chicago, while remaining concealed within the surrounding woods of the newfound African American community. As this new black intelligentsia began to settle in the community, some relocated as activists and members of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), some as followers of Du Bois' National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), others as believers of the late Booker T. Washington's political machine, and others as potential investors. For the majority of these professionals who brought their families, the idea of land ownership conveyed black social status and membership in this community, something that enforced segregation prevented African Americans from obtaining beyond the community of Idlewild. Eventually, Idlewild would become known as the \\"Black Eden of Michigan\\". Idlewild gained national stature among African Americans during the period between the World Wars. For example, the Idlewild Land Owners Association had members from over thirty-four states in the country. In addition, the Purple Palace, the Flamingo, the Paradise Club, Idlewild Club, Rosanna Tavern, and Pearl's Bar provided summer entertainment for tourists and employment opportunities for seasonal and year-round residents in the community. The Pere Marquette Railroad built a branch line to the area by 1923, a post office opened that same year, and the Idlewild Fire Department was established soon after. Following the flow of these significant establishments, a host of new entrepreneurs began entering the community. With new establishments on the rise, and the growing population of people, Idlewild began to mirror the appearance of a prominent American society. By the mid 1920s, over 6,000 people had purchased some 17,000 lots in the area. The Pere Marquette Railway ran the Resort Special with sleeping cars from Chicago and Detroit via Grand Rapids from June to September, stopping in Baldwin five miles to the west.http://detroit1701.org/Idlewild.html The Pere Marquette Railway ran trains west from Idlewild's station to Baldwin, then Ludington; and trains went east to Saginaw. At Saginaw the trains were timed to meet with separate Bay City-originating trains to Detroit. The PM's successor, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ended the Ludington to Saginaw trains through Idlewild in the latter months of 1949. Following World War II, Idlewild attracted what some sociologists have labeled the new African American \\"working\\" middle class. With the construction of a few paved roads in Idlewild, a reinvestment in the township's only post office, and greater availability of electricity, a new generation of entrepreneurs began to invest in Idlewild. Phil Giles, Arthur \\"Big Daddy\\" Braggs, William N. \\"Sunnie\\" Wilson and a host of other African American businessmen and women took advantage of the market by purchasing property on Williams Island and Paradise Gardens, and began developing these areas into an elaborate nightspot and business center. (According to one reliable source, Braggs financed his Idlewood business with revenues from illegal activities.) In 1952, the Detroit Idlewilders Club was founded by Sunnie Wilson and other prominent Detroiters who spent their summers in Idlewild. The founding purpose of the group was to aid in support of charitable and civic endeavors and promote social entertainment and recreation in Idlewild. The cottage started by Albert Cleage in the 1940s was expanded by his sons Louis, Hugh, and Henry. In a 2017 interview, local businessman John O. Meeks recalled the past. \\"At its high point, between the '40s and early '60s, nearly 30,000 folks would descend on here in the summer. Hundreds of black-owned businesses thrived. This place was hopping ... We had a roller- skating rink for the kids, our own fire department and a post office\\". Other sources indicate 25,000 visitors as a more common number during peak times in summer. Many African American entertainers of the period performed in Idlewild, particularly at the Paradise Club managed by Arthur Braggs. (The Flamingo Club, managed by Phil Giles, had lesser-known entertainers, although LaVern Baker and Detroit‚Äôs \\"Queen of the Blues\\", Alberta Adams, did perform there.)https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/idlewild- michigan-1912/ The list included Della Reese, Al Hibbler, Bill Doggett, Jackie Wilson, T-Bone Walker, George Kirby, The Four Tops, Roy Hamilton, Brook Benton, Choker Campbell, Lottie \\"the Body\\" Graves, the Rhythm Kings, Sarah Vaughan, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Dinah Washington, B.B. King, Aretha Franklin, Fats Waller, and Billy Eckstein. Many other performers, entertained both Idlewilders and white citizens in neighboring Lake County townships throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. Arthur Braggs produced singers, dancers, showgirls, and entertainers who performed in the Fiesta Room at the Paradise Club from May to September, starting in summer 1950, helping Idlewild become the \\"Summer Apollo of Michigan\\". Not all club patrons were black, as one resident recalled. On some nights, \\"there were more white people in there than blacks. It wasn‚Äôt about race, it was about fun\\". The Paradise Club showgirls and chorus girls, with guest entertainers, performed not only in Idlewild but also on the road in the off-season as the Arthur Braggs Idlewild Revue. The appeared in cities such as Montreal, Toronto, Boston, Kansas City, Chicago and to New York; in Manhattan, the group performed at the Apollo Theater. Braggs' show helped Idlewild become a major entertainment center and contributed to the financial prosperity of the area. Some of the amenities in Idlewood were advertised in The Negro Motorist Green Book.  Decline and redevelopment efforts (1964 ‚Äì present) Following the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, business in Idlewild declined. Other vacation resorts were beginning to accommodate African-American visitors, and with federal law requiring that they be accepted anywhere, African Americans began taking advantage of this opportunity. Many went to the Florida beaches and Las Vegas casinos, for example, limiting the number arriving at Idlewild. According to National Public Radio, \\"it was integration that killed Idlewild. Blacks no longer had to remain invisible\\".https://www.npr.org/2012/07/05/156089624/black-eden-the- town-that-segregation-built In 1966 Idlewild lost its last nearby train access in Baldwin when the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway terminated service on its Grand Rapids-Traverse City route (shortened from its Petoskey terminus), with a timed transfer in Grand Rapids to Chicago-bound trains.Cheseapeake and Ohio/Baltimore and Ohio timetable, April 1966, Table 4 The national recession in the early 1970s further contributed to an economic downturn in Idlewild, which led to a population decline as local employment options dwindled. Idlewild became a lesser-known family vacation and retirement community, primarily attracting retirees who remembered it from its boom period. In the 1970s township officials organized a planning commission, zoning board, and other initiatives as a way to encourage community input and to offer specific practical solutions to improve the community. Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) were obtained for demolition, additional roadwork, and other structural changes, which resulted in a complete makeover of the island, renamed \\"Williams Island\\" in honor of early community leader Dr. Daniel Hale Williams. In the 1990s, with federal and state funding scarce, attention was turned away from building projects toward the renovation of existing township properties. The federal government designated Lake County as an \\"Enterprising Community\\", which facilitated the development of sewer and natural gas systems. Businessman John O. Meeks purchased and renovated the Morton Motel, and founded organizations to develop and promote the community, including Mid- Michigan Idlewilders and the Idlewild African American Chamber of Commerce. Nonetheless, by 1998, the economy was in a \\"dismal state\\" according to a reliable source, with many residents on welfare. By that time, the Paradise Club had been torn down and the Flamingo had been closed down. The state of Michigan invested funds for a 10-year strategic plan for Idelwild completed in 2013 as the Tourism Development Strategy For Idlewild, Michigan.https://savingplaces.org/stories/whats-next-for-idlewild-michigans- black- eden#.XG1hmqJKipohttp://ced.msu.edu/upload/Idlewild_final_report_6-20.pdf The Idlewild Historic and Cultural Center is open Saturdays in 2019 and offers a self-guided driving tour of the community with stops including the remains of the Flamingo Club, the Paradise Club, and some of the previous homes of prominent individuals.https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/idlewild-michigan The National Idlewilders Club continues to organize annual events.https://hothiphopdetroit.com/3836608/do-you-know-detroit-idlewild/ The town's store, Road Runners,https://www.facebook.com/The-Road-Runner-Variety- Store-1440061649587871/ is a typical rural one-stop, right now the only store in town. They sell cans of soup, bags of chips, beer and pop, coffee and tea, cigarettes and liquor. The Idlewild Historic & Cultural Center displays memorabilia and photographs of the town's most active years.http://www.historicidlewild.org/ In a 2017 interview with New York Post, Idlewild booster John O. Meeks described the community as follows. \\"We have three motels here now. There used to be 35. We have one restaurant. There used to be 25. I don‚Äôt expect it to be what it once was, but I do believe it deserves a future.\\" Journalist Salena Zito added that \\"Idlewild is not a complete ghost town. Its pristine lakes remain home to a couple of hundred people ‚Äî mostly those left over from its heyday ‚Äî and a few newcomers such as township supervisor Carrington-Atkins, who recently bought the perfectly preserved home of famed black author Charles Waddell Chesnutt. And yet, many of its houses are empty, its storefronts fallen victim to nature\\". In February 2019, East Lansing radio station WFMK described Idlewild as a ghost town \\"due to the vacated neighborhoods: block-after-block of deserted homes and yards. Many whole blocks are completely deserted & vacant except for the crumbling shacks that were once homes\\", confirmed by a series of photos.http://99wfmk.com/idlewild-michigan-2019/ Nonetheless, a series of events was planned for 2019, such as The 5th Annual Idlewild Education, Empowerment and Music Festival weekend (July 13‚Äì14), with guests including an original Braggs Fiesta Doll Dancer,http://seekingmichigan.org/look/2012/01/31/carlean-gill Carlean Gill.https://www.michigan.org/event/idlewild-empowerment-music-festival- weekendhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/5th-annual-idlewild-empowerment-weekend- tickets-55874266435?aff=erelexpmlt A 2011 Black Past article summarized the town's legacy as follows: \\"Despite this decline, Idlewild symbolized the heyday of the combination of race, leisure, and geography to create a briefly prosperous community through niche tourism\\".

Growing to tall and spreading indefinitely, it is an evergreen perennial, frequently used in cultivation as groundcover. Etymology The genus name probably derives from the Latin word vincire, meaning bind, as the long creeping vines were used to prepare garlands. The species name major refers to the larger size in respect of the similar Vinca minor L. Description Vinca major is a trailing vine, spreading along the ground and rooting along the stems to form dense masses of groundcover individually 2‚Äì5 m across and scrambling up to 50‚Äì70 cm high. The leaves are opposite, nearly orbicular at the base of the stems and lanceolate at the apex, 3‚Äì9 cm long and 2‚Äì6 cm broad, glossy dark green with a leathery texture and an entire but distinctly ciliate margin, and a hairy petiole 1‚Äì2 cm long. The flowers are hermaphrodite, axillary and solitary, violet-purple, 3‚Äì5 cm diameter, with a five-lobed corolla. The calyx surrounding the base of the flower is long with hairy margins. The flowering period extends from early spring to autumn. Distribution and habitat This species is found in southern Europe and northern Africa, from Spain and southern France east to the western Balkans, and also in northeastern Turkey and the western Caucasus. These are also found in lower Himalayan ranges in Asia. It prefers moist undergrowth, woodlands, hedgerows and banks along the rivers at an altitude of above sea level. It grows well in full sun and in deep shade. Subspecies There are two subspecies, with geographically separate ranges: *Vinca major subsp. major - leaf petioles finely hairy, hairs short (Southern Europe) *Vinca major subsp. hirsuta (Boiss.) Stearn (syn. V. pubescens d'Urv.) - leaf petioles densely hairy, hairs longer; petals much narrower (Caucasus, northeastern Turkey) The closely related Vinca minor is similar but smaller, with narrower, hairless leaves. Cultivation Vinca major is a commonly grown ornamental plant in temperate gardens for its evergreen foliage, spring flowers, and groundcover or vine use. Many cultivars are available, with differences in flowers, such as white to dark violet flowers, and different patterns and colors of variegated foliage. The cultivar 'Variegata' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

It is especially a common noxious weed 'smothering' native plants and diversity in riparian area and oak woodland habitats of coastal California. It forms dense strands that envelop other plant life and can prevent saplings and shrubs from growing by blocking out the light. Periwinkle moves from place to place, with unintentional human help, in dumped garden waste or as plant fragments carried along in water.Periwinkle, Aliens Among Us.

The discs were played at a phonogram speed of either 33 1/3 rpm or 45 rpm and had a duration of approximately 6 minutes. Private Eye also recorded material released on other configurations including 7\\" vinyl singles, EPs, 12\\" vinyl albums, audio- cassettes and compact disc. The content for the recordings was written and performed by Private Eye staff members, contributors and friends. Among those prominently featured on the classic 1960s and 1970s recordings were: Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Barry Humphries, John Bird, John Wells, Eleanor Bron, William Rushton, Barry Fantoni and Richard Ingrams. In addition to their original releases, some of the recordings have been reissued on vinyl and audio-cassette.

Reissues In 1973, Private Eye pressed a limited edition 12\\" vinyl album titled Private Eye's Golden Years of Sound - containing its first eight flexi-discs. The album was for private circulation only among friends and it was never commercially released. In 1980, comedy producer Martin Lewis, a longtime associate and friend of Private Eye owner Peter Cook acquired exclusive rights to all the Private Eye recordings produced from 1962-1980 and arranged for the commercial release of the first ten flexi-discs on a 12\\" vinyl album to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Private Eye magazine in October 1981. The album - titled Private Eye Presents Golden Satiricals [The Top Ten Flexi-Discs!] was released on Lewis' Springtime Records label, distributed by Island Records. The release included a facsimile of the first-ever issue of Private Eye. In 1998, the flexi-discs album was reissued by Springtime Records as a double audio- cassette set distributed by MCI (Music Collection International) - with the 1962 E.P. \\"Private Eye Sings Private Eye\\" as bonus content.

The three releases were sub- titled Volumes One, Two and Three respectively. All three releases were on audio-cassette only.

Origins of Eurydice Designed by Admiral the Hon. George Elliot, the second Eurydice was a very fast 26-gun frigate designed with a very shallow draught to operate in shallow waters. She originally saw service on the North American and West Indies station between 1843 and 1846 under the command of her first captain, George Augustus Elliot (the eldest son of her designer). In July 1845, she was driven ashore near the Moro, Havana, Cuba. Her guns were taken off to lighten her before she was refloated. Under Captain Talavera Vernon Anson, her second commission between 1846 and 1850 was spent on the South African (\\"Cape of Good Hope\\") station. Her third commission, under Captain Erasmus Ommanney (between 1854 and 1855) and then Captain John Walter Tarleton (1855 to 1857) saw her first sent briefly to the White Sea during the Crimean War and then to the North American and West Indies station again. The Eurydice saw no further seagoing service in the next twenty years; she was converted into a stationary training ship in 1861. In 1877, she was refitted at Portsmouth and by John White at Cowes for seagoing service as a training ship. Loss of Eurydice After being recommissioned under the command of Captain Marcus Augustus Stanley Hare, Eurydice sailed from Portsmouth on a three-month tour of the West Indies and Bermuda on 13 November 1877. On 6 March 1878, she began her return voyage from Bermuda for Portsmouth. After a very fast passage across the Atlantic, on 24 March 1878, Eurydice was caught in a heavy snow storm off the Isle of Wight, capsized and sank. Only two of the ship's 319 crew and trainees survived; most of those who were not carried down with the ship died of exposure in the freezing waters. Captain Hare, a devout Christian, after giving the order to every man to save himself, clasped his hands in prayer and went down with his ship.Agnes Weston: My Life among the Bluejackets, James Nisbett: London, 1909. Page 123 One of the witnesses to the disaster was a young Winston Churchill, who was living at Ventnor with his family at the time. The wreck was refloated later that same year but had been so badly damaged during her submersion that she was then subsequently broken up. Her ship's bell is preserved in St. Paul's Church, Gatten, Shanklin. There is a memorial in the churchyard at Christ Church, The Broadway, Sandown and another at Shanklin Cemetery in Lake where seven crew members are buried. The ship's anchor is set into a memorial at Clayhall Cemetery, Gosport. Two of her crew, DAVID BENNETT AB and ALFRED BARNES OS are buried in Rottingdean St Margaret's churchyard when bodies were washed ashore nearby. There are four in the grave, but only two of the men could be identified. Prelude to a second disaster HMS Atalanta. 1880 An inquiry found that the vessel had sunk through stress of weather and that her officers and crew were blameless for her loss. There was some adverse comment on the suitability of Eurydice as a training ship because of her extreme design, which was known to lack stability. However, she was immediately replaced by another 26-gun frigate of identical tonnage but slightly less radical hull-lines, HMS Juno. Juno was renamed and made two successful voyages between England and the West Indies before disappearing at sea in 1880 with the loss of 281 lives; the ship is believed to have been lost in a storm. Later British seagoing training ships were smaller purpose-built brigs. In literature The Loss of the Eurydice is a major poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ghost ship The phantom Eurydice has been sighted frequently by sailors over the years since her sinking, and she is said to haunt Dunnose, a cape on the Isle of Wight that lies west of Shanklin, close to the village of Luccombe at the southwesterly end of Sandown Bay. Most notably, on 17 October 1998, Prince Edward of the United Kingdom reportedly saw the three-masted ship off the Isle of Wight while filming for the television series \\"Crown and Country\\", and the film crew claimed to have captured its image on film.Harding, John (2004).

However, he is probably best known as the author of the first two books in the six-volume Independent Television in Britain series, widely regarded as the definitive history of the first 37 years of the ITV service. Early life Sendall grew up in the town of Worcester where he attended the Royal Grammar School. He studied Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a first class degree at the age of 20. After leaving Oxford, he studied as a postgraduate at Harvard University. Civil Service Sendall joined the British Civil Service in 1935 and from 1941 to 1945 was Private Secretary to Brendan Bracken, the Minister of Information during the Second World War. After the war, the defunct Ministry of Information was re-established as the Central Office of Information. Sendall helped with the transition and became the Central Office's first Controller between 1946 and 1949. He then went on to act as Controller of the Festival of Britain until 1951 a job for which he was honoured with the CBE in 1952. Television In 1955, Sendall joined the Independent Television Authority, initially as Secretary but later the deputy to the Director-General, Sir Robert Fraser. (Fraser, like Sendall, was one of several senior figures in Independent Television who had previously worked in the information services.) He remained in the post throughout the Authority's metamorphosis into the Independent Broadcasting Authority in 1972 and eventually retired in 1977. On retirement, he was awarded the Royal Television Society gold medal for his durable contribution to television. Sendall wrote and published the first two volumes of Independent Television in Britain, the official history of ITV in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The series was subsequently continued by other writers.

Directed by Ralph Thomas, it is based on two true-life attacks by British commando frogmen, first using Chariot manned torpedoes in Operation Title in 1942, and then X-Craft midget submarines in Operation Source in 1943. Filmed at Pinewood Studios, England, with outdoor scenes in Guernsey, some of the original war equipment was used in the film.  Plot  The Royal Navy (RN) is concerned about attacks on convoys by German submarines while having to keep \\"half the fleet\\" guarding against the German battleship . Tirpitz is 60 miles from the sea inside a Norwegian fjord, and attempts by the Royal Air Force (RAF) to sink her have failed. Commander Fraser (Mills) is determined to prove that attack by human torpedoes is practical, despite scepticism from RN higher echelons. Fraser assembles and trains a force of British commando frogmen officers and ratings to use the Mk I Human Torpedo manned torpedoes (Chariots) at their Scottish base. After being refused permission to attack Tirpitz, due to the RN policy of avoiding unproven weaponry, the team manage to attach dummy limpet mines to the admiral's own ship. Their success results in Fraser's force being authorised to attack Tirpitz with the initial operation using the Chariots. The attack fails and the crew are forced to abandon ship and land in Norway. They walk to neutral Sweden from where they are returned to Scotland. For the next operation, the crews are trained to use small X-Craft submarines: X1, X2 and X3. The three craft are initially towed over the North Sea by conventional submarines and then left to penetrate the fjord where Tirpitz is anchored. They manage to approach undetected to lay their \\"side-cargoes\\" under the ship's hull, each containing two tons of explosive amatol. X2 is badly damaged and cannot re-surface, but the crew decide to stay on board to prevent \\"giving the game away\\". The other two submarines succeed in laying their mines before the crews scuttle them. They are captured by the crew of Tirpitz, to be taken away as prisoners of war. While some German crew are aggressive, attempting to machine gun the men in the water, the captain of Tirpitz salutes them as \\"brave men\\", providing them blankets and schnapps. The mines explode as planned, badly damaging Tirpitz. The crew of the stranded X2, hearing the explosions, attempt to escape. However, X2s side cargoes have flooded, which causes them to spontaneously explode, destroying X2 and killing her crew.

E. T. Warren and James Benson, which had been published in 1953. Director Ralph Thomas says the film was made because producer William MacQuitty \\"was very involved with the Navy and he loved submarines.\\"Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema 1997 p 558 MacQuitty had a production company in partnership with Sydney Box called London Independent Producers, which tended to use the same core creative personnel. They purchased film rights in 1952, before the book had been published. The book became a best seller, selling over 350,000 copies and MacQuitty obtained finance from the Rank Organisation under Earl St. John. The British admiralty provided full co- operation. Thomas was given the job of directing after his tremendous success with Doctor in the House. Several of the cast from that film would appear in Above Us the Waves. Shooting began on 20 September 1954 in Guernsey. Commander Donald Cameron, who commanded X-6 as a lieutenant and won the Victoria Cross during the operation, was an adviser to the film. MacQuitty was an experienced diver, having spent over 500 hours under water. He personally supervised many of the underwater sequences. Events in the film had minor differences, for example, the boat Arthur that carried the Chariot human torpedoes was named Ingebord in the film, and the X-class submarines used in Operation Source in 1943 were numbered X-5, X-6 and X-7, and X-5 was the craft that was lost. The score was by Arthur Benjamin and performed under the direction of Muir Mathieson. John Gregson played an Australian. \\"Australians are husky, types\\", said producer McQuitty. \\"Gregson has made his part of Alec Duffy, midget submarine commander, good and husky.\\" \\"I am proud to be playing the part of an Australian\\", said Gregson. \\"During the war, when I was in the Royal Navy, I met many Australian fighting men. They were good fellows.\\" Donald Sinden's character was based on the true-life exploits of Sub-Lieutenant Robert Aitken, who died a few weeks after Sinden. In his first autobiography, A Touch of the Memoirs, Sinden said \\"I had to re-enact a deed originally performed by Commander Donald Cameron. While his X Craft was being towed across the North Sea, the cable picked up a floating mine which then moved along the cable and made straight for his midget. Cameron rushed forward and, lowering himself over the prow of his craft, managed gingerly to push the mine clear with his feet. Donald was our advisor on the film and told me modestly, \\"I couldn't think of anything else to do.\\" He was awarded the VC. I wasn't because we used a dummy. But Donald could swim!\\"A Touch of the Memoirs by Donald Sinden. Hodder & Stoughton Publ. (1982), pp. 209‚Äì10 The cast also included Anthony Wager, who had played a young Pip in Great Expectations (1946). John Mills, who played the older Pip, appeared opposite him.  Reception  =Box office= Above Us the Waves was the sixth most popular film at the British box office that year, after The Dam Busters, White Christmas, Doctor at Sea, The Colditz Story and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. It helped John Mills to be voted the fifth most popular star in the country.'Dirk Bogarde favourite film actor', The Irish Times [Dublin, Ireland] 29 December 1955: 9. According to the National Film Finance Corporation, the film made a comfortable profit.

Belgium had been invaded in August 1914 by German troops, and the eastern city of Li√®ge, except for the strengthened belt of Li√®ge, was taken following this.

It overlooks the eastern shore of Lake Como from hilly slopes starting at more than . Blevio borders the following municipalities: Brunate, Cernobbio, Como, Moltrasio, Torno.  History  The comune of Blevio includes seven villages, the so-called \\"the seven cities\\" (Capovico, Cazzanore, Girola, Maggianico, Mezzovico, Sopravilla, Sorto), the most important of which was Capovico, the closest one to Lake Como. The municipal territory extends from above sea level. The etymology of the name of the city could be found in the Celtic Ligurian \\"Biuelius\\" (Latin \\"vivo ‚Äì alive\\", Welsh \\"byw\\", old Irish \\"biu ‚Äì I use to be\\" and Anglo-Saxon \\"beo ‚Äì I am, I become\\", Indo-Germanic \\"bheou\\"). In 1497 the ruler of Milan Ludovico Sforza gave the fief of Blevio, together with some other near villages, to his lover Ludovica Crivelli. In the following centuries, Blevio became closely linked to Como and finally became a fief of the Tanzi patrician family, whose wealth was based on the silk industry. Count Antonio von Tanzi Blevio, who had been ennobled by the Habsburgs due to his banking activity, built a large villa on the rocks of Perlasca, now part of the neighbouring town of Torno. In 1798, the villa and the village became a possession of the Taverna and Borromeo families, two of the most affluent families of the Milanese aristocracy, before being created as a free town after the Napoleonic invasion of Italy. A minor branch of the same family, who received the title of Edler von Tanzi by the Habsburgs, continued to keep vast possessions of lands in Blevio and nearby Torno until early 1900. Blevio joined the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1859 and later the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, following the conquest of the Piedmontese army of Lombardy. Its numerous lakefront villas host a number of Italian and international celebrities, including singers, actors and athletes.

The site is moorland forming part of the Bewick and Beanley Moors SSSI, although prior to the Bronze Age it is likely to have been thickly forested with broadleaf deciduous trees. This site is most famous for the cup and ring mark art present on the outcrop. Place-name meaning Hunterheugh derives from Old English huntor \\"hunter\\" and hoh \\"hill-spur\\".  Rock art  The first phase of the carvings is all on the natural rock surface and these are now very heavily weathered. The motifs incorporate undulations of the surface into their design so that most are connected to each other by artificial grooves or by a natural rock slope which allows water to flow from one design to the next. This phase is believed to be Neolithic, and probably early Neolithic at that. This is supported by the discovery of what appears to be a broken sandstone axehead 1.2 m from the carved rock outcrop at the base of the topsoil. Such ground and polished axeheads are known from elsewhere in Northumberland. Phase 1 of the carvings was broken through when the rock dome was quarried at a later date. New carvings were then made on the surfaces exposed by quarrying. These show no attempt to take undulations and variations in the rock (with one exception), none of the designs are inter-connected, and the shapes are more varied and more crudely executed. This phase is believed to be Early Bronze Age in date and appears to imitate the earlier tradition, but does not share the same sense of positioning.

Cabiate borders the following municipalities: Lentate sul Seveso, Mariano Comense, Meda, Seregno Physical geography Cabiate is far: *16 km from Monza *21 km from Como *28 km from Milan *35 km from Lecco *40 km from Varese History The name of the town comes from the word claveato. The final ending in -ate underlines a probable Lombard foundation. First historical reference about the origin of the town comes from 745, when a document identifies it with the name Vico Capiete. The town grew around a castle. The original position of the town was beside Ter√≤ creek, the small river which flows in the center of Cabiate. The history of Cabiate is linked to the nearby Meda and to the Brianza. Before 1024 a huge number of Cabiatesi depended on the monastery San Vittore in Meda (which was part of the Pieve di Mariano Comense), which at any rate, thanks to the abbess Allegrezza, gave the power to Giacomo da Rho, founder of the family da Rho, who would have built a residence in Cabiate. In the subsequent years, the history of this area was linked to Milan, and, from 1535, to the Spanish Empire. The town was turned to the Marliani family, then, in 1538, to the Giussani, then the Taverna, coming back to the Marliani and then in 1643 to Inverigo's Crivelli. Three centuries later, the Duchy of Milan finally passed to the Austrians who replaced a wood bridge over Ter√≤ with one of masonry. During the World War II the Germans passed through Cabiate during their retreat to Como. After April 25, 1945 three people were killed having been accused of being fascists.

Active since 1990 in the country music field, she has released a total of seven studio albums and has charted more than twenty singles on the country music charts in her native Canada. Several of these singles have also crossed over to the American country music charts, although she has not entered the Top 40 in the U.S.; her highest charting songs, \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\" and \\"Take That\\", both peaked at No. 52 in 1994. Her highest chart single is the No. 8 \\"Better Off Broken\\" from 1999 in Canada. Career =Early life= Lisa Brokop was born in Surrey, British Columbia in 1973. By age seven, Brokop was performing on stage with her accordion-playing mother, performing polkas and numerous country music songs. When Brokop was twelve years old, she began sitting in with bands throughout Vancouver, British Columbia and joined a touring band in when she was 15. In 1990, when Brokop was only 17 years old, she issued her debut single, \\"Daddy, Sing to Me\\". The song managed to reach the top 10 of the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. Her debut album, My Love, was issued the following year on the independent Libre Records label. In June 1991, Brokop graduated from the Princess Margaret Secondary School in her hometown of Surrey;Princess Margaret Secondary 1990-1991 Student class album, page 88 she then proceeded to move south to Nashville, Tennessee to further her country music career. =1994‚Äì1999: Breakthrough success= A costume Lisa Brokop wore for the 1993 movie 'Harmony Cats' (Surrey Museum) In 1992, Brokop began performing in local clubs and caught the attention of The Nashville Network. The network began to play Brokop's video for her single \\"Time to Come Back Home\\" and had her as a guest on The Ralph Emery Show. The appearance on The Ralph Emery Show and a 30-minute showcase at a local club got Brokop a record deal with Patriot Records, a label owned by Liberty Records. Before Brokop began recording her second album, she starred in the 1994 film Harmony Cats, where she played a country singer who leaves home in search of a big break in Nashville. Brokop contributed to the movie's soundtrack and her cover of Tammy Wynette's 1968 number one hit \\"Stand by Your Man\\" was issued as a single, peaking at No. 88 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. The first single of Brokop's second album, \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\", was issued in June 1994. The single cracked the top 20 in Canada, but only reached No. 52 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Nevertheless, her first major label album, Every Little Girl's Dream, was released in September 1994. While \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\" was charting, many Canadian radio stations refused to play Brokop's music after the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ruled that \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\" did not have a sufficient amount of Canadian content in the song. Nevertheless, Brokop's album went on to produce two more top 40 singles in Canada with \\"Take That\\" and \\"One of Those Nights\\". By 1995, the album had been certified Gold by the CRIA, for sales of 50,000 copies. Also in 1995, Brokop, along with fellow singers Victoria Shaw and Chely Wright, received a nomination for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music awards, but lost to Chely Wright. Lisa Brokop in June 1999 In 1995, Patriot Records had been shut down and Brokop was transferred to Capitol Nashville and issued her third album, Lisa Brokop, the following year. None of the album's first two singles reached the top 40 in Canada or the United States and the album's third, \\"West of Crazy\\", did not chart at all. The failure of the album left Brokop burned out and she then ended her relationship with Capitol to take time off to focus on songwriting. In 1998, Brokop signed with the Nashville division of Columbia Records, where she released the single \\"How Do I Let Go\\". The song reached the top 20 of the RPM Country Tracks chart and received a nomination for SOCAN Song of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Association awards that year. Her album, When You Get to Be You, was released in July 1998 in Canada and produced five more singles including the No. 21-peaking \\"What's Not to Love\\" and \\"Better Off Broken\\", the latter becoming Brokop's highest charting single, peaking at No. 8 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart in 1999. The album was scheduled for release in the United States in 1998, but was not released due to the poor performance of the album's four American singles and Brokop departed Columbia by the end of 1999. =2000 ‚Äì present: Continued success= In 2000, Brokop ventured on her own and launched the Cosmo Records label where she released her fifth album, Undeniable. The album's first single, \\"Something Undeniable\\", had reached No. 18 on the country charts in Canada when RPM had been shut down. In 2001, Brokop received two Canadian Country Music Association awards for Independent Song of the Year for \\"Something Undeniable\\" and Independent Female Artist of the Year. The album's third single, \\"I'd Like to See You Try\\", won Brokop Independent Song of the Year again in 2002. She also was awarded Independent Female Artist of the Year again in 2002 and 2003. In 2004, in an attempt to have success in the United States, Brokop signed with Asylum-Curb and issued her first single for the label, \\"Wildflower\\". The song failed to chart in the United States. An album, Hey, Do You Know Me, followed in January 2005 in Canada. The album was never released in the United States due to the failure of the first single. Shortly before departing Asylum-Curb in 2005, Brokop released the single \\"Big Picture\\" in Canada and the United States; it was never included on any album. After a three-year hiatus, Brokop went back in the studio to record her seventh album, Beautiful Tragedy. The album was released in August 2008 on the independent Ellbea Records label and featured the hit \\"Break It\\". Eleven of the album's twelve tracks were co-written by Brokop and all tracks were produced by Brokop and her husband, country singer Paul Jefferson. Brokop and husband Paul Jefferson have begun performing as The Jeffersons and released their debut album as a duo in 2011. The album has since released three singles in Canada: \\"Find the Sun,\\" \\"Crazy On Me\\" and a country cover of The Wallflowers' 1996 song, \\"One Headlight\\". In July 2013, Brokop signed a new deal with RareSpark media group to begin working on a new solo album. A new single, \\"Let It Burn\\" was released to Canadian Country radio on September 23.

The Grand Ruler of Negeri Sembilan is elected by a council of ruling chiefs in the state, or the Undangs. This royal practice has been followed since 1773. The Yamtuan Besar is elected from among the four leading princes of Negeri Sembilan (Putera Yang Empat). This unique form of government later inspired the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to implement a form of rotational constitutional monarchy for a newly independent Federation of Malaya(now Malaysia). Thus, the office of Yang di-Pertuan Agong was created. History Tuanku Muhammad Shah (seated in the middle) with his personal attendants, 1897. Negeri Sembilan has been receiving immigrants from Sumatra for hundreds of years. Prior to the implementation of this unique form of monarchy, the area was ruled by the Sultan of Malacca. After Malacca was defeated by the Portuguese, it was ruled by the Sultanate of Johor. By 1760, however, Johor which was having trouble from the Dutch, decided to allow the state to find a leader from Minangkabau in Sumatra. Between 1760 and 1770, a council of leaders known as the penghulu luak (the predecessor of the Undangs today) left for Pagar Ruyung in Minangkabau in search of a leader. The Raja of Pagar Ruyung‚Äîwho was believed to be a descendant of Dhul-Qarnayn (possibly Alexander the Great or Cyrus the Great ), gave them a leader in the form of his son, Raja Mahmud. Raja Mahmud later became known as Raja Melewar when he came to Negeri Sembilan. When Raja Melewar died in 1795, instead of selecting his son as their new leader, the same council of leaders once again set out on a journey to their ancestral land. This time, the Raja of Pagar Ruyong gave another one of his sons‚ÄîRaja Hitam as their new Yamtuan Besar. Raja Hitam married Raja Melewar's daughter, Tengku Aishah, but they had no children. He died in 1808. Once again, the leaders of Negri Sembilan went to Minangkabau in search of someone to replace their leader. The Raja of Pagar Ruyung at that time sent his son, Raja Lenggang. He wedded Raja Hitam's second daughter, Tengku Ngah, from another marriage. They had two sons: Tengku Radin and Tengku Imam. This time, the Undangs did not embark on a trip to meet the Raja of Pagar Ruyong. Thus, for the first time in its history, Negri Sembilan had a hereditary leader. Yam Tuan Radin ruled for 30 years before he died. Then, his brother, Yang di-Pertuan Imam, ruled for eight years. When Yamtuan Imam, Yamtuan Sri Menanti died in 1869, there was a power struggle among the prince to ascend the throne. Yamtuan Imam left a son, Tunku Ahmad Tunggal who should have inherited the throne. Dato 'Siamang Gagap instead elevated Tuanku Ampuan Intan as a temporary Regent (1869-1872) on the grounds that a temporary successor to Yam Tuan Imam can be decided. As a result, in 1874, fierce warfare between Yamtuan Antah and Tunku Ahmad Tunggal erupted. This war was known as 'Bukit Putus War'. Yamtuan Antah was defeated by Tunku Ahmad Tunggal, and fled to Johor and seek Sultan of Johor assistance to tell the British to help him. At the urging of the Sultan of Johor, the Governor of the Straits Settlements agreed to reconcile the dispute between Yamtuan Antah with Tunku Ahmad Tunggal and Dato 'Kelana Sungai Ujong. In 1876, witnessed by the British Governor of the Straits Settlements, this agreement was signed by the rulers of Luak Johol, Inas, Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi and Gunung Pasir. Through this agreement they acknowledge and ratify Yamtuan Antah as Yamtuan Sri Menanti. Yamtuan Antah's son, Tuanku Muhammad, later took over until his death in 1933. Tuanku Muhammad's son, Tuanku Abdul Rahman, took over in 1933. Tuanku Abdul Rahman later became the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaya in 1957 (during which time his brother Tunku Laksamana Nasir was regent). Tuanku Abdul Rahman's son, Tuanku Munawir, ascended the throne in 1960 and ruled until 1967. When Tuanku Munawir died, his brother, Tuanku Ja'afar Tuanku Abdul Rahman, became the ruler of Negri Sembilan, by-passing Munawir's son Muhriz of Negeri Sembilan, who at 19 years of age was a minor. Tuanku Jaafar also served as the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. During this period, Negeri Sembilan was ruled by the regent, Y.A.M. Tunku Laxamana Tunku Naquiyuddin. However, on the death of Tuanku Jaafar in 2008, the Undangs elected Tuanku Muhriz (eldest son of Tuanku Munawir and nephew of Tuanku Jaafar).

In 1981 he returned to Yale, and he received his Master of Science and Master of Philosophy degrees in Computer Science in 1982 and 1984. After several years in a startup company, he enrolled at Harvard University, where he was earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1989. Career and research Before joining Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 2011, he was the Director of the Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was also the Horvitz Professor of Computer Science. From 1998‚Äì2005, he was the head of the Bioinformatics department at The Institute for Genomic Research, one of the world's largest genome sequencing centers, and prior to that he was a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University.ccb.jhu.edu Brief biosketchEditorial on evolution and the flu, Philadelphia Inquirer In 2013, Salzberg won the Benjamin Franklin award in bioinformatics. In 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, Salzberg was selected for inclusion in HighlyCited.com, a ranking compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information of scientists who are among the top 1% most cited for their subject field during the previous ten years. He was also chosen for this list when it was first created in 2001. In March 2015, he was named a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University for his accomplishments as an interdisciplinary researcher and excellence in teaching the next generation of scholars. The Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships were established in 2013 by a gift from Michael Bloomberg. Salzberg holds joint appointments in the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Salzberg has been a prominent scientist in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology since the 1990s. He has made many contributions to gene finding algorithms, notably the GLIMMER program for bacterial gene finding as well as several related programs for finding genes in animals, plants, and other organisms. He has also been a leader in genome assembly research and is one of the initiators of the open source AMOS project. He was a participant in the human genome project as well as many other genome projects, including the malaria genome (Plasmodium falciparum) and the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In 2001‚Äì2002, he and his colleagues sequenced the anthrax that was used in the 2001 anthrax attacks. They published their results in the journal Science in 2002. These findings helped the FBI track the source of the attacks to a single vial at Ft. Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. Salzberg together with David Lipman started the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project in 2003, a project to sequence and make available the genomes of thousands of influenza virus isolates. Soon after the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the mid-2000s, Salzberg's research lab and his collaborators developed a suite of highly efficient, accurate programs for alignment of NGS sequences to large genomes and for assembly of sequences from RNA-Seq experiments. These include the \\"Tuxedo\\" suite, comprising the Bowtie, TopHat, and Cufflinks programs, which have been cited tens of thousands of times in the years since their publication. Salzberg has also been a vocal advocate against pseudoscience and in favor of the teaching of evolution in schools, and has authored editorials and appeared in print media on this topic. He writes a widely read column at Forbes magazineSalzberg's column at Forbes on science, medicine, and pseudoscience. His work at Forbes won the 2012 Robert P. Balles Prize in Critical Thinking.. In 2018, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers include Cole Trapnell, Ben Langmead, and Olga Troyanskaya.

Early life Stone was born in Guilford, Connecticut to Stephen Stone and Rebecca Bishop. When he was two, his family moved to the growing town of Litchfield, Connecticut. Although the son of a prosperous farmer, Stone ventured off on his own as a merchant. Stone married his first wife, Leah Moore, in 1780. They had two children together. Stone married his second wife, Abigail Dayton, in 1799. Stone died peacefully in 1833 at the age of 84. United Empire Loyalist Stone was a Loyalist Combatant operating out of New York City and Long Island during the Revolutionary war. With the outbreak of the American Revolution, Stone chose to remain loyal to the King and fought on the British side. He was active in collaborating with Loyalists in Connecticut in escaping to British controlled areas of the colonies, including David Mathews, Mayor of New York City. He was forced to flee to British-controlled New York. He was never able to return to his home because he was wanted for treason, and took up lands in Upper Canada. Founder of Gananoque, Ontario In the 1790s after fleeing the United States on horse back in the night, Stone made his way to Upper Canada where he petitioned the king for a land grant due to his remaining loyal to the crown during the Revolution. He was granted 700 acres of land on the west side of the Gananoque River. He choose this area due to the two waterfalls on the Gananoque River. Here he built a sawmill and a gristmill. This began the settlement that is known today as the town of Gananoque, Ontario. Stone became a successful businessman in Gananoque and also began a ferry service as early as 1801 to move people, animals, and produce across the Gananoque River. He was given many titles and official offices including: roads commissioner, customs collector, colonel of the militia, and justice of the peace. Thanks to Stone's mills on the Gananoque River, many other mills were built and the town thrived as an industrial site by the end of the eighteenth century. It later became a recreational launch point and tourist attraction for the Thousand Islands in modern times. War of 1812 The monument in Joel Stone Park Gananoque of how the town looked during the war of 1812 He defended the town and area again in the War of 1812. Trade was very popular between the United States and Upper Canada, as it was easier for both sides to trade with each other than to get supplies from larger cities. Trade continued after international peace ended in June 1812 until Gananoque was attacked in September 1812. Stone's militia did their best to hold off the attack on Gananoque but the considerable damage was inflicted upon the settlement. Stone was absent at the time of the attack; he was escorting a convoy to Kingston. Stone's wife, who was hiding the valuables in her home, was wounded after being shot in the hip. The War ended in 1814 with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in Belgium. After the War, Stone lived comfortably until his death. Memorials The plaque commemorating Joel Stone in Gananoque Located in the town of Gananoque, near the town hall, is a plaque dedicated to Stone which reads: > Born in Connecticut, Stone forfeited his home and property there when he > fled to New York to serve with the Loyalist militia during the American > Revolution. He came to Canada in 1786, settled with his family in New > Johnstown (now Cornwall) and was eventually granted 700 acres of land on the > west bank of the Gananoque River.

During World War II she worked in Black Propaganda. She was intimate with many members of the artistic bohemian society in which she flourished, including Jacob Epstein, Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon, and was married three times; to the journalist Sefton Delmer, and to the composers Constant Lambert and Alan Rawsthorne. Life Untitled (Migrations) Oil on canvas 1970s Born Isabel Nicholas, the daughter of a master mariner, in the East End of London, she was raised in Liverpool. She studied at the Liverpool College of Art, won a scholarship to the Royal Academy in LondonIsabel Rawsthorne 1912-1992 Paintings, Drawings and Designs, Harrogate, 1997 and spent two years in the studio of the sculptor Jacob Epstein.J. Rose, Demons and Angels: A Life of Jacob Epstein, London, 2002 Rawsthorne's first show was a sell-out and by September 1934 she was living in Paris. She worked with Andr√© Derain and lived and travelled for a time with Balthus and his wife. She was painted several times by Derain and Pablo Picasso. In 1936 she married her first husband, the foreign correspondent for the Daily Express, Sefton Delmer. The travel, parties and luxurious apartment in the Place Vend√¥me, never replaced her Left Bank life, however; and most days she made the long walk there and back. A lifelong Socialist, she visited Spain while Delmer was reporting the Spanish Civil War. Rawsthorne was at the heart of the Paris avant-garde and became involved with Alberto Giacometti.V Wiesinger, Alberto Giacometti, Isabel Nicholas, Correspondences, Paris, 2007 They shared many intellectual enthusiasms and a commitment to a modern form of representational painting. Her characteristically astonished gaze and defiant stance can be seen in the new kind of etiolated figure that Giacometti developed over the next decade.For example The Chariot, text The onset of World War II forced Rawsthorne to leave Paris. She relinquished at least one ticket out and did not flee until the day the Germans arrived on 14 June 1940. She remained with Delmer for the first part of the war, but they eventually divorced. She maintained indirect links with France by working in intelligence and black propaganda for the Political Warfare Executive.S. Delmer, Black Boomerang accessed 26 January 2010 During the Italian Campaign, she edited the magazine Il Mondo Libero. About this time, 1943‚Äì44, she encountered Francis Bacon within the arty set around the BBC, although they probably did not become intimate until a few years later. Rawsthorne's closest wartime friends appear to have been John Rayner (typographer, journalist and soldier (SOE), the photographer Joan Leigh Fermor (then Rayner), the Schiaparelli model, Anna Phillips, and the composer Elizabeth Lutyens, but her social life encompassed many others including the poets Louis MacNeice, Dylan Thomas (with whom she shared working quarters), Ian Fleming and old friends from Paris, Peter Rose-Pulham, Peter Watson (editor of the journal Horizon) and the spy Donald MacleanC Jacobi, ‚ÄòCat's Cradle ‚Äì Francis Bacon and the Art of ‚ÄòIsabel Rawsthorne‚Äô‚Äô, Visual Culture in Britain, Manchester, 2009 Returning to Paris in 1945, Rawsthorne was re- united with Giacometti and lived with him for a short while, but they never married.J Lord, Giacometti: A Biography, London, 1983 She continued to be involved in the evolution of the figurative style associated with Existentialism. She socialised with Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Wahl, etc., and for a time lived a few doors away from the headquarters of the journal Les Temps Modernes. She also entertained the philosopher A J Ayer in Paris, and saw Eduardo Paolozzi and Bacon. There were relationships with Georges Bataille and the composer Ren√© Leibowitz, but in the winter of 1946/7 she withdrew to modest lodgings in the Indre to work alone. The composer Constant Lambert visited her in 1947 and they married later that year. Following her second marriage, her base became London. Her art world associates, including Bacon and Lucian Freud, created a potent mix with a glitzier musical set, such as the Sitwells, Lutyens, Frederick Ashton, Margot Fonteyn, Alan Rawsthorne.D Heyes, 'Rawsthorne and Lambert' (1996), The Friends of Alan Rawsthorne accessed 26/01/10 From 1949, she and Bacon showcased their figurative brand of modern art at the Hanover Gallery and she exhibited in group shows organised by the ICA and the British Council. She began her career as a designer for the Royal Ballet and the opera at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells. Lambert died in 1951 and Rawsthorne returned to Paris to paint. She continued to see Giacometti, but eventually settled with Alan Rawsthorne. They moved to a thatched cottage in rural Essex with a purpose built studio, near friends such as the politician Tom Driberg, poet Randall Swingler, artists Michael Ayrton and Biddy and Roy Noakes; Bacon had a house not far away. Six of Bacon's portraits of Rawsthorne were shown in his 1967 show, including Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne. In all, between 1964 and 1970 he painted 14 images of her, including five triptychs. Giacometti died in 1966 and Rawsthorne in 1992; Bacon outlived Rawsthorne by a few months. Apart from visits to London and Paris, Africa, Greece and Australia, and a short period in Cambridge (1972-3), she lived in the cottage for forty years - half of her life. She raised geese, a nod to her interest in Konrad Lorenz, and became involved in the emergent environmentalist movement. She and her last husband are buried in Thaxted churchyard.Thaxted churchyard. Career Rawsthorne's work was dominated by the body, she painted figures and animals. Her father supplied exotic creatures to British zoos and as a child she took to drawing these and other wildlife. Later she became interested in natural history and new ideas in Anthropology, Ecology and Ethology, such as those of her friends Michel Leiris, Georges Bataille. These inform the skeletal bird, fish and bat figures of her 1949 Hanover Gallery show, the haunting ape series, and her last, large Migration pictures. Rawsthorne's two years with Epstein and their mutual enthusiasm for Rodin developed her ideas about vitalism and movement, but she never became part of British Neo-Romanticism. In Paris she continuing her studies of the nude at the free and easy Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. She associated with Giacometti, Tristan Tzara and the Surrealist circle but was committed to a figurative form of modern art. She called it ‚ÄòQuintessentialism‚ÄôP Rose Pulham, ‚ÄòIsabel Lambert‚Äô Isabel Lambert, London, 1949 She maintained connections to an alternative circle of representational artists: Francis Gruber and Peter Rose-Pulham, as well as Balthus and Derain. Her outlook was anti-idealist, intellectual and, like Giacometti, she saw painting from the real world as a challenge that could never be fully met. During the 1940s Rawsthorne adapted animal, archaic and pre-historic imagery into motifs of birth, sexuality and death. She did not share the fashionable interest in the formal properties of Oceanic or Archaic art. Instead, she investigated the uncanny ‚Äòpresence‚Äô achieved by ancient figures, especially Egyptian sculpture. She also studied this quality in Early Renaissance paintings, and in the evidence of the body itself, X-rays, skeletons, figures and animals she found in the countryside or drew in London Zoo. In the 1950s and '60s her explorations of the embattled origins of art and life were adapted into designs for the ballet and opera, a Minoan Tiresias created for the ballet of the same name premiered in 1951 at Covent Garden, the last work of her husband Constant Lambert. She continued her studies of the body, in motion this time, in the practice rooms of the Royal Ballet. Over the next twenty years she painted images of Fonteyn, Rudolph Nureyev, Antoinette Sibley and other dancers that developed a vivacious new language of movement. In 1961 she worked from the figure and landscape in Nigeria shortly after its Independence, at the Zaria Art School with the artist Clifford Frith (grandson of William Powell Frith). Rawsthorne explored the ambiguities of appearance through the theme of the double ‚Äì reflections, such as those seen in the practice room mirrors, for instance. During the late 1960s and 70s, the deaths of Giacometti and Rawsthorne prompted her to refine these ideas in a set of ethereal double portraits juxtaposing living, dead and sculpted likenesses.For example, Reflected Portrait of Alan These works returned to the mati√®re relief effects of the early 1950s and exchanged ideas with Bacon and the sculptor Roy Noakes. Some of these new works and a selection of her innovative dancers were presented to the public at the Marlborough Gallery in 1968.Isabel Lambert, Marlborough Gallery, London, 1968 From the 1950s onwards she developed a series of paintings based on the Essex countryside. Existential rather than pastoral, they responded to environmentalist publications such as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. The last of these, Migrations, embed bird and animal motifs in timeless settings. The extraordinary brushwork and relief effects developed over a life-time of drawing in close association with sculptors, was combined with a new potency of colour and epic scale. Swathes of yellow evoke the deserts of pre-history and post-history, as well as the very immediate issue of the fields of oil seed rape that were appearing in the 1970s. In later life, widely read biographies of Giacometti and Bacon brought Rawsthorne fame as a model and muse,Lord, Giacometti: A Biography; D Farson, The Gilded Gutter Life of Bacon, London,1993 but unfortunately had the effect of obscuring her main profession. By the 1980s she was better known as a once beautiful siren, or the bon viveur that Bacon partied with and painted as ‚ÄòIsabel Rawsthorne‚Äô.The Estate of Francis Bacon accessed 26/01/10 Since her death, however, serious scholarship has ensued and several paintings have entered public collections.

First explored by Ronald Simison, a farmer, when digging flagstones in 1958, he conducted his own excavations at the site in 1976. Alerted by Simison, archaeologist John Hedges then mounted a full study, prepared a technical report and wrote a popular book that cemented the tomb's name. 16,000 human bones were found at the site, as well as 725 from birds. These were identified as predominantly belonging to the white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and represented between 8 and 20 individuals. These were originally interpreted as a foundation deposit; however, this interpretation has been challenged by new dating techniques. These reveal that the eagles died c. 2450‚Äì2050 BCE, up to 1,000 years after the building of the tomb. This confirms growing evidence from other sites that the neolithic tombs of Orkney remained in use for many generations. Access the tomb is via a low tunnel long. Visitors can lie flat on a wheeled trolley, and then stand up in the interior of the tomb. In January 2017 the tomb was featured in the BBC Two archaeology series Britain's Ancient Capital: Secrets of Orkney.

A non-removable media variant family of 12, 24 and 48 MB capacity, the MMD, was then announced in 1976. This family's interface, SMD, derived from the earlier Digital RP0x interface, was documented as ANSI Standard X3.91M - 1982, Storage Module Interfaces with Extensions for Enhanced Storage Module Interfaces. The SMD interface is based upon a definition of two flat interface cables (\\"A\\" control and \\"B\\" data) which run from the disk drive to a controller and then to a computer. This interface allows data to be transferred at 9.6 Mbit/s. The SMD interface was supported by many 8 inch and 14 inch removable and non-removable disk drives. It was mainly implemented on disk drives used with mainframes and minicomputers and was later itself replaced by SCSI. Control Data shipped its 100,000th SMD drive in July 1981.Magnetic Peripherals Corp. Magazine, August 10, 1981 By 1983 at least 25 manufacturers had supplied SMD drives,1984 Disk/Trend Report including, Ampex, Century Data Systems, CDC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Micropolis, Pertec, Priam, NEC and Toshiba. CDC 976x disk geometry The CDC 9762 80 MB variant has 5 √ó 14\\" platters. The top and bottom platters are guard platters and not used for storage. The top and bottom guard platters are exactly the same size as the data platters, and are usually made from a data platter which had too many errors to be usable as a data platter. The remaining 3 platters give 5 data surfaces and one servo surface for head positioning, being the upper surface of the center platter. The CDC 9766 300 MB variant has 12 √ó 14\\" platters. Again the top and bottom platters are guard platters and not used for storage. The remaining 10 platters give 19 data surfaces and one servo surface for head positioning, again being the upper surface of the center platter. Common to both the 80 MB and 300 MB disks, they have 823 cylinders and the servo surface is on one of the central platters. The sector size and sectors per track depend on how the disk is initialized. 34 sectors of 512 data bytes each per track is the configuration used on the GEC 4000 series minicomputers. SMD disk packs (as the Storage Module itself was most commonly called) required head alignment to assure interchangeability of media between drives.

His style can be described as pure simplicity and functional architecture. Ibler was born in Zagreb. He gained his diploma in architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden, Germany. In 1921, he joined the group around Le Corbusier and L'Esprit Nouveau in Paris. He then studied from 1922-24 at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Berlin, in the studio of German architect Hans Poelzig which influenced his work during 1920s. His first significant project, the District Labour Insurance Building in Zagreb (1923), was the first project to reflect the spirit of the modern architectural movement in Yugoslavia. Between 1925 and 1935, he established the so-called \\"Zagreb school of architecture\\" with fellow architects Drago Galiƒá, Mladen Kauzlariƒá, Stjepan Planiƒá and others. Drago Ibler was a strong supporter of the social ideals of modern architecture as well as the aesthetics, and founded the Earth Group (), with a group of left-oriented progressive artists. He was also a member of CIAM. Ibler's ten-story building in Zagreb, built in 1958, colloquially referred to as the \\"Wooden Skyscraper\\" () In the 1920s and 1930s, Ibler worked on numerous architectural competitions, but with poor results due to the conservative environment and resistance to his progressive ideas. In this time he designed villas on the island of Korƒçula and in Zagreb, several industrial buildings, the District Labour Insurance Building in Mostar (built in 1930, today an ambulatory care facility), this building has a convex half-ring-shaped entrance with a porch, and a dynamical balance of the low office building and the tall volume of the residential part and stairways. After that, he designed the District Labour Insurance Building in Skopje (1932), which was important for Yugoslav architecture because it introduced Le Corbusier's principles, including ribbon windows. In 1926, Drago Ibler became a professor at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts, where he taught architecture until 1941. After that, he relocated to Switzerland and joined the University of Geneva as a lecturer in architecture. After the World War II, in 1950, he returned to Zagreb, and led a Master Studio in architecture, returning to teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts. He ceased to be a rigid functionalist and encouraged the humanization of architecture by means of more decorative, sculptural and harmonious compositions. An example of this are his designs for the New Opera House in Belgrade (1948; unrealized). He made excellent designs for the New Yugoslav Embassy in Moscow (1959; unrealized), and New Tito's Residence in Zagreb (1961- 4; unrealized). Before his death, he designed several residential blocks in the centre of Zagreb, which are characterized by simplicity and functional planning, in Martiƒáeva, Smiƒçiklasova and Vla≈°ka Streets. Ibler died, aged 70, in an automobile accident near Novo Mesto, Slovenia.

S. Chakravarthy. The film features Ajith Kumar in dual roles with Meena, Vasundhara Das and Nagma playing the supporting roles. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Deva, and cinematography was handled by Ravi K. Chandran. The film was released theatrically on 8 June 2001. Plot Abdullah runs a motorcycle workshop with a few workers. He also gives casual legal advice to the locals. A computer science student named Indhu develops a crush on him and tries woo him, although Abdullah has nothing of it. In a massive street protest by lawyers across the city, Abdullah, in altered appearance, kidnaps Judge Vedhachalam, after introducing himself as ‚ÄòCitizen‚Äô. Later on, Abdullah proceeds to kidnap Collector Santhanam by posing as freedom fighter Sundaramoorthy. In both kidnaps, Abdullah mentions ‚ÄòAttipatti‚Äô, which seemed to render his victims speechless. With these two high-profile kidnappings, the case is handed over to CBI, led by Senior Officer Sarojini Harichandran. Sarojini finds out that both kidnap victims worked together in Mayavaram division some years ago, and was involved in a riot that happened in Attipatti. However, a check with Mailadhurai sub-collector‚Äôs office and Nagapattinam collector‚Äôs office found that there is no town or village in the area named Attipatti. She then visits the main collector‚Äôs office in Tanjavur and is shocked to find out that the village Attipatti existed in records before 1973, but not in the years after that. She becomes certain that the kidnapper too has a link to Attipatti. Meanwhile, Abdullah becomes irritated with Indhu who keeps longing for his affection. He scolds her and says that she doesn‚Äôt know who he really is and the pain he endures in his heart. Through an information given by the Tanjavur office, the CBI team track down a former employee of the local government which Attipatti was under. He tells them to visit Lutheran Chapel‚Äôs Father Louis who knew every single person of Attipatti. In a visit to the Lutheran Chapel, Sarojini and her team meet Father Kuriakose who inform them that Father Louis had passed away 10 years ago, but left a box to be handed over to whichever government body that come to the church and ask about Attipatti. After reading the letter in the box, Sarojini instructs digging near the coastal area where Attipatti once located. She and her team is horrified to find hundreds of dead bodies buried deep under. They are presumably the former inhabitants of Attipatti. Buried with them is also a tombstone bearing the names of all who perished. After a quick verification with the last census, they found out one name is missing in the tombstone, a five year-old named Arivanandam. Father Kuriakose informs Sarojini based on church records, a boy named Anthony was baptised on the same year the atrocity happened, and that he eventually went on to obtain Law degree. Sarojini concludes that Arivanandam and Anthony are the same person and he is Citizen, and her further investigation leads her to Abdullah. With the CBI officers prepare to ambush Abdullah in a mosque, he manages to escape via a secret route. Sarojini discovers Citizen‚Äôs secret operation room within the mosque. There she finds out Citizen‚Äôs next target is DGP Devasagayam. However, at the same moment, Citizen had already kidnapped the DGP. The CBI officers receive information that Citizen is hiding in Tada forest and go after him. In the forest, Indhu comes to meet Abdullah and reveals she already knew he was Citizen some time ago and that she still likes him in spite of that. CBI officers arrive at the forest and after some chase, finally manage to arrest Citizen. In the trial, a flashback scene appears where Citizen tells the court what happened in his village, Attipatti. It was a hamlet of some 700 inhabitants surrounded by the sea. Therefore, it is often flooded by the rise in water levels, causing deaths. The area‚Äôs MLA had promised to built a wall in exchange for votes. However it was never built. When the villagers, led by Citizen‚Äôs father, Subramani, go the collector‚Äôs office to ask about its status, the collector turned them away saying a wall cannot be built in that area as the number of people is too small. The villagers later found out that the Collector, together with the MLA, the DGP and the Judge had taken for themselves some 150 million rupees allocated by the government to build the wall. After that, when the four of them visited Attipatti, the outraged villagers embarrassed them by forcing them to eat moldy rice and pouring water on them. In response, the four officials vowed to make Attipatti disappear from the map. One night, they arrived at Attipatti with some men, caught all the villagers, tied them on a boat, tortured them and pushed them to the sea, killing all except Arivanandam. As the scene switches back to the trial, Citizen explains he didn‚Äôt kidnap the MLA because he had already been punished after losing in the election. With the judge, DGP and collector in the witness stand, Citizen tells the court death penalty or life in prison is too soft a punishment for them. He says corruption exists because government officers want to provide a luxurious life for their family members. He suggests to strip the wealth and citizenship of the three and all their immediate and extended family members. The film ends with the court releasing Citizen on the grounds that he fought for the good of the country.

Ajith Kumar put on weight for the film, which would feature him in nine roles, and he claimed that he was inspired by Kamal Haasan's award- winning performances. Sameera Reddy was originally a part of the cast but opted out due to conflicting commitments.https://web.archive.org/web/20010125023900/http://tamilmovies.com/cgi- bin/news/viewnews.cgi?id=973280062 Subsequently, singer Vasundhara Das, who had earlier appeared in Hey Ram, was chosen to play the leading lady, while Nagma was selected to essay the role of a police officer. A special feature on the making of the film was broadcast by Sun TV in May 2001. Gemini Ganesan was also initially meant to play a role in the film, but his character was later altered in the script and replaced by Pandiyan.http://www.rediff.com/movies/2000/jul/21spice.htm After months of pre-production, shooting started on 28 December 2000 with Ajith and Vasundhara Das, with Ravi K. Chandran as cinematographer who had replaced P. C. Sriram in the project. The location for the Athipatty scenes was an island situated on the outskirts of Chennai, and it took three hours for the team to travel from the city and then by boat to get there. A scene filmed at Rajaji Hall featured five thousand of Ajith's fans as extras. A song in the film was shot in Australia in mid 2000, delaying the proposed release date of 1 May. Release Upon release Citizen received positive reviews from critics and was successful and completed 100-day run at the box office, justifying a relatively large budget of 8 crore. The review from The Hindu labelled it as a \\"definite milestone in Ajit's acting career\\", but criticised the synchronisation between the dubbing artiste, Anuradha, and Nagma. The film was later dubbed and released as Citizen in Telugu, to mixed reviews. The actor and director began to work on another project titled Itihasam, written by Sujatha and focusing on caste issues, but the production was shelved. Soundtrack The music was composed by Deva. All Lyrics were penned by Vairamuthu. The song I like you is derived from I Feel Lonely by German singer Sasha. The song, \\"Australia Desam\\" is not featured in the movie.

It was directed by Jean Negulesco and produced by Samuel G. Engel from a screenplay by Ivan Moffat and Dwight Taylor, based on the novel of the same name by David Divine. The film was Sophia Loren's English-language debut.NY Times She starred opposite Alan Ladd and Clifton Webb, with Alexis Minotis and Laurence Naismith in support. Hugo Friedhofer's score was nominated for a Best Music Academy Award in 1958. Cinematography was by Milton Krasner. It was the first Hollywood movie shot in Greece. Plot Phaedra (Sophia Loren) is a poor Greek sponge diver on the island of Hydra. She works from the boat of her boyfriend, Rhif (Jorge Mistral), an immigrant from Albania. She accidentally finds an ancient Greek statue of a boy riding a dolphin on the bottom of the Aegean Sea. The statue brings pride to the city of Hydra and has been lost for around 2000 years. Her efforts to sell it to the highest bidder lead her to two competing individuals: Dr. James Calder (Alan Ladd), an honest archaeologist who will surrender it to Greek authorities, and Victor Parmalee (Clifton Webb), an aesthete and an unscrupulous dealer in historic artifacts. Calder and Parmalee each try to win Phaedra's cooperation. She works in concert with Parmalee, while developing feelings for Calder. When she seems to waver, Rhif decides to make the deal with Parmalee work. The film reaches a happy conclusion, with virtue rewarded, the statue celebrated by the people of Hydra, and Phaedra and Calder in each other's arms.

You say \\"he's only a statue, and what can a statue achieve?\\" And yet, while I'm gazing at you, My heart tells my head to believe. If the boy whom the gods have enchanted Should arise from the sea, And the wish of my heart could be granted, I would wish that you loved only me.

It was started around 2000 to update HURDAT, the official hurricane database for the Atlantic Basin, which has become outdated since its creation due to various systematic errors introduced into the database over time. This effort has involved reanalyses of ship observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as well as reanalyses done by other researchers over the years. It has been ongoing as of 2016, and should last another four years. Inaccuracies and omissions in existing data Arrows point to storms with unlikely wind/pressure relationships in HURDAT =Errors= HURDAT contains a number of errors which need to be corrected, such demonstrated by the outliers in the a pressure vs. wind speed graph of datapoints in the database (right). Some of these errors have existed since the database's creation during NASA's Apollo Program, where it was used to help produce probabilities of tropical cyclone-induced winds in critical areas such as Cape Kennedy (now Cape Canaveral). =New information= A significant amount of new data for systems between 1851 and 1886 became available after a major basin-wide reanalysis in 1996, a project led by Jose Fernandez-Paratagas with the collaboration of Henry Diaz. The new data was constructed using old newspaper articles and the hemispheric weather map series. Hurricane histories for individual states had been constructed by the 1990s as well, which proposed new storms and increased the knowledge of tropical cyclones already in the database. Due to this profusion of relevant information not included in HURDAT, and evolving definitions for tropical and subtropical cyclones over the decades, the project was started around 2000 to update the official database. Since then, the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set has been utilized to check for older ship reports which were either not utilized nor available to previous researchers. =Incompleteness of dataset= As early as 1957, it was recognized that an increasing trend in the number of tropical cyclones each season in the Atlantic Basin was at least partially tied to increasing observations and better records.Daily Gleaner. Bad News for 'Hurricane Hunters'. Retrieved on 2008-06-06. By analyzing the density of ship tracks over time, it has been estimated that between 1900 and 1966, an average of two storms per year are missing from HURDAT. This is mainly due to a lack of satellite imagery and lack of reconnaissance aircraft prior to 1943. An additional storm per year is likely missing prior to the advent of new technologies. These technologies include satellite-derived Quikscat winds, satellite-derived temperature profile information, and Robert Hart's cyclone phase space diagrams, which have led to a recent increase in tropical cyclone detection. Quikscat was launched in 1999, and has been credited with allowing Chantal to be named during the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.Eric Berger. Decisions to name storms draw concern. Retrieved on 2008-04-05. The last two help determine whether or not a low pressure area is an extratropical cyclone, subtropical cyclone, or tropical cyclone.Chris Landsea. Counting Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Back to 1900. Retrieved on 2008-04-05.

The IPCC report from 2007 noted on older datasets, \\"The historical record typically records the central pressure and the maximum winds, but these turn out not to be physically consistent in older records, mainly prior to about the early 1970s. However, attempts at mutual adjustments result in increases in some years and decreases in others, with little effect on overall trends.\\" However, scientist also point out that many storms remain under reported, especially those not making landfall, or staying in the open ocean. The emerging studies of geological proxies in Paleotempestology however can help to bring more trends to light, by for instance assessing sediments proxies from storm surge. Progress Hurricane Andrew over South Florida as a Category 5 hurricane The project ranks the year 1914 as the quietest hurricane season ever for the Atlantic basin with just one tropical storm. The project has currently reanalyzed storms from the period 1886 to 1965, and has extended HURDAT back to 1851. In 2001, data for the years 1851-1885 were added to the official database from the Fern√°ndez-Partag√°s series of publications. Also, a paleotempestology conference was held at the University of South Carolina which proposed to increase the scope of HURDAT from a starting year of 1851 to a start of 1800. The conference also discussed ways of exchanging information for the inclusion of older tropical cyclones, such as via compact disc or a wikipedia-style website. While the reanalysis has mostly proceeded sequentially, notable exceptions have been made for the reanalysis of some significant tropical cyclones. In 2002, for the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, the reanalysis was completed for the hurricane, which upgraded the cyclone to a Category 5 hurricane. In 2014, a similar reanalysis was completed for Hurricane Camille. Work by Michael Chenoweth, in collaboration with Cary Mock, increased knowledge of tropical cyclones in the Caribbean Sea for 1750 to 1786. Chenoweth conducted a basin-wide reassessment for old source material from the 1700 to 1855 period by using surface weather observations mainly in the form of ship reports, newspapers, and various diaries and journals from the region around the Caribbean Sea. =Future efforts in other basins= Typhoon Freda, in Joint Typhoon Warning Center database as while Dvorak estimates were There is agreement within tropical cyclone circles of doing an \\"Atlantic-style\\" reanalysis for other ocean basins. Some efforts are underway to start similar reanalyses across the western and eastern north Pacific Ocean, but are likely to take longer to complete. This is due to the need for coordination between the multiple Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres, which have the responsibility for tracking and forecasting tropical cyclones across that ocean. During February 2016, the NHC released the 1959 Mexico hurricane's reanalysis, which was the first system outside the Atlantic basin to be reassessed using methods developed for the Atlantic reanalysis process.

Mander Portman Woodward is a group of British independent schools, with branches in London, Birmingham and Cambridge, offering GCSE and A-Level courses. The college is an alternative to the traditional school setting. Students at MPW do not wear a uniform, are on first-name terms with their teachers and are taught to take responsibility for themselves and their learning, which is thought to establish the skills they will need for university. The colleges are cosmopolitan with around 70% British and 30% international students leading to a diverse mix of cultures and traditions. Originally known as a crammer, MPW is also an option for full courses. The majority of students take two-year A-level courses and the colleges have expanded to provide for them in a more holistic way ‚Äì extensive extra- curricular provision and facilities such as cafeterias and common rooms provide a positive overall student experience and expand from the founders' sole focus on academia. Recent students include Philippa Cadogan, daughter of Viscount Chelsea, heir to the eighth Earl Cadogan, Lily Allen, Edward Davenport Ryan Benn, Tamara Beckwith, Nina de Roy, Petra Ecclestone, Binky Felstead, Spencer Matthews, Jamie Laing and Alice Dellal. The Chairman of the Governors is Nigel Stout. The CEO of the company is Spencer Coles, the former chief operating officer of Regent's University London. History The school was formed in its current structure in 1973 by Robert Woodward,Robert Woodward: co-founded of the tutorial college MPW Rodney Portman and Nicholas Mander with the aim of applying University of Cambridge-style tutorial teaching to school age students. MPW teaches in small groups (fewer than 10 students per class), which means that students get individual attention. Mander Portman Woodward also offers Easter Revision courses for GCSE, AS and A level students from other schools. The London and Birmingham colleges are part of the CIFE group. MPW produce a range of books including 'Getting into...' guideshttp://trotman.co.uk/product-category/university-entry/getting-into- series/, 'How to complete UCAS' and 'A-Z of surviving exams'.MPW Books,Robert Woodward: teacher and entrepreneur The Independent, 15 November 2008 It was announced on 17 July 2012 that the Apollo Group sold MPW to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners Incorporated for ¬£54.8m. MPW contributed less than 1% of Apollo's earnings in 2011. MPW recorded operating profits of ¬£3.93m (2010: ¬£3.06m) in the twelve months ending August 2011 on revenues of ¬£14.1m (2010: ¬£12.6m). Operating margins hit 27.8% in 2011 up from 24.2% in the previous year. It was announced in December 2015 that Levine Leichtman would sell MPW to Kaplan International. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Results and Destinations At each MPW college in 2017 the most commonly achieved (modal) A level grade was A/A* and over a third of examination entries were at this level. This trend has been consistent across the full MPW Group since 2015, in London since 2009 and in Cambridge since 2008. The colleges are also very successful in terms of value-add, which measures the distance travelled by students at A level relative to where they were at GCSE, and in their improvement of retake student grades, as reported by the Timeshttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/retakes-cram-in-an-extra-exam-or- two-t7g3z8f2f and Sunday Times.https://www.mpw.ac.uk/news/london/from-d-to- delight/ 69% of MPW students in 2016 progressed to top tier universities (universities in the Russell Group, 1994 Group or specialist Medical/Veterinary School). Curriculum The majority of students take A level courses. A small cohort each year take GCSE/IGCSE courses. One-year university foundation programmes are available for international students. The AQA Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) is available to students wishing to take this alongside their other studies, usually in year 12. Every new joiner has an admissions meeting preceding entry to formulate a tailored study plan; students have complete flexibility in terms of subject choice, level and course duration. Full A level and GCSE courses are taught over two years, 18 months or an intensive one-year short course. An increasing number of students also join MPW at the end of year 12 either to complete the courses that they have started at their previous schools or to begin a new set of subjects. There are 43 subjects available and no timetable restrictions. Retakes: A level and GCSE retake courses are shorter and begin in either September or January. MPW has considerable expertise across exam boards and can provide retake courses on the following syllabuses: AQA, CIE, Edexcel/Pearson, OCR and WJEC. Students may take any subjects on a combination of different boards but will not be mixed in their classes: it is a fundamental principle at MPW that all students in a given group are studying for the same examination on the same board on the same date. University Preparation MPW students can expect a considerable amount of assistance in applying to university. Personal tutors supervise and critique personal statements. Specialist preparation is available for students applying to Oxford University and Cambridge University and to competitive degree specialisms such as Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine and Law. Tuition for entrance tests such as the UKCAT, BMAT and LNAT is provided as well as interview practice. MPW staff are experts in their field and author a series of 'Getting Into...' bookshttp://trotman.co.uk/product-category/university-entry/getting-into- series/ to guide students through applications for subjects such as Medicine, Engineering and Business and Economics, and for entry to Oxbridge. Examination Practice Regular testing plays a major part in building MPW students confidence and motivation, as well as perfecting examination technique. Revision tests are sat by all students at all levels, ensuring that revision is a continuous and cumulative process throughout the course. Additional timed assignments under supervised examination conditions are sat by students in their final examination year. Pastoral System MPW adopts a personal tutor system. Each student is assigned to a personal tutor (also called a Director of Studies) whose role is to supervise the academic progress, university applications and general welfare of a small group of students. Regular one-to-one meetings are held to discuss test results, progress in class, homework, UCAS applications and reports. Parents are encouraged to communicate with Directors of Studies on a regular basis and informal meetings between parents, students and tutors provide a constructive forum for assessing progress. Co-curricular Extensive extra-curricular provision is available at all three colleges. Sport is very popular; other options include drama, charity fund-raising, student council, Duke of Edinburgh award, model United Nations, debating and organising the college balls. Schools trips are regular. Each MPW college is situated in a prime location in close proximity to amenities such as museums and theatres. In addition, residential trips and trips overseas are organised to supplement learning. Easter Revision Easter Revisionhttps://www.mpw.ac.uk/courses/easter-revision/ courses are taught in London, Birmingham and Cambridge for three weeks in March/April; MPW's status as a revision course provider was described by the Daily Telegraph as \\"quasi- legendary\\".https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/secondaryeducation/11362009/Time- for-a-new-vision-of-revision.html Current students attend the courses, which are also available to external students; over 1600 join the colleges each year for Easter Revision. The courses are designed to prepare students for GCSE, AS and A level examinations the following summer. London The college is located in South Kensington on the historic road of Queen's Gate.

Along with Ivan Me≈°troviƒá and Frano Kr≈°iniƒá he is considered one of the three most important Croatian sculptors of the 20th century. His most notable sculptures include the Peace monument which stands in front of the United Nations building in New York City and the Miner statue in front of the International Labour Organization headquarters in Geneva. Early life Augustinƒçiƒá was born in the small town of Klanjec in the Hrvatsko Zagorje region in northern Croatia, which was at the time part of Austria-Hungary. In 1918 he enrolled at the Arts and Crafts College in Zagreb, where he studied sculpting under professors Rudolf Valdec and Robert Frange≈°. After the college became the Royal Academy of Arts and Crafts in 1922, he studied under the guidance of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá until his graduation in 1924. He then received a scholarship from the French government and continued his studies at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs and √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the guidance of Jean Antoine Injalbert. In 1925 and 1926 Augustinƒçiƒá held his first exhibitions in Paris, before returning to Zagreb and exhibiting in Zagreb in 1926 and then again in 1927 in Lw√≥w and Zagreb. In 1929 he was one of the founding members of the Earth Group (Croatian: Grupa Zemlja) arts collective which brought together prominent left-oriented sculptors, painters and architects, such as Drago Ibler, Krsto Hegedu≈°iƒá, Ivan Tabakoviƒá, Ivan Generaliƒá, and many others. Augustinƒçiƒá took part in several exhibitions organised by the group between 1929 and 1933, when he left the group, two years before it was banned by the authorities in 1935. Rise to prominence In 1930 Augustinƒçiƒá created his first equestrian sculpture for the monument in Ni≈°, after his design won the competition out of the 23 works submitted, with prominent Yugoslav sculptors Risto Stijoviƒá and Sreten Stojanoviƒá coming in second and third. From then on equestrian statues became one the hallmarks of his career, notable examples being the monument to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in Katowice, Poland (commissioned in the 1930s but placed in 1991) and his most notable work, the Peace monument, erected in front of the United Nations building in New York in 1954. In the late 1930s he also created a couple of monuments to King Alexander in Sombor and Skopje (which were later destroyed in World War II), as well as several sculptures of Croatian politician Stjepan Radiƒá. Other notable works from this period include a number of family tomb headstones at the Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb, including Sorrow (1930), Moses (1932) and Icarus (1935). In 1940 he became a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (JAZU) and his works were featured in the 1940 documentary film Croatian Sculptors (German title: Bilhauerkunst in Kroatien) filmed by Oktavijan Miletiƒá. During the war Augustinƒçiƒá remained active and was commissioned to sculpt a bust of the Croatian Poglavnik Ante Paveliƒá.Milovan Djilas, Memoir of a revolutionary. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1973. (p. 346) In 1943, he defected to the Yugoslav Partisans' movement and the same year made the bust of Josip Broz Tito in Jajce. In 1946 Augustinƒçiƒá became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, and after the war he was made a member of the People's Assembly. In 1949 he was made a full member of the Yugoslav Academy, and from the 1950s onwards he started making portraits, art nudes and figurative sculptures. In the years after the war he made a number of notable sculptures, such as the monuments to Josip Broz Tito in Tito's birthplace of Kumrovec (1948), politician Mo≈°a Pijade (1953), violinist Zlatko Balokoviƒá (1962), 16th century Croatian writer Marin Dr≈æiƒá (1963) and many others. His most important sculpture in this period is The Carrying of the Wounded (), which evolved from a sketch made in 1944 and which he used as a recurring motif in a number of monuments he created in the following three decades, one of which can be seen in front of the Faculty of Medicine in Zagreb. Augustinƒçiƒá, together with the Serbian painter ƒêorƒëe Andrejeviƒá-Kun, also designed all of the Yugoslav orders and decorations, and he also created the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (with Vanja Radau≈°). In 1970 Augustinƒçiƒá donated his works to his native town of Klanjec, where a gallery exhibiting his works opened in 1976. His last great work was the memorial dedicated to the 1573 Peasants' Revolt and its leader Matija Gubec, which was erected near Or≈°iƒá Castle in Gornja Stubica in 1973.

Lipomo borders the following municipalities: Capiago Intimiano, Como, Montorfano, Tavernerio.  History  A forerunner of modern-day Lipomo was presumably founded in Roman times, at the time when Julius Caesar conquered Como. For all the imperial era Lipomo, given its proximity to Como and on a hill, Lipomo may have been a shelter from the invasions of barbaric populations coming from the Lario area. In the Middle Ages, Lipomo was a small village which was attacked and almost completely destroyed by the inhabitants of nearby Cant√π in 1050, a battle which took place in the context of the disputes between the major local powers of Como and Milan. When in 1535 the Duchy of Milan fell under Spanish domination, Lipomo - like all the villages of the Pieve di Zezio in North Lombardy - followed the same fate; in 1656 the commune freed itself from feudal subjection by paying a duty based on the number of families present in the area. That was a decision of the Spanish government which, in search of new funds to replenish the always troubled state coffers, in 1647 had decided to sell certain areas as a fiefdom to a family of the Milanese and Spanish aristocracy, leaving the centers included in the area itself the possibility of redeeming themselves against the payment of money. However, Lipomo later entered under the domain of the De Herra family, of distant Spanish ancestry, who - until early XX century - owned a vast part of the agricultural land and real estate assets of Lipomo. When Napoleon I conquered Lombardy, Lipomo was aggregated to the XXII district of Como, while with the advent of the Cisalpine Republic it moved into the District I of Como. Following the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor on March 6, 1805, Lipomo was then included in the Canton II of Como, incorporated into the afore-mentioned District I of Como and becoming a suburb of Como. Some members of the Lipomo growing middle- class took part in the Italian Wars of Independence (1860) and to World War I. After World War II, which left the community particularly impoverished, in 1946, the De Herra family and their latest heirs belonging to the Melano di Portula and Tanzi families, sold all the remaining real estate and agricultural properties. A rapid and turbulent industrial development took place with a consequent demographic increase, particularly in the textile and mechanic industry.

Under United States law, insurance companies owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to the persons they insure. This duty is often referred to as the \\"implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\\" which automatically exists by operation of law in every insurance contract. If an insurance company violates that covenant, the insured person (or \\"policyholder\\") may sue the company on a tort claim in addition to a standard breach of contract claim. The contract-tort distinction is significant because as a matter of public policy, punitive or exemplary damages are unavailable for contract claims, but are available for tort claims. In addition, consequential damages for breach of contract are traditionally subject to certain constraints not applicable to compensatory damages in tort actions (see Hadley v. Baxendale).Eugene R. Anderson, Jordan S. Stanzler, & Lorelie S. Masters, Insurance Coverage Litigation (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2020-1 supp.), ¬ß 11.01 at 11-6. The result is that a plaintiff in an insurance bad faith case may be able to recover an amount larger than the original face value of the policy, if the insurance company's conduct was particularly egregious. Historical background Most laws regulating the insurance industry in the United States are state-specific. In 1869, the Supreme Court of the United States held, in Paul v. Virginia (1869), that United States Congress did not have the authority to regulate insurance under its power to regulate commerce. In the 1930s and 1940s, a number of U.S. Supreme Court decisions broadened the interpretation of the Commerce Clause in various ways, so that federal jurisdiction over interstate commerce could be seen as extending to insurance. In March 1945, the United States Congress expressly reaffirmed its support for state-based insurance regulation by passing the McCarran‚ÄìFerguson Act which held that no law that Congress passed should be construed to invalidate, impair or supersede any law enacted by a state regarding insurance. As a result, nearly all regulation of insurance continues to take place at the state level. Such regulation generally comes in two forms. First, each state has an \\"Insurance Code\\" or some similarly named statute which attempts to provide comprehensive regulation of the insurance industry and of insurance policies, a specialized type of contract. State insurance codes generally mandate specific procedural requirements for starting, financing, operating, and winding down insurance companies, and often require insurers to be overcapitalized (relative to other companies in the larger financial services sector) to ensure that they have enough funds to pay claims if the state is hit by multiple natural and man-made disasters at the same time. There is usually a Department of Insurance or Division of Insurance responsible for implementing the state insurance code and enforcing its provisions in administrative proceedings against insurers. Second, judicial interpretation of insurance contracts in disputes between policyholders and insurers takes place in the context of the aforementioned insurance-specific statutes as well as general contract law; the latter still exists only in the form of judge-made case law in most states. A few states like California and Georgia have gone farther and attempted to codify all of their contract law (not just insurance law) into statutory law. Early insurance contracts were considered to be contracts like any other, but first English (see uberrima fides) and then American courts recognized that insurers occupy a special role in society by virtue of their express or implied promise of peace of mind, as well as the severe vulnerability of insureds at the time they actually make claims (usually after a terrible loss or disaster). The key point of divergence between the United States and England on this issue is that unlike American courts, English courts have consistently refused to go further and broadly extend the duty of utmost good faith from the pre-contract period into the post-contract period. In turn, the development of the modern American cause of action for insurance bad faith can be traced to a landmarkEugene R. Anderson, Jordan S. Stanzler, & Lorelie S. Masters, Insurance Coverage Litigation (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2019-2 supp.), ¬ß 11.04 at 11-13 to 11-16. decision of the Supreme Court of California in 1958: Comunale v. Traders & General Ins. Co. Comunale was in the context of third- party liability insurance, but California later expanded the same rule in 1973 to first-party fire insurance in another landmark (2010 supplement.) decision, Gruenberg v. Aetna Ins. Co. During the 1970s, insurers argued that these early cases should be read as holding that it was bad faith to deny a claim only when the insurer already knew that it had no reasonable basis for denying the claim (i.e., when the insurer had already acquired information showing a potentially covered claim and denied it anyway). In other words, they contended that only intentional mistreatment of an insured should be actionable in bad faith, versus merely grossly negligent claim handling. In 1979, California's highest court refuted that argument and further expanded the scope of the tort by holding that inadequate investigation of a claim was actionable in tort as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Other state courts began to follow California's lead and held that a tort claim exists for policyholders that can establish bad faith on the part of insurance carriers. By 2012, at least 46 states had recognized third-party bad faith as an independent tort, and at least 31 states had recognized first- party bad faith as an independent tort. A few states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania declined to allow tort claims for first-party insurance bad faith and instead allowed policyholders to recover broader damages for breach of contract against first-party insurers, including punitive damages. Bad faith defined An insurance company has many duties to its policyholders. The kinds of applicable duties vary depending upon whether the claim is considered to be \\"first party\\" or \\"third party.\\" Bad faith can occur in either situation‚Äîby improperly refusing to defend a lawsuit or by improperly refusing to pay a judgment or settlement of a covered lawsuit. Bad faith is a fluid concept and is defined primarily by court decisions in case law. Examples of bad faith include undue delay in handling claims, inadequate investigation, refusal to defend a lawsuit, threats against an insured, refusing to make a reasonable settlement offer, or making unreasonable interpretations of an insurance policy. =First party= A common first party context is when an insurance company writes insurance on property that becomes damaged, such as a house or an automobile. In that case, the company is required to investigate the damage, determine whether the damage is covered, and pay the proper value for the damaged property. Bad faith in first party contexts often involves the insurance carrier's improper investigation and valuation of the damaged property (or its refusal to even acknowledge the claim at all). Bad faith can also arise in the context of first party coverage for personal injury such as health insurance or life insurance, but those cases tend to be rare. Most of them are preempted by ERISA.Kanne v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 867 F.2d 489 (9th Cir. 1988). =Third party= Third party situations (essentially, liability insurance) break down into at least two distinct duties, both of which must be fulfilled in good faith. First, the insurance carrier usually has a duty to defend a claim (or lawsuit) even if some or most of the lawsuit is not covered by the insurance policy. Unless the policy is expressly structured so that defense costs \\"eat away\\" at the policy limits (a so-called \\"self-consuming,\\" \\"wasting\\" or \\"burning limits\\" policy), the default rule is that the insurer must cover all defense costs regardless of the actual limit of coverage. In one of the most famous decisions of his career (involving Jerry Buss's bad faith lawsuit against Transamerica), Justice Stanley Mosk wrote: Texas (and a few other conservative states) follow an \\"eight-corners rule\\" under which the duty to defend is strictly governed by the \\"eight corners\\" of two documents: the complaint against the insured and the insurance policy.GuideOne Elite v. Fielder Road Baptist Church, 197 S.W.3d 305 (Tex. 2006). In many other states, including CaliforniaMontrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court, 6 Cal. 4th 287 (1993). and New York,Fitzpatrick v. American Honda Co., 78 N.Y.2d 61 (1991). the duty to defend is ascertained by also looking to all facts known to the insurer from any source; if those facts when read together with the complaint show that at least one claim is potentially covered (that is, the complaint actually alleges a claim of the kind which the insurer promised to defend or could be so amended in light of the known facts), the duty to defend is thereby triggered and the insurer must undertake the defense of its insured. This powerful bias in favor of finding coverage is one of the major innovations of U.S. law. Other common law jurisdictions outside of the U.S. continue to construe coverage much more narrowly. Next, the insurer has a duty of indemnification, which is the duty to pay a judgment entered against the policyholder, up to the limit of coverage. However, unlike the duty to defend, the duty to indemnify exists only to the extent that the final judgment is for a covered act or omission, since by that point, there should be a clear factual record from trial or summary judgment in the plaintiff's favor revealing what portions of the plaintiff's claims are actually covered by the policy (as distinguished from potentially covered). Therefore, most insurance companies exercise a great deal of control over litigation. In some jurisdictions, like California, third party coverage also contains a third duty, the duty to settle a reasonably clear claim against the policyholder within policy limits, in order to avoid the risk that the policyholder may be hit with a judgment in excess of the value of the policy (which a plaintiff might then attempt to satisfy by writ of execution on the policyholder's assets). If the insurer breaches in bad faith its duties to defend, indemnify, and settle, it may be liable for the entire amount of any judgment obtained by a plaintiff against the policyholder, even if that amount is in excess of policy limits. This was the holding of the landmark Comunale case. Litigation U.S. courts usually follow the American rule in which parties bear their own attorney's fees in the absence of statute or contract, which means that in most states, bad faith litigation must be financed solely by the plaintiff, either out-of-pocket or through a contingent fee arrangement. (Insurance policies in the U.S. generally lack fee-shifting clauses, so that insurers can consistently invoke the default \\"bear your own fees\\" American rule.) However, in California, the plaintiff who prevails on a tort claim in a bad faith action may be able to recover part of its attorneys' fees separately and in addition to the judgment for damages against a defendant insurer, but only up to the extent that those fees were incurred in recovering contractual damages (that is, for breach of the terms of the insurance policy), as opposed to tort damages (for breach of the implied covenant).Cassim v. Allstate Ins. Co., 33 Cal. 4th 780 (2004). Oddly, the allocation of attorneys' fees between those two categories is itself a question of fact (meaning it usually goes to the jury). =Assignment or direct action= In some U.S. states, bad faith is even more complicated because under certain circumstances, a liability insurer may ultimately find itself in a trial where it is being sued directly by the plaintiff who originally sued its insured. This is allowed through two situations: assignment or direct action. The first situation is where an insured abandoned in bad faith by its liability insurer makes a special settlement agreement with the plaintiff. Sometimes this occurs after trial, where the insured has attempted to defend himself or herself by paying for a lawyer out of pocket, but went to verdict and lost (the actual situation in the landmark Comunale case); other times it occurs before trial and the parties agree to put on an uncontested show trial that results in a final verdict and judgment against the insured. Either way, the plaintiff agrees to not actually execute on the final judgment against the insured in exchange for an assignment of the assignable components of the insured's causes of action against its insurer.Essex Ins. Co. v. Five Star Dye House, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 1252 (2006). In some states, these agreements are named after the state's landmark case that adopted the Comunale doctrine (either directly or from one of its progeny). For example, in Arizona, they are known as Damron agreements.Safeway Ins. Co., Inc., v. Guerrero, 106 P.3d 1020, 1022 n.1 (2005). The second situation is where the plaintiff does not need to obtain a judgment first, but instead proceeds directly against the insured's insurer under a state statute authorizing such a \\"direct action.\\" These statutes have been upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.Watson v. Employers Liability Assurance Corp., . The broadest forms of direct action statutes are found in only four American jurisdictions: the states of Louisiana and Wisconsin, and the federal territories of Guam and Puerto Rico.Eugene R. Anderson, Jordan S. Stanzler, & Lorelie S. Masters, Insurance Coverage Litigation (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2018-2 supp.), ¬ß 19.07 at 19-95. =Damages= In many states, either the common law tort or an equivalent statute authorizes punitive damages for bad faith to further incentivize insurers to act in good faith towards their insureds. Bad faith lawsuits may result in large awards of punitive damages. A famous example is State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, in which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a jury verdict of $145 million in punitive damages against State Farm.State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, . Bad faith cases may also be slow, at least in the third party context, because they are necessarily dependent upon the outcome of any underlying litigation. For example, the 2003 Campbell decision involved State Farm's handling of litigation resulting from a fatal car accident in 1981, 22 years earlier. Another important feature of Campbell is that it powerfully illustrates how an insurer cannot avoid tort liability for bad faith by belatedly attempting to cure its breach of contract. State Farm's belated payment of the judgment against its insured did not prevent the Utah Supreme Court from still holding it liable (after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the original judgment) for $9 million in punitive damages. Toxic mold is a common cause of bad faith lawsuits, with about half of the 10,000 toxic mold cases in 2001 being filed against insurance companies on bad faith grounds. Before 2000 the claims were uncommon, with relatively low payouts. One notable lawsuit occurred when a Texas jury awarded $32 million (later reduced to $4 million). In 2002 a suit was settled for $7.2 million.Hartwig RP, Wilkinson C. (2003). Mold and Insurance. Insurance Issue Series. International comparison No other common law jurisdiction has gone as far as the United States in recognizing a separate tort based on an insurer's bad faith treatment of an insured, although Canada has come quite close. In 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld an award of punitive damages for an insurer's bad faith claims handling, but expressly refused to recognize insurance bad faith as an independent tort under Ontario law, and instead held that when extremely egregious, an insurer's breach of contract becomes an \\"actionable wrong\\" (something different than a tort) which justifies punitive damages.Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., 2002 SCC 18, [2002] 1 SCR 595. Since then, one Canadian appellate court, the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, has gone farther and expressly embraced the American concept of a tort of insurance bad faith.Walsh v. Nicholls [2004] NBJ No. 281. New Zealand's then-highest court in 1998 refused to decide the issue of whether to impose extracontractual tort liability for bad faith claims handling.State Insurance Ltd v. Cedenco Foods Ltd (CA 216/97, 6 August 1998), p. 7. The United Kingdom has refused to adopt the tort of insurance bad faith,Banque Keyser Ullmann SA v. Skandia (UK) Insurance Co Ltd. [1990] 1 QB 665.Banque Financiere de la Cite SA v. Westgate Insurance Co. Ltd. [1991] 2 AC 249, 280. and has also refused to impose broader consequential damages for bad faith claims handling.Sprung v. Royal Insurance (UK) Ltd [1999] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 111. The Australian Law Reform Commission considered but declined to adopt a tort of insurance bad faith when it drafted the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. Since then, Australian courts have consistently refused to judicially impose what Parliament did not legislatively impose, of which the most recent example was when the New South Wales Court of Appeal refused to adopt insurance bad faith in 2007.CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Limited (CAN 003 181 002) v.

It is the home field for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the Triple-A level minor league baseball affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. Coca-Cola Park accommodates 10,178 fans, including auxiliary areas (Capital BlueCross Lawn, Dugout Suites and Red Robin Tiki Terrace), and cost $50.25 million to build. Naming rights to the stadium were awarded to Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of the Lehigh Valley on March 7, 2007. Features The stadium features the Majestic Clubhouse, which houses all team apparel. The Bud Light Trough is an area immediately behind the right field wall that provides patrons the opportunity to stand and socialize during the game. The \\"pig\\" theme is used in the majority of concession stands and stores. The PPL Picnic Patio is an area immediately adjacent to left field that features buffet style food and can be booked for group outings. The club level of the stadium features an indoor concourse with access to the club level seats, the suites and the two PenTeleData Party Porches. The VIP Dugout Suites are situated immediately behind home plate and provide a unique viewing experience. The LVHN Children's Hospital KidsZone features a free playground area. In addition, kids can take advantage of a number of games, including speed pitch, slides and more. In 2012, the park added the Capital Blue Tiki Terrace in Left Field over the bullpens which features large group seating, tables for four, and a bar area accessible to all ticketed fans. The stadium maximum capacity is 10,178 (8,278 seats plus seating for 1,900 on the grass berm in center field). There is one main scoreboard which is located at the 400' mark on the field. The scoreboard consists of a 20' √ó 50' high definition video board, a 76' √ó 4' LED ribbon board, as well as the park's iconic classic Coca-Cola bottle which also serves as a firework launcher when a run is scored. Coca-Cola Park has a wide variety of seating including a grass berm, picnic benches, fold-down seats, and standing room. The initial estimate of the IronPigs stadium was $48.4 million. Its final price tag of $50.25 million, just 4 percent over the estimate, makes the minor league field one of the most expensive in the U.S. More information View of Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania from outdoor press box. 263x263px Groundbreaking ceremonies for the new ballpark were held on September 6, 2006, and construction was completed in February 2008. Coca-Cola Park was built on land formerly owned by LSI Corporation. The field dimensions and wall heights are the same as Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, except left field is six feet closer (323 feet, with the addition of the new \\"Pig Pen\\" seating section in 2015, to the foul pole compared to 329), center field is one foot shorter and the right field foul pole is five feet closer (325 feet in Allentown compared to 330 feet at Citizens Bank Park). With its completion, Coca-Cola Park is Allentown's newest stadium, but it is not the city's largest. That distinction belongs to J. Birney Crum Stadium, which has a seating capacity in excess of 15,000, and is the second largest outdoor high school stadium in Pennsylvania. The layout of Coca-Cola Park is slightly different from most ballparks, as the main entrance is located on the right field line rather than the common location behind home plate. Fans with club seating tickets, however, do have a designated entrance behind home plate. A surprising moment of the park's opening season came on July 2, 2008, when musician John Mayer attended a Lehigh Valley IronPigs game and caught a foul ball. Mayer had kept a low profile until the television cameras spotted him with the ball. Mayer eventually autographed the ball, which now sits in the Majestic Clubhouse Store. The park hosted its first major non-sporting event on July 14, 2009, with a concert headlined by Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp. More than 10,000 people attended the five-hour show, which was sold out. Following the event's success, Coca-Cola Park management indicated there was a good possibility other concerts would be held at the park in the future. The stadium hosted the 2010 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 2‚Äì1.

It was the successor to the earlier BBC political television series This Week, Next Week, which had aired on BBC One from 18 November 1984 until 12 June 1988, and been presented by David Dimbleby. A total of 492 episodes were produced over fifteen series, and apart from two special ones, they were all sixty minutes long. The programme was initially presented by Dimbleby's younger brother, Jonathan Dimbleby, from its first episode on 18 September 1988 until its 178th one on 18 July 1993, but it was later presented by John Humphrys as of its 179th episode on 19 September 1993 until its last one on 15 December 2002. With the exceptions of the two special ones on 12 April 1992 and 18 November 2001, every episode ran for sixty minutes, and most of them started with a filmed piece about a major issue of the day before returning to the studio in which the presenter would \\"grill\\" a leading politician on the same issue. A long-running segment of the programme was a political sketch that would be presented by the late John Cole (1927-2013), and for its sixth series in 1993, its theme song (which had been composed by George Fenton, but he was not credited) was revised in order to incorporate Cole's section within the programme with his own jingles. The programme's mascot was an enormous mutant crocodile, based on a British House of Commons gargoyle and the Great Westminster Clock, and fashioned from plastic, glue and leather. For the opening titles of the first five series, the crocodile marched across the United Kingdom, but for those of the sixth to fifteenth series, it marched across Europe (and as of 5 October 1997, the then-new BBC logo, which had usurped the previous underlined one from 1988 only the day before, was faded in at the start of the titles). Both sequences were shot in stop-motion animation by 3 Peach Animation, and at the end of most of the episodes from the sixth to fifteenth series, the credits \\"flew\\" into the crocodile's open mouth as it occasionally blinked, before it closed its mouth and lowered its head as the BBC logo of the time, the copyright notice and the editor's credit (along with the programme's website address as of 27 April 1997), appeared. During 2000, the then-current BBC Director General Greg Dyke ordered a review of political output from the BBC, which was carried out by Fran Unsworth. This led to a major overhaul of their political output in 2002, resulting in On the Record being axed and replaced by The Politics Show. The fifteenth series only comprised 12 episodes, and the final one was aired on 15 December 2002.

Before birth, these disorders result in the abnormal development of structures including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. .  Presentation  Actor Michael Berryman displays outward symptoms of the condition Most people with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia have a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) because they have fewer sweat glands than normal or their sweat glands do not function properly. Sweating is a major way that the body controls its temperature; as sweat evaporates from the skin, it cools the body. An inability to sweat can lead to a dangerously high body temperature (hyperthermia) particularly in hot weather. In some cases, hyperthermia can cause life-threatening medical problems. Affected individuals tend to have sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis). The hair is often light-coloured, brittle, and slow-growing. This condition is also characterized by absent teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are malformed. The teeth that are present are frequently small and pointed. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is associated with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, thick lips, and a flattened bridge of the nose. Additional features of this condition include thin, wrinkled, and dark-colored skin around the eyes; chronic skin problems such as eczema; and a bad-smelling discharge from the nose (ozena).Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia in humans. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 17,000 people worldwide.  Genetics  Mutations in the EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD genes cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. The EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together during embryonic development. These proteins form part of a signaling pathway that is critical for the interaction between two cell layers, the ectoderm and the mesoderm. In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues. Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia has several different inheritance patterns. = EDA (X-linked) = Most cases are caused by mutations in the EDA gene, which are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, called x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED). A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. Since females operate on only one of their two X chromosomes (X inactivation) a female carrier may or may not manifest symptoms of the disease. If a female carrier is operating on her normal X she will not show symptoms. If a female is operating on her carrier X she will show symptoms. In about 70 percent of cases, carriers of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia experience some features of the condition. These signs and symptoms are usually mild and include a few missing or abnormal teeth, sparse hair, and some problems with sweat gland function. Some carriers, however, have more severe features of this disorder.  Treatments  In January 2013, Edimer Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, MA, USA, initiated a Phase I, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic clinical study of EDI200, a drug aimed at the treatment of XLHED. During development in mice and dogs EDI200 has been shown to substitute for the altered or missing protein resulting from the EDA mutation which causes XLHED. A second trial in newborn infants with XLHED tested the synthetic protein in 10 subjects between 2013 and 2016 at 6 sites in the US and Europe. As the treated group \\"didn‚Äôt see significant changes in sweat gland function and other early markers of biologic activity\\", prenatal administration of the drug was considered. Following the Edimer trials, Dr. Holm Schneider, the principal investigator of these trials which indicated sufficient safety of the replacement protein, injected EDI200 via amniocentesis with better development of tooth buds and sweat glands than in the postnatal trial and persistent sweating ability in all three treated boys . = EDAR or EDARADD (autosomal) = Less commonly, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia results from mutations in the EDAR or EDARADD gene. EDAR mutations can have an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, and EDARADD mutations have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Terminology The eponym Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome was named after its discoverers: Josef Christ (1871‚Äì1948), a German dentist and physician from Wiesbaden, who was the first physician to identify the condition, Hermann Werner Siemens (1891‚Äì1969), a pioneering German dermatologist from Charlottenburg, who clearly identified its pathological characteristics in the early 1930s, and Albert Touraine (1883‚Äì1961), a French dermatologist who likewise noted and identified additional characteristics of the disease in the late 1930s.

He lost his reelection bid for a seventh term to Democratic challenger Brad Ellsworth in the 2006 midterm election, ending a twelve-year congressional career. In 2010, he was a Republican candidate for the open U.S. Senate seat in the state of Indiana held by retiring Senator Evan Bayh. On December 3, 2009, Hostettler announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, but lost the primary to former Senator Dan Coats.\\"Indiana Senate: Ellsworth Trails GOP Hopefuls ‚Äì Before Health Care Vote\\", RASMUSSEN REPORTS, March 23, 2010.Kyle Trygstad, \\"Indiana US Senate Poll: Hostettler Outpolling Coats\\", Real Clear Politics at TIME.COM, March 1, 2010. Early life Hostettler (pronounced HOH-stet-luhr) was born in Evansville, as the eighth of ten children. He is of Swiss German and Irish descent. He grew up in rural Posey County near the Ohio and Wabash rivers. After graduating from North Posey High School in 1979, he enrolled in Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) in 1983. Later that year, Hostettler married his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth Ann Hamman. They live in Blairsville, an unincorporated suburban community near Evansville, and have four children. He is a longtime member and former deacon of Westwood General Baptist Church (formerly Twelfth Avenue General Baptist Church) in Evansville.

Congressional tenure Hostettler earlier in his congressional career Hostettler became part of the 104th Congress, the first Republican majority in the House in 40 years. In subsequent years, Hostettler depended on his base of fellow social and fiscal conservatives to keep him in office. While southern Indiana has been traditionally Democratic, the 8th has always had a strong social conservative tint. Hostettler's campaign was distinctive in several respects. One of Hostettler's assets in his run for Congress was his distinctive \\"Red Army\\" or \\"Army of Red Volunteers.\\" Parades and similar events would typically feature people of varying backgrounds wearing red t-shirts with white lettering that simply stated \\"Hostettler for Congress\\". Hostettler family members were particularly involved in campaign efforts. Karen Hammonds, Hostettler's sister, was also his office manager and a campaign coordinator. Being one of ten children, his brothers and sisters have assisted in campaign efforts. Media has attributed this as an area of success and influence that helped Hostettler achieve six straight victories.\\"Race Profile: The 8th District of Indiana\\", NYTimes.com.

The suburb has a relatively high proportion of miners, consultants, and especially medical specialists as compared with the Perth CBD. Streets such as Colin Street, Ord Street, and Outram Street have a significant percentage of office and high density residential buildings. Most retail outlets are located on Hay Street, which is the main commercial zone for the suburb, and these are focused on serving the office population. Closer to the CBD, the eastern edge of the suburb features both the Watertown brand outlet complex and the City West complex.

Diffusion, in architectural acoustics, is the spreading of sound energy evenly in a given environment. A perfectly diffusive sound space is one in which the reverberation time is the same at any listening position. Most interior spaces are non-diffusive; the reverberation time is considerably different around the room. At low frequencies they suffer from prominent resonances called room modes.  Diffusor  Diffusors (or diffusers) are used to treat sound aberrations, such as echoes, in rooms. They are an excellent alternative or complement to sound absorption because they do not remove sound energy, but can be used to effectively reduce distinct echoes and reflections while still leaving a live sounding space. Compared to a reflective surface, which will cause most of the energy to be reflected off at an angle equal to the angle of incidence, a diffusor will cause the sound energy to be radiated in many directions, hence leading to a more diffusive acoustic space. It is also important that a diffusor spreads reflections in time as well as spatially. Diffusors can aid sound diffusion, but this is not why they are used in many cases; they are more often used to remove coloration and echoes. Diffusors come in many shapes and materials. The birth of modern diffusors was marked by Manfred R. Schroeders' invention of number-theoretic diffusors in the 1970s. = Maximum length sequence diffusors = MLS Diffusor Maximum length sequence based diffusors are made of strips of material with two different depths. The placement of these strips follows an MLS. The width of the strips is smaller than or equal to half the wavelength of the frequency where the maximum scattering effect is desired. Ideally, small vertical walls are placed between lower strips, improving the scattering effect in the case of tangential sound incidence. The bandwidth of these devices is rather limited; at one octave above the design frequency, diffusor efficiency drops to that of a flat surface. = Quadratic-residue diffusors = 1000Hz Quadratic-Residue Diffusor MLS based diffusors are superior to geometrical diffusors in many respects; they have limited bandwidth. The new goal was to find a new surface geometry that would combine the excellent diffusion characteristics of MLS designs with wider bandwidth. A new design was discovered, called a quadratic residue diffusor. Today the quadratic residue diffusor or Schroeder diffusor is still widely used. Quadratic-Residue Diffusors can be designed to diffuse sound in either one or two directions. = Primitive-root diffusors = Primitive-root diffusors are based on a number theoretic sequence based on primitive roots. Although they produce a notch in the scattering response, in reality the notch is over too narrow a bandwidth to be useful. In terms of performance, they are very similar to Quadratic-Residue Diffusors. = Optimized diffusors = By using numerical optimisation, it is possible to increase the number of theoretical designs, especially for diffusors with a small number of wells per period. But the big advantage of optimisation is that arbitrary shapes can be used which can blend better with architectural forms. = Two-dimensional (\\"hemispherical\\") diffusors = Example of a 2D acoustic diffusor using QRD method Designed, like most diffusors, to create \\"a big sound in a small room,\\" unlike other diffusors, two-dimensional diffusors scatter sound in a hemispherical pattern. This is done by the creation of a grid, whose cavities have wells of varying depth, according to the matrix addition of two quadratic sequences equal or proportionate to those of a regular diffusor.More on the diffraction theory of Schroeder diffusors Hans Werner Strube, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 70, 633 (1981), These diffusors are very helpful for controlling the direction of the diffusion, particularly in studios and control rooms.

Blumann studied at the Royal School of Art in Berlin between 1917 and 1919, whilst also maintaining friendships and associations with artists at the Academy of Arts. Notably, Blumann recounted sitting for a portrait for artist Max Liebermann and also described his teaching methods although no verifiable evidence is available to confirm Liebermann as her tutor. After this, Blumann taught in various schools in Germany from 1920 to 1923, when she married Arnold Blumann. She fled Nazi Germany with her husband in 1934, arriving at the port of Fremantle, Western Australia on the passenger liner Ormonde on January 4, 1938. In the decade following her arrival in Western Australia, Blumann produced a significant body of painting, taking as her subject the Western Australian landscape, her family and her new circle of friends. These works investigate the unique light and colour of the Western Australian landscape in a style informed by her knowledge of German Expressionism. Among these were Summer Nude, 1939, which caused a scandal when exhibited in Western Australia in 1944 due to both its depiction of nudity and its bold, simple shapes and lines. With the then Curator of the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Robert Campbell, she helped found the Art Group, a discussion group through which she promoted modernist ideas and attitudes in art and art education. In the 1950s Blumann became disillusioned with the possibilities of art in Western Australia and only painted sporadically. Her work first received national attention in the late 1970s some fifteen years before she died in 1990, aged 93. She has since been acknowledged as a significant contributor to Australian modernist painting, prefiguring the development of the similarly landscape-based modernism in Western Australia associated with painters Guy Grey-Smith and Howard Taylor.

The ‚Äúprophetesses of Pusiano‚Äù proclaimed in the 1850s that the messages they were allegedly receiving from God (the ‚ÄúHoly Word‚Äù) were the third testament of the divine revelation, and that the Papal States and the Austrian Empire would both disappear if they would not officially recognize the new revelation. The Isacchi sisters were supported by some local priests in Pusiano, while cardinal Andrea Carlo Ferrari in Milan and the Vatican regarded them as just mentally disturbed.

He was born in Leeds in 1914; he died in Reading, Berkshire in 1996. Life and career According to his family, Baim left Leeds after the death of his father in 1929 and moved to London in 1931. Baim originally wanted to be a journalist but instead gained employment working the clapperboard for film producers at MGM and Renown Pictures. Baim then worked for film producer and distributor George Minter and moved on to Columbia Pictures selling their films to the Odeon, ABC and Gaumont cinema chains. Baim became a prolific producer of 35mm short films, creating over 300 titles in his lifetime. The subjects of his early films, made by his company The Federated Film Corporation, were released in the early 1940s and featured well known music hall and variety theatre acts such as Wilson, Keppel and Betty. His later and more well known films were mainly travelogues filmed in England, Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, America and Asia as well as music compilations featuring footage of well-known pop music acts of the era. Nearly all of the Baim titles released after 1957 are in colour using 'Eastman-color' film stock and were produced for distribution by United Artists in the UK. Many are in wide-screen formats. Baim was keen to use wide screen and the paper archive shows he rented 'Camera-scope' lenses from Adelphi Films in the mid 1950s. A project to restore and digitise the surviving films was started in 1999 by The Baim Collection Limited. After twenty years work over eighty of the surviving one-hundred and thirty titles have been restored and are available for licence. More than seventy films are thought lost http://www.baimfilms.com/lost.asp . A selection of more than one hundred of the films are available for review by researchers and producers on-line via Vimeo. From 2012 until 2016, eight titles made up part of the programming on Sky Arts in HD: Swinging UK, UK Swings Again, Girls Girls Girls!, Big City, Telly Savalas Looks at Birmingham, Get 'Em Off, Playground Spectacular and Jugglers and Acrobats. BBC Television Entertainment Department produced a television programme entitled Harold Baim's Britain on Film featuring 30 minutes of clips from twenty-three of the British films. Part of the \\"On Film\\" series it was first broadcast on BBC 4 on 27 July 2011, repeated 29 May 2012. The programme was received enthusiastically by reviewers and critics in newspaper reviews after the first transmission in The Telegraph, The Independent, The London Evening Standard and The Mirror which are available on-line. Clips and excerpts from the Baim Collection are often used as illustrative footage in feature films and television documentaries seen on BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Four and by producers of programmes screened by ITV and Channel Four Television in the UK. The feature film THE DUKE which premiered at the 2020 Venice Film Festival makes use of Baim images from the early ‚Äò60s. The Baim Collection continues to search for lost prints and negatives of over one hundred missing titles produced by Harold Baim. Many of the missing films were produced between 1945 and 1957, the earlier ones most probably on nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate) film stock which is unstable and liable to spontaneously combust. Surviving films from this time would have been transferred to 16mm or 35 mm safety film stock. One such film is Science Is Golden (1949), which was returned to The Baim Collection Limited in 2010 after a 16mm black-and-white print of the film was discovered in a school cupboard. The film was returned by the Department of English and Media at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. The film features Professor Low, who shows how to make \\"home made\\" explosives for use in \\"magic tricks\\" and also shows a very early domestic microwave oven and other household labour-saving gadgets for the home, accompanied by the unique Harold Baim script. In 2013 MGM/UA in London discovered a number of Baim films made in the late 1950s and early '60s in their vaults at Denham and have kindly returned the titles to The Baim Collection. The titles include \\"Cormorant Fishing\\", \\"Cotswold Craftsmen\\" and \\"Where The Avon Flows\\". These films have been digitised by deluxe142 in London and are now added to the Collection. MGM/UA have also returned elements missing from other films, a total of 36 cans of 35mm and 16mm negative and prints. In November 2013 The Media Archive for Central England (MACE) discovered a 16mm print of the \\"lost\\" Baim black and white film about magic and magicians, \\"Say Abracadabra\\". The film dates from 1952 and MACE kindly returned it to the Collection. The film was digitised at deluxe 142 Wardour Street in London who also transferred the 1946 film \\"Stadium Highlights\\" from Nitrate stock. This Nitrate film has been stored for many years by the BFI in the National Archive and has not been seen since its original release. The subject matter is The Empire Pool Wembley. In June 2015 the 1965 film \\"The Mood Man\\" was also transferred from the original 35mm negative to HD files by Encore at 142 Wardour Street in London. The film features Ross McManus singing \\"If I Had A Hammer\\" and the original negative was transferred to HD for use in a concert tour by Ross MacManus' son, Elvis Costello. Prior to this transfer a copy of the film originating from a 16mm print had been the only copy of the film available. The 35mm negative of the Ross McManus song was released to Cinelab London who transferred the extract to 4K and undertook further minor restoration for a DVD release of Elvis Costello's 2015 tour. Digital copies (ProRes files) of over 80 titles transferred from the original negative including these recently rediscovered titles, have been donated to the BFI's National Archive. The travelogues are perhaps the best known and best remembered of Baim's output. Baim wrote the scripts which were recorded by well known actors and broadcasters of the period including the voice-over talents of Valentine Dyall, David Gell, Peter Dimmock, Terry Wogan, Ed Bishop, Franklin Engelmann, Kenneth MacLeod and Nicholas Parsons. Harold Baim applied a consistent formula to the creation of his films. No one addresses the camera; the camera becomes the narrator's 'eyes' as they interpret the scene. Wherever he went from Alsace to Aberdeen, (alliteration was a well-used device in the Baim formula) he took the same consistent approach in introducing his subjects to the audience. He often opened a travelogue by featuring transport facilities such as motorways, bus stations and airports (a particular favourite). Then he'd record the old town, educate the audience with a bit of history and then contrast this with new \\"sophisticated\\" office blocks and shopping centres. The shadow of World War Two looms large in the films. The overseas travel depicted was a world away from the holiday aspirations experienced by the everyday British cinema-goer who, at the time, was much more likely to have ventured no further afield than the British seaside. Not everyone in the industry was a fan of Baim and he was attacked in publications, notably in a slim volume entitled \\"A Long Look at Short Films\\" published in 1966. In November of that year Baim took part in a BBC television programme entitled \\"The Look of the Week\\" where he robustly defended his work. Baim provided an early career boost for Michael Winner (1935‚Äì2013) who directed and scripted five Baim films from 1959 to 1963. Winner gained his first Associate Producer credit on Floating Fortress concerning life on aircraft carrier HMS Victorious. Winner also directed the popular comedy about modern manners Behave Yourself. This is one of the few Baim films in which actors speak and is one of a small number of surviving titles shot in black and white. Michael Winner makes a fleeting appearance in the title sequence of Behave Yourself. Also amongst the Winner titles (where he can also be glimpsed as an airline passenger at the start of the film) is the feature-length musical The Cool Mikado starring Frankie Howerd and Tommy Cooper based on the comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan. An unrestored copy of this film was released on DVD by Strike Force Entertainment. The title is now deleted from their catalogue but second-hand copies are available on-line. The other surviving black and white films are Playing the Game, a comic look at the game of golf released in 1967, A Pocket Full of Rye, Where The Avon Flows, Our Mr Shakespeare, Cartoons and Cartoonists, The Things People Do, Stadium Highlights, and Science is Golden. Several 'B' features were also made by Baim, including the haunted house thriller Night Comes Too Soon (aka The Ghost of Rashmon Hall) and The Fantastic World of Film a compilation of early silent American comedy films. The Baim short films were originally created for the British cinema and mainly made for distribution with United Artists features enabling the chain to meet legal requirements for the minimum number of UK- made productions shown. The legislation was first introduced in the 1927 Cinematograph Act. Sometimes these short documentary films were called Quota Quickies in the industry, due to the fact they were made to meet the Quota of UK productions required under cinema distribution legislation of the time. A radio documentary on Baim's films, entitled Telly Savalas and the Quota Quickies, was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 26 April 2008. Presenter Laurie Taylor investigated Baim's film legacy through the productions Telly Savalas Looks at Birmingham, Telly Savalas Looks at Portsmouth, and Telly Savalas Looks at Aberdeen. The radio programme together with more detailed information and films clips are available on the Baim Films website. Viewing copies of all titles mentioned above are held for public reference by the BFI and The Baim Collection.

McKinnon was born in Paisley and started his career at junior side Petershill before moving south of the border to join Carlisle United, then of the Lancashire Combination. He then moved even further south, joining London side Woolwich Arsenal in May 1908. Initially a reserve player, McKinnon made his debut on 12 December 1908 in a 4-1 defeat at the hands of Bradford City, and only made one more appearance in the 1908-09 season. He mainly played at left half, as an understudy to fellow Scot Roddy McEachrane, and it wasn't until 1911 did McKinnon supplant his countryman and become a regular in the Woolwich Arsenal side. McKinnon was a regular from then on, until official competition was suspended, a period with injury between March and November 1914 excepted. Unfortunately for him, his career with Woolwich Arsenal coincided with their relegation from the First Division in 1913; nevertheless he continued to serve Arsenal (as they had been renamed following their move to Highbury in 1913) as they pushed for promotion. On the issue of the name the volume \\"Woolwich Arsenal the club that changed football\\" traces the changes of the club's name and reports that for the 1914/15 season the club defined itself in the programmes and elsewhere as \\"The Arsenal\\" (not Arsenal) for the first time on 10 April 1914 but that name was not registered and that formally with the Board of Trade or the Joint Stock Companies, as would have been required to make the change official. During the war he served as a driver in the Royal Field Artillery, and returned to play for Arsenal, who had been elected back to the First Division, once competitive football resumed in 1919. Although by this time 32, he continued to play for Arsenal for another two seasons, and started the 1921-22 season as first-choice left half, before being replaced by the young Tom Whittaker. McKinnon was given a free transfer in the summer of 1922, having played 217 matches for Arsenal, scoring 4 goals. He signed for Charlton Athletic, where he played one season, and then moved to Wigan Borough but did not play a single league match for the club and retired in 1923. After retiring, he joined New Brighton; he spent 27 years at the club, between 1935 and 1962, as either trainer or coach. He died in 1968, at the age of 81.

The coat of arms depicts a blindfolded Moor imprisoned during the Crusades within a fortress. The laurel branches extol the city while serving as a reminder of vast oak forests which surrounded the village until the mid-19th century. Early history Various hypotheses have been advanced as to the meaning of the town's name. One explanation for the word \\"Rovello\\" is its derivation from the Celtic words rose (valley) and vel (fort); i.e., \\"valley fortress\\". If that interpretation is correct, it would point to a very early settlement, since groups of Celts settled in parts of northern Italy up to about 300 BCE. The area was definitely inhabited in Roman times, as confirmed by the 1977-78 discovery of some 40 tombs between Via Manzoni and Via Carducci. The tombs contained everyday objects related to daily life (mirrors, bracelets, lamps and vases, etc., as well as coins dating from the 1st century BCE up to the 1st century CE. During the Middle Ages the chaplain of the Rovello parish was Goffredo da Bussero, sometimes known as Gotifredo, a priest from Milan credited as the author of Notiti√¶ Mediolani Sanctorum, completed in the late 13th century, an important source for the diocesan history of the area. From this work it appears that four chapels were originally dedicated to St. Andrew (not mentioned in later centuries); Saints Euphemia and Ursula (recorded until the 15th century); Santa Maria della Lura; and St. Peter, since the 12th century dedicated to St. Paul as well. Little or nothing is known of Rovello during the rest of the Middle Ages, except for a short-lived peace treaty signed in Rovello and Lomazzo between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, warring factions from Como and Milan. In the countryside near Saronno was the residence of Matteo II Visconti (c. 1319‚Äì1355). In 1519 the local council of heads of families decided to entrust two local churches to the Carmelites, who occupied the Rovello convent till 1653, having pledged to celebrate a daily Mass and to teach reading and writing to local children. Early in the 17th century the monks began observing a feast day on the third Sunday in July with an annual procession and carrying a statue of the Madonna. In October 1652 Pope Innocent X decided to suppress all smaller monasteries, and Archbishop Alfonso Litta closed the Rovello monastery in 1653, ceding its building and property to the parish. In 1677, however, Marquis Cesare Pagani, a leading figure in Milan's public life, received permission to erect a chapel dedicated to Santa Maria del Carmine. He donated a wooden statue of the Madonna which is still revered today. Later history When Cesare Pagani died childless (1707) he had named as his heir his cousin Carlo Giuseppe Porro, a lawyer. Subsequently, several members of the Porro dynasty played significant roles in political, economic and cultural areas. Giovanni Pietro Porro (1773‚Äì1852) incorporated the Italian bank Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde in 1823 and served as the bank's president. Francesco Porro (1813‚Äì1848) was the village mayor and was a co-founder of Milan's Natural History Museum. Alessandro Porro (1814‚Äì1879) was a member of the provisional government of Milan during an uprising against the Austrian Empire. In 1926 Benito Mussolini's Gen. Carlo Porro (1854‚Äì1939) attached his family's name to the earlier town name of Rovello. During the 19th century the Santa Maria church became a part of the parish of Appiano and was expanded twice, first from 1804 to 1808, then again in 1872-73. Between 1925 and 1929 the architect Ugo Zanchetta completely rebuilt the Carmelite monastery, and from 1935 and 1939 the parish church, which had already been rebuilt in the late 18th century, was expanded to accommodate the town's increasing population. Architect Paolo Mezzanotte presented plans for a church expansion to cost 800,000 lire, and 12 granite columns, each 8.5m in height and 1m in diameter, were purchased from the municipality after the demolition of the atrium of the Fatebenefratelli Hospital (Azienda Ospedaliera Fatebenefratelli e Oftalmico). Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster laid the cornerstone on March 14, 1935 and consecrated the Pietro e Paolo church on September 30, 1939. The old church building remained beside the new and was not demolished until 1953, after two keystones broke and large cracks appeared in the wall, which were prohibitively expensive to repair. Between 1928 and 1945 the painter Vanni Rossi adorned the church with a cycle of frescoes. More recently the sculptor Giorgio Galletti added bronze doors, and Emiliano Viscardi produced frescoes by the two ovals of the transept. For the reconsecration of the church in July 1995, a new marble altar and mosaics were completed by sculptor Floriano Bodini, as well as stained-glass windows depicting Saint Francis of Assisi's Canticle of the Sun. In 2002 paintings by Valentino Vago were added to the church interior. In recent decades, construction activity has intensified in Rovello with the completion of new homes and such public works as a city hall and civic centre, elementary and middle schools, and the Opera Pia Carcano, a senior citizens housing project. Administration In the latter part of the 16th century Rovello had between 500 and 600 people in at least 80 families living in more than 40 houses situated around the present Piazza of Porro. The majority of the population were tenant farmers and labourers, but there were also specialized artisans (tailors, carpenters, bakers) and an innkeeper. A census conducted in 1751 listed the feudal Count Giovanni della Porta along with about 700 residents. The town had a general council of citizens, which would assemble when summoned by a bell, and a mayor and elected councillors known as the Console. Included in the Parish of Appiano, the City appears in the Indice delle pievi e comunit√† dello Stato di Milano (Index of churches and communities of Milan) in 1753 as still belonging to the Duchy of Milan. The feudal system ended in 1763 with the death of the Count. By 1771 the community had recorded a population of 1012. With the division of the Austrian province of Lombardy (September 26, 1786), Rovello was transferred to Gallarate province. Following the 1797 subdivision into departments, as required by the Constitution of the Cisalpine Republic (1797‚Äì1802), Rovello was added to the Verbano department, but it was transferred the following year to the Olona department; a 1799 census showed 1065 inhabitants. In 1801 the town was transferred anew into District II of Varese and became a part of the Lario department. In 1807 Rovello incorporated the surrounding district as the Comune di Rovellasca, but this was reversed in 1812. From 1816 under the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia the city of Rovello became a part of the Province of Como, District XXIII Appiano. After 1853 the city was assigned to District V of Appiano, now with a population of 1570. Transportation Rovello Porro is located on the LeNord railway which has trains running from Milan (Milano Cadorna) to Como (Nord) changing at Saronno for trains to Varese, to Novara, to Malpensa Airport and Erba. There is also a limited bus service. The A9 motorway (Turate junction) links Rovello to Milan (via A8), Como and Switzerland. Industry and commerce Benefiting from its transport routes into Milan and Como and excellent soil, Rovello has historically produced potatoes, corn and other fruits and vegetables. Agriculture has since waned in Rovello because of the heavy development experienced in the majority of the surrounding areas of Milan. Many of the buildings in the centre and surrounding areas used to be farmhouses. There is an annual potato festival in the town held in September. The majority of the current working population commute into the Milan area via Rail and Motorway routes. Light industrial units are located in and around Rovello and provide work for some of the local residents. The area has also experienced a recent influx of North Africans seeking cheaper housing and taking advantage of the transport links to other larger towns. Lura Park The Lura River rises in the municipality of Bizzarone bordering the Swiss canton of Ticino. Running south for 35 km, it has its confluence at Rho with the Olona River, which in turn flows into the Lambro. The Lura River traverses the entire Lura Park (Parco del Lura), meandering through low-sloped hilly areas flanked by woods, and helps to green an area of a thousand hectares skirting nine municipalities. Partially wooded with oak and locust trees, scattered pine forest and riparian woodland, approximately half of the park is agricultural, planted in grass and a stable cycle of cereal grains. In 1975 the nine municipalities established and funded a sanitation consortium, which constructed 30 km of sewer trunk lines to collect industrial and domestic wastewater and pipe it to a purification plant in Caronno Pertusella. The directors of the water purification project conceived the idea of a regional park in the area. In 1995 the Lombardy region officially recognized Lura Park. Several volunteer groups have helped to restore the area and to combat the environmental degradation that could have ruined many of the landscapes that Lura Park intends to preserve. Through the Lura Valley linking the provinces of Como and Varese there are forest groves and several old farmhouses, with a 1-km cycling path going from Saronno to Rovello Porro. After 1997 the park has been managed by the city of Cadorago, and in early 2000 a consortium with elected managers was established to operate the park.

Usually, the particles are photons, but in principle any bosonic field can support NOON states. Applications NOON states are an important concept in quantum metrology and quantum sensing for their ability to make precision phase measurements when used in an optical interferometer. For example, consider the observable : A = N,0\\\\rangle\\\\langle 0,N + 0,N\\\\rangle\\\\langle N,0. \\\\, The expectation value of A for a system in a NOON state switches between +1 and ‚àí1 when the phase changes from 0 to \\\\pi/N. Moreover, the error in the phase measurement becomes : \\\\Delta \\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta A}{d\\\\langle A\\\\rangle / d\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{1}{N}. This is the so-called Heisenberg limit, and gives a quadratic improvement over the standard quantum limit. NOON states are closely related to Schr√∂dinger cat states and GHZ states, and are extremely fragile. Towards experimental realization There have been several theoretical proposals for creating photonic NOON states. Kok, Lee, and Dowling proposed the first general method based on post-selection via photodetection. The down-side of this method was its exponential scaling of the success probability of the protocol. Pryde and White subsequently introduced a simplified method using intensity-symmetric multiport beam splitters, single photon inputs, and either heralded or conditional measurement. Their method, for example, allows heralded production of the N = 4 NOON state without the need for postselection or zero photon detections, and has the same success probability of 3/64 as the more complicated circuit of Kok et al. Cable and Dowling proposed a method that has polynomial scaling in the success probability, which can therefore be called efficient. Two-photon NOON states, where N = 2, can be created deterministically from two identical photons and a 50:50 beam splitter. This is called the Hong‚ÄìOu‚ÄìMandel effect in quantum optics. Three- and four-photon NOON states cannot be created deterministically from single-photon states, but they have been created probabilistically via post-selection using spontaneous parametric down- conversion. A different approach, involving the interference of non-classical light created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and a classical laser beam on a 50:50 beam splitter, was used by I. Afek, O. Ambar, and Y. Silberberg to experimentally demonstrate the production of NOON states up to N = 5. Super-resolution has previously been used as indicator of NOON state production, in 2005 Resch et al. showed that it could equally well be prepared by classical interferometry. They showed that only phase super-sensitivity is an unambiguous indicator of a NOON state; furthermore they introduced criteria for determining if it has been achieved based on the observed visibility and efficiency. Phase super sensitivity of NOON states with N = 2 was demonstrated and super resolution, but not super sensitivity as the efficiency was too low, of NOON states up to N = 4 photons was also demonstrated experimentally. History and terminology NOON states were first introduced by Barry C. Sanders in the context of studying quantum decoherence in Schr√∂dinger cat states. They were independently rediscovered in 2000 by Jonathan P. Dowling's group at JPL, who introduced them as the basis for the concept of quantum lithography. The term \\"NOON state\\" first appeared in print as a footnote in a paper published by Lee, Kok, and Dowling on Quantum metrology, where it was spelled N00N, with zeros instead of Os.

Arylsulfatase B is among a group of arylsulfatase enzymes present in the lysosomes of the liver, pancreas, and kidneys of animals. The purpose of the enzyme is to hydrolyze sulfates in the body. ARSB does this by breaking down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are large sugar molecules in the body. ARSB targets two GAGs in particular: dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate.U.S. National Library of Medicine. \\"ARSB\\", Genetics Home Resource, 7 November 2010, Retrieved 22 November 2010 Over 130 mutations to ARSB have been found, each leading to a deficiency in the body. In most cases, the mutation occurs on a single nucleotide in the sequence. An arylsulfatase B deficiency can lead to an accumulation of GAGs in lysosomes, which in turn can lead to mucopolysaccharidosis VI. Used as a pharmaceutical drug, the enzyme is known under the International Nonproprietary Name galsulfase and is sold under the brand name Naglazyme. Galsulfase was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2005 and in European Union in January 2006. Galsulfase is indicated for long-term enzyme-replacement therapy in people with a confirmed diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase deficiency; Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome).  Structure  The primary structure of Escherichia coli arylsulfatase B contains a primary sequence of 502 amino acids. Its secondary structure is quite complex, containing numerous alpha helices (20 total containing 138 residues) and beta sheets (21 strands total containing 87 residues). The functional enzyme is believed to be a homo tetramer. Due to the complexity of arylsulfatase B's secondary structure, many hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are present, as demonstrated by the Kyte- Doolittle hydropathy plot: Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot: enlarge for better viewing  Medical uses  Galsulfase is used to treat adults and children who have mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI or Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome). This disease is caused by the lack of an enzyme called N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, which is needed to break down substances in the body called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). If the enzyme is not present, GAGs cannot be broken down and they build up in the cells. This causes the signs of the disease, the most noticeable being a short body, a large head and difficulty moving about. The disease is usually diagnosed in infants between one and five years of age. Galsulfase has been shown to improve walking and stair-climbing capacity. The most common adverse reactions (‚â•10%) are: rash, pain, urticaria, pyrexia, pruritus, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dyspnea. The most common adverse reactions requiring interventions are infusion-related reactions. Galsulfase (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, recombinant human) was granted orphan drug designation by both the European Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Role in cystic fibrosis  Expression and activity of ARSB were found to be related to the function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the membrane channel deficient in cystic fibrosis. Measurements in cystic fibrosis cell line IB3 and its derivative cell line C38, which has a functional CFTR, showed increased ARSB activity and expression in the C38 line. CFTR potentiator VRT-532 increased ARSB expression and activity in cystic fibrosis cells to the level in the normal bronchial epithelial cells.  Role in malignancy  ARSB has been studied in a variety of cancers. Cultured normal mammary epithelial and myoepithelial cells had significantly higher ARSB activity than cultured malignant mammary cells. Immunohistochemistry in the colon showed decreased membrane ARSB staining in colon cancer compared to normal colon, as well as in higher grade malignancies. ARSB activity was lower in malignant than normal prostate tissue, and immunostaining of prostate tissue microarrays showed not only decreasing ARSB staining in prostate cancer tissue of a higher Gleason score, but also lower staining in patients with recurrent compared to non- recurrent cancer. ARSB staining was a greater predictor of recurrence than Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, indicating possible future role of ARSB as a prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer. Further evidence of ARSB as a tumor suppressor was determined by molecular studies in cell cultures where ARSB was silenced by siRNA. The studies showed that decrease of ARSB leads to increase in free galectin-3, which attaches more strongly to less sulfated chondroitin 4-sulfate. Galectin-3 then acts on transcription factors AP-1 to increase expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan versican and SP-1 to increase expression of WNT9A. Another mechanism by which reduced ARSB is associated with carcinogenesis is through increased binding of SHP2 to more sulfated chondroitin 4-sulfate, which leads to increased phosphorylation of p38 and MITF with subsequently increased expression of GPNMB. In melanoma cells and normal melanocytes, ARSB silencing increased invasiveness and expression of CSPG4 and MMP2, known markers of melanoma progression. CSPG4 expression was mediated by reduced binding of galectin-3 to C4S, while MMP2 expression was mediated by increased binding of SHP2 to C4S.Sumit Bhattacharyya, Leo Feferman, Kaoru Terai, Arkadiusz Z. Dudek, Joanne K. Tobacman. Decline in arylsulfatase B leads to increased invasiveness of melanoma cells. Oncotarget. 1 December 2016.  Role in metabolism  Reduced sulfate availability due to impaired activity of ARSB has been linked to increased aerobic glycolysis, as shown by an increase in NADH and NADPH, reduced oxygen consumption, increased extracellular acidification and serum lactate, and a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential in ARSB-silenced cells and ARSB-null mouse tissues.  Extra-lysosomal localization  Although primarily a lysosomal enzyme, ARSB was also found to localize at the cell membrane of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells in the liver, as well as in the apical membranes of normal and malignant colonic and prostatic epithelial cells, by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies. Membrane immunostaining in the colon and prostate was lower in malignant than in normal tissue and also was lower in higher grade malignancies. ARSB activity assay in the membrane and cytosol fractions of cultured bronchial epithelial cells showed that the activity was several-fold greater in the membrane fraction.

ASRB is responsible for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (AKA GAGs, or mucopolysaccharides). In particular, ARSB breaks down dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Because people with MPS- VI lack the ability to break down these GAGs, these chemicals build up in the lysosomes of cells. MPS-VI is therefore a type of lysosomal storage disease. Signs and symptoms Corneal clouding visible in the eye of a 30-year-old male with MPS VI Dermatan sulfate is one of the GAGs that builds up in the tissues of people with MPS-VI Unlike other MPS diseases, children with Maroteaux‚ÄìLamy syndrome usually have normal intelligence. They share many of the physical symptoms found in Hurler syndrome. Maroteaux‚ÄìLamy syndrome has a variable spectrum of severe symptoms. Neurological complications include clouded corneas, deafness, thickening of the dura (the membrane that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord), and pain caused by compressed or traumatized nerves and nerve roots. Signs are revealed early in the affected child's life, with one of the first symptoms often being a significantly prolonged age of learning how to walk. Growth begins normally, but children usually stop growing by age 8. By age 10, children often develop a shortened trunk, crouched stance, and restricted joint movement. In more severe cases, children also develop a protruding abdomen and forward-curving spine. Skeletal changes, particularly in the pelvis, are progressive and limit movement. Many children also have umbilical hernia or inguinal hernias. Nearly all children have some form of heart disease, usually involving the heart valves. Genetics This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with two working copies of the gene are unaffected. People with one working copy are genetic carriers of Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome. They have no symptoms but may pass down the defective gene to their children. People with two defective copies will suffer from MPS-VI. Diagnosis A urinalysis will show elevated levels of dermatan sulfate in the urine. A blood sample may be taken to assess the level of ASRB activity. Dermal fibroblast cells may also be examined for ASRB activity. Molecular genetic testing can give information about the specific mutation causing MPS-VI, but it is only available at specialized laboratories. Treatment The treatment of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome is symptomatic and individually tailored. A variety of specialists may be needed. In 2005, the FDA approved the orphan drug galsulfase (Naglazyme) for the treatment of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Galsulfase is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in which the missing ASRB enzyme is replaced with a recombinant version. In addition to ERT, various procedures can alleviate the symptoms of MPS-VI. Surgery may be necessary to treat abnormalities such as carpal tunnel syndrome, skeletal malformations, spinal cord compression, hip degeneration, and hernias. Some patients may need heart valve replacement. It may be necessary to remove the tonsils and/or adenoids. Severe tracheomalacia may require surgery. Physical therapy and exercise may improve joint stiffness. Hydrocephalus may be treated by the insertion of a shunt to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. A corneal transplantation can be performed for individuals with severe corneal clouding. A myringotomy, in which a small incision is made in the eardrum, may be helpful for patients with fluid accumulation in the ears. Hearing aids may be useful, and speech therapy may help children with hearing loss communicate more effectively. Certain medications can be used to treat heart abnormalities, asthma-like episodes, and chronic infections associated with MPS-VI. Anti-inflammatory medications may be of benefit. Respiratory insufficiency may require treatment with supplemental oxygen. Aggressive management of airway secretions is necessary as well. Sleep apnea may be treated with a CPAP or BPAP device. Prognosis A slowly-progressing female patient in her 20s, showing few physical abnormalities The life expectancy of individuals with MPS VI varies depending on the severity of symptoms. Without treatment, some individuals may survive through late childhood or early adolescence. People with milder forms of the disorder usually live into adulthood, although they may have reduced life expectancy. Heart disease and airway obstruction are major causes of death in people with Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Epidemiology Males and females are affected equally. Studies have shown a birth prevalence between 1 in 43,261 and 1 in 1,505,160 live births. These numbers are likely an underestimate of the true number of cases, because newborn screening for MPS- VI is not widely available. Although studies have not revealed an ethnic predisposition, certain groups with a high degree of consanguinity have a higher prevalence of MPS-VI.

They play their home games at the Estadio Pensativo. They are nicknamed Los Panzas Verdes (\\"Green bellies\\") in reference to the local avocados and as represented by the green stripes on the team uniform. History 220x220px The club was founded in 1958 by Dr. Miguel √Ångel Soto Bustamante and Mr. Antonio Mart√≠nez Barrios with the colonial city as its home. The club's first president was Rogelio Toldeo Estrada and the club's first manager was C√©sar Rodr√≠guez Gudiel. After earning promotion to the maximum division (Liga Mayor \\"A\\") in the 1957‚Äì58 season, Antigua finished third in the 1959‚Äì60 league table. However, they could not retain their level in the following years, suffering relegation after the 1964 season. After more than a decade in the Liga Mayor B, the club's administration was inherited by the Antigua Guatemala Municipality, and in December 1976, earned promotion back to the Liga Mayor \\"A\\", but were relegated two years later as the number of teams in the league was reduced from 18 to 12. Administration changed hands again and the team earned another promotion in 1979 after winning a tie- breaking third playoff match against Juca at the Estadio Mateo Flores, remaining in the top category until 1983, when a last-place finish on the standings relegated them once again. Relegation in 1983 marked the beginning of a 16-year-long period in which the club went through financial strain and was unable to return to the top flight. In 1998 the team's administration was again given to the Municipality, and on 22 May 1999 they earned a spot in the now called Liga Nacional. In 2006 they were relegated after seven years in the top flight, in what had been their longest period of participation at the top level.Guatemala 2005/06 ‚Äì RSSSF As of 2011, they have competed in the Primera Divisi√≥n de Ascenso. =Return to Liga Nacional in 2014= Antigua GFC will compete in Guatemala's highest-level league having purchased the position offered by the Heredia Jaguares from Izabal.

As a Dowager Queen, she also held the title of Duchess of Berry from 1589 until her death.  Life  =Early years= Born in Nomeny in the Duchy of Bar, Louise was the third daughter and youngest child of Nicholas of Lorraine, Duke of Merc≈ìur, and Countess Marguerite d'Egmont. She was the only surviving child of her parents; her older siblings, two sisters and one brother, died in infancy. Louise's mother died shortly before her first birthday in 1554, and her father quickly remarried in 1555 Princess Joanna of Savoy-Nemours, and gave Louise a solid classical education and introduced her to Nancy's court at the age of ten. Joanna of Savoy-Nemours died in 1568 and Louise's father contracted his third and last marriage in 1569 with Princess Catherine of Lorraine-Aumale. At the age of 20, Louise was described as a beautiful and delicate tall, blonde girl with a white complexion, light brown eyes (veiled by a slight myopia), with a slender and refined silhouette. Her upbringing reportedly resulted in her personality being quiet, dutiful and pious. =The marriage proposal of Henry III= Louise would first meet Henry in the autumn of 1573, when Henry, Duke of Anjou, was on his way to Krakow, the capital of his new kingdom, Poland-Lithuania. She attracted Henry's interest during a celebration in honor of Henry's election as King of Poland-Lithuania . Following the death of Charles IX of France, Henry of Poland-Lithuania succeeded him under the name of Henry III of France and returned clandestinely to France. Louise was with her family traveling to Reims for Henry's coronation, when Philippe Hurault de Cheverny and Michel Du Guast arrived to make Henry's marriage proposal. =Queen of France= Portrait by Jean Rabel, ca. 1575. Louise and Henry's wedding took place at the Cathedral of Reims in a ceremony celebrated by Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon two days after Henry's coronation, 15 February 1575. At the end of the month, the new Queen of France made her official entry to Paris with her husband. Described as a \\"sweet and virtuous\\" young woman, Louise reportedly immediately and deeply fell in love with her husband, a feeling that never changed, despite the difficulties, tragedies, his infidelities and finally death. Being a pious a very simple person, she is said to have suffered terribly because of the conflicts between her family (the Houses of Guise and Lorraine and in particular between her brother Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur) and her husband during the Wars of Religion. Louise and Henry III, detail of the Valois Tapestries, Florence, Uffizi Gallery. Thanks to her calm personality, Louise duly accepted her husband's eccentricities: for example, Henry III loved to dress her in elegant dresses and made her into something of a fashion doll; she readily accepted this because she was happy for his attention. Coming from a simple upbringing in the country, Louise was given Jeanne de Dampierre as Premi√®re dame d'honneur to guide her in court protocol and manners, and Louise de la B√©raudi√®re as Dame d'atour to guide her in fashion and appearance to make her a Queen consort able to meet Henry III's idea of presentation, and they were both reported to have succeeded very well with their task. The King's interest in pampering Louise was used by his enemies against him; he was called \\"Hair- dresser to his Wife\\" in a libelous pamphlet. The marriage did not produce children ‚Äî apparently Louise was pregnant at the beginning of her marriage, but had a miscarriage in May 1575; however this is an unconfirmed rumor, as no pregnancy was ever officially announced. The Queen blamed herself for this and as a result became thin, suffering bouts of depression. Between 1579 and 1586, both she and her husband made numerous pious offerings and pilgrimages, especially to Chartres and spa treatments in the hope of having an heir. As a result, the heir presumptive was (after the death of the King's brother Francis, Duke of Anjou in 1584) the controversial Henry III of Navarre, a fact which placed additional pressure upon both Louise and her husband. In 1584, there were rumors that Henry III would divorce her, but they proved to be untrue. According to Brant√¥me, Louise was at one point advised by a lady-in- waiting, that because her marriage would not result in children, it would be wise to use a different method to accomplish this (referring to another biological father), but the Queen took deep offense at this advice and refused to listen.Brant√¥me, Pierre de Bourdeille, The book of the ladies (illustrious dames) As Queen consort, Louise was given a great representational role by Henry and often in his company, participating in ceremonies, parties, and receptions at his side, and performing representational tasks, such at the opening session of the Estates General and when she placed the foundation stone to Pont Neuf with her husband on 31 May 1578. She was never involved in state affairs except in a purely ceremonial sense: she attended the Council of the King, received ambassadors in her own chambers, and officiated over the opening of parliament when it was required that she perform such tasks for ceremonial reasons, but she never used these tasks to actually participate in politics. Louise was popular among the public for her beauty and charitable personality. Due to this popularity, in 1588 she proved a moral symbolic support for the royal cause when she remained in Paris with her mother-in-law after the King had fled from the capital during his conflict with the Duke of Guise. =Queen Dowager= After the assassination of her husband by the Dominican Jacques Cl√©ment on 1 August 1589, Louise fell into a state of permanent depression and began to dress in white, the traditional mourning colour of French queens, being nicknamed the \\"White Queen\\". As a dower land, she received the Duchy of Berry during her lifetime. She was working to rehabilitate the memory of her husband, who had been excommunicated after the assassination of the Cardinal of Guise. On 6 September 1589, barely a month after the death of her husband, Louise asked Henry IV to clear her late husband's name, and on 20 January 1594, she officially demanded the rehabilitation of Henry III at a ceremony in Nantes. Louise of Lorraine's burial site at Saint-Denis. Following her husband's death and for the next 11 years, Louise lived at the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau, which she received as inheritance from her mother-in-law; she installed her room on the second floor, and she covered the walls with black. The decor was rather somber with the attributes ordinarily reserved for mourning: crosses, shovels and tips of the burial, cornucopia shedding tears. This black and silver decoration was reproduced on the curtains of the bed and the windows. But the castle being mired in debts and having not itself a huge pension, she bequeathed it to her niece Fran√ßoise of Lorraine, the only surviving child and heiress of her brother, who later married C√©sar, Duke of Vend√¥me (illegitimate son of Henri IV and Gabrielle d'Estr√©es). Louise died in the Ch√¢teau de Moulins in Moulins, Allier on 29 January 1601 and all her property was distributed or used to pay her debts. In September 1603, a papal bull ordered the construction of a Convent of Capuchins in Paris to bury her, which was done on 20 March 1608. Her remains, found in October 1805,Louise de Lorraine: une reine de France au P√®re-Lachaise - P√®re-Lachaise: 1804-1824 (in French) retrieved 07 October 2018. are located since 1817 in the royal crypt of Saint Denis Basilica.

He served as Bishop of Chester from 1708 to 1714 and then as Archbishop of York from 1714 to 1724. Politically he was a Hanoverian Tory, who favoured the Hanoverian Succession. Education Dawes was born at Lyons, near Braintree in Essex and from the age of nine attended Merchant Taylors' School in London. Already excelling in Hebrew by the age of 15, he was barely 18 when he wrote his work in verse: The Anatomy of Atheisme, and his eminent The Duties of the Closet in prose. In 1687, William matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, of which college he also became a fellow, then migrated to St Catharine's Hall, Cambridge in 1689. He graduated Master of Arts (MA Cantab) from St Catharine's in 1695, on royal decree (per lit. reg.) due to his young age; in 1696 he graduated in theology of Doctor of Divinity (DD). Anglican priest William Dawes became the permanent pastor of William III (1688‚Äì1702) and was later court pastor of Queen Anne (1702‚Äì14). From 1698, at a young age, he was Canon of Worcester Cathedral. He was Master of St Catharine's Hall, Cambridge between 1697 and 1714 and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, 1698‚Äì9. In 1698 he was appointed rector in the village of Bocking (where the rector is called Dean of Bocking) near to his estates in Essex. Here he introduced the innovative custom of taking Holy Communion not only on the three great feasts, but once every month. On 8 February 1708 he was consecrated Bishop of Chester: this was at the personal wish of Queen Anne, who overruled the advice of her ministers in appointing him. He was Archbishop of York from 1714 until his death in 1724 and a Privy Counsellor. He owed his advancement to the good will of the Queen and of his predecessor, John Sharp, who had a great regard for him, and had great influence with the Queen: it was Sharp's dying request that Dawes succeed him at York, which the Queen happily granted. He restored the Archbishop's palace in York, the Bishopthorpe. He died on 30 April 1724 from inflammation of the bowels. He was buried in the chapel of St Catharine's together with his wife. He was the most outstanding preacher of his period, a representative of the ideal of aristocratic prelate, of a high and authoritative personality. Family William Dawes was the son of John Dawes, 1st Baronet of Putney and Christian Hawkins of Bocking. According to Samuel Pepys, his parents' marriage gave rise to a good deal of gossip. His orphaned mother was an heiress, aged only sixteen, and it was claimed that her husband married her without her guardian's consent.A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies ... by John Burke After his father's death his mother remarried the noted shipbuilder Sir Anthony Deane, by whom she had eight more children.

She married into the House of La Tour d'Auvergne and was Duchess of Bouillon. Biography Born to Charles Louis de Lorraine, Count of Marsan, Prince of Mortagne, and his wife √âlisabeth de Roquelaure, she was the second of four children. Her younger brother, Gaston Jean Baptiste Charles, was the husband of Marie Louise de Rohan,Marie Louise was the only daughter of Jules, Prince de Soubise and Anne Julie de Melun and Governess of the Children of France future governess of Louis XVI and his siblings. Gaston died of Smallpox aged twenty two. Her younger brother was Camille, Prince of Marsan. She was known simply as Louise. Styled Mademoiselle de Marsan prior to her marriage, as a male line descendant of the House of Lorraine she was entitled to the style of Highness. She was a Canoness of the prestigious Remiremont Abbey in Remiremont, in the Vosges in Lorraine. Remiremont had been closely related to the Lorraine's for centuries. She was nominated as Canoness in 1733. She was engaged to Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne, only son and heir of Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne and his Polish born wife Maria Karolina Sobieska. The couple were married on 27 November 1743. Her husband, as heir to the Duchy of Bouillon, was styled prince de Turenne; as such, Louise became the Princess of Turenne. The couple's marriage was carried out by the Cardinal d'Avergne, her husband's cousin; they wed in the H√¥tel of her younger brother, Louis Camille de Lorraine. Her husband was nine years younger than she. The couple were the parents of four children, two of which survived infancy. At the death of her father in law Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne, her husband became the Duke of Bouillon. She died in at the H√¥tel de Lordat in Paris aged 69 over the night of 4‚Äì5 September 1788. The year after her death, her husband married again; to Marie Fran√ßoise Henriette de Banastre, a girl some forty-seven years younger than he and a daughter of one of his footmen. Her brother Camille, Prince of Marsan also died at the H√¥tel de Bouillon in 1780. She was buried at the √âglise Saint-Sulpice, ParisChurch of Saint- Sulpice in Paris on 9 September. At her husband's death in 1792, her son succeeded. Her son had no children and thus the House of La Tour d'Auvergne became extinct. She has no known surviving descendants; the Princes of Gu√©m√©n√© (members of the House of Rohan) claim the Duchy of Bouillon via Louise's sister in law Marie Louise de La Tour d'Auvergne who married the Prince of Gu√©m√©n√© and has descendants in modern Austria.

He is also a writer and journalist. Biography Licht was born in New Jersey in 1968. His earliest musical influences, in the 1970s, were mainstream rock bands like the Bee Gees and Wings--he remarks in an interview with Paris Transatlantic magazine that 'What made me want to play guitar was that painting of Wings in concert in the gatefold of Wings Over America. It looked so exciting... I wanted to be part of it.' Later, in school, he listened to punk and no wave bands like Mission of Burma, H√ºsker D√º and Sonic Youth. However, his musical trajectory was set when his guitar teacher gave him a copy of Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians, which would lead to his discovery of other minimalist music. Licht majored in Film Studies at Vassar College in New York. Since the 1980s, he has worked and recorded with the bands Love Child, Run On and The Pacific Ocean and with other avant-garde musicians including Jim O'Rourke, Rudolph Grey, and Loren Mazzacane Connors.

They are in charge of obtaining taxes from a tehsil with regard to land revenue. A tehsildar is also known as an Executive Magistrate of the tehsil concerned. In the revenue department, the deputy collector (also called Deputy District Collector) is usually a tehsildar who reports to the District Revenue Officer (DRO), who is also called the Additional District Collector and is the overall in-charge of the revenue department for the district. The DRO in turn reports to the District Collector (also called District Commissioner) who is in charge of overall management of the district across all departments. Deputy collectors are hired through State Service Selection Commissions, whereas DRO and District Collectors are usually Centre Civil Services employees appointed to the state cadre. The immediate subordinate of a tehsildar is known as a Naib Tehsildar. This is akin to an additional deputy commissioner. Etymology The term is assumed to be of Mughal origin, and is perhaps a union of the words \\"tehsil\\" and \\"dar\\". \\"Tehsil\\" is presumably an Arabic word meaning \\"revenue collection\\", and \\"dar\\" is a Persian word meaning \\"holder of a position\\". India =British rule= During British rule, a tehsildar was most likely a stipendiary officer of the government, employed to raise revenue. The position was called as Mamlatdar in Goa and some parts of Maharashtra. It was subsequently used by Pakistan and India following their independence from the British Empire. Tehsildar is also known as Talukdar in some states of India. In Assam, Bengal, and parts of Jharkhand, a tehsildar is known as a Mouzadar. The 17th-century composer Kancharla Gopanna was the tehsildar of Bhadrachalam. He is said to have used money from the government treasury to build Bhadrachalam Temple, and was imprisoned in a dungeon in Golconda. =Independence= Tehsildar are Class 1 gazetted officers in most states of India. In Uttar Pradesh, tehsildar are given powers of assistant collector Grade I. They also are given judicial power. They implement the various policies of the taluka and are subject to the District Collector. Officers holding the post of tehsildar preside over matters related to land, tax, and revenue. Tehsildar were first appointed as Naib Tehsildars after successful completion of a State Service Exam (i.e. UPPSC in Uttar Pradesh, HPAS in Himachal Pradesh, RAS in Rajasthan, MPPCS in Madhya Pradesh, BAS in Bihar, APPSC in Andhra Pradesh, TSPSC in Telangana, or other equivalent exams in other states of India), or promoted from a subordinate post like Kanoongo (also known as Revenue Inspectors). In Uttar Pradesh, tehsildar are promoted from Naib Tehsildar. Later on, they get promoted to the post of sub-divisional magistrate. In Goa, the mamlatdar heads the taluka revenue office. While each taluka has a mamlatdar, there are also several Joint Mamlatdars and the work is distributed among them.http://www.southgoa.nic.in/collectorate.htm Each state is divided into districts. The district's senior civil servant is the District Collector/District Magistrate, who is an officer from the IAS cadre. These districts are further subdivided into Revenue Subdivisions or Prants (West India). Each subdivision is under the charge of an officer designated as a Subdivisional Magistrate (S.D.M.) or Deputy Collector, who is a member of the State Civil Service cadre.

Early life Gilbert was the son of John Gilbert, fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, vicar of St Andrew's, Plymouth, and prebendary of Exeter, who died in 1722. He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 5 May 1713. He proceeded MA from Merton College on 1 February 1718. Career Owing to his connection with the cathedral of Exeter and his aristocratic connections, Gilbert began early to climb the ladder of preferment. On 1 August 1721 he was appointed to the chapter living of Ashburton; on 4 January 1723 he succeeded to the prebendal stall vacated by his father's death; on 4 June 1724 he was appointed subdean of Exeter, which he vacated on his installation to the deanery, on 27 December 1726; on 8 January 1724 he was granted the degree of LLD at Lambeth. In January 1726, he received from the crown a canonry at Christ Church, which he held in commendam with the bishopric of Llandaff, to which he was consecrated on 28 December 1740. In 1749, he was translated to Salisbury where he was also ex officio Chancellor of the Order of the Garter . In 1752, he succeeded Bishop Joseph Butler as Clerk of the Closet, and in 1757 the archiepiscopate of York, to which the office of Lord High Almoner was added, crowned his long series of ecclesiastical preferments. =Archbishop of York= Gilbert was mostly a place-holder archbishop. His health had begun to deteriorate prior to his appointment and he lived \\"through a pontificate of four years, when he sank under a complication of infirmities.\\"W. Dickinson Rastall, History of Southwell (1787), p. 328 Gilbert seems to have possessed few qualifications to justify his high promotion in the church. He was neither a scholar nor a theologian. Nor were these deficiencies compensated by graces of character. A friendly witness, Bishop Thomas Newton, speaks of his being regarded as \\"somewhat haughty;\\" while Horace Walpole, describes him as \\"composed of that common mixture of ignorance, meanness, and arrogance.\\" John Newton, William Cowper's friend, when seeking to obtain ordination from him, found Gilbert \\"inflexible in supporting the rules and canons of the church.\\" His imperious character is illustrated by his refusal to allow the civic mace to be carried before the mayor of Salisbury in processions within the cathedral precincts, for which he claimed a separate jurisdiction, disobedience to which, it is said, caused an unseemly personal scuffle between him and the mace-bearer. According to Newton, Gilbert was the first prelate to introduce at confirmations the practice of the bishop laying his hands on each candidate at the altar rails, and then retiring and solemnly pronouncing the prayer once for the whole number. This mode was first observed at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham; it \\"commanded attention, and raised devotion,\\" and before long became the regular manner of administering the rite. Personal life Gilbert married Margaret Sherard (sister of Philip Sherard, 2nd Earl of Harborough and daughter of Bennet Sherard of Whissendine and Dorothy, daughter of Henry Fairfax, 4th Lord Fairfax of Cameron), who predeceased him. They were the parents of: * Emma Gilbert, who married George Edgcumbe, 1st Earl of Mount Edgcumbe on 6 August 1761 at her father's house at Twickenham, three days before his death. He died at Twickenham on 9 August 1761, aged 68, and was buried in a vault in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street. =Legacy= Gilbert's only publications were occasional sermons. There are portraits of him, in the robes of the chancellor of the Order of the Garter.

The disease is caused by a defect in an enzyme known as aspartylglucosaminidase. This enzyme plays a significant role in our bodies because it aids in breaking down certain sugars (for example, oligosaccharides) that are attached to specific proteins (for example, glycoproteins). Aspartylglucosaminuria itself is characterized as a lysosomal disease because it does deal with inadequate activity in an enzyme's function. Aspartylglucosaminidase functions to break down glycoproteins. These proteins are most abundant in the tissues of the body and in the surfaces of major organs, such as the liver, spleen, thyroid and nerves. When glycoproteins are not broken down, aspartylglucosaminidase backs up in the lysosomes along with other substances. This backup causes progressive damage to the tissues and organs. Signs and symptoms At birth, there is no sign that a child will develop symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria. Typically, signs and symptoms become apparent between two and four years of age and become progressively worse as the individual ages. The following signs and symptoms may appear: * Individuals are more prone to respiratory infections * Development of scoliosis * Seizures or difficulty with movement * Skin and joints may become loose * Facial features change progressively; this may include: ::::# thickening of the skin ::::# features becoming more prominent ::::# large head ::::# broad lower jaw ::::# short, broad nose ::::# rounded cheeks * Progression of developmental and mental disabilities, including: ::::# progressive loss of speech ::::# decrease in mental functioning ::::# before school age, concentration lowers ::::# development continues, but becomes slower than usual * An intellectual peak occurs in the mid-teens and allows a plateau for the disease. Once an individual hits the age of 25-30 the decrease begins again, including: ::::# learned skills become lost which result in severe learning disabilities ::::# motor skills deteriorate ::::# individuals become less mobile and more dependent (Children are physically uncoordinated, but remain able to play sports and do everyday activities until they reach adulthood.) * During the first year of life inguinal and umbilical hernias are common. * Less severe symptoms include: ::::# enlargement of the spleen and liver ::::# diarrhea * People with aspartylglucosaminuria may have lower than average height, because they tend to go through puberty earlier. * Epilepsy may develop in adulthood. * Finnish studies have shown that life expectancy is shorter than average. Genetics Aspartylglucosaminuria is a genetic condition that is inherited from both parents. The AGU patient is born with two copies of the mutated AGA gene. One copy comes from the mother‚Äôs egg and the other copy comes from the father‚Äôs sperm. In order to develop aspartylglucosaminuria, the individual must inherit changes in both of his AGU genes (autonomic recessive inheritance). When a person receives one changed form of the gene AGU from one of the parents, the individual is then classified as a carrier. Diagnosis In order to be diagnosed with AGU an individual takes a urine test, which will show indication of an increased amount of aspartylglucosamin being secreted. The confirmation of the diagnosis of aspartylglucosaminuria requires a blood test. This helps show if the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase is present or partially absent. A skin simple will also show the amount of aspartylglucosaminidase present. =Pre-natal diagnosis= When families have a child who has already been diagnosed with AGU, they have the option to observe the enzyme's activity that codes for AGU in future pregnancy, to help determine if the next child will also have a positive diagnosis for aspartylglucosaminuria. Treatment No treatment is available to cure or slow down the progression of aspartylglucosaminuria. Bone marrow transplants have been conducted in hope that the bone marrow will produce the missing enzyme. The results of the tests thus far have shown to be inconclusive. =Preventions/interventions to signs and symptoms= Since ear infections and respiratory infections are common for children diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria, it is best to have regular checkups for both the ears and the respiratory tract. Extreme sensitivity to the sun‚Äôs rays may develop; the best way to protect an individual diagnosed with aspartylglucosaminuria is to have them wear sunglasses, hats or caps to protect their eyes. Epilepsy and insomnia can both be treated with medication. It will be beneficial to children who are diagnosed with AGU to receive an education from a school with special teaching. =Habilitation= The process of habilitation for individuals diagnosed with AGU needs to be established in their early stages of life. The team for habilitation should include professionals who are experienced in disabilities and the effects that having a disability can have on everyday life. Habilitation will include assessments, assistance with the choice of aids, and information concerning disabilities and counseling. Prognosis Individuals with AGU typically have normal development in infancy. Around the age of 2‚Äì4 years, they begin showing signs of developmental delay, but development is still progressing. Initial symptoms may present as clumsiness and/or speech delay. Individuals with AGU also show increased upper respiratory infections. Development continues until about puberty; however, an individual at 13‚Äì16 years of age typically shows mental and motor development similar to a 5-6 year old. Around puberty, a gradual decline in mental abilities and motor skills occurs. This progressive decline continues until about age 25‚Äì28, when rapid impairment of abilities occurs, resulting in severe intellectual disability. Epidemiology Aspartylglucosaminuria is estimated to affect 1 in 18,500 people in Finland. This condition is less common in other countries, but the incidence is unknown. Even though this disease can occur in various races and ethnicities, another study backed this finding up by stating that 1 in 26,000 people in Finland had the disease and that 1 in 18,000 were carriers. After trisomy 21 and fragile X syndrome, this is the most frequent multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability syndrome in Finland.

The comune was formed on March 30, 2003, by the fusion of the former comuni of Sant'Abbondio and Santa Maria Rezzonico.  Geography  The comune of San Siro incorporates the frazioni (municipal fractions) of Acquaseria, Camnasco, Carcente, Gallio, La Torre, Lancio Lucena, Marena, Mastena, Maso, Molvedo, Noledo, Pezzo, Rezzonico, Roncate, Santa Maria, San Martino, Soriano and Trecciano. San Siro borders the following municipalities: Cremia, Menaggio, Plesio; and, on the other side of the lake in the Province of Lecco: Bellano, Dervio and Perledo.  Etymology  The etymology of Rezzonico has different hypotheses. One theory suggests that it derives from the Rhaetic people, an Alpine tribe from Northeast Italy and the area which today comprises Switzerland and Tyrol, Austria; another that the term derived from an Etruscan general, Rhaeto, who supposedly lived around the area; and ultimately, that the name may derive from risculada, a term local to the town which describes its type of cobblestone paving.http://212.78.2.155/c013248/zf/index.php/servizi- aggiuntivi/index/index/idtesto/25  History  The origins of the settlement of Rezzonico are also debated. It may have been founded by the Orobii, a Celtic tribe which was settled in the areas around Como, Lecco and Bergamo, between the River Ticino and Oglio; there may have been an Etruscan origin of the settlement too; or it may have been founded by other Gaulish tribes, possibly even the Senones. All these hypotheses are possible due to traces of each of these peoples having been found in the nearby areas. What is certain is the existence of a Roman settlement in the area, as testified by Livy himself. There are other pieces of evidence in regards to the settlement's Roman period; such include two tablets inscribed in Latin (which are now held in Menaggio and Milan) and the remnants of a wall which dates to this era. Sights include the Rezzonico Castle, the 15th century church of Santa Maria and the Villa Gaeta, designed in 1920 by the studio of Gino Copped√®.

Biography Born in New York City and brought up in Britain, he was the son of British actor/manager George Osmond Tearle (1852‚Äì1901) and American actress Marianne \\"Minnie\\" Conway (1852-1896),Ancestry.ca: Marianne \\"Minnie\\" ConwayMarianne Tearle; socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu the brother of actor Malcolm Tearle, and the half-brother of silent film star Conway Tearle. His maternal grandmother was Sarah Crocker Conway. In 1893, he made his stage debut as young Prince Richard, Duke of York, in his father's production of Richard III and in 1908 he appeared in his first film as Romeo in Romeo and Juliet. He became a Shakespearean actor of note, appearing on stage in the title roles of Othello, Macbeth and Henry V. His theatrical career was interrupted when he joined the Royal Artillery for a four-year stint beginning in 1915. In 1924 he starred in the West End production of Frederick Lonsdale's drama The Fake. In 1935 he appeared in Bernard Merivale's The Unguarded Hour. One of Tearle's most memorable screen roles was in Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935), in which he portrayed Professor Jordan, a seemingly respectable country squire whose missing finger unmasks him as an enemy agent. He was cast as an RAF gunner in One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942), a German General in Undercover (film) (1943), an aging First World War veteran in Medal for the General (1944) and as Franklin D. Roosevelt in The Beginning or the End, MGM's 1946 account of the Manhattan Project. Tearle made his Broadway theatre debut in Carnival in 1919. In his review in the New York Times, Alexander Woollcott noted, \\"It is difficult to guess why Godfrey Tearle should have selected as the vehicle of his American debut the play called Carnival, which was presented to New York for the first time last evening at the 44th Street Theatre. It is a spare and unsubstantial piece at best, and the role it offers him is distinctly secondary in importance and opportunity.\\"New York Times review of Carnival, 25 December 1919 Additional Broadway credits include The Fake (1924), The Flashing Stream (1939), and Antony and Cleopatra (1947). Knighthood Tearle was knighted in the 1951 King's Birthday Honours List for services to drama. Marriages He was married three times, to actress Mary Malone from 1909 until their divorce in 1932, to starlet Stella Freeman from 1932 until her sudden death in 1936, and to Barbara Palmer from 1937 until their divorce in 1947. For several years at the end of his life, Tearle lived with the actress Jill Bennett. Death Sir Godfrey Tearle died on 9 June 1953, aged 68.

Origins and birth Hay was the second son of George Hay, Viscount Dupplin (who succeeded his father as eighth Earl of Kinnoull, in 1719), and Abigail, the youngest daughter of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, Lord High Treasurer. He was born in London on 10 November 1711. His birth was mentioned by Jonathan Swift in the Letters to Stella, and his infancy is thus referred to by Richard Bentley in the dedication of his edition of Horace to Lord Oxford, on 8 December 1711: Parvulos duos ex filia nepotes, quorum alter a matre adhuc rubet. (\\"Two small grandsons from his daughter, of whom one is still red from his mother\\"). Education At age 6, he was brought by Matthew Prior to Westminster School, of which Robert Freind was then head-master. There he was admired, \\"for his talents, and beloved for the pleasantry of his manners, and forming many valuable friendships among his schoolfellows.\\" While still a boy at Westminster he acted in the play Julius Caesar before an audience including George II and Queen Caroline. His continuation of his part even when his plume of ostrich feathers caught fire attracted the notice of the queen, who continued his warm patroness till her death in 1737. From Westminster he moved to Christ Church, Oxford. Having after receiving his BA degree on 25 November 1731, he joined his cousin, Thomas, duke of Leeds, in the Grand Tour. When he came home afterwards in 1735 his uncle not only commented that he was not only 'untainted, but much improved'. He had been originally destined for the army, but on his return to England he went back to Christ Church and took his MA degree 13 June 1735. He then read divinity with a view to his entrance into holy orders. Royal favour In the year of his ordination, he was presented by his uncle to the family living of Bothal, Northumberland, and by the influence of Queen Caroline, appointed to a royal chaplaincy at only 25. In 1739, as heir of his great-grandfather, William Drummond, 1st Viscount Strathallan, who had entailed a portion of his Perthshire estates to form a provision for the second son of the Kinnoull family, he assumed the name and arms of Drummond. As royal chaplain, he gained the confidence and esteem of George II, whom he attended during the German campaign of 1743, and on 7 July of that year preached the thanksgiving sermon for the victory of Dettingen before the king at Hanau. On his return to England he entered on a prebendal stall at Westminster, to which he had been appointed by his royal patron in the preceding April. On 9 June 1745, he was admitted BD and DD at Oxford. Bishop of St Asaph Drummond was consecrated Bishop of St Asaph in Kensington Church on 24 April 1748. The 13 years spent by him in this see were among the happiest of his life. He was deservedly respected, and he \\"constantly mentioned the diocese with peculiar affection and delight.\\" He would seem to have dispensed the large patronage of the see with sound judgement. He was not, however, in advance of his age. He made no attempt to popularise the church among the Welsh-speaking population of the diocese, and publicly expressed his hope \\"that people would see it their best interest to enlarge their views and notions, and to unite with the rest of their fellow-subjects in language as well as in government.\\" Archbishop of York In 1761, Drummond was translated to Salisbury where he was ex officio also Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. Here, however, he remained only a few months. He was elected to Salisbury in June; the following August the diocese of York became vacant by the death of Archbishop Gilbert, and Drummond was at once chosen as his successor. \\"Previous to the coronation,\\" writes Horace Walpole, \\"the vacant bishoprics were bestowed. York was given to Drummond, a man of parts and of the world,\\" and \\"a dignified and accomplished prelate.\\" His election took place on 3 October, and his confirmation on 23 October. As a proof of the high esteem in which he was held and of his reputation as a preacher, he was selected while archbishop-designate to preach the sermon at the coronation of George III and Queen Charlotte, on 22 September 1761. This sermon was pronounced by contemporary critics as \\"sensible and spirited\\" and \\"free from fulsome panegyrick.\\" The style is dignified and the language well chosen, and the relative duties of monarch and subjects are set forth without flattery and without compromise. Political influence Drummond now became Lord High Almoner to the young king. He is stated to have reformed many abuses connected with the office, and to have put a stop to the system by which persons of rank and wealth had been accustomed to make use of the royal bounty to secure a provision for persons having private claims upon them. During the life of George II, Drummond, who was a whig and an adherent of the Duke of Newcastle, exercised considerable political power, and was an influential speaker in the House of Lords. As Archbishop of York he was sworn of the privy council ex officio on 7 November 1761. In 1753, when a charge was laid before the privy council against James Johnson, Bishop of Gloucester, together with Mr Stone and William Murray, afterwards Lord Mansfield, of having drunk the Pretender's health, he defended his old schoolfellows with so much earnestness and eloquence that he secured their acquittal, and the proposed inquiry was negatived in the House of Lords by a large majority, George II remarking that \\"he was indeed a man to make a friend of.\\" Retirement and family life The change of policy which speedily followed the accession of George III, when indignities were heaped upon the leading members of the old Whig party, aroused the indignation and disgust of the archbishop. Except when his duty as a churchman called for it, he ceased his attendance at the House of Lords, and retiring to his own private mansion of Brodsworth Hall in Yorkshire, of which we are told he 'made an elegant retreat,' he devoted himself to the vigorous oversight of his diocese and the education of his children, which he personally superintended. In 1749, he married Henrietta, daughter of Peter Auriol, a merchant of London, by whom he had a daughter followed by six sons. He instructed his children himself. History, of which he had an extensive and accurate knowledge, was his favourite subject, and his son gratefully records 'the perspicuous and engaging manner' in which he imparted his instruction, and the lucidity with which he traced the continuity and connection of all history, sacred and profane, 'with the zeal and fervour of honest conviction.' For the use of his children he drew up some clear and comprehensive chronological tables. Reputation As a bishop he was certainly quite on a level with the standard of his age. A somewhat extensive collection of his letters existing in manuscript proves him to have been a good, sensible, practical man of business. In his religious views he was strongly opposed to Calvinism, and did not scruple to express freely his dislike of passages in the Articles and Homilies which appeared to favour those tenets. He fully shared in the suspicion which in that age of formality attached to the term \\"enthusiasm,\\" which he vehemently denounced, while he was equally ardent in defence of what he styled \\"the decent services and rational doctrines of the church of England.\\" Noble manners, an engaging disposition, affable and condescending address, a genial and good-humoured bearing, even if some allowance is made for partiality in description, make up an attractive portrait. His hospitality was generous, even to excess, and if the gossip of the day is to be credited his own example did not place any severe restraint on the clergy who gathered round his table. On his death Horace Walpole speaks of him as \\"a sensible, worldly man, but much addicted to his bottle.\\" His son more guardedly records that \\"wherever he lived hospitality presided; wherever he was present elegance, festivity, and good humour were sure to be found.\\" His very failings were those of a \\"heart warm even to impetuosity.\\" His open- handed, generous character was manifested in the splendid additions he made to the archiepiscopal palace at Bishopthorpe, where he also erected a new gateway, ornamented the chapel at great cost, and rebuilt the parish church in the taste of the day. It deserves notice that, in an age when the fine arts suffered from prevalent neglect, the archbishop proved himself a liberal patron of English artists. Writings Six of the archbishop's sermons which had been printed separately at the time of their delivery were collected by his youngest son, the Revd George Hay Drummond, and published in one volume in 1803, together with a short memoir and A Letter on Theological Study. These sermons display clearness of thought and force of expression, the matter is sensible and to the point, the composition is good, and the language dignified. The Letter on Theological Study was written to a young friend, and not intended for publication. The advice as to the selection of books is very sensible, and free from narrowness,wide reading being recommended, including works not strictly theological. Death and posterity In 1766, he lost his eldest daughter at the age of 16, and in 1773, his wife died. He never recovered this last blow, and died at Bishopthorpe on 10 December 1776. By his own desire he was buried under the altar of the parish church, with as little pomp as possible. Of his five sons the eldest, Robert Auriol, succeeded his uncle, Thomas Hay, as 10th earl of Kinnoull, 1787. A portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was engraved by Watson. A small medallion portrait is prefixed to his sermons.

Life Musgrave was the son of W. Peet Musgrave, a wealthy tailor and woollen-draper of Cambridge, and Sarah his wife. He was born in Slaughter House Lane on 30 March 1788, and baptised at the parish church of Great St. Mary's on 25 April. He and his two brothers - the elder of whom, Charles Musgrave, became eventually archdeacon of Craven - were educated at Richmond Grammar School, then at the zenith of its reputation under Dr Tate. In 1804 he was admitted as a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1807 was elected scholar. In 1810 he graduated B.A. as fourteenth wrangler, when William Henry Maule was senior wrangler, and Thomas Shaw Brandreth second. In 1811, he was members' prizeman and in 1813 he took his M.A.. Musgrave was elected junior fellow in 1812, and senior fellow in 1832. In 1821, though his knowledge of eastern tongues was by no means profound, he was appointed Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic. He was Senior Proctor in 1831. He took holy orders, and filled in succession the college livings of Over (1823), St. Mary's, Cambridge (1825‚Äì1833), and Bottisham (1837). He became senior bursar of his college in 1825, and during a long tenure of the office, only resigning it when he left Cambridge in 1837, his sound judgment and practical knowledge of business proved of great service. He was also an active and judicious county magistrate. In politics, he was a decided liberal, but \\"without any admixture of party spirit\\". He was a warm advocate for the relaxation of all religious tests on admission to university degrees. The petition which in March 1834 was presented to both Houses of Parliament with that object, lay at his rooms for signature. In May 1834, the pressure put upon Connop Thirlwall, afterwards Bishop of St. David's, by the Master, Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, which led Thirlwall to resign his tutorship, excited Musgrave's indignation. He and Sedgwick drew up a paper addressed to the Master, which was signed by George Peacock, afterwards Dean of Ely, Romilly, and others, calling upon him to summon a meeting of the seniority to take the matter into consideration. Musgrave's university distinction and liberal politics marked him out for preferment from the Whig government. His first senior Church of England appointment was when he was installed Dean of Bristol on 13 or 14 May 1837., Bristol, Gloucester, Oxford and Peterborough Dioceses: Deans of Bristol, pp. 15‚Äì19. Three months later, he was nominated Bishop of Hereford by the Crown on 5 August and consecrated on 1 October 1837,, Handbook of British Chronology, p. 252. by Archbishop Howley at Lambeth. At Hereford, he revived the office of rural dean, and was instrumental in setting up the Diocesan Church Building Society. On the death of Archbishop Edward Harcourt in 1847, he was translated to the archbishopric of York on 10 December 1847., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 283., York Diocese: Archbishops of York, pp. 1‚Äì5. His enthronement took place in York Minster on 15 January 1848. Musgrave died on 4 May 1860, aged 72. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), was a US Supreme Court decision that a regulation enacted under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 196442 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 2000-d to 2000d-7. did not include a private right of action to allow private lawsuits based on evidence of disparate impact..  Background  In 1990, Alabama added an amendment to its state constitution to make English the state's official language. Thereafter, James Alexander, Director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety, ordered that the test for Alabama driver's license test to be given only in English. Plaintiff Martha Sandoval sued Alexander and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama and claimed that the English-only test policy was discriminatory. Sandoval sued under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Two sections of Title VI would prove important to her lawsuit. The first was section 601, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of \\"race, color, or national origin\\" by programs or agencies that receive federal funding, such as the Alabama Department of Public Safety.. The other was section 602, which authorizes federal agencies \\"to effectuate the provisions of [section 601]... by issuing rules, regulations or orders of general applicability.\\". In her lawsuit, Sandoval invoked a regulation that the US Department of Justice had promulgated under section 602. The regulation prohibited agencies and programs receiving federal funding from taking actions that had a disparate impact on persons of a certain race, color, or nationality.28 C.F.R. ¬ß 42.104(b)(2) (2000). She sought to enjoin Alabama's policy of giving the tests for driver's licenses in English only. She argued that the policy had a disparate impact on those born outside the United States because it denied non-English-speakers, who are disproportionately born outside the US, the opportunity to obtain driver's licenses.See The state defendants, however, argued that the regulation under which Sandoval was suing them did not include what is called an \\"implied private right of action,\\" a cause of action not expressly created by a statute or regulation but one that a court has interpreted the statute or regulation to create implicitly. The district court agreed with Sandoval that she had a private right of action and agreed that Alabama's policy was discriminatory under Title VI. The court therefore enjoined the policy. The state defendants then appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. It first held that the regulation under which Sandoval sued allowed a private litigant to enforce its provisions and then affirmed the district court's ruling on the merits. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on \\"only the question [of] whether there [was] a private cause of action to enforce the regulation.\\"Alexander, 532 U.S. at 279.  Decision  The Court's opinion, written by Justice Scalia, began by describing the assumptions under which the Court would decide the case. First of all, \\"it is clear\\" that section 601 of title VI contained an implied private right of action. The Court held that Cannon v. University of Chicago was controlling. Cannon held that Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is identical to Title VI but applies to gender-based discrimination, contained an implied private right of action.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 280 (\\"The reasoning of [Cannon] embraced the existence of a private right to enforce Title VI as well [as Title IX].\\"). Under Cannon, section 601 of Title VI also contained a private right of action. Then, the Court noted that \\"it is beyond dispute\\" and that \\"no party disagrees\\" that section 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination but does not prohibit activities with a disparate impact on certain races, colors, or nationalities.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 280. Finally, the Court said it would assume for purposes of deciding the case that regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI may validly prohibit actions that have a disparate impact on certain races, colors, or national origins.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 281. The Court then turned to the question that was at issue in the case: whether the disparate-impact regulation that Sandoval invoked created an implied private right of action. The Court rejected the argument, put forward both by Sandoval and by Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion, that because Cannon involved disparate impact, Cannon held that Title IX and, by extension Title VI, create a private right of action to enjoin policies that create a disparate impact. Both Sandoval and Justice Stevens relied on a footnote in Cannon, which stated that the effect of the policies that the Cannon plaintiff challenged was \\"to exclude women from consideration.\\"The disputed footnote from Cannon reads in pertinent part: 441 U.S. at 680 n.2. The Court responded that Cannon was decided on the assumption that the University of Chicago had engaged in intentional discrimination, and hence the holding of case applied only to intentional discrimination. The Court asserted that \\"this Court is bound by holdings, not language.\\"Alexander, 532 U.S. at 282. Therefore, from the majority's point of view, the holding of Cannon did not include the footnote. The Court also rejected the argument that Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission, a case the Court decided in 1983, dictated the outcome of Sandoval. The Court noted that although five Justices in Guardians had agreed that disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI were valid, a majority of the Justices had not decided that those regulations were enforceable by private plaintiffs.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 283. The Court then examined section 602, the section of Title VI under which the disparate-impact regulation was promulgated, to determine whether it created an implied private right of action. It began by noting that certain \\"rights-creating\\" language that was present in section 601 and Cannon relied on for its holding, was absent from section 602.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 288-89. The Court pointed out that section 602, by specifying that the federal government could cut off funding to a program which violated regulations, expressly provided for \\"one method of enforcing\\" those regulations.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 289-90. It concluded that this \\"express provision of one method\\" of enforcement \\"suggests that Congress intended to preclude others,\\" such as a private right of action.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 290. It, therefore, held that Sandoval had no private right of action under the disparate-impact regulation.  Dissent  In his dissent, Justice Stevens explained the Cannon decision as follows: > In providing a shorthand description of her claim in the text of the > opinion, we ambiguously stated that she had alleged that she was denied > admission \\"because she is a woman,\\" but we appended a lengthy footnote > setting forth the details of her disparate impact claim. Other than the > shorthand description of her claim, there is not a word in the text of the > opinion even suggesting that she had made the improbable allegation that the > University of Chicago and Northwestern University had intentionally > discriminated against women. In the context of the entire opinion (including > both its analysis and its uncontested description of the facts of the case), > that single ambiguous phrase provides no basis for limiting the case‚Äôs > holding to incidents of intentional discrimination. If anything, the fact > that the phrase \\"because she is a woman\\" encompasses both intentional and > disparate impact claims should have made it clear that the reasoning in the > opinion was equally applicable to both types of claims. In any event, the > holding of the case certainly applied to the disparate impact claim that was > described in detail in footnote 1 of the opinion.Alexander, 532 U.S. at 298 > (Stevens, J., dissenting). His response to the majority's account of the relation between sections 601 and 602 was as follows: > Beyond its flawed structural analysis of Title VI and an evident antipathy > toward implied rights of action, the majority offers little affirmative > support for its conclusion that Congress did not intend to create a private > remedy for violations of the Title VI regulations. The Court offers > essentially two reasons for its position. First, it attaches significance to > the fact that the \\"rights-creating\\" language in ¬ß 601 that defines the > classes protected by the statute is not repeated in ¬ß 602. But, of course, > there was no reason to put that language in ¬ß 602 because it is perfectly > obvious that the regulations authorized by ¬ß 602 must be designed to protect > precisely the same people protected by ¬ß 601. Moreover, it is self-evident > that, linguistic niceties notwithstanding, any statutory provision whose > stated purpose is to ‚Äúeffectuate‚Äù the eradication of racial and ethnic > discrimination has as its \\"focus\\" those individuals who, absent such > legislation, would be subject to discrimination. Second, the Court repeats > the argument advanced and rejected in Cannon that the express provision of a > fund cut-off remedy \\"suggests that Congress intended to preclude > others.\\"Alexander, 532 U.S. at 315-16 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

He served five years in the Indian Army rising to the rank of lieutenant and resigning on grounds of ill health. In 1852, he enrolled at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he received a degree in mathematics four years later; he was made a deacon that year (1856) in London, and served in the Church of England thereafter; he was ordained priest in 1857. In 1869, he was Rector at Newington, and in 1875, he was Vicar of St Mary Abbots, Kensington; both parishes being in London. During this period, he composed several hymns. On 24 June 1878, he became Bishop of Lichfield, in the same year that he made a prestigious second marriage. Bishop of Lichfield (1878‚Äì1891) He was consecrated a bishop by Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the Feast of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist 1878 (24 June) at St Paul's Cathedral. Archbishop of York (1891‚Äì1908) In 1891 (possibly 28 July 1891), he was translated Archbishop of York, which position he held for the next seventeen years. He was appointed to the Privy Council after the accession of King Edward VII 24 January 1901.Gazette Website: PDF Navigator at www.londongazette.co.uk He made a private visit to Russia in 1897The Church of England during the Second World War by Dianne Kirby at www.history.ac.uk andZWT May 1897 at webcache.googleusercontent.com in the same year, he tried to create two new bishoprics, one in Sheffield. To do this, the Archbishop was prepared to surrender two thousand pounds of his considerable income ‚Äì one thousand pounds for each new diocese, but the project still came to nothing. Maclagan complained that from 1891, he had been more Bishop than Archbishop owing to the large population and territory of the diocese. In 1906, he revived the idea, specifically naming Sheffield and Hull as the preferred seats for the new dioceses. By the end of his tenure, there were still only nine dioceses in the province. Sheffield did not get its own Bishop until 1914. Maclagan was apparently a strong High Churchman, but his private beliefs had to be subsumed often. In 1899, he sat assessor with his ecclesiastical superior Frederick Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1902), when the decision was given against the use of incense and other ritualistic practices, and was obliged loyally to uphold the primate's opinion. Maclagan resigned his office in 1908, possibly on grounds of ill health. Archbishop Maclagan died in London on 19 September 1910, and was survived by his second wife Augusta (1826‚Äì1915). Family Maclagan was twice married. His first wife was Sarah Kate Clapham (1836‚Äì1864), whom he married in 1860 at the age of 34. By her he had two sons, Cyril and Walter. He was married secondly on 12 November 1878 to the Honourable Augusta Anne Barrington (1836‚Äì1915), a daughter of the daughter of the William Barrington, 6th Viscount Barrington.http://groups.google.com/group/alt.obituaries/browse_thread/thread/a4e73f8cbdc6a0cc/19c79d7f4fd05967?lnk=st&q;=Maclagan+Lascelles&rnum;=1&hl;=en#19c79d7f4fd05967 (Augusta Maclagan had money settled upon her when she married Maclagan, then Bishop of Lichfield, in 1878; for the sources of this money and how it was invested, see this paper.That wide-eyed sceptical curiosity that makes women so formidable at webcache.googleusercontent.com About half her money was settled upon her son Eric when he married in 1913.

By marriage, one part descended to the Southworths of Samlesbury, who held it until the 16th century. This portion was later owned by Gerards, Ainsworths, Banastres, Baguley and Parker families. The other part was held by the Hollands until they forfeited it in 1461, when it was granted to Lord Stanley and his son, Lord Strange, the Earls of Derby. =Industry= In the township there was a quarry and several collieries, including one accessing a seam of coal thick. There were handloom weavers producing quilts and counterpanes. Two cotton mills and a bleachworks were built.

The coach service from Namsos to Trondheim is part of NOR-WAY Bussekspress. The company was founded in 1920 as the county-owned Fylkesbilene i Nord-Tr√∏ndelag (FBNT), when the county took over four bus companies. In 1998, the company changed its name and was converted to a limited company. The following year, the county council sold a majority share.

In 2008, the company had a revenue of and an income of NOK 2 million. History =Predecessors= The first bus service in Nord- Tr√∏ndelag opened on 25 July 1908, when Stenkj√¶r og Namsos Automobilselskap started a service from Steinkjer to R√∏dhammeren. The route started at Steinkjer Station, where it connected to the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line that had opened three years earlier, and ran to the south shore of the river Namsen, where a ferry took passengers to Namsos. The company bought two seven-seat Rex Simplex cars, that made the route in two and a half hours. The line was the second in Norway and the first to also carry post.Erlandsen, 1995: 12‚Äì13 The next bus company to start in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag was Namdalen Automobilselskap. In June 1913, it started a route from Namsos to Fiskum, using a seven-seat Labuire. The route was later the same year extended to Brekkvasselv. The following year, the route was further extended to Gjersvika. By 1920, the company had six cars.Erlandsen, 1995: 19‚Äì21 In Verdal, John Fiske started a route from Verdals√∏ra and Verdal Station on the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line, to Sandvika, adjacent the Swedish border. Fiske bought two Dodge cars, that were still in service in 1920.Erlandsen, 1995: 21 Inder√∏y Automobillag was founded in 1917, and operated a route from R√∏ra Station on the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line via Straumen to Ut√∏y.Erlandsen, 1995: 21‚Äì22 =Establishment= The idea to have a county- owned bus company was launched by engineer Emil Astrup, who was head of the Public Roads Administration in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag. He wrote a letter in 1918, where he stated that it would be more operationally efficient and easier to coordinate traffic if the bus routes in the county were merged into a single entity that was controlled by a political body. He also wanted to introduce cross subsidies, where profitable routes on main roads would pay the losses suffered on marginal routes in less populated areas. Negotiations with the four incumbent operators started in 1920, and agreements were made whereby the county would purchase them for . The money was borrowed as county-guaranteed bonds. The purchase gave Fylkesbilene 18 cars.Erlandsen, 1995: 29‚Äì41 Fylkesbilene i Nord-Tr√∏ndelag was established as a county agency, with County Governor Halvor Bachke Guldahl as the first chair. The board was identical to the County Road Board.Erlandsen, 1995: 35 In addition to the existing routes, the company established new routes from Steinkjer to Ogndal, from Steinkjer to Kvam, from Verdals√∏ra to Grunnan, from Namsos to Nordli and from Namsos via H√∏ylandet to Kongsmo. The routes were largely planned to supplement the railway line, that would operate as the main artery north‚Äìsouth through Innherred.Erlandsen, 1995: 44 The company also took over the operation of the ferry from R√∏dhammeren to Namsos. It took over the ferry Oma that had been in service since 1912. Oma was 28.13 tonnes and had a capacity for 50 passengers. It was replaced by the 100-passenger Kaulgarden in 1921, that was in service until 1924, when a bridge was opened. This was the only ferry service operated by Fylkesbilene.Erlandsen, 1995: 29 =Pre-war operations= The first year of operation showed 21,000 passengers and a profit of NOK 41,000. During 1920, there was a strike in the Norwegian State Railways, and Fylkesbilene had to operate a post car on the route from Trondheim via Steinkjer to Sunnan. The company's first head office was at Grand Hotell in Steinkjer, a block away from the railway station. In 1929, the Nordland Line opened from Sunnan via Sn√•sa to Grong, and the bus route was terminated. In 1928, the company bought its first buses, a series of 16 and 22-seat vehicles from Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted. Studebakers were introduced in 1937 and Volvos in 1938. A bus terminal and offices were built in the center of Steinkjer in 1938.Erlandsen, 1995: 47‚Äì58 In 1938, the route from Steinkjer to Follafoss and from Steinkjer to Sandvollan, Kjerknesv√•gen and Ut√∏y were opened.Erlandsen, 1995: 136 At the break-out of World War II in Norway on 9 April 1940, all the company's buses were taken over by the armed forces. From 17 May, the buses were returned to the company, but quotas for petrol were introduced, and the company was forced to install wood gasifiers on its fleet. Both Steinkjer and Namsos were bombed in 1940, but in both towns the company's facilities survived, except the garage in Steinkjer. The buses were at the time spread around the county, and only a single bus was destroyed.Erlandsen, 1995: 65‚Äì67 After the war ended in 1945, the company had 21 operational buses. The company needed to have a license to purchase buses, and in the following five years, 17 buses were bought for about NOK 1 million. They were mostly Volvos and Scania-Vabis, including one from the municipal bus company in H√∏ylandet. In 1946, Fylkesbilene bought Kvam Billag and the routes from Steinkjer to √òvre Kvam. At the same time, the route to Follafoss was extended to the county border. From 1 January 1948, Fylkesbilene bought the private bus operators in Ytre Namdal, and started routes from Vikna, N√¶r√∏y, Leka and Bindal via Otters√∏y to Namsos. The company in H√∏ylandet was bought to allow direct connection from Ytre Namdal via H√∏ylandet to Grong. The same year, the company introduced a direct service between Verdals√∏ra and Levanger, that previously had only been served by the railway.Erlandsen, 1995: 81‚Äì83 =Post-war operations= A Tr√∏nderBilene bus pained in the old brown scheme On 16 December 1948, the snowmobile route from Steinfjellet to Gjersvika was opened. Within two weeks, additional routes were introduced from Brekkvasselv to Gjersvika and over Lifjellet. The company had four Bombardier vehicles for the routes. The routes were terminated in the early in 1960s, when proper roads were built.Erlandsen, 1995: 83‚Äì86 A new bus station opened in Namsos in 1953, with the city receiving a new garage three years later. Routes from Steinkjer to Stod were started in 1961, after Fylkesbilene bought √òstg√•rds, and the following year from Steinkjer to Vingsand.Erlandsen, 1995: 101 From 1964, the board was no longer identical to the County Road Board, but was instead directly appointed by the county council. In 1965, Fylkesbilene attempted an airport coach service from Steinkjer and Levanger to Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes, but failed to make money and terminted it the same year.Erlandsen, 1995: 94 The same year, the company established a route from Vanvikan via Leksvik to Mosvik and onwards to Steinkjer. From 1 January 1967, the company took over the route Vanvikan‚ÄìKr√•kmo and started a direct service from Leksvik to Trondheim.Erlandsen, 1995: 97‚Äì98 In 1966, the first town buses were introduced in Namsos, in 1967, a direct route from Namsos via Foldereid to R√∏rvik was introduced, and on 1 February 1968, the company took over Olav H√•rberg's route from Namsos to Kjerstivika. From 1 July 1969, a combined bus and cargo route was established from Namsos to S√∏rli.Erlandsen, 1995: 108‚Äì109 The company's main depot was opened on 25 November 1969 outside Steinkjer, and cost NOK 2 million.Erlandsen, 1995: 99 In 1972, the company opened a garage in Verdal for NOK 680,000. It was supplemented by two urban services, to Brannan and Ydsedalen, in 1975.Erlandsen, 1995: 96‚Äì97 In 1973, Fylkesbilene introduced a route parallel to the Nordland Line from Steinkjer via Sn√•sa to Grong.Erlandsen, 1995: 102 Routes in Beitstad were taken over from Ivar Sems Bilruter on 1 November 1976. School routes in Overhalla were taken over in 1977. In 1978, passenger transport on the Namsos Line from Grong to Namsos was terminated, and Fylkesbilene took over the route.Erlandsen, 1995: 108 On 1 April 1979, Fylkesbilene took over the routes and nine buses in Levanger from Fjerdingen Busselskap, including five scheduled services and four school services.Erlandsen, 1995: 93 An Elgen bus, used as urban bus in Namsos On 29 April 1979, Fylkesbilene opened its combined bus station and train station at Steinkjer Station. It was the first such combined station in Norway, having cost NOK 3.7 million. In 1981, Fylkesbilene bought Arne Bruem's concessions and buses that operated the town bus in Steinkjer. From 1 September 1985, the infrastructure was upgrade and higher frequency introduced. The yellow Buster buses were introduced on the town routes in 1991.Erlandsen, 1995: 100‚Äì101 A garage was opened in Kolvereid in 1979, costing NOK 1.5 million.Erlandsen, 1995: 114 From 15 September 1983, Fylkesbilene started distribution of food produce from the cooperatives Namdalsmeieriet, B√∏ndenes Salgslag and Gartnerhallen to food stores in Namdalen, in a cooperation to reduce transport costs. In Verdals√∏ra, the company opened a bus station at Verdal Station on 1 October 1983 for NOK 2 million.Erlandsen, 1995: 96 In 1985, the bus route from Ytre Namdal was moved, so it went to Grong instead of Namsos. A town bus service was introduced in Levanger in 1985. In 1989, a new garage opened in Levanger. The same year, the company introduced the Environment Card monthly pass, that halved the price. The following year, the company's ridership doubled. 1990 also saw the introduction of a new livery: the old brown, red and beige colors were replaced with a \\"eurowhite\\" livery with a brown, red and beige cheatline. From 1994, the Bl√•mann town bus branding was introduced in Levanger and Verdal.Erlandsen, 1995: 138 =Tr√∏nderReiser= The work to establish a charter division began in the early 1980s, when the company realized that it had a large amount of idle capacity during the daytime, in the evenings and in the weekends. A concession was granted in 1983 and the first trip was from Follafoss to Mer√•ker for two days. In 1984, eight trips were offered, and six were made. Sales were done through Bennett Reisebureau and NSB Reisebyr√•. By 1986, the division had a revenue of NOK 4 million. By 1994, it had reached 17 million and offered 92 trips. That year, the division was rebranded Tr√∏nderReiser.Erlandsen, 1995: 121‚Äì125 Tr√∏nderReiser was in 1997 sold to some of the employees. In 1999, it was taken over by Sende Busstrafikk, but the company was not making money and filed for bankruptcy in December 2000. =Privatization= Tr√∏nderBilene's bus terminal in Steinkjer is part of Steinkjer Station A project group concluded in 1996 that the agency should be converted to a limited company. Tr√∏nderBilene was converted to a limited company from 1 January 1998, and at the same time Managing Director Alf Kroglund announced that he wanted to merge, join an alliance or sell part of the company. Three companies bid for part or all of Tr√∏nderBilene: Fosen Trafikklag, Hemne og Orkladal Billag and the consortium NT-Buss, led by Namsos Trafikkselskap. In October, the board rejected all the bids, stating that they were too low. The bid from Fosen involved them purchasing 66% of the company, while the other bids were for 100% of the shares. Fosen also proposed transferring Fosen's and Fosen's largest owner, Torghatten Trafikkselskap's bus divisions to Tr√∏nderBilene, and base the new company in Steinkjer. On 20 January 1999, the county council approved the Fosen bid, who paid NOK 29.7 million for the company. The Socialist Left Party and the Liberal Party were the only to vote against the sale. In March 2000, Tr√∏nderBilene announced the take-over of Fosen's bus divisions, as well as the ownership of Fosen's subsidiary Bilruta Frosta‚Äì√Ösen from 1 January 2001. The take-over increased Tr√∏nderBilene's revenue from NOK 100 to 180 million. At the same time, the company started serving Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes with its coach service from Namsos to Trondheim. Tr√∏nderBilenes fleet increased by 95 vehicles to 210 buses and trucks. The plans to include Torghatten's bus routes in the take- over were canceled. The take-over was financed through a NOK 11.4 million private placement by the two owners. In the 1990s, Fylkesbilene introduced a new, white livery, which has been continued by Tr√∏nderBilene In 2002, the company applied to start a coach service from Trondheim to Bod√∏ in cooperation with SB Nordlandsbuss, and concession was granted by the Ministry of Transport and Communications the following year. The concession had been supported by the county council in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, but their administration and the county council in Nordland was opposed because the coach service would take customers away from the railway. The route started on 1 March 2004. The route was terminated from 1 September, because the company failed to make it profitable. On 1 March 2003, Tr√∏nderBilene moved its head office from Steinkjer to Levanger. In 2003, the company increased its subsidies by NOK 8 million and its profits by NOK 4.8 million to 11.7 million. In June 2004, Tr√∏nderBilene bought 39% of Gauldal Billag from several private investors. The company held a 23% market share in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag, and the remaining shares were owned by the municipalities of R√∏ros, Holt√•len and Midtre Gauldal. From 1 January 2006, Tr√∏nderBilene merged with its subsidiary Bilrute Frosta‚Äì√Ösen. In January 2007, Tr√∏nderBilene increased their ownership in Namsos Trafikkselskap from 8.7 to 20.7%, becoming the company's second-largest owner after Helgelandske.

History  Founded by Australian businesswoman Sarina Bratton in early 2004, Orion Expedition Cruises began cruising operations in March 2005 with the repositioning cruise of the MV Orion from Papeete, Tahiti in French Polynesia to Sydney, Australia via the Cook Islands, Samoa, New Caledonia, Fiji and Lord Howe Island. OEC operated Australian-based expedition cruises in areas as diverse as the Antarctic continent to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. On 20 May 2008, Bratton, then Managing Director, announced the purchase of the company by US private equity firm KSL Capital Partners, and Cruise Ferry Master Fund (CFMF), a division of German shipping bank DVB. On 5 March 2013 it was announced that OEC had been acquired by US-based small ship operator Lindblad Expeditions, which owns five ships and charters a further five and operates cruises to a variety of destinations. CFMF also holds a 60% interest in Lindblad Expeditions.  Operations  MV Orion anchored off Kitava in Papua New Guinea‚Äôs Trobriand Islands with a traditional Kula Canoe in the foreground The concept behind the formation of the operation was to bring a new flavour of locally based luxury expedition-style cruising to Australia. In 2005 OEC made history by being the first cruise line to take a ship into the newly independent nation of East Timor. Visiting the capital Dili and the nation‚Äôs second largest center Baucau, guests of the Orion were some of the first tourists to be part of organized travel in the country. OEC planned to continue and expand their operations in East Timor in 2006, but the company‚Äôs plans were suspended when the fledgling nation became unstable just a few weeks before the Orion was due to dock in Dili in June 2006. The Indonesian port of Kupang in West Timor replaced Dili in OEC‚Äôs itinerary. The company offered expedition cruises to Antarctica from the Australian island of Tasmania and the New Zealand port of Bluff, in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia from the port of Darwin, to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands from the ports of Cairns and Rabaul as well as occasional cruises along the east coast of Australia focusing on the Great Barrier Reef and some cruising around Tasmania. Following OEC‚Äôs acquisition by Lindblad Expeditions in March 2013, it was announced that cruises to Orion's destination mainstays of Indonesia, Borneo, Papua New Guinea and the Kimberleys would continue. In March 2014 itineraries to more easterly and remote Pacific islands were added. Orion was to be equipped with an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV), capacity for up to 24 scuba divers and oceangoing kayaks, with cruises to be accompanied by a National Geographic photographer. In a statement in January 2015,http://www.expeditioncruising.com/2015/01/lindblad-quits-kimberley-ng- orion-to.html Lindblad surprised the industry by announcing that Orion would be based in Europe for the northern summer from 2016, ceasing Southern Hemisphere winter operations.  MV Orion  MV Orion in Kuri Bay on Western Australia's Kimberley Coast The luxury expedition ship , the backbone of OEC, has been described by the Berlitz Guide to Cruising as \\"the latest in the quest to build the perfect expedition vessel\\". Owned by the Marshall Islands registered company Explorer Maritime and leased under a long-term agreement by OEC, the vessel was previously operated, albeit for a short time, by US-based cruise operator Travel Dynamics International (TDI). TDI had operated the vessel in the Antarctic and the Arctic and many points in between before handing the vessel over to OEC in the Tahitian port of Papeete in March 2005. The MV Orion will be renamed the National Geographic Orion from March 2014, and join Lindblad Expeditions owned National Geographic Endeavour, MS National Geographic Explorer, National Geographic Islander, National Geographic Sea Bird and National Geographic Sea Lion, along with their chartered vessels Delfin II, Jahan, Lord of the Glens, Oceanic Discoverer and Sea Cloud.http://www.expeditioncruising.com/2013/03/orion-expedition-cruises- acquired-by.html =Vessel specifications= *Length: 103 metres *Beam: 14.25 metres *Draft: 3.82 metres *Hull: Ice-reinforced for voyages in the Arctic and Antarctic *Ice Class: E3 (Germanischer Lloyd) *Gross Tonnage: 4,000 *Engines: Mak; 8M25; 3,265HP *Speed: 14.0 knots *Stabilisers: Blohm & Voss, retractable fin stabilisers *Manoeuvrability: Bow and stern thrusters *Year Built: 2003 *Delivery Date: November 2003 *Builder: Cassens Shipyard-Emden, Germany *Staterooms and Suites: 53 *Guest Capacity: 106 (twin occupancy). 24 additional guests may be accommodated in convertible sofa or upper Pullman beds. *Elevator: Yes *Classification: Germanischer Lloyd; 100 A5 E3 Passenger Ship; MC E3 AUT *Regulations: Orion is built according to the latest international safety regulations, including those of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health, Canadian Arctic Shipping, and St. Lawrence Seaway. *Additional Craft: 10 Zodiac Heavy Duty MK5 Inflatables, 10 Sea Kayaks, and a Fishing Boat *Communications: Direct-dial satellite telephones; fax; e-mail; Internet access; internal telephone system *Registry: Bahamas and manned and providored by V-Ships Leisure, of Monaco.

It is the centre of the Alpine Valchiavenna region. The historic town is a member of the Cittaslow movement. Geography Chiavenna is located about north of Milan and about northwest of Sondrio. The town is situated on the right bank of the river Mera about north of Lake Como. The river course leads up to Val Bregaglia in the east and the Swiss border at Castasegna. In the north, the Valle Spluga stretches up to Passo dello Spluga and the road to Chur in the Grisons. Chiavenna borders the following municipalities: Mese, Piuro, Prata Camportaccio, and San Giacomo Filippo. The municipality of Chiavenna contains the frazioni (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) Campedello, Loreto, Pianazzola, and San Carlo. As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 7,263 and an area of .All demographics and other statistics: Italian statistical institute Istat. History =Antiquity= Porticato della Collegiata di S. Lorenzo Salis impailing Salis, (a.k.a. Salicibus), 16th- or 17th-century heraldry, (photo 2009). The name of Chiavenna, believed to derive by paretymology from clavis () referring to its pivotal position on the mountain passes between Northern Italy and the Posterior Rhine valley, comes in reality from a much older, pre-Latin (probably ligurian and certainly non- Celtic) etymon klava, meaning fallen rocks of a mountain slip. In Roman times Clavenna, conquered in 16 BC by the troops of Emperor Augustus during his Alpine campaigns, temporarily was a town of the Raetia et Vindelicia province, though actually located on the Italian (Cisalpine Gaul) side of the Alpine crest, north of the head of the Lacus Larius (modern Lake Como) at the entrance of the Valle Spluga. The Romans had two important roads built from Clavenna: the itineraries demonstrate that the route up the Valle Spluga to Spl√ºgen Pass was frequented in ancient times; as well as another, which separated from it at Clavenna, and led by a more circuitous route up the Val Bregaglia (Val Chiavenna) and across Septimer Pass to Curia (modern Chur), where it rejoined the preceding road. (Itin. Ant. pp. 277, 278; Tab. Peut.; P. Diac. vi. 29.) These passes had already played an important role as a line of supply for the Roman legion. It was by one or other of the roads that Magister militium Stilicho crossed the Alps in midwinter, a feat celebrated by Claudian (de B. Get. 320‚Äì358). =Middle Ages= The Mera Chiavenna from the north, June 2009. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire the city marked the northern limit of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy. Clavenna belonged to the Italian territories retaken by the Byzantine Empire in the mid-6th century during the reign of Emperor Justinian the Great and avoided capture by the Lombard kingdom until the 7th century. Clavenna probably derived some importance from its position at the junction of the two pass roads, as does the modern town of Chiavenna, which is the chief town of the surrounding district. When the East Frankish king Otto I married the dowager queen Adelaide of Italy in October 951 and campaigned against King Berengar II, he assigned the Val Bregaglia and the control over Septimer Pass to the Bishopric of Chur, while the Bishops of Como held the adjacent estates from Villa down to Chiavenna in the southwest (corresponding to the current Italian-Swiss border). In 961 King Otto himself took the Septimer road to traverse the Alps on his way to Rome to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor the following year. The citizens of Chiavenna received town privileges from the Como bishops in 1030. Barbarossa kneeling in front of Henry the Lion, S√§chsische Weltchronik (13th century) Chiavenna is crowned by a ruined castle, once an important strategic point, and the seat of the counts who ruled the valley from the time of the Goths till 1194, when the district was handed over to the Bishops of Chur. In medieval times, the castello served as a residence of local counts controlling the Alpine passes in the north and east. The Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa first crossed Septimer Pass on his Italian campaign of 1163/64. It was in Chiavenna, where in 1176 he met with his Welf cousin, the Saxon duke Henry the Lion. He allegedly fell on his knees to implore Henry's aid against the cities of the Lombard League, however, the duke refused. Two years later, the forces of the Chur bishops advanced across the Alpine crest into the Val Bregaglia and by 1194, Chiavenna was incorporated into the Upper Raetian territories of the Duchy of Swabia. With the adjacent Valtellina (Veltlin) valley in the southeast, the town was acquired by the Visconti lords of Milan in 1335 from the Chur bishops. =Modern times= During the time of the transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy from the early 15th century onwards, Chiavenna was controlled by the Three Leagues' forces, fighting against the Sforza who had succeeded the Visconti as Dukes of Milan. In 1486 they set Chiavenna ablaze; two years later, Ludovico Sforza had the town fortified. Nevertheless, Chiavenna was conquered by the Leagues's forces during the War of the League of Cambrai, when they allied with the Swiss Confederacy defeating the French troops of King Louis XII at the 1513 Battle of Novara. Together with the Valtellina and Bormio (Worms), the Chiavenna estates became bailiwicks governed by the Three Leagues. A first Protestant parish arose in 1542; thereafter, Chiavenna became a centre of the Reformation while numerous religious refugees from the Italian lands settled here, among them notable theologians like Camillo Renato, Bernardino Ochino, and Girolamo Zanchi. Temporarily lost during the B√ºndner Wirren in 1620‚Äì39 during the Thirty Years' War, the Three Leagues' rule over Chiavenna actually lasted until 1797, when the French revolutionaries merged it into the Cisalpine Republic which was rapidly promoted to the Regno d'Italia with Eug√®ne de Beauharnais as Vicer√© (the King being Napoleon Bonaparte himself).. Hence, together with neighbouring Bormio and Valtellina valleys, it did not form part of the Swiss Confederacy, as the Free State of the Three Leagues (modern Canton of Grisons, ) was not part of Switzerland until Napoleon's much later conquest. To this day, there is a statue of the Anglo-Swiss count Peter de Salis (1738‚Äì1807) in Chiavenna, from the time when he was governor of the Valtellina. After the fall of Napoleon, from 1815 to 1859 Chiavenna and the whole of Lombardy and Veneto went to the House of Habsburg, who always wanted control of the pass from Austria to Milan to link the Habsburg families. During the favourable time of the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia, primary schools were created in every place, and the instruction was made obligatory for maids. Lombard and Venetic women where the first to be alphabetised in Italy, long before the women of other Italian provinces. The Austrian administration build bold modern routes (Spluga, Stelvio), created hospitals and brought the level of medicine in Milan up to the top for the time. A citizen of Chiavenna could study in the universities of Innsbruck, Vienna, Prague, Budapest. He could serve in the imperial army, become an officer, accede to the higher administration, and be ennobled. After the proclamation of the Sabaudian Regno d'Italia, Chiavenna followed the sort of the rest of Lombardy. On 6 June 2000, a Catholic sister, Maria Laura Mainetti, was murdered in a satanic sacrifice by three teenage girls.

Copenhagen in the Danish Superliga championship, where he debuted in April 2004. He scored seven goals in nine games during his first season, and helped the club win the 2003‚Äì04 Danish Superliga title as well as the 2004 Danish Cup trophy. In the following season, sharp competition from strikers Alvaro Santos and Sibusiso Zuma kept Bech out of his preferred striker role. He was either used as a substitute, or in the role of winger. Bech transferred to Swedish club Malm√∂ FF in the summer 2005. At Malm√∂, he looked to replace Swedish international striker Markus Rosenberg before the UEFA Champions League qualification, but Bech never got a breakthrough at the club. Following one year at Malm√∂, he moved back to Denmark to play for Esbjerg fB in the summer 2006. In the first half of the 2006‚Äì07 Superliga season, Bech rediscovered his goal scoring form, and was at a time the joint top goalscorer of the league. On 15 November 2006 he got his Danish national team debut in a friendly match against the Czech Republic, when he came on the pitch in the second half, as a substitute for Peter L√∏venkrands.

Michael Praetorius includes such an instrument in his Syntagma Musicum, describing its 'strong and magnificent sound like a harpsichord.' In the Sciagraphia is an illustration (plate 7) of a Dominici Zw√∂lff Ch√∂richte Cither (Dominici twelve course cittern), with re- entrant bass string tunings of eb, Bb, f, c, g, d, a, e, and treble strings tuned to b, g, d' and e'. The instrument has a body shape with constructional features similar to a viol or modern guitar. Some early 17th century illustrations of citterns have body shapes resembling this instrument, while the Swiss halszither - a traditional regional cittern that survived until the present, has also been constructed with a similar body. Plate 5 of the Sciagraphia illustrates a Gross Sechs Ch√∂richte Cither; (large six course cittern) - depicted with eight pegs inserted into the sides of the pegbox and six strings. Like the cittern, the ceterone was also built with a flat-backed body in teardrop shape, with a single large 'rose', and had fixed, metal frets (unlike the tied, gut frets of the lute family) and used metal strings. The unfretted bass strings were attached to a neck extension, the instrument totalling perhaps as much as 1.5 metres in length. A single original example exists in Museo Bardini in Florence, dating from around 1600 and built by the cittern luthier Gironimo Campi. The museum has labelled the instrument as an arci cetera, (arch cittern).

Robinson's book contains 5 pieces for a 14 course instrument and an illustration. The depiction appears to show 7 double string courses for the fingerboard and 7 open single string courses running up to a neck extension and presumably back inside to the pegbox. According to Robinson, the \\"...invention was first begun by an Italian in Italy, but altered, and strings augmented by me.\\" External links * Modern Ceterone constructed by Ron Banks of Texas, on which he uses a scalloped fretboard.

He was born in Panama but raised in Jamaica, moving to Britain in the 1950s to pursue university education. A prolific writer and editor, he was the author of more than 30 books in the course of his career, including novels for adults and for children, poetry collections, anthologies, travelogues and essays. He died in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he had been teaching since the 1970s, holding a lifetime position as Writer-In-Residence at Hampshire College.Rhonda Cobham-Sander, \\"Going with the flow\\", Anthurium: A Caribbean Studies Journal, Vol. 10, Issue 2 [2013], Art. 14; p. 6. Career He was born as Felix Andrew Alexander Salkey in Col√≥n, Panama, to Jamaican parents, Andrew Alexander Salkey, a businessman, and Linda Marshall Salkey. When two years old, Salkey was sent to Jamaica, where he was raised by his grandmother and his mother, who worked there as a teacher, while his father continued to work in Panama.Andrew Salkey biography . Encyclopedia of AfroEuropean Studies. Salkey was educated at St George's College, in Kingston, and at Munro College, in St. Elizabeth, before going to England in the early 1950s to attend the College of St Mark and St John. According to Stuart Hall, Salkey \\"quickly took his place at the centre of a small but outstanding circle of Caribbean writers and intellectuals. For a critical period he was the key figure, the main presenter and writer-in-residence in the Caribbean section of the BBC World Service at Bush House, London, and his programmes became a glittering showcase for a generation of writers, including Sam Selvon and George Lamming, who had made London their second home. Established and aspiring authors were chivvied, cajoled, gently chastised, inspired and schooled to produce new work for radio on the Caribbean Voices programme over which Andrew Salkey often presided.\\"Stuart Hall, \\"Obituary: Andrew Salkey\\", The Independent, 16 May 1995. After reading V. S. Naipaul's first story Salkey encouraged him to continue writing.Hilary Mantel, \\"Naipaul's Book of the World\\" (review of The Writer and the World), New York Review of Books, 24 October 2002. At the BBC, he also helped write the production My People and Your People with D. G. Bridson, a radio play about a love affair between a West Indian migrant and a Scottish skiffle player. Salkey was a part of the West Indian Students Union (WISU), which provided an effective forum for Caribbean students to express their ideas and provided voluntary support to the \\"harassed\\" working-class Caribbean immigrant community, during the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The association also included Gerry Burton, Arif Ali, Chris LeMaitre, John La Rose and Horace Lashley. In the mid-1950s Salkey taught English at Walworth Secondary School (also known as Mina Road school), an early comprehensive just off the Old Kent Road in South-east London. His first novel, A Quality of Violence ‚Äì set around 1900 in a remote area of Jamaica, and narrated in a Jamaican patois\\"Andrew Salkey\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. ‚Äì was published in 1959, and his second, Escape to An Autumn Pavement, in 1960. That same year Salkey edited one of the first anthologies of Caribbean short stories, West Indian Stories, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the field of folklore and popular culture. His novels that followed were The Late Emancipation of Jerry Stover (1968), The Adventures of Catullus Kelly (1969) and Come Home, Malcolm Heartland (1976). He was a prolific writer and subsequently published several books for children, poetry, travelogues, books that drew on folk traditions, including Anancy's Score (1973), as well as editing anthologies including Breaklight (1971). In 1966 he co-founded with John La Rose and Kamau Brathwaite the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM), as a platform for Caribbean artists, writers, actors and musicians. Salkey gave an address at CAM's third and final conference, held at the West Indian Students' Centre, in which he talked about the importance of \\"Black awareness\\", and stated: \\"Our own Caribbean communities must become the new centres of which we first seek approval of the fruits of our imagination. Only then may we move from within our society outward with assurance.\\"Quoted in Rob Waters, \\"Henry Swanzy, Sartre's zombie? Black Power and the transformation of the Caribbean Artists Movement\\", in Claire Wintle and Ruth Craggs (eds), Cultures of Decolonisation: Transnational Productions and Practices, 1945-70, Manchester University Press, 2016, p. 79. In the latter part of his life he was a professor of creative writing at Hampshire College in Amherst, where he went in 1976. Salkey was good friends with Austin Clarke, and the two had a long correspondence, a great deal of which is available in Clarke's files at the McMaster University Archives in Hamilton, Ontario. \\"Salkey's Score\\" Salkey was a director and constant supporter of the London-based publishing company Bogle-L'Ouverture founded by Guyanese-born Jessica Huntley, who (together with a committee comprising Louis James, John La Rose, Marc Matthews, Mervyn Morris, Jason Salkey, Anne Walmsley, Eliot Salkey and Ronald Warwick) organised a two-day symposium and celebration called \\"Salkey's Score\\". Held on 19‚Äì20 June 1992 at the Commonwealth Institute, the event paid tribute to Salkey in respect of his work in London in the 1960s and 1970s with the Caribbean Artists Movement; his journalism on the BBC radio programme Caribbean Voices; his contributions to developing the teaching of Caribbean writing in schools; the importance he gave to the relationship of Africa to personal and communal Caribbean identity; his work in Cuba; and his prolific output of novels, poetry and other writings.Aim25, Archives in London and the M25 Area, \\"Salkey Score Committee\\", held at London Metropolitan Archives.

New Jersey is a state within the United States of America that lies on the north eastern edge of the North American continent. It shares a land border with the state of State of New York along the north, ratified by both states after the New York ‚Äì New Jersey Line War. New Jersey is slightly larger than the country of Kuwait. The Atlantic Ocean is east of the state. It is separated from New York, in particular the boroughs of the Bronx and Manhattan in New York City by the Hudson River, and from Staten Island by the Kill van Kull and the Arthur Kill. Liberty Island is an exclave of State of New York in New Jersey waters in Upper New York Bay. Ellis Island, also in the Upper Bay, and Shooter's Island, in Newark Bay, each have sections belonging to either of the two states. On its west, New Jersey is flanked by the Delaware River that forms its border with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Delaware Bay which separates New Jersey from the State of Delaware. However, due to a fluke in a colonial land grant for the city of New Castle, Delaware (called The Twelve- Mile Circle), there is a small amount of Delaware territory in contiguous New Jersey. Finns Point, piers at Penns Grove, New Jersey and Pennsville, and Artificial Island, the tip of a small peninsula at Lower Alloways Creek are connected to Salem County. A coal pier in Logan Township also extends into the river. New Jersey's natural regions were formed by glaciers. Area New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the U.S. New Jersey is ranked 47th of the fifty states that comprise the United States of America in terms of area. The total area of the state is , of which 14.9% or is water, and 85.1%, or , is land. New Jersey spans 70 miles (110 km) at its widest, and 166 miles (267 km) in length. Due to its small size, New Jersey, which ranks eleventh in the nation in terms of population with 8,791,894 people, ranks first in population density, with . However, while this offers the impression that New Jersey is entirely urban or suburban, it is not. Large swaths of northwestern and southern New Jersey are extremely rural. For example, Walpack Township in Sussex County, has a population of 39 and an area of . Political geography The State of New Jersey is divided into 21 counties, which contain a total of 566 municipalities. Like many New England states, all land in New Jersey is incorporated. New Jersey municipalities have a strong tradition of independent home rule which, as a result, means that county government is comparatively weaker than in other states and more open to criticisms of waste and ineffectiveness.N.J. County Governments Coming Under Fire, Associated Press, Oct. 31, 2005 Climate Rivers New Jersey rivers includes streams formally designated as rivers. There are also smaller streams (i.e., branches, creeks, drains, forks, licks, runs, etc.) in the state. Major rivers include the Manasquan, Maurice, Mullica, Passaic, Rahway, Raritan, Musconetcong, and Delaware rivers. Historically, the Delaware and Raritan rivers have provided transportation of goods and people inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and were once connected by the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Today, these rivers, and the streams that feed them, provide sport and recreation for many people. The Raritan River in Middlesex County is often considered the borderline between North and South/Central Jersey, although it is not official. Geology Around 250 million years ago, during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, the area that is today New Jersey bordered northern Africa as part of the supercontinent of Pangea. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains. Around 200 million years ago, Pangea began to break apart, separating the North American continent from the African continent. Around 18,000 years ago, the most recent ice age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind Lake Passaic, as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.Geological History by Great Swamp Watershed Association, retrieved December 22, 2006. =Physiographic Provinces= Physiographic Provinces of New Jersey New Jersey is a region with a high variety of geographical features in a small area. The area can be broken into five regions, corresponding roughly to geological zones. These regions from north to south are the Appalachian Valley and Ridge, Highlands, Newark Basin Piedmont, Inner Coastal Plain, and the Outer Coastal Plain. Appalachian Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province The Delaware Water Gap from Knowlton Township in New Jersey. Shaded relief map The Appalachian Valley and Ridge lies in the northwestern corner of the state and includes the Kittatinny Mountains, several smaller valleys and the popular Delaware Water Gap. The state's highest point, the aptly named High Point is within this area, at . Most of the state's section of the Appalachian Trail runs through this area. The province is bounded on the southeast by an unconformity between Cambrian and Precambrian formations. Highlands Physiographic Province The Highlands Physiographic Province is a geological formation composed primarily of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock running from the Delaware River near Musconetcong Mountain, northeast through the Skylands Region of New Jersey along the Bearfort Ridge and the Ramapo Mountains. Numerous abandoned mines dot the region, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries when iron, copper, zinc and other minerals were extracted from the formations. The glaciated northern half of the province has an abundance of lakes and reservoirs which serve as water supplies for the urban areas to the east. The region's watershed is protected by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act. Newark Basin Piedmont USGS map of the Newark Basin showing major highways The Newark Basin is a region in northern New Jersey defined by the boundaries of a sediment-filled rift basin. This basin was formed when the supercontinent Pangaea began to split approximately 220 million years ago, causing several large depressions to form due to extension, which then filled with sediment. The basin itself extends from Rockland County in the southern tip of New York to south-eastern Pennsylvania. It lies within the broader region known as the Piedmont, a crescent-shaped area characterized by smooth topography and large volumes of sediments. Like the Piedmont, the Newark Basin has gentle topography consisting of red bed clastic sediments with occasional igneous rock formations, such as the Palisades Sill and the Watchung basalt flows; these igneous features are responsible for the dramatic elevation changes observed in the region, such as The Palisades and the Watchung Mountains, respectively. The boundaries of the Newark Basin, as well as major highways, are shown on the map at left. For the geological history of the region, see Newark Basin. Inner Coastal Plain The Inner Coastal Plain province consists of lowlands and rolling hills underlain by Cretaceous deposits. Surficial geology in this region contains a number of fossils. The Monmouth County Park system, for example, includes a number of creeks where students and enthusiasts can gain real field exposure to cretaceous geology and paleontology. (Always check with the park service staff regarding permissibility before entering any field site.) The region's northwest border lies along the Piedmont Fall Line. Fertile, loamy soil makes the land ideal for agriculture and is responsible for New Jersey's nickname of the \\"Garden State\\". Its deposits of Greensand marl containing potash were used since colonial days by farmers to fertilize their fields. Beach at Avalon. Outer Coastal Plain The outer coastal plain consists of unconsolidated Tertiary deposits of sands, silt, and gravels. The soils are sandy with less clay than the inner coastal plain, and are more acidic and dry. The lack of fertility makes much of the region unsuitable for agriculture and large areas remain undeveloped. The sandy Pine Barrens, an area that is agriculturally poor but species rich, occupy the center of the province. Blueberries and cranberries have been cultivated in lowland bogs that have accumulated depths of organic matter. Along the coast, sandy beaches attract a recreation industry, and the offshore barrier islands are popular vacation destinations. Natural environment New Jersey's natural environment preserves a range of habitats ranging from the Atlantic shore to the Appalachian Mountains. The sandy uplands of South Jersey are home to the Atlantic coastal pine barrens. Surrounding the Pine Barrens, along the coast and covering the Inner Coastal Plain and Piedmont, are the Northeastern coastal forests. The Highlands consist of Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests which grade into Allegheny Highlands forests in the far northeast. The South Branch Raritan River in Califon Tourist regions New Jersey State Department of Tourism distinguishes six distinct tourist regions: the Gateway, Greater Atlantic City, the Southern Shore Region, the Delaware River Region, the Shore Region and the Skylands Region. Cultural regions =Historical emigrations= =New Jersey's ethnic communities today= *New Jersey has one of the fastest growing Asian American communities in the United States. *Along with the increase in the population of Asian immigrants and their posterity, steady populations of European Americans have remained large since their immigration into New York during the 18th, 19th and 20th Century and their movement westward, the largest of this ancestry groups being Italians, Irish, German and Polish. =Regional cultural divisions= Although it is small, New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the US, and this density lends itself to significant regional cultural divisions. South Jersey culture is influenced by its proximity to Philadelphia as well as the southern portions of its shore and beaches. South Jersey is more politically conservative and rural, and they call their long sandwiches \\"Hoagies\\". Affiliation with South Jersey is most prevalent from Burlington County south. North Jersey culture (particularly northeastern New Jersey) is influenced by its proximity to New York City. Most affiliation with North Jersey occurs north of the line formed by Hunterdon, Morris, and Union Counties. North Jersey drives most of the stereotypes associated with New Jersey. It contains the only part of the state in which people speak with a \\"Jersey accent\\" stemming from that regions proximity to New York City. It is the most affluent and populous, and urban part of the state, driving much of New Jersey's liberal politics and famously high property taxes. They refer to their long sandwiches as \\"Subs\\". Interestingly, the state is in one sense united by being the only place in which pork roll - a type of pork sausage similar to bologna that is meatier and more suitable for frying - is ubiquitously found. In another sense, however, it drives the halves of the state farther apart in a bizarre disagreement over whether it should be referred to as pork roll or by its brand name, \\"Taylor Ham\\". In between North and South Jersey lies Central Jersey, which bears cultural traits similar to both and distinct from either. Although its distinctiveness is denied by many who live to the north and south, its denizens tend to have an aversion to being associated with either culture in general. Central Jersey's anthropogenic landscape is typified by more suburban features than their northeastern counterparts and a less rural landscape than counties in the south and northwest.
