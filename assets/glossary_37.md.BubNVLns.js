She is known as a pioneer of carnal art, a form of self-portraiture that utilizes body modification to distort one's appearance. She adopted the pseudonym \\"ORLAN\\" in 1971. She lives and works in Paris and sits on the board of administrators for the Palais de Tokyo, She was previously a professor at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'arts de Cergy-Pontoise. Biography =Early works= ORLAN's career as a performance artist began in 1964, when she performed Marches au ralenti (Slow motion walks) in her hometown of Saint- √âtienne. During these performances, she would walk as slowly as possible between two central parts of the city. A year later, she produced MesuRages, in which she used her own body as a measuring instrument. With her \\"ORLAN- body\\" as the unit of measurement, she evaluated how many people could fit within a given architectural space. This was the first time she utilized her Trousseau, a set of household goods and other items traditionally provided to a young woman by her family upon her marriage, in a performance piece. Her Trousseau was re-purposed in a number of subsequent projects. Between 1964 and 1966, she produced Vintages, a series of black and white photographic works. She destroyed the original negatives of these pieces, and today only one copy of each photograph remains. In this series, she posed naked in various yoga- like positions. One of the most famous pictures of this series is ORLAN accouche d'elle m'aime. She produced a body of work entitled Tableaux Vivants between 1967 and 1975, which she based on the works of prominent Baroque artists like El Greco and Gericault. In reference to Baroque art, she used inmates as models, wore exaggerated faux-Baroque costumes, and drew inspiration from Caravaggesque stereotypes. In 1971, she \\"baptized herself\\" Sainte-ORLAN, adorning herself with billowing black vinyl and white leatherette. Color photographs of Saint ORLAN were later incorporated into photo-collages, videos, and films tracing a fictive hagiography. Like her Tableaux Vivants, much of her work involving Saint ORLAN was directly inspired by Baroque art. During the 1977 FIAC International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris, ORLAN executed controversial performance piece The Artist's Kiss (Le baiser de l'artiste). Outside the Grand Palais, a life-size photo of her torso was turned into a slot machine. Spectators could see the coin they inserted into the torso descend down into a groin before being awarded a kiss from the artist. The following year, she created Documentary Study: The Head of Medusa, in which the artist displayed her sexual organs during menstruation under a magnifying glass. The installation was organized in Aachen, Germany on occasion of an International Symposium of Performance Art at the Ludwig Forum for International art. The piece's title was derived from the statement by Sigmund Freud that \\"at the sight of the vulva, even the devil runs away,\\" which he articulated in his short, posthumously-published essay entitled \\"Medusa's Head.\\" In 1978, she founded the International Symposium of Performance in Lyon. In 1982, she collaborated with artist Fr√©d√©ric Develay to create the first online magazine of contemporary art, Art-Acc√®s-Revue, on France's precursor to the Internet, the Minitel. =The Reincarnation of Saint-ORLAN= The Reincarnation of Sainte-ORLAN, a new project that started in 1990, involves a series of plastic surgeries through which the artist transformed herself into elements from famous paintings and sculptures of women. As a part of her \\"Carnal Art\\" manifesto, these works were filmed and broadcast in institutions throughout the world, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Sandra Gehring Gallery in New York.Orlan 'Manifesto of Carnal Art/L'Art Charnel and Refiguration/Self-Hybridation series and other works' vol.12 July 2003 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal pp.44-48 ORLAN's goal in these surgeries is to acquire the ideal of female beauty as depicted by male artists. When the surgeries are complete, she will have the chin of Botticelli's Venus, the nose of Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me's Psyche, the lips of Fran√ßois Boucher's Europa, the eyes of Diana (as depicted in a 16th-century French School of Fontainebleau painting), and the forehead of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. ORLAN picked these characters, \\"not for the canons of beauty they represent... but rather on account of the stories associated with them.\\" ORLAN chose Diana, because she is inferior to the gods and men, but is leader of the goddesses and women; Mona Lisa, because of the standard of beauty, or anti-beauty, that she represents; Psyche, because of the fragility and vulnerability within her soul; Venus, for carnal beauty; and Europa, for her adventurous outlook on the future. Instead of condemning cosmetic surgery, ORLAN embraces it; \\"ORLAN's work symbolically marks the passage between the seventies and the cyberfeminist nineties, fully embracing the possibilities opened by advanced technologies.\\" instead of rejecting the masculine, she incorporates it; and instead of limiting her identity, she defines it as \\"nomadic, mutant, shifting, differing.\\" ORLAN has stated, \\"my work is a struggle against the innate, the inexorable, the programmed, Nature, DNA (which is our direct rival as far as artists of representation are concerned), and God!\\". \\"I can observe my own body cut open, without suffering!... I see myself all the way down to my entrails; a new mirror stage... I can see to the heart of my lover; his splendid design has nothing to do with sickly sentimentalities... Darling, I love your spleen; I love your liver; I adore your pancreas, and the line of your femur excites me.\\" (from Carnal Art manifesto) \\"Sainte ORLAN\\" came from a character that I created for \\"Le baiser de l'artiste\\" from a text called \\"Facing a society of mothers and merchants.\\" The first line of this text was: \\"At the bottom of the cross were two women, Maria and Maria Magdalena.\\" These are two inevitable stereotypes of women that are hard to avoid: the mother and the prostitute. In \\"Le baiser de l'artiste\\" there were two faces. One was Saint ORLAN, a cutout picture of me dressed as Madonna glued onto wood. One could buy a five francs church candle and I was sitting on the other side behind the mock-up of the vending machine. One could buy a French kiss from me for the same amount of money one could buy a candle. The idea was to play on the ambivalence of the woman figure and the desire of both men and women towards those biblical and social stereotypes. Being showcased in the Paris International Contemporary Art Fair, the artwork was somehow both an installation and a performance,\\" said ORLAN, in her interview with Acne Paper. Recent works Since 1998, ORLAN has been creating a digital photographic series titled \\"Self-Hybridizations,\\" where her face merges with past facial representations (masks, sculptures, paintings) of non-western civilizations. So far, three have been completed: Pre-Columbian, Native American and African. In 2001, she orchestrated a series of filmic posters, \\"Le Plan du Film,\\" with various artists and writers. The posters affirm the existence of films which do not actually exist. The posters question the notions of character and narrative reflected in the social reality of individual roles and stories. In 2007, ORLAN collaborated with the Symbiotica laboratory in Australia, resulting in the bio-art installation \\"The Harlequin's Coat.\\" Part of her on-going work includes \\"Suture/Hybridize/Recycle,\\" a generative and collaborative series of clothing made from Orlan's wardrobe and focusing on suture: the deconstruction of past clothing reconstructed into new clothing that highlights the sutures.

Lopud is economically the most developed of the Elaphiti Islands, and can be reached by boat from Dubrovnik, Trsteno, Ora≈°ac and Zaton. The island is famous for its sandy beaches,Frommer's Croatia by Karen Torme Olson & Sanja Bazulic Olson in particular the bay of ≈†unj. Lopud is the second largest island of the Elaphiti islands, between Koloƒçep and ≈†ipan. It is famous as the \\"island in the middle\\" (Insula Media, or Mezzo). It has an area of and its highest point is Polaƒçica, above sea level. It has of coastline, of which is sandy.  History  The central island known as Elaphite (Deer) archipelago 7Nm away from Dubrovnik and with an area of 4.6 square km was a frequent station of ancient Greeks and later Romans. There are no substantial proof, but the Greek name Delaphodia for present Lopud as well as Igalo for the waterfront (promenade) confirm the early presence of Greeks on the island. In the 9th century the island was inhabited by Croats, a fact supported by four old Croatian churches and a bulk of archeological finds. Very early (prior to 10th century) it becomes part of Commune of Dubrovnik and immediately upon the establishment of the Republic of Dubrovnik it makes part of it. Due to its central location Lopud gets the name of Isola di Mezzo. The 15th and 16th centuries were the Golden Age for the island. Thanks to the prospering shipping industry and sea trade (even with Americas) as well as shipbuilding and agriculture the island was a highly cultured one. The well-educated monks of the Franciscans (1483) and Dominican (1482) monasteries made way for literacy on the island. In addition to elementary school the Dominican had the first three grades of high school in their curriculum. It is generally considered that the island's seamen receive the basic knowledge in navigation they were to use during their successful voyages. Places and mansions were erected. The names of Lopud streets, as well as its many houses and over thirty churches and chapels tell stories of town of Lopud. The Dubrovnik Republic was reinforced by the island's eighty ship merchant fleet both in war and in peace. Writers and poets alike were so impressed with Lopud at that period that they presented it as a city with population of 14 thousand. The history of Lopud regrettably has not been explored thoroughly. However, judging by currently available documents the island at its peak had around 2 thousands inhabitants. For comparison, in 2010 only 200 people inhabit the island. From the 17th century on, its economic power began to decline along with its population. In the last three centuries the island's population fluctuated between 600 and 350. In 1990's 284 people lived on the island. Conquest of Napoleon in 1808 brought end to monasteries' activities. During the Astro-Hungarian rule, Lopud people subsisted on fishery, agriculture, sailing on merchant ships and working abroad, particularly in USA. In addition to the basic local occupations, the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries introduced waving production. with over 50 looms, Lopud turns into an industry center for the area. This trade represents emancipation of Lopud women too. The whole area today covered with vegetation, only 80 years ago was cultivated and covered by olive-groves (19 olive mills). From 1927-1990 tourism made its mark and the island's population enjoyed a safe and stable period. After WWII all private owned hotels were confiscated and become state property. In the last few years, hotel's buildings of \\"Hoteli Lopud\\" enterprise has taken on 90 permanent employees and during summer seasons hire more. The raised standard of living saw construction of newly built stone houses and flats in Dubrovnik. During the aggression against the Republic of Croatia from 1991-1995 business was operated in war conditions and enterprise going bankrupt as a consequence. The so-called privatization, the sell-off the hotels and real estate, as well as devastation, unemployment and job insecurity led to population decrease and young Lopud people had to look for life opportunities elsewhere. Despite the natural resources and potentiality of comfortable life, since 1992 Lopud has been passing the saddest period in its long history. On 22 July 1813, marines and seamen from and captured the French garrison on the island, which consisted of six guns and 59 men.

Life and career Born to an affluent trader in the Danube River town of Svishtov, he attended the Faculty of Law of Odessa University (formerly the Imperial Novorossiya University), graduating in 1885. He worked as a lawyer in Sofia before embarking on a career as a writer. His first novel, organized as a collection of short stories, Bay Ganyo (translating to uncle Ganyo), describes the travels of an itinerant peddler of rose oil and rugs through Western Europe. Though impertinent and clumsy, Bay Ganyo proves to be ingenious and is considered by some scholars to be a mirror for a modernizing Bulgaria. The character is believed to be based on a Karlovo tradesman, Ganyo Somov. Konstantinov, a cosmopolitan traveler, was the first Bulgarian to write about his visits to Western Europe and America. His visits to the World Exhibitions in Paris in 1889, Prague in 1891 and Chicago in 1893 - including a visit to Niagara Falls - provided Bulgarian readers, who had recently gained independence from nearly 500 years of Turkish Ottoman oppression, with a portrait of the developed world. To Chicago and Back (where Bay Ganyo appears again), his travel notes from his American trip, spurred a lasting interest in Chicago, which today boasts the largest concentration of Bulgarian immigrants in the United States. There is a bust of the writer in the University of Chicago's Regenstein Library and a section of Irving Park Road in Chicago is named after him. Honorary Chicago, New Signs 2017 He was assassinated in 1897 near Radilovo while traveling to Peshtera, most likely by mistake with the intended target being his friend (a local politician), with whom he had changed places in their coach shortly before the fatal shot. However, there exists also a version that his essays, exposing the hidden insidious intentions of the rulers of his day, led to his assassination.

M. Forster (1938).  Forster's essay (1938)  E. M. Forster says that he does not believe in creeds; but there are so many around that one has to formulate a creed of one‚Äôs own in self-defense. Three values are important to Forster: tolerance, good temper and sympathy. It was first published in Nation on July 16, 1938. Hogarth Press republished it for general sale in 1939. = Personal relationships and the state = Forster argues that one should invest in personal relationships: \\"one must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life\\". In order to do so, one must be reliable in one's relationships. Reliability, in turn, is impossible without natural warmth. Forster contrasts personal relationships with causes, which he hates. In an often quoted sentence he argues: \\"If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country\\". He goes on to explain: > Such a choice may scandalize the modern reader, and he may stretch out his > patriotic hand to the telephone at once and ring up the police. It would not > have shocked Dante, though. Dante places Brutus and Cassius in the lowest > circle of Hell because they had chosen to betray their friend Julius Caesar > rather than their country Rome. = Democracy = Forster cautiously welcomes democracy for two reasons: * It places importance on the individual (at least more than authoritarian regimes). * It allows criticism. Thus, he calls for \\"two cheers for democracy\\" (also the title of the book which contains his essay) but argues that this is \\"quite enough\\" and that \\"there is no occasion to give three.\\" Forster goes on to argue that, although the state ultimately rests on force, the intervals between the use of force are what makes life worth living. Some people may call the absence of force decadence; Forster prefers to call it civilization. = Great men, Forster's aristocracy and public life = Forster also criticises hero-worship and profoundly distrusts so-called \\"great men\\". Heroes are necessary to run an authoritarian regime in order to make it seem less dull \\"much as plums have to be put into a bad pudding to make it palatable\\". As a contrast Forster believes in an \\"aristocracy\\", not based on rank or influence but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the considerate and the plucky. For Forster it is a tragedy that no way has been found to transmit private decencies into public life: > The more highly public life is organized the lower does its morality sink; > the nations of today behave to each other worse than they ever did in the > past, they cheat, rob, bully and bluff, make war without notice, and kill as > many women and children as possible; whereas primitive tribes were at all > events restrained by taboos. It is a humiliating outlook‚Äîthough the greater > the darkness, the brighter shine the little lights, reassuring one another, > signalling: \\"Well, at all events, I'm still here. I don't like it very much, > but how are you?\\" = Individualism = Forster concludes by stating that these \\"are the reflections of an individualist and a liberal\\" who has \\"found liberalism crumbling beneath him\\", taking comfort from the fact that people are born separately and die separately. Therefore, no dictator will be able to eradicate individualism. Forster did not consider himself a visionary. References  Bibliography  *Forster's \\"What I Believe\\" is published in: Forster, E.

In the article she expresses her support to the 'Together Facing the New Totalitarianism' Manifesto, which was published in the left-leaning French weekly Charlie Hebdo in March 2006.\\"Contra el totalitarismo isl√°mico\\", Cristina Peri Rossi, 14 March 2006: http://www.almendron.com/tribuna/?p=2629 Peri Rossi maintains a website at http://www.cristinaperirossi.es/  Literary criticism  She is part of the Boom literary movement. La nave de los locos (The Ship of Fools) (1984) is generally regarded by critics as Peri Rossi's most important work. It is an experimental novel which takes the form of a pastiche of travel writing. The protagonist, Equis, is a misfit who travels to a number of deliberately vague locations. By inviting the reader to see modern society through the eyes of Equis, Peri Rossi is using the technique of defamiliarisation to produce a biting satire of today's world. This includes a strong dose of feminism: Equis eventually renounces his own sexuality, declaring that there is \\"harmony in impotence,\\" which can be read as a denouncement of patriarchial and phallogocentric society. More generally, the work shows toleration and arguably even idealisation of sexualities that have been traditionally considered dissident, including gerontophilia and controversially, in the character Morris' love for a ten-year-old boy, pedophilia. The novel exposes the dangers of arbitrary dictatorial government in its inclusion an emotional depiction of a concentration camp in a country which remains unspecified, but which could be based on any of the various Latin American dictatorships of the latter half of the twentieth century. The title of the book is taken from the Ship of Fools legend, which is reworked by Peri Rossi in the novel itself. The novel shows sympathy for those condemned to the ship of fools and there is a clear parallel between this medieval episode and the modern-day aforementioned concentration camp passage. The themes established in La nave de los locos are ones which Rossi revisits in other works. Her latest novels include Solitario de amor (Solitaire of Love) (1989), La √∫ltima noche de Dostoievski (Dostoyevsky's Last Night) (1992) and El amor es una droga dura (Love is a hard drug) (1999). All of these novels are formally less experimental than Nave. They deal with male protagonists who, like Equis, gradually explore their sexualities, discovering that they have to renounce traditional gender roles both in sexual behaviour and in the real world to find fulfilment. However, there is little political commentary in these novels. Peri Rossi has also produced an impressive amount of poetry, again covering many of the ideas outlined above. The lesbian eroticism of Evoh√© (1971) caused a scandal when first released. In 2004, Peri Rossi published Por fin solos, a collection of short stories where love is a result of eroticism and frustration. The lovers, whatever their condition or sex, seek a reason in the beloved so that they may feel saved, as is the case in \\"N√°ufragos\\". Peri Rossi also uses (determinedly) symbols that link with the deterioration of heterosexual relationships, such as the bottle of lye, the scarf, and flowers, among others. Peri Rossi's book Estrategias del Deseo, which was also published in 2004, was found so moving and inspiring by Latina lesbian writer tatiana de la tierra that de la tierra decided to translate the book to English (Strategies of Desire).

Mirroring tabloid styles in other countries, the paper is known for its mix of sensationalism, scandal, and frequent nudity. The paper has received the ire of the Ugandan government for publishing conspiracy theories relating to the death of Sudan's Vice President John Garang in a helicopter crash and revealing that former foreign minister James Wapakhabulo died of AIDS. In August 2006, Red Pepper published the first names and occupations of prominent Ugandan men whom it asserted were gay. This decision was sharply criticized by Human Rights Watch, which said that the publishing could have exposed the men to government harassment because homosexuality in Uganda remained illegal. The following month, Red Pepper published a similar list of 13 women whom it claimed were lesbians. In an interview published in May 2009, the news editor of Red Pepper, Ben Byarabaha, vowed that the tabloid would continue its campaign against alleged homosexuals by publishing their names, photographs, and addresses. In September 2012, the newspaper was sued about its published nude photo of an herbalist.

In 2004, SouthTrust reached an agreement to merge with Wachovia in a stock-for-stock deal. At the time of the merger with Wachovia was completed, SouthTrust had $53 Billion in assets. SouthTrust was listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol SOTR. The Company was headquartered in the SouthTrust Tower, now known as the Shipt Tower. SouthTrust had branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. By the end of 2005, all former SouthTrust branches that remained open carried the Wachovia name. History =1887 to 1980= SouthTrust Corporation began as Birmingham Trust and Savings Company in 1887. In 1946 the bank sought a charter to become a national bank. After receiving the charter, the name of the bank changed to Birmingham Trust National Bank, which was commonly known as BTNB. In 1972 BTNB combined with three other Alabama banks to become the Alabama Financial Group, Inc. which was a holding company for the four banks. In 1974 the holding company changed its name to Southern Bancorporation of Alabama. Through the rest of the 1970s, Southern Bank continued buying other community banks located throughout Alabama. By this time Southern Bank held assets of over $1 billion. =1981 to 1987= In 1981 the holding company again changed its name, this time to SouthTrust Corporation. In 1986, SouthTrust decided to build a new building for its headquarters in downtown Birmingham. Work began right away on what would become the 34 story SouthTrust Tower. SouthTrust had $5.3 billion in assets by the end of 1986 and had expanded as much as it could in its home state of Alabama. After a change in an Alabama law allowed banks to buy other banks in the 12 southeastern states, SouthTrust made its first purchase outside of Alabama. In 1987 SouthTrust purchased the Central Bank of South Daytona Beach located in Daytona Beach, Florida. SouthTrust quickly focused on Florida for its new acquisitions and acquired many banks, mostly located in northern and Central Florida. Towards the end of 1987 SouthTrust made its first entry into the Georgia market when it moved the SouthTrust National Bank of Russell County headquarters across the state line to Columbus, Georgia. =1988 to 1997= When the bank decided it was time to enter the Tennessee market, it did so by opening up a branch instead of buying a bank already established there. The first Tennessee branch was located in Nashville. By the end of 1989, SouthTrust opened its first South Carolina branch, located in Charleston. As 1990 came around, SouthTrust had grown to over $7.5 billion in assets and had become the largest bank in Alabama. By 1991 SouthTrust had entered the North Carolina market when it bought Barclays' small American operation based in Charlotte. By 1992 SouthTrust had $12 billion in assets and 336 banking branches in six states, but announced that instead of looking to grow geographical wise that it would instead focus on growing in its existing markets. By the end of 1993, SouthTrust's assets had grown to $15.1 billion. In 1994 SouthTrust made its first entry into Mississippi when it purchased First Jefferson Corporation. This purchase helped added to an increase in SouthTrust branch number which had grown to over 400. In 1995, SouthTrust acquired Bankers First Corporation (Nasdaq: BNKF), which was the parent of Bankers First Federal Savings and Loan. Two big changes came in 1996. The first was that all SouthTrust banks would merge under one national bank charter. The second was SouthTrusts entry into life insurance through SouthTrust Insurance, Inc. By end of 1997, SouthTrust entered the state of Texas through when it bought SecurityBank Texas. =1998 to 2005= The late 1990s proved to be one of the most important times in SouthTrust's 118-year history. The bank had become one of the largest banks in the south. Birmingham had grown into the largest banking city in the south based on the number of top 50 US banks headquartered there, although not the largest by assets. In Birmingham, AmSouth Bancorporation, Compass Bancshares, Regions Financial Corporation and SouthTrust all became known as the Big Four. All four banks were top 50 US banks and all headquartered in downtown Birmingham. Only New York City had more banks and no other city equaled with Birmingham. In 2000 the bank made a change from being a nationally chartered bank to a state chartered bank. In 2001, SouthTrust made its first entry into the Virginia banking market when it purchased CENIT Bank. Later that same year, SouthTrust expanded in Virginia when it bought the Bank of Tidewater. From the end of 2001 to 2003, SouthTrust continued making acquisitions by buying small banks in markets in which they already operated so that it could grow its customer base. By the end of 2004, SouthTrust had $53 billion in assets and 712 branches in nine states. Merger with Wachovia On Monday June 21, 2004 Wachovia Corporation announced it would buy SouthTrust in an all-stock transaction valued at $14.3 billion. The merger closed on November 1, 2004. The Birmingham market was the last market for the conversion to the Wachovia brand which occurred in October 2005. =Criticism= About a year before the merger was announced, Wallace Malone, the company's CEO, quietly moved SouthTrust's commercial banking division headquarters from Birmingham to Atlanta. When the public found out, Malone quickly assured the city and employees that SouthTrust's corporate headquarters would remain in Birmingham. Soon after, when Malone was asked in a local newspaper whether he would ever consider selling the bank in the future, he responded by saying he believed SouthTrust was better on its own than combined with any other bank. Even within the company, he strongly preached to employees that the bank would stay independent. This caused residents of Birmingham to be blindsided when the news that SouthTrust had reached a deal to sell itself to Wachovia was announced. The biggest loss to Birmingham came from SouthTrust moving its commercial banking division to Atlanta a year before the merger was announced, and that Atlanta, not Birmingham, would end up with Wachovia's Southern Banking Group headquarters. Around 1,700 of the 4,000 local SouthTrust jobs were lost in Birmingham due to the merger. Many former SouthTrust Customers have defected to banks like Regions and BBVA Compass. Malone's golden parachute When the merger was completed, Malone's $100 million Golden Parachute went into effect. The New York Times put this figure closer to $135 million. Malone has stated that somewhere around 40% of that total will go into a trust for the families affected by the SouthTrust-Wachovia merger, although nothing further has been mentioned yet regarding this matter. Trademark acquisition In 2013, First National Bank of George West, based in south Texas acquired the rights to the name SouthTrust Bank. The new SouthTrust Bank is not affiliated with the original SouthTrust Bank of Alabama, acquiring only the trademark rights to the name as an effort to distinguish their brand amongst other national banks. The new SouthTrust Bank will offer financial services in various Texas markets including Floresville, TX, Houston, TX, San Antonio, TX, Three Rivers, TX, Pleasanton, TX, and George West, TX.

Geography Located south-east of Beirut, the region comprises a narrow coastal strip notable for the Christian town of Damour, and the valleys and mountains of the western slopes of Jabal Barouk, the name of the local Mount Lebanon massif, on which the largest forest of Cedars of Lebanon is found. History Remains of a palace in Baadar√¢ne, Chouf, Lebanon The Emirs of Lebanon used to have their residence in Chouf, most notably Bachir Chehab II, who built the magnificent palace of Beiteddine during the first half of the 19th century. Another historical town, just facing Beiteddine, is Deir al Qamar (the monastery of the Moon). Chouf is the heartland of the Lebanese Druze community, with Druze leader Walid Jumblatt residing at the Jumblatt palace in the town of Moukhtara. Several violent clashes have occurred between Druze and Christians, as in 1848, 1860 and most recently 1983-1984, during the Lebanese Civil War (Mountain War, Arabic: Harb el-Jabal). Reconciliation between the Druze and Christian communities came to fruition on August 8, 2001, when the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir made a historic visit to the Chouf and met with the Druze and Chouf leader, Walid Jumblatt. The Chouf is one of the best- preserved Lebanese districts and its nature has been generally spared from the intense building of neighboring Metn and Kesrouan. Demographics Despite the historical feuds between Christian Maronites and Druze, the Chouf district is still one of the most religiously diverse regions in Lebanon. Currently the region hosts equal proportions of Druze, Sunni Muslims, and Christians (Maronite and Greek Catholic) populations. The Druze and Sunnis each make up 30% of the population, and the remaining 40% is Christian.

NSWBC is made up of current and former employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Reserve, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of State, and others. The organization has collectively testified before Congressional committees in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to demand that Congress act to end government retaliation against those who expose corruption, misdeeds and errors in the realm of U.S. national security. Coalition objectives The NSWBC aims to aid and abet whistleblowers seeking to inform authorities of security vulnerabilities of US intelligence agencies, to counteract the intimidation of employees and the undermining of whistleblower credibility, and to uncover government waste, fraud, abuse and criminal conduct. The coalition is only for whistleblowers who have raised national security issues, not for government workers who have complaints that they were individually discriminated against or wrongly passed over for a promotion. Congressional action On March 15, 2005, H.R. 1317, the Federal Employees Protection of Disclosures Act, was introduced by Rep. Todd Platts R-PA as a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was redrafted to incorporate some minor phrasing adjustments and was reintroduced as H.R. 3097 on June 28, 2005. It was immediately referred to the House Committee on Government Reform, but as of mid-2007, no further action had been taken on the redraft. On June 29, 2006, H.R. 1317 was referred to the House Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and to the House Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight. Both committees granted extensions for further consideration of the bill, with the last one being a three-week extension granted on November 17, 2006 by the House Committee on Armed Services. The Homeland Security committee was discharged the same day. As of mid-2007, no further action had been taken. If enacted as law, the bill would clarify the categories of disclosure covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act, reduce the standard of proof of illicit activity that a whistleblower needs to have before they are entitled to the law's protection, outlaw non- disclosure agreements for federal employees that do not include exemptions for whistleblowers, or that limit other disclosures allowed under open government legislation, and increase the burden of proof needed to discipline managers who allegedly retaliate against those making disclosures. The bill also calls for a study of security clearance revocations to be conducted and a report on the study delivered to the House Committee on Government Reform. In a letter to the NSWBC, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) praised the coalition and pledged his support for legislation protecting national security whistleblowers: > Let me state unequivocally that all federal government workers deserve > whistleblower protection, none more so than national security > whistleblowers. ... Our own government has concluded that they can be > trusted to work on the most important law enforcement and intelligence > projects in today's post-9/11 environment. These officials are critical to > our national defense. ... For these reasons, I favor expanding the > Whistleblower Protection Act to cover these employees and contractors as > fully as possible, as well as making the retaliatory revocation of a > security clearance a prohibited personnel practice.

The Caucus is dedicated to voicing and advancing, through the legislative process, issues affecting Hispanics and Latinos in the United States. The CHC was founded in December 1976 as a legislative service organization of the United States House of Representatives. CHC legislative priorities cover all areas that have a direct impact on the Hispanic or Latino community. In order to best address these diverse issues, members work in smaller task forces that draw on their expertise and develop priority legislation within each area. Today, the CHC is organized as a Congressional Member organization, governed under the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives. The CHC is currently composed entirely of Democrats, although it had been a bipartisan organization since its founding. The Republican members left in the late 1990s over policy differences and, in 2003, formed their own group, the Congressional Hispanic Conference. In 2017, the Caucus declined to admit Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who would have been the only Republican member.  Purpose  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus aims to address national and international issues and the impact these policies have on the Hispanic community. The function of the Caucus is to serve as a forum for the Hispanic and other Members of Congress to coalesce around a collective legislative agenda. In addition to covering legislative action, the CHC also monitors executive and judicial issues at the federal level. Senator Bob Menendez, a Cuban American Democrat from New Jersey, and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Mexican American Democrat from Nevada are currently the only members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from the Senate.  History  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) was organized in 1976 by five Hispanic Congressmen: Herman Badillo (NY), Baltasar Corrada del R√≠o (PR), Kika de la Garza (TX), Henry B. Gonzalez (TX) and Edward Roybal (CA), to serve as a legislative organization through which legislative action, as well as executive and judicial actions, could be monitored to ensure the needs of Hispanics were being met. It was staffed by Raquel Marquez Frankel, who had grown up in Silver City and Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had become, in 1947, the first Latina to attend the University of New Mexico School of Law. The goal was to work in conjunction with other groups, both inside and outside Congress, to strengthen Federal commitment to Hispanics and heighten the community's awareness of the operation and function of the American political system.

Joe Baca had called Rep. Loretta Sanchez a \\"whore\\" in a conversation with Speaker of the California Assembly Fabian N√∫√±ez, prompting Sanchez to resign from the CHC. Rep. Baca has denied this charge, but two other CHC members, Linda S√°nchez (Loretta's sister) and Hilda Solis, expressed support for Loretta Sanchez. In the case of Solis, Baca called her \\"a kiss-up to Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\\" for which he has apologized to Solis both privately and publicly. A year prior to the \\"whore\\" incident, The CHC's political action committee gave $3,000 to Baca's children's campaigns for state offices in California. Although Baca recused himself from the decision to make the contributions, six members of the caucus criticized the decision, saying that CHC's PAC should support only federal candidates. Consequently, on November 15, 2006, when Joe Baca was elected chair of the CHC, Solis and the Sanchez sisters challenged his election, saying that the voting should have been done by a secret ballot. On Monday, April 2, 2007, Congresswoman Linda S√°nchez closed her offices in honor of C√©sar Estrada Ch√°vez Day, a state holiday in California (which fell on a Saturday that year). CHC chair Baca made the following comment on S√°nchez's decision to close the office: \\"I believe the best way to observe C√©sar Estrada Ch√°vez Day is not by taking the day off from work or school.\\" On April 12, Linda S√°nchez announced that she had suspended her membership in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, citing \\"a need for structural reforms to ensure that the caucus is more equitable and inclusive of all its members.\\" She specifically stated that her decision \\"was not based on personal animus directed at Baca.\\" On June 30, 2013, Congressman Filemon Vela, Jr. resigned from the CHC, citing opposition to the Senate immigration bill which the CHC endorsed, saying: \\"Opponents of serious immigration reform are extracting a pound of flesh in this process by conditioning a pathway to citizenship on the construction of more ineffective border fence.\\" The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has received support over the years from Mexican billionaire Ricardo Pliego and Azteca America. Andres Ramirez, a Nevada political consultant, and Kevin de Leon, the President Pro Tempore of the California State Senate, have worked together to route money from Azteca America to various caucus groups and political campaigns, as Pliego is a known rival to Carlos Slim, whom both de Leon and Ramirez have attacked through the use of phony groups such as \\"Two Countries One Voice\\". Ramirez has appeared at functions for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The effort to recruit past students and fellows involved in programs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has caused some political bloggers to speculate over the effort by California State Senator de Leon and his colleague California State Senator Jim Beall to use their legislative staffs, some of whom have been involved in programs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to take over several local groups of California Democratic Party State Central Committee delegations for the purpose of establishing control for de Leon and his allies. In November 2017, the caucus refused to admit Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo, who would have been the only Republican in the caucus.  Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute  In October 1981, the House Committee on House Administration drafted new regulations stipulating that fundraising activities were to be moved off all government premises. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus decided to maintain a legislative support organization on Capitol Hill, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and moved the non-profit, fundraising organization, today known as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Inc. to a new residence.

DM belongs to the group of chemical warfare agents known as vomiting agents or sneeze gases. First synthesized in Germany by Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1915, it was independently developed by the US chemist Roger Adams (for whom it is named) at the University of Illinois in 1918. Composition DM is an odourless crystalline compound with a very low vapour pressure. The colour of the crystals ranges from bright yellow to dark green depending on the purity. It is readily soluble in some organic solvents (e.g., acetone, dichloromethane), but nearly insoluble in water. In vaporous form it appears as a canary yellow smoke.Adamsite (DM) Vomiting Agent. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 22, 2008. Retrieved December 22, 2008. Effects Adamsite is usually dispersed as an aerosol, making the upper respiratory tract the primary site of action. Although the effects are similar to those caused by typical riot control agents (e.g. CS), they are slower in onset but longer in duration, often lasting for 12 or more hours. After a latency period of 5‚Äì10 minutes irritation of the eyes, lungs and mucous membranes develops followed by headache, nausea and persistent vomiting.Committee on Review and Evaluation of the Army Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel Disposal Program, U.S. National Research Council. Disposal of Chemical Agent Identification Sets, (Google Books), p. 15, National Academies Press, 1999, (). Usage DM was produced and stockpiled by the British and the United States at the end of World War I. It was used by the British during the incursions at Murmansk and Archangel.When Chemical Weapons Were First Dropped From the Air, North Russia 1919 Simon Jones. Imperial War Museum Review. No. 12, 1999. Retrieved September 3, 2015. It is now regarded as obsolete and has been widely replaced by riot control agents such as CS which are less toxic and more rapid in the onset of symptoms. Early battlefield use was intended to be via \\"Adamsite candles\\". These were large metal cans or tubes (weighing approximately 5 pounds) which contained a smoke composition made of Adamsite plus a slow burning pyrotechnic composition. A series of candles were lit and the Adamsite-laden smoke allowed to drift towards the enemy. In the United States, it was used against the Bonus Army who demonstrated in Washington, DC, in 1932, reportedly causing the death and serious injury of several children who had accompanied their parents on the protests. It was again used in the Vietnam War.

The series is set in Puzzleopolis, a town inhabited by walking, talking sponge-balls, dice, magic wands, playing cards and rabbits, where the protagonists must solve puzzles. Wizbit's year-and-a-day mission is to find out all about planet Earth. The show is partly educational, with the (often lateral thinking) puzzles Wizbit is set often being presented to the audience at home, with the solutions being revealed towards the end of the episode.

The show was created by Barry Murray, who had formerly been Mungo Jerry's record producer, with assistance from Daniels. Its theme tune is based on a song by Lead Belly, named \\"Ha-Ha This A Way\\", sung by Daniels. All rights to characters and designs were retained by Daniels, and the music rights by Murray. A CGI revival of the series was announced in 2009 with a movie set for Summer 2010, but they were both cancelled. Books based on said revival have been released however.

The angle between the sun and the local horizontal level is exactly 90¬∞ at the subsolar point. The subsolar point on a planet is the point at which its sun is perceived to be directly overhead (at the zenith); that is, where the sun's rays strike the planet exactly perpendicular to its surface. It can also mean the point closest to the sun on an astronomical object, even though the sun might not be visible. To an observer on a planet with an orientation and rotation similar to those of Earth, the subsolar point will appear to move westward, completing one circuit around the globe each day, approximately moving along the equator. However, it will also move north and south between the tropics over the course of a year, so it is spiraling like a helix.

Since none of the bishops joined the Old Believers movement after the schism of 1666-67 in the Russian Orthodox Church, except bishop Paul of Kolomna, who was executed, ordained priests of the old rite would have soon become extinct. Two responses appeared to this dilemma: the ‚Äúpriestist‚Äù Old Believers (–ø–æ–ø–æ–≤—Ü—ã (Popovtsy)) and the non- priestist Old Believers (–±–µ—Å–ø–æ–ø–æ–≤—Ü—ã (Bespopovtsy)). The Beglopopovtsy movement formed in the late 17th century and included priests, who had \\"deserted\\" the Russian Orthodox Church (hence, the name \\"beglopopovtsy\\", meaning \\"with deserted priests\\"). They settled in the Nizhny Novgorod region beyond the Volga River (along the Kerzhenets and Belbash Rivers), around Starodub, Chernigov (modern Chernihiv, Ukraine), and on the Vetka Island (see Vetkovskoye soglasie). In the second half of the 18th century, the Beglopopovtsy formed a group at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. At the beginning, all priestist Old Believers were beglopopovtsy. They represented the more moderate conservative opposition, who strove to continue religious and church life as it had existed before the reforms of Nikon. They recognized ordained priests from the new style Russian Orthodox church who joined the Old Believers and who had denounced the Nikonian reforms. In 1846 the priestist Old Believers convinced Amvrosii (Popovich, 1791-1863) deposed Greek Orthodox bishop (who had been removed under Turkish pressure) to become an Old Believer and to consecrate three Russian Old Believers priests as bishops. In 1859, the number of Old Believer bishops in Russia reached ten, and they established their own episcopate, the so-called Belokrinitskaya hierarchy. Not all priestist Old Believers recognized this new established hierarchy, which provoked a schism within the priestist Old Believers. For various reasons many could not accept this so-called Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy. From this time priestist Old Believers became divided into two groups: those who accepted the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and those who did not. These dissenters were called beglopopovtsy and obtained their own hierarchy only in the 1920s, the so- called Novozybkovskaya Hierarchy or Russian Old-Orthodox Church. From that moment the denomination beglopopovtsy no longer existed and the term became rarely used.

If the estate being administered is that of a deceased person, the personal representative is either an executor if the deceased person left a will or an administrator of an intestate estate.Hayton & Marshall (2005) 1-127-1-128 In other situations, the personal representative may be a guardian or trustee, or other position. As a fiduciary, a personal representative has the duties of loyalty, candor or honesty, and good faith. In the United States, punctilio of honor, or the highest standard of honor, is the level of scrupulousness that a fiduciary must abide by.Meinhard v. Salmon, 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928). In either case of a deceased estate, a probate court of competent jurisdiction issues a finding of fact, including that a will has or has not been filed, and that an executor or administrator has been appointed. These are often referred to as \\"letters testamentary\\", \\"letters of administration\\" or \\"letters of representation\\", as the case may be. These documents, with the appropriate death certificate, are often the only license a person needs to do the banking, stock trading, real estate transactions, and other actions necessary to marshal and dispose of the deceased's estate in the name of the estate itself. Types There are a number of types of personal representatives, including: * Administrator * Administrator de bonis non - one acting without complete authority * Alternate executor * Ancillary administrator * Conservator * Executor or executrix (term for females) * Legal guardian * Overseer - an assistant to an executor, now mostly obsolete * Public administrator U.S. Department of Defense In the U.S., the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants appointed a Personal Representative (CSRT) to meet with each captive who was still being held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba, in August 2004, when the Supreme Court forced the Department of Defense to start convening Combatant Status Review Tribunals.

The series began as a response to the popularity of the wave of anthropomorphic character titles that began with the publishing of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1984. That title, itself a parody of popular comic books at the time such as Daredevil, inspired numerous knock-offs and parodies like Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters, Pre- Teen Dirty-Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos, Mildy Microwaved Pre-Pubescent Kung Fu Gophers and Geriatric Gangrene Jujitsu Gerbils which led to what many refer to as the Black-and-White Boom of the mid-1980s. The Boris character started as bear who was tired of these comic books and decides to kill them in a hyper- violent style reminiscent of 1980s films such as Rambo. After the first issue, Boris the Bear continued to fight parodies of the Transformers, Marvel Comics, Swamp Thing, and Elfquest before moving on to more character-driven stories. Publication history Starting in July 1986 and created by James Dean Smith and written by Mike Richardson and Randy Stradley, Boris the Bear was the second title published by Dark Horse Comics. Telling the story of an anthropomorphic bear, who is soon revealed to be a robot, the book parodied many other comic book characters while also satirizing the comic book industry as a whole. Often extremely violent, the book was a black comedy that developed a cult following. The title also served as the introduction to Wacky Squirrel, created by Mike Richardson and Jim Bradrick, who gained his own popularity and went on to star in his own series and specials published by Dark Horse. Early issues of Boris the Bear centered on parodies of industry trends at the time. For example, the first issue, titled Boris the Bear Slaughters the Teenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters features Boris disposing of characters resembling the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Usagi Yojimbo, Cerebus the Aardvark, the Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters, Hamster Vice, and others in an extremely violent matter. The trend continued through the early issues of the title with Boris confronting or parodying characters resembling the Transformers, the heroes of the Marvel Universe, Swamp Thing, Batman, and Elfquest. It wasn‚Äôt long before Boris even met the actual T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents. The popularity of Boris led to two early appearances in the third and fourth issues of the first volume of Dark Horse Presents as well as full color reprints of the first three issues of his own book, under the title, Boris the Bear Instant Color Classics. The character‚Äôs popularity also led to parodies of Boris himself and ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù stories appearing in titles such as Blackthorne Publishing‚Äôs Laffin‚Äô Gas, Slave Labor Graphics' Samurai Penguin and Eclipse Comics‚Äô Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters. In 1987, a disagreement with Dark Horse, over the direction of the title, convinced Smith to take Boris back from Dark Horse after the twelfth issue, and begin self-publishing the book under his own Nicotat Comics banner. The book picked up with the thirteenth issue, one month after the departure from Dark Horse. Nine months later, Nicotat introduced what was intended to be an ongoing second title, Boris‚Äô Adventure Magazine. The original Boris continued to parody other comic books, although in a less vicious way, while also maturing into more of a somewhat serious adventure title. As the title changed and the book began shipping more and more infrequently, readership dropped and sales decreased. Eventually, despite Smith having the title plotted through the fortieth issue, Nicotat ended its run with the thirty-fourth issue in November, 1991. In 1992, Boris briefly returned to Dark Horse with a short story in the sixty-fourth issue of Dark Horse Presents. In July, 1996, Nicotat returned to the Boris character with a second issue of Boris‚Äô Adventure Magazine. The title ran bi-monthly for two more issues, through November, 1996. Solicitations for the fifth and sixth issues were sent to retailers but the actual issues were never published. The book was officially canceled in 1997. In April, 2007 James Dean Smith began self-publishing again under the name Oasis Comics. Smith handled writing, art, lettering, editing and production chores on a brand new Boris the Bear title that began with a new first issue. Boris The Bear: A Fall Into Spring Special followed in 2008.

Geography  Busswil is located on the old Aare river, the part of the Aar river that still flows from Aarberg to B√ºren after the river was corrected in the 19th century to stop the flooding which had been completely inundating Busswil since ancient times. In those days the Celts from neighbouring villages to the north used the \\"Obererer Weg\\" to travel to the market town of Lyss. Also of note is the ancient oak tree in the middle of a field next to the L√§nggasse, at which Napoleon is said to have rested with his troops on the way back from his Austrian campagne. Busswil has a bakery, a post office, two small supermarkets (Co-Op and Denner), a tea- room, a hotel (R√∂ssli), restaurant (Bahnhof), and a railway station. The neighbouring municipalities are B√ºetigen, Worben, Studen and Lyss. Busswil bei B√ºren has an area, , of . Of this area, or 51.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 28.5% is forested.

Of the agricultural land, 44.6% is used for growing crops and 5.6% is pastures, while 1.3% is used for orchards or vine crops. Most of the water in the municipality is in rivers, streams or underground springs of excellent quality (used as drinking water by several houses along the L√§nggasse) but the springs will also soon be destroyed by the extension of the above-mentioned Vigier Beton gravel and sand excavations.

Chemically, it is the sodium salt of erythorbic acid. When used in processed meat such as hot dogs and beef sticks, it increases the rate at which nitrite reduces to nitric oxide, thus facilitating a faster cure and retaining the pink coloring. As an antioxidant structurally related to vitamin C, it helps improve flavor stability and prevents the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. When used as a food additive, its E number is E316.Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers, Food Standards Agency The use of erythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate as a food preservative has increased greatly since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of sulfites as preservatives in foods intended to be eaten fresh (such as ingredients for fresh salads) and as food processors have responded to the fact that some people are allergic to sulfites. It can also be found in bologna, and is occasionally used in beverages, baked goods, and potato salad. Sodium erythorbate is produced from sugars derived from different sources, such as beets, sugar cane, and corn. An urban myth claims that sodium erythorbate is made from ground earthworms; however, there is no truth to the myth.Sodium Erythorbate - is it an earthworm?, Oregon Department of Agriculture It is thought that the origin of the legend comes from the similarity of the chemical name to the words earthworm and bait.

Prior to that, he represented Samia-Bugwe North, Busia District in the Ugandan Parliament from 2001 until 2006. Awori was an outspoken opposition member of parliament for the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) political party. In 2007, he abandoned the UPC and joined the ruling National Resistance Movement. Background Awori was born on 23 February 1939, in Budimo Village, Busia District, near the Ugandan/Kenyan border as the tenth of seventeen children. His parents were Canon Jeremiah Musungu Awori, a pioneer African priest of the Anglican Church in East Africa and Mrs. Mariamu Odongo Awori, a nurse and community teacher. Aggrey's siblings include the ninth Kenyan vice-president Arthur Moody Awori and Mary Okelo, the first woman in East Africa to head a Barclays Bank branch and the founder of Kenya's women only bank; the Kenya Women Finance Trust. Mary is also the founder of Makini Schools, a leading school chain in East Africa. He owns an urban home in Busia Municipality and a country home in neighboring Bugiri District. Education He attended Nabumali High School in Mbale District and King's College Budo, in Wakiso District, both in Uganda. While at Kings College Budo (1959 to 1961), Aggrey was selected among a few others for elite military officers training at Sandhurst Military College in the United Kingdom. His father Canon Awori, however, rejected the idea of his talented son joining the military. From 1961 to 1965, he studied at Harvard University on a scholarship. The first year he took nuclear physics, but then switched over to political economics. While at Harvard, Aggrey became the first person in heptagonal track history to win three events - the long jump, high hurdles, and 60-yard dash, tying the heps record in the hurdles and setting the mark in the dash. He also ran on the victorious mile relay team that tied the heptagonal record. By the time he graduated from Harvard, Awori held three outdoor and five indoor school records. He also represented Uganda in the 110 metres hurdles at the 1960 Summer Olympics and the 1964 Summer Olympics, but failed to win any medals. Awori has a Master of Arts in economics from Syracuse University in the U.S. Career In 1967, Awori was appointed the first local director of Uganda Television (UTV). In 1971 Awori was jailed for two months after Idi Amin's coup, because during Amin's first coup attempt he didn't broadcast a speech Amin gave, lying to him by saying that they were live on air. He went into political exile in Kenya, where he taught at the University of Nairobi until 1976 and then traveled around Africa visiting Tanzania, Liberia and Senegal and returning to Nairobi in 1979. After Idi Amin was overthrown in 1979, Awori returned to Uganda. He ran for a seat in the National Assembly of Uganda, but lost. He then became Ambassador to the United States, until being transferred by Tito Okello Lutwa in 1985. He served as Uganda's Ambassador to Belgium from 1985 until 1987, when he was dropped by Yoweri Museveni. After a brief asylum in Nairobi, Awori started to build up a rebel group operating from eastern Uganda. He stated that his reason for doing so was mainly anger at Museveni's National Resistance Army, which had confiscated his property. In 1992, he dissolved his rebel group, which had consisted mainly of young fighters. In 1993, Awori met with Museveni in New York and then was elected to the Constituent Assembly to make the Constitution and as a member of parliament. He came third in the 2001 presidential elections, polling 1.41% of the vote. He represented Samia-Bugwe North, Busia District in the Ugandan Parliament from 2001 until 2006.

In 2007, he abandoned the UPC and joined the ruling National Resistance Movement political party. He was the Minister for Information & Communications Technology in the Cabinet of Uganda from 16 February 2009 to 27 May 2011. In the cabinet reshuffle of 27 May 2011, he was dropped from the cabinet and replaced by Ruhakana Rugunda. On account of his cabinet post, he was an ex officio Member of the Ugandan Parliament (MP).

In March 1876, He Dog married a young woman named Rock (Inyan) and with part of the Soreback Band, stopped briefly with the Northern Cheyenne encamped on the Powder River in Wyoming Territory.

A German-held salient from Reims to Amiens had been formed in 1914 which menaced communications between Paris and the unoccupied parts of northern France. A reciprocal French advance eastwards in Artois could cut the rail lines supplying the German armies between Arras and Reims. French operations in Artois, Champagne and Alsace from November‚ÄìDecember 1914, led General Joseph Joffre, Generalissimo (Commander in Chief) and head of Grand Quartier G√©n√©ral (GQG), to continue the offensive in Champagne against the German southern rail supply route and to plan an offensive in Artois against the lines from Germany supplying the German armies in the north. Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), co-operated with the French strategy to capture Vimy Ridge by planning British attacks against Aubers Ridge. The attacks would confront the German 6th Army with a joint offensive, on a front, eastwards into the Douai plain, where an advance of would cut the railways supplying the German armies as far south as Reims. The French attacked Vimy Ridge and the British attacked further north in the Battle of Aubers Ridge (9 May) and the Battle of Festubert . The battle was fought during the German offensive of the Second Battle of Ypres , which the Germans ended to reinforce the Artois front. The initial French attack broke through and captured Vimy Ridge but reserve units were not able to reinforce the troops on the ridge before German counter-attacks forced them back about half-way to their jumping-off points. The British attack at Aubers Ridge was a costly failure and two German divisions in reserve were diverted south against the Tenth Army. The British offensive was suspended until 15 May, when the Battle of Festubert began and French attacks from 15 May to 15 June were concentrated on the flanks to create jumping-off points for a second general offensive, which began on 16 June. The British attacks at Festubert forced the Germans back and diverted reserves from the French but the Tenth Army gained little more ground, despite firing double the amount of artillery ammunition and many more casualties on both sides. On 18 June, the main offensive was stopped and local French attacks were ended on 25 June. The French had regained of territory but their failure to capture Vimy Ridge, despite the expenditure of and suffering led to recriminations against Joffre. The defence of the ridge cost the German 6th Army A lull in the area followed until the Third Battle of Artois in September. Background =Strategic developments= After the Marne campaign in 1914, French offensives in Artois, Champagne and at St Mihiel had been costly failures, leading to criticism of the leadership of General Joseph Joffre, within the army and the French government. The French President, Raymond Poincar√©, arranged several meetings between Joffre and the Council of Ministers () in March and April 1915, where reports of the failed operations were debated, particularly a condemnation of the April offensive against the St Mihiel salient. Joffre retained undivided command and freedom to conduct operations as he saw fit, which had been given at the beginning of the war but was instructed to consult with his subordinates; provisional army groups, which had been established in late 1914, were made permanent soon afterwards. The French government accepted that the task facing Joffre and the army was far more difficult than expected, after the winter fighting in Artois and Champagne. Despite costly mistakes, many lessons had been learned, methods had been changed and more weapons and equipment necessary for siege warfare had been delivered. The offensives had failed in their objectives but had become more powerful and better organised, except for the bungled effort at St. Mihiel. The greater amount of heavy artillery gave grounds for confidence, that further attacks could break the German front and liberate France. In late 1914, General Erich Von Falkenhayn, Chief of the General Staff of the German army (OHL) since 14 September, had reinforced the 4th Army and attacked westwards, parallel to the North Sea coast, culminating in the Battle of the Yser and the First Battle of Ypres (), when open warfare in the west ended. Eight new divisions were formed in February 1915 and another fourteen in April, which were formed into a new 11th Army, intended for an offensive in France. Despite the French battle in Champagne in February, Falkenhayn was forced to cancel his plans to attack in the west and send the 11th Army to the Eastern Front, to support the Austro-Hungarian army, which has suffered more than by March 1915. Nine divisions were transferred to Russia in May, which reduced the (Western Army) to against French, British and Belgian divisions. The had and field guns, and heavy guns and ten super-heavy howitzers. A reserve of guns and mortars was also being prepared. OHL had divisions in reserve, with the 58th and 115th divisions behind the 6th Army. Indications of an attack in Artois had been detected but not signs of a general offensive on the Western Front. The was forced to remain on the defensive, except for limited attacks in Flanders, in the Second Battle of Ypres () and in the Argonne west of Verdun until August, to cut the main rail line from Paris to Verdun. In memoranda issued on Falkenhayn ordered that the positions of the German armies in France were to be fortified to resist attacks with only small forces, to enable reserves to be sent to Russia. Should part of the front line be lost, it was to be retaken by counter-attack. Behind the line, new defences were to be built and connected by communication trenches, to delay a further attack, until reserves could be assembled for a counter-attack. Enemy reinforcements were to be obstructed by a shell-barrage (). On 4 May, Falkenhayn reiterated the need to improve reserve positions and also to build a rear position about behind the front line. During 1915, the German armies on the Western Front increased the front line from one to three trenches, built a second trench system behind the front line and developed the defensive use of machine-guns and artillery, to restrict an attack to a bend () in the line. The Franco-British offensives in 1915 found the German defences in a state of continuous development, the building programme taking time to complete, due to a shortage of labour. =Tactical developments= In March 1915, Joffre concluded that a period of inactivity would benefit the Germans more than the French; General Ferdinand Foch, commander of the (GPN), proposed an offensive in which a \\"general action\\" on the Western Front including the British, to confuse the defenders and pin down reserves, would complement a \\"decisive action\\", to break through the German defences at a place where the Germans would not be able to establish a new defensive front by a short retirement. Joffre accepted the proposals on 23 March, with the objective being the seizure of Vimy Ridge and exploitation of the success by an eastwards advance into the Douai plain. The French army had not completed an adaptation to siege warfare and much of the equipment necessary, particularly heavy artillery, did not exist. It had been impossible to synchronise operations in Artois with the First Battle of Champagne, which ended on 17 March. Debate within the army as to means and ends had led to two schools of thought, those who, like Joffre, favoured \\"continuous battle\\" (an attack without pause involving all resources) and advocates of \\"methodical battle\\" like Foch, who wanted to conduct offensives as series of attacks with pauses to reorganise and consolidate. The theoretical bases of the forthcoming French offensive in Artois were collected in (Purpose and Conditions for Comprehensive Offensive Action) 16 April 1915 (and Note 5779) which had been compiled from analyses of reports received from the front since 1914. The document contained instructions on infiltration tactics, \\"rolling\\" barrages and poison gas, which were to be used systematically for the first time. Although doubtful about the capacity of the British to attack, Joffre wanted an offensive on the northern flank of the Tenth Army, to force the Germans to disperse their defences. At a meeting on 29 March, with Sir John French, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and Herbert Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, it was agreed that the IX Corps () and XX Corps would be relieved at Ypres by British units and on 1 April, French agreed to attack at the same time as the Tenth Army. French doubts about the efficiency of the BEF had not diminished after the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and British doubts about the French had increased after the at Ypres on 22 April, when French troops had been routed by a German gas attack; Joffre had to agree to place reserves behind the Ypres front to secure British co-operation. The number of divisions in the German Army was increased over the winter with large intakes of recruits and by reorganising square divisions with twelve battalions (in two brigades with two regiments each) into triangular divisions with one brigade headquarters commanding nine battalions in three regiments. The surplus regiments provided new divisions with a nucleus of trained and experienced troops; smaller divisions made it easier to move them from quiet sectors without undue disruption. On 3 March, Falkenhayn had formed the 11th Army, the (Breakthrough Army) to be the main attacking force on the Western Front. On 30 March, its Chief of Staff, Colonel Hans von Seeckt, recommended an offensive between Arras and Albert, requiring fourteen corps and artillery batteries. An offensive in the west was cancelled in April, due to the deteriorating situation on the Eastern Front, where the Austro-Hungarian Army (/) faced collapse. The 11th Army and other divisions of the were sent east and the initiative in the west was left with the Entente armies. The defences of the German army in the west had been improvised since late 1914 and in many places were vulnerable to the growing number of French heavy guns. During the spring, the began to build defences to a standard system, building a second position behind a barbed wire barricade, far enough behind the first position to require an attacker to pause, to bring field artillery into range. The first position was elaborated into a zone, with camouflaged strong points and machine-gun nests built of concrete behind the front trenches. The 6th Army held a front of from Menin to the south of Arras with thirteen divisions and the 58th and 115th divisions in OHL reserve behind the front. The 6th Army had guns and guns. West of Lille, the front line was in the marshy Flanders plain and south of La Bass√©e, the ground was criss- crossed by waterways and drainage ditches, which made fortification difficult. West of Lens, the high ground of Vimy Ridge and the Lorette Spur dominated the ground further to the west; to the south around Arras the ground was overlooked from the ridge at Thilloy beyond the Scarpe. Prelude = French offensive preparations = Since January French sappers in the Carency area had tunnelled , to plant of explosives in galleries under the German positions. The main French front of attack was from the chapel on the plateau of Notre Dame de Lorette Spur (Lorette spur) south to the \\"\\", a network covering of trenches, tunnels and dug-outs across the Arras‚ÄìLens road north of Ecurie and Roclincourt. The spur was the southern boundary of the plain north of the B√©thune‚ÄìLa Bass√©e Canal, which was long and wooded in parts, except at the east end. From the north the slopes of the ridge were low but on the south side there were steep spurs separated by ravines. West of Ablain St. Nazaire (Ablain) was Spur Mathis and to the east, the Great Spur, the Arabs' Spur, the Spur of the White Way and the Spur of Souchez, which dominated the east edge of Ablain and the sugar refinery between Ablain and Souchez. By 20 March the French had worked their way up to the foot of the Great Spur and by 14 April had closed up to Ablain. General d'Urbal was appointed to the command of the Tenth Army on 2 April, which had six infantry corps, a cavalry corps and three divisions in reserve. On the right (southern) flank was X Corps with the 19th and 20th divisions, the XVII Corps to the left with the 34th and 33rd divisions, XX Corps with the 11th and 39th divisions, XXXIII Corps with the Moroccan, 70th and 77th divisions, XXI Corps with the 13th and 43rd divisions and IX Corps with the 92nd Territorial Division and the 17th and 58th divisions, covering the ground up to the British First Army to the north. The IX Corps and XX Corps had been relieved by the British in Flanders and moved south from 9 to 16 April, although the IX Corps headquarters and the 18th, 152nd and 153rd divisions had to be rushed up to Flanders after the German gas attack at the Second Battle of Ypres Artillery reinforcements increased the quantity of heavy artillery to and field artillery to Increased production of ammunition had not kept pace with demand and the French artillery remained short of high explosive shells; poor quality ammunition also caused a large number of premature detonations in French artillery. =French plan= The Tenth Army was to attack on a front, the main attack being made in the centre by the XVII, XX and XXXIII corps on a front, with supporting attacks along the spur south of Bailleul-Sir-Berthoult and by the XXI Corps with two divisions along the Notre-Dame de Lorette spur. The main attack was to capture Vimy Ridge and then consolidate to prevent German counter-attacks from recapturing the heights. Reserve divisions and cavalry would then begin a pursuit from the ridge into the Douai plain. D'Urbal wanted a four-hour artillery bombardment to surprise the German defenders but this was over-ruled by Foch and Joffre. A four-day bombardment was substituted, based on the experience of the offensives of the winter and early spring (especially the St. Mihiel offensive). Delays in the arrival of artillery led to a postponement of the attack from 1 May until 7 May and the bombardment began on 3 May. Bad weather reduced visibility and the bombardment was extended to six days and on 8 May, the artillery began a destructive bombardment on the German front defences, which were severely damaged. In the last four hours, all of the Tenth Army artillery bombarded the German wire and the first and reserve trench lines, ready for the infantry attack at =German defensive preparations= The German defences had been improved in the ridges, hollows and ravines between Arras and Lens, since the war of movement had ended late in 1914. Barbed wire and chevaux-de-frise obstacles had been placed in front of the German defences and tunnels, caves and trenches, cellars and loopholed buildings had been fortified; avenues of approach were surveyed and registered by the German artillery. The 6th Army had retained most of the plateau of the Lorette Spur and all of the Spur of the White Way and Spur Souchez during the local attacks by the French in March and April. On 9 May, the French line ran about west of the Chapel, to the summit of the Arabs' Spur and by the Great Spur and Spur Mathis, down to the valley west of Ablain. Five German trench lines had been dug from the Arabs' Spur, across the plateau to the Arras‚ÄìB√©thune road near Aix-Noulette. The trench lines were fortified with iron roofs, sandbags, concrete and barbed wire. At every , a machine-gun nest had been built into the trench and small, fortified posts supported the defenders, one to the north-east of the Chapel of Notre Dame de Lorette, with dug-outs over deep. Artillery and machine-guns in Ablain commanded the southern slopes of the ridge and those in Souchez the eastern face of the spur. Guns hidden in Angres and Li√©vin to the north-east of the plateau commanded the approaches from the plain to the north and along the spur. Below the southern side of the Lorette Spur were Ablain, Souchez and a sugar refinery in buildings along a -length of the banks of the St. Nazaire stream, which had been fortified. To the south was Mill Malon and east of the sugar refinery lay marshes. South of Ablain rose wooded heights towards Carency, with the village in a hollow, the houses in five groups, one in the centre and the others facing north, west, south and east, protected by four lines of trenches. Each street and house had been fortified, connected by underground passages and garrisoned with four battalions of infantry and six companies of engineers. Field guns and machine- guns had been dug into the gardens and orchards, as well as behind the church, which made it impossible to attack the village except form the south and east. Trenches connected Carency with Ablain and Souchez on the B√©thune‚ÄìArras road. Between Souchez and Arras at the hamlet of La Targette, the Germans had dug trenches, known as the \\"White Works\\", under which lay a German fortress. To the east of La Targette, was the village of Neuville St. Vaast, long and wide, between the Arras‚ÄìB√©thune and Arras‚ÄìLens roads, which had also been turned into an underground fortress. South of Neuville St. Vaast extended the , on both sides of the Arras‚ÄìLens road, which contained tunnels and small strong points organised in a maze, with frequent blank walls and sally ports for the defenders to appear behind the attackers, linked by tunnels to Neuville St. Vaast. About east of the and Neuville St. Vaast was the edge of the heights bounding the plain between the Scarpe and the B√©thune‚ÄìLa-Bass√©e‚ÄìLille Canal. Opposite the French Tenth Army, the XIV Corps held the front with the 29th and 28th divisions and to the south, I Bavarian Reserve Corps held the line from Souchez to the south bank of the Scarpe at Arras, with the 5th and 1st Bavarian Reserve divisions. After the British attack at Neuve Chapelle, the local attacks which had occurred since December 1914 resumed, which resulted in minor changes of the front line. At the end of April, indications of a bigger attack in preparation and reports of new French units being formed suggested a more ambitious French attack north of Arras. French artillery fire began to increase in May but the weather in Artois was mainly cloudy and overcast, which with French air superiority restricted German air reconnaissance and ground observation of the rear of the French Tenth Army. Infantry patrolling was also inhibited and the presence of the French XVII Corps was not detected until 8 May. An attack on the same day was made on the positions of the 28th Division west of Li√©vin by the French 43rd Division, which was eventually repulsed at great cost to both sides. Battle =First phase, 9‚Äì20 May= Tenth Army The final bombardment began at with registration of targets for an hour. At the mines in the Carency sector and the Lorette Spur were sprung, as an intense bombardment of the first two German positions continued, until a ten-minute pause at followed by a ten- minute hurricane bombardment. As the infantry began their attack, the bombardment changed to a creeping barrage. At the infantry attack began in bright dry weather. Three of the trench lines on the Lorette Spur were captured by Chasseurs and supporting infantry of XXI Corps with many casualties. A fortified post in the centre of the German line was not captured and German artillery near Angres bombarded the lost trenches, as machine-guns in Ablain swept the French infantry. Fighting continued after dark and the French began to dig in. The German front trenches at Carency were captured and against orders, the French tried to continue into the village but fire from a strong point to the east stopped the French advance. XXI Corps had managed to advance through the maze of fortifications on the Lorette Spur and IX Corps beyond made a little progress. On the northern flank of XXXIII Corps, the 70th Division attacked Ablain, Carency and Souchez and strong points at and the sugar refinery. The division reached the fringes of the villages but the repulse of the right-hand regiment led the most advanced troops to withdraw to a line forward of the start-line. In the XXXIII Corps area, the (DM) attacked with two waves of \\"shock troops\\", who were lightly-equipped and pushed forward as quickly as possible, leaving isolated German positions to the (cleaners) following them. The German wire was found to be well cut and by the advanced troops reached point Vimy Ridge and dug in, having made an advance of over , supported soon after by the arrival of machine-gun teams. Divisional reserves were ordered forward at and at d'Urbal ordered the 18th Division to move up but it had been stationed back to be out of German artillery range. Reserve units had great difficulty in advancing through German artillery fire, which left the DM in a narrow salient and under fire from all directions. During the afternoon, the DM was counter-attacked and forced off the ridge, managing to take several guns, machine-guns and prisoners with them. The 77th Division reached Givenchy-en-Gohelle, the cemetery at Souchez, Ch√¢teau de Carleul and took and thirty machine-guns but was soon forced back to the Souchez‚ÄìNeuville road, by German artillery-fire and counter-attacks. The French infantry also suffered many casualties and found that artillery support had diminished, as the field artillery was firing at the limit of its range. German communication trenches between Carency and Souchez were blocked, which cut off Carency except via Ablain. The 39th Division crossed the German trenches in front of La Targette, where two strong points contained artillery but the French advance was so swift, that only a few machine-gunners were able to engage them and the village was captured by being taken. The area was quickly consolidated and French field artillery galloped up to engage German troops nearby. The French pressed on to Neuville and advanced up the southern part of Vimy Ridge but troops of the 11th Division on the right flank, were held up by the defenders of the . In the centre, the French gained a foothold in houses at the south end of the village and near the cemetery and half of the village was captured. On the main front, the French artillery had prepared the way for the infantry and creeping barrages had kept the surviving German infantry pinned down but where the French had fewer heavy guns and ammunition, the attacks had failed. The XVII Corps to the south of the attack front, had been expected to make a deeper advance than the other corps but was stopped by German machine- gun fire in no man's land and was only able to establish small footholds in the first position. In the south of the attack front, the X Corps infantry were stopped in no man's land. By nightfall the Tenth Army had taken ten field guns and fifty machine-guns. The success of XXXIII Corps had used up much of its ammunition and poor-quality shells had caused 24 premature explosions in its guns, against only four knocked out by German counter-battery fire. On 10 May, Joffre and Foch decided that infantry attacks would have to reflect the capacity of the artillery to support them and a proposal by d'Urbal to attack south of Arras was rejected. Joffre ordered several cavalry divisions to move towards the Tenth Army area as a decoy. To keep German reserves pinned down, a feint attack was made north of the Lorette Spur towards Loos, which managed a small advance on the left, until stopped by the fire of German artillery in Angres. On the Lorette Spur, machine-gun fire from a German strong point near the chapel caused many French casualties. A counter-attack from the sugar refinery between Ablain and Souchez was seen assembling and the French attack in the area was suspended. Barrage fire by the French artillery prevented the German infantry from advancing and the French infantry descended from the spur towards the Ablain ravine. The attack on Carency continued and German counter- attacks recovered some of the communication trenches and tunnels connecting it with Souchez. During the day, houses east of the village were stormed and a hollow south of the Carency‚ÄìSouchez road was captured. A lull occurred on the main front as the French infantry reorganised and the surviving German defenders recovered from the effects of the attack. French gunners were hampered (paralysed) by their ignorance of the positions of the infantry and left unable to fire a preparatory bombardment; the gunners concentrated on shelling German reserves seen advancing and on counter-battery fire. The most advanced French infantry were cut off by German barrage-fire, suffered from a serious shortage of water and frequently were counter-attacked, which rapidly reduced their ability to attack again, particularly in the units which had advanced the furthest. To the south of XXXIII Corps, the 39th Division attacked Neuville on the orders of the corps commander, despite the reservations of the divisional and army commanders and suffered a costly repulse by devastating fire from the defenders. On the right, beyond the Arras‚ÄìB√©thune road, Neuville cemetery was taken and counter-attacks by German reserves brought up from Douai and Lens were repulsed. By 11 May, the Tenth Army had reorganised sufficiently to attempt another general offensive but the DM and the 77th Division, which were the most advanced, had received the fewest reinforcements and supplies. Communication with the foremost troops was almost impossible through the German artillery-fire but d'Urbal thought that the German defence was rapidly increasing in effectiveness and that delay would put the French at a greater disadvantage. To the north the 70th Division and the 13th Division of XXI Corps managed to advance at Ablain, Carency, and along the Lorette Spur, which left the German garrison in Ablain outflanked on both sides. The attack by the XXXIII Corps was met by a huge volume of German artillery and small-arms fire and repulsed, DM having suffered since 9 May; the 77th Division also gained little ground due to German flanking fire. On the evening of 11 May, the French captured the lower slopes of the Arabs' Spur in mutually costly fighting and a night counter-attack by German troops from the Spur of the White Way was repulsed. The 13th and 43rd divisions captured the crest of the Lorette Spur during the night, which deprived the Germans of the commanding views from the ridge. German artillery in Angres and the machine-guns in Ablain kept a constant fire on the new French positions. On 11 May, D'Urbal reinforced the XXXIII Corps and XX Corps with fresh divisions, ready to attack after a two-hour bombardment. The French captured the wood east of Carency, which overlooked German communication trenches with Souchez and prevented their use. A German party on a wooded hillock kept the French from the east end of the village and the western approach was blocked by infantry at a stone quarry, nearly deep. To the south, XX Corps made slow progress at Neuville, where the 39th Division held a front with a right-angle facing the western and northern fringes of the village, with the right-hand brigade attacking the village and the left-hand brigade attempting to capture . Every attempt to advance was met with massed artillery-fire. IX Corps on the northern flank, X and XVII corps on the southern flank, made limited attacks, which were mostly repulsed. To the south, the French attack on Neuville and the continued and the cemetery was captured. P√©tain reported that machine-gun fire from both flanks and German artillery-fire had increased, which had caused far more casualties. The result of the attack on 11 May, led d'Urbal to order that the German defences on the flanks at Souchez and Neuville were to be captured, before resuming the attack on Vimy Ridge. XXI Corps was to resume the advance along the Lorette Spur, XXXIII Corps was to capture Carency and then attack Souchez, as XX Corps to the south attacked Neuville. Before dawn on 12 May, French Chasseurs attacked the strong point near the Chapel of Notre Dame de Lorette on the Lorette Spur; after hand-to-hand fighting the strong point and the remains of the Chapel were captured. At dawn, under a German artillery bombardment, the French pushed towards the Spur of the White Way, which commanded the valley from Ablain to Souchez. At Carency, French infantry attacked after a bombardment, captured the wooded hillock east of the village and eventually took the stone quarry to the west. The French entered the western block of houses at the same time and at about of the garrison surrendered. Conditions on the plateau were appalling, because bursting shells had disinterred the corpses of hundreds of French and German soldiers killed before the offensive. The French continued the advance from Carency towards Ablain, which suddenly caught fire, as the Germans withdrew to houses at the eastern fringe of the village. The French took field artillery and machine- guns in the area. On Thursday 13 May, in heavy rain a German counter-attack on the Spur of the White Way was repulsed by machine-gun fire. By the morning of 14 May, the French had captured most of the Lorette Spur and Carency but not the intervening positions, from which flanking fire had stopped the XXXIII Corps from advancing on Souchez. On 15 May, another French attack on the Spur of the White Way failed and until 21 May, the French on the Lorette Spur consolidated, under fire from the German artillery at Angres and Li√©vin. In the valley, the Germans held on at the east end of Ablain and recaptured the church and cemetery. British First Army Two areas of the German front line, on either side of the Neuve Chapelle battlefield, were attacked by the British First Army (General Sir Douglas Haig). In the south I Corps and the Indian Corps attacked on a front from the Rue du Bois and IV Corps attacked in the north on a front opposite Fromelles. The attack was intended to make two breaches in the German defences apart, after which the infantry were to advance to Aubers Ridge about beyond. The preliminary bombardment began on 9 May at and at became intense. Ten minutes later, the infantry attacked and surprised the German defenders, artillery fire cutting all the German telephone lines to the rear. Visibility was poor due to smoke and dust and the bombardment proved less effective than assumed; much of the British shell-fire fell short and few of the German machine-guns were destroyed. German machine- gunners and artillery began to fire at the same time and in ten minutes inflicted many casualties on the British infantry as they advanced across no man's land. The failure of the attack to gain more than a few footholds in the German first line led to a second attack at after a forty-five-minute bombardment, which was repelled in no man's land by German defensive fire. A new attack was ordered for noon but was delayed until about Despite a \\"terrific\\" bombardment, the German machine-gun nests were not destroyed and the machine-gunners stopped the attack with flanking-fire. To assist the French, whose attack had been more successful, another attack was ordered for and then cancelled as it became clear that another attack could not be launched. The extent of the British defeat had not been realised, due to the difficulty of communicating with the front line. The British lost and German casualties had also been severe; the defensive position had been turned into a crater-field but German reserves were moved from the British front to Vimy Ridge on 12 May. Joffre and Foch met French that day to persuade him to resume the attack after the redeployment of German divisions south against the Tenth Army: French agreed to relieve a French division south of La Bass√©e by 15 May. =Second phase, 12 May ‚Äì 12 June= Tenth Army P√©tain proposed a combined attack on Souchez with the divisions of XXXIII and XXI corps for 12 May, which was rejected due to the exhaustion of the XXI Corps divisions. P√©tain substituted a plan for three limited attacks against Carency, Ablain and Souchez, with similar attack in the south against Neuville. Joffre sent the III Corps to the Tenth Army as reinforcement but also had to withdraw artillery to support the British attack due at Festubert. After 11 May, the French consolidated captured positions and moved the supply infrastructure of the army, hospitals, depots, rail lines and headquarters forward. New artillery positions were prepared, ready for operations to secure (\\"jumping- off positions\\"); depleted units were relieved and replacements trained by the survivors. The attacks by the 70th, part of the 77th and the 13th divisions which captured Carency and the chapel on the Lorette Spur, placed the German garrison in Ablain in a salient and forced the Germans to withdraw on 12 May, to a line from Ch√¢teau Carleul to Souchez, the cemetery at Ablain and the sugar refinery. German troops in the remaining positions of the Lorette Spur withdrew to maintain contact with the new defensive positions to the east. On 13 May, the 70th Division cautiously followed up the German retirement and the 77th and 13th divisions made a converging attack on the sugar refinery. Engineers rebuilt trenches in the captured area ready for an attack on Souchez on 14 May. At Neuville the 11th Division and part of the 39th Division attacked again on 12 May, despite the costly failure on 11 May, when some units had casualties. The 39th Division advanced, the infantry moving behind a shower of hand grenades and trench mortar bombs but was forced back when the left-hand regiment was repulsed. The 11th Division was bogged down in Neuville and the . The 39th Division commander, General Nourrisson, objected to the continuation of large attacks but d'Urbal insisted that they continue as new defences were dug and fresh troops were brought forward. Until 15 May large rushed attacks continued, with many failures and a few costly successes. On 15 May a larger general attack was made and was another costly failure. Artillery support was inadequate due to losses from German counter-battery fire and barrel explosions from inferior ammunition. Artillery tactics were unchanged and the density of shell-fire diminished, which gave German reinforcements, which had arrived from 13 to 14 May time to dig in many new machine-guns and meet the attack with massed machine-gun fire supported by a heavy bombardment by the artillery, which stopped the attack as soon as it began. On 18 May, d'Urbal asked for the XVII and X corps to be withdrawn by 24 May because of the costly failure of their attacks but was over-ruled by Foch, who ordered an end to rushed attacks. Foch ordered a pause of eight days, to prepare an attack with the thoroughness of 9 May; in the interim, local attacks were to be made with massed artillery support on limited objectives. Joffre supported the intervention by Foch and also ordered d'Urbal to restrict attacks to piecemeal efforts against local points of tactical importance. Until 15 June the French made many limited attacks on the flanks of the 77th and Moroccan divisions, using the same troops and same tactics. On 23 May the XXI Corps captured the rest of the Lorette Spur and on 27 May the 70th Division took Ablain cemetery, then the sugar refinery on 31 May, which made Souchez vulnerable to an attack from the west as well as the south. The limited narrow-front attacks were much better supported by the artillery. A revised version of Note 5779 was issued on 20 May by GQG, which asserted that the version of 16 April had been vindicated by events. The new version endorsed \\"continuous battle\\" and emphasised that reserves must be pushed forward to avoid the mistake made on 9 May, when they had been held back out of German artillery range. An analysis of German defensive methods, described the use of small numbers of infantry equipped with large numbers of machine-guns, firing from flanks and the sheltering of infantry in deep dug-outs, immune to field artillery; French defensive positions were to be modelled on the German practice. Local attacks were resumed but while modestly successful and remaining within the material constraints on the Tenth Army, were hampered by a drastic loss of experience, caused by the extent of French losses. The tempo of limited attacks was beyond the capacity of the Tenth Army to supply and train replacement soldiers according to the requirements of Note 5779. An attempt to return to larger combined attacks by IX, XXI and XXXIII corps from 25 to 26 May failed in most places, because of increases in the capability of the German defence, the impossibility of obtaining surprise and a lack of time to plan operations or to rest troops. P√©tain wrote that German barrages were being fired daily, which made infantry attacks almost impossible and that varying French bombardments to obtain surprise made little difference, now that the German artillery had been reinforced and was ready at a moment's notice to begin barrage fire. German guns were registered on no man's land and had only to fire into the area to hit French infantry during an attack. The French counter-battery effort had to wait until German guns revealed themselves and then begin area fire near the German artillery, which was a waste of ammunition. P√©tain wanted more air reconnaissance but aircraft wireless was of extremely short range and during attacks, confusion on the ground made artillery observation from the air impossible. As an alternative, P√©tain suggested making highly detailed maps of the German rear areas and systematically bombarding German artillery emplacements continuously, rather than during attacks but the suggestions were impractical, because of the ammunition shortage. Foch and d'Urbal met late on 15 May and ordered that the offensive was to end temporarily, as the attacks after 9 May had been poorly prepared and of diminishing effectiveness. Preparations with the standard of detail and organisation of the attack on 9 May, were to be made before the offensive resumed. \\"Bases of departure\\" were to be captured at Souchez and Neuville, before an attack on Vimy Ridge, which Foch expected to take eight to ten days. D'Urbal cancelled an attack due on 16 May and issued instructions to each corps to capture limited objectives. XXXIII Corps was given five objectives before an attack on Souchez and XXI Corps three objectives before supporting the attack on Souchez. The first limited objective attack was planned for 17 May but rainstorms forced a delay until 20 May and the night of Huge artillery bombardments preceded infantry attacks, intended to occupy several hundred square metres of ground at a time. On the afternoon of 21 May, the French attacked the Spur of the White Way from the north, south and west. A party attacking from the Arabs' Spur captured their objectives in minutes and another party attacking from the north seized the main German communication trench, surrounding and taken the garrison prisoner. The attack from Ablain captured houses west of the church and the communications trench linking the White Way with Souchez was cut; prisoners and a field gun were taken. At on 22 May, a German counter-attack from a foothold in Ablain was repulsed. On 25 May IX, XXI and XXXIII corps attacked limited objectives simultaneously, after a day-long artillery bombardment but made little progress. The remnants of the garrison in Ablain were attacked again on 28 May in their remaining trenches around the cemetery. French artillery placed a barrage to the east of the cemetery, cutting off the garrison before the infantry attacked and took During the night the Germans in a group of houses to the south of the church were mopped up and outside the village a strong point was taken. Early on 29 May the remaining German positions at the church and rectory were captured. French casualties in the final attack were caused by artillery fire. The French attacked into the valley and on 31 May captured Mill Malon, advanced up a communication trench to the sugar refinery and rushed the German garrison, which was overwhelmed as dark fell. At midnight a German counter-attack gradually pushed the French back into the communication trench. A French artillery barrage was arranged and troops on the outskirts of Ablain advanced to the refinery along the stream, as the troops at the communication trench reorganised and attacked again. The Germans were forced back and by the evening of 1 June the position was connected with Ablain by communication trenches (fighting in the area continued sporadically from June‚ÄìSeptember). From 25 to 28 May French attacks towards Andres failed. D'Urbal continued the limited-objective attacks but transferred the main artillery effort south to Neuville. A three-day preparatory bombardment began on 2 June and on 6 June French infantry captured the main road through the village, as the German garrison replied with massed small-arms fire from cellars and demolished houses. German artillery-fire also caused many French casualties but by 11 June, the French had advanced on a front. British First Army The British adopted siege warfare tactics of limited attacks prepared by a greater weight of artillery fire, to capture more ground and hold it with fewer casualties. British attacks resumed near Festubert from Port Arthur north to Rue du Bois, with a night attack by three divisions at on 15 May, after a three-day bombardment, with carefully observed on a front. The German breastwork was destroyed but many of the machine-gun posts underneath survived, as did infantry dugouts under the second line of breastworks. The attack was limited to an objective about forward along La Quinque Rue road. On the right flank the advance succeeded, a silent advance surprising the surviving Germans in the remains of the breastwork and then capturing the (support trench) before digging in. On the left German return fire stopped the advance in no man's land. An attack at on the right by the 7th Division was successful in parts but with many casualties. Much of the German front line was destroyed and captured but scattered German parties in shell-holes blocked both flanks and prevented a further British advance. On 16 May Haig resumed the offensive with the Battle of Festubert, which was fought on the right flank of the Aubers Ridge battlefield, where British troops were ordered to press on to local objectives only after consolidating. By the morning of 17 May, the German 14th Division was forced to retire to a new breastwork dug behind the original front position, connecting the (strongpoint line) behind the front line, with the result that British bombardments and attacks met only small parties of rearguards. The Quadrilateral was captured at about on 17 May after an extensive bombardment led to a large number of German troops surrendering. Reinforcements doubled the German firepower in the new position, from which in the afternoon British attempts to continue the advance were repulsed. Low cloud and rain obscured the battlefield and it took three days for the British to identify the new line. A series of attacks by four British divisions from achieved minor advances of the British line but found that the captured positions had been registered by German artillery, which maintained a heavy bombardment, which forced the British back at some places and inflicted many casualties. The fighting cost the British and the Germans . Fighting continued until 25 May for local objectives against German reinforcements, which were not available to oppose the French further south. =Third phase, 13‚Äì18 June= Tenth Army The eight days, that Foch thought necessary to capture ground on the flanks of XXXIII Corps, took five weeks to achieve. Small advances were made but the Germans were able to improve their defences relatively easily, in dips and behind slopes. Artillery reinforcements were registered as they arrived on obvious avenues of attack, which required only notification by flare signals from the front line to commence firing. The Tenth Army also received substantial reinforcements of artillery but these made only a small net increase, due to losses from German artillery fire, mechanical failures and premature detonations. Infantry reinforcements were only marginally greater than losses. Artillery ammunition for the and guns was much greater for the second general attack, with available from 16 to 18 June, compared to from 3 to 9 May. The preliminary bombardment was to begin on 10 June and concentrate on certain areas to conceal the imminence of an infantry attack. On the day of the attack, the artillery was to destroy defences repaired by the Germans overnight and conduct counter-battery fire until the last moment, as a deception, then fall on the German front defences as the French infantry advanced, to mislead the Germans and get the infantry across no man's land before a German barrage began. The Franco-British attack on 9 May had been on a front of and in June three supporting attacks were planned by the French Second, Sixth and Seventh armies, along with an attack by the British near Zillebeke in Flanders. The preliminary bombardment was due to begin on 13 June and XXI Corps was to attack from the Lorette Spur towards Bois de Givenchy, XX Corps was to complete the capture of Neuville and the and XXIII Corps was shifted slightly north to attack Souchez, Ch√¢teau Carleul, and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. IX Corps was moved from the northern boundary of the Tenth Army and placed between XXXIII Corps and XX Corps to take Vimy Ridge. During minor attacks in early June, the IX Corps divisions had gained little success and in one attack the infantry went to ground and refused to continue, which if repeated would leave the XXXIII Corps vulnerable to another advance into a salient. The artillery preparation was carefully observed from the front line and IX Corps troops were issued flares to signal to the artillery, who reported a highly accurate bombardment, particularly on the crossroads and a derelict mill, which were the principal German defensive works opposite. On 15 June the commander of the 17th Division on the right of the IX Corps, wrote to General Cur√©, the corps commander, that preparations were incomplete and had not conformed to Note 5779, leaving the jumping-off trenches from the German front line, rather than the or fewer laid down and that the infantry were already exhausted. In the rest of the Tenth Army the situation was the same, with infantry being set to hours of digging under German counter- bombardments. It was also discovering that the accuracy of French artillery- fire, was not sufficient make it effective. An attack on 13 June, by a regiment of the 70th Division on the sugar refinery, captured a small length of the German front trench, where they were bombarded by French artillery. An attack on 14 June took another short length of trench but the regiment had to be relieved by part of the 13th Division during the night of Reports from the IX and XX corps on the southern flank, described accurate French artillery fire and XXI Corps on the Lorette Spur had a commanding view of German defences. Maistre the corps commander, had made artillery observation a specialist role for trained men, who kept close to the infantry to ensure efficient liaison. It was soon discovered that the Germans had put barbed wire in front of the front line, rather than just in front and special bombardments were fired to cut the wire, after which patrols went forward to check the results, despite German counter-bombardments. On the 43rd Division front, it was discovered that field artillery was only shifting the barbed wire around and not damaging but modern were used in time to create several gaps in the wire. Visibility early on 16 June was poor and the French heavy artillery began with a slow bombardment until when a creeping barrage began to move from the French front line in bounds and a second barrage began at maximum range and crept backwards in bounds, until both barrages coincided on Vimy Ridge and became a standing barrage until the French infantry arrived. The IX Corps divisions found that the German defences were intact, when the attack began and the 17th Division was swept by artillery and machine-gun fire, forcing it back to its jumping-off trenches; the 18th Division managed to capture the German first position and a second attack was ordered for the afternoon. IX, XX and XXXIII corps used which contained poison gas and incendiary material on Neuville, Souchez and Angres, German artillery positions at and rear areas. The shells were filled with carbon disulphide and phosphorus, which gave a combined asphyxiating and incendiary effect. The gas shells suppressed the German artillery opposite from and set many fires in Angres but not at Souchez, which had been bombarded so much that there was little combustible material left. The 17th Division managed to advance another and the 18th Division was stopped in no man's land. On the right flank the 39th Division of XX Corps was repulsed in the first attack, despite creeping forward before zero hour, to be clear of a German counter-bombardment and to catch the German infantry under cover. The division prepared a new bombardment for on the German front line, to at least advance across no man's land. The new attack also failed, as did the attacks of the 17th and 11th divisions on either flank. In the XXXIII Corps area, the DM was fresh and easily overran the German front defences with minimal casualties. When the infantry pressed on, they found that the Germans had dug overlapping flanking positions and deep dugouts, which had protected German infantry from the French artillery. The infantry reached where fire from Souchez stopped the advance. Supporting troops had lagged behind in communication trenches full of wounded and prisoners as German artillery-fire increased and only arrived at German counter-attacks were made using many hand grenades, which caused many casualties. To the north, the 77th and 70th divisions attacked Souchez, where the chemical shells had little effect; the 77th divisional artillery had twice the number of shells than on 9 May but was nullified by the new German defences on reverse slopes, which were immune to fire from guns and could only be engaged by Howitzers, which were brought forward on only twelve hours before the attack. The 159th Regiment advanced over a hillock, met uncut wire and massed fire from small arms and artillery, out of view of the French front line. The 97th Regiment captured Souchez cemetery with few casualties but the repulse of the 159th Regiment uncovered the flanks of the 97th Regiment and the adjacent DM, which made an attack on Souchez village impossible. An attack by the 159th Regiment at was also stopped immediately by German return fire. In the XXI Corps area, the 70th Division was bombarded by German artillery as the attack began, in response to flares sent up from the German front line. The 42nd BCP took part of Ch√¢teau Carleul against determined German resistance but then stopped to maintain contact with the 77th Division to the right. The 360th and 237th regiments were met by a wall of fire and were not able to advance, except on the far left flank, where the 13th Division had managed to push forward for . The 48th Division on the northern flank of XXI Corps, advanced for about and took its initial objectives in in a costly attack. At zero hour, the 43rd Division on the left of XXI Corps, blew a mine under the German defences opposite and rushed the crater with few losses, before the Germans could counter-attack. D'Urbal ordered the attack to continue on 17 June, on the fronts of the 77th Division and IX Corps on either flank of XXXIII Corps, where the most advanced positions of the DM had become untenable. The attack was ordered for and then postponed, leading to some units attacking too early, being pinned down in front of uncut wire and then being bombarded by French as well as German artillery. The 70th Division and the XXI Corps divisions on the northern flank, took several German positions in costly attacks but the IX Corps attack on the southern flank was deluged with artillery and machine-gun fire and made no progress. On 18 June d'Urbal concentrated the remaining offensive capacity of the Tenth Army against Vimy Ridge. IX Corps was ordered to ignore the German defences in Neuville but General Balfourier the XX Corps commander, refused to attack with the northern flank unsupported. The attack on 18 June was another failure, in which French infantry were again confronted by German positions on reverse slopes, invisible to ground observation and undamaged, with uncut wire and alert defenders, who inflicted many casualties on the attackers. Foch suspended the offensive but d'Urbal reverted to piecemeal attacks for another week until Joffre intervened and ended the offensive. Second Action of Givenchy In the Second Action of Givenchy IV Corps of the British First Army, attacked north-west of La Bass√©e with the 7th, 51st and Canadian divisions after a bombardment, in which an attempt to alleviate an acute ammunition shortage was made by relying on artillery observation and tactical reconnaissance by reinforced RFC squadrons. No covering fire was available for the attack and the German defenders were seen to have manned the front line before the advance began. The Germans opened massed small-arms fire but were not able to prevent the British from entering the German front trench, where a bombing fight began. German infantry were well-supplied with hand grenades but the British were isolated by cross-fire along no man's land and were pushed back as they ran out of ammunition, the last troops retiring at A new attack on 15 June, using all of the artillery ammunition left was delayed by thick mist and the difficulty in reorganising the infantry but went ahead at and took the German front line. The advance was stopped until the line was consolidated but the British and Canadian troops who had not been pinned down in their own trenches were forced back by a German counter-attack at after which further attacks were cancelled. First Attack on Bellewaarde The British Second Army conducted the First Attack on Bellewaarde on 16 June with the 3rd Division, which took the German first line easily at The second and third waves rushed forward and ran into the British bombardment, which was not seen by the gunners due to the amount of mist and smoke created by the bombardment. The British still managed to reach the German second line and three German counter-attacks had only managed to push the 3rd Division back to the first line, when the British ran short of ammunition. Support from a brigade of the 14th Division to exploit the success, was delayed by German artillery-fire and fewer than two battalions of the 3rd Division managed to advance at up a flat open slope and were repulsed with many casualties. At the German front trench from Menin road to Railway Wood was consolidated, which was short of Bellewaarde ridge and the German observation posts along it. Joffre criticised British \\"inaction\\", which enabled the Germans to concentrate resources against the Tenth Army. =German 6th Army= 9‚Äì14 May The British First Army attacked in the Battle of Aubers Ridge, in support of the French offensive further south. North of La Bass√©e Canal, British artillery fire increased against the II Bavarian and XIX Saxon corps and at an attack began against the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division and broke into the first line north of Fromelles. Fighting continued into the evening, when the trenches were recaptured. More British attacks occurred at Richbourg l'Avou√© and at times penetrated to the German first line before being repulsed. Little ground was captured, none was held against German counter-attacks and German troops were soon sent south to reinforce the Arras front. French artillery bombarded the German lines overnight and then abated until when a bombardment, slowly increasing in intensity began on the fronts of VII, XIV and I Bavarian Reserve corps, which from mid-morning reached the extent of . Lulls in the fire were ruses to prompt German infantry to emerge from shelter, only to be caught in more ; the German artillery reply was sparse. The French infantry assembled unseen and the advance began after several mines were sprung, obtaining a measure of surprise. The main French attack was received at on the left of XIV Corps and against I Bavarian Reserve Corps, from Lens to Arras, as a second attack began against the centre of XIV Corps along the B√©thune‚ÄìLens road, which was repulsed by a counter-attack. The 28th Division on the Lorette Spur, was forced out of the front trenches, with many losses and in the evening a battalion of was sent forward. Further south, the villages of Ablain-St. Nazaire (Ablain) and Carency were held against determined French attacks. By noon of the German front defences had fallen and the French had penetrated up to a depth of . In the I Bavarian Reserve Corps area (General Karl von Fasbender), the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division (General Kress von Kressenstein) south of Carency, was pushed back to a line from Cabaret Rouge to Neuville-St. Vaast (Neuville) and French troops advanced as far as artillery positions around Givenchy-en-Gohelle (Givenchy), where reinforcements arrived at noon and managed to forestall a new French attack. To the south, the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division (Lieutenant-General G√∂ringer) managed to repulse the French in hand-to-hand fighting and then enfilade the French further north, who had broken through at La Targette. Crown Prince Rupprecht applied to Falkenhayn, for the two divisions in OHL reserve and the 115th Division (Major-General von Kleist) was moved behind the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division. The 58th Division (Lieutenant-General von Gersdorf) went into the 6th Army reserve and closed up to Lens, as artillery also released from the OHL reserve came forward. On the southern flank of the breakthrough, French attacks were also pushing slowly through the network of trenches known as the . North of Ecurie, Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 12 took over more ground to the north and prevented the French from widening the breakthrough and in Neuville St. Vaast a counter- attack by a battalion of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 10 retook the east end of the village and many of the field guns which had been lost earlier. A defence line was improvised between Neuville and La Folie to the north and was used to engage the French troops further north with flanking fire. Bavarian Infantry Regiment 7 was rushed up from reserve to counter-attack the French on Vimy Ridge. The French were pushed back from the heights of Hill 145 and Hill 119 (the Pimple) by At the east end of the Lorette Spur the 28th Division was forced out of the first position. By afternoon, the left flank of XIV Corps had been uncovered near Carency. Rupprecht intended to use the remnants of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division and the 115th Division to counter-attack and regain the lost positions. Instead, the 115th Division was sent to defend the right flank of the I Bavarian Reserve Corps and the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division was found to be too depleted to attack. Troops managed to counter- attack at Souchez and retook some ground, before being stopped by massed French artillery-fire around By evening, Rupprecht knew that twelve French divisions had attacked four German divisions but believed that the French could be driven back. OHL sent the 117th Division to Douai and Rupprecht subordinated two regiments of the 58th Division to the I Bavarian Reserve Corps, for the counter-attack at Souchez. Artillery was sent to the east of Vimy Ridge, to support the attack. During the night, a French attack captured the front trenches astride the B√©thune‚ÄìLens road and Lieutenant-General von Haenisch sent the last corps reserve to the 29th Division (Lieutenant-General Isbert); a counter-attack in the morning recovered the trenches. To the south- west of Carency, the trench to Souchez was lost, which left Carency almost surrounded. Rupprecht and Haenisch planned to counter-attack from Souchez to Neuville, with the I Bavarian Reserve Corps and the 58th and 115th divisions, rather than retire. At French attacks began on the Lorette Spur and at Carency but were not able to push back the defenders. At the 58th Division began the German counter-attack, with parts of the 115th Division to the south and at first made good progress, before being stopped by French defensive fire. The 28th Division headquarters began to fear that the line between Ablain and Carency would fall. On 10 May, the I Bavarian Reserve Division managed to retain its positions despite French attacks, particularly at Neuville on the right flank but several counter-attacks supported by parts of IV Corps and the 115th Division, recovered only small parts of the village. Next day, Fasbender doubted that the line from Ablain to Carency could be held and asked for more reinforcements. Falkenhayn released the 117th Division (General Kuntze) and sent the VIII Corps headquarters with the 16th Division to Douai as a replacement OHL reserve. To avoid a retirement, which would lead to the loss of the Lorette Spur, Rupprecht met the corps commanders and issued a standfast order, encouraged by the quietude of the French during the morning of 11 May. French attacks in the afternoon were poorly co-ordinated and repulsed with many casualties. A captured order showed that the French were making a maximum effort to break through; a regiment of the 117th Division was made available to the 6th Army as a precaution and part of the 58th Division was moved closer to the 28th Division on the Lorette Spur. On 11 May, Rupprecht was ordered by Falkenhayn not to retire under any circumstances, with the discretion to achieve this by attack or defence and replied that a counter-attack was not feasible. Next day, two regiments of the 117th Division were added to I Bavarian Reserve Corps to protect Neuville and reinforcements arriving to re- establish the OHL reserve behind the 6th Army were taken over; part of the 15th Division was sent to Douai as a new OHL reserve and Falkenhayn suggested that a special headquarters be set up to co-ordinate counter-attacks. On 13 June, Rupprecht repeated his orders to XIV Corps to hold Carency and Haenisch sent pioneers to dig a reserve trench behind the left flank of the 28th Division. French pressure on the Lorette Spur had eased and a regiment of the 58th Division retook trenches on the northern slope. No counter-attack was possible at Carency and the I Bavarian Reserve Corps concentrated on holding the line from Souchez to Neuville and St. Laurent, which was attacked again during the afternoon. Gaps either side of Hill 123 were closed by counter- attacks but a gap between a depression known as , north of the Lorette Spur and Souchez could not be closed and Carency was almost surrounded. The defences to the west and south had been lost on 9 May and constant French attacks slowly overwhelmed the defenders. At on 12 May, a French bombardment of fell on the remaining German positions to the north of the village. The survivors were cut off and the village captured over the next two days. French attacks in the north began to diminish on 13 May, as rain storms turned the battlefield into a swamp but at on 15 May a hurricane bombardment fell on Souchez until but no infantry attack followed the bombardment. Late on 12 May Rupprecht created to control the units in the areas of the XIV and I Bavarian Reserve corps, to hold the existing positions and establish a defence line from Carency and Neuville. A counter-attack at the cemetery south of Souchez but failed without support from the Carency area, where a French attack at dusk had captured the village. The defeat threatened the rest of the German line, Haenish ordered an immediate bombardment of the village and the 28th Division to dig a new line, from the Lorette Spur to the Ablain church and Souchez. A battalion of the 117th Division was sent to the 28th Division and a 16th Division regiment was moved to Lens as a replacement. By 13 June, the right flank of the 28th Division still held the northern slope of the Lorette Spur, the line either side of the Lorette Chapel had been lost from the (Muddy Hollow) to the Ablain track. Most of Ablain had been captured but French attempts to advance further, had been repulsed in mutually costly fighting and a lull occurred, except for a small French attack at Neuville during the day. Rupprecht rated the 29th Division as worn out, the condition of the 28th Division as not much better and the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division as exhausted. The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division, 58th and 115th divisions were severely damaged and had been incurred from Rupprecht requested more reinforcements to replace all of the worn-out divisions and Falkenhayn began to strip more units from the Western Front. Falkenhayn also appointed General Ewald von Lochow, the III Corps commander to control the units being sent to the 6th Army. The 117th Division began to relieve the 28th Division on the night of and the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division remnants were relieved during the day. General Julius Riemann the VIII Corps commander, took over the 16th, 58th, 115th and part of the 15th divisions from Souchez to Neuville. The reinforcement of the 6th Army had drained the OHL reserve and further claims by Rupprecht were refused, which led him to complain to the Kaiser.  North of the Lorette Spur and in the area of the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division, most of the old front line was intact. North of the Carency stream, XIV Corps held parts of the front line in , along (Barricade Way) and the east end of Ablain. South of the stream, the line was held by a mixture of the 58th and 115th divisions, the remnants of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division and a regiment of the 52nd Reserve Infantry Brigade. In reserve, the 16th Division (Lieutenant-General Fuchs) was ready to move into line from Souchez to Hill 123 on a front, the 15th Division and the new 1st Trench Mortar Battalion had arrived in the 6th Army area. Lochow took over from 14 May to 12 June and continued to reorganise mingled units and withdraw tired troops into reserve. Artillery command in each area was centralised for barrage fire, counter- battery bombardments and flanking fire into other areas. The 5th Bavarian Reserve and 58th divisions were relieved by the 16th Division and three corps sectors established, XIV Corps on the right with the 117th Division and 85th Reserve Brigade, VIII Corps with the 115th and 58th divisions from the Carency stream to the Arras‚ÄìLens road and the 1st Bavarian Reserve Corps, with the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division and 52nd Infantry Brigade, from the road to the Scarpe river. Lochow planned a counter-attack by XIV Corps to regain the commanding ground of the Lorette Spur, from 15 to 17 May and succeeded only in exhausting the 117th Division, which had to be withdrawn. Air reconnaissance observed huge numbers of French guns and troops arriving at Doullens station, which showed that the French offensive would continue. A counter-attack to capture Ecurie, to disrupt the French artillery effort was considered and rejected due to the shortage of troops. Only at Neuville could troops assemble unseen and have good artillery observation. The 15th Division (Major-General Vollbrecht) at Neuville, was reinforced with troops from the 115th Division and attacked at on 22 May; despite a 1st Trench Mortar Battalion bombardment and flame thrower support, the attack was a costly failure. To the south, the defence of the continued, with frequent attacks to recover the first position in the centre, to relieve the right flank, which had been enveloped on three sides but without which Neuville could not be held. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 2 managed to assemble troops for a counter-attack towards the and advanced for about before being repulsed. French attacks in the opposite direction up to six times each day also failed, except for some ground on the Th√©lus road on the evening of 11 May. German reinforcements which had just arrived, were rushed forward to block the French advance on Th√©lus. The British attacked on the night of south of Neuve Chapelle and by 20 May, had advanced and drawn in German reinforcements, which were able to defeat British attacks from over the Estaires‚ÄìLa Bass√©e road. The French offensive had severely eroded the 6th Army, which had used up all the fresh units sent from the OHL reserve in France. The 2nd Guard Reserve Division was diverted to VII Corps opposite the British and units worn out by the French supporting attacks beyond Artois were needed, before they had been rested. Only the tired 111th Division, 123rd Division and 8th Bavarian Reserve Division remained in the OHL reserve. Artillery reinforcements increased the firepower of the 6th Army, from howitzers and guns to howitzers and guns by 22 May, with plenty of ammunition. From the 6th Army had fired artillery and shells. On 19 May, Krafft von Delmensingen, the 6th Army Chief of Staff, was replaced by Colonel von Wenge and sent to Italy with the new . At the Lorette Spur, the 117th Division was sent forward to relieve the 28th Division on 18 May, from the (Muddy Hollow) to Ablain and the south end of Souchez. Most of the trenches had been demolished and those near the river were deep in water. Delivery of supplies was intermittent, because field kitchens had to be set up well back to avoid shellfire. The remaining defences had been improvised between attacks many were overlooked from a flank and some from French positions behind them. A big attack on 21 May, pushed the defenders back and a counter-attack failed to restore the position, which was re-established further back along a track at the northern fringe of Ablain. Trenches were dug forwards towards the Lorette Spur, which gave some flank protection. II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 157 was severely depleted in the fighting and was relieved by units from six regiments. Constant French attacks slowly forced the surviving defenders back but the consequences of losing ground north-west of Souchez were so dangerous, that a stream of German units were sent to hold the area between late May and 7 June. After several days of minor operations, French infantry attacked from the Lorette Spur to the Scarpe at From Ecurie southwards, the French were seen assembling and bombarded, which stopped the attack in no man's land. In the north, several footholds were gained and only recaptured during the night. Lochow requested more reinforcements, IV Corps south of Arras with the 8th and 7th divisions, was exchanged with two burnt- out divisions and the 111th Division took over the line from the 8th Division; the 115th Division was relieved at Neuville by the 58th Division. French attacks continued from 25 to 26 May, from Li√©vin to Souchez which captured German trenches, then lost them to German counter-attacks. On 27 May, Ablain cemetery and trenches to the south were lost, which made the village untenable and on 28 May, the Germans retired to a line either side of the sugar refinery west of Souchez. Local attacks continued and on 29 May, a French attack up the road from Aix-Noulette to Souchez was repulsed by Reserve Infantry Brigade 85. Lochow suspected that the attack was a ruse and next day the French attacked further south. On 30 May, French artillery-fire fell in the south and extended into the VIII Corps area, before an attack at from Souchez to Roclincourt, which was eventually repulsed. Late on 31 May, trenches between Angres, the Carency stream and the sugar refinery were lost and only the trenches to the north were recaptured on 1 June after many counter-attacks. During the evening, an attack from Neuville to Tsingtao Trench captured the trench, which threatened the German hold on the . Lochow put Fasbinder in command with the 58th Division and moved the 15th Division to Neuville. British diversionary attacks around Givenchy-lez-la-Bass√©e, continued during early June and were repulsed in costly fighting by VII and XIX corps. In , the battle for the continued and from 4 to 6 June, the French attacked Neuville. After an attack on 8 June, the defenders retired to a trench further east. French attacks on the Lorette Spur were co-ordinated with those at Neuville and exhausted the XIV Corps troops, which were replaced by the 7th and 8th divisions of IV Corps, which had been reserved for a counter-attack. To the south, the French had taken the cemetery at Neuville and built a strong point, from which attacks on the rest of Neuville were made, threatening the German hold on the , to the south. By 7 June the defence of Neuville had begun to collapse, despite exhortations from the German high command that the area was to be held at all costs. Officers of the 58th Division wanted permission to withdraw from the village but freedom to make a temporary limited withdrawal in a crisis was given but only to organise a counter-attack. The north-west of the village fell on 8 June, after the last defenders of Infantry Regiment 160 were bombarded by their own artillery. A battalion of the 15th Division was sent to counter-attack a French salient, near the in the , as soon as it arrived on the Artois front, supported by grenade teams and flame-thrower detachments. The attack failed but the and some ground at the was recovered. French attacks at the were as frequent as those further north and the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division counter-attacked in the early hours of 11 June, which recaptured a trench. French preparations for another general attack were observed by the German defenders and large amounts of artillery ammunition were brought forward. On 10 June the senior gunner in the 15th Division predicted a French attack from Vimy to La Folie, Th√©lus and Neuville St. Vaast, which if successful, would lead to the loss of the German artillery around Vimy and La Folie. No forces were available for a spoiling attack and at Roclincourt, Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 had watched the French sapping forward to within of their positions and endured the French preparatory bombardment. The French shelling grew in weight until when a mine was sprung. French infantry attacked, broke into the position and the defenders built flanking barricades to prevent the French from rolling up the flanks of the German position. Other German troops formed a blocking position in front of the French penetration and the German artillery bombarded the lost ground and no man's land, to prevent French reserves from moving forward. Counter-attacks by troops held back in reserve were able to push the French out of their footholds but at the cost of \\"grievous\\" losses. 16‚Äì18 June On 7 June, Falkenhayn met the 6th Army commanders and accepted their claim that only with fresh troops could the 6th Army positions be held. The 5th and 123rd divisions were sent to the 6th Army and XIX Saxon Corps was relieved by IV Corps on 14 June. The 117th Division was moved from the Lorette Spur beyond the B√©thune‚ÄìLens road for a rest but around Li√©vin and Angres, the 7th Division (Lieutenant-General Riedel) and 8th Division (Major-General von Hanstein) held decrepit trenches which could not be repaired at night because French searchlights illuminated the ground to catch German troops in the open. At south of the Aix- Noulette‚ÄìSouchez road was relatively protected from French artillery-fire but was covered in corpses, which revolted the troops who could not bury the dead. Many attempts were made to close a gap to a switch trench, which led towards the sugar refinery and Souchez. Two breastworks had been built near the Ch√¢teau and more fortifications had been built in Souchez. An absence of attacks in the 16th Division area had been used to repair the defences from Souchez to Hill 123 but the trenches in the 5th Division (Major-General von Gabain) area were derelict. In the I Bavarian Reserve Corps area, the 58th Division still held much of the and to the south the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division and the exhausted 52nd Reserve Infantry Brigade, which had held the line since the beginning of the offensive were still in the original front line, although the trenches were severely damaged. The German artillery had been reorganised into divisional groups and batteries south of the Scarpe, maintained flanking fire on the French guns north of the river. A new trench line ordered by Lochow had been dug from Loos to Lens, Vimy and Th√©lus and a new line was planned east of Lens to Oppy and Feuchy, far enough back to negate the tactical advantage of artillery support from Vimy Ridge, should it be captured. Signs of another French attack increased and on 14 June, French reconnaissance patrols were active from Angres to Neuville and French artillery-fire grew in intensity. Super-heavy shells sufficient to penetrate concrete shelters fell in Souchez, Givenchy, Th√©lus and Farbus, destroying command posts and staging areas. At dawn on 16 June, much of the German wire had been cut, many trenches had been demolished and the defending infantry had suffered many casualties. At noon, the French attacked from Li√©vin to the Scarpe, with little return fire from the German artillery, which had been suppressed by counter-battery fire and under observation from French aircraft, which flew overhead unchallenged. Late on 16 June, the French attacked in a smoke-screen and reached the forward German positions, where several footholds was gained and protected by box-barrages. German counter-attacks later in the evening eliminated one foothold and took but further to the left a French foothold was maintained by the weight of covering artillery-fire. By night, the French had consolidated in the 7th Division trenches at Li√©vin and Angres. The German survivors in the , between Angres and the chapel at Notre Dame de Lorette, were forced back. House-to-house fighting continued in Souchez and in the 16th Division area, where the front line for had been lost. Some French troops reached German artillery positions, beyond which were no trench defences. Against the 5th Division in the south, the French attacks collapsed but the 58th Division at the and areas just to the south were broken through. In counter-attacks during the night by , the 7th Division recaptured trenches at Li√©vin and Angres but failed to the south-west and at . The 8th Division regained the second Lorette switch line and the 16th Division cleared a few isolated penetrations but not the area south of Souchez; artillery-fire prevented the digging of a switch trench. A continuous barrage () was maintained on the breakthrough, which prevented the French advancing further, except at the churchyard at Souchez and by dawn the had been recaptured. About prisoners were taken. The 6th Army was reduced to a desperate position and OHL sent VI Corps units forward as they arrived. On 17 June the French attack resumed and broke into the 5th Division defences and was then pushed out from there and either side by counter-attacks. A French advance to the north along the Aix-Noulette‚ÄìSouchez road made untenable and it was abandoned overnight; (Moroccan Copse) on the Arras‚ÄìB√©thune road was lost. There were many German casualties and the 16th Division was relieved by the 11th Division of VI Corps; the 58th Division was kept in line for lack of a replacement. OHL provided the 15th Division, which had had only a few days' rest and the 123rd Division in an emergency. The 12th Division of VI Corps could not hasten its arrival before 19 June and the 187th Infantry Brigade was hurried north, the 53rd Reserve Division relieved the 3rd Bavarian Division which then replaced the 58th Division and another thirteen heavy batteries were sent to the 6th Army. held the north with the IV Corps headquarters, the 117th and 123rd Saxon divisions on the right, the 7th and 8th divisions on the left and the 3rd Ersatz Brigade in reserve. VIII Corps held the central area with the 11th and 5th divisions, the 12th Division (Lieutenant-General Chales de Beaulieu) to join on the northern flank and the 6th Division in 6th Army reserve when it arrived. The 3rd Bavarian, 1st Bavarian and 5th Bavarian Reserve divisions held the southern area and the 15th and 16th divisions were to be withdrawn. French attacks on 18 June, were smaller and optimism rose that the offensive was ending. OHL ordered that the defences were to be thinned quickly, to provide a new strategic reserve. The 6th Army headquarters and Lochow protested that the troop reductions were premature and on 24 June, Lochow predicted more attacks, emphasised the need for a flow of fresh divisions and that the number of casualties required consideration of a retirement to the new defence line behind Vimy Ridge. Until the end of June, the Germans tried to restore their front positions but failed to regain the Lorette Spur and the French artillery maintained a bombardment from Angres to Souchez. The 12th Division was brought forward to reinforce the area and French attacks on 25 July and 27 June were repulsed by counter-attacks. In the old 16th Division area south of Souchez, the 11th Division gradually recaptured the area lost on 16 June. Fighting at the continued until 24 June, when the 3rd Bavarian Division restored the old front line. The exhausted 52nd Reserve Infantry Brigade was relieved on 25 June and on 28 June was dissolved and replaced by the VI Corps headquarters (General von Pritzelwitz). The Arras front remained the most important area on the German Western Front and Falkenhayn planned to send divisions from the Eastern Front to protect against another Franco- British offensive. Rupprecht claimed that the 6th Army could hold its ground without reinforcement and the redeployments were cancelled. During July skirmishing took place around Souchez but the French offensive was not resumed. In August, the Western Army was reorganised, more units moved into reserve and a programme of trench digging was begun along all of the Western Front. =Air operations= On 11 March, Major Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen was appointed (Chief of Field Air Forces) and began to increase the size of (Imperial German Flying Corps), with the formation of five new air units in Germany to provide replacements and expedite the introduction of the new Fokker E.I aircraft. New links between air units and the army were created, by the appointment of a staff officer for aviation to each army and in April, armed C-class aircraft began to reach front-line units. Reconnaissance aircraft detected increased movement behind the French Tenth Army front and more C-class aircraft were sent to the 6th Army, from the armies in quiet areas of the Western Front. Early on 9 May, French aircraft bombed the 6th Army headquarters at La Madeleine en Lille and railway stations in the town, with little effect. By 19 May, German aircraft reinforcements could make reconnaissance flights behind the French front and reported massive concentrations of artillery and the assembly of troops at the Doullens railway station, which were interpreted as signs of another big French offensive. =French supporting attacks= The French made secondary attacks along the Western Front, to pin down German reserves as part of the general action, intended to complement the decisive action at Arras. The Second Army attacked a German salient west of Serre on a front at Toutvent Farm, south of Souchez, from against the 52nd Division and gained on a front, at a cost of killed; German casualties were On 10 and 19 July, the 28th Reserve Division repulsed attacks near Fricourt. The 6th Army attacked a salient south of Quennevi√®res near Noyon, from and advanced on a front, with the German 18th Division had German attacks in the Argonne from 20 June, captured French positions at La Hazar√©e and another attack on 13 July, captured high ground west of Boureuilles and near Le Four de Paris. The German attacks took from 20 June. In the south-east, the First Army attacked the Saint-Mihiel salient from 1 May to 20 June. The 9th Division was pushed back to the second line by five French attacks; after several more attacks, the neighbouring 10th Division relieved the pressure on the road, with an attack on the (Les √âparges) on 26 June. The Germans gained a commanding position, from which counter-attacks were repulsed on 3 and 6 July. The French operations gained a small amount of ground for About beyond St. Mihiel, The Army Detachment of Lorraine attacked from advancing on a front and then on an front, with On 7 July, the III Bavarian Corps counter-attacked west of Apremont, captured French front trenches and resisted French attacks until 12 July, inflicting many losses. In late June, French attacks captured Gondrexon and next day the German 30th Reserve Division captured a hill at Ban-de-Sapt, until French counter-attacks on 8 and 24 July. The Seventh Army attacked to the west of Colmar from and advanced on a front. Attacks on high ground west of Metzeral from 5 to 7 May were repulsed but on 14 June the heights and the village of Sondernach were captured. Metzeral fell several days later and on 22 June, the Germans retired from the west bank of the Fecht to a line from M√ºhlbach east to the Hilsenfirst. The French suffered and the 19th Reserve Division with attached units suffered An attack on the and from 20 to 22 July failed but the was captured on 27 July; local fighting went on at the into August. The supporting attacks had minimal artillery support, took less ground than the Tenth Army and cost another about of the casualties incurred in Artois. Aftermath = Analysis = On 9 May, five French corps had attacked two German divisions on a front and advanced on the front of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division between the Lorette Spur and La Targette. The 77th Division and the DM of XXXIII Corps penetrated between Carency and Neuville, overran Regiment 39 and captured Hill 145, the highest point on Vimy Ridge The DM was then repulsed by local counter-attacks from Bavarian Infantry Regiment 7, which had been rushed forward from reserve. From 9 to 12 May the Tenth Army made the largest advance since trench warfare began, using the new tactics which caused the German defenders great difficulty, even on the flanks where the attacks were repulsed. The extent and tempo of the French plans proved too ambitious, given the material constraints affecting the Tenth Army and French munitions production. XXXIII Corps was forced off Vimy Ridge by German artillery-fire and flanking fire from Souchez and Neuville. A considerable tactical advantage had been gained by the French, who had regained of ground before the offensive was terminated. Foch wrote a report in early August in which he explained that the failure to hold Hill 145 was due to XXXIII Corps and the Tenth Army reserves being too distant and not deployed according to a proper reinforcement plan. At the beginning of the attack the XXXIII Corps reserve was a brigade of the DM, with a regiment at Mont St √âloi, behind the front and a regiment at Acq back, to keep them out of German artillery range. Three battalions were sent forward at half a battalion at and the rest of the battalion at to assist in consolidation and to be ready to defeat German counter-attacks, not to press on. The nearest Tenth Army reserve was the 18th Division, away. Foch wrote that no-one had expected the DM to advance in an hour. The slow and piecemeal arrival of reserves was made worse by the failure of the supporting attack to the north by the British First Army, which was defeated on 9 May at the Battle of Aubers Ridge. Subsequently, the British offensive was postponed until the Battle of Festubert on 16 May which resulted in the capture of the village and an advance of . From 21 April to 25 May, the British Second Army was engaged against the German 4th Army, in the Second Battle of Ypres which diverted British resources from the First Army. After 11 May, the Tenth Army began methodical local attacks, in which tactically important ground was attacked piecemeal, until another general attack could be made on Vimy Ridge. First- class French divisions had lost many experienced soldiers, which reduced them to mediocrity; the methods of Note 5779 had not been adopted consistently and became a greater problem when replacement troops with no experience, tried to continue the offensive. The attempt in June to capture Vimy Ridge with another set-piece attack was a costly failure, despite the intervening period of local attacks on the flanks of XXXIII Corps and the capture of the Lorette Spur. French tactics were unchanged and the constant local attacks left no time for training. Revisions to the stipulations of Note 5779 in mid-June were of minor significance and an amendment of 18 June only referred to the importance of cavalry in mobile warfare. German defensive changes were easy to implement quickly and by June had made the French methods of May obsolete. For as long as the Germans were able to retain Souchez and Neuville, French attacks between them could not capture Vimy Ridge and the defences of the villages were too formidable to be overcome quickly. The original plan for a series of attacks might have been able to remove Souchez and Neuville as obstacles but the material constraints on the French in the spring of 1915, meant that the plan devised by Foch could not be implemented. In September Foch wrote of the speed with which the Germans had moved reinforcements into the area from 9 to 18 May, dug new defensive lines and brought more heavy artillery into action, which from 18 May maintained barrages along all of the Tenth Army front. By 20 May the French artillery was dominated by the German artillery reinforcements, which severely inhibited the consolidation of captured ground and preparations for more attacks. Despite the change from attempts at continuous battle to methodical attacks, with pauses to reorganise and consolidate, the French took less ground, fewer prisoners and suffered more casualties. Foch concluded that a breakthrough was unlikely until the German armies in France had been depleted to a far greater extent; he advocated small step-by-step attacks, using methodical and economical methods. Fayolle wrote that the advocates of continuous battle were subject to a \\"grand illusion\\" and criticised Foch and d'Urbal for making unrealistic demands. Andr√© Laffargue, an artillery officer, was prompted to write , an example of the trend to artillery-based tactics and infiltration by infantry. From 10 to 16 June the French fired with less effect than the fired from 3 to 9 May. The Germans had managed to fire a heavy artillery barrage of which stopped the French infantry attack and prevented troops moving up in support. Attempts to repeat the surprise of 9 May by ruses failed and a German counter-barrage had begun in no man's land within two minutes of the French infantry advance. The experience of the attacks on 16 June demonstrated that the effect of counter-battery fire, neutralising fire and changes in the pattern and timing of artillery-fire made no difference if the German wire was uncut when the infantry advance began. German field defences were dug in increasing quantity and complexity during the offensive and German artillery became much more active, as more guns and much more ammunition arrived at the battlefront. The new German defences around the area were on ground overlooked from the Lorette Spur, were more costly to defend and made Vimy Ridge more vulnerable to attack. The apparent lost opportunity on 9 May, when Vimy Ridge was captured in the first rush, led the French army commanders to conclude that more of the same could achieve a breakthrough if better organised, which formed the basis of the planning for the autumn offensives in Artois and Champagne. P√©tain wrote that the attack on 9 May showed that a breakthrough was possible and that it could be achieved by careful preparation of communication trenches, jumping-off trenches and assembly positions, if the German defences were carefully reconnoitred and sufficiently bombarded by artillery. Since the defenders could close a gap quickly it would be necessary to maintain momentum, with reserve troops following up the attacking force closely. Attacks in open country were preferable to being bogged down in fighting for obstacles like villages and woods and the attack should be on a broad front, to allow centres of resistance to be outflanked and to disperse German fire power over a wider area. German analysis of the battle was collected in a memorandum of June 1915 and led to renewed emphasis on infantry shelters, deep enough to be invulnerable to heavy artillery and to increase the number of defensive positions behind the front, which would slow an advance and delay subsequent attacks, by forcing the attacker to move artillery into range. On 7 June a copy of Note 5779 was captured on the Artois front and the local corps commander ordered that intensive digging be undertaken and stipulated that reserve positions were to be as solidly built as front line defences. Much of the new digging on the rest of the Western Front was done on reverse slopes, invisible to ground observers and capable of being engaged only by howitzer- fire. The French methods of attack had been made obsolete by the time of the resumption of the offensive in September 1915, when many French troops were killed on such slopes, in front of uncut wire, before an undamaged second position. =Casualties= French sources put casualties from 3 May to 18 June at whom were killed; another were incurred in secondary operations. The German official historians of the recorded from 9 May ‚Äìto18 June, casualties and casualties. Sheldon recorded the same figures for French casualties, quoting the French Official History and for the German divisions most involved in the battle (1st and 5th Bavarian Reserve divisions, 3rd Bavarian, 5th, 11th, 15th, 16th and 115th divisions) noting that some figures are estimates believed to be too low but that the total was far fewer than French losses. In 2013 Krause recorded ranges of and casualties. =Subsequent operations= The battle had great influence on the French army during the preparations for the autumn offensive of 1915 in Champagne and Artois, which were also based on an assumption that strategic victories were possible after one or two days of offensive action. Joffre ordered another to double the number per brigade by 1 January 1916. Production of the 240 mm Trench Mortar () and trench mortar was increased and manufacture began of (ALGP, long range heavy guns); production of ammunition was reduced to increase quality and large orders were placed for aircraft and for gas shells. The growth of French war production by September 1915, enabled the French to attack in two places simultaneously. At the end of June, Joffre discussed strategy with the army group commanders and P√©tain, who had been promoted to the command of the Second Army. Foch again advocated a series of limited attacks, particularly in Artois where strategically important railways were relatively close behind the German lines. Castelnau believed that it was still possible to advance through the German defences in one attack and that Champagne was a likely region for such an attempt, if the mistakes made on 9 May could be avoided. P√©tain agreed with Foch but doubted that another offensive could quickly be prepared in Artois and was sceptical that any part of the Western Front was free of villages like Souchez and Neuville, which could be fortified and against which, only attacks even more limited than those advocated by Foch were practical. On 8 July, Joffre decided to make the principal attack in Champagne, with a supporting attack in Artois a few days earlier to attract German reserves. Joffre had accepted claims by Castelnau, that up to of ground could be gained in twenty-four hours and rejected a methodical battle, which Ammunition necessary for a methodical battle did not exist and the opportunity to attack the Germans, when so many divisions had been moved to the eastern front, could not be wasted. The offensive had been fought with unprecedented refinements of tactics and supply. Amendments to Note 5779 were suggested, to cover items like the use of grenades in two days by the 53rd Division and the importance of attention to detail; P√©tain of XXXIII Corps had ensured accurate preparatory bombardments and the tactical reflections written by P√©tain were added to the thinking in Note 5779. The ideal characteristics of a network of jumping-off trenches and the time and labour necessary to build it were laid down, so that troops could advance simultaneously and reserve troops could be protected as they moved forward. P√©tain wrote the plan for the , for the offensive of 25 September and his views were circulated through the French and British armies. The autumn offensive was fought as a breakthrough attempt, with changes to avoid the mistakes made in Artois in May and had significant tactical success but did not achieve a breakthrough, which led to the adoption of limited attacks in 1916. Krause wrote that the formulation Note 5779 showed that the French command system, was staffed by men who tried to improve the performance of the army and contradicts claims by Gudmundsson, that the Allied armies were too centralised to adapt. Lessons had been collected, analysed and distributed in a manner which combined top-down and bottom-up processes. A flaw in Note 5779, was persistence with a concept of rapid breakthrough, even after many soldiers considered that the war had become a siege and that none of the French offensives of 1915, had been intended to return to mobile warfare. Changes made to the plan for the Second Battle of Artois, had been intended to secure the capture Vimy Ridge as a jumping-off point, rather than to achieve a breakthrough and return to mobile warfare. In the autumn offensive which began on 25 September, with the Third Battle of Artois, Battle of Loos and the Second Battle of Champagne, the strategy was intended to make the Noyon salient untenable and regain a large portion of the occupied territories. Tactics used in the battles of May and June were revised and the creeping barrage became a standard method in all the Western Front armies. Improvements in French artillery tactics, were foreshadowed by the pauses in the creep of the 77th Division barrage on 9 May, which enabled the infantry to keep up and capture , the fanning-out barrages and hybrid barrages fired on 16 June, the use of chemical shells and artillery observation from aircraft equipped with wireless.

The title character, Diederich Hessling, a dedicated 'Untertan' in the sense of a person subservient to a monarch or prince, is an immoral man who is meant to serve as an allegory of both the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II and German society of his time. The novel was completed during the July Crisis in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of World War I. Extracts had been published in the satirical magazine Simplicissimus from 1912 onwards, causing great controversy. A book edition was not published until 1918 by Kurt Wolff in Leipzig.Peter E. Gordon, John P. McCormick Weimar Thought: A Contested Legacy - Page 224 1400846781 \\\\- 2013 When Der Untertan was finally published, it created a sensation. The violent responses to the novel give further evidence for Germany's political fragmentation at the time. But among the literati who most praised the novel was Kurt Tucholsky (1890‚Äì1935), who, in his review for the prestigious journal Die Weltb√ºhne, declared that this was the way Germany should fight to get rid of the German spirit of the Untertan. . Plot The socio-critical novel portrays the life of Diederich Hessling, a slavish and fanatical admirer of Kaiser Wilhelm II, as an archetype of Wilhelmine Germany. The name \\"Hessling\\" alludes to the German word for ugly, \\"\\". Hessling is unthinkingly obedient to authority and maintains a rigid dedication to the nationalist goals of the newly created German state. As a self-conscious and snivelling child, he acts as an informer. He later gains self-confidence by joining a duelling student fraternity, practising as a drunkard and Stammtisch agitator, and by narrowly obtaining a doctorate of chemistry. He becomes a paper manufacturer, family patriarch, and eventually the most influential man in his small town. Throughout the novel, Hessling's inflexible ideals are often contradicted by his actions: he preaches bravery but is a coward; he is the strongest proponent of the military but seeks to be excused from his obligatory military service; his greatest political opponents are the proletarian Social Democrats, yet he uses his influence to help send his hometown's SPD candidate to the Reichstag parliament, in order to defeat his liberal competitors in business; he starts vicious rumors against the latter and then dissociates himself from them; he preaches and enforces Christian virtues upon others but lies, cheats, and regularly commits infidelity. The plot ends with the solemn inauguration of an Emperor William monument, with Hessling delivering the speech, which is abruptly terminated by an apocalyptic thunderstorm. He faces the death of Buck, an old veteran of the democratic 1848 Revolution. Themes Diederich's ideals: blood and iron, and the might of opulent power, are exposed as hollowness and weakness. He is a critical allegory depicting German society's increasing susceptibility to chauvinism, jingoism, ultra-nationalism, anti-Semitism, and proto-fascism. His character is often juxtaposed, in both words and appearance to Kaiser Wilhelm II. In one instance, Hessling's behavior and outward appearance move an observer to stammer, 'It almost seems to me...You look so very much like His ...' , meaning the Kaiser. Mann uses the moral bankruptcy and shallow ridiculousness of Hessling's life to critique Wilhelmine German society generally. Like other novels of the period, such as Theodor Fontane's Effi Briest, or even his brother Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, the principal target is the hypocrisy of bourgeois society and the risk of social collapse in a nation of loyal 'Untertan' citizens. Thomas Mann, however, rejected the work as \\"heinous aestheticism\\", while Kurt Tucholsky proclaimed it as the \\"herbarium of the German man\\". The novel is frequently read in German schools up to today. Adaptation A lithograph named Der Untertan was created by Karl Hubbuch in 1923. In East Germany, the book was made into the 1951 DEFA film Der Untertan (released in English as The Kaiser's Lackey), directed by Wolfgang Staudte and starring Werner Peters as Diederich Hessling. It received the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic and initially was banned in West Germany until a shortened version was released in 1957. A radio drama was produced by the public Westdeutscher Rundfunk broadcaster in 1971. The BBC adapted the book for a six-part TV mini-series Man of Straw, broadcast in 1972, with Derek Jacobi as Hessling. References External links * The Patrioteer.

He is the founder of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund based in Setauket-East Setauket, New York. He and his fund are known to be quantitative investors, using mathematical models and algorithms to make investment gains from market inefficiencies. Due to the long-term aggregate investment returns of Renaissance and its Medallion Fund, Simons is described as the \\"greatest investor on Wall Street\\". As reported by Forbes, his net worth is estimated to be $23.5 billion, making him the 24st-richest person in the United States. Outside of finance, Simons is known for his studies on pattern recognition. He developed the Chern‚ÄìSimons form (with Shiing-Shen Chern), and contributed to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory. In 1994, Simons founded the Simons Foundation with his wife to support researches in mathematics and fundamental sciences. He is one of the biggest donors to the University of California, Berkeley, establishing the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in 2012, and to Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, where he serves as a member of the Board of Trustees. In 2016, asteroid 6618 Jimsimons, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1936, was named after Simons by the International Astronomical Union in honor of his contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.IAU Minor Planet Center Early life and education James Harris Simons was born on April 25, 1938 to an American Jewish family, the only child of Marcia (n√©e Kantor)Boston Globe: \\"Marcia (Kantor) Simons Obituary\\" retrieved March 31, 2013. and Matthew Simons, and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts.Bloomberg: \\"Simons at Renaissance Cracks Code, Doubling Assets (Update1)\\" By Richard Teitelbaum November 27, 2007 His father owned a shoe factory, and his mother was a distant relation of Georg Cantor. When James Simons was a teenager, he worked a job in the basement stockroom of a garden supply store. His inefficiency at the job resulted in his demotion to a floor sweeper. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958 and a PhD, also in mathematics, from the University of California, Berkeley, under supervision of Bertram Kostant in 1961, at the age of 23. Academic and scientific career Simons' mathematical work has primarily focused on the geometry and topology of manifolds. His 1962 Berkeley PhD thesis, written under the direction of Bertram Kostant, gave a new proof of Berger's classification of the holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds. He subsequently began to work with Shing-Shen Chern on the theory of characteristic classes, eventually discovering the Chern‚ÄìSimons secondary characteristic classes of 3-manifolds. Later, a mathematical physicist Albert Schwarz discovered early topological quantum field theory which is an application of the Chern‚ÄìSimons form. It is also related to the Yang-Mills functional on 4-manifolds, and has had an effect on modern physics. These and other contributions to geometry and topology led to Simons becoming the 1976 recipient of the AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry. In 2014, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. In 1964, Simons worked with the National Security Agency to break codes. Between 1964 and 1968, he was on the research staff of the Communications Research Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and taught mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, ultimately joining the faculty at Stony Brook University. From 1968 to 1978, he was appointed chairman of the math department at Stony Brook University. Simons was asked by IBM in 1973 to attack the block cipher Lucifer, an early but direct precursor to the Data Encryption Standard (DES). Simons founded Math for America, a nonprofit organization, in January 2004 with a mission to improve mathematics education in United States public schools by recruiting more highly qualified teachers. Investment career =Renaissance Technologies= For more than two decades, Simons' Renaissance Technologies' hedge funds, which trade in markets around the world, have employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many automated. Renaissance uses computer-based models to predict price changes in financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions. Medallion, the main fund which is closed to outside investors, has earned over $100 billion in trading profits since its inception in 1988. This translates to a 66.1% gross return or a 39.1% average net return between 1988 - 2018. Renaissance Technologies manages three other funds - Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund - which, as of April 2019, totalled approximately $55 billion in combined assets and were open to outside investors. Renaissance employs specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. The firm's latest fund is the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF). RIEF has historically trailed the firm's better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that contains only the personal money of the firm's executives. > \\"It's startling to see such a highly successful mathematician achieve > success in another field,\\" says Edward Witten, professor of physics at the > Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and considered by many > of his peers to be the most accomplished theoretical physicist alive. In 2006, Simons was named Financial Engineer of the Year by the International Association of Financial Engineers. In 2007, he was estimated to have personally earned $2.8 billion, $1.7 billion in 2006, $1.5 billion in 2005 (the largest compensation among hedge fund managers that year), and $670 million in 2004. On October 10, 2009, Simons announced he would retire on January 1, 2010 but remain at Renaissance as nonexecutive chairman.  Personal life  Simons shuns the limelight and rarely gives interviews, citing Benjamin the Donkey in Animal Farm for explanation: \\"God gave me a tail to keep off the flies. But I'd rather have had no tail and no flies.\\" In 1996, his son Paul, aged 34, was riding a bicycle, when he was killed by a car on Long Island. In 2003, his son Nicholas, aged 24, drowned on a trip to Bali, Indonesia. His son Nat Simons is an investor and philanthropist.  Political and economic views  Simons is a major contributor to Democratic Party political action committees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Simons was ranked the #5 donor to federal candidates in the 2016 election cycle, coming behind co-CEO Robert Mercer, who ranked #1 and generally donates to Republicans. Simons has donated $7 million to Hillary Clinton's Priorities USA Action,Who are the Super PACs' Biggest Donors? By Al Shaw, ProPublica. Updated December 7, 2012 $2.6 million to the House and Senate Majority PACs, and $500,000 to EMILY's List. He also donated $25,000 to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's super PAC. Since 2006 Simons has contributed about $30.6 million to federal campaigns. Since 1990, Renaissance Technologies has contributed $59,081,152 to federal campaigns and since 2001, has spent $3,730,000 on lobbying as of 2016. In August 2020 Simons donated $1.5 million to the Senate Majority PAC, a democratic super-PAC. Controversies According to The Wall Street Journal in May 2009, Simons was questioned by investors on the dramatic performance gap of Renaissance Technologies' portfolios. The Medallion Fund, which has been available exclusively to current and past employees and their families, surged 80% in 2008 in spite of hefty fees; the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), owned by outsiders, lost money in both 2008 and 2009; RIEF declined 16% in 2008. On July 22, 2014, Simons was subject to bipartisan condemnation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the use of complex basket options to shield day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher ordinary income tax rates) as long-term capital gains. \\"Renaissance Technologies was able to avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes by disguising its day-to- day stock trades as long term investments,\\" said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee's ranking Republican, in his opening statement. An article published in The New York Times in 2015 said that Simons was involved in one of the biggest tax battles of the year, with Renaissance Technologies being \\"under review by the I.R.S. over a loophole that saved their fund an estimated $6.8 billion in taxes over roughly a decade.\\"  Wealth  In 2014, Simons reportedly earned US$1.2 billion including a share of his firm's management and performance fees, cash compensation and stock and option awards. According to Forbes magazine Simons had a net worth of $18 billion in 2017, making him #24 on the Forbes 400 richest people list. In 2018, he was ranked 23rd by Forbes, and in October 2019, his net worth was estimated to be $21.6 billion.Forbes: \\"The World's Billionaires: Jim Simons\\" October 2019 In March 2019, he was named one of the highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders by Forbes. Simons owns a motor yacht, named Archimedes. It was built at the Dutch yacht builder Royal Van Lent and delivered to Simons in 2008.  Philanthropy  Simons and his second wife, Marilyn Hawrys Simons, co-founded the Simons Foundation in 1994, a charitable organization that supports projects related to education and health, in addition to scientific research. The Simons Foundation established the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) in 2003 as a scientific initiative within the Simons Foundation's suite of programs. SFARI's mission is to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. In 2004, Simons founded Math for America with an initial pledge of $25 million from the Simons Foundation, a pledge he later doubled in 2006. Through the foundation, Simons has been a major benefactor of the University of California, Berkeley. On July 1, 2012, the Simons Foundation pledged $60 million to Berkeley to establish the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, the world's leading institute for collaborative research in theoretical computer science. The foundation has also made other major gifts to Berkeley, notably to its Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. The Simons Foundation established the Flatiron Institute in 2016, to house 4 groups of computational scientists (each with 60 or more PhD level researchers). The institute consists of four cores or departments: CCB (the center for computational biology), CCA (Center for Computational Astrophysics), CCQ (Center for Computational Quantum mechanics), and CCM (Center for Computational Mathematics). The new institute is located in Manhattan and represents a major investment in basic computational science. Via the foundation, Simons and his wife funded the renovation of the building housing the mathematics department at MIT, which in 2016 was named after the two of them. In memory of his son Paul, whom he had with his first wife, Barbara Simons, he established Avalon Park, a nature preserve in Stony Brook. In 1996, 34-year-old Paul was killed by a car driver while riding a bicycle near the Simons home. Another son, Nick Simons, drowned at age 24 while on a trip to Bali in Indonesia in 2003. Nick had worked in Nepal. The Simons have become large donors to Nepalese healthcare through the Nick Simons Institute. In 2006, Simons donated $25 million to Stony Brook University through the Stony Brook Foundation, the largest donation ever to a State University of New York school at the time. On February 27, 2008, then Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced a $60 million donation by the Simons Foundation to found the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook, the largest gift to a public university in New York state history.  Legacy and awards  In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen. He was named by the Financial Times in 2006 as \\"the world's smartest billionaire\\". In 2011, he was included in the 50 Most Influential ranking of Bloomberg Markets Magazine. A book about Simons and his investing methods, The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman was released November 5, 2019.

The band included Dan Wilson and John Munson, who would later go on to be founding members of Semisonic. Origins The band originated when Harvard University English student Matt Wilson (guitar/vocals) teamed up with Elaine Harris (drums), a Harvard grad student in biological anthropology, in the early 1980s. Harris had responded to a notice posted by Wilson seeking \\"wicked percussion hands.\\" Matt Wilson and Munson had played together in an earlier band (E Brown), and Wilson had not been impressed by his bass playing, so he didn't want Munson to audition for the new band. \\"But he came over anyway and played, and he'd improved a lot,\\" Wilson later recalled. \\"We ended up begging him to just give it a try and stay around.\\"Craig MacInnis, \\"Behold Pop's Extravagant Toolmasters,\\" Toronto Star,\\" October 18, 1991, p. D3. In 1986 drummer Tim Rowe, who had played with Munson in several other bands, joined the group as percussionist. They performed as a quartet for several months before Rowe left the band during the recording of Applehead Man to join The Nietzsches with the former guitarist for E. Brown, Jimmy Harry.Calendar, City Pages March 5, 1986.Michael Welch, \\"Out Loud,\\" City Pages, January 28, 1987. Matt Wilson originally proposed that the band be named Kirk Shakespeare, after two of his heroes: James T. Kirk and William Shakespeare. \\"I think maybe John and Elaine didn't want to be in a band named after Matt's two heroes, so they changed Kirk to Trip,\\" explained Dan Wilson, Matt's older brother, who joined the band later. \\"What About That Name?\\", Trip Shakespeare: The Mystery In an interview with the Chicago Reader's Bill Wyman, Matt Wilson suggested that Dan was convinced to join by the quality and potential suggested by Applehead Man: \\"We sent him the first record almost as a demo tape, to get him to join up, and kept telling him how serious we were.\\"  History  = Applehead Man = In 1986, the trio self-released their debut album. \\"The first album, Applehead Man, we just put all the songs we knew on there,\\" Matt Wilson later said.MacInnis, p. D3. One of these was the title track, which described a head being carved from \\"the brightest fruit...furthest from the road on the apple farm.\\"Matt Wilson, Applehead Man. = Are You Shakespearienced? = With its lineup complete, the band released a follow-up album, Are You Shakespearienced?, on the Minneapolis-based independent label Gark Records in 1988. Recorded live in the studio without headsets,David Surkamp, \\"Trip Shakespeare\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 10, 1991, p. 8 (Calendar). the album featured \\"Toolmaster of Brainerd,\\" a song that \\"insanely links dairyland folklore with the enduring rock myth of guitar- hero supremacy.\\" Hailing from \\"Brainerd where the children go to milking school,\\" the Toolmaster :learned to play the Gibson that his dog had found :And he came to haunt the bars of Minneapolis town.Favorite Lyrics, Vegan Represent. \\"Toolmaster,\\" according to Minneapolis City Pages, \\"perfectly captured the tension between Minneapolis ambition and outstate resignation that pretty much informs life in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\\"G.R. Anderson Jr. et al., \\"Minnesota's Fifty Greatest Hits\\" , Minneapolis City Pages,\\" June 8, 2005. = Across the Universe = The next year they signed with A&M; Records. The label \\"really gave us a chance,\\" Matt Wilson later said: \\"They spent a lot of money on us making the records. A lot of people at the label genuinely seemed to love the band. The president of the label showed up at our gigs and got all psyched up and said this was not a vanity project on the part of the label. They really thought that we could sell some records. They really thought they could mass market Trip Shakespeare. The band's first release on A&M; was Across the Universe, released in 1990. The album's was titled in homage to the Beatles song of the same name. Matt Wilson later explained: :There's a part of us that's plainly trying to make epic, gorgeous music that can be admired on at least a couple of levels. And there's another part of us that's embarrassed about that, because there are people who will say: \\"Rock 'n' roll is supposed to be simple, three-chord stuff like Keith Richards plays.\\" But when you get right down to it, I guess we find ourselves more in the Beatles' school than in the Rolling Stones'. TrouserPress.com called Across the Universe a \\"too-rare example of an indie act benefiting musically from major-label treatment\\"‚Äîciting an \\"increased rock edge that doesn't detract from the gentle charm\\" of tracks like \\"Snow Days,\\" \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\" and \\"The Crane\\"‚Äîthe latter being the closest thing the album had to a hit.Scott Schinder, \\"Trip Shakespeare\\", TrouserPress.com. The band members were less satisfied with the results. \\"We did not succeed on Across the Universe, Matt Wilson later said.Surkamp, p. 8 (Calendar). \\"There was kind of a compromise between what the label wanted on there and what the band wanted.\\" \\"If anyone was satisfied by that compromise, it wasn't the record-buying public.\\" Across the Universe sold only 33,000 copies. = Lulu = Trip Shakespeare's final major release was 1991's Lulu. Upon its release, Matt Wilson declared: \\"On Lulu, we finally got it right. We got the order of songs down, and spent a lot of time honing it and making it an emotional journey. We wanted the listener to be completely moved and left breathless by the music.\\" In another interview, he called it \\"the first record where we actually had our heads together well enough‚Äîand a had a sense of who we were, enough‚Äîto try to control it.\\" This approach appeared to succeed, drawing positive commentary from critics. AllMusic.com called the album a \\"melodically complex and romantic pop masterpiece,\\" and \\"an album so steeped in worshipping beauty that no amount of criticism‚Äîpositive or negative-‚Äîcan mangle or tarnish its crystalline brilliance.\\" In spite of the warm reception, Lulu was another disappointment in terms of sales, moving 60,000 copies. = Volt = After assembling a demo for a proposed fifth album of cover songs, A&M; approached their promotions department, whose response upon hearing the album was \\"What do we do with this?\\" according to Munson. The label then dropped the band; the covers album was released by Twin/Tone as Volt in 1992. Trip Shakespeare's commercial failure has been attributed to the band's poor timing: \\"1991 was the great embrasure of the grunge movement when Nirvana's Nevermind set the decade-long trend for the popular music charts,\\" wrote AllMusic.com. \\"The release of a melodically complex and romantic pop masterpiece with lush vocals was entertained by neither the critics nor the masses.\\" Wayne Isaak, the head of A&M;'s New York office, put it, \\"Trip Shakespeare is too pop to catch on as an alternative band; the alternative scene is very cliquish.\\" =Breakup= The band broke up shortly after the release of Lulu. The Wilson brothers and Munson continue to play together in various projects. Matt Wilson joined various Minneapolis bands. Munson and Matt Wilson performed as The Flops, later renamed The Twilight Hours; Matt Wilson contributed some vocals and synthesizer work to Semisonic's All About Chemistry album; Matt Wilson joined Semisonic on December 12 and 13, 2003 to play a set of Trip Shakespeare favorites for sold-out crowds at First Avenue in Minneapolis. Munson and both Wilsons reunited in October 2010 to perform for a benefit concert. Dan Wilson and John Munson joined Jacob Slichter to form Pleasure, which was later named Semisonic, Elaine Harris returned to the Boston area and had not been involved in any post-Trip Shakespeare events until The New Standards' December 7, 2013 holiday show, when she joined John, Matt, and Dan for two songs, \\"Susannah\\", and \\"Snow Days.\\" Near the end of the band's run, Matt Wilson said that the band's goal was \\"to be a part of that one or two nights that everybody has in their life when the music is ridiculously good and the people around you are laughing their heads off and losing their minds.... We don't get it every night because you can't carry that kind of ecstasy around with you in a bucket. All we do is try to find that delirious point.\\" =Reunion= On December 7, 2013, Trip Shakespeare reunited to play two songs at The New Standards' 8th annual holiday show. This was the first time the primary lineup of the band had played together live in over 20 years. =Honors and awards= Trip Shakespeare's star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First AvenueThe band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. Dan Wilson and Munson's subsequent group, Semisonic, also has a star, making them among the few musicians with multiple stars on the mural.

He helped to suppress a rebellion by the prince Zhu Gaoxu in 1426 and earned the favour of the Xuande Emperor (r. 1425‚Äì1435), who appointed him as the Grand Coordinator of Shanxi and Henan. During the reign of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435‚Äì1449), he offended the influential court eunuch Wang Zhen and ended up being imprisoned. However, he was released later, reinstated as an official, and further promoted to serve as the Minister of War. In 1449, Yu Qian played an important role in leading the defence of the Ming capital, Beijing, from attacks by the Oirat Mongols, who had earlier captured the Zhengtong Emperor at the Battle of Tumu. The Jingtai Emperor (r. 1449‚Äì1457), who succeeded the Zhengtong Emperor, appointed Yu Qian as the Crown Prince's Guardian and Tutor.

Early life  Born in Scotland, McKenzie emigrated to Canada about 1800. He and two or three of his brothers became involved in the fur trade and were engaged with the North West Company. In 1810, he left the employ of the North West Company to become a partner in the Pacific Fur Company (PFC), financed solely by John Jacob Astor.  Pacific Fur Company  McKenzie traveled west from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific Northwest with an expedition of fellow PFC employees. The group divided after experiencing hard times in southern Idaho. McKenzie‚Äôs fraction, consisting of twelve total, struck north, eventually finding the Salmon River and Clearwater River. They proceeded down the lower Snake River and Columbia River by canoe, and were the first of the Overland Astorians to reach Fort Astoria, on January 18, 1812. McKenzie spent two years exploring and trading for the Pacific Fur Company in the Willamette Valley, along the Columbia River, in eastern Washington and in northern and central Idaho. When the PFC sold its assets and stations to the North West Company in 1813, McKenzie was appointed to carry all important papers back east, which he did in 1814.  Fort Nez Perc√©s and Idaho explorations  After a short time, McKenzie became reacquainted with the North West Company, and returned to the Columbia region in 1816. In 1818, he and Alexander Ross built Fort Nez Perc√©s near the confluence of the Columbia River and Walla Walla River. McKenzie and his trappers made the first extensive exploration of what is now southern Idaho starting in 1818, with annual expeditions continuing through 1821. His trapping ventures covered most of present-day southern Idaho as well as parts of eastern Oregon, northern Utah and western Wyoming. Many of the names for rivers in this region can be traced to this period.  Governor of the Red River Colony  With the merger of the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company in 1821, McKenzie was appointed Governor of the Red River Colony. He left the Pacific Northwest and moved to Fort Garry for a decade, serving as governor of the area including most of present-day Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, Canada.  Legacy  In 1834, McKenzie retired and moved to Mayville, New York, where he lived for the next two decades. Among the distinguished visitors McKenzie entertained and advised were Daniel Webster and William H. Seward, both of whom later served as United States Secretary of State. He gave advice on where the international boundary should be established for Oregon, and also may have planted the seeds that led to the purchase of Alaska from Russia. McKenzie Pass and the McKenzie River in Oregon are named for him.

Success came quickly to the band and their first album, Fourth from the Last, was a sleeper hit, unexpectedly having had the strongest debut of any Christian album to date for its distributor. They toured the United States several times with a variety of artists. Touring highlights include Pope John Paul II's 1999 visit to St. Louis and dc Talk's Supernatural support tour. Their mix of \\"swing pop\\" and ska was uncommon in the Christian music industry. They were more popular within Christian music than their neo-swing counterparts such as the Squirrel Nut Zippers or The Brian Setzer Orchestra. Their songwriting was known for its irreverence and frivolity and for its reflections of the band's faith. Before breaking up in 2000, the group released two albums, topped Christian rock radio and sales charts, and won two Gospel Music Association awards. History The W's formed as a ska band at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon in 1996. The lineup consisted of Andrew Schar (lead vocals, guitar), Valentine Hellman (tenor saxophone, clarine), Todd Gruener (bass guitar), and Zak Shultz (drums). All were attending Oregon State and were residents of Avery Lodge. The band was spearheaded and envisioned by Shultz, but he moved to Seattle to work for Brandon Ebel with Tooth & Nail Records. By September 1997 Shultz had left, and the group was joined by Bret Barker (trumpet), who Schar met through Campus Crusade for Christ, and James Carter (alto saxophone, background vocals). Peter Kelly drummed during middle to the end of 1997, but he broke his arm in a skateboarding accident a few days before recording. Kelly stayed in Philomath, Oregon, got married, and became a youth leader.> The band then recruited Brian Morris to replace Kelly from a local punk band. The W's discovered a break when a mutual friend from Eugene, Aaron James (employed at the time by Five Minute Walk Records), offered them a spot opening for Five Iron Frenzy in Concord, California. Following the CD release party for Five Iron Frenzy's Our Newest Album Ever! in November 1997, they signed with Frank Tate's Five Minute Walk Records. Within a year they produced their first album, Fourth from the Last. The album was released when neo-swing was popular. In its opening week it sold almost 9,000 units, representing over half of the total stock that had been manufactured. This was the highest- selling band debut to date of any album for Five Minute Walks's distributor, Chordant. This also placed Fourth at the No. 4 spot on both Billboard's Heatseekers and Top Contemporary Christian charts. Despite being pulled from the shelves of LifeWay Christian Resources stores for containing \\"indecent\\" words The W's sold over 31,000 copies in five weeks, and eventually over 200,000 units, peaking at No. 147 on The Billboard 200. Fourth from the Last received the Dove Award for Modern Rock Album of the Year in 1999. \\"The Devil Is Bad\\" was The W's hit single from the record. It peaked at No. 1 and No. 6 on the Christian rock and hits radio and charts respectively, and won the Dove for Modern Rock Recorded Song in 1999. The song was also released on the double Platinum certified annual compilation WOW 1999. The W's appeared on 7ball in November 1998. In late 1998 the band appeared on the cover of 7ball magazine (pictured left), representing the widest media coverage the band garnered throughout their career. The cover reflects the visual signature of the band at the time. Fourth from the Last was themed around bowling, a sport which band member had mixed feelings about. At least one member (Todd Gruener) was said to hate the sport, while Andrew Schar had played in a league. Closing out 1998, the band played some dates with one of their mainstream counterparts, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and alternative band Cracker. They played at Pope John Paul II's visit to St. Louis in January. Note: They played to crowds outside the main venue. From late that month until May the band opened for Christian rock group dc Talk on their Supernatural Experience tour. During this time \\"Moses\\" entered Christian radio as a second single and peaked at No. 3 on the Christian rock radio charts. That May the band went into the studio to record their second and final album, Trouble With X. Summer brought further touring and appearances at Christian music festivals.\\"The W's: Tour Schedule\\", now hosted at the Internet Archive. That fall the band embarked on the national Holy Roller Tour with The Insyderz, Five Iron Frenzy, and Justin McRoberts.Holy Roller Tour handbill. Retrieved November 15, 2006.. Shows on this tour were held at roller skating rinks across the country. In November Trouble With X was released, peaking at No. 21 and No. 25 on the Billboard Heatseekers and Top Contemporary Christian charts respectively. Some copies of Trouble With X included \\"The Rumor Weed Song\\", which was made for the episode Larry-Boy and the Rumor Weed of the children's video series VeggieTales. The song was also included on the WOW 2000 compilation, which also achieved double Platinum sales. Touring continued in 2000 alongside labelmates Five Iron Frenzy, Philmore, and Soul-Junk. Drummer Brian Morris departed and was replaced by Courtney Stubbert. The W's commenced recording for a third album, though it was never released. One song from the sessions, \\"Somewhere Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" was released on the compilation Take Time to Listen Volume 5.\\"The W's Music\\". Retrieved November 15, 2006. The W's broke up in December 2000, citing artistic differences. =After the break-up= Some members continued to produce music following the demise of The W's. Gruener and Morris joined Corvallis friend Mark Cleaver in the indie band Bendixon.Bendixon Biography. Now hosted at the Internet Archive. Bendixon released two albums, Bendixon (1999) and Slaying of the Dragon (2000). Their sound was comparable to Weezer or All Star United, and like The W's most of their songs could be considered fun or witty. Schar and Stubbert formed the band Alpha CharlieThe W's News, formerly hosted at nerdmusic.com. Now hosted at the Internet Archive. and released one album, ...and I wait (2002), before breaking up in 2004.Alpha-charlie.com, now hosted at the Internet Archive. Early member Shultz moved to Los Angeles in 1997. Bret Barker and Valentine Hellman appeared on Five Iron Frenzy's 2000 album All the Hype That Money Can Buy. Barker appeared on Dennis Culp's solo album, Ascents (2000), Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo (2001) in both the additional musician credits and as a recording engineer, and as an engineer on The End Is Near (2003). Barker joined The O.C. Supertones in 2004 and played with them until their breakup the following year. Style The music of The W's is similar to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue, and The O.C. Supertones, but less ska-based than the latter. HM Magazine commented that \\"the closest thing in the Christian market was Ralph Carmichael's big band project\\" (Strike Up the Band, 1995). Though they were often cited as third wave ska or swing revival, their overall sound did not fit neatly into any musical genre. Band members generally agreed with this assessment: Andrew Schar noted that \\"Our music gets labeled swing, but we're not really swing\\", and sax player James Carter, \\"I think 'swing' and 'ska' are just terms people are comfortable using. I don't think they completely describe the music we play at all\\". Bass player Gruener described their music as \\"kinda ska, kinda swing, kinda rockabilly, kinda crazy, kinda punky\\". Cross Rhythms provides the most concise explanation: \\"This is Swing Ska!\\". Reviewers, who noted a lack of depth in songwriting, regarded both of The W's albums as \\"fun\\". CCM reported that lyrically, their songs \\"swing between subtle spirituality and general goofiness.\\" Elsewhere this style was described as \\"an odd marriage of reverence for God with forced attempts at irreverent wackiness.\\" While the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music cites this as a \\"subdued approach to ministry\\", other commentators saw it as a disappointing lack of spiritual message, especially on Trouble With X. Trouble was much more themed on Christianity than their debut, although its nature was philosophical rather than spiritual. Characterized by James Carter, \\"The last album, we wrote about our everyday lives... the majority of the songs were about skateboarding and stories we made up. This album, pretty much every song is about Christianity.\\" The band leveled criticism at the church and Christians generally, sometimes using sarcasm, reminding one reviewer of Steve Taylor. \\"Tip from Me\\" is about breaking broad perceptions of Christianity and the Church. The purpose of the song was to acknowledge problems with the church, say to the non-Christian that \\"Yeah, we see the problems too,\\" and a call to the Christian to act to fix them. In the song \\"Stupid\\" the band used the example of abortion clinic bombings (see, for example Eric Robert Rudolph) to make a pronounced statement about hypocrisy. Several songs draw directly from biblical stories. The song \\"Moses\\" is about struggles with faith and insignificance. It draws inspiration from several biblical figures and stories, including Moses' Burning bush, Gideon, Peter's denial of Christ, and Paul's role in the death of Stephen to show how God can use anybody for his purposes. \\"Used Car Salesman\\" paints a colorful description of the Devil, selling sins as used Hondas. Other songs, such as \\"Dexter\\", and \\"Frank\\" retell parts of the lives of band members. \\"J.P.\\" tells about how a friend of Valentine Hellman encouraged him to leave the party scene and rededicate his life to Christ. \\"Hui\\" retells the 1987 film North Shore. More mundane topics include the hardships of school (\\"101\\") and of touring and making music professionally (\\"Two More Weeks\\", \\"Open Minded\\"). Another notable song was their cover of John Denver's \\"Country Roads\\", which some thought worked well as a swing tune.

The Act was the first legislative step in the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature, and was indicative of the moral, social and educative concerns of the time. The legacy of the Act can be followed through subsequent legislation that built on and expanded the powers granted in 1850 and the 4,145LISU (2015) Retrieved 6 June 2016 public libraries that exist in the United Kingdom in the 21st century can trace their origins back to this Act. Historical background In the 1830s, at the height of the Chartist movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. This prompted much new legislation to be passed, such as the Parliamentary Reform Act 1832, the Factory Act 1833, the first instance of a Government grant for education in the same year and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The Capitalist economic model had created shift patterns which left workers with free time, in contrast to the agrarian model, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers‚Äô free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.McMenemy (2009), pp. 24‚Äì26 Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good. In 1835, and against government opposition, James Silk Buckingham, MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the temperance movement, was able to secure the Chair of the select committee which would examine \\"the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom\\" and propose solutions. Francis Place, a campaigner for the working class, agreed that \\"the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford\\".Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, Report (1834) Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on William Ewart MP and Joseph Brotherton MP, who introduced a bill which would \\"[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a d for the establishment of museums\\".Kelly & Kelly (1977), p. 77 This became the Museums Act 1845. 1849 Select Committee The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. A paper entitled \\"A statistical view of the principal public libraries in Europe and the United States\\" by Edward Edwards, an assistant at the British Museum Library, came to Ewart's attention and Edwards became a key witness to the select committee. Edwards was \\"a self taught former bricklayer ... passionately convinced of the value and significance of libraries\\".Sturges (1996), p. 30 The select committee of 1849 produced a report in which Edwards and Ewart ensured that \\"no stone was left unturned\\"Kelly (1973), p. 12 in proving their case that existing public library provision was inadequate and that provision in other countries was far superior. The Select Committee reported that \\"while we learn that, more than half a century ago, the first step taken by a foreign writer was to consult a public library on the subject of his studies or composition; we find that no such auxiliary was at the service of the British intellect\\".Select Committee on Public Libraries, Report (1849) The Report also argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits, the same argument as was made by James Silk Buckingham fifteen years earlier. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made certain proposals, including: * public use of university libraries * improved public access to the British Museum Library * duplicate books from the British Museum Library collection to be redistributed to local libraries In order to achieve such ends, the committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.Minto (1932) chapters 3‚Äì4Murison (1971) chapter 2 However, it was not thought necessary to subsidise stock provision for the libraries so the levy was to be used to provide buildings, furnishings and staff salaries. The authors of the report believed that donations from members of the public would be more than adequate to stock the new libraries. Public Libraries Act 1850 The 1850 Act was much more contentious than the Museums Act 1845. The major arguments against the Bill included: * Although the boroughs were represented by elected bodies, many people argued that the Act enforced taxation without consent. * There was opposition to the Act simply on the grounds that founding and maintaining the new libraries would mean an increase in taxation at all, consensual or otherwise. * Concerns were expressed that it would infringe on private enterprise and the existing library provision such as mechanics' institutes. * Access to certain publications would neither promote civil society nor act as a form of social control, and libraries would instead become sites of social agitation. This issue was linked to the common concern that extending education to the lower orders of society would lead to libraries becoming working class \\"lecture halls\\" \\"which would give rise to an unhealthy agitation\\".Hansard (1850) Col. 848 * Others felt that there were more pressing concerns, and wondered about the necessity for a library when literacy levels were so low. In contrast many people favoured it, provided there was a cap on the level of taxation, on the grounds that: * Public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, not just those who were wealthy enough to afford their own private libraries and collections. * The greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower crime rates. In order to get the Bill passed through Parliament, a number of concessions had to be made to its original content. The compromises made included limiting the Act to boroughs with populations of more than 10,000 where at least two-thirds of local ratepayers had to vote in favour of provision in a local referendum.Public Libraries Act, 13 & 14 Vict., c. 65 The Bill would repeal the Museums Act 1845 and so, in order to continue funding museums of arts and science as well as the new free libraries, local rates could be increased, but by no more than d per ¬£1. As stated in the Bill however, it was only permitted to spend this levy on library and museum buildings and staff but not on books and other stock. Scottish provision The Public Libraries Act 1850 initially applied only to England and Wales, but it was extended to Scotland in 1853 and there was a further Act, the Public Libraries (Scotland) Act, the following year when library authorities were granted the right to raise the rate by 1d. and to spend money on books, maps and specimens as well as on library and museum buildings. In addition to this, it was no longer necessary for there to be a poll of ratepayers for the Act to be adopted and uptake was instead authorised by a two-thirds majority at a public meeting of those who possessed or occupied a house of ¬£10 annual value.Public Libraries (Scotland) Act, 17 & 18 Vict. c. 64 This referred to homes that might reasonably be expected to have a net annual rental value of ¬£10 a year or more. However, a poll could still be requested by any five voters present. In 1855, similar amendments were introduced in England and Wales in a more wide-ranging Act. This included provision for the 1d rate and the authority to buy books, newspapers, maps and specimens. It also contained the amendment that had already been made in Scotland, that of the two-thirds majority at a public meeting of ratepayers. Further legislation The 1850 Act was noteworthy because it established the principle of free public libraries, but in practice it was unsatisfactory. It placed many limitations on the type of councils that could adopt it, the amount of money that the boroughs were permitted to spend and the ways in which this money could be spent. Efforts were later made to develop the Act further and remove many of these restrictions. In 1855, the maximum rate that boroughs could charge to fund libraries was increased to 1d. Like the 1850 Act, this Bill had to be guided through the House of Commons by William Ewart. It met with a great deal of opposition and Ewart was obliged to abandon a proposal to enable municipal boroughs to adopt it by simple resolution of the town council. There was some confusion regarding the provision of public libraries outside corporate towns, that is those towns incorporated by legal enactment and entitled to pass by-laws and use a common seal. This resulted in difficulties in extending public library provision to rural areas. The 1855 Act tried to resolve these difficulties by stating that a library authority could be a borough council, an improvement board or commission, a parish vestry or group of vestries, provided they covered a minimum population of 5,000.Public Libraries and Museums Act, 18 & 19 Vict. c. 70 Since the 18th century, improvement boards had been established in many urban areas to take responsibility for paving, lighting and cleaning of streets, but over time their functions became wider in scope. From 1835 onwards, their responsibilities were assumed by elected town councils in the reformed boroughs but they continued in the urban areas outside the boroughs. Becoming a public library authority was another extension of their authority. In 1866, an amending Act was passedPublic Libraries Amendment Act, 29 & 30 Vict. c.114 which eliminated entirely the population limit and replaced the two-thirds majority previously required for adoption with a simple majority. It also allowed neighbouring parishes to combine with an existing or potential library authority. This Act covered Scotland, England and Wales and in 1867 another Act was passed in ScotlandPublic Libraries (Scotland) Act, 30 & 31 Vict. c. 37 to amend and consolidate it, which established a form of library committee composed of a maximum of twenty members, of which half were to be members of the council and the other half to be selected by the council from householders.Kelly (1973), p. 21 Legacy The Public Library Acts of 1855 and 1866 were the last to be advanced by William Ewart, who retired in 1868. He had made great efforts to promote the public library system in Great Britain and perhaps his greatest achievement was the complete elimination of the population limits, as it allowed even very small towns or parishes to set up a public library. It was later found that this could present a problem, but as many public libraries were established by library authorities that did not in fact have enough money to run a library satisfactorily. Despite the rise in the level of tax public libraries could levy, it was still very difficult for boroughs to raise enough capital to fund new libraries. The growth of the public library movement in the wake of the 1850 Act relied heavily on the donations of philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie, John Passmore Edwards and Henry Tate.Kelly (1973), pp. 107‚Äì137 See also * Public library *Public Libraries Act References Notes Bibliography * LISU.

The battle included the Battle of Loos by the British First Army. The offensive, meant to complement the Second Battle of Champagne, was the last attempt of 1915 by Joseph Joffre, the French commander-in-chief, to exploit an Allied numerical advantage over Germany. Simultaneous attacks were planned in Champagne-Ardenne to capture the railway at Attigny and in Artois to take the line through Douai to force a German withdrawal from the Noyon salient. Background Joffre's plan was a series of attacks along the Western Front, supported by Italian attacks across the Isonzo River and a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) attack near Loos-en- Gohelle. At first, Field Marshal John French and General Sir Douglas Haig opposed the attack, because of the lay of the land, a lack of heavy artillery, ammunition and reserves. The generals were over-ruled by the British minister of war, Lord Horatio Kitchener, who ordered French and Haig to conduct the offensive. Prelude The Tenth Army massed seventeen infantry and two cavalry divisions for the offensive, backed by guns and artillery pieces. The 6th Army had about thirteen divisions and from the French field artillery fired rounds of ammunition and the heavy artillery at the German defences. Obsolete 90 mm guns were used to fire another Battle An artillery bombardment began on 21 September, and on 25 September the Tenth Army attacked at to be sure that the morning mist had dispersed. XXI Corps attacked the rest of Souchez village and La Folie farm, XXXIII Corps made some progress but the III and XII corps to the south was repulsed. On the XXI Corps front, the 13th Division, attacking near Souchez with had casualties of in the first few days. During the afternoon it began to rain, impeding artillery observation and attack times were altered to even later in the day, which made co-ordination with the British First Army on the northern flank much more difficult. By 26 September, the XXXIII and XXI corps had taken Souchez but the III and XII corps had made little progress south-east of Neuville-St Vaast. The French failed to breach the German second line of defence and a breakthrough could not be achieved. Joffre sent the French IX Corps to assist the British attacks at Loos but this action also yielded little of strategic value. Foch was also ordered by Joffre to conserve infantry and ammunition to reinforce the simultaneous offensive in Champagne; ammunition expenditure in Artois had been so vast that the offensive was to be reduced but without giving the British the impression that they were being left in the lurch. In very wet weather, the Tenth Army captured Vimy Ridge, except for the highest point, where German counter-attacks retook the ground from XXXIII Corps. Foch took over ground on the British right flank but it became impossible to co-ordinate attacks for the same day. The Battle continued until 13 October but ended amidst the autumn rains, mutual exhaustion and inter-Allied recriminations. Aftermath =Analysis= The two French 1915 offensives in Artois had advanced the front line by on a front. After advancing in their previous offensive in May, the French advanced an additional by the end of their September offensive. Fayolle reported that the Third Battle of Artois had been a failure, because of uncut wire and the firepower of German machine-guns and artillery. The success of infantry attacks was dependent on the ability of the artillery to cut the wire, destroy German field fortifications and prevent the German artillery bombarding French infantry by using counter-battery fire; the simultaneous Second Battle of Champagne continued into October. =Casualties= The official historians of the recorded casualties to the end of October. In 2008, Jack Sheldon used figures taken from the French Official History to record fewer than half of the French casualties suffered in the spring offensive from April to June. James Edmonds, the British official historian, recorded and casualties at the Battle of Loos. Elizabeth Greenhalgh wrote that of the casualties, had been killed or listed as missing, against the capture of and many trench mortars and items of equipment.

The first system was initially observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 12\\\\. The last system dissipated on November 6 while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. None of the systems existed simultaneously. Of the season's five tropical cyclones, three reached hurricane status. However, none of them strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Along with 1901, this was the first time that two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since 1864 and 1865. Only one storm left significant impact, which was the second hurricane. It brought flooding and strong winds to Texas, resulting in severe damage in some areas. A tornado spawned by the storm also caused five fatalities. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 28, the lowest value since 1890. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:215 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/2017 till:01/12/2017 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2017 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:12/06/2017 till:16/06/2017 color:TS text:\\"One (TS)\\" from:21/06/2017 till:28/06/2017 color:C1 text:\\"Two (C1)\\" from:16/09/2017 till:22/09/2017 color:C2 text:\\"Three (C2)\\" from:03/10/2017 till:11/10/2017 color:C2 text:\\"Four (C2)\\" from:01/11/2017 till:06/11/2017 color:TS text:\\"Five (TS)\\" barset:break bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/2017 till:01/07/2017 text:June from:01/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 text:July from:01/08/2017 till:01/09/2017 text:August from:01/09/2017 till:01/10/2017 text:September from:01/10/2017 till:01/11/2017 text:October from:01/11/2017 till:01/12/2017 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(618,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale)\\" Systems =Tropical Storm One= In June, a low pressure area was observed over the western Caribbean Sea. At 12:00 UTC on June 12, a tropical depression developed about north of Swan Island, Honduras. The depression moved north- northeastward and intensified into a tropical storm early the next day. Later on June 13, the storm made landfall in modern-day Artemisa Province of Cuba with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). After reaching the Gulf of Mexico late on June 13, the system continued to strengthen and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Around 23:00 UTC, it made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida at the same intensity. After moving inland, the storm moved northeastward and slowly weakened. Around midday on June 16, the system became extratropical over southeastern Virginia and then accelerated northeastward, before dissipating near Anticosti Island, Quebec late on the following day. Some locations in Florida observed tropical storm force winds. In Virginia, the steamer Falcon sank southeast of False Cape. On June 16, the cities of Fredericksburg and New Canton both set 24-hour rainfall records for the month of June, with and observed, respectively. A drought in the area was ended, which particularly benefited tobacco crops. =Hurricane Two= The second observed tropical cyclone of the season developed over Chiapas at 00:00 UTC on June 21\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, the system moved slowly northwestward and reached the Gulf of Mexico early the next day. Around 12:00 UTC on June 23, it strengthened into a tropical storm. While curving north- northwestward, the storm intensified into a hurricane at 00:00 UTC on June 26\\\\. Six hours later, the hurricane attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 80 mph (130 km/h). However, it then began to weaken falling to tropical storm status late on June 26\\\\. At 21:00 UTC that day, the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). After moving inland, the system quickly weakened and became extratropical over Oklahoma by midday on June 28\\\\. The remnants moved rapidly northeastward before dissipating over Pennsylvania the next day. A drought existed in Texas for the previous six weeks. Thus, rainfall produce by this storm was beneficial to cotton and rice. However, withered corn stalks were easily blown down by the wind. Further, heavy precipitation in some areas resulted in flooding. The highest 24-hour rainfall total was at Nacogdoches, setting a daily rainfall record for June. This swelled Lanana and Bonita creeks. All bridges were swept away and communication was cut off, while the south side of town was underwater. At Galveston, of rain fell on June 27, setting a daily rainfall record. Over fell in La Porte, ruining more than of hay west of town. Morgan's Point was under water. In Gregg and Harrison counties, heavy rains washed out the Texas and Pacific railroads. Flooding occurred across the upper Sabine basin as well. Strong winds also buffeted portions of the state, with gusts up to in Galveston. A freight train was blown off the track at East Bernard in Wharton County. A tornado moved northeast through Krasna, near Wallis, killing five people. In El Campo, fruit fell off trees. Windmills and chimneys were blown down in Edna, while in Ganado and Louise, outhouses and barns were destroyed. In Houston, trees were uprooted and outhouses destroyed by the gale. Electric wires were downed. Trees were uprooted and damage to sorghum crops were reported in Lavaca County. The remnants of the storm produced heavy rainfall in Missouri and tornadoes in Indiana. The storm in Great Plains set up a cold and moist easterly wind which caused colder than normal temperatures in Nebraska and a rare late June snowstorm in Denver, Colorado; up to was observed. =Hurricane Three= A tropical storm was first observed at 06:00 UTC on September 16, while located about southwest of Cape Verde, at the most southerly latitude of any tropical-storm-strength cyclone on record. The storm headed west-northwestward for a few days and slowly strengthened. Late on September 19, it accelerated and began curving northwestward. At 00:00 UTC the next day, the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Later on September 20, the hurricane curved northward and then to the northeast. Further deepening occurred, with the storm becoming a Category 2 hurricane early the following day.

The storm began weakening on September 22 and fell to Category 1 intensity. Several hours later, it became extratropical while located about west- southwest of Flores Island in the Azores. The remnants of this storm continued northeastward and weakened, until dissipating about southeast of Cape Farewell, Greenland on September 25\\\\. =Hurricane Four= A tropical depression developed in the Pacific Ocean while located about west-southwest of Tapachula, Chiapas on October 3\\\\. The depression moved slowly north- northwestward and made landfall in a rural area of southeastern Oaxaca early the next day. On October 5, the system reached the Gulf of Mexico and soon intensified into a tropical storm. Thereafter, it curved east-northeastward and strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by October 6\\\\. Early the next day, the storm became a Category 2 hurricane and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, on October 9, the hurricane weakened to a Category 1\\\\. Around 06:00 UTC the following day, the system weakened further to a tropical storm.

The remnants accelerated while moving across the Southeastern United States and eventually emerged into the Atlantic Ocean, before dissipating south of Atlantic Canada on October 13\\\\. Some damage was reported in Tabasco due to gales. Along the eastern Gulf Coast of the United States, strong winds were observed. =Tropical Storm Five= The final storm developed north of Puerto Rico at 00:00 UTC on November 1 as a tropical depression. Initially, it headed northwestward, but re-curved to the northeast about six hours later. By midday on November 1, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm continued to intensify and peaked with sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early on November 3\\\\. Around that time, a ship observed a barometric pressure of , possibly suggesting hurricane intensity. Later on November 5, the storm began heading in a more eastward direction and weakened. At 06:00 UTC the next day, it weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated several hours later, while located about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.

She led the team that created Nickelodeon in the 1980s and 1990s and co-founded Oxygen Media. She is co-founder of a tech startup called Katapult. In 2020, she was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.  Early life and education  Laybourne was raised in Martinsville, a rural community of about 400 in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey. She is the second of four children, born to a former radio writer/actress and community organizer and a stock broker. In 1969, Laybourne earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art History from Vassar College. In 1971, she received a Master of Science degree in Elementary Education from the University of Pennsylvania. Career After college, Laybourne had various jobs. From 1969 to 1970, Laybourne worked at Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd, an architecture firm in Philadelphia. From 1972 to 1973, she worked as a teacher at Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts. Then from 1974 to 1976, Laybourne worked as a festival coordinator of the New York American Film Festival. In 1974, she co-founded the Media Center for Children, which she was involved with until 1977. Laybourne said she founded the Media Center for Children because she was concerned about the media her children were watching. From 1978 to 1980, she was a partner at Early Bird Special Company in New York. = Nickelodeon (1980-1996) = In 1980, Laybourne was hired as a program manager at Nickelodeon, a year-old network, where she initiated the focus-group approach to programming. Laybourne was one of the first people to focus on television programming for kids. She spent 15 years at Nickelodeon, taking over the management of the network, and started accepting advertising for the network, in 1984. Laybourne and her team were responsible for creating and building the Nickelodeon brand, launching Nick at Nite and expanding the network by establishing it in other countries, developing theme parks and creating Nickelodeon magazine, movie, toy and publishing divisions. Under her leadership, Nickelodeon became the top-rated 24-hour cable programming service and won Emmy Awards, Peabody Awards, CableACE Awards and Parents' Choice Awards. The network had a 40% profit margin and explosive growth every year. Laybourne built Nickelodeon into the first global television network to profit from selling advertising targeted towards children. Her programming approach, which made a point of talking to children as equals, built the tiny cable network, which had only five employees in 1980, into an $8 billion business. = Disney (1996-1998) = Laybourne left Nickelodeon in 1996 to become president of Disney-ABC Cable Networks, guiding the growth and overseeing the programming of the Disney Channel and represented the corporate interests in Lifetime, A&E;, E!, and The History Channel. She led the development two projects that did not come to fruition: ABC 24 Hour News cable channel and ABZ, an innovative education channel. Laybourne played a role in the creation and management of ABC‚Äôs Saturday morning children's programming schedule, with the successful launch of One Saturday morning. She's said to have felt stifled by the corporate structure at Disney. = Oxygen Media (1998-2007) = In 1998, Laybourne left Disney and partnered with Oprah Winfrey and Carsey-Werner Productions to create Oxygen Media, a cable TV company dedicated to creating television and Internet programming for women. She also purchased three women- oriented online services from her former MTV boss, Robert W. Pittman. On February 2, 2000 (a date which plays off the chemical compound of oxygen‚ÄîO2/O2), the Oxygen Network premiered to 10 million subscribers. LVMH was an early investor, but left in 2001 when Laybourne changed strategy from being an Internet company to a television company. Laybourne initially hired 700 people, but scaled down to 250. The company went on to become profitable in 2004. Microsoft billionaire, Paul Allen, who invested in three rounds of Oxygen, forced Oxygen's sale in the late 2007 to NBC Universal for $925 million. At the end of Laybourne's tenure, Oxygen had 270,000 prime-time weekday viewers in 74 million homes. = Mentorship = Laybourne started the mentoring program, Global Women's Mentoring Walks, which pairs established and emerging women professionals to engage in mentoring partnerships in communities across the globe. Personal life In 1970, Laybourne married Kit Laybourne, a television producer, entrepreneur, author, and educator.

It symbolises worldly power and holy might and also acts as a sort of mission statement for the reign of a monarch (sometimes it even changed during the reign). The full titulary, consisting of five names, did not come into standard usage until the Middle Kingdom but remained in use as late as the Roman Empire. Origins In order that the pharaoh, who held divine office, could be linked to the people and the gods, special epithets were created for them at their accession to the throne. These titles also served to demonstrate one's qualities and link them to the terrestrial realm. The five names were developed over the centuries beginning with the Horus name. This name identified the figure as a representative of the god Horus. The Nebty name was the second part of the royal titular of Upper and Lower Egypt. This name placed the king under the protection of two female deities, Nekhbet and Wadjet and began sometime towards the end of the First Dynasty as a reference to \\"The one who belongs to Upper and Lower Egypt\\", along with mention of the Two Ladies. Beginning sometime in the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, the Gold Falcon name (sometimes called the Horus of Gold) was created. The last two names of the king, the prenomen and the nomen, were generally depicted within the circular, roped cartouche of the king (eventually the cartouche would contain all royal names, including the queen and the royal children) and were known as the Throne name and the Son of Re name. Horus name **ìÖÉìäÅ** Serekh containing the name of Djet and an association with Wadjet, on display at the Louvre The Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name, originating in prehistoric Egypt. Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 1999, , p. 74-75. The Horus name was usually written in a serekh, a representation of a palace fa√ßade. The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside this representation of a palace. Typically an image of the falcon god Horus was perched on top of or beside it. At least one Egyptian ruler, the Second Dynasty pharaoh Seth-Peribsen, used an image of the god Set instead of Horus, perhaps signifying an internal religious division within the country. He was succeeded by Khasekhemwy, who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above his name. Thereafter, the image of Horus always appeared alongside the name of the pharaoh. By the time of the New Kingdom, the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh. Nebty (\\"two ladies\\") name G16 The Nebty name (lit. \\"two ladies\\") was associated with the so-called \\"heraldic\\" goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt: * Nekhbet, patron deity of Upper Egypt, represented by a vulture, and * Wadjet, patron deity of Lower Egypt, represented by a cobra. The name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet, though it only became a fully independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty. This particular name was not typically framed by a cartouche or serekh, but always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets, the dual noun \\"nebty\\". Horus of Gold G8 Also known as the Golden Horus name, this form of the pharaoh's name typically featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold. The meaning of this particular title has been disputed. One belief is that it represents the triumph of Horus over his uncle Seth, as the symbol for gold can be taken to mean that Horus was \\"superior to his foes\\". Gold also was strongly associated in the ancient Egyptian mind with eternity, so this may have been intended to convey the pharaoh's eternal Horus name. Similar to the Nebty name, this particular name typically was not framed by a cartouche or serekh. Throne name (prenomen) Praenomen of the Cartouche of Thutmose II preceded by Sedge and Bee symbols, Temple of Hatshepsut, Luxor M23:t-L2:t The pharaoh's throne name, the first of the two names written inside a cartouche, usually accompanied the title nsw-bity (nsw(t)-bjt(j)), traditionally interpreted as \\"[He] of sedge [and] bee\\" and often translated for convenience as \\"King of Upper and of Lower Egypt\\". (The sedge and the bee symbolised Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively,Sethe, Kurt (1911) ‚ÄúDas Wort f√ºr K√∂nig von Ober√§gypten‚Äù in Zeitschrift f√ºr √Ñgyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde, vol. 42, issue 1-2Ewa Wasilewska, Creation Stories of the Middle East, 2000, 130f. although recent research has thrown this interpretation into doubt.

Personal name (nomen) G39-N5:.- This was the name given at birth. The name itself was preceded by the title \\"Son of Ra\\", written with the hieroglyph of a duck (za), a homonym for the word meaning \\"son\\" (za), adjacent to an image of the sun, a hieroglyph for the chief solar deity Ra. It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. For women who became pharaoh, the preceding title was interpreted as \\"daughter\\" also. Modern historians typically refer to the ancient kings of Egypt by this name, adding ordinals (e.g. \\"II\\", \\"III\\") to distinguish between different individuals bearing the same name.

The town is located 15 km west of Madrid's city center, in the western zone of the metro area. The Spanish Air Force Museum and the Universidad Europea de Madrid are located within the municipality. Villaviciosa's quiet lifestyle and its proximity to Madrid propitiated rapid and extensive development during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Because of its proximity to the Universidad Europea de Madrid, it has become a university town, with well-developed residential area and amenities for students. The town contains the Castle of Villaviciosa de Od√≥n.  History  The first news of population formed in the vicinity of Villaviciosa are of the Visigoth era as demonstrates the necropolis found when the splitting of the M-501 road from Villaviciosa until Navas del Rey. We also know that there was a population nucleus on the land now occupied by Villaviciosa; it was the old Calatalifa, this name comes from the Arabic ŸÇŸÑÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÑŸäŸÅÿ© Qal\`at al-Khalifa or Castillo del Califa, populated quoted by Ibn Hayyan chronicler in 939, but probably its foundation occurred earlier. Like many other towns in the Community of Madrid, Calatalifa was occupied by Castilian troops during the Reconquista. The Christian advance, after conquering Mayrit (Madrid), ended with the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI. Calatalifa was a settlement of three cultures, Christians, Arabs and Jews at the time, but disappeared towards the end of the thirteenth century. The population reappears in the mid-fifteenth century already with the name of Od√≥n: a handwritten document dated in 1459 attests to a purchase-sale of land and is preserved in the Town Hall. Already in the early eighteenth century the name of Villaviciosa appeared on official documents, and even alternate the two names, as we can see in a decree of Felipe V that designates the area as \\"Real Bosque\\": \\"He venido en declarar que el nuevo Bosque de la villa de Od√≥n o Villaviciosa, que es propio del Ynfante don Felipe, mi hijo, y sus l√≠mites, con sus aumentos o extensiones que en adelante tuviere, son y han de ser Bosque Real, con todos sus privilegios y libertades\\". By 1801, the neighbouring village of Saced√≥n de Canales had been completely depopulated: those left there moved to Villaviciosa. In this year Villaviciosa annexed the territory of the lost town of Saced√≥n de Canales.

The settlement was located on about near the Upper West Side neighborhood, approximately bounded by Central Park West and the paths of 82nd Street, 89th Street and Seventh Avenue, had they been constructed through the park. Seneca Village was founded in 1825 by free Black Americans, the first such community in the city. At its peak, the community had 264 residents, three churches, a school, and two cemeteries. The settlement was later also inhabited by Irish and German immigrants. Seneca Village existed until 1857, when, through eminent domain, the villagers and other settlers in the area were ordered to leave and their houses were torn down for the construction of Central Park. The entirety of the village was dispersed except for one congregation that relocated. Several vestiges of Seneca Village's existence have been found over the years, including two graves and a burial plot. The settlement was largely forgotten until the publication of Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar's book The Park and the People: A History of Central Park in 1992. The Seneca Village Project was formed in 1998 to raise awareness of the village, and several archeological digs have been conducted. In 2001, a historical plaque was unveiled, commemorating the site where Seneca Village once stood. Etymology The origin of Seneca Village's name is uncertain; however, a number of theories have been advanced. # One theory suggests that the word \\"Seneca\\" came from Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, whose book Moral Epistles was often read by African American activists and abolitionists. # The village could have also been named after the Seneca nation of Native Americans. # According to Central Park Conservancy historian Sara Cedar Miller, \\"Seneca\\" could have been an amalgamation of anti-Native American and anti-Black slurs. # Another theory posits that Seneca Village could be named after the West African nation of Senegal, the origin country for many of the village's residents. # The name could have also come from use as a code-word on the Underground Railroad, when fugitive slaves from the Southern United States were being hidden in nearby areas. Existence Map showing the former location of Seneca Village (Egbert Viele, ca. 1857) =Development= The land was originally purchased by a white farmer named John Whitehead in 1824. One year later, Whitehead began selling off smaller lots from his property. At the time, the area was far from the core of New York City, which was centered south of 23rd Street in what is now Lower Manhattan. On September 27, 1825, a young African American man named Andrew Williams purchased three lots from the Whiteheads for $125. On the same day, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AME Zion Church) trustee Epiphany Davis bought twelve lots for $578. The AME Zion Church bought six additional lots the same week, and by 1832, at least 24 lots had been sold to African Americans. Additional nearby development was centered around \\"York Hill\\", a plot bounded by where Sixth and Seventh Avenues would have been built, between 79th and 86th Streets. York Hill was mostly owned by the city, but were purchased by William Matthews, a young African American, in the late 1830s. Matthews's African Union Church also bought land in Seneca Village around that time. More African Americans began moving to Seneca Village after slavery in New York state was outlawed in 1827. In the 1830s, people from York Hill were forced to move so that a basin for the Croton Distributing Reservoir could be built, so many of York Hill's residents migrated to Seneca Village. Later, during the Great Famine of Ireland, many Irish immigrants came to live in Seneca Village, swelling the village's population by 30 percent during this time. Both African Americans and Irish immigrants were marginalized and faced discrimination throughout the city. Despite their social and racial conflicts elsewhere, the African Americans and Irish in Seneca Village lived close to each other. By 1855, one-third of the village's population was Irish. George Washington Plunkitt, who later became a Tammany Hall politician, was born in 1842 to two of the first Irish settlers in the village, Pat and Sara Plunkitt. Richard Croker, who later became the leader of Tammany, was born in Ireland, but he came with his family to Seneca Village in 1846, and lived there until his father received a job that enabled them to move. The one-story frame-and- board houses in Seneca Village were referred to as \\"shanties\\", which reflected their roughshod outward appearance, though some of the houses resembled log cabins. While the houses were not professionally constructed, their interiors were an improvement on the cramped tenements of Lower Manhattan. Land ownership among Black residents was much higher than that in the city as a whole: more than half owned property in 1850, five times the property ownership rate of all New York City residents at the time. One-fifth of Seneca Village's inhabitants owned their residences. Many of Seneca Village's Black residents were landowners and relatively economically secure compared to their downtown counterparts. At least one property owner, the Lyons family, lived in Lower Manhattan but owned property in Seneca Village. Nevertheless, many of the residents were still poor, since they worked in service industries such as construction, day labor, or food service. Only three residents could be considered middle-class, of which two were grocers and the other was an innkeeper. Many Black women worked as domestic servants. Many residents \\"squatted\\", boarding in homes they did not own, demonstrating that there was significant class stratification even with Seneca Village's high land ownership rate. The residents relied on the abundant natural resources nearby, such as fish from the nearby East River and Hudson River, and the firewood from surrounding forests. Some residents also had gardens and barns, and fed their livestock scraps of garbage. There were two bone disposal plants in the vicinity at 66th and 75th Streets. =Inhabitants= In 1855, a New York state census found that Seneca Village had 264 residents. On average, the residents had lived there for 22 years. Three-quarters of the 264 residents recorded in 1855 had lived in Seneca Village since 1840 or before, and nearly all had lived there since 1850. At this time in New York City's history, most of the city's population lived below 14th Street; the region above 59th Street was only sporadically developed and was semi-rural or rural in character. After slavery in New York was outlawed, African American men in the state could vote as long as they had $250 worth of property and had lived in the state for at least three years. Of the 13,000 Black New Yorkers, 91 were qualified to vote, and of the voting-eligible Black population, 10 lived in Seneca Village. The purchase of land by Blacks had a significant effect on their political engagement. Blacks in Seneca Village were extremely politically engaged in proportion to the rest of New York. =Community institutions= The economic and cultural stability of Seneca Village enabled the growth of several community institutions. The village had three churches, two schools, and two cemeteries; by 1855, two-thirds of the inhabitants (180 of 264 total) were regular churchgoers. Two of the churches, First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church of Yorkville and African Union Church, were all-Black churches, while All Angels' Church was racially mixed. The AME Zion Church, a denomination officially established in lower Manhattan in 1821, owned property for burials in Seneca Village beginning in 1827. In 1853, the Church established a congregation and built a church building in Seneca Village. According to the New York Post, the cornerstone included a capsule with \\"a Bible, a hymn book, the church's rules, a letter with the names of its five trustees and copies of the newspapers, The Tribune and The Sun\\". The church building was destroyed as part of the razing of Seneca Village. The African Union Church purchased lots in Seneca Village in 1837, about from AME Zion Church. It had 50 congregants. The church building contained one of the city's few Black schools at the time, Colored School 3, founded in the mid-1840s. One of the teachers in the school was 17-year-old Catherine Thompson. All Angels' Church was founded in 1846 as an affiliate of St. Michael's Episcopal Church, the main campus of which was located at Amsterdam Avenue and 99th Street. All Angels' was intended to be a mission to the residents of Seneca Village and nearby areas. At first, the church was hosted in a white policeman's home, but a wooden church at 84th Street was built in 1849. The congregation was racially diverse, with Black parishioners from Seneca Village and Irish and German parishioners from other nearby areas. It had only 30 parishioners from Seneca Village. When the community was razed, the church relocated a few blocks west and was officially incorporated at the corner of 81st Street and West End Avenue.  Other nearby settlements  Blockhouse No. 1, a structure that predated Central Park While Seneca Village was the largest former settlement in what is now Central Park, it was also surrounded by smaller areas that were occupied mainly by Irish and German immigrants. One of these areas, called \\"Pigtown\\", was a settlement of 14 mostly Irish families located in the modern park's southeastern corner, and was so named because the residents kept hogs and goats. Pigtown was originally located farther south, from Sixth to Seventh Avenues somewhere within the \\"50s\\"-numbered streets, but was forced northward because of complaints about the pungent animal smells. An additional 34 families, mainly Irish, lived in an area bounded by 68th and 72nd Streets between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Nearby, on the current site of Tavern on the Green, were a collection of bone-boiling plants, which employed people from Seneca Village and nearby settlements. To the southwest of Seneca Village was the settlement of Harsenville, which is now part of the Upper West Side between 66th and 81st Streets. There were also two German settlements: one at the modern-day park's northern end and one south of the current Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. Many of the Irish and German residents were also farmers with their own gardens. An additional settlement in the northeast corner of Central Park included a portion of the former Boston Post Road. That corner contains McGowan's Pass, a topological feature that was the site of a Hessian encampment during the American Revolutionary War, and Blockhouse No. 1, a still-extant fortification built during the War of 1812. Mount St. Vincent's Academy was also sited near McGowan's Pass until 1881. Demise = Planning of Central Park = By the 1840s, members of the city's elite were publicly calling for the construction of a new large park in Manhattan. Two of the primary proponents were William Cullen Bryant, the editor of the New York Evening Post, and Andrew Jackson Downing, one of the first American landscape designers. The Special Committee on Parks was formed to survey possible sites for the proposed large park. One of the first sites considered was Jones's Wood, a tract of land between 66th and 75th Streets on the Upper East Side. The area was occupied by multiple wealthy families who objected to the taking of their land, particularly the Jones and Schermerhorn families. Downing stated that he would prefer a park of at least at any location from 39th Street to the Harlem River. Following the passage of an 1851 bill to acquire Jones's Wood, the Schermerhorns and Joneses successfully obtained an injunction to block the acquisition, and the transaction was invalidated as unconstitutional. The second site proposed for a large public park was a area labeled \\"Central Park\\", bounded by 59th and 106th Streets between Fifth and Eighth Avenues. The Central Park plan gradually gained support from a variety of groups. After a second bill to acquire Jones's Wood was nullified, the New York State Legislature passed the Central Park Act in July 1853; the act authorized a board of five commissioners to start purchasing land for a park, and it created a Central Park Fund to raise money. In the years prior to the acquisition of Central Park, the Seneca Village community was referred to in pejorative terms, including racial slurs. Park advocates and the media began to describe Seneca Village and other communities in this area as \\"shantytowns\\" and the residents there as \\"squatters\\" and \\"vagabonds and scoundrels\\"; the Irish and Black residents were often described as \\"wretched\\" and \\"debased\\". The residents of Seneca Village were also accused of stealing food and operating illegal bars. The village's detractors included Egbert Ludovicus Viele, the park's first engineer, who wrote a report about the \\"refuge of five thousand squatters\\" living on the future site of Central Park, criticizing the residents as people with \\"very little knowledge of the English language, and with very little respect for the law\\". While a minority of Seneca Village's residents were landowners, most residents had formal or informal agreements with landlords; only a few residents were squatters with no permission from any landlord. = Razing = In 1853, the Central Park commissioners started conducting property assessments on more than 34,000 lots in and near Central Park. The Central Park commissioners had completed their assessments by July 1855, and the New York State Supreme Court confirmed this work the following February. As part of the tax assessment, residents were offered an average of $700 for their property. The minority of Seneca Village residents who owned land were compensated. For instance, Andrew Williams was paid $2,335 for his house and three lots, and even though he had originally asked for $3,500, the final compensation still represented a significant increase over the $125 that he had paid for the property in 1825. Clearing occurred as soon as the Central Park commission's report was released in October 1855. The city began enforcing little-known regulations and forcing Seneca Village residents to pay rent. Members of the community fought to retain their land. For two years, residents protested and filed lawsuits to halt the sale of their land. However, in mid-1856, Mayor Fernando Wood prevailed, and residents of Seneca Village were given final notices. In 1857, the city government acquired all private property within Seneca Village through eminent domain, and on October 1, city officials in New York reported that the last holdouts living on land that was to become Central Park had been removed. A newspaper account at the time suggested that Seneca Village would \\"not be forgotten... [as] many a brilliant and stirring fight was had during the campaign. But the supremacy of the law was upheld by the policeman's bludgeons.\\" All of the inhabitants of the village were evicted by 1857, and all of the properties within Central Park were razed. The only institution from Seneca Village to survive was All Angels' Church, which relocated a couple of blocks away, albeit with an entirely new congregation. There are few records of where residents went after their eviction, as the community was entirely destroyed. An Australian newspaper in 1920 had described \\"a famous old woman [...] still living at 90 years of age\\" in Hawaii, who was said to have been born in Seneca Village. By 1997, The New York Times reported that no one had been identified as a descendant of a Seneca Village resident. Elsewhere in Central Park, the impact of eviction was less intense. Some residents, such as foundry owner Edward Snowden, simply relocated elsewhere. Squatters and hog farmers were the most affected by Central Park's construction, as they were never compensated for their evictions. Some traces of Seneca Village persisted in later years. As workers were uprooting trees at the corner of 85th Street and Central Park West in 1871, they came upon two coffins, both containing Black people from Seneca Village. A half-century later, a gardener named Gilhooley inadvertently found a graveyard from Seneca Village while turning soil at the same site. The site was named \\"Gilhooley's Burial Plot\\" in honor of his discovery. Rediscovery The settlement was largely forgotten for more than a century after its demolition. Public interest in Seneca Village was invigorated after the publication of Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar's 1992 book The Park and the People: A History of Central Park, which described the community extensively. =Memorials= The Seneca Village Project was formed in 1998 as a collaboration between Cynthia Copeland of the New-York Historical Society, Nan Rothschild of Barnard College, and Diana Wall of City College of New York. It is dedicated to raising awareness about Seneca Village's significance as a free, middle-class Black community in 19th-century New York City. The project facilitates educational programs, which engage school children, teachers, and the general public, and bring Seneca Village into public knowledge. In February 2001, former Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, State Senator David Paterson, Borough President C. Virginia Fields, and New York Historical Society Executive Director Betsy Gotbaum unveiled a plaque commemorating the site where Seneca Village once stood. The plaque is located near the modern- day Mariners Playground, near 85th Street and Central Park West. In 2019, the city announced a request for proposals for a statue honoring the Lyons family, property owners in the village. The statue would be placed at 106th Street in the North Woods section of the park, and has received funding from several private donors including the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Ford Foundation, JPB Foundation, and Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund. =Archaeological excavations= Following a 1997 exhibition on the community at the New-York Historical Society, Wall, Rothschild, Copeland, and Herbert Seignoret decided to see if any archaeological traces of the village remained. They worked with local historians, churches, and community groups to shape the direction of their research project on the site. In June 2000, Wall, Rothschild, Copeland, and other researchers started performing imaging tests to determine if any traces of Seneca Village remained. With student participation, the project conducted exhaustive archival research and preliminary remote sensing. Researchers used soil boring to identify promising areas with undisturbed soil. In 2005, the team used ground-penetrating radar to successfully locate traces of Seneca Village. After extended discussions with the New York City Department of Parks and the Central Park Conservancy, researchers were granted permission for test excavations in the regions of the village thought most likely to contain intact archaeological deposits. Digs took place in 2004, August 2005, and mid-2011. The 2011 excavation uncovered the foundation walls and cellar deposits of the home of William Godfrey Wilson, a sexton for All Angels' Church, and a deposit of items in the backyard of two other Seneca Village residents. Archaeologists filled over 250 bags with artifacts, including the bone handle of a toothbrush and the leather sole of a child's shoe.

Paul Erd≈ës and Ernst G. Straus formulated the conjecture in 1948.See, e.g., . Note however that the earliest published reference to it appears to be . It is one of many conjectures by Erd≈ës. If is a composite number, , then an expansion for could be found from an expansion for or . Therefore, if a counterexample to the Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture exists, the smallest forming a counterexample would have to be a prime number, and it can be further restricted to one of six infinite arithmetic progressions modulo .. Computer searches have verified the truth of the conjecture up to , but proving it for all remains an open problem. The restriction that the three unit fractions be positive is essential to the difficulty of the problem, for if negative values were allowed the problem could always be solved. Formulation More formally, the conjecture states that, for every integer , there exist positive integers , , and such that :\\\\frac4n = \\\\frac1x + \\\\frac1y + \\\\frac1z. For instance, for , there are two solutions: :\\\\frac45=\\\\frac12+\\\\frac14+\\\\frac1{20}=\\\\frac12+\\\\frac15+\\\\frac1{10}. Some researchers additionally require these integers to be distinct from each other, while others allow them to be equal. For , it does not matter whether they are required to be distinct: if there exists a solution with any three integers , , and then there exists a solution with distinct integers., conflict resolution section. For , however, the only solution is , up to permutation of the summands. When , , and are distinct then these unit fractions form an Egyptian fraction representation of the number . Background The search for expansions of rational numbers as sums of unit fractions dates to the mathematics of ancient Egypt, in which Egyptian fraction expansions of this type were used as a notation for recording fractional quantities. The Egyptians produced tables such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus 2/n table of expansions of fractions of the form 2/n, most of which use either two or three terms. Egyptian fractions typically have an additional constraint, that all of the unit fractions be distinct from each other, but for the purposes of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture this makes no difference: if 4/n can be expressed as a sum of three unit fractions, it can also be expressed as a sum of three distinct unit fractions by repeatedly replacing any duplicated fraction by one of the following two expansions, :\\\\frac{1}{2r}+\\\\frac{1}{2r} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{r+1}+\\\\frac{1}{r(r+1)} :\\\\frac{1}{2r+1}+\\\\frac{1}{2r+1} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{r+1}+\\\\frac{1}{(r+1)(2r+1)} (according to whether the repeated fraction has an even or odd denominator) until no duplicate fractions remain.See the conflict resolution section of for a proof that a closely related replacement process (with a different expansion for even denominators that reduces the number of fractions) always terminates with a non-repeating expansion. The greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, first described in 1202 by Fibonacci in his book Liber Abaci, finds an expansion in which each successive term is the largest unit fraction that is no larger than the remaining number to be represented. For fractions of the form 2/n or 3/n, the greedy algorithm uses at most two or three terms respectively. More generally, it can be shown that a number of the form 3/n has a two-term expansion if and only if n has a factor congruent to 2 modulo 3, and requires three terms in any expansion otherwise. Thus, for the numerators 2 and 3, the question of how many terms are needed in an Egyptian fraction is completely settled, and fractions of the form 4/n are the first case in which the worst-case length of an expansion remains unknown. The greedy algorithm produces expansions of length two, three, or four depending on the value of n modulo 4; when n is congruent to 1 modulo 4, the greedy algorithm produces four-term expansions. Therefore, the worst-case length of an Egyptian fraction of 4/n must be either three or four. The Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture states that, in this case, as in the case for the numerator 3, the maximum number of terms in an expansion is three.. Modular identities Multiplying both sides of the equation 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z by nxyz leads to an equivalent form 4xyz = n(xy + xz + yz) for the problem.See e.g. for a simpler Diophantine formulation using more specific assumptions about which of x, y, and z are divisible by n. As a polynomial equation with integer variables, this is an example of a Diophantine equation. The Hasse principle for Diophantine equations asserts that an integer solution of a Diophantine equation should be formed by combining solutions obtained modulo each possible prime number. On the face of it this principle makes little sense for the Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture, as the equation 4xyz = n(xy + xz + yz) is easily solvable modulo any prime. Nevertheless, modular identities have proven a very important tool in the study of the conjecture. For values of n satisfying certain congruence relations, one can find an expansion for 4/n automatically as an instance of a polynomial identity. For instance, whenever n ‚â° 2 (mod 3), 4/n has the expansion :\\\\frac{4}{n} = \\\\frac{1}{n} + \\\\frac{1}{(n+1)/3} + \\\\frac{1}{n(n+1)/3}. Here each of the three denominators n, (n + 1)/3, and n(n + 1)/3 is a polynomial of n, and each is an integer whenever n is 2 (mod 3). The greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions finds a solution in three or fewer terms whenever n is not 1 or 17 (mod 24), and the n ‚â° 17 (mod 24) case is covered by the 2 (mod 3) relation, so the only values of n for which these two methods do not find expansions in three or fewer terms are those congruent to 1 (mod 24). If it were possible to find solutions such as the ones above for enough different moduli, forming a complete covering system of congruences, the problem would be solved. However, as showed, a polynomial identity that provides a solution for values of n congruent to r mod p can exist only when r is not a quadratic residue modulo p. For instance, 2 is a not a quadratic residue modulo 3, so the existence of an identity for values of n that are congruent to 2 modulo 3 does not contradict Mordell's result, but 1 is a quadratic residue modulo 3 so the result proves that there can be no similar identity for all values of n that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. As 1 is a quadratic residue modulo n (n > 1), there can be no complete covering system of modular identities for all n. Polynomial identities listed by Mordell provide three-term Egyptian fractions for 4/n whenever n is 2 mod 3 (above), 3 mod 4, 2 or 3 mod 5, 3, 5, or 6 mod 7, or 5 mod 8 (2, 3, 6 and 7 mod 8 are already covered by earlier identities). These identities cover all the numbers that are not quadratic residues for those bases. However, for larger bases, not all nonresidues are known to be covered by relations of this type. From Mordell's identities one can conclude that there exists a solution for all n except possibly those that are 1, 121, 169, 289, 361, or 529 modulo 840. 1009 is the smallest prime number that is not covered by this system of congruences. By combining larger classes of modular identities, Webb and others showed that the fraction of n in the interval [1,N] that can be counterexamples to the conjecture tends to zero in the limit as N goes to infinity. Despite Mordell's result limiting the form these congruence identities can take, there is still some hope of using modular identities to prove the Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture. No prime number can be a square, so by the Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem, whenever p is prime, there exists a larger prime q such that p is not a quadratic residue modulo q. One possible approach to proving the conjecture would be to find for each prime p a larger prime q and a congruence solving the 4/n problem for n ‚â° p (mod q); if this could be done, no prime p could be a counterexample to the conjecture and the conjecture would be true. Computational verification Various authors have performed brute-force searches for counterexamples to the conjecture; these searches can be greatly sped up by considering only prime numbers that are not covered by known congruence relations.; ; ; ; ; ; ; . Searches of this type have confirmed that the conjecture is true for all n up to 1017. The number of solutions The number of distinct solutions to the 4/n problem, as a function of n, has also been found by computer searches for small n and appears to grow somewhat irregularly with n. Starting with n = 3, the numbers of distinct solutions with distinct denominators are :1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 7, 15, 4, 14, 33, 22, 4, 21, 9, ... . Even for larger n there can be relatively few solutions; for instance there are only seven distinct solutions for n = 73. have shown that the average number of solutions to the 4/n problem (averaged over the prime numbers up to n) is upper bounded polylogarithmically in n. For some other Diophantine problems, it is possible to prove that a solution always exists by proving asymptotic lower bounds on the number of solutions, but proofs of this type exist primarily for problems in which the number of solutions grows polynomially, so Elsholtz and Tao's result makes a proof of this type less likely.On the number of solutions to , Terence Tao, \\"What's new\\", July 7, 2011. The proof of Elsholtz and Tao's bound on the number of solutions involves the Bombieri‚ÄìVinogradov theorem, the Brun‚ÄìTitchmarsh theorem, and a system of modular identities, valid when n is congruent to ‚àíc or ‚àí1/c modulo 4ab, where a and b are any two coprime positive integers and c is any odd factor of a + b. For instance, setting a = b = 1 gives one of Mordell's identities, valid when n is 3 (mod 4). Negative-number solutions The restriction that x, y, and z be positive is essential to the difficulty of the problem, for if negative values were allowed the problem could be solved trivially via one of the two identities :\\\\frac{4}{4k+1} = \\\\frac{1}{k} - \\\\frac{1}{k(4k+1)}=\\\\frac{1}{2k}+\\\\frac{1}{2k}-\\\\frac{1}{k(4k+1)} and :\\\\frac{4}{4k-1} = \\\\frac{1}{k} + \\\\frac{1}{k(4k-1)}=\\\\frac{1}{2k}+\\\\frac{1}{2k}+\\\\frac{1}{k(4k-1)}. Alternatively, for any odd n, a three-term solution with one negative term is possible:. :\\\\frac{4}{n}=\\\\frac{1}{(n-1)/2}+\\\\frac{1}{(n+1)/2}-\\\\frac{1}{n(n-1)(n+1)/4}. Generalizations A generalized version of the conjecture states that, for any positive k there exists a number N such that, for all n ‚â• N, there exists a solution in positive integers to k/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z. The version of this conjecture for k = 5 was made by Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski, and the full conjecture is due to Andrzej Schinzel.; . Even if the generalized conjecture is false for any fixed value of k, then the number of fractions k/n with n in the range from 1 to N that do not have three-term expansions must grow only sublinearly as a function of N.; ; ; ; ; . In particular, if the Erd≈ës‚ÄìStraus conjecture itself (the case k = 4) is false, then the number of counterexamples grows only sublinearly. Even more strongly, for any fixed k, only a sublinear number of values of n need more than two terms in their Egyptian fraction expansions.. The generalized version of the conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the number of unexpandable fractions is not just sublinear but bounded. When n is an odd number, by analogy to the problem of odd greedy expansions for Egyptian fractions, one may ask for solutions to k/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z in which x, y, and z are distinct positive odd numbers.

Plot A married couple plays a game of Scrabble that has stalemated as the husband is unable to come up with a word. The two go their separate ways; he watches his favourite TV show, \\"Sawing for Teens,\\" while his wife works on cleaning the house. While the husband dozes off, \\"Sawing for Teens\\" is interrupted by the emergency warning: a severe worldwide nuclear war has broken out, and the cat severs the TV's electrical cord. As the husband awakens, he looks out the window to see that the streets have descended into chaos, and he returns to the game board, unaware of the global cataclysm, and sneaking a peek at his wife's letters. The wife, finished with her cleaning and also oblivious, catches him in the act, which he denies. And then, the two begin arguing over every petty flaw each one has, up to the point where the wife runs away in tears. The husband spots an old photo of him and his wife at \\"Expo 1957\\" (a spoof of the real-life Expo 67), prompting memories of the couple in happier times. Unable to console his wife, he begins playing the concertina (poorly), which softens his wife enough for both of them to reconcile. As the cat claws to be let outside, the husband obliges and reaches for the doorknob. At that moment, following a cutaway of a rapidly zooming-in bird's-eye view of their house, a white glow emanates from the keyhole and the husband is vapourized, implying that a nuclear bomb has hit the house and that everyone has been instantly killed.Internet Archive The door then opens and, instead of chaos, a vision of Heaven is seen outside. The couple, unaware of their apparent death, marvels at the beauty of the scene and decides to return to their Scrabble game.

History Kazan Helicopters in Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia has been one of the main Russian manufacturers of helicopters of the Mikhail Mil bureau design. In the 1990s management realized that there would be a need for light helicopters in Russia, as the fleet of standard Mi-2's was getting older, and the design itself became obsolete. The Mi-2 was the lightest helicopter in large-scale use in the former USSR, despite being larger than most light Western helicopters. At first Kazan Helicopters wanted to develop a helicopter based on the AS 350 Ecureuil in cooperation with Eurocopter, but it failed. As a result, in 1993 Kazan Helicopters organized its own design bureau in order to create a new helicopter (the bureau was officially certified by the Russian authorities in January 1997, designer Valery Dvoeglazov). The helicopter was named Ansat (meaning \\"light\\", \\"simple\\" or \\"easy\\" in the Tatar language).Mladenov 2016, pp. 79‚Äì80. In 1998 the first prototype for ground static tests was completed. The second prototype (no. 02, then 902) first flew on August 17, 1999, but the first official flight was made on October 6, 1999. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206 engines. Another prototype, with a longer and slimmer fuselage, and powered by two PW207K engines, flew on December 27, 2001 (no. 03, then 904). From 2002 it was undergoing the certification process. The third prototype introduced clam shell doors for the cabin opening upwards and downwards, instead of the sliding ones. It was offered as the Ansat-U military trainer variant with dual controls. , apart from the fourth prototype, no further Ansat's had yet been built. In September 2001, the Ansat-U won a contest for a trainer helicopter for the Russian Air Force. By 2010 four were in service with the Russian Air Force's Syzran Military Pilot Flying Training School. A further 20 are planned, to be powered by Ukrainian Motor Sich MS-500V engines replacing the Pratt & Whitney engines of the first four Ansats.Mladenov 2010, p. 26. New light multi-purpose civilian helicopter \\"ANSAT\\" with hydromechanical control system of JSC \\"Kazan Helicopter Plant\\" has received type certification of Aviation Register of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) on 28 August 2013. Type Certificate of IAC AR, allowing (freight) helicopters to begin commercial operation, was obtained in August 2013. In December 2014, IAC AR issued the approval of the main changes (addition to the type certificate), allowing for the transportation of the passengers on the commercial market. The emergence of medical options was the final step in creating a unified helicopter, certified for transport and medical works, transportation of people. Earlier, versions of these helicopters were used by the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Internal Affairs, FSB and other state structures of Russia. Ansat-U cockpit VIP version of Ansat helicopter was certified on 31 December 2015 and with a cabin in the style of the Aurus luxury cars brand in early February 2020.https://www.airrecognition.com/index.php/news/defense-aviation- news/2020/february/5984-rostec-is-ready-to-start-deliveries-of-the-ansat- aurus-helicopter.html The helicopter is equipped with hydromechanical control system and its passenger cabin can accommodate up to seven energy-absorbing passenger seats. There is also a ventilation and air conditioning systems. According to General Director at Kazan Helicopter Plant Vadim Ligai, work is underway to modernize helicopter's fuel system and install additional 200 kg fuel tanks in order to increase its flight range. On 28 October 2016, Russian Helicopters has presented a civilian version of Ansat helicopter. In 2017‚Äì2018, the helicopter has been certified for operation under extremely cold and high temperatures from minus 45¬∞–° to plus 50¬∞–°, during series of ground and flight testing. In January 2019, on the basis of trials conducted at the Mount Elbrus in 2018, the Federal Air Transport Agency certified the increase in take-off/landing altitude of the Ansat from previous 1,000 m to 3,500 m and approved the helicopter for high-altitude operations.

The weekday program airs on CTV at 7 p.m. ET/PT and CTV 2 at 7:30 p.m. ET/PT, and also back-to-back on other Bell Media television stations. History The series began as Entertainment Now (or eNow), originally hosted by Lin Eleoff, who was replaced by Carla Collins, who later co-anchored with Dan Duran, and began airing weekly on BBS (later absorbed into CTV) in 1995. Much as now, in its original form eNow used a toned-down version of the standard entertainment magazine format. in 2000, eNow relaunched as etalk, a weekly entertainment-oriented talk show hosted by Ben Mulroney with a variety of rotating guest panelists. It was produced by the CTV-owned talktv (now MTV) and taped on the set of The Chatroom, of which Mulroney was a co-host. Following cancellation of The Chatroom in 2002, etalk, along with co-host Thea Andrews, returned to its original format. etalk became a daily series on the CTV daytime schedule in fall 2002, accompanied by a temporary name change to etalk Daily; as such, CTV generally regards 2002 as the start date for the current series. It was switched to primetime airings on June 9, 2003, coinciding with the launch of Canadian Idol. Thea Andrews left the show in 2003 and later emerged as a reporter for Entertainment Tonight in 2007. Entertainment journalist David Giammarco was asked to join the show in early 2003 as senior entertainment reporter, bringing numerous celebrity interviews and exclusives. etalk was also added to the schedule of Star! in October 2007 after CTVglobemedia acquired control of CHUM Limited and cancelled Star!'s former entertainment newscast Star! Daily. Since March 2008, etalk has been produced from 299 Queen Street West. The show shared production space with Citytv's Breakfast Television and CityLine until September 8, when Citytv's moved to its new headquarters at 33 Dundas Street East. The street front studio was re- configured for etalk, and later for The Marilyn Denis Show. On June 22, 2020, Ben Mulroney announced his resignation as host of etalk as a result of the George Floyd protests; in a statement, Mulroney announced that \\"more than ever, we need more Black voices, more Indigenous voices, more people of colour in the media as well as every other profession ‚Äì and that is why I have decided to immediately step away from my role at etalk to create space for a new perspective and a new voice.\\" His resignation came in the wake of a controversy in which his wife was accused of bullying and threatening Sasha Exeter, a Black influencer. On September 14, 2020, CTV announced Tyrone Edwards as the new co-anchor of etalk.

In a wider sense, glossitis can mean inflammation of the tongue generally. Glossitis is often caused by nutritional deficiencies and may be painless or cause discomfort. Glossitis usually responds well to treatment if the cause is identified and corrected. Tongue soreness caused by glossitis is differentiated from burning mouth syndrome, where there is no identifiable change in the appearance of the tongue, and there are no identifiable causes.  Symptoms  Patchy depapillation of filiform papillae with prominence of the fungiform papillae. Depending upon what exact meaning of the word glossitis is implied, signs and symptoms might include: * Smooth, shiny appearance of the tongue, caused by loss of lingual papillae. * Tongue color changes, usually to a darker red color than the normal white-pink color of a healthy tongue. * Tongue swelling. * Difficulty with chewing, swallowing, or speaking (either because of tongue soreness or tongue swelling). * Burning sensation. Some use the term secondary burning mouth syndrome in cases where a detectable cause, such as glossitis, for an oral burning sensation. Depending upon the underlying cause, there may be additional signs and symptoms such as pallor, oral ulceration and angular cheilitis.  Causes  =Anemias= Iron-deficiency anemia is mainly caused by blood loss, such as may occur during menses or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. This often results in a depapilled, atrophic glossitis, giving the tongue a bald and shiny appearance, along with pallor (paleness) of the lips and other mucous membranes a tendency towards recurrent oral ulceration, and cheilosis (swelling of the lips). The appearance of the tongue in iron deficiency anemia has been described as diffuse or patchy atrophy with tenderness or burning. One cause of iron deficiency anemia is sideropenic dysphagia (Plummer‚ÄìVinson or Paterson‚ÄìBrown‚ÄìKelly syndrome) which is also characterized by esophageal webbing and dysphagia. Pernicious anemia is usually caused by autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells. Parietal cells secrete intrinsic factor which is required for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia and may present as glossitis. The appearance of the tongue in vitamin B12 deficiency is described as \\"beefy\\" or \\"fiery red and sore\\". There may be linear or patchy red lesions. =Vitamin B deficiencies= Vitamin B1 deficiency (thiamin deficiency) can cause glossitis. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with angular cheilitis, cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and other signs and symptoms. The glossitis in vitamin B2 deficiency is described as magenta. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) can cause glossitis. Vitamin B6 deficiency (pyridoxine deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with angular cheilitis, cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and seborrheic dermatitis. Folate deficiency (vitamin B9 deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue and possibly neurological signs. Apart from pernicious anemia discussed above, any other cause of vitamin B12 deficiency can cause glossitis, which tends to be painful, smooth and shiny. =Infections= Bacterial, viral or fungal infections can cause glossitis. Chronic Candida infections of the tongue can cause an atrophic glossitis known as median rhomboid glossitis. Syphilis is now relatively rare, but the tertiary stage can cause diffuse glossitis and atrophy of lingual papillae, termed \\"syphilitic glossitis\\", \\"luetic glossitis\\" or \\"atrophic glossitis of tertiary syphilis\\". It is caused by Treponema pallidum and is a sexually transmitted infection. =Other causes= Many conditions can cause glossitis via malnutrition or malabsorption, which creates the nutritional deficiencies described above, although other mechanisms may be involved in some of those conditions listed. * Alcoholism * Sprue (celiac disease, or tropical sprue), secondary to nutritional deficiencies * Crohn‚Äôs disease * Whipple disease * Glucagonoma syndrome * Cowden disease * Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) * Carcinoid syndrome * Kwashiorkor amyloidosis * Veganism and other specialized diets, *Poor hydration and low saliva in the mouth, which allows bacteria to grow more readily *Mechanical irritation or injury from burns, rough edges of teeth or dental appliances, or other trauma *Tongue piercing Glossitis can be caused by the constant irritation by the ornament and by colonization of Candida albicans in site and on the ornament *Exposure to irritants such as tobacco, alcohol, hot foods, or spices *Allergic reaction to toothpaste, mouthwash, breath fresheners, dyes in confectionery, plastic in dentures or retainers, or certain blood-pressure medications (ACE inhibitors) *Administration of ganglion blockers (e.g., Tubocurarine, Mecamylamine). *Oral lichen planus, erythema multiforme, aphthous ulcer, pemphigus vulgaris *Heredity *Albuterol (bronchodilator medicine) A painful tongue may be an indication of an underlying serious medical condition and nearly always merits assessment by a physician or dental surgeon. Diagnosis =Classification= Median rhomboid glossitis Geographic tongue (benign migratory glossitis) Glossitis could be classified as a group of tongue diseases or gastrointestinal diseases. It may be primary, where there is no underlying cause, or secondary where it is a sign or symptom of another condition. It can be acute or chronic. Generally speaking, there are several clinical patterns of glossitis, some more common than others. Atrophic glossitis Atrophic glossitis, also known as bald tongue, smooth tongue, Hunter glossitis, Moeller glossitis, or M√∂ller-Hunter glossitis, is a condition characterized by a smooth glossy tongue that is often tender/painful, caused by complete atrophy of the lingual papillae (depapillation). The dorsal tongue surface may be affected totally, or in patches, and may be associated with a burning sensation, pain and/or erythema. Atrophic glossitis is a non-specific finding, and has a great many causes, usually related to iron-deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, B vitamin complex deficiencies, unrecognized and untreated celiac disease (which often presents without gastrointestinal symptoms), or other factors such as xerostomia (dry mouth). Although the terms M√∂ller and Hunter glossitis were originally used to refer to specifically the glossitis that occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to pernicious anemia, they are now used as synonyms for atrophic glossitis generally. In this article, the term glossitis, unless otherwise specified, refers to atrophic glossitis. Candidiasis may be a concurrent finding or an alternative cause of erythema, burning, and atrophy. Median rhomboid glossitis This condition is characterized by a persistent erythematous, rhomboidal depapillated lesion in the central area of the dorsum of the tongue, just in front of the circumvallate papillae. Median rhomboid glossitis is a type of oral candidiasis, and rarely causes any symptoms. It is treated with antifungal medication. Predisposing factors include use of corticosteroid sprays or inhalers or immunosuppression. Benign migratory glossitis Geographic tongue, also termed benign migratory glossitis, is a common condition which usually affects the dorsal surface of the tongue. It is characterized by patches of depapillation and erythema bordered by a whitish peripheral zone. These patches give the tongue the appearance of a map, hence the name. Unlike glossitis due to nutritional deficiencies and anemia, the lesions of geographic tongue move around the tongue over time. This is because in geographic tongue, new areas of the tongue become involved with the condition whilst previously affected areas heal, giving the appearance of a moving lesion. The cause is unknown, and there is no curative treatment. Rarely are there any symptoms associated with the lesions, but occasionally a burning sensation may be present, which is exacerbated by eating hot, spicy or acidic foodstuffs. Some consider geographic tongue to be an early stage of fissured tongue, since the two conditions often occur in combination. Geometric glossitis Geometric glossitis, also termed herpetic geometric glossitis, is a term used by some to refer to a chronic lesion associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I infection, in which there is a deep fissure in the midline of the tongue, which gives off multiple branches. The lesion is usually very painful, and there may be erosions present in the depths of the fissures. Similar fissured lesions which are not associated with HSV, as may occur in fissured tongue, do not tend to be painful. The name comes from the geometric pattern of the fissures which are longitudinal, crossed or branched. It is described as occurring in immunocompromized persons, e.g. who have leukemia. However, the association between herpes simplex and geometric glossitis is disputed by some due to a lack of gold standard techniques for diagnosis of intraoral herpetic lesions, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompromized individuals. Treatment is with systemic aciclovir. Strawberry tongue Distinct strawberry tongue with \\"parched\\" lips as seen in a young child with Kawasaki disease. Strawberry tongue, or raspberry tongue, is glossitis which manifests with hyperplastic (enlarged) fungiform papillae, giving the appearance of a strawberry. White strawberry tongue is where there is a white coating on the tongue through which the hyperplastic fungiform papillae protrude. Red strawberry tongue is where the white coating is lost and a dark red, erythematous surface is revealed, interspaced with the hyperplastic fungiform papillae. White strawberry tongue is seen in early scarlet fever (a systemic infection of group A Œ≤- hemolytic streptococci), and red strawberry tongue occurs later, after 4‚Äì5 days. Strawberry tongue is also seen in Kawasaki disease (a vasculitic disorder primarily occurring in children under 5), and toxic shock syndrome. It may mimic other types of glossitis or Vitamin B12 deficiency.  Treatment  The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation. Treatment usually does not require hospitalization unless tongue swelling is severe. Good oral hygiene is necessary, including thorough tooth brushing at least twice a day, and flossing at least daily. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may be given to reduce the inflammation of glossitis. For mild cases, topical applications (such as a prednisone mouth rinse that is not swallowed) may be recommended to avoid the side effects of swallowed or injected corticosteroids. Antibiotics, antifungal medications, or other antimicrobials may be prescribed if the cause of glossitis is an infection. Anemia and nutritional deficiencies (such as a deficiency in niacin, riboflavin, iron, or Vitamin E) must be treated, often by dietary changes or other supplements. Avoid irritants (such as hot or spicy foods, alcohol, and tobacco) to minimize the discomfort. In some cases, tongue swelling may threaten the airway, a medical emergency that needs immediate attention. Epidemiology One review reported overall prevalence ranges of 0.1‚Äì14.3% for geographic tongue, 1.3‚Äì9.0% for \\"atrophy tongue\\" (atrophic glossitis), and 0.0‚Äì3.35% for median rhomboid glossitis.

A: enamel organ B: dental papilla C: dental follicle The dental follicle, also known as dental sac, is made up of mesenchymal cells and fibres surrounding the enamel organ and dental papilla of a developing tooth. It is a vascular fibrous sac containing the developing tooth and its odontogenic organ. The dental follicle (DF) differentiates into the periodontal ligament. In addition, it may be the precursor of other cells of the periodontium, including osteoblasts, cementoblasts and fibroblasts. They develop into the alveolar bone, the cementum with Sharpey's fibers and the periodontal ligament fibers respectively. Similar to dental papilla, the dental follicle provides nutrition to the enamel organ and dental papilla and also have an extremely rich blood supply.  Role in tooth eruption  The formative role of the dental follicle starts when the crown of the tooth is fully developed and just before tooth eruption into the oral cavity. Although tooth eruption mechanisms have yet to be understood entirely, generally it can be agreed that many factors, together, affect the tooth eruption process which is why it is very difficult to differentiate the causes and effects. There have been many theories proposed for tooth eruption. Ideas such as remodelling of the alveolar bone, root elongation and to a certain extent, the most probable reasoning for tooth eruption in human beings is the formation of the periodontal ligament. = Bone Remodelling = Bone remodelling of the jaws has been associated to tooth eruption such that in the pre-eruptive phase of a tooth, the natural pattern of growth of the maxilla or mandible would theoretically move teeth by the selective deposition and reabsorption of bone in the adjacent surroundings of the tooth. A sequence of experiments in dogs does provide the most reliable substantiation to prove that bone remodelling is a cause of tooth movement. When an eruption is stopped by wiring the tooth germ on to the lower margin of the mandible or when the dental follicle remains undisturbed as the developing pre-molar is removed, osteoclasts enlarge the gubernacular canal while an eruptive pathway develops within the bone covering over the enucleated tooth. However, no eruptive pathway will develop if the dental follicle is removed. Furthermore, the replica will erupt with the development of an eruptive pathway as long as the dental follicle is preserved when an exact silicone or metal duplicate replaces the tooth germ. Such observations should be examined judiciously and in great detail. Firstly, eruptive pathways have unmistakably been demonstrated to develop in bone deprived of a budding or growing tooth. Secondly, they provided evidence to prove that the dental follicle is involved in the process. Therefore, it is only when concurrent bone deposition can be confirmed at the base of the crypt and inhibition of such bone deposition can be demonstrated to show interference with tooth eruption, then the conclusion that an eruptive pathway forming within bone means that bony remodelling is the cause for tooth formation. In many studies, with the usage of tetracyclines as indicators of bone deposition have proven that bone resorption is principal activity in the fundus of an alveolus in a number of species, including human beings. For example, in human beings, the base of the crypt of the permanent first molars and permanent third molars will repeatedly reabsorb as the eruption of these teeth occur, although, in the second molars and second premolars, there will be some bone deposition on the crypt floor. For the circumstance of a dormant duplicate‚Äôs demonstrated eruption, many would think that the bony remodelling would be the only reason. However, as per what will be discussed next, it can be concluded that follicular tissue is accountable for this movement as supported by pieces of evidence. Furthermore, in some recent research, it has been observed that alveolar bone growth at the base of the crypt is a prerequisite for molar tooth eruption in rats. Undoubtedly, more attention needs to be given to the intraosseous tooth eruption. Regardless of whether bone growth is a main moving force, it can widely be agreed that for tooth eruption to happen, the dental follicle is required and that, as will be discussed later, the dental follicle regulates bone remodelling. = Dental follicle = Researches show a repeated series of cellular activities which involves the reduced dental epithelium and the follicle linked to tooth eruption that assists bone absorption and connective tissue degradation. With the lack of colony-stimulating factor 1, a factor that encourages differentiation of osteoclasts, in osteopetrotic animals, no mechanism for bone removal is present and therefore eruption is prevented. The eruption will happen when differentiation of osteoclasts is allowed due to local administration of the colony-stimulating factor 1. Proteases, which is produced by the reduced enamel epithelium, results in a path of least resistance as it promotes the breakdown of connective tissue. When stimulating alveolar bone growth at the base of the crypt, expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-6 in the dental follicle may also be necessary. It is also thought that signalling between the dental follicle and the reduced enamel epithelium exists. This signalling could be a plausible reason for the noteworthy regularity of eruption timings because the enamel epithelium is most possibly programmed as part of its functional life cycle. Signalling would also aid in explaining why radicular follicle, that is not related to reduced enamel epithelium, is involved in the formation of the periodontal ligament but does not experience degeneration. = Periodontal ligament = Cells of dental follicle will differentiate into collagen forming fibroblast of cementoblasts and periodontal ligaments, that produces and secretes cementum on the surface of the tooth roots. As the tooth roots break apart, some cells of the dental follicle will invade the roots of the tooth. Delicate fibres that appear along the developing roots near the cervical region of the crown will also be formed by some cells of the ligament. These are most likely the stem cell fibroblasts that form principle fibre groups that will surface as the roots lengthen. As fibres become implanted in the cementum of the root surface, the other end will be attached to the forming alveolar bone. Rejuvenation and development of the periodontal ligament have been taken as a factor in the eruption of the tooth due to the traction power possessed by fibroblasts and because of experimental results relying on the unceasingly erupting rat incisor. The case is not the same where the existence of a periodontal ligament does not always correspond with resorption in teeth that have limited growth period. Cases do however happen in which rootless teeth erupt and when a periodontal ligament is present, and the tooth does not erupt. One significant difference in the formation of fibres exists between teeth that have predecessors and teeth that do not have predecessors. For the former group of teeth (such as the permanent incisors, the canines and the premolars), the principal fibres group will develop later than in the latter group of teeth (such as the deciduous teeth and the permanent molars). It can be observed that the coronal half of the periodontal ligament is made up of well composed, obliquely orientated principal collagen fibre bundles when an erupting permanent molar enters into the oral cavity. The opposite is true too. A majority of the periodontal ligament of an erupting permanent premolar is deprived of a discernable number of organized principal collagen fibre bundles passing from tooth to alveolar bone. = Molecular Determinants of tooth eruption = Tooth eruption is a closely controlled process which involves the tooth organ, consisting of the dental follicle and the enamel organ, and adjacent alveolar tissues. The balance between tissue formation of bone, periodontal ligament and root, and tissue destruction of bone, connective tissue and epithelium causes tooth movement. Osteoclasts are gathered from circulating monocytes which are chemically drawn to the location where bone resorption takes place during bone remodelling. A growth factor, colony-stimulating factor 1, produced by the dental follicle, encourages the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and osteoclasts. In addition, as a result of the epidermal growth factor, the enamel organ produces interleukin-1 alpha, a promoter of bone resorption, that induces follicular cells to produce the colony-stimulating factor 1. In the process of tooth eruption, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 may also be involved. Signalling via the receptor-activated Nuclear factor kB or receptor- activated Nuclear factor kB ligand or osteoprotegerin pathway controls osteoclastogenesis. In the apex of the dental follicle, osteoprotegerin prevents osteoclast formation, and its expression is down-regulated. Ultimately, accentuation of the differentiation of osteoblasts at the base of the alveolar crypt is accentuated. A high level of transcription factor Runt-related transcription factor- 2, that is involved in osteoblast differentiation and function, is indicated in the basal portion of the dental follicle. Down-regulation of the expression of the Runt-related transcription factor- 2 in the apex portion of the dental follicle, that supports bone removal along the surface which the tooth erupts, is due to the transforming growth factor b. Acceleration of incisor eruption in rodents has been proven to be affected by the epidermal growth factor which increases the level of expression for the transformation of growth factor b.  Role in development of Odontogenic Cysts and Tumours  = Role in development of odontogenic cysts and tumour = The most common pathologies associated with dental follicle are dentigerous cyst, keratocystic odontogenic tumor and ameloblastoma. Carcinomas, such as primary intraosseous carcinoma and the other tumors including sarcoma and bromixoma can also be associated with dental follicle. Dentigerous (follicular) cyst The second most common odentogenic cyst is the follicular cyst. The cyst develops in normal dental follicule surrounding an unerupted tooth. It can also develop from break down of stellate reticulum or collection of fluid between the reduced enamel epithelium layers. Clinical features The dentigerous cyst is often found in areas where unerupted teeth are found. These areas, in decreasing order of frequency, are mandibular third molars, maxillary third molars and maxillary canines. The cyst may grow to a large size, replace the tooth with which they are associated, or hardly cause resorption of adjacent tooth roots. Diagnosis Clinical and radiographic assessments are required to diagnose dentigerous cysts. A cyst is present when the follicular space exceeds 5mm from the crown. However, it is possible that keratocysts and ameloblastomas mimic the radiographical appearance of follicular cysts. Aspiration can be used to differentiate the lesions. Treatment \\\\- Marsupialization This procedure is partial removal of associated tooth. The advantage of this procedure is that it maintains the vitality of teeth and is less invasive. The disadvantage is that it required substantial after care and heals very slowly. \\\\- Enucleation This procedure is complete removal of the associated tooth. The advantage of enucleation is that the cyst cavity heals eventually and the full cyst tissue is available for histological examination. The disadvantage is that if the cyst involves the apices of adjacent vital teeth, the surgery might deprive the teeth of their blood supply and kill the viral teeth. = Odontogenic Tumors = Odontogenic tumors may consist of odontogenic epithelium, odontogenic connective tissue or both. Odontogenic tumours consisting predominantly of epithelium arise from odontogenic epithelium. Odontogenic tumours composed of odontogenic connective tissue arise from the ectomesenchymal region of the tooth germ, either from the dental papilla or the dental follicle. Odontogenic tumours of mixed origin contain both ameloblastic epithelium and odontoblastic tissue while in active growth. After complete development, it principally consists of enamel, dentine and cementum.  Dental Follicle Stem Cells  The presence of stem cells in the dental is an integral part of the DF‚Äôs ability to differentiate into the periodontal ligament. Current knowledge about the stem cells present in DFs, is based on the extraction of DFs from immature roots of impacted teeth. In Comparison to the DF of a typically erupted tooth, the DF of an impacted tooth, e.g. third molar, does not surround the tooth and subsequently be divided into two parts. The periapical section: This surrounds the apex of the developing tooth root and mediates tooth eruption. The coronal section: This is attached to developing tooth root and mediates bone growth. Stem cells isolated from these two parts are summarised below. = Multipotentectomesenchymal Precursor Cells = Multipotentectomesenchymal precursor cells also referred to as DFCs are found in the coronal part of the DF of impacted human third molar teeth contains. DFCs are considered multipotent, and they are especially precursors for cells of the tooth attachment apparatus Cells of this tissue structure express typical markers for PDL fibroblast, alveolar osteoblasts, and cementoblasts. When cultivated, DFCs have a morphology that is comparable to that of a fibroblast and express markers such as Nestin and STRO-1 which are typical markers for dental stem cells. These cells have are highly proliferate and proliferate typically at a higher rate than that of a proliferating bone marrow- derived Mesenchymal stem cell.  Regulation of DFCs  The initiation of differentiation is controlled by a number of different extracellular factors, such as growth factors, cell-cell contacts, extracellular matrix, and mechanical loading. These factors coordinate to induce or modulate the process of differentiation into particular functional body cell type. There have been some studies done recently about the differentiation of cultivated DFCs into biomineralising cells. These studies revealed new ways in which the cell differentiation mechanisms work. Moreover, information about genome-wide expression profiles was provided by proteomics and transcriptomics with DFCs. These help in showing more clearly the molecular mechanisms in cells. The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was also revealed during the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs by these investigations. The proteomics and transcriptomics identified regulated transcription factors such as SP1 and TP53. These transcription factors were more precisely identified by bioinformatics after the analysis of the proteome. The role of these transcription factors regulate the cell proliferation and differentiation of DFCs. Human dental follicle cells are progenitor cells. Different studies suggested that osteogenic differentiation of DFCs is controlled by BMP2 and IGF2, which are growth factors. However, the influence of BMP2 and IGF2 on the differentiation of DFCs has not been analysed in too much depth. There was a study that examined DFCs after the induction of osteogenic differentiation with BMP2, IGF2 and a standard osteogenic differentiation medium (ODM) with dexamethasone. The alkaline phosphatase activity and the calcium accumulation showed osteogenic differentiation after all treatments, but with the most effective differentiation by ODM. Furthermore, markers of the process of osteoblast differentiation were much higher up-regulated in BMP2- or IGF2-treated cells than in ODM-treated cells. To find the reason between these differences, the genome-wide expression profiles were compared at an early differentiation stage. Chondroblast markers in BMP2-differentiated cells and general markers for cell differentiation/proliferation in IGF2-treated cells were significantly regulated. However, ODM-treated DFCs expressed late markers of osteogenic-differentiated DFCs such as the transcription factor ZBTB16 that is not expressed in BMP2- or IGF2-differentiated cells. Therefore, this study shows that osteogenic differentiation of DFCs can be triggered with all tested inducers. However to analyse this mechanism, the transcription factor ZBTB16 is a target for further investigations. DLX3, a transcription factor, which is related to the induced BMP2 pathway in osteogenic differentiated DFCs was able to trigger cell viability and the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs via the BMP2/Smad1 feedback loop ). DFCs control the proportional amount of all three periodontal tissues, which includes a good balance between the size of the periodontal ligament and the amount of the surrounding cementum and alveolar bone. A high level of periodontal ligament in the periodontium supports the growth of the cementum and the alveolar bone. This is why a soft extracellular matrix supports the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs.  The Migration Capacity of DFCs The migration capacity of DFCs can be histological examined, during this, DFCs demonstrate an extensive migratory capacity for dental mesenchymal stem cells, during the initial stages of tooth root development. When compared with the migration capacity of stem cells from the dental pulp of baby teeth and stem cells from the dental apical papilla (dental neural crest derived progenitor cells, dNC-PCs), DFCs are found to have the highest cell migration velocity. Furthermore, DFC migration can be accelerated during cultivation, with the use of growth factors found in the dental hard tissue matrix such as TGF-Œ≤ or BMP2 which have also been found to be involved in the differentiation of DFCs  Follicle-Derived Embryonic Neural Crest Stem Cells (FENCSCs) FENCSCs are a sub-population of DFCs, however both differ in their in cell migration properties. FENSCs express high levels of embryonic stem cell markers (TRA1-60, TRA1-81, OCT-4) and mRNA transcripts for Nanog and Rex-1. They have the ability to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. Some examples include, smooth and skeletal muscle, osteoblasts, neurons, glial cells, and adipocytes and therefore display pluripotency. These cells also have high levels of telomerase activity A strategy that enables isolation of specific types of stem cells within the dental follicle such as FENCSCs, is known as Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting. Cell culturing is also important to consider understanding cellular morphology. DFCs and FENCSCs spheroid cell clusters under serum ‚Äì free cell culture conditions. The choice of adequate cell culture conditions is of great importance for a specific feature of dental stem cells. For example, both DFCs and FENCSCs form spheroid-like cell clusters under serum-free cell culture conditions. = Periapical Follicle Stem Cells (PAFSCs)= Once the development of the tooth root is completed, the DF disappears thus meaning that all cells are considered to be part of the periodontium. Prior to this stage, a periapical part of the DF attaches to the apex of the developing tooth root and is referred to as periapical follicle. Therefore, undifferentiated cells within this tissue are known as Periapical Dental Follicle Stem cells (PAFSCs) and can be isolated from colony forming cells within periapical follicle cell cultures. Typical markers expressed within these cells include, CD44 and STRO1. Both Cell migration capacity and cell proliferation capacity of these cells are greater than various types of dental mesenchymal stem cells. PFACs are targets of regenerative dentistry due to their high multipotent differentiation potential within all types of dental tissue. Despite the closely related developmental origin of PAFScs and DFScs, There is still much to learn about PAFSCs and how they compare to DFSc.  Role in regenerative dentistry  Human dental follicles can be separated from impacted wisdom teeth with undeveloped tooth roots. Therefore, undifferentiated ectomesenchymal cells can be isolated from both apical and coronal parts of the human dental follicle. The dental follicle contains various types of multipotent stem cells. They are progenitors for all types of periodontal cells providing a potential cell source for periodontal regeneration.

For each graph the red/blue nodes shows a sample triplet of mutual friends/strangers. The theorem on friends and strangers is a mathematical theorem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. Statement Suppose a party has six people. Consider any two of them. They might be meeting for the first time‚Äîin which case we will call them mutual strangers; or they might have met before‚Äîin which case we will call them mutual acquaintances. The theorem says: :In any party of six people either at least three of them are (pairwise) mutual strangers or at least three of them are (pairwise) mutual acquaintances. Conversion to a graph-theoretic setting A proof of the theorem requires nothing but a three-step logic. It is convenient to phrase the problem in graph-theoretic language. Suppose a graph has 6 vertices and every pair of (distinct) vertices is joined by an edge. Such a graph is called a complete graph (because there cannot be any more edges). A complete graph on n vertices is denoted by the symbol K_n. Now take a K_6. It has 15 edges in all. Let the 6 vertices stand for the 6 people in our party. Let the edges be coloured red or blue depending on whether the two people represented by the vertices connected by the edge are mutual strangers or mutual acquaintances, respectively. The theorem now asserts: :No matter how you colour the 15 edges of a K_6 with red and blue, you cannot avoid having either a red triangle‚Äîthat is, a triangle all of whose three sides are red, representing three pairs of mutual strangers‚Äîor a blue triangle, representing three pairs of mutual acquaintances. In other words, whatever colours you use, there will always be at least one monochromatic triangle ( that is, a triangle all of whose edges have the same color ). Sketch of a proof Choose any one vertex; call it P. There are five edges leaving P. They are each coloured red or blue. The pigeonhole principle says that at least three of them must be of the same colour; for if there are less than three of one colour, say red, then there are at least three that are blue. Let A, B, C be the other ends of these three edges, all of the same colour, say blue. If any one of AB, BC, CA is blue, then that edge together with the two edges from P to the edge's endpoints forms a blue triangle. If none of AB, BC, CA is blue, then all three edges are red and we have a red triangle, namely, ABC. Ramsey's paper The utter simplicity of this argument, which so powerfully produces a very interesting conclusion, is what makes the theorem appealing. In 1930, in a paper entitled 'On a Problem in Formal Logic,' Frank P. Ramsey proved a very general theorem (now known as Ramsey's theorem) of which this theorem is a simple case. This theorem of Ramsey forms the foundation of the area known as Ramsey theory in combinatorics. Boundaries to the theorem A 2-colouring of K5 with no monochromatic K3 The conclusion to the theorem does not hold if we replace the party of six people by a party of less than six. To show this, we give a coloring of K5 with red and blue that does not contain a triangle with all edges the same color. We draw K5 as a pentagon surrounding a star (a pentagram). We color the edges of the pentagon red and the edges of the star blue. Thus, 6 is the smallest number for which we can claim the conclusion of the theorem. In Ramsey theory, we write this fact as: : R(3,3: 2) = 6. References *V. Krishnamurthy. Culture, Excitement and Relevance of Mathematics, Wiley Eastern, 1990. .

History The band was formed in September 1995 by Erika (vocals, musical arrangements) and Ted (keyboards and piano, musical arrangements, vocals). After an intensive period of song writing and rehearsing, they entered West Sound Studios and committed to tape the works they had created. In April 1996, their first CD, \\"Love Poems for Dying Children... Act I\\" was released through Dark Symphonies, their own record label. The music of \\"Love Poems...\\" consisted of symphonic arrangements designed to evoke intense emotions of sadness and loneliness in the listener. Influences include ancient chants, classical music, and contemporary artists (Dead Can Dance, Anchorage, Stoa, Enya). In May 1997, Autumn Tears released their second full-length album, \\"The Garden of Crystalline Dreams - Love Poems for Dying Children: Act II.\\" Erika left Autumn Tears after \\"Act II's\\" release to pursue writing her novel. New vocalist Jennifer LeeAnna was recruited, reportedly due to respect for her talent and experience. The first release of \\"Act I\\" was originally supposed to be limited to 2000 copies, but an overwhelming number of requests once it had sold out, it was re-released with a new layout and artwork in 1998. All tracks were remixed and remastered and, as a bonus, an additional and exclusive track titled \\"The Intermission\\" was included on the repress; it was Jennifer LeeAnna's debut appearance in the band. In December 1999, Erika rejoined Autumn Tears as a full-time member. In July 1999, Autumn Tears released a mini-CD titled \\"Absolution.\\" In June 2000, The band finished their third full-length album and most ambitious release so far, \\"Love Poems for Dying Children, Act III: Winter and the Broken Angel.\\" In 2004, after four years of silence, the band recorded the album \\"Eclipse\\", which is described, on the Autumn Tears Official Homepage, as \\"the most epic, conceptual, and fullest neoclassical piece of music they have ever offered. Lush strings, acoustic guitars, and woodwinds accompany soaring orchestral soundscapes, painting the backdrop for a staggering array of vocal performances that range from operatic and classical solos to Baltic choral passages and duets.\\" In the Eclipse recording, Ted Tringo had invited new musicians to join Autumn Tears, such as the female vocalist Laurie Ann Haus (Todesbonden) which shared the female voices with Erika in almost all their tracks. After the release, Erika left Autumn Tears to form her new band, Ignitor. In 2007, Autumn Tears released \\"The Hallowing\\" said to be their final release. The liner notes for the 2008 re-issue of Love Poems... Act I makes note than the band have not broken up, they are just in hibernation (probably similar to the periods 2001-2004 and 2004-2007). It is also noted that the other two albums in the Love Poems... trilogy, \\"The Garden of Chrystalline Dreams\\" & \\"Winter and the Broken Angel\\" will also be re-released in special editions in the not-too-distant future.

This was replaced in 2016 by Newshub Late. Format Nightline, hosted usually in the 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm timeslot, had a high focus on the arts and current events. It competed directly with TVNZ's Tonight programme. Nightline generally ran the entire year, its timeslot being pushed later on some occasions to cater to long-running programmes, but traditionally took a short break over the Christmas period. Previous hosts have included Rachel Smalley, Sam Hayes, Carly Flynn, Carolyn Robinson, Leanne Malcolm, Sarah Bradley, Joanna Paul and Belinda Todd, with the latter two being the programme's original hosts in 1990. Cancellation In early 2014, MediaWorks confirmed that The Paul Henry Show would replace Nightline. A release from Mediaworks said: \\"The Nightline brand remains a valued part of the 3 News stable and will sit in reserve.\\" According to Rachel Lorimer, group communication manager for news and current affairs at Mediaworks, this means, \\"that the [Nightline] brand will be available for use in future years.\\" Over the last few years the programme had struggled to maintain its viewership, and Mediaworks felt that it was time for change.

In the release, Mark Jennings, director of news and current affairs at Mediaworks, said, \\"Nightline has been a great programme for us over many years and produced some of our best broadcasters, but the landscape is due for change and Paul Henry will lead that change in later evening viewing.\\" TV3 cancelled The Paul Henry Show at the end of 2014 and broadcast a temporary bulletin in the slot known as 3 News Late Edition with rotating anchors hosting.

The district is commonly defined as the area enclosed by the ring road of Ring 1 (also referred to as Ringgaden), and in the west by the Aarhus Harbour and shoreline. Aarhus C is an abbreviation of Aarhus Centrum, which means \\"the centre of Aarhus\\" and is home to around 55,000 citizens. Quarters and areas Aarhus √Ö (Aarhus River) flows through Midtbyen. Narrow street in Vesterbro Skanseparken, Frederiksbjerg. Small city parks are numerous in Aarhus C. Isbjerget (lit.: the iceberg) one of the new apartment blocks in Aarhus Docklands. The Book Tower, in yellow brick and tile, is a landmark for Aarhus University. =Midtbyen= Midtbyen is the oldest part of Aarhus and was where the city originated, and is therefore known as the city's historical center. It is characterized by narrow, winding, cobbled streets and many small shops, and a large part of the area is car free and has been pedestrianised. The square of Store Torv in front of the cathedral forms a natural centre of the pedestrian zone. The main walking route through Midtbyen is the long pedestrian street of Str√∏get, which runs from the cathedral to the central train station. Apart from the small boutiques, Midtbyen also presents large department stores and the shopping centre Bruun's Galleri with 93 stores. The main routes by car in Midtbyen are via one of the three roads: N√∏rre All√©, Vestre All√© and S√∏ndre All√©. =Vesterbro= Vesterbro should not be confused with Vesterbro in the capital, Copenhagen. Aarhus' Vesterbro is newer than Midtbyen, and was originally the western entrance to the town, which is why there are street names such as Vesterport, literally meaning Western-gate. The main square of Vesterbro Torv used to be a market square for pigs and other animals in the 1880s. Now it is the busiest junction in Vesterbro. Half a mile west of Vesterbro Torv is one of the city's most famous landmarks, Den Gamle By, located within Aarhus Botanical Gardens. Right next to Den Gamle By is the now defunct Ceres Brewery from 1856. The site of the old brewery is currently being transformed and rebuilt into a new neighbourhood of Vesterbro, presenting educational institutions, residential apartments, offices and businesses. =Frederiksbjerg= Frederiksbjerg is located south of Midtbyen and the central station. Its name literally means Frederik's hill or mountain. Separated by a wide railway yard, it is connected to the inner city by three bridges. It is inhabited by approximately 20,000 people. Frederiksbjerg has around 400 shops mainly located in the three large shopping streets Bruunsgade, J√¶gerg√•rdsgade, Frederiks All√©. Frederiks All√© is a main route leading into the City from the suburbs, and going out of Frederiksbjerg it changes name to Skanderborgvej, as it historically was the main road to the town of Skanderborg. Frederiksbjerg is a quieter part of Aarhus C, with most buildings dating from the beginning of the 20th century, and with many large apartments, suitable for families with children. =Aarhus Docklands= Aarhus Docklands is the newest part of Aarhus C. The area is founded on both newly constructed land and former wharves, bought by the municipality from the Port of Aarhus company in 2007 and is not yet fully developed. There have been many ambitious development projects here, including the proposition of a 144m tall Light House building, which would have become Denmark's tallest building. Parts of this project were postponed due to the 2008 financial crisis. The city plans to develop Aarhus Docklands as a new modern neighbourhood with canals, parks and modern architecture.Aarhus Municipality: De Byn√¶re Havnearelaer =University of Aarhus= The University of Aarhus campus is located immediately north of Midtbyen, with most buildings situated in and around the recreational parks of Universitetsparken and Vennelystparken. The whole campus, including the parks, has been designed with a common architectural outlook, characterized by yellow brick and tile, and the landscaped park was protected by national law in 1993. New buildings - also in yellow brick and tile - have continuously been added in and around the original campus ever since construction began in 1932. Aarhus University also administers other departments and buildings across town, including Nobelparken completed in 2004 just north of the original campus.

Six main roads radiates outwards from Aarhus C, connecting to nearby larger cities. This comprise the roads of Gren√•vej, Randersvej, Viborgvej, Silkeborgvej, Skanderborgvej and Oddervej. = Bicycles = Bicycle parking at Aarhus Central Station Bicycles are a popular vehicle for transportation in all of Denmark. Most major roads have bicycle lanes reserved for cyclists and the cycling infrastructure is highly developed. In Aarhus, new routes prioritized for cyclists have opened in the 2000s and this includes the streets of Skolegade, Mejlgade and Frederiks Gade in Aarhus C. The shared bikeways of Brabrandstien and Hallssti (and others), used by both pedestrians and cyclists have been in operation for many years, however. Many major roads in the central district have bicycle lanes or some other form of cycling infrastructure, but not all. Two national and five regional cycling routes pass through Aarhus C.Aarhus Municipality: Cykelruter √Örhus Cykelby.dk Aarhus City Bikes (Aarhus Bycykel) is a public bicycle sharing system with around 50 hubs in Aarhus C and a few in Aarhus N. The system is only in operation from April through October. Bike taxi services has been popping up in Aarhus C in the 2010s. Some companies rides customers all year round, also on trips outside Aarhus C occasionally. Bike taxis are not a common sight in the city, but can sometimes be picked up at the central spots of Baneg√•rdspladsen, Lille Torv, Store Torv, √Öboulevarden or near ordinary taxicab services and they tend to be more active during weekends, city festivals and larger events.Aarhus Stifstidende: Aarhus set fra en sofaAarhus Panorama: Fuld Fart Fremtidstaxa =Bus= Aarhus, and Aarhus C in particular, has a tight net of bus lines. Most city bus lines go through the inner city with stops at either Park All√© or Baneg√•rdspladsen (Central Station Square) or both. Many lines continue through Midtbyen, by a special road-lane reserved for buses, with several stops. County and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal, located immediately north east of the Central Station. = Car = Several roads in Aarhus C are heavy with motorized traffic, but in most of the district car traffic is highly regulated. Apart from a few major roads, car traffic in Aarhus C is heavily regulated. This includes speed limits, one-way streets, roads prioritized for cyclists and restricted areas. There are several large commercial car parking facilities and a system of electronic road-side panels display the changing parking load in an effort to make more efficient use of the parking space altogether. Finding a legal and available spot for road-side parking, is difficult.Parkering i AarhusParkerings-info: Alt om parkering i Aarhus =Rail= Aarhus is connected to the rest of Denmark with inter-city and commuter rail, and Aarhus Central Station serves as a major hub for rail traffic in Denmark. Many trains terminates here while others pass through and continue to other parts of the country. The station is mainly served by DSB, but Arriva also has several lines terminating here. There is no metro or S-train system in Aarhus to serve the city itself, but Aarhus Light Rail opened in December 2017. It is an electrically propelled tram system and the first of its kind in Denmark. The light rail will be expanded with more lines in the coming years. = Walking = Larger parts of the inner city of Aarhus has been pedestrianized and walking is an easy, safe and popular means of transportation in Aarhus C. Many important facilities and institutions are located within the district and easily reached on foot. Wheel-chair ramps and elevators for the handicapped are to be found in all public buildings in Denmark and this includes Aarhus as well. Public toilets in the streets are almost exclusively coin-operated, automatic, pay toilets and unisex, so it is advised to stack a few spare coins in the pocket.

It is currently only known from males from the Amazon basin of Brazil and from northern Argentina. Taxonomy The genus was established by Kusnezov (1953) for four small male ants collected in the Tucum√°n region of Argentina. Kusnezov recognized a single species, Amyrmex golbachi, which he placed in the subfamily Dolichoderinae, while noting peculiar features of the wing venation and abdominal morphology that introduced some uncertainty about its affinities. Since its original description, Amyrmex has received scant attention from ant taxonomists. In his generic revision of the Dolichoderinae, Shattuck (1992) synonymized Amyrmex under Forelius. Cuezzo (2000) resurrected Amyrmex, pointing out various distinctive features of morphology that do not agree with any known males of Forelius. Phylogenetic analyses by Ward & Brady (2009) placed Amyrmex as a sister genus to Leptanilloides and a member of the subfamily Leptanilloidinae (now Dorylinae), rather than the Dolichoderinae to which it had been previously assigned. This placement is also supported by morphological traits. Distribution The genus is currently only known from males from the Amazon basin of Brazil and from northern Argentina. No Amyrmex specimens have been reported besides the holotype, three paratypes, one additional series of males from the Kusnezov collection, and a collection of several males discovered from unidentified specimens in the Bohart Museum of Entomology, most of which were collected in malaise traps at a lowland rainforest site in Rond√¥nia, Brazil, in 1991. The geographical distribution of Amyrmex suggests it might be a senior synonym of the sister genus Asphinctanilloides.

The first system was initially observed in the northeastern Caribbean Sea on June 11\\\\. The fourteen and final system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Bermuda on November 5\\\\. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Eight of the fourteen tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Of the season's fourteen tropical cyclones, thirteen became a tropical storm, and six of those strengthened into a hurricane. With no major hurricanes occurring in the following year, 1901 and 1902 were the first time that two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since 1864 and 1865. The fourth and eighth systems were the deadliest and most damaging storms of season. The fourth storm, known as the Louisiana hurricane, which left about $1 million (1901 USD) in damage and 10-15 fatalities in Louisiana. In September, the eighth cyclone impacted some islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, including Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba. There were five fatalities during boating accidents in Virginia. At the French overseas territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, three people drowned after a schooner capsized. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project also indicated but could not confirm the presence of an additional tropical storm in October 1901, instead listing the cyclone as a tropical depression. However, the reanalysis added a previously undetected hurricane in late August to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT). The seventh tropical cyclone that year was the strongest by maximum sustained winds, peaking at 105 mph (165 km/h), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane. However, the fourth hurricane had a lower barometric pressure and was thus the most intense storm of the season. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1901 till:01/12/1901 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1901 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_(TD)_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(119‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:11/06/1901 till:15/06/1901 color:TS text:\\"One\\" (TS) from:01/07/1901 till:10/07/1901 color:TS text:\\"Two\\" (TS) from:04/07/1901 till:13/07/1901 color:C1 text:\\"Three\\" (C1) from:02/08/1901 till:16/08/1901 color:C1 text:\\"Four\\" (C1) from:18/08/1901 till:22/08/1901 color:TS text:\\"Five\\" (TS) from:25/08/1901 till:30/08/1901 color:C1 text:\\"Six\\" (TS) from:29/08/1901 till:10/09/1901 color:C2 text:\\"Seven\\" (C2) barset:break from:09/09/1901 till:18/09/1901 color:C1 text:\\"Eight\\" (C1) from:12/09/1901 till:17/09/1901 color:TS text:\\"Nine\\" (TS) from:21/09/1901 till:29/09/1901 color:TS text:\\"Ten\\" (TS) from:04/10/1901 till:05/10/1901 color:TD text:\\"Depression\\" (TD) from:05/10/1901 till:10/10/1901 color:TS text:\\"Eleven\\" (TS) from:15/10/1901 till:18/10/1901 color:TS text:\\"Twelve\\" (TS) from:30/10/1901 till:05/11/1901 color:C1 text:\\"Thirteen\\" (C1) bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1901 till:01/07/1901 text:June from:01/07/1901 till:01/08/1901 text:July from:01/08/1901 till:01/09/1901 text:August from:01/09/1901 till:01/10/1901 text:September from:01/10/1901 till:01/11/1901 text:October from:01/11/1901 till:01/12/1901 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Tropical cyclogenesis began with the development of the first tropical storm on June 11 in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. July featured two tropical storms, one of which strengthened into a hurricane. By July 5, the season had three tropical storms. In comparison, the average date of development of the first tropical storm between 1944 and 1996 was July 11. August was the most active month of the season. There were four tropical storms, three of which intensified into hurricanes. The fourth system was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of . Although the seventh cyclone was a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), a lower minimum barometric pressure was not recorded. In September, three additional system formed, one of which became a hurricane. October featured the same amount of activity, but also had a short-lived tropical depression. The season's final system developed on October 30 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 5\\\\. With a total of 13 tropical storms, this was the most active season without a major hurricane until 2013, which had 14 named storms and no systems reaching at least Category 3. The seventh storm was considered a major hurricane until reanalysis by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz in 1997, who revised the intensity to a Category 2 hurricane because observations did not support Category 3\\\\. In 2008, an additional hurricane was added to HURDAT, which existed in late August over the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. A tropical depression in early October may have become a tropical storm, but data was inconclusive. Nearly all of the season's 14 tropical cyclones impacted land. Collectively, the storms caused over $1 million in damage and at least 35-40 fatalities.   The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 99. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. Systems =Tropical Storm One= The first tropical depression of the season developed over the Caribbean Sea just west of the Cayman Islands on June 11\\\\. Moving northeastward, it strengthened into a tropical storm shortly before landfall in western Cuba early the next day. Locations such as Havana recorded rainfall, but no unusually strong winds. Thereafter, the storm moved generally northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and likely maintained the same intensity as a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm. On the east coast of Florida, a wind speed of was observed in Jupiter. At 21:00 UTC on June 13, the cyclone made landfall near Carrabelle, Florida. Charleston, South Carolina, far from the center, observed winds of . Although the system weakened to a depression by early on June 14, it persisted until dissipating over Illinois late on June 15\\\\. =Tropical Storm Two= The second storm of the season was first observed on July 1 about 225 miles (360 km) north of the modern day French Guiana-Suriname border. The cyclone intensified slowly and moved northwestward, reaching the Windward Islands early on July 3\\\\. Around that time, the cyclone passed between Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, with little impact. By July 5, the system peaked as a strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), while beginning to curve west-northwestward over the eastern Caribbean Sea. In Dominican Republic, flooding occurred in the region between Cotu√≠, Santo Domingo, and Vega Real, with rivers overflowing their banks. Additionally, high winds knocked out telegraphic communication with the city of Santo Domingo. Strong winds and \\"severe rain\\" were reported in Haiti, where several vessels along the coast were wrecked. Fourteen deaths occurred, with nine in Les Cayes and five in Jacmel. Later on July 5, the storm passed to the southwest of the Tiburon Peninsula. Thereafter, the storm paralleled the south coast of Cuba, until making landfall in Pinar del R√≠o Province late on July 7\\\\. Abnormally high tides and strong winds caused flooding in a majority of homes along the south coast of the province. Early on July 8, the system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. The Weather Bureau office in Galveston, Texas, began warning residents of the approaching cyclone on July 9. The system weakened while approaching the coast, and around 10:00 UTC on the following day, it made landfall near Matagorda with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Some locations reported tropical storm force winds. Tides caused water to reach waterfront streets in Galveston. The storm quickly weakened and dissipated late on July 10\\\\. =Hurricane Three= Hurricane San Cirilo of 1901 A tropical depression developed about north of Paramaribo, Suriname, early on July 4\\\\. The cyclone moved northwestward and intensified into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. Late on July 5, the storm either brushed or struck Martinique. The system soon entered the Caribbean Sea and continued to strengthen. It brushed near the southwestern tip of Puerto Rico early on July 7\\\\. Several hours the storm made landfall north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, 70 mph (110 km/h) and then briefly emerged into the Atlantic before striking the Saman√° Peninsula. By 18:00 UTC on July 7, the system reemerged into the Atlantic. Early the following day, the cyclone brushed East Caicos as a strong tropical storm. It curved northeastward late on July 9 and resumed intensification, likely due to the warm sea surface temperatures over the Gulf Stream. Early on July 10, the storm became a hurricane, shortly before peaking with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , both of which were observed by ships. The hurricane recurved to the west early on July 11 and made landfall between Kill Devil Hills and Nags Head in North Carolina at the same intensity. Quickly weakening to a tropical storm after a few hours, the cyclone southwestward and reemerged into the Atlantic early on July 12\\\\. Turning to the west-northwest, it made landfall near modern-day Kure Beach at 22:00 UTC with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Late on July 13, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over South Carolina shortly thereafter. \\"Considerable damage\\" was reported in Saint Kitts. The storm is known as San Cirilo in Puerto Rico, where heavy rainfall occurred, particularly in the southwestern portion of the island, with observed at Hacienda La Perla. Flooding was reported along the R√≠o Grande de Lo√≠za and Caugus rivers. The Weather Bureau office in San Juan observed a wind speed of . In Virginia, winds averaged at Cape Henry late on July 10 through early on July 11, downing power lines in the area. A woman in Richmond was killed after being hit by a tree that was struck by lightning. A number of trees were level and lost their fruit due to heavy rainfall and strong winds in Berryville. A barn was destroyed after being struck by lightning and set ablaze. At Chesapeake Bay, artillery practice was interrupted after strong winds destroyed the floating targets. In North Carolina, winds reached at Hatteras. =Hurricane Four= The Louisiana Hurricane of 1901 A tropical depression developed about southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on August 2\\\\. Moving southwestward and later westward, the depression remained weak for several days, until strengthening into a tropical storm while approaching the Bahamas early on August 9\\\\. It then crossed through the islands and intensified only slightly. Late on August 10, the storm made landfall near Deerfield Beach, Florida. After reaching the Gulf of Mexico the next day, the storm continued to intensify and reached hurricane status on August 12\\\\. Early on August 13, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). After weakening slightly, the cyclone struck Louisiana late on August 14 and then Mississippi less than 24 hours later. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on August 16 and became extratropical several hours later. Thereafter, the remnants persisted until dissipating over Indiana late on August 18\\\\. Along portions of the east coast of Florida, \\"considerable damage\\" was reported due to strong winds. In Alabama, trees were uprooted, houses were de- roofed, and chimneys collapsed in Mobile. Some areas of the city were also inundated with up to of water due to storm tide. Several yachts, schooners, and ships were wrecked or sunk, resulting in at least $70,000 in damage. However, due to warnings by the Weather Bureau, the Mobile Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded. All towns along the coast of Mississippi \\"suffered seriously\\". In Louisiana, severe damage was reported at some towns due to strong winds and high tides. The community of Port Eads reported that only the lighthouse was not destroyed, while other sources state that an office building also remained standing. In New Orleans, overflowing levees inundated numerous streets. Outside the city, crops suffered severely, particularly rice. Overall, the storm caused 10‚Äì15 deaths and $1 million in damage. =Tropical Storm Five= A tropical depression developed about 415 mi (670 km) south-southwest of Paramaribo, Suriname, on August 18\\\\. The system moved just north of due west throughout its duration and deepened into a tropical storm about 24 hours later. On August 20, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Late on August 20, the storm passed through the Windward Islands just north of Grenada. According to Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands Robert Baxter Llewelyn, no damage occurred on Grenada. At Barbados, three lighters and a schooner, the Myosettis, were wrecked. The jetties and vessels at them were destroyed on Saint Vincent. After reaching the Caribbean, the cyclone began weakening, probably due to colder sea surface temperatures and the storm's proximity to South America. On August 21, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression. Continuing westward, it dissipated at 18:00 UTC on the following day while situated about west-northwest of Aruba. =Hurricane Six= A tropical storm was first observed just east of Boa Vista in the Cape Verde Islands on August 25\\\\. The storm moved west-northwest and struck the island with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) a few hours later. After reaching the open Atlantic, the system intensified and reached hurricane status early on August 27\\\\. Later that day, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), an observation from the Norwegian barque Professor Johnson. The hurricane began weakening early on August 28 and fell to tropical storm intensity shortly thereafter. By late on August 30, the storm was analysed to have dissipated about 1,145 mi (1,845 km) northwest of Santo Ant√£o in the Cape Verde Islands. =Hurricane Seven= Historical weather maps indicate that a tropical depression developed about southeast of Praia, Cape Verde, early on August 29. Six hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. While passing south of Cape Verde on August 29, the storm brought rough seas to the islands, sinking two vessels. Strong winds and torrential rainfall damaged coffee and sugar cane crops and houses. Livestock and people were killed. Thereafter, the storm slowly strengthened while continuing westward into the open Atlantic for a few days, until a slight curve to the west- northwest by August 31\\\\. The system intensified into a Category 1 hurricane around 12:00 UTC on September 1\\\\. Continuing to deepen, the cyclone became a Category 2 hurricane on September 3\\\\. By the following day, it turned northward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The hurricane would maintain this intensity for a few days, until curving northeastward on September 6, at which time it began to slowly weaken. By September 8, the storm turned to the east and fell to Category 1 status. Around this time, a barometric pressure of was observed, the lowest recorded in relation to the cyclone. The hurricane soon recurved back to the northeast and accelerated. Late on September 10, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about north-northeast of Corvo Island in the Azores. The remnants moved quickly northeastward and dissipated southwest of Ireland on September 11\\\\. =Hurricane Eight= Hurricane San Vicente of 1901 A tropical storm was first observed about east of Guadeloupe early on September 9\\\\. The system tracked generally westward and deepened slowly. On September 11, the grazed several islands of the northern Lesser Antilles, including Barbuda, Saint Barth√©lemy, and Saba. Early the following day, the cyclone struck Puerto Rico with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), several hours before making made landfall in Dominican Republic near Punta Cana at the same intensity. The storm weakened while crossing Hispaniola, before emerging into the Caribbean Sea early on September 13\\\\. While passing to the south of Cuba, the system intensified, becoming a hurricane on September 14 near Cayman Brac. Early the following day, the storm peaked with sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum pressure of , the latter was measured by a ship while the former was estimated during reanalysis. The hurricane soon curved west- northwestward and later passed near Cape San Antonio, Cuba, on September 15\\\\. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm. By September 17, it turned north-northeastward and made landfall in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, at 20:00 UTC with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The system then moved rapidly northeastward and became extratropical about 75 mi (120 km) east of Hatteras Island in North Carolina late on September 18\\\\. The remnants dissipated offshore New England about 24 hours later. In Puerto Rico, the storm was known as San Vicente. Rainfall peaked at in San Salvador, while winds in San Juan reached . Minor damage occurred to citrus and coffee crops, while bananas suffered severe losses. A telegraph report from Haiti indicated heavy rainstorms and strong winds in the vicinity of Cap-Ha√Øtien. In Cuba, several ships were beached along the bay at Santiago de Cuba. A few streets in Bataban√≥ were inundated with at least of water. The system caused a significant amount of rain across Georgia and the Carolinas, with the maximum amount reported at Americus, Georgia. Offshore Virginia, rough seas resulted in the wrecking or sinking of several vessels. The schooner Idle Times collided with a Pennsylvania Railroad barge, killing the schooner's captain. Four sailors drowned offshore Ocean View. At Newport News, of rain fell in a period of 24 hours, which became the highest daily precipitation total for the month of September. Significant damage occurred in the Maryland city of Braddock, with few homes, barns, or farm buildings not sustaining any impact. In Poplar Terrace, a water tank was swept away from a house. The hospital in Montevue was partially deroofed. Twelve barns were overturned in Liberty and corn crops were ruined. At Saint Pierre, the schooner J. W. Roberts was beached, drowning three people. =Tropical Storm Nine= Ships reports and historical weather maps indicated that the storm was first observed early on September 12, while located about southwest of Brava in the Cape Verde Islands. The system strengthened slowly while moving north-northwestward and later north-northeastward across the eastern Atlantic. Early on September 14, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Thereafter, it curved northwestward and began to deteriorate very slowly, weakening to a tropical depression late on September 17\\\\. Soon after, the system dissipated about 505 mi (815 km) northwest of Santo Ant√£o. =Tropical Storm Ten= Early on September 21, the tenth tropical storm of the season was first observed about 125 mi (200 km) northwest of the Guajira Peninsula, according to data from ships and historical weather maps. Initially the storm moved west-northwestward, before curving to the north-northwest over the northwestern Caribbean Sea early on September 25\\\\. Later that day, the cyclone began to intensify, after possibly maintaining the same intensity since September 21\\\\. The storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), several hours before making landfall in western Pinar del R√≠o Province in Cuba around 18:00 UTC. Some areas of Cuba experienced heavy rainfall, particularly Bataban√≥, where several streets were inundated. Late on September 25, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. The system soon curved north- northeastward and began to accelerate and slowly weaken. At 03:00 UTC on September 28, it made landfall in modern-day Lanark Village, Florida, just east of Carrabelle, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The cyclone rapidly lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Georgia around 12:00 UTC. However, the remnants lasted until October 2, after crossing the Eastern United States and Atlantic Canada, and then dissipating southeast of Greenland. The storm brought fairly strong winds to Florida and the southern portions of the East Coast of the United States. =Tropical depression= Based on historical weather maps, a tropical depression formed offshore Guinea on October 4\\\\. The depression moved west-northwestward and may have intensified into a tropical storm, but data was sparse and inconclusive. It probably dissipated by October 5. =Tropical Storm Eleven= This storm was first observed by ships about north-northeast of Paramaribo early on October 5. Initially drifting northwestward, the storm gradually accelerated while deepening slowly. The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on October 7, based on ship observations. By the following day, the storm began to weaken and slowly lose tropical characteristics. The system curved northward on October 10 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day, while situated about west-southwest of Bermuda. The remnants persisted for a few days while moving northeast, until dissipating well northwest of the Azores on October 14\\\\. =Tropical Storm Twelve= A tropical depression formed about south of Trinidad, Cuba, on October 15\\\\. The depression moved northeastward without strengthening and struck Sancti Sp√≠ritus Province shortly thereafter. A few cities observed rainfall. Upon reaching the southwestern Atlantic Ocean late on October 15, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Further deepening occurred as the storm moved northeastward into the Bahamas, where it made landfall on or brushed Long Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador Island on October 16\\\\. That day around 12:00 UTC, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Thereafter, the system began weakening and losing tropical characteristics, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone early on October 18 while located about south-southwest of Bermuda. Several hours later, the remnants dissipated. =Hurricane Thirteen= The final storm of the season developed as a tropical depression about 55 mi (90 km) north-northwest of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, on October 30\\\\. Moving north-northeastward, the depression became a tropical storm by early on October 31\\\\. Later that day, the storm curved to the northeast. During the next few days, further intensification occurred, with the cyclone reaching hurricane status late on October 28\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of ; the latter was observed by a ship, while the former was estimated using the subtropical wind-pressure relationship. While passing southeast of Bermuda, the storm ruined crops and caused considerable damage to some buildings. The system began to deteriorate gradually after peak intensity, weakening to a tropical storm early on November 4\\\\. Early the following day, the cyclone curved east-southeastward. By 00:00 UTC on November 6, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about southeast of Sable Island. The remnants continued east-southeastward until dissipating late on November 6\\\\.

A mudflow or mud flow is a form of mass wasting involving \\"very rapid to extremely rapid surging flow\\" of debris that has become partially or fully liquified by the addition of significant amounts of water to the source material.; Mudflows contain a significant proportion of clay, which makes them more fluid than debris flows; thus, they are able to travel farther and across lower slope angles. Both types are generally mixtures of various kinds of materials of different sizes, which are typically sorted by size upon deposition. Mudflows are often called mudslides, a term applied indiscriminately by the mass media to a variety of mass wasting events. Mudflows often start as slides, becoming flows as water is entrained along the flow path; such events are often called flow slides.; Other types of mudflows include lahars (involving fine-grained pyroclastic deposits on the flanks of volcanoes) and j√∂kulhlaups (outbursts from under glaciers or icecaps). A statutory definition of \\"flood-related mudslide\\" appears in the United States' National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, codified at 42 USC Sections 4001 and following.  Triggering of mudflows  The Mameyes mudflow disaster, in barrio Tibes, Ponce, Puerto Rico, was caused by heavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Isabel in 1985. The mudflow destroyed more than 100 homes and claimed an estimated 300 lives. Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of groundwater flowing through cracked bedrock may trigger a movement of soil or sediments in landslides that continue as mudflows. Floods and debris flows may also occur when strong rains on hill or mountain slopes cause extensive erosion and/or mobilize loose sediment that is located in steep mountain channels. The 2006 Sidoarjo mud flow may have been caused by rogue drilling. The point where a muddy material begins to flow depends on its grain size, the water content, and the slope of the topography. Fine grained material like mud or sand can be mobilized by shallower flows than a coarse sediment or a debris flow. Higher water content (higher precipitation/overland flow) also increases the potential to initiate a mudflow Iverson RM, Reid ME, LaHusen RG. Debris- flow mobilization from landslides. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences. 1997 May;25(1):85-138.. After a mudflow forms, coarser sediment may be picked up by the flow. Coarser sediment picked up by the flow often forms the front of a mudflow surge and is pushed by finer sediment and water that pools up behind the coarse-grained moving mudflow-front Fletcher, L., Hungr, O. and Evans, S.G., 2002. Contrasting failure behaviour of two large landslides in clay and silt. Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 39(1), pp.46-62.. Mudflows may contain multiple surges of material as the flow scours channels and destabilizes adjacent hillslopes (potentially nucleating new mudflows).

Erosion of steepland valleys by debris flows. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 118(9-10), pp.1125-1148.. Some broad mudflows are rather viscous and therefore slow; others begin very quickly and continue like an avalanche. They are composed of at least 50% silt and clay-sized materials and up to 30% water. Because mudflows mobilize a significant amount of sediment, mudflows have higher flow heights than a clear water flood for the same water discharge. Also, sediment within the mudflow increases granular friction within the flow structure of the flow relative to clear water floods, which raises the flow depth for the same water discharge Kean, J.W., Staley, D.M. and Cannon, S.H., 2011.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 116(F4).. Difficulty predicting the amount and type of sediment that will be included in a mudflow makes it much more challenging to forecast and engineer structures to protect against mudflow hazards compared to clear water flood hazards. Mudflows are common even in the hills around Los Angeles, California, where they have destroyed many homes built on hillsides without sufficient support after fires destroy vegetation holding the land. On December 14, 1999 in Vargas, Venezuela, a mudflow known as The Vargas tragedy significantly altered more than 60 kilometers (37 mi) of the coastline. It was triggered by heavy rainfall and caused estimated damages of US$1.79 to US$3.5 billion, killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people, forced 85,000 people to evacuate, and led to the complete collapse of the state's infrastructure.  Mudflows and landslides  Landslide is a more general term than mudflow. It refers to the gravity-driven failure and subsequent movement downslope of any types of surface movement of soil, rock, or other debris. The term incorporates earth slides, rock falls, flows, and mudslides, amongst other categories of hillslope mass movements. They do not have to be as fluid as a mudflow. Mudflows can be caused by unusually heavy rains or a sudden thaw. They consist mainly of mud and water plus fragments of rock and other debris, so they often behave like floods. They can move houses off their foundations or bury a place within minutes because of incredibly strong currents.  Mudflow geography  When a mudflow occurs it is given four named areas, the 'main scarp', in bigger mudflows the 'upper and lower shelves' and the 'toe'. The main scarp will be the original area of incidence, the toe is the last affected area(s). The upper and lower shelves are located wherever there is a large dip (due to mountain or natural drop) in the mudflow's path. A mudflow can have many shelves. Largest recorded mudflow The world's largest historic landslide (in terms of volume) occurred during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, a volcano in the Cascade Mountain Range in the State of Washington, USA. The volume of material displaced was . Directly in the path of the huge mudflow was Spirit Lake. Normally a chilly , the lahar instantly raised the temperature to near . Today the bottom of Spirit Lake is above the original surface, and it has two and a half times more surface area than it did before the eruption. The world's largest known prehistoric terrestrial landslide took place in southwestern Iran, and is named the Saidmarreh landslide. The landslide was on the Kabir Kuh anticline at 33.0¬∞N, 47.65¬∞E. The landslide had a volume of about , a depth of , a travel distance of , and a width of . This means that about 50 billion tons of rock moved in this single event. The largest known of all prehistoric landslides was an enormous submarine landslide that disintegrated 60,000 years ago and produced the longest flow of sand and mud yet documented on Earth. The massive submarine flow travelled ‚Äì the distance from London to Rome. By volume, the largest submarine landslide (the Agulhas slide off South Africa) occurred approximately 2.6 million years ago. The volume of the slide was . Areas at risk The area most generally recognized as being at risk of a dangerous mudflow are: * Areas where wildfires or human modification of the land have destroyed vegetation * Areas where landslides have occurred before * Steep slopes and areas at the bottom of slopes or canyons * Slopes that have been altered for construction of buildings and roads * Channels along streams and rivers * Areas where surface runoff is directed See also *Quick clay, also known as Leda clay  Notes  Citations References *. *.

Its name comes from Tigre, the city in which it was founded by Jos√© Dellagiovanna on August 3, 1902. Its colors are France blue and vermilion red. The football team is its main activity. It plays his home games at the Jose Dellagiovanna Stadium, located in Victoria, Buenos Aires, which has a capacity of 26,282 spectators. It currently plays in the Second Division of Argentine football. In a historical event in Argentine professional football, it will simultaneously play the 2020 Copa Libertadores, a contest to which he agreed to be champion of the 2019 Copa de la Superliga (first official title in its history). History 1912: It became champion of the Intermediate Division and promoted to the First Division, defeating V√©lez Sarsfield in the final by 4 to 2, in which it made his official debut on May 1 from 1913. At that time it was a great entertainer of the highest category doing some very good campaigns and others not so much. It participated in the First Division in the amateur era for 18 uninterrupted years, and continued in the category at the beginning of the professional era in 1931. The squad's first professional match was on 31 May 1931, playing against San Lorenzo in the Viejo Gas√≥metro stadium. The first win came in the 3rd fixture when Tigre defeated Racing Club by 1-0. 1932: Tigre at the beginning of the year, in the sum of 35 thousand pesos, sold to River Plate the entire pass of Bernab√© Ferreyra, in what until then was \\"The most expensive pass for a player in the history of world football\\". It was until 1949, he is the player who stayed the longest as a record transfer in the history of football (17 years old). 1937: Juan Marvezzi (Tigre's all-time top scorer) arrived to the club. He would score 116 goals over 173 matches between 1937 and 1943. In October, 1944, the club receives the then vice president of the nation, colonel Juan Domingo Per√≥n. In front of a crowded stadium, the president of Tigre, Mario Piotti, designates the colonel, a confessed supporter of the club, as the honorary president of the entity of Victoria. 1945: Tigre won the Second Division championship. 1953: They won the tournament again, although by then it was known as Primera B.RSSSF 1953 1955: The team holds outstanding championship in First Division (finished 6th behind the big five and Lan√∫s). Tigre's striker was the top scorer of the second wheel, which caused that, in a note of the time written by the journalist Osvaldo Ardizzone for the magazine \\"El Gr√°fico\\", the group of Victoria was named for the first time as The Killer. 1956: Between January and March, Tigre made one of the best campaigns made by an Argentine team in America, where he faced teams, teams and selected teams. 1967: After finishing second in two occasions, he achieved promotion to the highest category again. 1971: Tigre was relegated to third category of Argentine football, where he spent 9 months, being the worst chapter in the club's history. 1979: Tigre returned to Primera Divisi√≥n, with Juan Carlos Lorenzo as the sports director. A curiosity of that year: while Tigre was on the rise, he sold more tickets than Racing Club, San Lorenzo and Independiente in First Division, and at the national level, he finished 4th only behind Boca Juniors, River Plate and Rosario Central. 1982: Tigre and San Lorenzo set the attendance record in the second division. More than 70,000 tickets are sold for the match that was played at the River Plate stadium. As of today and by different regulations of AFA, it will hardly be exceeded at any time. 1994: After many years, Tigre returned to be the center of attention of promotion tournaments, and as it happened every time, his convocation power extended much more than to the partisan media of the minor divisions. He is the champion of the first short tournament of the season. 2005: The team became two-time champion of the promotion with a record of points obtained in Argentine football. Fan of the Club Atl√©tico Tigre in 2006 2007: Tigre again returns to the First Division, and achieves the second position in his first tournament. The external factor to this campaign was the massive support, recognized by all: in almost all the matches of the tournament, Tigre sold out his popular tickets, both in Victoria and as a visitor. All this left the popular recognition in the football environment that Tigre had been widely the revelation of the tournament, and that Argentine football had recovered a great. 2008: For the 2008 Apertura, Tigre was one goal away from becoming champion, finally reaching the runner-up again. He finished with a total of 39 points, tied for first place along with San Lorenzo and Boca Juniors, but ends as runner-up after playing a historic triangular final. It must be considered that the AFA modified, in the midst of their dispute, the rules of this tournament. Originally it had established that in the event of a tie for first place, the champion would be decided according to the result of the game (s) between the teams occupying that place. Tigre defeated San Lorenzo and Boca Juniors, both as visitors, so it was appropriate to award him the title. However, with the imposed modification, the triangular had to be disputed. 2012: Again runner-up in the First Division. Tigre started the season thinking about the promotion table, but he ended up fighting the tournament until the last date. And at the end of that same year, after eliminating Millonarios FC in the semifinals for the 2012 Copa Sudamericana, he reached his first international final in its history. 2019: Is the most important year in the history of the team. A year to celebrate the feat of Mario Alberto Kempes. In which the football world of the world was amazed at the convening of a centennial neighborhood Club, which is capable of moving 20,000 people 700 km away, in the midst of an economic crisis, from a country without direction and at high prices. On June 2 he obtains his first official title from First Division by becoming champion of the Copa de la Superliga, after defeating Boca Juniors 2-0 with goals from Federico Gonzalez and Lucas Janson in the final played at the World Cup stadium Mario Alberto Kempes of C√≥rdoba. He thus achieves the right to dispute a new final for an official title against Racing Club for the Trophy of Champions 2019. Kit evolution In the chopped the first shirt that was used in it predominated an electric blue, pulling light blue, with a red collar and cuff. On the chest, embroidered in red, the original name of the club could be read: \\"Club Atl√©tico Juventud del Tigre\\". Between 1911 and 1919, the club began to alternate its titular shirt with a blue and red vertical striped one, varying the color and shape of the neck. With the affiliation to the dissident Amateurs de Football Association, in 1919, the regulation of the use of colors privileged San Lorenzo de Almagro in the use of design. This forced various changes, up to the one used to date.History shirt 2020-2021: { style=\\"width:20%;text-align:center;\\" align=left bg color=#ffffff   } Stadium Aerial view of the Colosseum stadium in Victoria Throughout its history, Club Atl√©tico Tigre had 3 courts, although the most popular is the current Jose Dellagiovanna Stadium. Is located in Victoria, Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1935 the land of Guido Spano was acquired and on December 29 the Foundation Stone was placed where the current Victoria stadium would be built. The land in front of the avenue was acquired with the certain possibility of expanding the number of supporters. Many internal struggles were generated by this determination. Former members, who did not understand at the time the perspective that this change offered to the club, deserted, definitively breaking their link with the institution. The president at that time was Le√≥n Bourdieu. It was inaugurated on September 20, 1936, in a friendly against Boca Juniors. It is on September 27, when the first game for the First Division championship organized by the AFA is played, facing Independiente de Avellaneda, with whom Tigre was defeated 1-0. On December 6, Tigre's first victory occurs in Victoria, defeating Ferro Carril Oeste 2-0.

It was written in 1879 and published unattributed in the New York Sun on May 4 of that year. It was reprinted in Stories by American Authors, Vol. 10. in 1884. It was later included in the modern collection The Crystal Man: Stories by Edward Page Mitchell, edited by Sam Moskowitz in 1973. Plot summary Dr. Fisher (not a MD) is spending his July holiday in Baden-Baden. While he is there, Baron Savitch, a rising Russian politician, is said to be ill by one of the hotel staff. Fisher is led into the baron's room where he finds the baron ill and shaking, and serves him some Bourbon, which makes things first better, then worse. Fisher notices that the baron's head is somewhat peculiar. The baron's head has a black silk skullcap which Fisher removes and finds the top of the baron's head to be a silver dome. The baron tells him to unscrew it but before he can, Dr. Rapperschwyll, the baron's doctor, comes in and tells Fisher to get out. There is a lot of controversy surrounding Savitch, mostly concerning his humble beginnings to his rise in the Tsar's court after graduating from the University of Dorpat. Wanting to know more, Fisher confronts Rapperschwyll at an old observation tower when the ladder falls and they find themselves trapped up there for hours. Rapperschwyll, after swearing Fisher to secrecy, tells him the story of Baron Savitch. Baron Savitch grew up in a mental asylum and was mute and retarded. Rapperschwyll found him there one day and, with his skill in medicine and watchmaking, made a clockwork brain for Savitch which is explicitly superior to Charles Babbage's difference engine. With this mechanical brain, Baron Savitch cannot make a mistake and with time will rise to become the next Napoleon. Later in Paris, Fisher finds Baron Savitch on a diplomatic mission. He learns Savitch will soon marry and is disgusted by the idea of a woman being married to a machine. He finds that Rapperschwyll has returned to his native Switzerland, visiting his dying mother. With this knowledge, Fisher waits for the baron to feel ill again after a second serving of Bourbon. Once that has happened Fisher comes to his aid as a doctor. With the baron's guard down, Fisher takes his brain, runs off with it and later throws it into the Atlantic Ocean on his return trip to America.

Eight deaths were recorded while damage reached $39.6 million (1977 USD). Seasonal summary The 1977 Pacific hurricane season was an inactive season, with the first cyclone forming on May 26 and the final system dissipating on October 23\\\\. Only eight named storms were documented throughout the year. Of those eight, four intensified into hurricanes, and none became major hurricanes, defined as Category 3 storms or stronger on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The number of tropical storms and major hurricanes stood solely as record lows until tied by 2010 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, the Accumulated Cyclone Energy index for the season was the lowest in recorded history. The low activity seen in the East Pacific was a common occurrence around the globe in 1977, with the fewest tropical cyclones worldwide, at 69, until 2010 recorded one fewer. May, June, July, and August all saw one named storm per month, with one hurricane each in the latter two months. September was more active with three named storms, of which one became a Category 2 hurricane. The season came to an end in October with one named storm which intensified into a hurricane. Despite the record low number of tropical storms, numerous short-lived tropical depressions existed throughout the eastern Pacific in 1977; like most of the other cyclones, however, these caused little or no impact to land.

It moved northwest and slowly organized, becoming a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on May 26 and further intensifying into Tropical Storm Ava approximately twelve hours later. The system remained over warm waters as it moved west and then north, allowing Ava to reach a peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) early on May 28\\\\. A series of subsequent reconnaissance aircraft missions documented an incomplete eye in association with the storm, although this organization soon began to fade amidst increasing wind shear and cooler ocean temperatures. Ava weakened to a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC on May 29 and dissipated less than 24 hours later. =Tropical Storm Bernice= A tropical disturbance was first identified early on June 25 well southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. It quickly organized into a tropical depression twelve hours later while moving west-northwest. After strengthening into Tropical Storm Bernice around 12:00 UTC on June 26, the cyclone was restricted from further development by the entrainment of low-level clouds from the north. Instead, Bernice transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on June 28\\\\. =Hurricane Claudia= A tropical disturbance, embedded within a larger area of convective activity, formed early on July 1 while well south of Acapulco, Mexico. On a westward heading, the disturbance coalesced into a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on June 3 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudia six hours later. Rapid development ensued thereafter as an eye became evident on satellite imagery, and Claudia attained its peak intensity as a strong Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) early on July 4\\\\. Progression over colder waters caused the system to weaken below hurricane strength by 00:00 UTC on July 5, coincident with the eye becoming obscured on satellite. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on July 7, and it ultimately dissipated six hours later. =Hurricane Doreen= A tropical disturbance first formed early on August 11. It drifted west and organized into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on August 13 before intensifying into Tropical Storm Doreen a little under a day later. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft was used to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) around 18:00 UTC on August 14; this constituted the storm's peak strength. Doreen turned north-northwest thereafter, briefly drifting onshore the coastline of Baja California near San Carlos as a minimal hurricane. It continued generally northwestward, weakening to a tropical storm around 06:00 UTC on August 16 before making a second landfall around Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur six hours later. Colder waters caused the system to fall to tropical depression intensity early on August 17 and dissipate around 00:00 UTC the next day while located just south of California. As Doreen moved parallel to the southwestern coastline of Mexico, it produced heavy rainfall there, with accumulations peaking at 14.80 inches (375.9 mm) near the Los Cabos Municipality. Farther northwest, Mexicali, Baja California was particularly hard-hit, with more than 2,000 people left homeless after their shanty-style homes were demolished by the rain. Despite dissipating as a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Doreen continued into the Southwest United States, resulting in maximum rainfall accumulations of 7.45 inches (189 mm) in the San Jacinto Mountains of California. Approximately 325 homes and businesses throughout the desert Southwest were destroyed, and several roads were covered or washed out by floodwater across California and Arizona. Throughout San Diego, California and nearby Imperial County, the storm accrued $25 million in crop damage. Extensive damage to streets, washes, levees, and dikes occurred throughout the Mohave Valley, particularly in Bullhead City, Arizona, where more than 50 people were evacuated and over 12 homes and businesses were heavily damaged. Strong thunderstorms, with winds reaching up to 60 mph (95 km/h), downed trees and caused intermittent power outages in Palm Springs, California. Farther east in Las Vegas, Nevada, meanwhile, less than 2 inches (51 mm) of rain flooded major intersections and caused roofs to collapse. Throughout the region, eight people were reported dead. =Tropical Depression Eleven (Anita)= On August 29, a tropical depression formed over the Gulf of Mexico and tracked slowly west. It quickly strengthened, reaching hurricane strength within 30 hours of formation. It eventually achieved Category 5 status before striking northern Mexico on September 2\\\\. The mountainous terrain of Mexico nearly caused Anita to dissipate; however, its circulation survived the crossing and emerged over the Pacific on September 3 as a tropical depression. The system featured a 300 miles (485 km) wide area of convection and traveled west in response to a ridge over Baja California. The depression traversed Islas Mar√≠as and soon moved over cooler waters, prompting weakening. Lacking thermal support, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on September 3 off the southern tip of Baja California Sur. =Tropical Storm Emily= Emily first began as a disturbance early on September 12. It moved west-northwest and developed into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on September 13\\\\. Surface observations from nearby ships were used to upgrade the depression to a tropical storm twelve hours later. Despite persistent, deep convective activity, a trek over colder waters prevented Emily from further intensifying, and the system instead transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC on September 14\\\\. =Hurricane Florence= The strongest cyclone of the 1977 season began as a tropical disturbance over the open eastern Pacific. It developed into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on September 20 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence twelve hours later. The newly-formed system moved west-northwest until reaching hurricane strength by 00:00 UTC on September 22, at which point Florence sharply curved toward the north- northeast. With a well-defined eye on satellite imagery, the storm reached peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) around 18:00 UTC on September 22, a Category 2 hurricane. Florence accelerated over increasingly cool ocean temperatures, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm early on September 23, weaken to a tropical depression early on September 24, and transition to an extratropical cyclone by 12:00 UTC that day. =Tropical Storm Glenda= Tropical Storm Glenda formed around 00:00 UTC on September 24 from a previously established area of disturbed weather well southwest of Acapulco. The storm did not intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength and instead fell to tropical depression strength around 00:00 UTC on September 25\\\\. A north to northwestward forward motion brought the cyclone over progressively cooler waters, and it transitioned to an extratropical cyclone by 06:00 UTC on September 27 while located near Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur. =Hurricane Heather= The final named storm of the season began as a tropical disturbance late on October 3\\\\. It moved west-northwest, organizing into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on October 4 and further intensifying into Tropical Storm Heather six hours thereafter. A sprawling storm, Heather reached hurricane strength early on October 5 and attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) by 12:00 UTC that day. A turn toward the north- northwest, however, brought the storm over increasingly cool waters, prompting a weakening trend. Heather fell to tropical storm strength late on October 6 and further to a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC as its low- and mid-level circulations became dislocated, marking an end to its time as a tropical cyclone. The remnants continued into Arizona, where measurable rainfall peaked at 8.30 in (211 mm), with unspecified reports of up to 14 inches (356 mm) in mountainous locales. As a result, the Santa Cruz River near Tucson witnessed its highest discharge since at least 1892, and the San Pedo River saw its sixth-highest crest since 1913. At least 16,000 acres (6,500 hectares) of farmland were inundated, and about 90 homes were damaged mainly near Nogales, Arizona, though some property damage occurred throughout Amado, Green Valley, and Sahuarita as well. In addition, about 175 families were evacuated from Nogales; in the aftermath of the rains, residents were asked to conserve water after the city's wells were inundated with mud and rendered unusable. Two bridges were destroyed while an additional twelve to fifteen were damaged, in addition to telephone lines and other utilities. Damage equated to about $14.6 million. =Other systems= Despite the season featuring the lowest number of tropical storms on record at the time, there were numerous tropical depressions that failed to intensify into named storms. The first two tropical depressions existed from May 25‚Äì30 and from May 30‚ÄìJune 1, both west of the Honduras‚ÄìNicaragua border. Tropical depressions Six and Seven occurred in quick succession from July 8‚Äì9 and July 9‚Äì10, respectively. Tropical Depression Eight occurred solely on July 25, while Tropical Depression Nine existed from August 1‚Äì2. Yet another cyclone existed from September 3‚Äì4, while the seventeenth and final unnamed system formed on October 22 and dissipated on the next day. Storm names The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the Eastern North Pacific in 1977. This is the same list used in the 1973 season. This is also the final year that this list was used, as the practice of using all-female names for tropical cyclones was replaced with a mixture of male and female names beginning in 1978. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Ava * Bernice * Claudia * Doreen * Emily * Florence * Glenda  * Heather      * } See also *List of Pacific hurricanes *Pacific hurricane season *1977 Atlantic hurricane season *1977 Pacific typhoon season *1977 North Indian Ocean cyclone season *Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons: 1976‚Äì77, 1977‚Äì78 *Timeline of the 1977 Pacific hurricane season References External links * Central Pacific Hurricane Center archive Category:Pacific hurricane seasons Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines ","title":"1977 Pacific hurricane season"},{"id":"2431346","text":"right The Bridgend Designer Outlet, also known as McArthurGlen Designer Outlet (and known locally as \\"The Pines\\") is a commercial retail park and outlet store development in Bridgend, Wales, United Kingdom.

There are currently four major archbishops each leading a major archiepiscopal autonomous Church. History There was a strong movement within and after the Second Vatican Council to elevate Josyf Slipyj, then metropolitan of Lviv, for the Ukrainians, to the status of patriarch. Many of his admirers use this title for Slipyj when referring to him historically and many in Ukraine use this title for the current major archbishop even today. However, Pope Paul VI specifically declined to grant this title, instead creating this new title and appointing Slipyj the first \\"major archbishop\\" of Lviv (the seat has since been moved to Kiev). Slipyj's successors have only used the title of major archbishop. The title \\"major archbishop\\" was first granted to the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in 1963. The Syro- Malabar Church became major archiepiscopal in 1992, followed by the Syro- Malankara Catholic Church and the Romanian Greek Catholic Church in 2005. Comparison to other titles Compared to other titles available to the heads of sui juris Eastern Catholic Churches, the title of \\"major archbishop\\" falls below \\"patriarch\\" and above \\"metropolitan archbishop\\". The title is used for archbishops of episcopal sees that were founded more recently than the patriarchal sees and are therefore less prestigious. Canon law generally treats major archbishops as equivalent to patriarchs, except where specifically provided otherwise.1990 Code of Canons for the Oriental Churches, Canon 152 What differences there are between the two offices are mainly differences of ceremony or honor. Major archbishops rank immediately below patriarchs in the order of precedence of the Catholic Church.1990 Code of Canons for the Oriental Churches, Canon 154 If made members of the College of Cardinals, major archbishops join the order of Cardinal-Priests, whereas Eastern Catholic patriarchs join the highest order as Cardinal-Bishops. Like patriarchs, major archbishops are elected by the synod of the sui iuris Church, but their election requires confirmation by the Pope, not the simple notification and request for communion required of patriarchs.1990 Code of Canons for the Oriental Churches, Canon 153; cf. Canon 63 and Canon 76 On the other hand, metropolitan archbishops of Eastern Catholic Churches sui juris are appointed by the Pope (rather than elected by their synod) and have much less authority even within their own churches.1990 Code of Canons for the Oriental Churches, Canon 155 The title major archbishop in the Catholic Church is roughly equivalent to the patriarchal title catholicos in some Orthodox Churches. Catholicos is used internally by the Syro-Malankara Church for their major archbishop.\\"Syro Malankara Church says it can use Catholicos title\\" , Indian Catholic News Service, July 21, 2005 List of Major Archbishops This section provides a complete list of every bishop who has held the title of major archbishop, organized according to the precedence of their titles, which follows the order in which their churches became major archiepiscopal.1990 Code of Canons for the Oriental Churches, Canon 154 So far, every major archbishop has been a cardinal except for Cyril Baselios and Sviatoslav Shevchuk.

He excavated hill Hisarlik that is known as Troy situated in modern-day Turkey. He continued his research in Turkey, excavating from 1982 to 1987 at Besik Bay, a few kilometres from the famous site of Hisarlik (the supposed location of Homer's Troy). In 1988 the Turkish government gave him an exclusive excavation license for Troy itself (which for academic purposes is internationally known as Troia, at his suggestion). Over many years, his team excavated large sections of the lower part of Troy, beneath the later Roman- era ruins. During the excavation campaign and under the direction of Korfmann, altogether 13,240 square meters of land were excavated by 370 archaeologists. Since Schliemann's work of Troy, there has been much dispute over its cultural and historical interpretation. While many ancient historians doubt the significance of the lower part of the settlement, Korfmann presented his argument that the bronze-age city at Hisarlik was quite large, and had played a key role in trade around the Dardanelles. Also, due to his initiative, in 2001, a major Troy exhibition was displayed in Stuttgart, \\"Troy - dream and reality\\".https://archive.archaeology.org/0107/abstracts/museum.html About 800,000 visitors visited this exhibition, but the way it presented the excavation findings, initially without proper labeling of reconstructions which were purely speculative, turned the scientific debate into a bitter controversy. In February 2002 in T√ºbingen, Korfmann presented the arguments for his conclusions over the decades of past scientific works in Troy. The main point of the controversy was the real size and interpretation of the bronze-age city; further excavation in August 2003 supported Korfmann's theory, and he announced that \\"Troy was much larger than so far accepted, which I can prove by my excavations\\". The diggings in the plains south of the hill and magneto-metric investigations told that Troy was 15 times larger than previously expected. Outside a moat was cut down into the bedrock measuring a width of 4 meters and a depth of 2. Owing to Korfmann, the interest in Troy rose enormously, for his excavations again rekindled enthusiasm for the myths about Troy. In 1996 he helped to establish a national park around the Troy site and two years later UNESCO declared this site as World Cultural Heritage; many tourists come to see the excavation site. Professor Korfmann had accepted in 2004 the Turkish nationality given to him by the government of Turkey for his contribution to that country; he also took Osman as his middle name, acknowledging years of being known by the nickname of \\"Osman Bey\\". Apart from excavations in Troy, he also turned to excavation in other places around the Black Sea, notably Didigora and Udabno in Georgia. Manfred Korfmann died of lung cancerhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-manfred- korfmann-8699259.html on August 11, 2005, at the age of 63 in his home in Ofterdingen near T√ºbingen. He hoped that the excavations would continue and that the Turkish government would build a world-class museum near the site. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter.

The females of most species are brightly colored with six prominent spines on their broad, hardened, shell-like abdomens. The name Gasteracantha is derived from the Greek (), meaning \\"belly, abdomen\\", and (), meaning \\"thorn, spine\\". Spiny-backed orb-weavers are sometimes colloquially called \\"crab spiders\\" because of their shape, but they are not closely related to the true crab spiders. Other colloquial names for certain species include thorn spider, star spider, kite spider, or jewel spider. Members of the genus exhibit strong sexual dimorphism. Males are several times smaller than females, and they lack prominent spines or bright colors. Gasteracantha is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical climates. The genus is most diverse in tropical Asia, from India through Indonesia. One species, G. cancriformis, occurs in the Americas. Gasteracantha species are related to spine-bearing orb-weavers in several other genera (see Taxonomy and Systematics). Orb-weavers' bites are generally harmless to humans. Taxonomy and systematics Gasteracantha has a complex taxonomic history, and many questions of species limits and distribution and generic interrelationships remain unanswered. Challenges include the variability within individual Gasteracantha species (e.g., color polymorphism and variable length and shape of spines), a lack of male specimens and descriptions for many species, missing or damaged type specimens, and ambiguous initial descriptions in 18th- and 19th-century scientific literature. The 70 species currently recognized by World Spider Catalog include dozens of synonyms and subspecies, many based on literature well over 100 years old. Gasteracantha is related to several other spiny orb-weaver genera of Africa, Asia, and Australasia, many of which are monospecific: * Acrosomoides ‚Äì 3 spp., Africa * Actinacantha ‚Äì Actinacantha globulata, Indonesia * Aetrocantha ‚Äì Aetrocantha falkensteini, central Africa * Afracantha ‚Äì Afracantha camerunensi, Africa * Augusta ‚Äì Augusta glyphica, Madagascar * Austracantha ‚Äì Austracantha minax, Australia * Friula ‚Äì Friula wallacei, Borneo * Gastroxya ‚Äì 4 spp., Africa * Hypsacantha ‚Äì Hypsacantha crucimaculata, Africa * Isoxya ‚Äì 16 spp., Africa, Madagascar, and Yemen * Macracantha ‚Äì 1 or 2 spp., Asia * Madacantha ‚Äì Madacantha nossibeana, Madagascar * Parmatergus ‚Äì 3 spp., Madagascar * Thelacantha ‚Äì Thelacantha brevispina, Australia, Asia, Madagascar * Togacantha ‚Äì Togacantha nordviei, Africa A 2019 study examining three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes found that Gasteracantha is paraphyletic with respect to Macracantha, Actinacantha, and Thelacantha. M. arcuata is allied with G. hasselti and A. globulata, while T. brevispina is closer to G. kuhli and G. diardi. The authors, however, did not propose generic reassignments based on their findings. Micrathena orb- weavers in North and South America also have hardened abdomens with variously shaped spines, but they are not closely related to Gasteracantha within the orb-weaver family.

College career Alvin Williams went to Villanova as one of the most highly touted recruits sounding a charge led by head coach Steve Lappas to restart bringing homegrown talent from Philadelphia to the Wildcats, which had been dormant for years under head coach Rollie Massimino. During his senior season, Williams led Villanova in scoring and assists with 17 points and 4.5 assists per game. Along with Tim Thomas, Williams would take Villanova to a regular season Big East title and a berth in the 1997 NCAA Tournament where they lost in the Second round to California featuring future NFL All-Pro Tony Gonzalez. Professional career =Toronto Raptors= After being drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round of the 1997 NBA draft, Williams was traded to the Toronto Raptors in February 1998. Williams worked his way into the Raptors' rotation under head coach Butch Carter, but greatly improved as the starting point guard under head coach Lenny Wilkens in 2001. He started all 82 games for two straight seasons in 2001‚Äì02 and 2002‚Äì03. During the 2002‚Äì03 season, which was his best statistical season as a professional, Williams averaged 13.2 points and 5.3 assists per game. After missing a third of the 2003‚Äì04 and the entire 2004‚Äì05 season with a knee injury, Williams rejoined the lineup at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season. Unfortunately, the injured knee forced Williams back on the injured list after playing just one game that season. On July 26, 2006, Williams was waived by the Raptors to make room for free agent guard Fred Jones. Reports said both the team and Williams had reached an agreement that resulted in the Raptors only having to pay half of Williams' remaining salary. =Los Angeles Clippers= On January 20, 2007, Williams signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. He was not signed to a second contract after the first expired after appearing in two games in limited action. Post-playing career On July 1, 2009, the Raptors announced the hiring of Williams as an assistant coach for the team. This would mark the return of Williams to the organization since being waived by the team less than three years earlier. On September 24, 2010, the Raptors announced that Williams would become the team's Director of Player Development. In June 2013 he was let go from his position with the Raptors. Since 2015 Williams has been an NBA Analyst with Rogers Sportsnet.

It was one of four RCAF wings, consisting of three fighter squadrons each, established in Europe in the early 1950s at the beginning of the Cold War. The other three wings were located at RCAF Station Marville (1 Wing) in France, and RCAF Station Zweibr√ºcken (3 Wing) and RCAF Station Baden-Soellingen (4 Wing) in the former West Germany. These wings were components of the RCAF's No. 1 Air Division, part of the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4 ATAF). They functioned as Canada's western European air defence commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). History =1952‚Äì1964= No. 2 Wing's three squadrons flew from Canada between September 28 and October 11, 1952 during Operation Leapfrog II. They were the first of the Canadian Air Division squadrons to arrive in mainland Europe, and the first RCAF squadrons to be based on the European mainland since March 1946.Roberts 1959, p. 245. RCAF Sky Lancers aerobatic team, 1955 All twelve Air Division squadrons flew the Canadair Sabre day fighter. The squadrons originally based at Grostenquin were 416, 421 and 430. Beginning in 1956 four all-weather CF-100 squadrons entered service with Air Division. One squadron in each wing was replaced by a CF-100 squadron. No. 416 Squadron was replaced by 423 Squadron at 2 Wing. In 1959 Canada adopted a controversial nuclear strike role in accordance with NATO's doctrine of \\"limited nuclear warfare\\" and began re-equipping with the new CF-104 Starfighter that could deliver nuclear weapons. This aircraft also had a reconnaissance role. In the fall of 1962 the Sabre squadrons of the Air Division, including 421 and 430 Squadrons at 2 Wing, were re-equipped with the Starfighter. Concurrently, CF-100s ceased operation in the Air Division and 423 Squadron was disbanded.Milberry 1984, p.335-339Greenhous 1999, p.132-133. Sabres of No. 421 Squadron at Grostenquin, 1957 Pilots from all three Sabre squadrons at 2 Wing flew with 2 Wing's aerobatic team, the Sky Lancers. The team was formed in March 1955 and performed throughout Europe until October 1955. The following year the team was based at 4 Wing.Milberry 1984, p.359.

Other families were accommodated in private homes in local villages or in trailers on the base. Some personnel resided in single quarters on the station. Schools were located at Saint Avold and on the station. Recreational facilities on the base included an arena and pool. A grocery and general store, as well as a hospital were also located on the station. Veterans Affairs Canada, Location Details Retrieved 2016-08-15 NATO bases in France, including Grostenquin, were short-lived. In 1963 the Government of France announced that all nuclear weapons in France were to be placed under French control. This was unacceptable to the Canadian Government (and to other NATO governments with forces stationed in France), so the two nuclear strike squadrons of 2 Wing (421 and 430 Squadrons) were hastily relocated; 430 Squadron moved to 3 Wing Zweibr√ºcken and 421 Squadron moved to 4 Wing Baden-Soellingen. RCAF Station Grostenquin closed in 1964.Milberry 1984, p.354. =Post-RCAF= After 1964 the airfield was transferred to the French Armed Forces, but abandoned until 1979 when it was re-used as an electronic warfare training range (POLYGON) by the French Air Force, French Army Aviation Corps, Luftwaffe and USAF. Other than the hangars most of the RCAF logistics facilities are gone. The runway, taxiways and tarmac remain visible from aerial photos (as late as 2010) but markings have changed since the RCAF left in 1964.

There are several schemes which are most commonly used, though there are no hard and fast rules and alternate or modified schemes are sometimes used as is suitable to the event. Reserved seating In a purely reserved seating (also known as allocated seating or assigned seating) scheme, each ticket is assigned a specific seat in the venue at the time of purchase. Seats are typically identified by row number/letter, seat number, and sometimes by section. Reserved seating is the most common scheme used for large indoor venues such as stadia, arenas, and larger theatres. It is also common at other venues, as are other seating schemes, such as outdoor amphitheatres. General admission In a general admission (also known as open seating or free seating) scheme, each spectator has a ticket. However, the location from which they will watch the event is determined upon arrival at the venue. General admission is most commonly employed in seat-less venues, such as outdoor festival shows and smaller club shows. It is also sometimes used in seat-less sections of events that would otherwise have reserved seating (standing-room only sections, including the floor section(s) at some concerts). In some general admission events, a ticket may still assign the holder a specific section of the venue (e.g., balcony or floor), with the choice of seat within that section. General admission can also refer to a scheme in which seating is available; however, it is not pre- assigned. Typically in this scheme, seat selection is on a first-come, first- served basis. A common example of this scheme is most movie theatres in the United States. General admission events may be ticketed with no assigned seat number, or it may be purely first-come, first-served, in which the first certain number of people in line are admitted (either as a free event, or paying at the door/gate). Due to the first-come, first-served nature of the seating selection, line-ups may still form for pre-ticketed events. =Festival seating= Festival seating typically refers to the form of general admission (first-come, first-served) in which there is a large open area (generally outdoors) and all spectators must stand (unless they are permitted to bring their own portable seating). Many music acts use festival seating because it allows the most enthusiastic fans to get near the stage and generate excitement for the rest of the crowd. Some performers and bands insist on a festival seating area near the stage. On December 3, 1979, the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati, Ohio, was the site of one of the worst rock concert tragedies in United States history. Eleven fans were killed and several dozen others injured in the rush for seating at the opening of a sold- out concert by The Who. The concert was using festival seating. When the crowds waiting outside heard the band performing a soundcheck, they thought the concert was beginning and rammed the still-closed doors, trampling those at the front of the crowd. The tragedy was blamed on poor crowd control, mainly the failure of arena management to open enough doors to deal with the crowd outside. As a result, concert venues across North America switched to assigned seating or changed their rules about festival seating. Cincinnati immediately outlawed festival seating at concerts, although it overturned the ban on August 4, 2004, since the ban was making it difficult for Cincinnati to book concerts. (In 2002, the city had made a one-time exception to the ban, allowing festival seating for a Bruce Springsteen concert; no problems were experienced.) Cincinnati was the only city in the U.S. to outlaw festival seating altogether. =Lawn seating= \\"Lawn seating\\" refers to a seating method where concert-goers sit on the grass in the rear of the venue. Attendees can sometimes bring their own chairs, or rent them from vendors at the concert.

Karzers existed both at universities and at gymnasiums (similar to a grammar school) in Germany until the beginning of the 20th century. Marburg's last Karzer inmate, for example, was registered as late as 1931. Responsible for the administration of the Karzer was the so-called Pedell (English: bedel), or during later times Karzerw√§rter (a warden). While Karzer arrest was originally a severe punishment, the respect for this punishment diminished with time, particularly in the 19th century, as it became a matter of honour to have been incarcerated at least once during one's time at university. At the end of the 19th century, as the students in the cell became responsible for their own food and drink and the receiving of visitors became permitted, the \\"punishment\\" would often turn into a social occasion with excessive consumption of alcohol. Karzers have been preserved at the universities of Heidelberg, Jena, Marburg, Freiburg, T√ºbingen, Freiberg (School of Mines), Greifswald, G√∂ttingen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg in Erlangen, and at Tartu, Estonia. The Karzer in G√∂ttingen was known, after the Pedell Br√ºhbach, as Hotel de Br√ºhbach; it was moved in the 19th century, because of the extension of the university library, to the Aula building; a cell door, preserved from the old Karzer, shows graffiti by Otto von Bismarck. Bearing witness to how the students spent the time in the cell are the many memorable wall, table and door graffiti left by students in the cells and today shown as tourist attractions in the older German universities.

It has marked similarities to asset-protection trusts found in several offshore jurisdictions and US Spendthrift trusts. In such a trust assets are ordinarily held to pay an income to the beneficiary. The beneficiary may also have access to capital of the trust with the trustee's permission. The right to receive income from a trust would ordinarily be an asset in the hands of the beneficiary and could be sold, thwarting the intention of the donor to spread the gift over the recipient's lifetime. Additionally on a bankruptcy the right to the income would be sold by the beneficiary's trustee in bankruptcy. To give protection to beneficiaries, a protective trust automatically converts into a discretionary trust, under which the beneficiary has no right to the income, if he or she does anything which breaches a condition specified in the document creating the trust. The establishment of this discretionary trust is ordinarily exempt from the charge to UK inheritance tax on the establishment of discretionary trusts. Such protective trusts have a longstanding history. To reduce the verbose definitions that had previously to be recited in the establishing documents of a protective trust, in England and Wales s33 of the Trustee Act 1925 (and equivalent legislation in other jurisdictions) provides that this protection will arise in any trust described as a \\"protective trust\\" in its trust deed. Protective trusts are subject to challenge under creditor protection legislation as are any other forms of asset-protection. However many jurisdictions do not permit a trust to be broken where a debtor who remains a discretionary beneficiary only under a trust and cannot access the fund without the exercise of the trustees' discretion in his favour.

The twelfth tropical cyclone and the eighth hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season, Alice developed on December 30, 1954 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. After passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500 (1955 USD). There was an earlier hurricane named Alice in the season. Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2. It received the name Alice in early 1955, though re-analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season. Meteorological history A cold front moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong anticyclone developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward from the cold front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 ¬∞C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 30 while located 770 miles (1245 km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles, though operationally, the system was believed to have become a tropical depression on December 31. With a narrow ridge of high pressure to its north, the depression moved west-southwestward. Atmospheric conditions were unusually favorable for the time of the year due to the ridge of high pressure preventing cold air from reaching the central Atlantic Ocean. This allowed the depression to intensify into a tropical storm later on December 30, based on direct observations. There were few direct observations for the following days, but it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on December 31 while located about 475 miles (770 km) east-northeast of Barbuda. On January 1, 1955, a ship within 10 miles (16 km) of the center reported hurricane-force winds and a pressure of 987 mbar. Based on this report and several other ship reports, the system was recognized as a tropical low by the San Juan Weather Bureau Office. The hurricane continued to the southwest, and entered the Caribbean Sea on January 2 after passing between Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy. A portion of the eyewall moved over Saint Martin and Saba. Based on near-hurricane-force winds from the affected islands, an information bulletin named the system as Hurricane Alice while in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Throughout its track, Alice was a small tropical cyclone with a diameter of only around 60 miles (95 km). Reconnaissance aircraft flew into Hurricane Alice on January 3 and confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone by reporting winds between 60 and 65 mph (95 to 105 km/h) and a warm core center. It is estimated Alice continued to intensify as it tracked southwestward in the Caribbean Sea, and attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) while located about 95 miles (150 km) west-northwest of Montserrat. While near its peak the hurricane developed a ring of convection around its eye, and Alice maintained peak winds for about 24 hours until cold air from the north weakened it. Extratropical cyclogenesis occurred north of Bermuda on January 3, which weakened the high pressure system to the north of Alice and turned the flow in the Caribbean Sea to that of cold northwesterly winds. Alice turned to the southeast on January 4 and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Convection gradually became disorganized, and after weakening to a tropical depression on January 5, Alice dissipated on January 6 while located about 100 miles (160 km) west-northwest of Grenada. Impact, naming and records Surface weather analysis of Hurricane Alice on January 3, 1955 Subsequent to the confirmation of the existence of Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico warned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas. Hurricane Alice produced moderate to strong winds across the islands, peaking at 81 mph (130 km/h) in Saint Barth√©lemy and 75 mph (120 km/h) in Saba. The hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands, including a peak of 11.27 inches (286 mm) in 48 hours recorded at Saba. Due to its small size, only a few islands received significant effects from the hurricane. Saint- Barth√©lemy, Saba, Anguilla, Sint Eustatius, and Saint Kitts reported damage from the hurricane, totaling $623,500 (1955 USD, $4.7 million 2006 USD). Damage was heaviest on Saba and Anguilla, occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops. 626 houses were destroyed or severely damaged on Anguilla, as well. The damage was caused mostly by heavy rainfall and rough seas, not the direct action of the wind. The passage of Hurricane Alice greatly troubled the economies of the small affected islands. Additionally, the outer rainbands of the storm alleviated dry conditions on Puerto Rico which had persisted since the previous October. No deaths were reported. This storm formed on December 30; however, in the days before satellites, meteorologists had to rely on reports from ships and islands in the Atlantic to locate and track storms. This information was often sketchy; two cyclones, including a Category 2 hurricane, operationally went undetected in 1954. It was officially recognized as a significant tropical cyclone on January 2, 1955. At the time, the National Weather Service used the same naming list each year, so the name given to this storm was \\"Alice\\" and it was designated as a part of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season. However, it was found during post- storm analysis that the storm had actually formed on December 30, and was instead a part of the 1954 season. Therefore, the season had two storms named \\"Alice\\" ‚Äî the first storm of the season, and the last. Had Alice been discovered before the end of the calendar year, it would have been named Irene, the next name on the 1954 list. Some reports named this storm Alice2 to avoid confusion with the earlier Alice from June 1954. Alice formed later in the calendar year than any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours later in the season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of only eight Atlantic tropical cyclones to form in the month of December. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in the month of January and the strongest to do so.

McMenamin has won three All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals, two Ulster Championships and two National League titles with the county. Forging a reputation for being a bit of a bad boy during his career, he was awarded an All Star for his performances in 2005. McMenamin plays his club football for St. Dympna's Dromore and has won two Tyrone Senior Football Championships with the club. Despite normally starting at corner back for his county, he is not a traditional corner back, often running with the ball up the pitch, and getting himself into scoring positions. However, his marking is among the best in the country, and often marks the opposition's leading scorers. He also plays at centre half back for his club. Playing career =Inter-county= In 2003 McMenamin helped Tyrone win the county's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Two years later he won a second All-Ireland medal with Tyrone, and received an All Star award for his performances that year. In 2006, he captained the much-depleted side due to injury to the captain, Brian Dooher. The side were knocked out of the Championship by Laois in July. In 2008, he won a third All-Ireland with Tyrone. In the winter of 2012, McMenamin retired from Inter-county football and is no longer with the Tyrone senior setup. =Club= McMenamin helped Dromore win the Tyrone Senior Football Championship in 2007, beating Coalisland in the final. Dromore also reached the following year's final, but were defeated by Clonoe. In 2009 he once again helped Dromore win the Tyrone Senior Football Championship in dramatic style against Ardboe =International rules= McMenamin has represented Ireland in the International Rules Series. Disciplinary problems Discipline has been an underlying problem in McMenamin's career, which at times threatened to overshadow his achievements. This indiscipline has been apparent throughout his career, and he has made a name for his verbal taunting of his direct opponents during matches as well, which was mentioned by Oisin McConville in his autobiography. His 2005 achievements were blotted somewhat by his disciplinary record. He was given a yellow card late on in the replayed Ulster Championship, for dropping his knee onto a fallen player. This was upgraded to a sending off after the game, which meant that McMenamin would be suspended for the following four weeks, but Tyrone launched an appeal, employing the services of former player, and practising solicitor, Fergal Logan. The appeal was successful but only after McMenamin missed the All-Ireland qualifier against Monaghan. In the opening game of the 2007 Ulster Senior Football Championship, despite being one of the few first choice panellists available on the injury-hit side, he was substituted just before half time because he had already picked up a yellow card and a ticking‚Äîmeaning he was one bad tackle away from being sent off. He was visibly upset when he was shown coming off the field. As a result of his behaviour in a league match against Kerry on Sunday 15 February, where he was seen to grab Paul Galvin in the groin area, he was banned for eight weeks. Initially the ban was for six weeks, but due to the nature of McMenamin's behaviour the ban was raised to eight weeks, when the Tyrone County Board appealed the initial six-week ban. In addition to the incident with Paul Galvin for which he received the ban, McMenamim was involved in a number of unsavoury incidents throughout the match, which led to intense criticism in the media.

The most significant of the Ugandan parliament's functions is to pass laws which will provide good governance in the country. The government ministers are bound to answer to the people's representatives on the floor of the house. Through the various parliamentary committees, parliament scrutinises government programmes, particularly as outlined in the State of the Nation address by the president. The fiscal issues of the government, such as taxation and loans need the sanction of the parliament, after appropriate debate. Composition The Ugandan parliament is composed of 238 constituency representatives, 112 district woman representatives, ten Uganda People's Defence Force representatives, five representatives of the youth, five representatives of persons with disabilities, five representatives of workers, and thirteen ex officio members. History The Ugandan parliament was established in 1962, soon after the country's independence. =First Parliament (1962‚Äì1963)= This body was then known as the National Assembly. It had 92 members and was presided over, as speaker, by Sir John Bowes Griffin, a British lawyer and former Ugandan Chief Justice. =Second Parliament (1963‚Äì1971)= During this period, Prime Minister Milton Obote abrogated the constitution and declared himself President of Uganda in 1966. This parliament also witnessed the abolition of Uganda's traditional kingdoms and the declaration of Uganda as a republic. The speaker during the Second Parliament was Narendra M. Patel, a Ugandan of Indian descent. This parliament ended when Idi Amin overthrew Milton Obote's government in January 1971. =Third Parliament (1979‚Äì1980)= Following the overthrow of Idi Amin in April 1979, a new legislative body known as the Uganda Legislative Council was established. With an initial membership of 30, the membership was later increased to 120. This was the Third Parliament and was chaired by Professor Edward Rugumayo. This legislative body continued to function until the general elections of December 1980. =Fourth Parliament (1980‚Äì1985)= This period marked the return to power of Milton Obote and the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), following the disputed national elections of 1980. The speaker of the Fourth Parliament was Francis Butagira, a Harvard-trained lawyer. the Fourth Parliament ended when General Bazillio Okello overthrew Obote and the UPC government in 1985. =Fifth Parliament (1986‚Äì1996)= Known as the National Resistance Council (NRC), the Fifth Parliament was established following the end of the Ugandan 1981-1985 guerrilla war. Starting with 38 historical members of the National Resistance Movement and National Resistance Army, the legislative body was gradually expanded to include representatives from around the country. The speaker during the Fifth Parliament was Yoweri Museveni, who also concurrently served as the President of Uganda. =Sixth Parliament (1996‚Äì2001)= The Sixth Parliament was constituted during one-party rule (NRM). James Wapakhabulo served as speaker from 1996 until 1998. From 1998 until 2001, Francis Ayume, a member of Parliament from Koboko District, served as speaker. =Seventh Parliament (2001‚Äì2006)= The Seventh Parliament was presided over as Speaker by Edward Ssekandi. The most controversial legislation passed during this period was the amendment of the constitution to remove presidential term limits. =Eighth Parliament (2006‚Äì2011)= This was a continuation of the Seventh Parliament, with Edward Ssekandi as speaker and Rebecca Kadaga as deputy speaker. =Ninth Parliament (2011‚Äì2016)= The Ninth Parliament was presided over by Rebecca Kadaga as speaker, and Jacob Oulanyah as deputy speaker. =Tenth Parliament (2016‚Äìpresent)= In the Tenth Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga and Jacob Oulanyah remained in their posts as speaker and deputy speaker respectively. 2017 Parliament fight On September 27, 2017, a fight ensued during a legislative session of the Ugandan parliament. The legislation in discussion at the time was to remove the presidential age limit of 75 from the Ugandan constitution. Following accusations from the parliamentary speaker against certain lawmakers in the chamber of disorderly conduct, a full-fledged fight broke out in which chairs were thrown, microphone stands used as clubs, and eventual removal of some members by plain clothes security officers.

C.. He is the host of The Kojo Nnamdi Show and The Politics Hour on WAMU, and hosted the Evening Exchange broadcast on WHUT-TV from 1985 to 2011. Early life Nnamdi was born Rex Orville Montague Paul in British Guiana on January 8, 1945. As a high school student, Nnamdi and his friends opposed British colonialism, at odds with their parents. In 1967, a year after Guyana became independent from British rule, Nnamdi moved to Montreal, Canada to attend McGill University after his mother secretly saved his earnings from selling insurance and filled out an application on his behalf. While attending McGill, Nnamdi became interested in the Black Power movement. After a year at McGill, Nnamdi moved to the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the U.S., where he worked on Wall Street and joined the Black Panther Party. However not long after joining the Panthers Nnamdi drifted out of the Party. Nnamdi had been seeking a Black Nationalist and Pan-Africanism supporting organisation, whereas by this time the Black Panthers had embraced internationalism and were committed to working with people of all races towards a socialist America. It would not be until later in life that Nnamdi would embrace Marxist theory as the Panthers had. Nnamdi moved to Washington, D. C. in 1969 and enrolled in Federal City College, now the University of the District of Columbia. While attending the college, Nnamdi joined former members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to form the Center for Black Education. Broadcasting career =Early radio career (1969‚Äì1985)= Nnamdi began his radio career in 1969 as an actor and director for children's plays that aired Sundays on Washington rhythm and blues radio station WOL. With the on-air name \\"Brother Uwezo\\", Nnamdi became editor for Sauti, a news magazine program on WOL, in 1970. After marrying in 1971, he adopted the on-air name that he would use for the rest of his career, Kojo Nnamdi. He described it as an \\"African Christian name and surname that made more sense\\", first name \\"Kojo\\" being an Akan name for \\"Monday\\" and surname \\"Nnamdi\\" after the first President of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe. In 1973, Nnamdi became news editor at WHUR, the radio station of Howard University, a historically black university in Washington. Later becoming news director, Nnamdi helped produce The Daily Drum, a local news program. =Evening Exchange (1985‚Äì2011)= Nnamdi left WHUR in 1985 to join Howard television station WHMM (later WHUT) as host of Evening Exchange, a public affairs show. Nnamdi hosted Evening Exchange until 2011. On June 13, 1990, Evening Exchange received its highest viewership numbers when Washington mayor Marion Barry announced on the show that he would not seek a fourth term. =Public Interest and The Kojo Nnamdi Show (1998‚Äìpresent)= On August 31, 1998, Nnamdi became host of Public Interest on Washington public radio station WAMU, a show renamed from The Derek McGinty Show. In January of that year, previous host Derek McGinty left WAMU for CBS News. A two-hour program, one hour focused on local issues and was broadcast exclusively on WAMU, and the other discussed national topics and was distributed by National Public Radio (NPR) to around 40 stations. On September 30, 2002, Public Interest was renamed The Kojo Nnamdi Show and dropped national distribution.https://web.archive.org/web/20021019051318/http://www.wamu.org/pi/shows/piarc_020923.html On Fridays, Nnamdi hosts The Politics Hour, which covers topics related to political issues and events in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including surrounding Maryland and Virginia regions. Before May 2008, the show was titled The D.C. Politics Hour and focused solely on the D.C.-area political scene. The show was renamed The Politics Hour in May 2008, after WAMU fired resident political analyst and Washington Examiner columnist Jonetta Rose Barras over a salary dispute. The show then featured guest analysts until the long-term hiring of WRC-TV political reporter Tom Sherwood in February 2009. Barras joined the program after Mark Plotkin left in April 2002 to set up shop at all-news station WTOP, where he hosts The Politics Program. Originally called The Politics Hour, the name of Plotkin's show was changed after WAMU threatened a lawsuit. Nonetheless, Plotkin said in a 2006 online chat that he and Nnamdi remain friendly and regularly have dinner together. Every Tuesday the first half of the show consists of a segment called Tech Tuesday that attempts to keep listeners current on various computer/computing and technology issues. For a number of years, the first Tuesday of the month featured \\"The Computer Guys,\\" John Gilroy and Tom Pivovar. Pivovar left the program in early 2006 in a contract dispute and has been since replaced with a rotation of recurring expert guests, most of whom are employed at either Mid-Atlantic Consulting or the University of Maryland, College Park.

Originally developed as a commercial venture by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of Stratford, Connecticut, it was used by the United States Coast Guard primarily for air- sea rescue. The HH-52 has been replaced by non-amphibious types such as the HH-65 Dolphin, which rely solely on the use of a winch from a low hover to conduct rescue operations. Design and development U.S. Coast Guard HH-52A floating in Port Angeles in 1979 A number of S-62s were bought by the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics for the US Coast Guard for use as a search and rescue helicopter. Initially designated HU2S-1G Seaguard, it was re-designated as the HH-52A Seaguard in 1962. The HH-52A used a boat hulled shaped fuselage, smaller but similar to the US Navy's SH-3 (Sikorsky S-61), and was employed aboard the larger Coast Guard cutters and icebreakers. The S-62 used a single General Electric T58-GE-8B turboshaft engine, a derated version of the T58-GE-10 powerplant used on the larger twin-engined SH-3; and a 1,050 hp T58-GE-6 derated to 670 hp, moving the same main and tail rotor as S-55 Model, in the prototype. The turbine powered S-62 could carry more weight and fly faster than the H-19 (S-55). The aircraft was first conceived and designed to be amphibious so that flotation gear would not be required for over water flights, and rescues could be made by landing on the water. The fuselage is watertight for landings on water or snow. Two outrigger floats resist pitching and rolling on the water. Although the HH-52A looks very different from the Sikorsky H-19, it used many of the same components. Variants ;S-62 : Prototype. First flew on 22 May 1958. ;S-62A : Amphibious transport helicopter, powered by a General Electric CT58-110-1 turboshaft engine, with accommodation for up to 11 passengers.

It was first identified from a museum specimen mislabelled as coming from Africa, hence the scientific name. Description The largest of the three species of South American weasel, Amazon weasels measure in total length, including a tail long. They have a typical body form for weasels, with a long, slender, torso and short legs and ears. They have short fur which varies from reddish to dark brown on the upper body, and is pale orange-tan on the underparts. A stripe of fur the same colour as that on the upper body runs down the centre of the chest and throat. The whiskers are short and the soles of the feet almost hairless. Females have three pairs of teats. Distribution and habitat Amazon weasels are known to inhabit the Amazon basin in northern Brazil and eastern Peru and Ecuador. However, the full extent of their range is unknown, and they probably also inhabit southern Colombia, Venezuela and the Guyanas, as well as northern Bolivia. The region is covered by tropical rainforest, and, while detailed habitat preferences are unknown, the weasel has mostly been recovered near rivers. Two subspecies are recognised: * M. a. africana (northeastern Brazil) * M. a. stolzmanni (northwestern Brazil, Peru, Ecuador) Biology and behaviour The Amazon weasel is rarely seen and little is known of its habits. They eat rodents and other small mammals, and have been reported to construct burrows in the stumps of hollow trees.Emmons, L.H. (1997). Neotropical Rainforest Mammals, 2nd ed. University of Chicago Press They have been found from sea level to , and have been reported to swim in rivers or estuaries, sometimes far from the shore.

Created by Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo, the character first appeared as an adversary of Batman. KGBeast has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films. Anatoli appeared in his first live adaptation as a recurring cast member on The CW television series Arrow played by David Nykl. Anatoli also appeared as a henchman for Lex Luthor in the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice played by Callan Mulvey. Publication history KGBeast first appeared in (March 1988) and was created by Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo. Fictional character biography =Backstory= Anatoli Knyazev (, ), code-named \\"The Beast\\", and known to the C.I.A. as the \\"KGBeast\\" was trained as an assassin by \\"The Hammer\\", a top secret cell of the KGB. In addition to being the master of several martial arts, his strength was cybernetically enhanced, and he had also mastered the use of every deadly weapon known. At the time of his first appearance, he was rumored to have killed at least 200 people. =First appearance= The Beast made his first appearance in the storyline, \\"Ten Nights of The Beast\\" Batman #417 (March 1988), which was later reprinted as a trade paperback of the same name. It was written by Jim Starlin and drawn by Jim Aparo and Mike DeCarlo. The Hammer's general, angry that the Soviet government was working to better relations with the United States, sent Knyazev on a mission to kill 10 high-ranking U.S. officials in an attempt to cripple the Strategic Defense Initiative program. These include scientists, civilian administrators, military figures, and politicians, the last of whom being then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, scheduled to visit Gotham City. Despite Batman's best efforts, the Beast eliminated nearly all of his targets. In particular, he showcased his ruthlessness by poisoning an entire banquet, killing over 100 people, just to ensure that his target would die. When Batman finally faced the Beast in hand- to-hand combat, the Beast quickly gained the upper hand, fleeing only because he thought Batman had back-up. During the rematch between the two, Batman snared the Beast's left wrist with the Batrope. Rather than be captured, the Beast grabbed a nearby axe and chopped off the restrained hand. The Beast quickly had the limb replaced with a cybernetic gun, made by one of Gotham's top weapons dealers. Before the final confrontation between Batman and the Beast, C.I.A. Agent Ralph Bundy reminded Batman that, if the Beast were to be captured alive, he would have to be handed over to the Soviets, and likely escape justice. Knowing this, Batman, after thwarting the Beast's assassination attempt on Reagan, destroyed the Beast's gun-arm, lured him into the sewers, and then cornered him in an underground room. The Beast invited Batman to fight him to the death, but instead Batman locked the room, effectively burying the assassin alive. In the later story, Batman: Year Three, Batman noted that he then contacted the police to pick up the subdued villain. =Later appearances= However, the Beast escaped and went into hiding, from where he saw the Soviet Union dissolve. His prot√©g√©, the NKVDemon, surfaced in Russia, but was killed by Batman's ally, Soviet police detective Nikita Krakov. The Beast became a traditional supervillain, engaging in a counterfeiting scheme and having additional cybernetic implants inserted into his body. He fought Robin and the Huntress, but was ultimately defeated by King Snake. He later acquired a nuclear bomb the size and shape of a baseball, which he used to threaten Gotham City. He was defeated by Robin and ultimately locked up in Blackgate Penitentiary.Robin (vol. 4) #14 (February 1995) (\\"Troika\\" Part Four) In the No Man's Land storyline, the Beast appeared as a henchman of Lock-Up, during the latter's tenure as the unofficial warden of Blackgate. One Year Later One year after the events of Infinite Crisis, the Beast was thrown from a roof by a man thought to be Two-Face, after the Beast botched an assassination. His lifeless body was later found by the police, his death caused by two gunshots to the head. Two-Face appeared to be innocent of the murder; the killer seemed to be the Tally Man, hired by the Great White Shark.Detective Comics #817 (May 2006) The Beast's corpse was later stolen by a mysterious group who were reanimating corpses and turning them into zombie-like soldiers.Nightwing (vol. 2) #142 (May 2008) His head was shown floating around in a tank with several life support devices, indicating that he would return at some point in the future.Nightwing (vol. 2) #143 (June 2008) Blackest Night As part of the Blackest Night story arc, KGBeast's corpse was reanimated by a black power ring and recruited to the Black Lantern Corps during the Blackest Night: Batman miniseries. He used his ring to form a black energy construct of his gun arm.Blackest Night: Batman #1 (October 2009) Post-Flashpoint As part of the New 52 the character got a new backstory First on the New Suicide Squad #2 (October 2014). KGBeast/Commander Anatoli Knyazev was a citizen of the USSR until it dissolved. He was trained by Boris Ulyanov/Hammer, as well as others like Kanto,\\"Batman #56 (2018) and has mastered several forms of martial arts. In addition he gained cybernetic abilities which increased his strength. He is and fight against the Suicide Squad as is a Russian military soldier after is many times lost is become is a member of Suicide Squad. =DC Rebirth= In DC Rebirth KGBeast is now simply The Beast. He is described as one of the world's best contract killers, who formerly worked for the U.S. government and typically is exclusive to Washington D.C.. His logo is a 666 symbol. He had his own private island constructed for the purposes of taking his captured enemies there and engaging them in a hunt to the death, free from any national jurisdictions. He is hired by the Penguin, Black Mask, and Great White to kill Batman and Two-Face after the latter threatens to release his collection of blackmail data to the world.All-Star Batman #4 Anatoli is last seen when, to stop him killing a group of rioting civilians, Batman lunges into him and over a cliff. Only Batman is saved by Duke Thomas, leaving Beast's fate uncertain.

During the prison break, KGBeast is shot with a blast by corrections officer Amazo.Flashpoint: Legion of Doom #2 (July 2011) In other media =Television= * KGBeast appears in Justice League Unlimited. In the episode, \\"Kids Stuff\\", he along with Blockbuster, Cheetah and Copperhead rob a gold vault only to be foiled by the Justice League. He later made several background appearances as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society. In the episode \\"Alive\\", KGBeast is seen fighting on Gorilla Grodd's side during his attempted mutiny against Lex Luthor before switching to the latter's side once the fight ends. * Anatoly Knyazev makes his live-action debut in Arrow, portrayed by David Nykl. He appears in both the present timeline and flashbacks beginning in season 2. He and Oliver Queen initially met near the island of Lian Yu, where Oliver helps him escape from Dr. Anthony Ivo. Years later, Oliver arrives in Russia looking to avenge a friend by killing a gangster known as Kovar. He seeks out Anatoly and joins the Bratva, eventually killing Kovar and returning to Star City. In the present timeline, Oliver seeks out Anatoly's aid on occasion. In season six, Anatoly becomes a recurring villain as part of Cayden James's cabal alongside Vincent Sobel, Laurel Lance and Ricardo Diaz. When Diaz usurps James by killing him, Anatoly abandons him in the season 6 finale after seeing that he lives and fights without honor, something he holds in high esteem. He once again begins working with Oliver, while also becoming an informant to A.R.G.U.S.. In season seven, Diaz seeks revenge on Anatoly for betraying him and slaughters his Bratva unit, though Oliver and his team save Anatoly, who leaves Star City not long after. In the season eight episode, \\"Prochnost,\\" Anatoly returns to Russia following Diaz's death and opens a bar. He helps Oliver, Laurel, and Mia Smoak procure a weapon that could used on the Monitor while tangling with Oleg's faction of the Bratva. Anatoly makes his last appearance in the series finale, \\"Fadeout\\", as a guest at Oliver's funeral after the latter gave his life to avert a world-ending crisis. * KGBeast appears in Harley Quinn voiced by Matt Oberg. Debuting in the episode \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", he is first depicted as an inmate of Arkham Asylum before making sporadic minor reappearances throughout the rest of the show, including competing against the show's titular character for a place in the Legion of Doom and losing to her. =Film= * KGBeast appears briefly in Batman: Assault on Arkham, voiced by Nolan North. He appears briefly as a recruit for the latest Suicide Squad, after being captured during an attack on a military base. When he awakens with the Squad, he believes Amanda Waller is bluffing after she warns them of the small nano-explosives implanted in the neck of each member. Waller allows him to walk out only to immediately execute him with the explosive to serve as a warning to the other Squad members should they abandon their mission. * Anatoly Knyazev appears in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, portrayed by Callan Mulvey. He appears as a mercenary, terrorist and weapons trafficker who secretly works for Lex Luthor as his main henchman.

They currently compete in the . History The club was established in 1896 and spent a single season in the East Midlands League. After several years without league football, the club joined the Northamptonshire League in 1909, and won the title in 1911‚Äì12. In 1933 the league was renamed the United Counties League. They left the league in 1939, but after a season in the Peterborough & District League, they rejoined the UCL in 1946. They won the league's Knockout Cup in 1952, a season in which they also won the Lincolnshire Senior B Cup. In 1955 they left the league again to join the Central Alliance, before joining the Midland League. In 1972 they returned to the UCL. They were champions in 1975‚Äì76 as well as winning the league cup and reaching the final of the FA Vase, where they lost 1‚Äì0 to Billericay Town after extra time. They won the league again in 1977‚Äì78 and the Lincolnshire Senior A Cup in 1978‚Äì79. They then went on to win the league three times in a row between 1979‚Äì80 and 1981‚Äì82, as well as the Knockout Cup in 1979‚Äì80 and 1981‚Äì82 and the FA Vase in 1979‚Äì80, when Guisborough Town were defeated 2‚Äì0 in the final. In 1983‚Äì84 they reached the final for a third time, but lost 3‚Äì2 to Stansted. After the winning the UCL Premier Division title again in 1996‚Äì97 and 1997‚Äì98, Stamford joined the Midland Division of the Southern League, which was renamed the Eastern Division at the end of their first season. In 2003‚Äì04 they finished seventh and were promoted to the Premier Division due to league restructuring, but were relegated after a single season. In 2005‚Äì06 they reached the promotion play-offs, and after defeating Barking & East Ham United 3‚Äì2 in the semi-finals, they beat Wivenhoe Town 2‚Äì1 in the final with a goal from Mark Foster to earn promotion. Stamford fared better in their second Premier Division stint finishing the campaign in eighth place. The season ended with silverware as the Daniels claimed their fifth different county cup, beating Brigg Town to win the Senior Shield at Lincoln City's Sincil Bank Stadium. At the end of July 2012 Chris Rivett joined the board of directors and was appointed as Chairman two weeks later. Under his stewardship, during the 2012‚Äì13 season the club announced that together with the town's college they were going to move into a new stadium on Ryhall Road, Stamford for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Drury left The Daniels halfway through the 2012‚Äì13 season to take charge of Boston United so in January 2013 the board gave Wayne Hatswell his managerial debut with current player David Staff as his assistant. Hatswell guided Stamford to the play-offs, finishing 4th to set up a semi-final trip to 3rd place Belper. Recovering form 2‚Äì0 down after 10 minutes, Stamford won the game 4‚Äì2 to set up a play-off final at home to Chasetown. A bumper crowd of 864 saw Stamford win 2‚Äì1 to gain promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the first time since 2008. Stamford then had another managerial change with Hatswell leaving for a coaching role at League 2 Newport County. His deputy David Staff was promoted for his first managerial position for the 2013-2014 campaign. The season culminated in winning the Lincolnshire Senior Trophy in the final against Brigg Town. The 2014-15 season was the last started at the Wothorpe Road ground, and their last game there on 22 November before the club moved to their new home at the Zeeco Stadium. On 13 December 2014 the club started a new chapter with the first game in the Zeeco Stadium. Unfortunately it took longer than expected to get their first home league win - it came down to the last game of the season (April 2015) against Witton Albion - when the win was the only way to stay in the Premier Division. The 2016-17 season saw The Daniels reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history, by claiming the scalp of National League side Wrexham by winning 3-2 away in a 4th qualifying round replay. Stamford's reward was an away trip to League Two side Hartlepool United where they eventually succumbed to a 3-0 defeat. Ground The new pitch at the Borderville Sports Centre Stamford F.C. covered terrace end stand Stamford F.C. seated main stand From the formation of the club in 1894 until the end of 2014 the club played on Hanson's Field in Kettering Road, St Martins. When the Burghley Estate, owners of the land, decided to redevelop that site for housing a new stadium was built in conjunction with the nascent Sports Institute of New College, Stamford at Borderville on Ryhall Road, to the north of town. The stadium has a terrace behind one of the goals as well as an all-seated stand along one side of the pitch with room for 300 spectators. The first game at the Borderville ground was on 13 December 2014 in a Northern Premier League match against Nantwich Town. The highest attendance at the Borderville ground is 1,572 set on 10 July 2019 when Stamford played League One side Peterborough United in a Pre-Season Friendly.

The Wilson Creek Bridge is located in Montgomery County and was built as part of the Virginia Smart Road project. It is a cast- in-place cantilever box girder bridge and extends for with three spans of and two spans of .  Construction  Construction began in August 1998. The bridge was designed by Florida-based Figg Engineering Group and built by PCL Civil Constructors Inc., a subsidiary of PCL Constructors Inc. at a cost of US$17.4 million. The bridge design is the same genre as the Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge. The bridge is composed of four double-tapered piers with stone inlay, two conventional abutments, and 100 cast-in-place segments. After review of the bridge design by the construction firm, the segments were changed from 4.5 m to 5 m segments, deleting 35 segments from the critical path of construction. The bridge was completed on May 30, 2001. The cast-in- place structure consists of of concrete, of reinforcing steel, and of steel cables.  Awards  In 2002, the bridge received an honorable mention in the Federal Highway Administration's Excellence in Highway Design Awards, Category 3A: Major Highway Structures Over $10 Million. The bridge also received an award that year from the Concrete Reinforced Steel Institute, the only 2002 award-winner east of the Mississippi River.  Unique Features  The cast-in- place cantilever box girder bridge design is the only one of its kind in Virginia. The bridge is hollow. Beneath the riding surface, the box girders are open with a width of and a height which varies from to . Power and communication lines are carried in the hollow concrete box and run the length of the bridge. Manholes in the bridge deck allow researchers to enter the box to monitor testing equipment. The support structure of the bridge is inlaid with Hokie Stone to blend in with the environment and meld with the architectural stylings of Virginia Tech.

This includes Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, melanoma, and testicular cancer. It is given by injection into a vein. Most people experience some side effects. Commonly it causes a change in sensation, constipation, weakness, loss of appetite, and headaches. Severe side effects include low blood cell counts and shortness of breath. It should not be given to people who have a current bacterial infection. Use during pregnancy will likely harm the baby. Vinblastine works by blocking cell division. Vinblastine was isolated in 1958. An example of a natural herbal remedy that has since been developed into a conventional medicine, vinblastine was originally obtained from the Madagascar periwinkle. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.  Medical uses  Vinblastine is a component of a number of chemotherapy regimens, including ABVD for Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also used to treat histiocytosis according to the established protocols of the Histiocytosis Association. Side effects Adverse effects of vinblastine include hair loss, loss of white blood cells and blood platelets, gastrointestinal problems, high blood pressure, excessive sweating, depression, muscle cramps, vertigo and headaches. Pharmacology Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid and a chemical analogue of vincristine. It binds tubulin, thereby inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. Vinblastine treatment causes M phase specific cell cycle arrest by disrupting microtubule assembly and proper formation of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochore, each of which are necessary for the separation of chromosomes during anaphase of mitosis. Toxicities include bone marrow suppression (which is dose-limiting), gastrointestinal toxicity, potent vesicant (blister-forming) activity, and extravasation injury (forms deep ulcers). Vinblastine paracrystals may be composed of tightly-packed unpolymerized tubulin or microtubules. Vinblastine is reported to be an effective component of certain chemotherapy regimens, particularly when used with bleomycin, and methotrexate in VBM chemotherapy for Stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphomas. The inclusion of vinblastine allows for lower doses of bleomycin and reduced overall toxicity with larger resting periods between chemotherapy cycles. Mechanism of action The complex of tubulin and vinblastine. Vinblastine is shown in yellow. Microtubule- disruptive drugs like vinblastine, colcemid, and nocodazole have been reported to act by two mechanisms. At very low concentrations they suppress microtubule dynamics and at higher concentrations they reduce microtubule polymer mass. Recent findings indicate that they also produce microtubule fragments by stimulating microtubule minus-end detachment from their organizing centers. Dose-response studies further indicate that enhanced microtubule detachment from spindle poles correlate best with cytotoxicity. Isolation and synthesis Vinblastine may be isolated from the Madagascar Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), along with several of its precursors, catharanthine and vindoline. Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed. Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16‚ÄôS, C14‚ÄôR stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine. Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20. The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps. In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed by a series of cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry. The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%. Stereochemistry is controlled through a mixture of chiral agents (Sharpless catalysts), and reaction conditions (temperature, and selected enantiopure starting materials).  History  Vinblastine was first isolated by Robert Noble and Charles Thomas Beer at the University of Western Ontario from the Madagascar periwinkle plant. Vinblastine's utility as a chemotherapeutic agent was first suggested by its effect on the body when an extract of the plant was injected in rabbits to study the plant's supposed anti-diabetic effect. (A tea made from the plant was a folk-remedy for diabetes.) The rabbits succumbed to a bacterial infection, due to a decreased number of white blood cells, so it was hypothesized that vinblastine might be effective against cancers of the white blood cells such as lymphoma.

Thrall began his recording career in 1972. He played guitar, vocals, and percussion with the group Cookin Mama, which had his brother, Preston Thrall, on percussion. They released the album New Day in 1972. Thrall was born and raised in Alameda, California. Starting as a drummer at 11, then moving to guitar at 13, by age 15 he joined the Alameda band \\"Cookin‚Äô Mama\\". The band had some success in the San Francisco Bay Area and released the album \\"New Day\\" in 1972. At age 18 Thrall was involved in the first ever instructional book for rock guitar titled \\"Improvising Rock Guitar Vol 1\\". Career Thrall has worked with former Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes on the Hughes/Thrall project, and was a member of the Pat Travers Band during the peak of their success. He co-wrote one of Pat Travers' biggest hits, a hard-driving tune entitled \\"Snortin' Whiskey\\", which became one of the most requested songs on American radio in 1980. Thrall later joined Asia, and played lead guitar for Meat Loaf during that artist's major comeback in the 1990s. He began attracting attention as a guitarist in 1976 after the release of \\"Automatic Man\\" (signed by Chris Blackwell-Island Records), a band that was put together by former Santana drummer, Michael Shrieve. The band recorded their first album in London with Keith Harwood producing (Led Zeppelin Presence, The Rolling Stones Black and Blue). In 1978, Thrall was chosen for the co-lead spot with Pat Travers. He recorded three LP's with Travers: Heat In The Street, Go For What You Know and Crash And Burn. Their first hit was \\"Boom Boom Out Goes The Lights\\". The latter LP featured the hit \\"Snortin' Whiskey\\", which Thrall co-wrote with Travers. Thrall came to the attention of Glenn Hughes; the chemistry between the two clicked immediately when they formed Hughes/Thrall in 1981 in Los Angeles. The album was co-produced by Andy Johns and Rob Fraboni. The record was not a commercial success but furthered Thrall's reputation with many musicians at the time citing the Hughes/Thrall record as a major inspiration. Gary Moore gave Thrall a nod crediting him for \\"inspiration\\" on the Gary Moore & G-Force album. After the demise of Hughes/Thrall he moved to New York and worked as a studio musician and as a sideman touring with major artists. He recorded two albums with the Jamaican rhythm section Sly and Robbie. He played on the Tina Turner album \\"Foreign Affair\\" and was featured on the classic \\"Simply The Best\\". In 1988, Thrall toured and recorded with the legendary Jack Bruce of Cream fame. The performance at The Bitter End in New York City was historic as it reunited Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton for the first time since the last Cream concert at the Royal Albert Hall. He recorded and toured with Meat Loaf on his 1993 comeback record \\"Bat Out of Hell II\\" which was one of the biggest albums of the year with the hit \\"I Would Do Anything for Love\\". After recording two more albums and after several tours Thrall left Meat Loaf in 1996 and opened one of the first Pro Tools based production suites at Avatar studios in New York City. The technology was in its infancy but Thrall saw the incredible possibilities and put together a mobile system that could be taken to the other studios at Avatar. Thrall found his niche and success as producer and engineer, becoming a technology leader, pioneering the use of Pro Tools for studio recordings. He has also lent his talent and support to initiatives such as Nelson Mandela's foundation to fight AIDS in Africa. Between 2007 and 2011, he worked with producers Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, who were responsible for Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\", Justin Bieber's \\"Baby\\", Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies\\", Mariah Carey's \\"Touch My Body\\", and Jay Z's \\"Holy Grail\\". Since 2014, he has continued to work on such projects as Demi Lovato's version of \\"Let It Go\\"; Celine Dion and Stevie Wonder's duet of \\"Overjoyed\\", and many songs with Jessie J, including the duet with Tom Jones, \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\\".

Evil Star's mind shuts down, and he is returned to the Guardians for re-education. Evil Star is freed by Neron, with enhanced Starlings, but returned to captivity by the Darkstars and Guy Gardner. Guy Gardner,Warrior #37 Evil Star was mentioned, seemingly in passing, by Sister Sercy of the Blue Lantern Corps as a menace to her homeworld. It is unknown if the Evil Star she refers to is a past version, or a previously unheard-of version of the villain.Green Lantern Vol. 4, #42 Evil Star is also cited as the guiding force behind the Kroloteans abducting William Hand, searching Hand's insides for the blackness that would lead to the Blackest Night.Green Lantern Vol. 4, #43 Evil Star appears in Grant Morrison and Liam Sharp's The Green Lantern. Slavers from Dhor free him from the Southern Supervoid where he was being incarcerated by the Guardians of the Universe. They then attack him and remove his Starbrand, which was preserving his youth, causing him to rapidly age. They abandon him, near death, in Sector 2814 where he is hospitalized. The Green Lantern Vol. 1, #2 Powers and abilities Evil Star's primary weapon is the Starband. The Starband draws the energy of the stars to prolong Evil Star's lifespan, enable him to fly, survive in space, create force blasts or hard light constructs, and powers the Starlings. Starlings are miniature versions of Evil Star that possess superhuman strength and invulnerability, and are under his complete control. Starlings need direct commands from Evil Star to function, and they become directionless if he is unconscious. If Evil Star is kept away from starlight for a prolonged period, his powers fade away. Since starlight is the same as sunlight, the Starband's force blasts and constructs serve to increase Superman's powers. Other versions Evil Star has appeared in some Elseworlds stories: =Batman: In Darkest Knight= In the Elseworlds tale, Batman: In Darkest Knight, a version of Evil Star exists. Harvey Dent was the Gotham District Attorney and was shown to be more supportive of Green Lantern than Commissioner Gordon. Sinestro, after becoming deranged from absorbing Joe Chill's mind, scarred Dent's face and empowered him along with Selina Kyle (known as Star Sapphire) and sent them out to kill the Green Lantern, with Dent known as Binary Star. Even though they were defeated, the pair managed to escape back to Sinestro.Batman: In Darkest Night =JLA: Another Nail= In the Elseworlds tale, JLA: Another Nail, the follow-up to JLA: The Nail, Evil Star makes an appearance.JLA: Another Nail #1JLA: Another Nail #2 In other media =Television= * Evil Star was featured in the Green Lantern episode \\"Evil is as Evil Does\\" voiced by Paul Frees.

The sixth known tropical cyclone, fifth named storm, and fourth hurricane of the season, Ethel developed from a disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico on September 14\\\\. After becoming a tropical storm, Ethel rapidly intensified and became a hurricane six hours later. By early on September 15, the storm reached major hurricane intensity when it became a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. However, shortly thereafter, Ethel rapidly weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane while brushing eastern Louisiana. Later on September 15, Ethel weakened to a tropical storm. Early on the following day, Ethel made landfall in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The storm gradually weakened inland, before eventually dissipating over southern Kentucky on September 17\\\\. Ethel was the first major hurricane since Hurricane Audrey of 1957. In Louisiana, the western edge of the storm produced light rainfall and hurricane-force winds, though no damage occurred in that state. Offshore of Mississippi, rough seas inundated Horn Island and split Ship Island. Tropical storm force winds in the southern portion of the state littered broken glass, trees, and signs across streets in Pascagoula, as well as down power lines, which caused some residents to lose electricity. In Alabama, winds damaged beach cottages in cities along the Gulf Coast, and damaged crops in five counties in the southern portion of the state. Although large amounts of precipitation fell in the extreme western portions of the state, no flooding occurred in Florida. A lightning strike to a power station near Tallahassee caused a brief citywide blackout. The storm spawned five tornadoes in Florida and Alabama, one of which destroyed 25 homes. Outside the Gulf Coast of the United States, rain fell in other states, but no damage is known to have occurred. Overall, Ethel caused 1 fatality and $1.5 million (1960 USD) in damage. Meteorological history Hurricane Ethel originated from a small tropical disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico on the morning of September 14, 1960. It is estimated that Ethel developed into a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on that day, with an initial intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h). The disturbance quickly developed within a region favoring intensification and the New Orleans Hurricane Warning Office issued their first advisory on the system, classifying it as an area of low pressure, at 1500 UTC. Roughly six hours after becoming a tropical storm, Ethel was upgraded to a hurricane as it underwent an intense phase of explosive deepening. By this time, gale-force winds extended 150 miles (240 km) to the north of the center and 80 miles (130 km) to the south. Ethel further intensified into a major hurricane, as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States. Following a pass through the storm by a United States Navy reconnaissance plane, Ethel was declared a \\"severe hurricane\\" with winds reaching 115 mph (190 km/h), equivalent to a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. At the time these winds were measured, a barometric pressure of 974 mbar (hPa; 28.7 inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to the hurricane. However, shortly thereafter, cool, dry air began to entrain the storm, causing it to rapidly weaken. In a six-hour span, the storm suddenly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, a decrease of 25 mph (110 km/h). As Ethel neared landfall, forecasters within the United States Weather Bureau were unsure of the future track and intensity of the hurricane due to the unusual strengthening and weakening. Around 1100 UTC on September 15, the center of Ethel brushed the coastline of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Continuing northward, the hurricane further weakened to a tropical storm as it was approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. Shortly before 0000 UTC on September 16, Ethel made landfall in Pascagoula, Mississippi with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Gradual weakening took place as the storm moved inland over Mississippi and by 1800 UTC on September 16, Ethel was further downgraded to a tropical depression. The remnants of the former hurricane continued moving towards the north-northwest before dissipating on September 17 over southern Kentucky. Preparations Prior to Ethel's arrival, adequate warning allowed roughly 12,000 residents along the Mississippi coastline to evacuate to shelters, set up at churches and schools. Along a stretch of the Gulf Coastline, all fishing villages fully evacuated to safer places. In Louisiana, at least 2,000 people had been evacuated from Grand Isle. Other towns were placed under emergency evacuations where Coast Guard boats were used to move residents to safer areas. Military aircraft were also moved from Keesler Air Force Base to other airfields across the country. Numerous schools and businesses were closed on September 15 in fears of a worst-case scenario, a storm with 160 mph (260 km/h) winds passing directly over Mobile, Alabama, a city of roughly 150,000 people. In Florida, the National Weather Bureau stated that preparations were not being undertaken fast enough nor as extensive as warranted. According to the Red Cross, 48,000 people in the threatened region sought refuge in shelters; civil defense stated that 65,000 residents moved to shelters. Impact Hurricane Ethel's rainfall within the United States Before the storm weakened rapidly, people feared a large storm surge over much of southeastern Louisiana. Preparing for the storm induced stress, which in one person contributed a fatal heart attack. In Louisiana, a compact, rapidly weakening Hurricane Ethel brought significant wind and rain primarily east and southeast of New Orleans. However, the storm caused a maximum surge of only . Although Ethel weakened significantly, the hurricane still lashed far southeastern Louisiana. At the United States Coast Guard station in Quarantine in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, sustained winds reached . A weather station in Venice reported a sustained wind speed of and gusts to . Rainfall totals included at Quarantine, at Hopedale, at Buras, at Burrwood, and at Port Sulfur. Hurricane Ethel caused substantial beach erosion throughout the barrier islands of Mississippi but brought a relatively small storm surge of along the populated coastline. Roughly of the east end of Horn Island (Mississippi) was lost. The storm also split Ship Island into two islands, east and west Ship Islands. However, few knew of this split until Hurricane Camille in 1969 Atlantic hurricane season substantially widened the split. The sustained wind reached a maximum of in Biloxi, Mississippi. Throughout the Mississippi Gulf Coast, winds reached gusts approached . In Pascagoula, Mississippi, broken glass, fallen trees and signs covered the streets. Several areas were also flooded and power was lost in area where power lines were downed by high winds. Following the storm, Governor of Mississippi Ross Barnett ordered 100 Mississippi National Guard to Pascagoula and requested other troops in other areas. High winds also affected Alabama, reaching and gusts of at Fort Morgan (Alabama). Slight damage to beach cottages occurred in Dauphin Island and Gulf Shores and along Mobile Bay. Minor crop losses were reported in Clarke, Escambia, Mobile, Monroe, and Washington counties. An F2 tornado also injured two people in the town of Mignon.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/19600916.1.10 Hurricane Ethel also brought heavy rains and strong winds to much of the Florida Panhandle. A maximum of of rain fell at an agricultural experiment station near Milton, Florida, the highest total measured at an official station and attributed to this storm. Hurricane Donna struck Tampa, Florida, particularly hard earlier in the month, causing major flooding of Hillsborough River (Florida) at Zephyrhills, Florida on 12 September. People feared severe flooding of the Hillsborough River into Tampa, which did not occur. The highest wind gust in the state was , measured in both Pensacola and Apalachicola. A thunderstorm associated with Ethel produced lightning that hit a power station near Tallahassee, causing a citywide blackout for . According to Florida Highway Patrol, Ethel directly caused damage of $100,000 (1960 USD) in the state. Additionally Ethel spawned four tornadoes in Florida, one of which reached F2 intensity and damaged or destroyed 25 homes near Panama City. Beyond the Gulf Coast of the United States, Ethel dropped rainfall in the states of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, causing little if any damage. Throughout its path, Ethel caused $1.5 million (1960 USD) in damage and one indirect fatality.

It is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It grows in moist, shady locations. Growth Houttuynia cordata is a herbaceous perennial plant that can grow to , spreading up to . The proximal part of the stem is trailing and produces adventitious roots, while the distal part of the stem grows vertically. The leaves are alternate, broadly heart-shaped, long and broad. Its flowers are greenish-yellow and borne on a terminal spike long with four to six large white basal bracts. It normally blooms in the summer. It is considered an invasive plant because of its ability to regrow rhizomes from any segment of its foliage. Cultivation Houttuynia cordata 'Chameleon' Houttuynia cordata grows in moist to wet soil or slightly submerged in water, as long as it is exposed partially or fully to the sun. It can become invasive in gardens and difficult to eradicate as their roots run deep and actively spread. It propagates by division. It is usually found in one of its cultivated forms in temperate gardens. The 'Chameleon' variety (synonymous with H.cordata 'Court Jester', 'Tricolour', and 'Variegata') is slightly less vigorous than the parent species, with stubbier leaves mottled in both yellow and red. Another common variety, 'Flore Pleno', has masses of white bracts and retains the vigor of the parent species.

Nephila consists of numerous species found in warmer regions around the world. They are commonly called golden silk orb-weavers, golden orb-weavers, giant wood spiders, or banana spiders. Etymology The genus name Nephila is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning \\"fond of spinning\\", from the words ŒΩŒµ·øñŒΩ (nein) = to spin (related to nema ŒΩŒÆŒºŒ± \\"thread\\") + œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ (philos) = \\"love\\". Description Nephila spiders vary from reddish to greenish yellow in color with distinctive whiteness on the cephalothorax and the beginning of the abdomen. Like many species of the superfamily Araneoidea, most of them have striped legs specialized for weaving (where their tips point inward, rather than outward as is the case with many wandering spiders). Their contrast of dark brown/black and green/yellow allows warning and repelling of potential predators to which their venom might be of little danger. Golden orb-weavers reach sizes of 4.8‚Äì5.1 cm (1.5‚Äì2 in) in females, not including legspan, with males being usually two-thirds smaller (less than 2.5 cm, 1 in). In 2012, a large individual was photographed killing and consuming a 0.5-m-long brown tree snake in Freshwater, Queensland. Species from Taiwan have been known to reach over , legspan included, in mountainous country. In 2014, a study discovered that golden orb-weavers living in urban areas, particularly areas of a high socioeconomic status, grew larger and carried more eggs than those in their native habitats. A number of possible explanations were suggested, such as increased food supplies due to artificial light or lack of predators and parasites. Species it contains eleven species and one subspecies: *Nephila comorana Strand, 1916 ‚Äì Comoros, Mayotte *Nephila constricta Karsch, 1879 ‚Äì Tropical Africa *Nephila cornuta (Pallas, 1772) ‚Äì Guyana *Nephila dirangensis Biswas & Biswas, 2006 ‚Äì India *Nephila kuhlii (Doleschall, 1859) ‚Äì India to Indonesia (Sulawesi) *Nephila laurinae Thorell, 1881 ‚Äì China to Solomon Is. *Nephila pakistaniensis Ghafoor & Beg, 2002 ‚Äì Pakistan *Nephila pilipes (Fabricius, 1793) (type) ‚Äì India to China, Vietnam, Philippines, Australia **Nephila p. malagassa Strand, 1907 ‚Äì Madagascar *Nephila robusta Tikader, 1962 ‚Äì India *Nephila tetragnathoides (Walckenaer, 1841) ‚Äì Fiji, Tonga, Niue *Nephila vitiana (Walckenaer, 1847) ‚Äì Indonesia, Fiji, Tonga Trichonephila clavipes (or \\"banana spider\\") found most commonly in Central America was formerly classified as Nephila clavipes. Additional fossil species are known from the Cenozoic. In 2012 Geratonephila burmanica was described from the Cenomanian aged Burmese amber, Wunderlich 2015 synonymised Geratonephilia with Nephilia tenuis, a species from the Dominican Amber, as he considered it unlikely that the amber was actually Burmese in origin. Though largely ambiguous, the origins of Nephila are undoubtedly Gondowanan. With the prime candidates being Africa, Indomalaya, and Australasia. Black wood spider (Nephila kuhlii).jpgN. kuhlii dorsal side Black wood spider (Nephila kuhlii) ventral.jpgN. kuhlii ventral side Distribution and habitat Golden silk orb-weavers are widespread in warmer regions throughout the world, with species in Australia, Asia, Africa (including Madagascar), and the Americas. Spiderlings can be carried by the wind over long distances, and each year, a small number of golden orb web spiders are found in New Zealand (where they are not endemic) after having been blown across the Tasman Sea; the spiders usually end up in the North Island. Whilst the geographic distribution of Nephila is large, many habitat similarities are seen between these locations. A warm and reasonably wet climate is generally preferred, as these are some of the environmental cues that induce spiderling hatching.Higgins, L. (2017). Nephila Life Cycle. [online] Uvm.edu. Available at: http://www.uvm.edu/~lehiggin/LifeCycle.html [Accessed 30 May 2017]. Locally, spiders look for relatively dense vegetation where webs can be set up in areas that insects will regularly fly through. Urban environments are also attractive due to the large prey concentrations and lower levels of predation.Harvey, M., Austin, A. and Adams, M. (2007). The systematics and biology of the spider genus Nephila (Araneae:Nephilidae) in the Australasian region. Invertebrate Systematics, 21(5), p.407. Behavior =Web spinning and structure= Nephila spiders produce large asymmetric orb webs up to in diameter. Nephila species remain in their webs permanently, so have a higher predation risk. The golden silk orb-weaver is named for the yellow color of the spider silk used to construct these webs. Yellow threads of their web shine like gold in sunlight. Carotenoids are the main contributors to this yellow color, but xanthurenic acid, two quinones, and an unknown compound may also aid in the color. Experimental evidence suggests that the silk's color may serve a dual purpose: sunlit webs ensnare bees that are attracted to the bright yellow strands, whereas in shady spots, the yellow blends in with background foliage to act as a camouflage. The spider is able to adjust pigment intensity relative to background light levels and color; the range of spectral reflectance is specifically adapted to insect vision. The webs of most Nephila spiders are complex, with a fine-meshed orb suspended in a maze of non-sticky barrier webs. As with many weavers of sticky spirals, the orb is renewed regularly if not daily, apparently because the stickiness of the orb declines with age. When weather is good (and no rain has damaged the orb web), subadults and adults often rebuild only a portion of the web. The spider removes and consumes the portion to be replaced, builds new radial elements, then spins the new spirals. This partial orb renewal is distinct from other orb-weaving spiders that usually replace the entire orb web. The web of Nephila antipodiana contains ant-repellent chemicals to protect the web. Typically, the golden orb-weaver first weaves a nonsticky spiral with space for two to 20 more spirals in between (the density of sticky spiral strands decreases with increasing spider size). When she has completed the coarse weaving, she returns and fills in the gaps. Whereas most orb-weaving spiders remove the nonsticky spiral when spinning the sticky spiral, Nephila spiders leave it. This produces a \\"manuscript paper\\" effect when the orb is seen in the sun: groups of sticky spirals reflecting light with \\"gaps\\" where the nonsticky spiral does not reflect the light. In relation to the ground, the webs of adults may be woven from eye-level upwards high into the tree canopy. The orb web is usually truncated by a top horizontal support strand, giving it an incomplete look. Adjacent to one face of the main orb, a rather extensive and haphazard-looking network of guard-strands may be suspended a few cm distant across a free space. This network is often decorated with a lumpy string or two of plant detritus and insect carcasses clumped with silk. This \\"barrier web\\" may function as a kind of early-warning system for incoming prey or against spider-hunting predators, or as a shield against windblown leaves; it may also be remnants of the owner's previous web. At least one reference explains the suspended debris-chain as a cue for birds to avoid blundering into and destroying the web. =Prey capture and feeding= The golden silk orb-weaver targets many different organisms as prey, ranging from small flies and beetles to larger cicadas and locusts. As a result of their strong web structure, small birds and bats can also become trapped and fed upon. Whilst most of the captured prey is relatively small compared to Nephila, the majority of biomass consumed comes from larger, rarer prey. Prey larger than 66% of the captor's size accounts for just 16.5% of prey captured, but 85% of prey consumed, indicating the spider is selective in its feeding habits. Spiders are notified that potential prey has been caught in the web through vibrations along strands, and these can be followed to the prey location on the web and be used to estimate prey size. Nephila species also create caches of food for storage, which can be found above the hub of the web and contain up to 15 prey items. These items are arranged in a line vertically and are wrapped in silk to reduce dehydration. Caches are created and grow when prey is readily available and more biomass is available for consumption than is required by the spider. The purpose of caches is to have a backup food source when prey is scarce and occasionally to provide bait to attract more prey to the web. Nephila species may also respond to food shortages by moving their webs, but this is a response to longer periods of prey scarcity than cache creation.Robinson, M. and Robinson, B. (1973). Ecology and behavior of the giant wood spider Nephila maculata (Fabricius) in New Guinea. Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, (149), pp.1-76. Web moving is seen as a result of environmental change, whereas caches occur from environmental fluctuation. =Mating and reproduction= N. pilipes female with many males Nephila spiders display large sexual dimorphism in size, with females being greatly larger than males. Debate exists as to whether this is a result of male dwarfism or female gigantism. Smaller males may be selected for due to the presence of competition for mating. Smaller males are quicker and more nimble, allowing them to be able to catch the females more easily, as well as to escape when threatened. Larger males may have to wait for the female to come close due to their slower speed. Larger females may have been selected for as a result of males using mating plugs upon copulation. Larger individuals reduce the success of these plugs, allowing for multiple mating and reducing the risk of genital mutilation. Gigantism in females is also associated with fecundity, as larger individuals can produce more eggs and therefore increase reproductive success. When males are fully mature, they leave their webs to search for a suitable female, often using web characteristics to identify potential mates. Often, multiple males attempt to court the same female, thus competition for territory on the web occurs, but is rarely physical, as smaller males surrender area to larger ones. When males approach females, they are often feeding, allowing the males to get closer without an aggressive response and also meaning the female is not moving. On approach, the male makes himself known by tapping on a web strand to ensure the female is amenable before proceeding to mate. When met with aggression, males stop approaching and remain in the same location until the female relaxes or they retreat. Females engage in multiple mating, but no benefit to the offspring occurs as a result of this; however, the energy cost of repelling a male is higher than that of allowing him to copulate.Smith, R. (1984). Sperm Competition and the Evolution of Animal Mating systems. 1st ed. Elsevier, pp.223-250. As a result of this, sperm competition occurs through males altering the duration and frequency of mating, with longer mating being proportional to a greater likelihood of success. Sexual cannibalism is uncommon in Nephila as a result of male mating behaviours. By copulating when females are immobile after molting or inactive due to feeding, the males increase their chances of survival. Males also approach from the side of the web opposite the female, increasing the odds of a successful approach. Sexual cannibalism does still occur, but generally is more common with larger males, and from older females. Females produce an egg sac in the surrounding environs of the web to protect their eggs. The eggs are deposited on a silk platform, then are covered in loose silk to form a sac, which is firmly attached to surrounding vegetation so that it is hidden from the view of predators. These sacs can contain from 300 to 3000 eggs, depending on mating success and particular species. Once hatched, the spiderlings inhabit a communal web to begin their lives. =Thermoregulation= Nephila spiders change their body positioning relative to the sun to maintain internal temperatures at an optimal level. As ambient temperatures increase, the spiders position themselves so the abdomen shades the cephalothorax from the sun. Spiders may also hang from their hind legs as a result of the heat due to a loss of hydrostatic pressure. Conversely, as temperatures cool down, the spiders position themselves perpendicular to the sun to retain as much heat energy as possible. When ambient temperatures reach extreme highs (above 40 ¬∞C), they may leave their webs and seek shade in the surrounding environment.Humphreys, W. F. (1993). Criteria for identifying thermal behaviour in spiders: a low technology approach. Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 33, 543‚Äì550. =Predation and parasitism= Predation of Nephila species is relatively uncommon; when it does occur, the main group affected are the juvenile individuals. The major predators are birds, but wasps and damselflies also prey upon smaller juveniles. Nephila species are frequently parasitized by Argyrodes, a genus of very small black-and-silver spiders that are kleptoparasitic. As many as a few dozen may infest a single Nephila web to feed from the host spider's captured prey. The frequent rebuilding or abandoning of webs by Nephila may be a tactic for controlling Argyrodes. Spiny orb-weaver spiders of the genus Gasteracantha also inhabit the webs of Nephila as kleptoparasites. Egg sacs generally remain free from both predation and parasitism, often due to the close proximity of the mother and how well it is hidden. Lifecycle =Spiderlings= Nephila spiderlings leave the egg sac as a result of environmental cues, often warmer and wetter conditions in spring. They then live on a communal web, eating dead siblings and web debris for around a week before dispersing to make individual webs.Higgins, L. (2017). Nephila Life Cycle. [online] Uvm.edu. Available at: http://www.uvm.edu/~lehiggin/LifeCycle.html. Young spiders do not generally build yellow-colored silk, and the young themselves can be easily mistaken for young orchard spiders (Leucauge) in general color and shape (both genera sport silver stripes or patches on their abdomens, described in some references as a form of heat control). The best distinction between Leucauge and Nephila juveniles is web structure: Leucauge species tend to build horizontal orbs that form a perfect circle, whereas Nephila species build vertical, elliptical orbs that are incomplete (missing the portion of the orb over the hub, the center where the spider sits). The latter seem to prefer more open habitat such as second-growth scrub or forest edges. Fences or building overhangs often do just as nicely. =Molting and growth= Once they are juvenile, Nephila spiders inhabit their individual webs, then begin their growth by the molting process. The time between molts is called an instar and seven to 12 of these can occur depending on food availability. Ecdysis, the shedding of the exoskeleton, occurs through the formation of a soft exoskeleton inside the current one. Once the old exoskeleton is shed, the new, larger one begins to harden. Ecdysis occurs when the spider's mass becomes too great for the current exoskeleton to support.Higgins, L. (2017). \\"Summer: Growth by Molting\\". uvm.edu. The University of Vermont. Male spiders seek out females for copulation and live on their webs. When mating season arrives, both males and females stop molting and remain the same size for the remainder of their lives. Venom The venom of the golden silk orb-weaver is effective in action on prey, but has not been reported to be of any notable consequence for humans if accidentally bitten. In the literature, Nephila is one of several genera where the venom \\"must be considered as more or less ineffectual in human beings\\". That said, the potentially large size of several members of the genus means that they possess relatively strong chelicerae, so any bite can cause some mechanical damage, but only of short-term localised effect for humans. However, further studies of the venom components are needed to better understand pathways associated with any toxicity. Interaction with humans Nephila do not seem to form either beneficial or harmful relationships with humans. Females often construct their webs using human structures as a base for support strands due to their stability. Individuals are often found in urban and suburban environments due to the protection from predation and greater prey availability. As they weave their webs in bushes and near flowers, they might present a nuisance for gardeners or flower pickers. Some nests near fruits may repel or destroy known pests, such as Tephritid fruit flies, without the need to use insecticides. Spiders may bite humans if provoked but more often flee if confronted. =Golden silk= Cape made from Madagascar golden orb-weaver spider silk, Victoria and Albert Museum, London There have been several efforts in the past to produce garments from Nephila silk although none commercially viable.Heimer, S. (1988). Wunderbare Welt der Spinnen. Urania. p.14 These include two bed hangings that were shown at the 1900 Paris Exhibition. In 2004 a textile designer, Simon Peers, and an entrepreneur, Nicholas Godley managed in three years work and using 1.2 million Golden silk orb-weavers (collected in the wild and released some 30 minutes later after they produced the silk) to produce a shawl that was exhibited at the American Museum of Natural History in 2009. By 2012 they managed to produce a second, bigger garment, a cape, that, together with the shawl, were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Another possible use of Nephila silk lies in tissue engineering. A study from the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover reports that processed Nephila silk is an excellent scaffold material thanks to its biocompatibility, mechanical strengths, and its property to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. In particular, the silk acts as a suitable guiding material for peripheral nerve regrowth. Fishermen on the coasts of the Indo-Pacific ocean remove Nephila webs and form them into a ball, which is thrown into the water. There it unfolds and is used to catch bait fish.

Such trusts are set up in an attempt to avoid or mitigate the effects of taxation, divorce and bankruptcy on the beneficiary. Such trusts are therefore frequently proscribed or limited in their effects by governments and the courts. The asset-protection trust is a trust that splits the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership. The beneficiaries of a trust are the beneficial owners of equitable interests in the trust assets, but they do not hold legal title to the assets. Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal of asset protection planning, i.e. to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion. A creditor's ability to satisfy a judgment against a beneficiary's interest in a trust is limited to the beneficiary's interest in such trust. Consequently, the common goal of asset protection trusts is to limit the interests of beneficiaries in such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against trust assets. Such trusts must be irrevocable (a revocable trust will not provide asset protection because and to the extent of the settlor's power to revoke). Most of them contain a spendthrift clause preventing a trust beneficiary from alienating his or her expected interest in favor of a creditor. The spendthrift clause has three general exceptions to the protection afforded: the self-settled trusts (if the settlor of a trust is also a beneficiary of a trust), the case when a debtor is the sole beneficiary and the sole trustee of a trust, and the support payments (a court may order the trustee to satisfy a beneficiary's support obligation to a former spouse or minor child). The first general exception, which accounts for the majority of asset protection trusts, no longer applies in several jurisdictions. The laws of certain jurisdictions including Alaska, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands allow self-settled trusts to afford their settlors the protection of the spendthrift clause. History of trusts Trusts were developed at common law in England originally to minimize the impact of inheritance taxes arising from transfers at death. The essence of the trust was to separate \\"legal\\" title, which was given to someone to hold as \\"trustee\\", from \\"equitable title\\", which was to be retained by the trust beneficiaries. In the United States and England, a practice developed whereby trust settlors began to use \\"spendthrift\\" clauses to prevent trust beneficiaries from alienating their beneficial interests to creditors. Over time, courts were asked to determine the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against the trust beneficiaries seeking to engage in such assignments, and the creditors of those beneficiaries seeking to reach trust assets. A case law doctrine developed whereby courts may generally recognize the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor. Domestic asset protection trust Alaska was the first US jurisdiction to enact laws allowing protection for self-settled trusts (in 1997) and was shortly followed by Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and a few others. These trusts are known as Domestic Asset Protection Trusts (DAPTs). Usually, a DAPT must comply with the following requirements: * the trust must be irrevocable and spendthrift; * at least one resident trustee must be appointed; * some administration of the trust must be conducted in respective state; * the settlor cannot act as a trustee. Trusts are generally governed by the laws of the jurisdiction that is designated by the settlor as the governing jurisdiction. There are two exceptions to the general rule, which may create conflicts of law: (i) states will not recognize laws of sister states that violate their own public policy, and (ii) if the trust owns real property, such property will be governed by the law of jurisdiction that is the property's situs. Additionally, the Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution provides that each state must give full faith and credit to the laws of every other state. This means that if a court from another state refuses to recognize the protection of a DAPT and enters a judgment for the creditor, the creditor may be able to enforce the judgment against the trustee of the DAPT, even if that trustee was located in the DAPT jurisdiction. The efficacy of a DAPT may also be challenged under the Supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, under the applicable fraudulent transfer statute, or because the settlor retained some prohibited control over the trust. These jurisdictions are also known as United States Asset Protection Trusts (USAPTs), from the point of view of the non-US settlors. The issues that would seem to apply on a USAPT established by a non-US settlor are: 1) whether a non-US court has jurisdiction over the USAPT; 2) the conflict of US versus non-US laws (i.e., which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the trust and the protection it purports to offer); 3) which fraudulent transfer law would apply; and 4) whether the US state court will recognize the non-US judgment. The context of a non-US settlor has a few advantages over that of a US settlor. The issue of the Full Faith and Credit clause doctrine of the US Constitution would not apply to a non-US settlor facing a non-US judgment. Creditors of non-US settlors would have to first obtain a judgment in their home jurisdiction and then attempt to enforce that \\"foreign\\" judgment in the US against the trustee of the USAPT, who was not a party to the original action. Therefore, except in unusual cases, this would mean that the only issues to litigate would be whether a fraudulent transfer has taken place, and in turn, which jurisdiction's fraudulent transfer laws would apply. Despite that, the non-US creditor must still seek to first have the foreign judgment recognized, because without formal legal acknowledgment of the judgment in the US court, there would be no basis on which to question the transfer. U.S. jurisdictions =South Dakota= South Dakota was one of the first states (1983) to allow a trust to endure perpetually, essentially jumping outside the onerous federal transfer (gift, estate and generation-skipping) tax system theoretically forever. Currently, twenty-four other states have joined the ranks of offering a long-term trust. Nineteen of these states, including South Dakota, allow a trust to continue in perpetuity. South Dakota does not impose any form of state taxation on the assets that comprise a trust located there. This includes, but is not limited to: no state income, capital gains, dividend/interest and/or intangible's taxes. Additionally, South Dakota has the lowest insurance premium tax of any state (i.e., 8 basis points or 8/100ths of 1%) and also offers other very favorable insurance legislation. South Dakota also has both excellent self-settled trust as well as third party discretionary trust statutes, both allowing for domestic asset protection planning with trusts. South Dakota is the first and only state in the US with a third party discretionary trust statute for asset protection, which states that a discretionary interest in third party trust, limited power of appointments, and remainder interests are not considered property interests. This statute is extremely important to properly asset protect trusts set up to benefit one's family. South Dakota also has some of the top-rated Asset Protection statutes for LLCs and LPs based upon a powerful \\"sole remedy charging order statute\\". Consequently, most of the unique and creative trust strategies for the wealthy involve trust administration in South Dakota without the necessity of having the trust's family reside there. Offshore jurisdictions The trust laws of the offshore world are typically founded on the trust laws of the onshore world. For those jurisdictions which are currently possessions of the UK, or were former possessions of the UK, typically the UK Trustee Act of 1925 is the common starting point. From there, each jurisdiction has sought to develop and evolve the law in a race to develop the most attractive trust environment which maintains acceptable standards, preserves the concepts of a trust, yet is attractive to potential users. Many of these jurisdictions share similar characteristics. =Bahamas= The Commonwealth of the Bahamas have traditionally been associated with offshore planning. However, the Bahamas are probably more noteworthy for offshore banking. The Bahamas do not recognize self-settled spendthrift trusts, unlike the Cook Islands, Nevis, or Belize. The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Bahamian Trust has a limitation period of two years, the same as Cook Islands. The quality of the banking and investment services is reasonable for the uses of a Trustee of an asset protection trust, however, the quality of the judiciary is considered low, as the legal profession is generally closed to the entry of non- Bahamians, and it is therefore difficult bring the knowledge of a specialised trust lawyer to the jurisdiction when needed. =Belize= Belize, offers immediate protection from court action initiated by creditors which challenges the settlor's transfer of property into the trust. However, due to the paucity of credible offshore banks in Belize, many trusts established in Belize hold assets with a second trustee or third-party financial institution in another country. =Bermuda= Bermuda, entry to follow =Cayman Islands= Cayman Islands trusts are governed principally by the Cayman Islands Trusts Law (2009 Revision), however elements of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 are relevant when considering the asset protection benefits of Cayman Trusts. A number of offshore jurisdictions have enacted modern asset protection legislation based on the Cayman Island's Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 (the \\"FDL\\").Cayman Islands Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 The Cayman Islands FDL states \\"Every disposition of property made with an intention to defraud, and at undervalue, shall be voidable at the insistence of an eligible creditor thereby prejudiced\\".STEP Diploma in International Trust Management Course Notes Module 11 The burden of proof is borne by the creditor applying to set aside the trust, and in the case of the Cayman Islands, the creditor/claimant must bring an action in the Cayman Islands courts (not in their home jurisdiction). The bar is set high for a potential claimant to successfully challenge a transfer. They must demonstrate an intention to defraud on behalf of the Settlor, and they must demonstrate they are an \\"eligible creditor\\" - meaning that at the date of the transfer, the transferor owes an obligation to the claimant. They must also be willing to bring an action in the Cayman Islands, which by itself is an expensive proposition. The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Cayman Trust has a limitation period of six years. In Cayman it is possible to register a trust as an Exempt Trust Cayman Trusts Law (2009 Revision - Part VI - Section 74(1)) however it is voluntary registration regime only, so most trusts remain unregistered. As most Cayman trusts are therefore private arrangements, it is hard to give exact figures for the popularity of AP Trusts governed by Cayman law. However the number of licensed trust companies give us some indication of how the jurisdiction is viewed. As of 30 September 2012 the Fiduciary Services Division of CIMA, the body responsible for licensing and regulating trust companies in the Cayman Islands has supervisory responsibility for 146 active trust licences.CIMA website: http://www.cimoney.com.ky/Stats_Reg_Ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=298 As the Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Dependent Territory, the quality of the judiciary is considered excellent, with the islands able to draw on the services of UK lawyers and solicitors when contentious cases arise and expert lawyers with appropriate experience are required. The quality of banking and investment services are reasonably good. =Cook Islands= The Cook Islands claims to be the first country to have enacted an explicit asset protection law, implementing particular provisions in 1989 to its International Trusts Act. Several of these changes have been adopted in one form or another in several other countries and a handful of a U.S. states. The most important of these changes permits the settlor of a trust to be named as a spendthrift beneficiary. The trust laws of the Cook Islands provide a shortened statute of limitations on fraudulent transfer claims. While most U.S. states have a four- year statute of limitations (and the Statute of Elizabeth in some common law jurisdictions has no statute of limitations), the general statute of limitations in the Cook Islands is reduced to two years for fraudulent transfers; in certain circumstances, it may be as short as one year. If the trust is funded while the settlor is solvent, then the transfer cannot be challenged.(i.e., there is no time period for the creditor to challenge the transfer) Several provisions of the Cook Islands law specify the form of pleading that a creditor must establish in order for its claim to be heard in a Cook Islands court. The effect of these provisions is to raise the burden of proof to \\"beyond a reasonable doubt,\\" something akin to a criminal law standard, in order for a creditor to establish a fraudulent transfer. The \\"constructive\\" fraudulent transfer theories are eliminated under Cook Islands law, requiring the creditor to prove that the transfer was made with specific intent to avoid the creditor's claim. It is believed that the Cook Islands now has more registered asset protection trusts than any other country, although in most jurisdictions a Trust is considered a private arrangement and it is not a requirement to register a Trust. Case law is somewhat lacking in the Cook Islands. However, some landmark decisions show that the Cook Islands Court intends to uphold the asset protection trust law. In 1999, the Federal Trade Commission attempted to recover assets from a Cook Islands Trust. The suit filed by the FTC against a trust company was unsuccessful. The quality of the judiciary and the associated banking and investment services offered from the Cook Islands are considered poor. =Nevis= Nevis was one of the first countries to follow the Cook Islands, duplicating an older version of the Cook Islands law and naming it the Nevis International Exempt Trust Ordinance, 1994. One distinguishing feature of the Nevis legislation is that a creditor must post a bond of ECB 25,000 (roughly USD 13,000) to lodge a complaint against a trust registered in Nevis. Very little case law exists in Nevis, which many attorneys interpret to mean that creditors are effectively deterred from bringing suit in Nevis. It has a small offshore banking industry, with St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Bank and Bank of Nevis International as the only licensed offshore banks. LLC legislation modeled after the Delaware LLC Act was passed in 1996. This has enabled Nevis to distinguish itself as a primary offshore jurisdiction for LLC formations, as opposed to other countries that are well known for IBC formations (British Virgin Islands) or trust formations (Cayman Islands). A Nevis LLC is often used in conjunction with an asset protection trust because it gives the creator of the trust direct control over the assets if the creator is listed as the manager of the Nevis LLC. This gives the creator added security in that it keeps the assets one step removed from the trustee of the asset protection trust. Because the managers and members of a Nevis LLC are not public information, the creator of the trust is able to assume control over the assets without disclosing his control on any public records. =Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey)= The Channel Islands have been long regarded as being the first jurisdictions to develop an offshore finance industry, each is often regarded as being one of the best quality jurisdictions to use. Fully compliant with anti money laundering laws, sharing taxation information with an increasing number of countries, modern case law indicate that creditors, who have a rightful claim, are able to freeze trust assets in the Channel Islands. Tax law initiatives in the UK have largely eliminated the tax advantages of UK citizens placing assets in trust in the Channel Islands, which in the early years had been a source of business. While the Channel Islands enjoys a modern banking sector, most attorneys do not regard the Channel Islands as appropriate for asset protection planning(why?). The judicial systems of the Channel Islands are split into two distinct Bailiwicks. The Bailiwick of Jersey, and the Bailiwick of Guernsey (which includes the islands of Guernsey, Alderney Sark, and Herm). The legal systems in each island follows a dual system based on Norman-French codified law overlaid with elements of English common law. Whilst specialised training is required in order to practice law in each of the Bailiwicks, the Bar is not open to everyone, the quality of the judiciary is generally considered very good, if not very expensive. Regulation of Fiduciary companies and the related banking and investment services offered in the Channel Islands is also considered good to excellent. =Switzerland and Liechtenstein= Switzerland and Liechtenstein are noteworthy for large banking sectors and sophisticated wealth management services. While both countries now recognize trusts (particularly trusts established under the laws of another jurisdiction, such as Nevis), there is no available case law yet which indicates how the courts of those two countries will enforce offshore asset protection trust laws. Many attorneys establish asset protection trusts under the laws of another country and deposit the trust assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. One question raised by this approach is whether a creditor can seize assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein without having to bring a claim in the trust-protective jurisdiction. Again, a lack of precedent suggests that this is an open issue in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Both countries are also known for offering asset protection annuities, with a six-month statute of limitations on fraudulent transfers into an annuity. Unfortunately for most Americans, these annuities cannot invest in US securities without punitive taxation due to the offshore status of the insurance carriers that offer these annuity products. Furthermore, many lawyers peddling these annuity products to their clients collect commissions from the insurance carriers. These reasons, among others, may help explain why annuities offered in these two countries are not particularly popular with U.S. persons. This does not mean that taxpayers of other jurisdictions may not significantly benefit from holding a Swiss or Liechtenstein annuity.A reference to: How Asset protection with Swiss/Liechtenstein annuity works Also, U.S. persons may benefit from holding an annuity issued by a carrier in an asset-protective jurisdiction (such as the Cook Islands), particularly if the carrier is an electing 953(d) carrier (a reference to a provision of US tax law).See Section 953(d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Challenges  Whether such a trust is a spendthrift trust on the U.S. model, a protective trust on the Commonwealth model or another form of discretionary trust, it is more likely to be subject to challenge under the common law doctrine of sham or under specific statutory provisions if any person setting up the trust (or their spouse and their spouse in turn as in a reciprocal trust): *can benefit under its provisions; *is the person under risk financially; *benefits (whether permitted or not) from the trust; or *if the person setting up the trust is at risk financially, if bankruptcy or divorce occurs soon after the establishment of the trust (fraudulent conveyance). Offshore trusts and other asset protection vehicles typically do not prevent action against the individual concerned in his or her home country. Orders under divorce and creditor protection laws can typically be made against that individual notwithstanding the alleged independence of such trustees. If a judge determines that the trust settlor controls the assets of the offshore trust, the judge may order the settlor to repatriate the trust assets. Failure to comply with the court's order may lead to a finding of contempt of court and imprisonment. For this reason, a properly established asset protection trust should provide a clear separation between the settlor and those who exercise control over the trust assets. = US v. Grant = The most recent case to rule on the merits of a contempt order is US v. Grant. In 2005, a federal district court in Miami ordered a domestic protector of an offshore asset protection trust, under threat of contempt, to exercise her power to replace the foreign trustee with a domestic trustee chosen by the court. The ruling, U.S. v. Grant Case No. 00-08986-Civ-Jordan (D.C. So. Fla. 2005), threatened to draw into question the viability of an asset-protection trust if a domestic protector could be compelled to appoint a domestic trustee to marshal the assets and bring them within the purview of the domestic court proceedings. In May 2008, the U.S. government sought to hold the domestic protector in contempt of court for failing to secure the cooperation of the foreign trustee to resign and repatriate the trust assets. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled against the government, finding that the domestic protector could not be held in contempt for failure to gain the cooperation of the offshore trustee. In denying the government's contempt motion, the judge observed: \\"I understand that it has been more than two years since the repatriation order was issued and that the funds had not yet been repatriated. But this failure is not for a lack of effort. I am reluctant to fault Mrs. Grant for her trustees' denial of her requests to repatriate the funds.\\" U.S. v. Grant, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51332, 101 A.F. T.R.2d (RIA) 2676 (D.C. So. Fla. 2008). For years, lawyers have vigorously debated the vulnerability of an asset protection trust with a domestic protector. The Grant case stands for the proposition that no vulnerability exists if the domestic protector complies with the court's orders. While a domestic protector may be required to make an effort to repatriate trust assets, failure to achieve repatriation should not entail any dire consequences to the trust or to the domestic protector. As long as a duress clause permits the foreign trustee to ignore the pleas of a domestic protector acting under threat of a contempt order, the selection of a domestic protector should not jeopardize the integrity of the offshore asset protection trust. While most attorneys draft trust agreements to limit the domestic protector's powers to those of a negative nature (i.e., the domestic protector may veto trustee decisions, but a domestic protector cannot order a trustee to do anything), the ruling in Grant implies that even positive powers exercisable by a domestic protector may not jeopardize an offshore asset protection trust containing a duress clause. Whether this leads attorneys to be more cavalier in their trust drafting remains to be seen. At least we know that traditional offshore asset protection trust planning works as anticipated.  Taxation  There are rigorous US tax reporting requirements that apply to taxpayers who establish offshore trusts. While no additional tax is usually imposed, certain forms of asset protection trusts require full disclosure of all trust assets and activities on the U.S. contributor's tax returns. Confidentiality is usually not enjoyed under these arrangements. Most asset protection trusts established by U.S. settlors are considered \\"grantor trusts\\" under U.S. income tax law, meaning that all income of the trust is reportable on the grantor's (i.e., the settlor's) individual income tax return. Asset-protection trusts do not, in and of themselves, offer any tax advantages under U.S. income tax law.

Military symbols applied to the CB agent fill, and not to the entire weapon. A chemical or biological weapon designation would be, for example, \\"Aero-14/B\\", which could be filled with GB, VX, TGB, or with a biological modification kit - OU, NU, UL, etc. A CB weapon is an integrated device of (1) agent, (2) dissemination means, and (3) delivery system. Military symbols evolved out of the First World War from the British in part for secrecy, and to simplify reference to chemicals by something other than a chemical name. These symbols were sometimes applied as marking on weapons to indicate the agent contents. Military symbols constantly changed and had transitory definitions. For example, mustard gas was assigned the military symbol originally HS for \\"Hun Stuff\\". Later in the First World War the S in HS signified mustard gas that had about 25% solvent added to it. This was only in England, as HS was adopted as the military symbol by the United States - signifying crude mustard. In the Second World War the purity of mustard gas was improved through distillation, and this purified chemical warfare agent was designated HD. When it was mixed with a thickener (Agent VV), it was given the symbol HV. Today mustard gas is indicated by the single capital letter H, but HD is still in common use. Military symbols can also reflect the name of where a chemical agent is manufactured. For example, chloropicrin has the symbol PS, which was derived from the British town in which it was manufactured during the First World War: Port Sunlight. Another device in assigning military symbols is in honor of the person that had devised the agent, such as Agent TZ (saxitoxin), which was derived after the name of its principal investigator, Dr. Edward Shantz. Numbers are occasionally added to military symbols to reflect particular preparations. With riot control agents a 1 signifies micropulverized (e.g., CS1), and a 2 signified microencapsulated (e.g., CS2). With biological agents a 1 signifies a wet-type agent (e.g., UL1), and a 2 signifies a dry-type agent (e.g., UL2). Binary chemical weapons are signified by adding a 2, as in binary sarin (i.e., GB2). Other formulations have their own designation. When the Tear Agent CS is formulated in a solvent it is signified by CSX. When agents are thickened with the addition of a polymer a T is usually added to the beginning of the symbol (e.g., thickened soman is TGD). The tear agent Mace, or Agent CN, had been formulated in several solvent forms, indicated by CNB (with benzene), CNC (with chloroform), and CNS (with chloropicrin and chloroform). Mixtures of agents have been identified with either a hyphen (e.g., CN-DM), or combining letters of the two agents (e.g., HD mixed with L is HL). Furthermore, one strain of the biological agent Tularemia has the symbol SR (lethal Schu strain), while another strain has JT (incapacitant 452 strain). Military symbols for agents change from time to time for administrative reasons as well. To preserve secrecy, tularemia's symbol UL1 and UL2 was changed to TT and ZZ at one time, and then later to SR. During the Second World War cyanogen chloride's symbol was changed from CK to CC, but when it became apparent that CC marked munitions might be mistaken for CG (phosgene), the symbol was changed back. The following designations are, or have been, used by the United States: Chemical agents =Blood agents= *AC - hydrogen cyanide *CK - cyanogen chloride *SA - Arsine =Choking agents= *BBC - bromobenzyl cyanide *CL - chlorine *CG - phosgene *DP - diphosgene *KJ - stannic chloride *NC -80% chloropicrin, 20% stannic chloride *PS - chloropicrin *Z - zyklon-B =Blister agents= *H - mustard gas *HD - distilled mustard gas *T - O-mustard *Q - sesquimustard *L - Lewisite *HL - mustard-lewisite mixture *HT - mustard-T mixture *HQ - mustard-Q mixture *HN - nitrogen mustard *ED - ethyl dichloroarsine *MD - methyl dichloroarsine *PD - phenyl dichloroarsine =Tear agents= *CA - camite *CN - mace *CNB - mace-benzene mixture *CNC - mace- chloroform mixture *CND *CNS - mace-chloropicrin-chloroform mixture *CS - CS gas *CS1 - micropulverized CS *CS2 - microencapsulated CS *CR - CR gas *CH - =Vomiting agents= *DA - diphenylchlorarsine *DC - diphenylcyanoarsine *DM - Adamsite =Psycho agents= *BZ - 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate *SN - sernyl (PCP) *K - lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [EA 1729] =Nerve Agents= *GA - tabun [EA1205] *GB - sarin [EA1208] *GB2 - sarin as a binary agent from mixing OPA (isopropyl alcohol+isopropyl amine) + DF [EA5823] *GD - soman [EA1210] *GF - cyclosarin [EA1212] *GE - ethyl sarin *GH - O-isopentyl sarin [EA1221] *GS - S-butyl sarin [EA1255] *GV - (dimethylaminoethyl phosphorodimethyl amidoylfluoridate) [EA5365] *VE - VE nerve agent [EA1517] *VG - Amiton (O,O-diethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothioate) [EA1508] *VM - Edemo [EA1664] *VS - (O-Ethyl S-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl ethylphosphonothiolate) [EA1677]Hoenig, Steven L.

He was a consort kin of Emperor Wu of Han as the younger half-brother of Emperor Wu's wife Empress Wei Zifu, and later the third husband of Emperor Wu's older sister Eldest Princess Yangxin. He was also the maternal uncle of Huo Qubing, another decorated Han general who participated in the war against the Xiongnu. Early life Wei Qing was born from humble means as an bastard child from a serf family. His father Zheng Ji (ÈÑ≠Â≠£) was a low-level official for Pingyang County (Âπ≥ÈôΩÁ∏£, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) and was commissioned to serve at the estate of Cao Shou (ÊõπÂ£Ω), the Marquess of Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ‰æØ), and his wife Princess Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩÂÖ¨‰∏ª, Emperor Wu's older sister). There, Zheng met and had an extramarital affair with a lowly female servant known as Wei Ao (Ë°õÂ™™, literally means \\"the Wei woman\\"), and their relationship produced a son named Zheng Qing. The child was initially sent to live in his father's household as his serf mother (who was already raising four other children) could not afford to raise him in poverty, but due to the illegitimacy of his birth, the young boy was detested and mistreated by his father and step-family, and was made to live as a lowly sheepherder. Unable to tolerate the abuse, Zheng Qing eventually ran away back to his mother's side during his early teenage years, and served as a stableboy in the marquess's estate of Pingyang. He then severed his paternal bond by adopting the surname \\"Wei\\" of his mother's family. Early career A gold- plated hill censer in Shaanxi History Museum. The inscriptions on it suggest that it was collected by Emperor Wu, later was bestowed to Wei Qing's wife, Eldest Princess Yangxin. Legend says that Wei Qing once followed his master on a visit to Ganquan Palace (ÁîòÊ≥âÂÆÆ) and encountered a cangued prisoner, who foretold that it would be Wei Qing's fate to achieve nobility and marquisate, a prediction Wei Qing simply dismissed as a joke, citing that not getting caned would be fortunate enough for someone living the life of a serf. After Princess Pingyang offered the singer Wei Zifu to Emperor Wu as a concubine c. 139 BC, Wei Qing followed as an accompanying gift and served as a horseman at Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Ááü, Emperor Wu's Royal Guards). However, as his sister gained the Emperor's love and fell pregnant, near-disaster would befall Wei Qing. The powerful Grand Princess Guantao (È§®Èô∂Èï∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ª) Liu Piao (ÂäâÂ´ñ), the mother of Empress Chen Jiao, angry that Wei Zifu had siphoned off the imperial favor from her daughter, kidnapped Wei Qing and wanted to kill him privately as retaliation. However, Wei was rescued at the last moment by his friends, a group of fellow palace guards led by Gongsun Ao (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Êïñ). In response to the incident and as a sign of annoyance towards Empress Chen and her mother, Emperor Wu appointed Wei Qing the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Áõ£, equivalent to a chief security officer), Chief of Staff (‰æç‰∏≠) and Chief Councillor (Â§™‰∏≠Â§ßÂ§´), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants. He also publicly made Wei Zifu a consort (Â§´‰∫∫, a concubine position lower only to the Empress), and rewarded other members of her family. This marked the beginning of the rise of one of the most influential clan in the political history of Western Han ‚Äì the Wei/Huo family. Great wealth would not be all Wei Qing would have. Emperor Wu saw qualities in him ‚Äì brilliant horsemanship, archery, bravery, outstanding tactical intuition as well as excellent leadership skills. Over the next several years, Wei Qing would be entrusted as Emperor Wu's most loyal consul, as his sister also monopolized the Emperor's love for the next decade. Military campaigns Expansion of Han dynasty. Wei Qing's campaigns against Xiongnu is shown in red arrows. In 129 BC, Xiongnu attacked the Shanggu Commandery (‰∏äË∞∑ÈÉ°, roughly modern-day Zhangjiakou, Hebei). Emperor Wu promoted Wei Qing as the General of Chariots and Cavalry (ËªäÈ®éÂ∞áËªç) and dispatched him with Gongsun Ao, Gongsun He (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Ë≥Ä), and Li Guang in four separate columns against Xiongnu, each leading 10,000 cavalry. Li Guang (the most seasoned commander out of the four) and Gongsun Ao suffered major losses at the Xiongnu's hand, while Gongsun He failed to encounter and engage any enemy. Wei Qing, the least experienced out of the four, distinguished himself with a successful long-distance raid of the Xiongnu's holy site Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé), killing over 700 Xiongnu soldiers in the process. As a reward for the victory (the first proper victory against Xiongnu in Han history), Wei Qing was promoted to a higher command and created an acting Marquess of Guannei (ÈóúÂÖß‰æØ), with a march of several hundred households. In 128 BC, Consort Wei Zifu gave birth to Emperor Wu's first son, Liu Ju, and was created Empress very soon after. Later that year, Wei Qing, who was now officially a trusted member of Emperor's extended family, led 30,000 cavalry from Shanwu (near present-day Youyuxian, Shanxi) in Yanmen Commandery, killing thousands of Xiongnu soldiers. In 127 BC, Wei Qing led a 40,000-strong cavalry from Yunzhong Commandery (Èõ≤‰∏≠ÈÉ°, modern-day Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia), then maneuver to Gaoque (È´òÈóï, modern-day Urad Rear Banner) to Longxi region (modern-day Gansu), and totally outflanking and surrounding the forces of Xiongnu's Princes of Loufan (Ê®ìÁÖ©Áéã) and Baiyang (ÁôΩÁæäÁéã), killing 2,300 and capturing 3,017 Xiongnu soldiers as well as over a million cattle. According to record from Shiji and Hanshu, the battle was so swift and one-sided that the Han forces \\"returned with all warriors intact\\" (ÂÖ®Áî≤ÂÖµËÄåÈÇÑ), implying a near-zero casualty rate. This earned Wei Qing a further promotion to the Marquess of Changping (Èï∑Âπ≥‰æØ), with a march of 3,800 households. His subordinates Su Jian (ËòáÂª∫, father of the great Han patriot Su Wu) and Zhang Cigong (ÂºµÊ¨°ÂÖ¨) were also created marquesses. The Han recapture of this territory forced the two Xiongnu tribes to withdraw from the fertile Hetao region (the Ordos steppe), and dealt devastating blow to their economy. The city of Shuofang (ÊúîÊñπÂüé) was built, and later became a key stronghold for offensive and defensive campaigns against Xiongnu. In 124 BC, Wei Qing would be the vital part of the greatest Han victory over Xiongnu to date. When Xiongnu's Right Worthy Prince (Âè≥Ë≥¢Áéã) made harassing raids against outskirts of Shuofang, Wei Qing launched a crushing long-distance night assault from Gaoque with 30,000 cavalrymen, completely surprising and surrounding the Worthy Prince's main camp. Not only did the Han forces send the Worthy Prince running for his life from his drunken slumber (with only his own concubine following), they also took about 15,000 captives, among them a dozen Xiongnu nobles, and millions of cattle. For this victory, Wei Qing was made the \\"Grand General\\" (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç) of All Armed Forces, and his march was enlarged by 8,700 households. His three young sons Wei Kang (Ë°õ‰ºâ), Wei Buyi (Ë°õ‰∏çÁñë), and Wei Deng (Ë°õÁôª) were also made marquesses (an offer later refused by Wei Qing), as well as seven generals under his command. In 123 BC, Wei Qing set off from Dingxiang (ÂÆöË•Ñ) and returned with several thousand enemy kills. A month later, Wei Qing again launched from Dingxiang, but would fight a relatively inconclusive battle. Although he was able to kill/capture more than 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers, part of his vanguard forces, a 3,000-strong regiment commanded by generals Su Jian and Zhao Xin (a surrendered Xiongnu prince), encountered a Xiongnu force led by Chanyu Yizhixie (‰ºäÁ®öÊñúÂñÆ‰∫é), and was outnumbered and annihilated. Zhao Xin defected on the field with his 800 ethnic Xiongnu subordinates, while Su Jian escaped after losing all his men in the desperate fighting. Showing compassion on Su Jian, Wei Qing spared him even though some advocates advised him to execute Su on the spot after court martial to enforce his commanding authority. Due to the loss of Su's detachment, Wei Qing troops did not earn any promotion, even though they scored more gains than losses. At this campaign, his nephew Huo Qubing distinguished himself in battle and was given his own command.  The Battle of Mobei  After Huo Qubing's successful campaigns in the Hexi Corridor, Xiongnu strategically retreated to north of the Gobi Desert, as the barren lands would serve as a natural barrier that was very difficult to overcome for the Han forces. However, in 119 BC, Emperor Wu decided to defy the odds and launched a massive expeditionary campaign across the desert. In this engagement, Emperor Wu broke the normal pattern of reaction against Xiongnu attacks by making a major excursion against Xiongnu's headquarters in the north of the Gobi Desert. This is known to history as the Mobei Campaign (\\"campaign of the desert's north\\"). Wei Qing and Huo Qubing were in command of the two main corps, each with 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 infantrymen/charioteers. Under Wei Qing's command were four other generals, namely Gongsun He, Zhao Yiji (Ë∂ôÈ£üÂÖ∂), Cao Xiang (ÊõπË•Ñ) and an elderly but very enthusiastic Li Guang. Contrary to the arrangements promised to Li Guang by Emperor Wu (where he would command the vanguard), Emperor Wu secretly told Wei Qing not to assign Li Guang to crucial missions due to Li's infamous history of \\"bad lucks\\". Wei Qing, after the army had already departed, merged Li Guang's forces with Zhao Yiji's and ordered them to take an eastern flanking route through a barren region. According to the historian Sima Qian, Wei Qing had done this to give his old friend Gongsun Ao, who had recently been stripped of his title, a chance to win a major battle and be re-promoted. However, sending Generals of Front (ÂâçÂ∞áËªç, namely Li Guang) and Right (Âè≥Â∞áËªç, namely Zhao Yiji) on flanking maneuvers was one of Wei Qing's typical tactical arrangements. This was evidenced by his previous deployment of Zhao Xin and Su Jian, who were Generals of Front and Right respectively, during the less successful 123 BC campaign. After crossing the desert, Wei Qing's army unexpectedly encountered Chanyu Yizhixie's main forces, who was waiting in anticipation of ambushing the Han army. Despite being significantly outnumbered as well as fatigued after the long journey, Wei Qing was able to counter Xiongnu's cavalry charge with archery defense created by heavy-armored chariots arranged in ring formations, which was reinforced with cavalry counteroffensives. (This defense would be evaluated as one of the most effective against cavalry by many later Chinese tacticians, including Yue Fei.) The Han forces successfully enforced a stalemate that lasted until dusk, when a sandstorm descended upon the battlefield. Seizing the moment of poor visibility provided by the dust, Wei Qing broke the stalemate and launched bilateral flanking attacks with his cavalries. Already exhausted after a day of unsuccessful attacks against Han positions, the sudden sight of incoming Han soldiers in the darkness further broke the Xiongnu's morale, routing them. This decisive pincer attack shattered the Chanyu's line, nearly capturing him and completely overrunning his forces, killing over 10,000 Xiongnu soldiers in the process. The Han army pursued all the way to the modern Ulan Bator region, destroying the Xiongnu stronghold Zhao Xin Castle (Ë∂ô‰ø°Âüé) before returning in triumph with a total of about 19,000 enemy kills. Chanyu Yizhixie was forced to escape with very few men, lost communication with his tribe for days, and did not return until his clan presumed his death and installed a new Chanyu. This was a narrow but critically significant victory for the Han empire. Xiongnu was greatly weakened to the point that they would huddle up into the barren northern Gobi desert (leading to decline of their population), and unable to raid south for the next decade. The next major Xiongnu invasion did not occur until after the Han dynasty collapsed, some 400 years later during the Jin Dynasty. = Li Gan incident = While Wei Qing's main force was engaging Yizhixie Chanyu, the flanking division led by Li Guang and Zhao Yiji got lost in the desert and failed to reach the battlefield in time, despite meeting little Xiongnu resistance. They only rendezvous with Wei Qing's troops after the latter already returned from Zhao Xin Castle. Both men were later summoned for court martial to explain the failure to accomplish orders and thus jeopardize the whole campaign. Feeling humiliated over the charges against him and frustrated over missing his final chance at martial glory, Li Guang committed honor suicide rather than to face the court. Many people, including the historian Sima Qian, thus blamed Wei Qing for causing Li Guang's death. Li's youngest son Li Gan (ÊùéÊï¢), who was a subordinate of Huo Qubing at the time, later went to Wei Qing's home and assaulted him. Although Wei Qing decided to cool the heat and mercifully let the matter slide, Huo Qubing was greatly angered that his subordinate had the temerity to insult his uncle. He personally shot dead Li Gan during a hunting trip.  Late career and death  Tomb of Wei Qing in Xingping, Shaanxi After the 119 BC campaign, Wei Qing would see little combat action himself, largely remaining in the capital Chang'an to advise on military and sometimes political matters as the dual- role of Chief Defense Minister/Generalissimo (Â§ßÂè∏È¶¨Â§ßÂ∞áËªç). He also assisted his nephew, Crown prince-regent Liu Ju, when Emperor Wu was away on official tours. Despite his great honor and power, Wei Qing remained humble in many ways. Because of the great favor Emperor Wu showed him, all of the other officials at court flattered him, except for Ji An (Ê±≤ÈªØ), who treated him as an equal. Wei was impressed by Ji's integrity in face of pressure and respected Ji greatly, often requesting Ji's opinion on important matters. Throughout his career, he refused to hire scholars to praise him and create favorable public opinions, and tried to maintain a relatively low profile. Despite his humble way of life, Wei's status in the Han army made him a distinguished figure in the country, attracting admiration, jealousy and hostility alike. Emperor Wu's uncle, the Prince of Huainan Liu An, who had been conspiring a military coup for a long time, saw Wei Qing as his prime political obstacle that must be removed. Wei Qing died in 106 BC and was buried in a large tomb built to the model of Mount Lu (ÁõßÂ±±, a mountain previously in Xiongnu-occupied territory). The tomb was connected to that of his nephew Huo Qubing, who had died in 117 BC, and the future tomb for Emperor Wu. Wei Qing would not live to see the destruction of his clan ‚Äì nobody survived except his youngest son Wei Deng (Ë°õÁôª) and his great grandnephew Liu Bingyi, as well as the tragic fate of his sister Empress Wei and nephew Liu Ju, during the political turmoil in 91 BC.

He was head coach of the University of New Mexico Lobo basketball team from 1972 to 1979, winning Western Athletic Conference championships in 1974 and 1978 and compiling an overall record of 134‚Äì62 (.684). His former players included future National Basketball Association (NBA) defensive stand-out Michael Cooper, who helped lead the 1977‚Äì78 team that was ranked as high as No. 5 nationally. Ellenberger was dismissed as Lobo head coach due to a recruiting scandal known as \\"Lobogate\\". Ellenberger later became lead assistant coach under Don Haskins at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) from 1986 to 1990 and under Bobby Knight at Indiana University from 1990 to 2000. He served as an assistant for the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 2000 to 2003 and then coached boys' and girls' high school basketball in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He was an assistant for the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) during the 2012‚Äì13 season before returning to high school coaching in Michigan. Early career Ellenberger graduated in 1955 from Butler University, where he played for basketball coaching legend Tony Hinkle. Ellenberger was also captain and all-conference player on the football team, and he pitched a no-hitter on the baseball team. In 2012, he was inducted into the Butler Athletic Hall of Fame.Norm Ellenberger Bio , Butler Athletic Hall of Fame , Butlersports.com. After a brief stint in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, he taught science and coached basketball and other sports from 1957 to 1964 at New Haven High, near the Indiana farm where he grew up.Bobbi Roquemore, Ellenberger enjoys the simple life, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feb. 25, 2004.K.C. Johnson, Why does Ellenberger coach? It's \\"what I do\\", Chicago Tribune, May 09, 2001. In 1964 Ellenberger began coaching at Monmouth College in western Illinois, where he led the football, basketball, and baseball teams at one point. His basketball teams compiled a record of 30‚Äì36, including a 14‚Äì8 campaign in 1965‚Äì66.Monmouth College Men's Basketball Record Book, pp.2-3. New Mexico On April 13, 1967, Ellenberger was hired as lead assistant by head coach Bob King at the University of New Mexico. Under King, the Lobos had run a highly methodical offense, controlling game tempo by emphasizing defense.Richard Stevens, Ellenberger, Colson Find Good Times, Bad Times, With Lobos, New Mexico Official Athletics Site, June 13, 2013. King gave Ellenberger leeway to open up the offense with a more balanced attack.Mark Smith, Lobos went Stormin‚Äô with Norman, Albuquerque Journal, June 23, 2013. Despite losing key players to graduation, the 1967‚Äì68 Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship and made the first NCAA Tournament appearance in school history.New Mexico Lobo Basketball 2013-14 Media Guide, p.114. In March 1972, King was named assistant athletic director, and Ellenberger was promoted to head coach. King left the following year to become athletic director and later head coach at Indiana State University.Media Guide 2013-14, p.96. Under Ellenberger, the Lobos won WAC championships in 1974 and 1978 and compiled an overall record of 134‚Äì62 (.684).Media Guide 2013-14, p.130. The team's success, along with his energy and enthusiasm, made Ellenberger highly popular among Lobo fans. He became a local celebrity in Albuquerque, a restaurateur and man-about-town, earning the nickname \\"Stormin' Norman\\" for his flashy attire, fiery coaching style, and flamboyant personality.Lee Benson, This is Just Norm-al for the Miners, Deseret News, March 11, 1989. The Lobos were frequently ranked among the top 25 in the nation under Ellenberger, and attendance for Lobo games at The Pit was regularly among the top four in college basketball.Media Guide 2013-14, pp.4,84. The 1973‚Äì74 team won the WAC championship and became the first Lobo squad to win an NCAA tournament game. The 1977‚Äì78 team was his best at New Mexico, led by Michael Cooper, who went on to become one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history. The Lobos were ranked for most of the season, peaking at No. 5, winning the WAC championship, and reaching the NCAA tournament. Ellenberger was voted runner-up for the US Basketball Writers Coach of the Year award.Media Guide 2013-14, p.86. The turning point in Ellenberger's career came with the \\"Lobogate\\" recruiting scandal, involving forged academic transcripts, payments made for bogus Junior College credits, and other devices to attain eligibility for players who lacked academic credentials.William C. Dowling, Confessions of a Spoilsport: My Life and Hard Times Fighting Sports Corruption at an Old Eastern University (2007), pp.13,19-26. In an investigation into illegal gambling, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had placed a wiretap on the phone of a major Lobo booster. While Ellenberger was visiting this booster, in November 1979, he took a call on the tapped phone from an assistant coach. They discussed an arrangement to transfer bogus credits from a California Junior College to the office of the UNM registrar. Based on this conversation, the FBI launched an investigation into the recruiting activities of Lobo coaches. Ellenberger was fired on December 17, 1979. The investigation led to a federal indictment of Ellenberger on seven counts of fraud and forgery of academic transcripts, but he was acquitted of those charges at trial.Dowling (2007), p.26. In July 1981, however, he was convicted by a state District Court on 21 of 22 counts of fraud and submitting false public vouchers. The judge deferred sentence, placing Ellenberger on unsupervised probation for a year, and all counts were formally dismissed in 1983.Dave Anderson, Sports of the Times; in The Pit, Lobogate Lives, N.Y. Times, Apr. 3, 1983. The NCAA investigation into the scandal found 34 violations of recruiting rules, and the Lobo program was placed on probation and banned from post-season appearances for three years.Mark Smith, Lobogate Destroyed Basketball Program in '79, Sept. 15, 2007. Later career Despite the scandal, Ellenberger remained popular with many Lobo fans. He continued to live in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he owned a restaurant, appeared in TV commercials, coached the city's Continental Basketball Association team and a women's professional team, and continued to attend Lobo games. Some fans felt he had been unfairly dismissed and even wanted him to be rehired as coach of the Lobos.Curt Holbreich, Lobos Going From Pit Toward the Penthouse, L.A. Times, Jan. 14, 1988. His ability as a basketball coach had never been in question, and in 1986, former rival and longtime friend Don Haskins hired Ellenberger as his lead assistant at University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), where he coached for four years, even serving as interim head coach for one season while Haskins was side-lined due to health problems. Another longtime friend, Bobby Knight, hired Ellenberger as his lead assistant at Indiana University, where he coached for ten seasons, from 1990 to 2000.Mark Smith, Give Him Liberty, Albuquerque Journal, Apr. 1, 2012. Ellenberger spent the following three seasons as an assistant to Tim Floyd with the Chicago Bulls of the NBA. While in Chicago, Ellenberger became enamored with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and bought a lakeside cabin near Watersmeet. In 2003, he accepted a position as head coach of the girls' basketball team at Lakeland Union High School in nearby Minocqua, Wisconsin, leaving at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 school year. He then coached at the Conserve School in Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin. In 2009, he became assistant coach at Northland Pines High School in Eagle River, Wisconsin. He won Coach of the Year in three different districts during those years, and in 2011‚Äì12 he led the Watersmeet Lady Nimrods to the Porcupine Mountain Conference title. Later in 2012, he became an assistant coach for the New York Liberty of the WNBA. He then returned to Watersmeet and coached the Lady Nimrods through the 2014‚Äì15 season.See Jason Juno, Nimrods' season ended by Forest Park, The Daily Globe (Ironwood, MI), March 5, 2015. He had signed as an assistant coach at another high school nearby just before his death.Mark Smith, Former Lobo basketball coach Norm Ellenberger dies, Albuquerque Journal, November 15, 2015. His love of basketball led him to continue coaching, but he had a similar passion for the outdoors, regularly fishing, canoeing, and chopping wood at his lake shore cabin. Ellenberger can be seen briefly in the 1994 movie, Blue Chips, squatting in a timeout huddle next to Bobby Knight. He also appears in an episode of the 2007 documentary series, Nimrod Nation, aired on the Sundance Channel, as an assistant coach for the Watersmeet Nimrods, the subject of the series.

Nast transformed it into a magazine about interior design, as part of his trend toward specialized publications aimed at niche markets. = UK edition= A UK edition was originally planned to be launched in the late 1930s, but was cancelled due to World War II. The magazine was finally published in February 1947, although paper restrictions meant that there were only seven pages in colour and, until 1952, just four editions each year. The founding editor was Anthony Hunt, followed by Michael Middleton, before Robert Harling took over for a 36-year tenure between 1957 and 1993.Freyberg, Annabel (8 June 1997).Sofa so good for H&G;'s first 50 years The Independent Harling was succeeded by Sue Crewe, who edited the magazine until September 2014 when she moved to the Conde Nast website House,Reynolds, John (12 March 2014).

Harling appointed a staff of 18, which included Leonie Highton, and later John Bridges, and three advisers: Elizabeth David (on food), Loelia, Duchess of Westminster (to discover unknown houses), and Olive Sullivan (on interior design). Harling revitalised House & Garden, and produced a magazine which contrasted the ancient and modern, with colour and simplicity. Besides the magazine, he launched a series of books on the same theme, starting in 1959 with House & Garden Interiors and Colour. Ten more books followed, his last contributions being the House & Garden Book of Romantic Rooms (1985), and House & Garden Book of Classic Rooms (1989); in 1980 with Miles Hadfield he published British Gardeners: a biographical dictionary - this being a reworking of Pioneers in Gardening a book which he had developed with Miles Hadfield and Leonie Highton thirty five years earlier.

In 1970, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honor, \\"for his contribution to the opening of the Canadian North through his inventions and development of various types of tracked vehicles\\". A mountain in Antarctica \\"Nodwell Peaks\\" and a lake in NWT bear his name. Early life William Bruce Nodwell was born on his father's homestead near Asquith, Saskatchewan, May 12, 1914. His unusual birth certificate read Section 22, Township 36, Range 9 west 3rd. As a youngster, his family lived in many small western Canadian towns, as his father was a grain elevator operator and trainer. They returned to Asquith, where his father ran a hardware store and later a Dodge car dealership in North Battleford. During this time, Bruce learned hands-on carpentry, electrical and mechanical machinery operations. Although he only took Grade 8 in school, he studied electrical apprenticeship by correspondence and became Saskatchewan's youngest registered electrician. However, this was the time of the Great Depression in western Canada. Crops were drying out, prices for grain were low, farmers were being forced off the land, businesses were failing and there were next to no jobs. Bruce started doing odd jobs using his practical skills and hard work. He ran a two or three person contracting operation that took work wherever they could find it, which included all of southern Saskatchewan and Alberta. In 1936, he and his wife Phyllis settled in Calgary, Alberta where he and his brother, Jack, formed a contracting company known as Nodwell Brothers. During the Depression and WWII years, not only were jobs hard to find, but so were materials. The government imposed a cost ceiling of $10,000 on all new buildings. This also applied to service stations, which made it very difficult to construct a building big enough to repair trucks and tractors or car dealerships. In order to construct a new building, another would have to be taken down, just to obtain nails, which then had to be straightened by hand. Inventive genius Bruce's inventiveness and problem solving skills soon became apparent. He developed and patented an automatic rewinding mechanism for gasoline pumps (CA 454365) and a pipe-wrapping machine for coating pipelines with tar paper in the field. Many problems related to construction work were solved by adapting other available equipment. Gradually the company continued to grow and diversify its activities including concrete bridges, trucking fleet, industrial camps and a machine shop known as Industrial Fabricators. Over the years, Bruce filed nine patents in Canada. Development of early tracked vehicles A Nodwell 110 equipped with a water tank for fire suppression In 1947, Imperial Oil made the Leduc No. 1 discovery in Alberta, and the economy began to rapidly expand. As the oil exploration moved northward from the Leduc region, the oil men soon encountered muskeg, a wet boggy swamp-like matter through which conventional equipment could not pass. Even WWII tracked equipment either could not handle the requirement or did not have sufficient load capacities. Imperial Oil asked Bruce Nodwell to construct two vehicles they had designed to try to provide mobility over muskeg. These vehicles were unsuccessful, but Bruce had become aware of the need for large tracked vehicles. His first designs, that were to be either tracked or wheeled, were called North Kings and 16 were sold, but even they did not have enough mobility or durability. Bruce then concentrated on a vehicle design using soft tracks and single rows of wheels to support them. In 1955, Bruce's invention of the double sprocket made it possible to drive wide tracks and also keep them in place while using a single row of wheels. The combination of the splice in the belt and the double sprocket allowed the use of any size or shape belt the vehicles needed. The \\"wide track\\" concept was born. They were now able to build a new and different type of machine. The first of these was a small 1-ton-capacity vehicle called the Scout Car. However, the oil industry need a larger capacity in order to transport the geophysical \\"seismic\\" drilling rigs. Bruce's next step was to build a tracked trailer, since a method of steering a large vehicle had yet to be located. The powered trailer had tracks 40 inches wide, its own engine, and could carry a five-ton load through muskeg. Although it had its own power, it was navigated by the smaller Scout Car, which was attached to its front hitch. Imperial Oil, responding to this breakthrough in muskeg vehicles, bought 30 powered tracked trailers and 30 Scout Cars. The company, Bruce Nodwell Ltd., then began working on designing improvements to the powered trailer so that it would be a self-sufficient unit. The successful trailer was to be modified to include a cab and a steering differential device to make it into a self operating vehicle. Eventually, after a few unsuccessful attempts at finding or building a steering mechanism, the problem was solved by modifying an Oliver Tractor steering differential. The new vehicle was first called the Tracked Truck. However, everyone in the industry knew Bruce, because of his close contact with existing and potential customers, so they called the vehicle the \\"Nodwell\\". Later, the vehicle became known as the Nodwell 110, indicating its payload in 100-pound units. Even though the Model 110 was now proving to be a more successful operating unit, the Canadian marketplace was reluctant to purchase many Nodwell vehicles due to memories of past failures. For a while it became necessary for the company to try another market, making their first major sale to Western Geophysical in Alaska. This sale consisted of a complete geophysical crew, including five drill carriers, two recorders, a mechanics shop, kitchen unit and crew quarters, all mounted on the Model 110 vehicles. This crew operated successfully in severe muskeg conditions, spreading the reputation of the Model 110 throughout the geophysical industry both in Canada and Alaska. This model became the standard for geophysical work in the muskeg country of Northern Canada and Alaska. The Nodwell 110 was ultimately so successful that over 1,500 vehicles of this style were manufactured by the industry. Several Nodwell vehicles were delivered to the US Antarctic Research Organization and in 1961 a Place-Name survey group named a mountain in the Antarctic Peninsula Nodwell Peaks. Diversification of products and worldwide markets As Bruce expanded the applications and product line, additional financing was required and he used a number of different companies including, North King Equipment Ltd., Bruce Nodwell Ltd. and in 1958, Robin-Nodwell Ltd. Bruce left Robin-Nodwell in 1965 to join his son, Jack Nodwell, in a new company, Foremost Industries. Foremost, over the years expanded the product lines to encompass both tracked and large-tired vehicles with load capacities from 5 to 70 tonnes. The company pursued international markets throughout the world, with its major success being in the USSR and Russia where over 700 vehicles with load capacities of 30 tonnes were delivered. In 1976 Foremost Industries recovered the trade name \\"Nodwell\\" when its rival folded. Recognitions In 1970, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honor, \\"for his contribution to the opening of the Canadian North through his inventions and development of various types of tracked vehicles\\". A mountain in Antarctica \\"Nodwell Peaks\\" was named in recognition of the vehicles in use by the various Antarctica Research institutions. A large lake in Canada's North West Territories is called Nodwell Lake (Lat 67.4539, Long -135.3115). During the early days of geophysical exploration in the north, the Nodwell vehicles were often sent out onto lakes once the ice was believed to be strong enough. The tracks in the snow would speed further freezing for other equipment. A Nodwell 110 fell through the ice of this lake and from then on it was known as Nodwell Lake. The crew was able to quickly exit out of the \\"Escape Hatch\\" on the roof that was standard equipment. Canada Post issued a special stamp series in 1996 called Historic Land Vehicles. The Robin-Nodwell RN 110 is illustrated on an 88 cent stamp.

He was awarded Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1969, Ekushey Padak in 1983 and Independence Day Award in 1998. Early life and education Kaiser was born in the Mazupur village (in present-day Feni District) as Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah. He studied at Presidency College, Kolkata and obtained a bachelor's degree in economics with honours. Later, he enrolled in master's of arts at Calcutta University but did not complete the degree. Family Kaiser's wife, Panna Kaiser, is an author and novelist. She served as a member of the parliament for the Awami League government from 1996 to 2001. Kaiser's daughter, Shomi Kaiser, is a television actress. His son, Amitav Kaiser, is a banker. Politics and journalism Kaiser was active in politics and cultural movements from his student days. Following the formation of Pakistan in 1947, he joined the provincial Communist Party of East Pakistan. He started working as a journalist in 1949 with the Ittefaq in Dhaka. In 1952, he participated actively in the Language Movement. For his political role in the movement for protection of Bengali language, Kaiser was arrested on 3 June 1952. He was later jailed for three and a half years. Right after his release in 1955, he was again arrested and jailed on a political crackdown on activists. A few years later he was released. In 1958, Kaiser joined as an associate editor of The Sangbad ‚Äì a Bengali language daily ‚Äì where he worked for the rest of his life. When the military coup of 1958 put Ayub Khan in power, and martial law was proclaimed, Kaiser was arrested again on 14 October 1958 and remained in jail for four years till his release in September 1962. Disappearance Kaiser collected medicine and food and delivered those to the posts such as one being Begum Sufia kamal's house, from where the freedom fighters picked those up for their training outpost. At the end the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, the Pakistan Army and its local collaborators initiated a plan for killing the leading Bengali intellectuals. As a part of it, Kaiser was rounded up on 14 December 1971. He never returned, nor was his body ever found. It is assumed that he was executed along with other intellectuals. His brother, Zahir Raihan, a notable film-maker, also disappeared while searching for Kaiser. In early December 1971, Kaiser cautioned Sufia Kamal to leave Dhaka but he himself did not leave and got caught in the hand of the Pakistani Army. On 3 November 2013, Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, a Muslim leader based in London, and Ashrafuz Zaman Khan, based in the United States, were sentenced in absentia after the court found that they were involved in the abduction and murders of 18 people ‚Äì nine Dhaka University teachers, six journalists including Kaiser and three physicians ‚Äì in December 1971. Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin denied the charges in an interview aired by Al Jazeera in August 2013.

She ran as a Republican, but grew disillusioned with the party and later joined the American Heritage Party, the Washington State affiliate of the Constitution Party. She resided in Poulsbo, Washington with her husband and fellow politician, Bruce Craswell. Early life Ellen Howe was born in Bothell, Washington on May 25, 1932 and grew up in Silverdale, Washington, the fifth child in a household of seven children. Her father died when she was nine years old and her mother raised the family. Career Craswell was elected to Washington's 23rd Legislative District in 1976. She received 33.69% of the vote against two Democrats in the 1976 primary, before going on to defeat Democrat Ray Aardal, with 54.63% of the vote. She won landslides in both 1978 and 1980, when she became a member of the Washington State Senate. From 1984 and onwards, she faced a series of competitive races. She narrowly won re- election after a recount in 1988 and was defeated by Democrat Betti Sheldon in 1992. During her tenure as a senator, she earned the nickname \\"Senator No\\" for her steady refusal to vote for any tax increases. In 1987 she was appointed as the first female president pro tempore of the Senate, a position she held until the end of her career. =1996 Washington gubernatorial election= After Democrat Mike Lowry announced that he would not seek re-election, Craswell announced that she would run. During her legislative career, she was initially identified as a Ronald Reagan supporter, but as time went on, she gained a strong identity as an evangelical Christian and member of the Christian right. Craswell was very open about her religious identity, prompting concern among some in the Republican Party that she would have difficulty in moderately liberal Washington. During the campaign, Craswell successfully appealed to suburban conservatives with more moderate social leanings by promising to repeal more than a third of state taxes and cut 30 percent of the state budget. In September 1996, she narrowly gained the primary nod, receiving 15.26% of the primary vote and defeating her nearest Republican opponent Dale Foreman, who received 13.37%. Craswell campaigned both on fiscal issues and as an unabashed conservative Christian. She gained media coverage for comments, including those where she described herself as a \\"radical,\\" declared that she would hire only \\"wise and godly people\\" as staffers, and listed God at the top of her campaign organization chart. Education also became an important issue during the campaign, with Craswell supporting heavy localization and a tuition-based system for all schools, and Democratic opponent Gary Locke supporting a more state-centric system. Craswell successfully ran a grassroots campaign, receiving campaign contributions from only individuals and advertising only on billboards and yard signs and at campaign events. Craswell's outspoken position on social issues - including comments that gay rights were \\"special rights for sodomites\\" - did not resonate with voters in the state. In November, Craswell was defeated by Locke, receiving only 42.04% of the vote. =Subsequent activity= Following her defeat in the election, Craswell switched party affiliation to the Christian right American Heritage Party (AHP). Her husband, Bruce, ran under the party's banner in the 1st congressional district and received 6.11%. When the AHP (then a state affiliate of the Constitution Party) attempted to disaffiliate from the national party (CP), it caused an acrimonious schism resulting in non-renewal by over 90 percent of the state party members. The Craswells left both the American Heritage Party and the Constitution Party and became independents.  Personal life  In 1955, she married Bruce Craswell, a dentist who she had met in college.

Jurij Moskvitin accompanying Karen Blixen at her meeting with Igor Stravinsky at the Copenhagen City Hall, 1959 Jurij Moskvitin grew up in Denmark; his mother a Russian aristocrat and his father was a Danish civil engineer. After World War II he studied at The Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. He then obtained a master's degree in Philosophy at the University of Copenhagen. He was a friend of Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), Simon Spies, Tao N√∏rager and Henrik Stangerup.

He was also interviewed in the documentary \\"At skrive eller d√∏ & At forr√•de virkeligheden\\" about his relationship with Henrik Stangerup. He regularly appeared in the Danish TV-program \\"Smagsdommerne\\" until his death. He also appears in the radio documentary \\"Eliten fra Minefeltet\\" where he talks about his relationship to the pianist Klaus Heerfordt. Books =Essay on the Origin of Thought (1974)= Jurij Moskvitin in a thoughtful moment in 1996, \\"This is how I want to be remembered after my death.\\" In this book, Moskvitin records a collection of his theories on the beginnings of thought and language. In his view, the origin of language and thought lie in spontaneous and rare creative acts, often inspired in a human in a stressful and dangerous situation. These thoughts are inspired by a period in which the author turned his attention \\"from 'what he thinks' to 'how he thinks'\\", a turn to introspection. Moskvitin describes how he came to observe \\"states of mind when consciousness is kept somewhere halfway between the waking state and dream.\\" Moskvitin became aware of strange \\"sparks\\" and \\"smoke-like forms\\", which \\"upon close and intense observation became the elements of waking dreams, forming persons, landscapes, strange mathematical fractal forms.\\" Moskvitin came to believe that the hypnagogic patterns he was observing were the actual \`material' out of which the conscious mind \`builds' its representation of the external world. Our inner world of dreams and visions comes before the outer one of sensory stimuli (Closed-eye hallucination). For Moskvitin, this inner world of sequential impressions we observe as our experience. Aggregates of lower-level forms creates concepts and higher-level ideas. In his view, humans have a tendency to relate their experience to the already known, dealing with situations in the world with methods and ideas created prior. It is only when this tendency to the familiar is reversed, or the use of it is nullified, such as in a dangerous situation, does a creative act emerge. The totality of those prior ideas and concepts (the totality of memes) he labels the 'anthroposphere'. For Moskvitin, the origin and development of this anthroposphere is in the multi-thousand year accumulation of rare and fortunate creative acts by individuals put in demanding situations. Analyzing the creative act itself, Moskvitin postulates the existence of a 'projection mechanism' in humans - a mechanism which combines a few sustained impressions into a new aggregate, an idea. Building on what is essentially the stream model of consciousness, the mechanism depends on memory to store sequentially occurring impressions and the combinatorial projecting mechanism which provides the creating actor with the \\"vision\\" of the new idea from the lower-level forms mentioned above. Jurij speculates about schizophrenia as an inability to distinguish between lower-level, interior forms and the exterior. He further postulates that the act of creation might involve a temporary state of schizophrenia. There are also further explorations of the topics of mysticism, occultism, and mathematics. = It's Exciting to Think (1976) = Original title \\"Det er sp√¶ndende at t√¶nke\\". This book was made by Moskvitin in an effort to kick start a child's imagination. It contains classical examples in philosophy and logic and features illustrations by Jakob Hoffmeyer. It was published by Sommer og S√∏rensen. = The Great Wonder (1992) = Original title \\"Den store undren\\". This book takes up the philosophical questions: What is time? who am I? What is real? Why does anything exist at all? and presents them for the adult reader while guiding the reader through the history of philosophy. The book was published by Lindhart og Ringhof in 1992. Shortly thereafter Moskvitin wrote a highly critical and devastating review of his book in the Danish newspaper Politiken under a pen name. The aim was to create debate and interest in the book, but Moskvitin's plan backfired and the result was a low sale. = Simon Spies. The Story of a Friendship (1984,1999) = Original title \\"Simon Spies. Historien om et venskab\\". This book was published twice. Immediately after Spies's death April 16, 1984 Moskivitin began Writing the book which he managed to publish within the same year under the title \\"Simon Spies ‚Äì en myte\\" (Simon Spies a myth). The book received a critical reception in that it painted an honest, but non-glamorous portrait of the Danish tycoon. The book concerns itself with the psychedelic era of Simon Spies's life during the late 60's in which Moskvitin and Spies were close friends. Years later Moskivitin decided to edit out some of the more obscene details while making the book more readable. This \\"final version\\" called \\"Historien om et venskab\\" was published in 1999 by Lindhardt og Ringhof. =The Deaf Lizard (2001)= Image from the same photo session in 1996 as above Original title \\"Den d√∏ve √∏gle\\". Moskvitin wrote this self-portrait as the first of two books, the second of which was never published. It contains the story of Moskvitin's childhood and youth. Moskvitin notably describes how he became friends with Karen Blixen, how he had his first sexual intercourse in Paris, his first great concert in Cairo, and his mother's aristocratic friends. The book follows Moskvitin in his never ending search for women, drugs and spiritual insight. The book was published in 2001 by Lindhardt og Ringhof. = Thou Shalt Not Waste Thy Life (2008) = Original title \\"Du m√• ikke sjuske med dit liv\\". Shortly after the death of Henrik Stangerup in 1998, Jurij Moskvitin started writing Stangerup's biography. It was completed in the spring of 1999. It was due to be released later that year by the publisher Lindhardt & Ringhof, though the latter canceled the publication in the last moment due to concerns about Henrik's posthumous reputation. Only after the journalist Poul Pilgaard, having heard about the manuscript while interviewing pianist Ilja Bergh, tracked down a person possessing a copy, was the book published by Pilgaard's own publishing house Bianco Luno. The publication date was August 29, 2008, three years after Jurij Moskvitin's death.

Ultimately, he was picked by the Golden State Warriors 42nd overall, with the pick they got from the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Clifford Robinson. Taft played in only 17 games in his rookie season as a result of back spasms that ended his season in early January. He had surgery in 2006 to repair a herniated disc and has yet to return to the court in a professional game. In his limited playing time, Chris averaged 2.8 points and 2.1 rebounds in 8.5 minutes per game.

The town is located southeast of the High Tatras in the Spi≈° region, and lies on both banks of the Horn√°d River. It is the biggest town of the Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves District (okres). Tourist attractions nearby include the medieval town of Levoƒça, Spi≈° Castle and the Slovak Paradise National Park. A biennial music festival, Divertimento musicale, is held here, attracting amateur music ensembles from all over Slovakia. Names and etymology The town originated by merging an older Slavic settlement Iglov and a more recent settlement of German collonists (, , - literally New Village).Martin ≈†tef√°nik ‚Äì J√°n Lukaƒçka et al. 2010, Lexik√≥n stredovek√Ωch miest na Slovensku, Historick√Ω √∫stav SAV, Bratislava, 2010, p. 446, . http://forumhistoriae.sk/-/lexikon-stredovekych- miest-na-slovensku Iglov is probably derived from a Slavic word igla (Proto- Slavic ig—äla, j—åg—äla, modern Slovak ihla) - a needle. ≈†imon Ondru≈° explains the name from Slavic jug - the south, a light, Juglava/Iglava/Iglov - a light place, a glade. The name was adopted by the Hungarians as Igl√≥. History Spi≈° Museum in Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves Settlement in the town's region dates to the Neolithic age. There is evidence of a prosperous society that was familiar with copper mining and processing. When the Celts arrived they brought with them advanced iron technology. Celtic coins have been found in the region. During the 6th century, the period known as the Great Migration, Slavic tribes appeared in the Spi≈° region. During the 10th century the structure of their settlements stabilized and important communication roads were established. The settlement was included within the state of Great Moravia. By the 12th century at the latest a Slovak settlement had been established known as Iglov, situated between Mlynsk√° street (Mill Street) and the Reduta, in the centre of the present town. The settlement suffered greatly from the invading Tatars in the 13th century. Saxon (Carpathian German) colonists were settled here in the 13th century and their settlement became known as \\"Villa Nova‚Äù or \\"Neudorf\\", covering the area of the present town. Iglov and Neudorf were amalgamated into one town in the second half of the 13th century. The town received market rights in the 14th century and grew to become an important market town. It became an official mining town in 1380 and had the largest street market in the Kingdom of Hungary. Copper mining was an important activity. The metal was processed in furnaces, which were fuelled with wood from the surrounding forests. A Gothic bell foundry was established by Konr√°d Gaal who made a large hanging bell for Louis I of Hungary, and was consequently knighted in 1357. The bells made by Konr√°d Gaal are still hanging and form an important conlegacy of European Gothic metal foundry. In 1412 Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves, along with several other Spi≈° towns, was pawned as loan security by the Hungarian king Sigmund to the Polish king Vladislaus II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. This pledge lasted for 360 years. Blacksmiths were the first local craftsmen to unite into a guild, which was given royal privileges in 1436. They smelted their own ore, or built water-driven forges along the rivers Horn√°d and Dubnica. Coppersmiths made kettles of a specifically defined weight because kettles were widely used as a means of payment. There were charcoal burners and even resin pickers who collected resin from trees to produce tar for greasing wagons. There were wheelwrights, coopers, weavers, joiners, gunsmiths, basketmakers, bakers, furriers, tanners, cooks and millers, hunters, fishermen and beekeepers. Reduta Theatre in Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves There were many Germans living in Spi≈° and through their influence the town became Lutheran in the 1540s. Between 1569 and 1674 Catholic services were forbidden in the pawned towns. There were many contacts with Poland and this helped to stimulate the national consciousness of the Slovak people. The pawned towns were returned to the Kingdom of Hungary in 1772. In 1778 Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves became the capital of the \\"Province of 16 Spi≈° towns\\". In the 19th century the manufacture of stoneware was important in the town. The products all bore a trademark formed from the word ‚ÄúIglo‚Äù with two crossed miners‚Äô hammers. Other industrial activities included oil production and a weaving plant as well as agricultural machines. The railway provided an important means of communication from 1870. A power station was built in 1894 and living conditions improved. In July 1929 the Podtatransk√° v√Ωstava (Sub-Tatras Exhibition) showed results of economic growth and made the town famous in Slovakia. During World War II, Spi≈°sk√° Nova Ves was taken by Soviet troops of the 18th Army on 27 January 1945. Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves today Main street in Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves. Town hall and church Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves is a tourist destination today, both because of the town itself and because of the natural environment of the nearby Slovak Paradise mountains. The core of the town is a lens-shaped square (a square with bulging sides), typical of medieval towns. It is a cultural, administrative and business centre of the Spi≈° region, and is rich in art and historical monuments. Foremost is the three-naved Gothic church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary standing in the centre of the town. Its construction dates back to the 14th century and its architecture has been partly preserved. The bas-relief of the Virgin Mary's Coronation on the Gothic tympanum on the south portal of the church is considered to be amongst the most beautiful in the Spi≈° region. It contains carvings by Master Paul of Levoƒça. The side pillars are topped by Gothic pinnacles terminating in crossed rosettes. A rosette with tracery crowns the entrance of the church. The tower is 87m high, the tallest church tower in Slovakia. The neogothic top of the tower dates from 1893 and was executed by the architect Imrich Steindl. The neogothic altar dates from the end of the 19th century. The church contains several liturgical treasures : a cross- shaped silver (and partly gilded) reliquary by the Sienese court jeweller Nicolas Gallicus (first half of the 14th century - but the initials NC may also refer to a possible contributor Nicolaus Castellanus), a silver (partly gilded) crucifix and monstrance attributed to Antonio from Ko≈°ice (early 16th century), a chalice by Jan Kolbenhayer (1795) and a rare bronze baptismal font (second half 13th century). The Calvary Group (1520) is another masterpiece from the workshop of the Master Paul of Levoƒça. The church vaulted ceiling contains early renaissance paintings with the Evangelists and four angels playing on musical instruments. The Evangelical church, standing next to the town hall, was built in Classicist style between 1790 and 1796. It has a cross-shaped ground plan. Inside is an altar piece of Christ on the Mount of Olives, painted by Danish painter Stunder. The water well is decorated with an alabaster relief of Christ with the Good Samaritan. Another valuable architectural monument is the Province House, now housing the Spi≈° museum. It has a baroque fa√ßade, but the basement dates from the 13th century. This house was the town hall from the Middle Ages until 1777. The peace treaty between John Jiskra of Brand√Ωs and the Hungarian king Vladislav was signed here in 1443. Its fa√ßade includes the underpass \\"Levoca gate\\" with in the middle of its arch the crest of the Province of XVI Spi≈° towns. The upper part of the fa√ßade is decorated with rococo stucco motives (rocaille) representing in Latin the moral qualities required of a town official : (from left to right) PONDERE SOLO (According to importance only), UTQUIS MERETUR (as one deserves), SUUM CUIQUE (give everyone his due), DIE NOCTUQUE (day and night), IN SOMNIS CUSTOS (guardian during sleep), HINC OCULOS NUSQUAM (not turning his eyes away). The Town Hall was built between 1777-1779 in the Classical style, and was reconstructed in the mid-1990s. The main fa√ßade faces south while the main entrance is on the north side. The south fa√ßade has three big arched windows situated between four semi-columns under a massive tympanum. Within the tympanum is the city's coat-of-arms between two griffins.The two inner columns have Ionic capitals. The council chamber occupies two floors and is lavishly decorated with pilasters and sgraffito with motifs of drapery alternating with the city coat-of-arms. The theatre building \\"Reduta\\" was built in art-nouveau style between 1899 and 1902 by the Budapest architect Koloman Gerster. He divided its northern and southern part by a risalith (a projection jutting out of the fa√ßade). He accentuated the corners of the building by four turrets. He prolongated the western part into a semicircular vestibule. The stage wall is decorated with murals by the Slovak - local artist Jozef Hanula. Today the building combines a theatre, a richly decorated concert hall and a restaurant.Kosicky kraj Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 39,193 inhabitants. 94.21% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.93% Roma and 0.51% Czechs. The religious makeup was 69.81% Roman Catholics, 16.95% people with no religious affiliation, 3.17% Lutherans and 3.05% Greek Catholics. Transportation Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves railway station is a junction between the Ko≈°ice‚Äì≈Ωilina railway, which is part of Slovakia's main east-west rail corridor, and a spur line to Levoƒça. Regular passenger services on the spur line have been suspended since 2003. Public transport is provided by the eurobus, a.s. company and consists of 15 bus lines.

It was released in 1999 on the Sony PlayStation video game console, and in 2007 on the Sony PlayStation Network. When a terrorist organization called Odessa tries to conquer the world, an international anti-terrorist group called ARMS is formed to combat them. They recruit several heroes to help them, including Ashley, a gunfighter; Lilka, a teenage sorceress; and Brad, a former war hero. Gameplay Wild Arms 2 is a role-playing game that involves the player controlling several characters as they progress through a number of environments, battle enemies, and solve puzzles. The game is presented in an isometric fashion where the player has an overhead view of all the action taking place on a particular screen. While characters are represented as two-dimensional sprites, backgrounds and environments are instead rendered in 3D. The game's camera is centered on the currently controlled character, which can be rotated by the player through 360 degrees. In order to advance, the player must overcome a number of story-based scenarios and sequences that involving navigating through dungeons while fighting monsters and other enemies that appear randomly every few steps. Oncoming battles are indicated by a speech balloon with an exclamation mark appearing over the character's head, and can in some instances be avoided. Characters progress and grow by gaining experience points after a battle and thereby gain levels, giving them better statistics and making them able to battle increasingly difficult enemies. Progressively more powerful armor and weapons can be purchased for each character from specialized shops in towns throughout the world, and new skills can be learned to help the player complete tougher challenges. Special devices called \\"Tools\\" unique to each character allow the player to traverse otherwise impassable situations while not in battle. These items are obtained at certain points in the game, and allow hidden areas or pathways to be discovered, as well as destroy objects and solve puzzles. Tools such as Brad's \\"kick boots\\" allow him to move large objects by hitting them, and Lilka's fire wand allows the player to light torches and activate switches from afar. =Tools= Throughout the game, one acquires many tools. Each character can unlock three tools. Ashley's tools are the Hurl Knife, Booty Call (secret - telepath tower), and Flare Gun. Brad's tools are the Kick Boots, Bombs, and Earthquake. Lilka utilizes three rods: Fire, Freeze, and Change, which turns large gems into traversable blocks. Tim uses \\"Pooka\\", a guide which can unlock secret \\"medium\\" powers, as well as Air Ballet and Mist Cloak. Kanon uses the Wire Hook, Rad Blades, and Jump Shoes. Marivel, the secret character, comes with the Electel, and can unlock the Windup Key and My Mike, which summons secret enemies. =Battle system= While normal gameplay is exhibited using both two and three-dimensional graphics, battle sequences are rendered entirely in 3D. Wild Arms 2 utilizes a turn-based approach to combat, with playable characters and enemies acting according to their \\"response\\" or RES statistic, a numerical designation that shows how fast a character is and how soon they can act. A character or enemy with the highest response rate will act first, followed by the next highest in sequence every combat round until the battle is over. Each round, the player has the option of performing a number of actions with each character, including attacking enemies, defending, running from battle, or using curative items to restore hit points, a representation of a particular character's remaining vitality. In all, six characters are available for use in and out of combat, though only three may be used in a particular battle. In addition to having different statistics such as strength and magic power, each character has a unique set of abilities at their disposal. Ashley and Brad, each firearm users, can use powerful attacks based on whatever weaponry the player has collected throughout the course of the game, while Lilka, a magician, can conjure a variety of spells to either aid party members by curing wounds or damage enemies with harmful magic. Additional members Tim, Kanon, and Marivel have their own respective techniques as well. Each character can be actively switched in or out of a battle at any time, provided enough characters are in the player's party at the time. Plot =Setting= Wild Arms 2 is set in the world of Filgaia, a planet made to resemble the American Old West with additional science fiction, steampunk, and traditional fantasy elements. An example of \\"Weird West\\", the game contains several stock elements from American Western films, literature, and folklore, including expansive deserts, dry plains, red rock canyons, saloons, and gunfights melded with traditional role-playing game story elements such as magic and demons. Firearms factor heavily in Filgaia's mythology. Called \\"ARMs\\", these weapons represent the world's ever-growing warfare technology, and, unlike the first Wild Arms, are not considered inherently dangerous. Similar technology is used to create other mechanical weaponry not common in normal Western fiction, including cybernetic limbs and miniature robots. Other forms of high technology such as aircraft, motorized vehicles, and radio devices also make an appearance, though some of their usage is attributed to magic rather than science. =Characters= The cast of Wild Arms 2 is made up of a number of playable and non-playable characters who each contribute to the advancement of the story. The main characters are those controlled by the player, consisting of six heroes who are called upon by a wealthy benefactor to put an end to the criminal organization Odessa, who act as the game's principal adversaries. \\"Operation ARMS\\" serves as the moniker of the player's team, with each member contributing something unique to both gameplay and the story, led by the reluctant young gunman Ashley Winchester. ARMS is aided by a number of other supporting characters, including Ashley's girlfriend Marina. The game's primary conflict stems from the two group's conflicting ideologies on the safety of the world. While Odessa seeks to bring about order through oppression and conformity, ARMs instead sees Odessa's methods as a sacrifice of freedom and the largest threat to global security. The main characters include Ashley Winchester, Lilka Eleniak, Brad Evans, Tim Rhymeless, Kanon, and Marivel Armitage, a secret character that can be unlocked at \\"Crimson Castle\\". Irving Vold Valeria, the leader of ARMS, introduces Marivel in the beginning of the game, and her true form is shown at the \\"Memory Maze\\", where the Sword Magess Anastasia reveals herself to Ashley. Marivel then joins ARMS at Crimson Castle, and several different events can be unlocked. =Story= One thousand years earlier, a great Blaze of Disaster swept the land of Filgaia. The cause was a demon known as Lord Blazer. Many heroes tried to defeat him and failed, until a girl holding the magic sword Argetlahm stepped forth and did battle with him, ultimately managing to defeat him. However, she could not kill him; rather, she exchanged her life in order to seal Lord Blazer away forever. The girl's name was forgotten by time, and she became known as simply the Sword Magess. In the present day, Filgaia is a desolate land, dying steadily. Much of the world has already become desert, and the few areas of greenery left are steadily declining. Ashley Winchester, a member of a military unit near Meria Boule, becomes involved in the fate of the world when his group is involved in a demon summoning experiment. This experiment is conducted by the sinister organization of Odessa in order to resurrect Lord Blazer - or so it seems. After all of his friends and comrades have been possessed by demons, Ashley is finally taken over as well. After killing all of his former comrades, he claims the legendary Argetlahm, which had been brought to the summoning ceremony as a relic. After coming into contact with it, he confronts both the demon inside him, Lord Blazer himself, and the wielder of the sword, the Sword Magess. Managing to repress Lord Blazer for the time being, Ashley escapes back to his home town of Meria. However, this is not the end of it for Ashley. He soon receives an offer from a mysterious man named Irving to join an elite team of fighters named \\"ARMS\\" (Agile Remote Missions Squad)/(Awkward Rush and Mission Savers). After accepting, Ashley meets the other two people selected for ARMS - Lilka Eleniak and Brad Evans; one an ex-war hero turned criminal, one a girl in training to be a Crest Sorceress. Irving reveals his plans to them: he wishes to combat Odessa, which he claims will make its presence known to the world soon. The three protagonists engage in a series of events that eventually come to involve the fate of the world of Filgaia itself. Reception Eric Bratcher reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"An adequate title, but one that doesn't have as much to offer as competitors such as Vagrant Story or Alundra 2.\\" The game received mixed reviews upon release. It scored a 5.4 (mediocre) rating from GameSpot and 6.0 (okay) from IGN. In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 31 out of 40.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ - „ÉØ„Ç§„É´„Éâ„Ç¢„Éº„É†„Ç∫ 2nd„Ç§„Ç∞„Éã„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.21. 30 June 2006.

Pilsner style lagers are the most commonly produced beer style in Japan, but beer-like beverages, made with lower levels of malts called happoshu (literally, \\"bubbly alcohol\\") or non- malt have captured a large part of the market, as tax is substantially lower on these products. Microbreweries have also gained increasing popularity since deregulation in 1994, supplying distinct tasting beers in a variety of styles that seek to match the emphasis on craftsmanship, quality, and ingredient provenance often associated with Japanese food. Craft beer bars and pubs have also increased in popularity in Japan's major cities, with cities such as Tokyo and Osaka have very vibrant craft beer bar scenes, generally with a focus on locally produced and imported craft beers from the US and Europe.Discovering Tokyo's Craft Beer Bars - The City Lane In late 2014, Kirin announced its entry into the craft beer segment with the launch of a wholly owned subsidiary, Spring Valley Brewing, with two brewpubs in Daikanyama, Tokyo, and Namamugi, Yokohama. These both officially opened in 2015. Industrial brewery Sapporo also announced its release of a craft line in early 2015. History Beer in Japan had its start in the 17th century during the Edo period when Dutch traders stationed at Dejima in Nagasaki opened a beer hall for sailors working the trade route between Japan and the Dutch Empire. As Japan reopened to foreign trade during the Meiji period, imported beers such as Bass Pale Ale and Bass Stout were available in limited quantities in the foreign settlements, but trained brewers from Europe and elsewhere also arrived to contribute to the growth of the local industry. The brewery that would become Kirin Brewery Company began in Yokohama in late 1869 as the Spring Valley Brewery, a private business established by Norwegian-American, William Copeland. The Sapporo Brewery was founded in 1876 as a part of a government-directed development plan for Hokkaido. Asahi Breweries traces its founding heritage to the start of the Osaka Beer Brewing Company in 1889, and the launch of the Asahi Beer brand in 1892. Market size Japanese convenience store selection of beer Beer or beer-like happoshu beverages are the most popular alcoholic drink in Japan, accounting for nearly two thirds of the 9 billion liters of alcohol consumed in 2006.William Campbell, What the Japanese are drinking, The Japan Times, April 13, 2007. Japan's domestic consumption of the total 187.37 million kiloliter global beer market in 2012 was about 5.55 million kiloliters or about 3.0%. This statistic for total beer consumption in Japan also includes beer-like low-malt beer and no-malt beer products. In terms of national per capita beer consumption Japan ranked 51st in 2014, equivalent to 42.6 liters per person, reflecting the diversified alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage market enjoyed by Japanese consumers. Demographic factors are expected to continue to push down sales of mass-market beer products in Japan for the foreseeable future as younger consumers are drinking less beer than previous generations. For the calendar year 2013, overall shipments for Japan's five largest brewers were 433.57 million cases, (a case is equivalent to 12.66 liters of beer or 27 US pints) more than 20% off the market peak achieved in 1992. However, for locally produced craft beers accounting for less than 1% of domestic beer consumption and selected premium imported beers, market opportunities continue to expand. According to local market data, in the first eight months of 2012, shipments of domestic craft beer rose 7.7 percent while sales by Japan's largest brewers continued a year on year decline. As of January 2014, Asahi, with a 38% market share, was the largest of the four major beer producers in Japan followed by Kirin with 35% and Suntory with 15%. Beer classification Due to the Japanese taxation system, the varieties of brewed malt beverages in Japan are categorized into two groupings: beer and happoshu. The distinction is made based on the amount of malt used relative to grain adjuncts, with the term happoshu ascribed to low-malt brews. Japanese regulations forbid the use of the word to describe brews containing less than 50% malt (thus allowing up to 50% adjuncts including rice, corn, sorghum, potato, starch, and sugar). Kamiya, Setsuko, \\"Suds on tap for summer thirsts\\", The Japan Times, 7 August 2007, p. 2. Since 2004, Japanese breweries have produced even lower-taxed, non-malt brews made from soybeans and other ingredients which do not fit the classifications for beer or happoshu. Dubbed , they are officially classified as \\"other miscellaneous alcohol\\" or \\"liqueur\\". Major beer producers *Asahi Breweries *Kirin Company *Sapporo Brewery *Suntory *Orion Breweries =Dry Wars= The Dry Senso or „Éâ„É©„Ç§Êà¶‰∫â („Å©„Çâ„ÅÑ„Åõ„Çì„Åù„ÅÜ, dorai sens≈ç) meaning Dry Wars, was a period of intense competition between Japanese brewery companies over dry beer. It began in 1987 with the launch of Asahi Super Dry by Asahi Breweries which led to the introduction of dry beer by other breweries. The Kirin Brewery Company, which held 50% share of the Japanese domestic beer market, launched Kirin Dry in February 1988 in an advertising campaign featuring actor Gene Hackman, and in April of the same year launched the all-malt Kirin Malt Dry. However, they were unable to stop Asahi's momentum. In 1990 Kirin launched Ichiban Shibori in direct competition with Asahi Super Dry, but ended up cannibalising profits on their own Kirin Lager Beer brand. Kirin never ended up regaining its 50% market share. Sapporo Breweries launched the doomed Sapporo Dry in February 1988, and in May 1989 rebranded their flagship product Sapporo Black Label as Sapporo Draft to an unfavourable reception. Production of Sapporo Dry and Sapporo Draft was halted less than two years after their respective launches, and Sapporo Draft later returned to being Black Label. Suntory launched their Malts brand in February 1988 in an \\"I don't do dry\\" campaign, while at the same time launching Suntory Dry, later rebranded Suntory Dry 5.5 in an advertising campaign featuring boxer Mike Tyson after increasing the alcohol content from 5% to 5.5%. This achieved reasonable results, although not enough to slow down demand of Asahi Super Dry. The Dry Wars were criticised in an episode of the manga Oishinbo (the Gourmet), published at around the time of the saga. =Seasonal beers= Many breweries in Japan offer seasonal beers. In autumn, for instance, \\"autumn beers\\" are brewed with a higher alcohol content, typically 6% as opposed to the common 5% of Asahi Super Dry. For example, Kirin's Akiaji beer. The beer cans are typically decorated with pictures of autumn leaves, and the beers are advertised as being suitable for drinking with nabemono (one-pot cooking). Similarly, in winter, beers such as ÂÜ¨Áâ©Ë™û or Fuyu Monogatari („Åµ„ÇÜ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åå„Åü„Çä, translated as \\"The Winter's Tale\\" on the can) appear. Microbreweries In 1994, Japan's strict tax laws were relaxed allowing smaller breweries producing 60,000 litres (15,850 gal) per year for a beer license or 6000 litres per year for a happoshu license. Before this change, breweries could not get a license without producing at least 2 million litres (528,000 gal) per year. As a result, a number of smaller breweries have been established throughout Japan. After of relaxation of tax laws in the early 1990s, the commonly used term for microbrew in Japan was , or \\"local beer\\", although Japanese microbrew industry professionals are increasingly using the name in their labels and marketing literature. There are currently over 200 microbreweries in Japan, although many in this number are financially tied to larger sake producers, restaurant chains, resort hotels or similar. Microbreweries in Japan produce various styles of beer including ales, IPAs, stout, pilsner, weissbier, k√∂lsch, fruit beers and others. After the relaxation of the Liquor Tax Law in 1994, there was an initial boom in microbrewing, but the quality of regional microbrews were often mixed and initial consumer enthusiasm leveled off. The popularity of low-cost happoshu (low-malt beer), compared to the high cost microbrews, forced a number of early microbreweries out of business. The dominance of the major industrial brewers and the relative high cost and low volume involved in producing micros led to their only being known to a small number of beer enthusiasts. In the 2000s however, thanks to factors such as licensed production for some bar and restaurant chains, cooperation between micro breweries, and a more educated consumer base, craft beer has seen a more sustained rise in domestic demand. Improved product quality, word of mouth marketing facilitated by social media websites, the attention given to the rise of US-based craft brewing industry and the growth of independent craft beer retail outlets in major cities, have all contributed to the recent success enjoyed by Japanese craft brewers. Today there are a growing number of regional microbrew festivals held throughout Japan, including the Great Japan Beer Festival series held annually in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Yokohama. Every year, the Japan Craft Beer Association holds the Japan Beer Cup, while a competing organization, Japan Craft Beer Support, has launched the annual Nippon Craft Beer Festival. =Notable microbreweries= *Kiuchi Brewery *Yo-Ho Brewing *Spring Valley Brewery Methods of distribution A Sapporo beer vending machine in HokkaidoOther than in serviced restaurants and bars, in Japan beer can be purchased at a wide variety of outlets, including supermarkets, convenience stores, and kiosks at train stations. Beer can also be sold in vending machines although, as of 2012, this has become much less common in major cities. Some vending machines have motion activated advertising that displays on small TV screens embedded into them. They play beer commercials and jingles that are seen on TV and heard on the radio. These vending machines began to be phased out in June 2000, mainly over the concerns of underage drinking. Drinking culture The legal drinking age in Japan is 20 years old. In terms of drinking culture, beer drinking and opening formal toasts with beer, as a part of a group, sports team or after-work corporate social bonding activity, is widespread. Beer can legally be consumed almost anywhere in public, with notable exceptions for organized events, summer festivals and spring cherry blossom parties. Social convention means that open consumption of alcohol on the street or ordinary commuter trains is rare. Japan has very strict laws against operating a motor vehicle or riding a bicycle during or after the consumption of alcohol. Fines, prison time and other penalties can also apply to individuals deemed responsible for supplying alcohol to an intoxicated driver and those traveling in the same vehicle. Japanese beers available outside Japan Japanese-style commercial brewing and beer products have been successfully exported worldwide or are produced locally under license and are distributed in a number of overseas markets. * In the US, three of the four major Japanese brands are available. These include Sapporo Draft, Kirin Ichiban (Number One, as opposed to the normal Lager which is not available), and Asahi Super Dry. Asahi is produced by Molson in Canada, Kirin is produced at Anheuser-Busch facilities in Williamsburg, Virginia and Los Angeles, and Sapporo is produced at a Sapporo-owned brewery in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Suntory beer is not available. Orion Beer is also available, imported from Okinawa Prefecture. Availability of brands depends on an individual state's liquor laws, resulting in some beers being available in some places and others not. For example, in Oklahoma, Asahi Super Dry, Sapporo, and Orion are available, whereas in Texas, Kirin Ichiban is prevalent. Kiuchi brewery was the first Japanese microbrewery to export beer from Japan. Many other Japanese microbreweries now export to North America, Europe, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Homebrewing Although it is technically illegal in Japan to produce beverages containing more than 1% alcohol without a license, the law is rarely adhered to for homebrewers, and homebrewing supplies are available from high street stores and websites.

Utilizing quadrupole technology, there exists two implementations, utilizing either an open ion source (OIS) or a closed ion source (CIS). RGAs may be found in high vacuum applications such as research chambers, surface science setups, accelerators, scanning microscopes, etc. RGAs are used in most cases to monitor the quality of the vacuum and easily detect minute traces of impurities in the low-pressure gas environment. These impurities can be measured down to 10^{-14} Torr levels, possessing sub-ppm detectability in the absence of background interferences. RGAs would also be used as sensitive in- situ leak detectors commonly using helium, isopropyl alcohol or other tracer molecules. With vacuum systems pumped down to lower than 10^{-5} Torr‚Äîchecking of the integrity of the vacuum seals and the quality of the vacuum‚Äîair leaks, virtual leaks and other contaminants at low levels may be detected before a process is initiated. Open ion source OIS is the most widely available type of RGA. Residual Gas Analyzers measure pressure by sensing the weight of each atom as they pass through the quadrupole. Cylindrical and axially symmetrical,http://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/PDFs/ApplicationNotes/RightQuad.pdf, pg. 2 this kind of ionizer has been around since the early 1950s. The OIS type is usually mounted directly to the vacuum chamber, exposing the filament wire and anode wire cage to the surrounding vacuum chamber, allowing all molecules in the vacuum chamber to move easily through the ion source. With a maximum operating pressure of 10^{-4} Torr and a minimum detectable partial pressure as low as 10^{-14} Torr when used in tandem with an electron multiplier. OIS RGAs measure residual gas levels without affecting the gas composition of their vacuum environment, though there are performance limitations which include: * Outgassing of water from the chamber, H_{2} from the OIS electrodes and most varieties of 300-series stainless steel used in the surrounding vacuum chamber due to the high temperatures of the hot-cathode source (> 1300 ¬∞C). * Electron Stimulated Desorption (ESD) is noted by peaks observed at 12, 16, 19 and 35 u rather than by electron-impact ionization of gaseous species, with the effects similar to outgassing effects. This is frequently counteracted by gold-plating the ionizer which in turn reduces the adsorption of many gases. Using platinum-clad molybdenum ionizers is an alternative. Closed ion source With applications requiring measurement of pressures between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3} Torr, the problem of ambient and process gases can be significantly reduced by replacing the OIS configuration with a CIS sampling system. Such an ionizer sits on top of the quadrupole mass filter and consists of a short, gas-tight tube with two openings for the entrance of electrons and exit of ions. The ions are formed close to a single extraction plate and exit the ionizer. Electrically insulated alumina rings seal the tube and the biased electrodes from the rest of the quadrupole mass assembly. The ions are produced by electron impact directly at the process pressure. Such design has been applied to gas chromatography mass spectrometry instruments before adaption by quadrupole gas analyzers. Most commercially available CIS systems operate between 10^{-2} and 10^{-11} Torr and offer ppm level detectability over the entire mass range for process pressures between 10^{-4} and 10^{-2} Torr. The upper limit is set by reduction in mean free path for ion-neutral collisions which takes place at higher pressures, and results in the scattering of ions and reduced sensitivity. The CIS anode may be viewed as a high conductance tube connected directly to the process chamber. The pressure in the ionization area is virtually the same as the rest of the chamber. Thus the CIS ionizer produces ions by electron impact directly at the process pressure whilst the rest of the mass analyzer is kept under high vacuum. Such direct sampling provides good sensitivity and fast response times.

Established in 1970, it is an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is housed in the former Broad Street Station, built in 1917. History =Early proposals= In 1906, the Virginia General Assembly approved funds for the construction of a simple \\"exhibits center\\" to display mineral and timber exhibits being assembled for the Jamestown Exposition of 1907. After the exposition ended, many of the items were moved to Richmond's Capitol Square. The \\"State Museum\\" as it came to be known opened in 1910, adding displays of natural historical specimens from a variety of state agencies to its collection over the years. In 1942, the General Assembly created a study commission to consider establishing an official State science museum. That commission succeeded in endorsing the creation of a \\"Virginia Museum of Science\\" in 1943. The fiscal restraints and pressing concerns of World War II - and the recession which followed it - prevented the General Assembly from taking further action. In 1946, the General Assembly suspended work on a State science museum awaiting appropriate space and funds. By 1964, the General Assembly resumed the project of a \\"State Museum\\". A new study was commissioned, and once again, the establishment of a \\"museum of science, archaeology, and natural history\\" was proposed, but this measure died in the committee. Shortly thereafter, the museum's displays and collections in the basement of the state's Financial Building were gradually disassembled and their collections were dispersed to various State universities. However, the closing of the \\"State Museum\\" galvanized the state's scientific community, and between 1965 and 1967, the Virginia Academy of Sciences, led by Dr. Roscoe D. Hughes, vigorously lobbied Virginia's Governor Mills E. Godwin, to sponsor legislation in the General Assembly to finally establish the State Science Museum. =Creation= Enabling legislation was drafted and approved by the General Assembly, and on July 1, 1970, the Science Museum of Virginia was established. Over the next several years, the Museum attempted to find an empty storefront, warehouse, or other space which could be used as a temporary home. Friends of the Museum pressed the State to allow it to move into part of the old Broad Street Station, which had recently been purchased from the railroad company by the State and was destined for the wrecking ball. Broad Street Station was built by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (RF&P;) in 1917 in the neoclassical style by the architect John Russell Pope. Although the station also served the trains of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL), the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;), and eventually the Seaboard Air Line Railway (SAL), much of the stock of the RF&P; was owned by the State of Virginia's Retirement System, dating to a period before the American Civil War when it was a major investment in Virginia's future. The Museum staff occupied Broad Street Station on January 22, 1976. On January 6, 1977, Governor Godwin, in his second term, presided over the dedication of the Science Museum's first exhibit gallery, The Discovery Room. The event celebrated the fifty-eighth anniversary and rebirth of Broad Street Station and the culmination of over seventy years of effort to establish the Science Museum of Virginia. =Exhibit history= A remodeled and greatly expanded Aquarium opened in 1981. That same year, the world's largest analemmic sundial, located in the Museum's parking lot, was dedicated. It would later be listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. In 1982 the Museum introduced Crystal World, the largest and most comprehensive exhibit in the world on the subject of crystallography. Also introduced was the Solar Challenger, the world's first successful solar airplane, which had just completed a world tour to celebrate its first solar-powered flight from Paris to London. In 1983 the Museum dedicated its new Universe Planetarium & Space Theater, now called The Dome. The Theater's Evans & Sutherland Digistar planetarium projector was the world's first computer/video planetarium projection system and the first that could take visitors on simulated trips through both time and space. Its film projection system was only one of a handful around the world capable of showing 70 mm OMNIMAX films. The theaters' sound system featured over one hundred individual speakers and generated enough power to simulate earthquakes and rocket lift-offs. The seventy-six-foot domed screen of the theater itself was then the world's largest. In 2003 the Museum unveiled the Grand Kugel, the world's largest kugel ball at a cost of $1.5 million. The Grand Kugel was originally carved from an 86-ton block of South African black granite. It was 8 feet, 8.7 inches in diameter, and it floated on a base of granite. Shortly after installation, the Grand Kugel began to crack. The crack eventually spread through the sphere, rendering it unfloatable. A replacement kugel ball was installed in October 2005. The original kugel is still on display behind the museum. In the former train loading area which has been redeveloped, large static displays now include: *Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) steam locomotive and tender, Kanawha class # 2732 *Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (RF&P;) \\"Car One\\" business car *Aluminaut, the world's first aluminum submarine, designed by and built for Richmond-based Reynolds Metals Company in the 1960s, also notable for helping recover a \\"lost\\" U.S. atomic bomb in 1966. In 2014 the Museum upgraded its five-story theater, The Dome, with a new digital projection system. In 2016 the Museum opened a new permanent exhibition, Speed, with an SR-71 Blackbird suspended from the ceiling. The Blackbird was relocated from the Virginia Aviation Museum near the Richmond International Airport. In 2017 the ambitious exhibition Da Vinci --Alive the Experience opened to the public. This travelling exhibition of the art and science of Leonardo da Vinci was developed by Grande Exhibitions in Australia, under the auspices of the Commune di Roma, Commune di Firenze and Citta di Venezia, with the assistance of Pascal Cotte of Lumiere Technology, France. =Affiliated museums= In addition to the Broad Street location, the Danville Science Center in Danville, Virginia is affiliated with the Science Museum of Virginia.

It is a sequel to Wild Arms and Wild Arms 2. Sony Computer Entertainment released it in Japan and North America in 2002 and Ubisoft published it in Europe in 2003. In May 2016 the game was released for PlayStation 4 through PlayStation Network. The story follows Virginia Maxwell, an amateur Drifter (adventurer) looking for adventure on Filgaia, a desert planet with wild west motifs. After foiling an attempted train robbery of a valuable treasure, Virginia joins forces with three other Drifters as they travel the world and unravel a mysterious plot involving the ancient history of the planet. Gameplay Wild Arms 3 is the first game in the Wild Arms series in which all party members are able to use ARMs (magical firearms). It also replaces equippable armor and weapons with Personal Skills via Guardian (Mediums) invocation. The battle graphics use the same background effects as the previous two games in series, but this time the camera can turn 360 degrees around the battle room and the characters can run while battling. As in the past two games, combat utilizes a turn-based system, but this can be modified on a battle-by-battle basis. Unlike traditional RPGs, locations on the world map are not immediately visible. In order to discover new towns and dungeons, the player must ask for information or learn of them during the plot and then manually search for them using a GPS-like system. The world map, which the player must buy, assists the players in finding new locations. Plot The game takes place on a version of the planet Filgaia from the Wild Arms series, a place that is desolate to the point of even its seas consisting of sand, supposedly the result of an ancient war. Four Drifters find themselves chosen to wield the power of the planet's spiritual protectors, the Guardians, to stop a prophesied but unknown menace to their world. As they adventure together, they are opposed by other Drifter teams, a trio of fanatical scientists called the Prophets, and the Demons of Filgaian legend. The four adventurers eventually make startling discoveries about their world's true history, and their personal connections to it. =Characters= Playable characters *Virginia Maxwell is an 18-year-old Drifter who is searching for her long-lost father, whom she believes to still be alive. It is her life's wish to know and live the Drifter life, as her father did. Her ARMS are two revolvers given to her by her father. *Jet Enduro is a cold-blooded boy who suffers from amnesia and who lets nothing get in his way. It is learned at Leyline Observatory that Jet's original name was \\"Adam Kadmon\\" (which refers to \\"Primal Man\\" in Kabbalah), as stated by Werner Maxwell. His ARM is a machine gun; and unknown to Jet, it was designed to be usable only by him. He has a connection to Virginia's father. *Clive Winslett is a 30-year- old, cool-headed bounty-hunter with a soft spot for his family, consisting of his wife, Katherine, and their young daughter, Kaitlyn. Clive is tormented by an event in his past in which his mentor, Professor Berlitz, was killed during an excursion to delve into the mystery of Filgaia's past. Berlitz sacrificed himself to save Clive, to whom his daughter Katherine was engaged. Clive's ARM is a sniper rifle, which was one of many inventions of his mentor. *Gallows Carradine is a 24-year-old native of the Baskar tribe seemingly intent on escaping his hometown and his priestly bloodline, by working as a low-rent Drifter bandit. His grandmother, Halle, gives the party hints and direction throughout the game, while disparaging her \\"useless\\" grandson. Gallows' younger brother Shane is a dream-seer for the tribe, and his predictions are known to always come true. His latest vision was of a \\"Blue Menace\\" who would seek to destroy Filgaia, and was eventually revealed to be Siegfried. His ARM is a sawed-off shotgun and the only of the four main characters' weapons that is never discussed in the plot. Janus' Gang Two teams of Drifters oppose the heroes: one is formed by Janus Cascade, a ruthless but charismatic bandit, and his lackeys, Romero and Dario; Janus later reveals himself to have been working for the Prophets. He is the villain for the first and second parts of the game. The Prophets inject him with Gias, which allows them to keep tabs on him, and punish him for failure via an electric shock. Janus ultimately attempts a not-too-subtle betrayal of the prophets, but it is revealed Janus was intended to be sacrificed by Ziegfried, to allow the demon to have a corporeal form.  Schr√∂dinger Family  The other Drifter team is composed of Maya Schr√∂dinger, her brother Alfred, their stylish afro-ed bodyguard, Todd Dukakis, and a mysterious cat named Shady. Maya feels a rivalry with Virginia, and both helps and hinders Virginia at times. Maya has a unique ability among Filgaians to absorb information from books and to use it to improve battle techniques, hence her Calamity Jane persona. She also appears as a witch and martial artist as well. Alfred is an explosives expert who always uses his trademark bombs. Todd eschews firepower in favor of a sword, the Black Fenrir, used by Jack Van Burace of the original Wild Arms, as well as a few of Jack's techniques. Todd mentions having learned \\"Flash Draw\\", or iaido, techniques from Maya and Alfred's father, whom Todd repays by protecting his children after he dies. Shady was apparently summoned by a Schr√∂dinger of a previous generation, and subsequently locked in a box for some reason. Maya found it in her family's estate and released him, earning his loyalty. It is never explained what exactly Shady is, besides \\"Cat\\", in the game; but it is a likely reference to Schr√∂dinger's cat.  Prophets  The Prophets are a trio of scientists: Leehalt Alcaste, Melody Vilente, and Malik Bendict, who are obsessed with restoring Filgaia's decaying environment; unfortunately, they do not care who suffers as a result. Each also has a personal agenda: Leehalt wants to rule, Melody wants to retain her beauty, and Malik wants to resurrect his dead mother. Following the advent of Siegfried, the trio gain more demonic forms. They are villains for the second and third parts of the game, and each demonstrates the ability to summon monsters at will, often resulting in a boss-battle for the heroes. A golem named Asgard is made by the prophets. He eventually gains feelings and personality, due to being programmed to absorb data from every battle. His name is a reference to the \\"Earth Golem\\" of the first Wild Arms, as its name was Asgard in the Japanese version, and the PS2 remake, Alter Code: F.  Lombardia  The mythical dragon Lombardia allies herself with the party after they decide to look into acquiring aerial transportation. She joins them under the condition that she will be able to fight once again, and quench her thirst for battle. Lombardia's transformation into a jet-like form has likened her to that of the Transformers robots.  Demons  The Metal Demon Zeikfried from the first Wild Arms game returns, though his name is respelt Siegfried. He is the villain for the third part of the game, after he is revived by the Prophets at the Yggdrasil facility. He is also referred to as the \\"Blue Menace\\" of Shane's dreams. He acquires the three shields collected by Janus earlier, \\"Andro\\", \\"Crio\\", and \\"Hieraco,\\" and applies their power to the prophets, making himself three new demon followers, akin to Alhazad, Harken, and Belselk of the first game. A Dream Demon named Beatrice appears near the end of the game, and is the villain for the final part of the game. Contrary to the way she apparently shows up out of nowhere, she can be encountered as a random NPC in some of the game's towns, but can't be addressed, as she will be gone if the party reaches where she is. Beatrice ultimately reveals herself to be playing the role of the great manipulator, as every major event in the game can somehow be attributed to her. She is responsible for Shane's \\"dream sight\\", as well as for guiding Lamium, the chairman of the members at the Ark of Destiny. She had used members of the Council of Seven to attempt to sabotage the Yggdrasil, and create her Filgaia, ten years prior, which led to the defoliation of the planet, after which she removed everyone's memory of the event. Her ultimate goal is to build a \\"new Filgaia\\", and propagate a new lineage of demons there. Strangely, after she is defeated at the end of the game, her voice is still heard, hinting that she may not be through with Filgaia after all. While never alluded to outside of a few books in the game, and never affecting the plot, Wild Arms series' staple optional boss, Ragu O Ragla, appears once again as the ultimate boss of the Abyss optional dungeon. He is described as the King of the Monsters and as so terrible that he was sealed in the depths of the Abyss, so he would never return to savage Filgaia. He is fought in two battles in this game, once at floor 100 of The Abyss, and once again, stronger, when he blocks the parties' exit from the area back on the first floor.  Council of Seven  The game continually makes references to a group called the Council of Seven, a team of scientists who, ten years prior to the start of the game, were conducting experiments to restore the pulse of life to Filgaia in a facility known as the Yggdrasil. Unfortunately, the experiment went awry and did the exact opposite, sucking most of the remaining life from the planet, leaving most of it an expansive desert. Notable members of this group are each of the Three Prophets, as well as Virginia's father, Werner Maxwell. Rounding out the group are Jet's adoptive father/creator, Elliot Enduro, as well as Pete Inkapilia, and Duran Bryant, about whom little is revealed; but their notes detail that they were repeatedly visited by Beatrice in dreams. Virginia's mother, Ekatrina, was also working with the Council at some point in the past. Development and release The game's introduction and event animations were produced by Bee Train Production Inc. with P.A. Works, directed by Koichi Mashimo with Kazuya Tsurumaki. The game was re-released for the PlayStation 4 via PSN May 17, 2016, it includes improved resolutions and trophies. Its songs were replaced with purely instrumental versions of the music. Reception Wild Arms 3 received generally positive reception from critics. Critics praised the cel-shaded graphics along with the deep story and characters, while criticizing the frequent battles and world map searching system. Metacritic gave it a score of 78 from 30 reviews. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥2 - „ÉØ„Ç§„É´„Éâ„Ç¢„Éº„É†„Ç∫ „Ç¢„Éâ„É¥„Ç°„É≥„Çπ„Éâ„Çµ„Éº„Éâ.

Kappeler et al.: A New Mirza Species Primate Report 71, July 2005 (PDF) They are part of the primate order, and classified in the family Cheirogaleidae. Previously, both populations of giant mouse lemurs were believed to belong to one species. The northern giant mouse lemurs are small nocturnal lemurs endemic to Madagascar. They weigh about , and have long, bushy tails and relatively small ears. Their large testicles are an indication of their promiscuous copulation system. These lemurs have been found to use communal sleeping nests including multiple males, which is an uncommon behaviour in lemurs. Etymology The word zaza means child in Malagasy. The name was chosen because the northern giant mouse lemur is the smaller of the two giant mouse lemur species, and because of a wish to emphasize the responsibility of the current generation of Malagasy children for the conservation of Malagasy animals for future generations. Description The northern giant mouse lemur is relatively small, with juveniles weighing 150 - 199 g, subadults 200 - 249 g, and fully grown adults 250 - 300 g. This species has large testes, among the largest relative testes to body size in the Primate order. Distribution The M. zaza are found in a strictly limited region in the north-western part of Madagascar, the Ampasindava peninsula. The habitat is split by two rivers, the Mahavavy River to the north and the Maevarano River to the south. In some areas it is further separated by the Sambirano River. This area in Madagascar has a dry and cool season from May to October, and a wet and hot season from November to April. The species can be found in a transition zone which goes to the Sambirano evergreen rainforest that extends to the north. Home ranges cover 0.52 - 2.34 ha. There is no substantial overlap in home ranges among individuals. An estimated 385 - 1,086 individuals per km2 are present throughout the region. Behavior The species has a polygynandrous mating system, likely based on the large size of the testes, which engenders strong sperm competition. Breeding is aseasonal. The northern mouse lemur is nocturnal, feeding predominantly during the second half of the night. On average, individuals stay approximately 7 meters up in the canopy. During the day they sleep in group-exclusive tree holes. Nesting groups are 2 - 8 individuals in size, made up of both sexes and any age class, and include unrelated males. Conservation The species is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN primarily due to loss of habitat. The deciduous forests that they live in are being logged, fragmented, and degraded. The species is listed in CITES Appendix I. References Category:Mammals described in 2005 Category:Lemurs ","title":"Northern giant mouse lemur"},{"id":"2431980","text":"Hino Motors, Ltd. (Êó•ÈáéËá™ÂãïËªäÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ, Hino Jid≈çsha), commonly known as simply Hino, is a Japanese manufacturer of commercial vehicles and diesel engines (including those for trucks, buses and other vehicles) headquartered in Hino, Tokyo. The company is a leading producer of medium and heavy-duty diesel trucks in Asia. Hino Motors is a large constituent of the Nikkei 225 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It is a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation and one of 16 major companies of the Toyota Group. History The company traces its roots back to the founding of Tokyo Gas Industry Company in 1910. In 1910 Chiyoda Gas Co. was established and competed fiercely against incumbent Tokyo Gas Company for gas lighting users. Tokyo Gas Industry was a parts supplier for Chiyoda Gas but it was defeated and merged into Tokyo Gas in 1912. Losing its largest client, Tokyo Gas Industry Co. broadened their product line including electronic parts, and renamed itself as Tokyo Gas and Electric Industry (Êù±‰∫¨Áì¶ÊñØÈõªÊ∞óÂ∑•Ê•≠), TG&E; and was often abbreviated as Gasuden. It produced its first motor vehicle in 1917, the Model TGE \\"A-Type\\" truck. In 1937, TG&E; merged its automobile division with that of Automobile Industry Co., Ltd. and Kyodo Kokusan K.K., to form Tokyo Automobile Industry Co., Ltd., with TG&E; as a shareholder. Four years later, the company changed its name to Diesel Motor Industry Co., Ltd., which would eventually become Isuzu Motors Limited. The following year (1942), the new entity of Hino Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. spun itself out from Diesel Motor Industry Co., Ltd., and the Hino name was born. During World War II, Hino manufactured Type 1 Ho-Ha half-track and Type 1 Ho- Ki armored personnel carrier for the Imperial Japanese Army. Following the end of World War II, the company had to stop producing large diesel engines for marine applications, and with the signing of the treaty, the company dropped the \\"Heavy\\" from its name and formally concentrated on the heavy-duty trailer- trucks, buses and diesel engines markets, as Hino Industry Co., Ltd. The company took its name from the location of its headquarters in within Tokyo prefecture. To sharpen its marketing focus to customers, in 1948, the company added the name \\"Diesel\\" to become Hino Diesel Industry Co., Ltd. In 1950 the heavy-duty TH10 was introduced, equipped with the all-new 7-liter DS10 diesel engine. An eight-tonner, this was considerably larger than existing Japanese trucks which had rarely been built for more than payload. In 1953, Hino entered the private car market, by manufacturing Renaults under licence, and in 1961 it started building its own Contessa 900 sedan with an 893cc rear- mounted engine, and a pickup truck called the Hino Briska with the Contessa engine slightly enlarged and installed in the front with rear wheel drive. The Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti redesigned the Contessa line in 1964 with a 1300 cc rear-mounted engine. Fed by two SU type carburettors, this developed 60 hp (44 kW) in the sedan and 70 hp (51 kW) in the coup√© version. However, Hino ceased private car production very quickly in 1967 after joining the Toyota group. In 1963, the Hamura factory began operations, and focused entirely on commercial truck and bus manufacture. Hino Trucks have also been assembled in Portugal and in Canada. In 2018, Hino and Volkswagen Truck and Bus (later renamed Traton) announced a wide-ranging strategic partnership for activities including procurement, technologies and logistics. In November 2019, they established a procurement joint venture called Hino and Traton Global Procurement, with 51% of it owned by Traton and 49% by Hino. = Canada = Hino has been marketing trucks in Canada since the 1970s.

During the years 1964‚Äì1965, Israel was Hino's second most important market for its Contessas. Israel exports amounted to ~10% of total Contessa production. After it was purchased by Toyota, the contract was terminated and the very last Israeli Contessas rolled off the assembly line in March 1968. In total, over 8,000 Hino Contessa and Briska were assembled in Israel. = Mexico = In mid 2008, Hino Motors was said to be building a new truck assembly facility in Guanajuato, Mexico, serving international deliveries. The facility was reportedly built in an 80:20 partnership with Japanese trading firm Mitsui, opening in 2009 and with a production capacity for 1,200 of the Hino 500 series trucks per year. = Pakistan = Hinopak Motors was formed in 1985 by a diverse group of sponsors.

The Suda calls him a rhetorician, and Polyaenus himself writes that he was accustomed to plead causes before the Roman emperor. Polyaenus dedicated Stratagems in War to the two emperors Marcus Aurelius () and Lucius Verus (), while they were engaged in the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 161‚Äì166, about 163, at which time he was too old to accompany them in their campaigns. Polyaenus, Stratagems in War, 1821 Stratagems This work is divided into eight books: the first six contain accounts of the stratagems of the most celebrated Greek generals, the seventh book contains stratagems of non Greeks and Romans, and the eighth book those of the Romans and of illustrious women. Parts, however, of the sixth and seventh books are lost, so that of the 900 stratagems which Polyaenus described, 833 have survived. The book has survived in a single copy made in the 13th century, although there exist five abridged versions, which will be discussed below. The full copy once belonged to Michel Apostolios and is now in the Laurentian Library in Florence. The work is written in a clear and pleasing style, though somewhat tinged with the artificial rhetoric of the age. It contains a vast number of anecdotes respecting many of the most celebrated men in antiquity, and has uniquely preserved many historical facts. There are no less than five Byzantine abridgments of this work, the most important one of which is held in the same library of the original, the Laurentian. This compendium, titled ·ΩôœÄoŒ∏Œ≠œÉŒµŒπœÇ ·ºêŒ∫ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒπŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ œÄœÅŒ¨ŒæŒµœâŒΩ, contains 58 chapters and 354 stratagems, and is useful to elucidate and explain many passages of the original, lost or not. Despite the existence of the abridgements, Polyaenus' treatise was not popular in the Middle Ages. The original is rarely cited by Byzantine sources, which suggests that it had ceased to circulate, and that the abridgements had replaced it. To this it must be added that only the ·ΩôœÄoŒ∏Œ≠œÉŒµŒπœÇ derives directly from the original, while the other four versions seem to be summaries of the first. Polyaenus was first printed in a Latin translation, executed by Justus Vulteius, at Basel, 1549. The first edition of the Greek text was published by Isaac Casaubon, Lyon, 1589; the next by Pancratius Maasvicius, Leyden, 1690; the third by Samuel Mursinna, Berlin, 1756; the fourth by Adamantios Korais, Paris, 1809.Polyaenus‚Äô Stratagems, ELINEPA, 2019 The work has been translated into English by R. Shepherd, London, 1793; into German by Seybold, Frankfurt, 1793‚Äì94, and by Blume, Stuttgart, 1834. Other works Polyaenus also wrote several other works, all of which have perished. The Suda has preserved the titles of two, On Thebes (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ŒòŒ∑Œ≤·ø∂ŒΩ) and Tactics, in three books (Œ§Œ±Œ∫œÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨).

It is a pseudo-random function that provides publicly verifiable proofs of its outputs' correctness. Given an input value x, the owner of the secret key SK can compute the function value y = FSK(x) and the proof pSK(x). Using the proof and the public key PK = g^{SK}, everyone can check that the value y = FSK(x) was indeed computed correctly, yet this information cannot be used to find the secret key. The original construction was rather inefficient. Later, an efficient and practical verifiable random function was proposed by Yevgeniy Dodis and Aleksandr Yampolskiy. The following is only for intuition and is secure only when the input x is from a small domain (the authors then extend it to a larger domain): : F_{SK}(x) = e(g, g)^{1/(x+SK)} \\\\quad\\\\mbox{and}\\\\quad p_{SK}(x) = g^{1/(x+SK)}, where e(¬∑,¬∑) is a bilinear map. To verify whether F_{SK}(x) was computed correctly or not, one can check if e(g^x PK, p_{SK}(x))=e(g,g) and e(g, p_{SK}(x))=F_{SK}(x). The proof of security relies on a new decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion assumption, which asks given (g, g^{x}, \\\\ldots, g^{(x^q)}, R) as input to distinguish R=e(g,g)^{1/x} from random. Uses VRFs provide deterministic precommitments which can be revealed at a later time using proofs which can only be generated by a private key. This is useful for providing a 1:1 mapping of low entropy inputs (e.g. names, email addresses, phone numbers) to some random values which can be committed to in advance, e.g. through a timestamping service such as a transparency log. Unlike traditional digital signature algorithms, VRF outputs can be published publicly without being subject to a preimage attack, even if the verifier knows the public key (but not the proof). This is useful to prevent enumeration of the names/identifiers in a directory which is using a transparency system.

As a leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) following the 1928 assassination of Stjepan Radiƒá, Maƒçek had been a leading Croatian political figure until the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. As a leader of the HSS, Maƒçek played a key role in establishment of the Banovina of Croatia, an autonomous banovina in Yugoslavia in 1939.  Early life  Maƒçek was born in Kupinec near Jastrebarsko, southwest of Zagreb. His father Ivan was a Slovene, originally from Lesiƒçno, and his mother Ida was of mixed Croatian, on her father's side, and Polish descent on her mother's. At the age of six, Maƒçek started attending elementary school in Kupinec, but continued his education in Zagreb, as his father, a public employee, was transferred there. In Zagreb, Maƒçek enrolled at a gymnasium, which he finished when he was 18 and enrolled at the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb. He earned a law degree at University of Zagreb. After clerking at various Croatian courts he opened a private law practice in 1908 in Sv. Ivan Zelina. He joined the Croatian Peasant Party at its founding. = World War I = At the outbreak of the World War I, Maƒçek was a reserve officer. As such, he was mobilised into 25th People's Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army as a commander of the 3rd company on 27 July 1914. Maƒçek participated in the Serbian Campaign and was wounded in the Battle of Kolubara while crossing the river Kolubara in November. After returning from hospital in Novi Sad to Zagreb before the Christmas, he was decorated for bravery and promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Due to his astigmatism, he was declared unfit to serve on the battlefield, and was appointed a commander of an engineer company, composed of Poles and Ukrainians. His company prepared defenses of Budapest, and later Austrian-Hungarian port in Pulj, where he served until autumn 1916. From 15 October 1916 until 15 March 1917 he served in occupying forces in Albania. = After World War I = After World War I, during which he served in the Austro- Hungarian Army, he became a close associate of Stjepan Radiƒá. In 1925, after Radiƒá's visit to Moscow and the Croatian Peasant Party joining the Peasants International, Maƒçek was arrested by the Royal Yugoslav authorities. While in jail, he was elected to the National Assembly. In July 1925, after HSS had joined the government, Maƒçek was released. HSS leadership and Banovina of Croatia Croatian Ban Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá, Vladko Maƒçek and Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac opening the Sava Bridge in Zagreb Maƒçek became the leader of the party on 13 August 1928 following Radiƒá's assassination. He quickly became a main opponent of King Alexander and was arrested in April 1933 and sentenced to three years in jail for treason. Maƒçek was released following Alexander's assassination in 1934. His stated aim during that period was to transform Yugoslavia from a unitary state, dominated by ethnic Serbs, into a new form of state organization in which Croatian statehood would be restored. His ideas appealed to a majority of Croats, and the Croatian Peasant Party gradually gained popularity. He nurtured close relations with other opposition parties in Yugoslavia and, although his coalition lost elections in 1938, it remained a force for reckoning. His persistence and political skills finally paid off in August 1939 with Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá in the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement and the creation of the Banovina of Croatia (Banovina), a semi-autonomous entity which contained Croatia and large sections of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. HSS became part of the coalition government while Maƒçek himself became deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia. World War II This triumph proved to be short-lived as Banovina collapsed along with Yugoslavia when it was invaded by the Axis invasion in April 1941. Seen by Nazi Germany as an ideal leader of a new Axis puppet state‚Äîthe Independent State of Croatia‚ÄîMaƒçek was offered the opportunity to become prime minister, but refused the offer twice. He called on the supporters of HSS to respect and co-operate with the new regime of Ante Paveliƒá, while at the same time delegating Juraj Krnjeviƒá to represent the Croatian people in the Yugoslav government-in-exile. Maƒçek's strategy proved to be detrimental both for his party and himself. In October 1941 he was arrested and interned in Jasenovac concentration camp where he was put under the watch of Ljubo Milo≈° for some time. Five months later, on 16 March 1942, he was placed under house arrest together with his family at his home in Kupinec. His family shared his internment first in Kupinec, then two months of 1943 (9 January to 9 March) in Luburiƒá's Zagreb apartment (which they shared with Luburiƒá's aged mother and his two sisters), and finally from 9 December 1943 until the collapse of Paveliƒá's Usta≈°a regime in May 1945 in his Prilaz 9 house in Zagreb. In the meantime, HSS began to fracture along ideological lines‚Äîsome of its members joined the Usta≈°e, while others joined Tito's Partisans. Although bitterly opposed to the former, Maƒçek was equally distrustful of the latter and in 1945 emigrated, first to France, then to the U.S. Later life Maƒçek's memorial in the Peasant Party's arcade in Mirogoj On 12 June 1945 Maƒçek was received by French foreign minister Georges Bidault who offered him the right of domicile in France. He visited the United States for the first time in 1946 after receiving a visa by order of the Department of State.\\"U.S. View Maƒçek [As] No War Criminal\\", The Windsor Daily Star, 26 September 1946. He was received by mayor David L. Lawrence of Pittsburgh while delivering a speech in that city.\\"Croat Leader Visits Here\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, 13 September 1946. Maƒçek helped found the International Peasants' Union along with Georgi Mihov Dimitrov in 1947. He refused offers for the leadership of the numerous Croatian √©migr√© groups. In 1949, he provided much of the material on Yugoslavia for \\"Communists Crush Churches in Eastern Europe,\\" edited by Reuben H. Markham.He died of a heart attack in Washington D.C. on 15 May 1964, at 84. His remains were taken to Croatia in 1996 and buried in the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb.

He is best known as a former member of The Mars Volta and as the current drummer for Queens of the Stone Age. Theodore is also a member of One Day as a Lion. Known for his explosive, multi-textural playing style, Theodore was a member of both Golden and Royal Trux before joining The Mars Volta in 2001. Theodore remained within the band for five years, recording the band's first three studio albums, De-Loused in the Comatorium (2003), Frances the Mute (2005) and Amputechture (2006), before departing at the request of guitarist and bandleader Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez. Theodore subsequently formed a collaboration with Rage Against the Machine vocalist Zack de la Rocha, entitled One Day as a Lion, and performed on Incubus frontman Brandon Boyd's solo album, The Wild Trapeze (2010). In 2012, Theodore replaced his Mars Volta successor Thomas Pridgen in the supergroup Giraffe Tongue Orchestra, though by 2015 the lineup had reverted to Pridgen on drums. In 2013, Theodore joined Queens of the Stone Age, replacing Joey Castillo, who left the band citing burnout from constant touring. Although Dave Grohl recorded the drums on Queens of the Stone Age's sixth studio album ...Like Clockwork (2013), Theodore accompanied them on the subsequent tour and has since become a full-time member. Biography Theodore first started playing drums at the age of 15. He was soon involved with his high school concert band at Gilman School in Baltimore, Maryland, and took lessons on a full kit shortly after. It was at this point that he studied percussion and learned how to map arrangements; dedicated practice had already become a habit. He also listened to a great variety of music, growing to love the likes of Billy Cobham, Elvin Jones and John Bonham. He studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio. Around the end of his time in high school, he joined the band Golden and recorded and toured with them for ten years. He also played with Royal Trux for a year and a half. It was during this time that he met Cedric Bixler Zavala and Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez, who were performing their first gig with their experimental dub band De Facto in El Paso, TX. They became friends and the former At the Drive-In duo would later invite Theodore to join their Latin-tinged prog-rock band, The Mars Volta. Theodore was The Mars Volta's drummer from 2001 to 2006. On July 30, 2006, it was announced that Jon Theodore would be permanently replaced. He was quoted in Modern Drummer: \\"It was long overdue and unquestionably the best thing for everyone involved. We had a great run of things, made some decent records, blew it up for a minute, and had some really great times. But the life ran out of it. I'm currently working on some pretty sweet tunes for a new project. The details will follow once it takes shape.\\" In 2012, Mars Volta bassist Juan Alderete stated, \\"I love Jon, and I do keep in touch with him. Jon was unhappy and when someone is unhappy, someone has to pull the trigger; and its Omar's band so he did just that. [...] They had to let him go because he wasn't into it as much as they wanted him to be.\\" Theodore has also completed a collaboration with Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine entitled One Day as a Lion. Their first EP was released on July 22 of 2008 In January 2012, he joined Giraffe Tongue Orchestra, replacing fellow former Mars Volta drummer Thomas Pridgen. He recently played as Dam Funk's touring drummer during his Fall 2012 US Tour. A press release from the band Queens of the Stone Age revealed that Theodore would contribute drums on their upcoming album ...Like Clockwork. He played on the title track on the album, which was the first Queens album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. It also reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album. Following the release of the album in 2013, he became the permanent drummer of Queens of the Stone Age. In 2018, Theodore performed drums on certain sections of the score for the video game Red Dead Redemption 2. His Queens of the Stone Age bandmates Joshua Homme and Michael Shuman also are featured on the score. Influences Theodore draws inspiration from many different forms of music but those most prevalent in his playing are jazz, fusion, and rock. He has also touched upon another factor which adds to his individual style - \\"Then there's a whole bunch of stuff from Haiti because my dad's Haitian. My favorite Haitian drummer is this guy called Azor... ...The Haitian music that moves me has the drumming from the voodoo rituals. It moves me because the patterns are connected to different spirits; it's a spiritual thing that is interconnected with dancing, sacrifice and devotion. It's fully passionate. There is nothing contrived about it.\\" In interviews he regularly cites Billy Cobham of The Mahavishnu Orchestra as his main drumming influence: \\"My all-time favorite drummer is Billy Cobham. I love the way he plays... ...[his] playing is so natural, powerful and dynamic at the same time. I pattern a lot of stuff after him.\\". He has also been heavily inspired by John Bonham of Led Zeppelin: \\"He had one of the best feels in the history of rock... ...because [of him] I try and play with as much bombast as I possibly can.\\" Theodore has also mentioned the following drummers and musicians as influences: Elvin Jones, Keith Moon, Phil Rudd, Tony Williams, Sebastian Thomson, Tim Soete, Herbie Hancock, Doug Scharin, Joseph \\"Zigaboo\\" Modeliste, Mitchell Feldstein, Damon Che, Dale Crover, John McEntire, Ryan Rapsys and Brann Dailor.

Prior to the Stainless Steel kit he used: Fibes Crystalite Acrylic Kit 14x10 tom 16x16 floor tom 18x16 floor tom 26x14 kick Added to the kits were a DW Rail Mount and kick spurs. He used a Ludwig LM402T chrome over aluminium snare drum with aftermarket die cast hoops. Theodore has also used various \\"jellybean\\" kits made with toms, snares, and bass drums made from Ludwig, Yamaha, Slingerland, Gretsch, and Sonor, among others. Cymbals: Of recent times Jon has an endorsement contract with Zildjian cymbals. Like most artists his setup varies somewhat over time. 13\\" combo hats (e.g. K top over A New Beat bottom or A Quick Beat top over A New Beat top) 2x 19\\" medium thin crashes from any of the A Custom, Avedis or K lines: For example, he has on occasion used two 19\\" A Custom Projections, on others a 19\\" K Med Thin Dark and a 19\\" Avedis Med Thin and on still others a 19\\" A Custom Projection and a 19\\" Avedis Med Thin. His Zildjian profile states he uses 2x 19\\" Avedis med Thin crashes. 21\\" Avedis Sweet Ride, sometimes with four sizzlers, 22\\" K Ride, 22\\" Avedis Medium Ride, or 23\\" Sweet Ride. A \\"stack of totally busted stuff on a cymbal stand\\" was used in The Mars Volta. On the stand were two hi-hats cymbals with holes drilled through them, a splash cymbal with a cracked bell, a Zildjian ZXT Trashformer and various, smaller shredded cymbals with metal washers. Theodore switched to a 17\\" K China with QOTSA. Hardware: Prior to his endorsement with DW, Jon used Pearl Eliminator single kick pedal and applied surf wax for playing barefoot, along with various straight cymbal stands. Now Theodore uses DW 7000 series Hi-hat and straight cymbal stands with a 5000 pedal. Heads: Remo coated Ambassador on snare batter, CS dots on tom and bass drum batters, clear Ambassadors on bottoms of toms and on front of bass drum. He has also used Powerstroke 3 bass batters (and, on occasion, as resonant heads, too) with a falam pad and coated Ambassadors. Sticks: Jon is a Vic Firth endorser. He uses their American Classic Extreme 5B wood tip model.

The great advantage of the method of sample introduction is its simplicity. MIMS can be used to measure a variety of analytes in real-time, with little or no sample preparation. MIMS is most useful for the measurement of small, non-polar molecules, since molecules of this type have a greater affinity for the membrane material than the sample.

Taking the form of a dialogue, the book was written as a response to the criticism Berkeley experienced after publishing A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge. Repr. in In this collection of essays, Turbayne's work comprised two papers that had been published in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research: * \\"Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind\\" * C. Turbayne's reply to S.A. Grave \\"A Note on Berkeley's Conception of the Mind\\" (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 1962, vol. 22, No. 4). Three important concepts discussed in the Three Dialogues are perceptual relativity, the conceivability/master argument and Berkeley's phenomenalism. Perceptual relativity argues that the same object can appear to have different characteristics (e.g. shape) depending on the observer's perspective. Since objective features of objects cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, shape must not be an objective feature. Background In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision, in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour.See via Google Books This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), which, after its poor reception, he rewrote into the Three Dialogues (1713). Hylas and Philonous Berkeley's views are represented by Philonous (Greek: \\"lover of mind\\"), while Hylas (\\"hyle\\", Greek: \\"matter\\") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents, in particular John Locke. In The First Dialogue, Hylas expresses his disdain for skepticism, adding that he has heard Philonous to have \\"maintained the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the mind of man, to wit, that there is no such thing as material substance in the world.\\"Berkeley, George Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous, First Dialogue, p. 150, Open Court Publishing Company, La Salle, Illinois 1986. Philonous argues that it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and that he can prove it. Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins. Philonous questions Hylas systematically regarding what humans know of the world, first examining secondary qualities, such as heat, to show that such qualities do not exist outside the individual mind. He then moves on to primary qualities such as extension and shape, and likewise argues that they, too, are dependent entirely on one's perception and perspective (e.g., From a distance, a great mountain appears to be small, and the shape of a thing may change dramatically under a microscope: \\"You may at any time make the experiment, by looking with one eye bare, and with the other through a microscope\\"Three Dialogues..., First Dialogue, p. 171, Open Court Publishing, La Salle, 1986.). Hylas's view of matter (which has its origin in the Platonic theory of forms , or abstract entities that exist outside of the sensible world) is systematically destroyed by Philonous (Berkeley). The basic argument is that because matter is only known to us by its sensible qualities, it is impossible to describe or even imagine matter without these qualities. For in the absence of sensible qualities, matter, by definition, loses its essential qualities. Berkeley's argument goes further: sensible qualities are not inherent in matter. Rather, they are ascribed and understood by the mind. Color, sound, temperature and even shape are qualities entirely dependent on a mind. Indeed, without a \\"mind,\\" it becomes impossible to imagine \\"matter.\\" The answer to the question, \\"If a tree falls in the forest and no mind is present, does it make a noise?\\" is answered by Berkeley's immaterialism: There is no tree, other than either the sense-data or the bundle of perceptions of which it is made up. However, God is always perceiving everything. In other words, there is always a mind present. A human (and thus a human mind) need not be present for the tree to make a sound, for the mind of God is always present, or so Berkeley argues. It is this mind of God that gives sensible qualities to matter, not matter itself. In his own time Berkeley faced opposition from many philosophers who shared the Platonic view. These philosophers thought Berkeley to be vulgar, because his own view seemed to confirm the views held by the lower classes. Roughly speaking, the \\"common view\\" was that God created everything and that the things on Earth were the real things. Some philosophers did not believe in God, and believed matter on Earth was but an imitation of actual matter that existed in another dimension. Berkeley sided with the common view. The philosophy presented is often misinterpreted. The criticism is that Berkeley claims that we live in an illusory world, when in fact, Berkeley advocates for the acceptance of ideas as real \\"things.\\" When we refer to an object, we don't refer to a material form, but to the idea of the object that informs our senses. Berkeley doesn't propose that nothing is real; he proposes that ideas themselves compose reality.

Known as the Cobbs Creek Expressway between SW Philadelphia and Interstate 76 and the Crosstown Expressway between I-76 and the waterfront, I-695 was designed to provide connections to the Philadelphia International Airport and become part of a Center City Loop, with the Crosstown Expressway being the southern section of that loop (Schuylkill was going to be the west section, Vine Street as the north, and Delaware Expressway as the east section). Route description I-695 was to begin at I-95 near the Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia. The freeway would head north to the east of Darby Creek, crossing into Delaware County near 84th Street. The road would cross Cobbs Creek and continue to the west of the creek, passing through Colwyn and Yeadon before passing near Mount Moriah Cemetery. I-695 would cross back into Philadelphia and turn east, running through West Philadelphia. The freeway would cross the Schuylkill River and intersect with the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76, previously I-676) near Exit 346B. The Cobbs Creek Expressway would end and the Crosstown Expressway would begin, following Grays Avenue up to South Street, where the route would borrow the cut-and-cover design (which is used on the Vine Street and Delaware Expressways) between the South-Bainbridge Street corridor, before ending at an intersection with I-95 (near the current Exit 20). Exit list Exits were going to be located at these locations: History I-695 was first proposed in 1964. The project to build I-695 was cancelled due to residential opposition in both SW Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, and residents of Yeadon, in Delaware County over the proposed Interstate's right-of-way, which would have \\"cut\\" their communities in half, and would have spelled an end to Cobbs Creek Park. The money slated for construction of I-695 went to the purchase of buses and trains for SEPTA, and for the construction of the Airport Line connecting Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with the Philadelphia International Airport.

It was not an organized political party but an unorganized faction. Most members had been Anti-Federalists in 1788, who had opposed ratification of the US Constitution. However, the situation was fluid, with members joining and leaving. Although contemporaries often referred to Hamilton's opponents as \\"Anti-Federalists,\\" that term is now seen as imprecise since several Anti-Administration leaders has supported ratification, including Virginia Representative James Madison. He joined former Anti- Federalists to oppose Hamilton's financial plans in 1790. After Jefferson took leadership of the opposition to Hamilton in 1792, the faction became a formal party, Jefferson's Republican Party, which is often called by historians and political scientists the Democratic-Republican Party.  History  At the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and during the ratifying process in 1788, Madison was one of the most prominent advocates of a strong national government. He wrote The Federalist Papers, together with Hamilton and John Jay. In 1789 and 1790, Madison was a leader in support of the new federal government. At the time, the concept of a loyal opposition party was novel. However, Madison joined with Henry Tazewell and others to oppose Hamilton's First Report on the Public Credit in January 1790. The creation of the coalition marked the emergence of the Anti-Administration party, which was then based almost exclusively Southern. Madison argued that repaying the debt rewarded speculators,Wood. p. 141. and his proposal to repay only the original bondholders was defeated by a vote of 36 to 13. Hamilton's report also provided for the assumption of state debt by the federal government. Since Massachusetts, Connecticut and South Carolina owed nearly half of this debt, other states resented assumption. The House of Representatives passed the bill without assumption, but the Senate included that provision. The deadlock was broken by the Compromise of 1790, a deal between Madison and Secretary of State Jefferson on one hand and Hamilton on the other, which included both assumption and the locatation the national capital in the South, which later became the District of Columbia.Wood. p. 141‚Äì142. In the summer of 1791, Jefferson and Madison brought the journalist Philip Freneau, a fiery editor of a New York City Anti-Federalist paper, to Philadelphia to start an Anti- Administration newspaper, the National Gazette. Jefferson gave the only State Department patronage position that he had to Freneau. During the Second Congress, the Anti-Administration elements were more numerous and included about 32 House members out of 72. In 1791, Madison and Hamilton again clashed after the latter proposed the creation of a national bank. Southern planters opposed but urban merchants supported the idea. Madison called the Bank unconstitutional, but Hamilton successfully argued that the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution allowed the bank.Wood. p. 145. The French Revolutionary Wars, which began in April 1792, hardened the differences between the factions. The Pro-Administration party generally supported the British or wished to remain neutral, but the Anti-Administration party supported the French. Jefferson joined the latter party in 1792, and it contested the election that year and was called the Republican Party. Politics now became more stable, with well-defined parties (Hamilton's Federalist Party and Jefferson's Republican Party). That created the First Party System, which lasted for two decades.Chambers, William Nisbet, ed. (1972). The First Party System.  References   Further reading  * Banning, Lance.

Rugby career He started his professional career at Newcastle Falcons. In the summer of 2005, he joined Sale Sharks on a two-year contract. However, his contract was cancelled when he was banned for 18 weeks for biting Denis Leamy in a Heineken Cup game against Munster. In the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Taione made 5 appearances before his contract was terminated, and Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title. After his ban he went to Japan to play for the Sanyo Wild Knights. Taione controversially changed his name to Paddy Power for the duration of the 2007 Rugby World Cup in a sponsorship deal agreed with the Irish bookmaker. the sponsorship deal financed the Tongan preparation for the World Cup. The Tongans nearly beat the eventual winner, South Africa, and lost narrowly to the other finalist, England. He then went to play for the , but in the 2008 Super 14 season he was suspended for six weeks after headbutting a Wellington Hurricanes player, and was also suspended for two weeks in the IRB Pacific 5 Nations after dangerously tackling New Zealand Maori Number Eight, Thomas Waldrom.

The idea was created by Jean Buchanan, and later series were written partially by Mark Haddon, author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. It follows the life of Natalie Wild (played by Ellie Beaven) and the other members of the Wild family. Information The Wild House, while a reference to the family surname, also gives an apt description of the impression of the family. Natalie, who seems the 'normal' member of the family, is the character around which the show centres. The show is notable for its frequent use of soliloquy by, at various times, all of the Wilds (even the dog, Jasper). They speak directly to the camera, commenting upon their lives while dream-like images are projected behind them. By the second series, Serena has left for Boston on a science scholarship. Later in the series, Mr. and Mrs. Wild join her in the USA. The family are now looked after by aunts, uncles and a granny. Cousin Georgina, a feisty 16-year-old, also moves in. In the finale, the rest of the Wild clan prepared to move stateside. After the last episode of the series, the principal writer of the series, Jean Buchanan, revealed a new children's television series, Welcome to Orty-Fou. While more of a light drama than a comedy, it is based around an eccentric family, with the same use of soliloquy. Characters =Natalie Wild= Played by Ellie Beaven, Natalie is the articulate 13-year-old \\"middle child\\", whose primary concerns we see in the transition from childhood to teenage years. She is generally the \\"straight man\\" in the face of all the absurdities going on around her. =Serena Wild= Serena (played by Honeysuckle Weeks), 16, is a typical teenager with teenage concerns, most prominently relationships. Her cousin Georgina, who later took her place, had just the same fixation, but was more rebellious and manipulative. =Arthur Wild= Nicknamed \\"Wart\\", Arthur (played by Peter Kelly) is defined by his obsession with wildlife. He is consistently seen with dirt on his clothes and skin presumably from where he has been digging around looking for minibeasts- and seems impervious to this. He has no understanding of his sisters' or cousin's attitudes towards relationships and constantly says \\"Yuk!\\" at the slightest reference to them. He has a friend named Emily who is just as obsessed with animals, but in spite of her being a girl their relationship seems entirely platonic. Only once, in the final episode, did he kiss her, and even then they both said \\"Yuk\\" and wiped it away. Aside from this, another frequent saying of his is, \\"I bet David Attenborough never had this problem\\". =Mr. & Mrs. Wild= Played respectively by Philip Bird and Annette Ekblom, Mr. and Mrs. Wild take less of the stage than their children. They are, in most respects, both typical, average parents, with the possible exception of Mrs. Wild's using a megaphone whenever she wants to make an announcement.

The resort is inhabited by the Ndyuka Maroons, and has a population of 468 people as of 2012. The village is primarily inhabited by Ndyuka of the Ansu clan or lo. Name Wanhatti means \\"one heart\\" in both Sranan Tongo and Ndyuka and refers to the fact that the village is a merger of the villages of Agiti Ondoo and Walimbumofu. History Agiti Ondoo was the site of a Gaan Gadu shrine. In 1972, a road was built to connect Wanhatti to the East-West Link. The road partially uses the path of the old defence line, build between 1770 and 1778 to protect the plantations of the Colony of Suriname against attacks by the Maroons. The road improved conditions in the village, and it now has a school, and a connection to the telephone network. The Surinamese Interior War fought during the 1980s left its toll on the resort, and caused a large part of the population to flee. In September 2010, a health care clinic was opened in the village. In 2011, the road was extended to reach the village Lantiwee, and it is hoped that this will lead to a return of farmers in the area. On 3 June 2011, a library was opened in the village. Besides Wanhatti itself, the resort contains among others the villages of Lantiwee, Pikin Santi, Pinatjaimi, and Tamarin. Aluku Maroons Fort Buku, a famous Aluku Maroon fort of the Boni War that fell in 1772, is located within the Wanhatti resort, however the fort itself still has to be discovered as of 2020. The Ndyuka signed a peace treaty in 1760. Boni also desired a peace treaty, but the Society of Suriname, despite contrary advice from the Dutch government, wanted to persecute and destroy the Aluku. In 1777, the French send a diplomatic mission to Suriname, to discuss the refugee crisis.

Lord Oxburgh is well known for his work as a public advocate in both academia and the business world in addressing the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and develop alternative energy sources as well as his negative views on the consequences of current oil consumption. Early life Oxburgh was born in Liverpool on 2 November 1934. He remained there with his family throughout World War II, despite Luftwaffe air raids. He attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1942 to 1950. He is a graduate of the University College, Oxford and Princeton University (PhD) (1960) where he worked on the emerging theory of plate tectonics with the famous geologist Harry Hammond Hess.http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/about/welcome/HHH.pdf Career Oxburgh has taught geology and geophysics at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. At Cambridge he was head of the Department of Earth Sciences and President of Queens' College. He has been a visiting professor at Stanford, Caltech, and Cornell. From 1988 to 1993, Lord Oxburgh was chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, and Rector of Imperial College London from 1993‚Äì2000.The Lord Oxburgh, KBE, FRS: Rector 1993‚Äì2000 He was a member of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education that published an influential report in 1997. During 2004‚Äì05 Oxburgh was a non-executive chairman of Shell, the UK arm of Royal Dutch Shell. His tenure was remarkable in that while chairing a fossil fuels giant he expressed his \\"fears for the planet\\" because of climate change, sought new energy sources, and urged the global community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Lord Oxburgh was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Science and Engineering Research Council (Singapore), as of 1 January 2002, and is a member of the International Academic Advisory Panel of Singapore and the University Grants Committee (Hong Kong). He is honorary president of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, chairman of Falck Renewables, a wind energy firm, an advisor to Climate Change Capital. He was chairman of D1 Oils, plc, a biodiesel producer, in 2007, and a director of GLOBE, the Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment. In March 2010, he was appointed as the chairman of an inquiry into the research conducted by the Climatic Research Unit following the Climatic Research Unit hacking incident. The report,http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/CRUstatements/SAP released 14 April 2010, found that \\"...work has been carried out with integrity, and that allegations of deliberate misrepresentation and unjustified selection of data are not valid.\\" Critics asserted Oxburgh's ties with businesses that stood to profit from the decision created a conflict of interest.

It was available in four body styles, most bodied by Charlesworth, and unusually, customers could not buy a chassis only. Most were sold in Dawson Blue with black wings.

Free-standing lean- to structures are generally used as shelters. One traditional type of lean-to is known by its Finnish name laavu. Lean-to buildings Lean-to made with car and tent A lean-to is originally defined as a building in which the rafters lean against another building or wall, a penthouse.\\"Lean-to\\" def. A. Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 These structures frequently have skillion rooves and as such are sometimes referred to as \\"skillions\\". A lean-to shelter is a free- standing structure with only three walls and a single-pitched roof. The open side is commonly oriented away from the prevailing winds and rains. Often it is a rough structure made of logs or unfinished wood and used as a camping shelter. A lean-to addition is a shed with a sloping roof and three walls that abuts the wall of another structure. This form of lean-to is generally provisional; it is an appendix to an existing building constructed to fulfill a new need. Sometimes, they cover external staircases, as is the case with the lean-to building built in the 15th century against one of the walls of the large chapter room of the cathedral of Meaux. Sometimes, they are built to protect entrances or to establish covered markets around certain large civic buildings.Dictionary of French Architecture from 11th to 16th Century (1856)  Laavu  A laavu in the Pukala recreational forest A Finnish laavu, Swedish gapskjul or slogbod, or Norwegian gapahuk is also a traditional, ethnic lean- to, a small structure intended for temporary residence during hiking or fishing trips in the wilderness. Laavus are commonly found in Finnish Lapland near popular fishing rivers and in national parks. In principle, a laavu is a simplified version of a wilderness hut. Like wilderness huts, they are not heated, and may not be reserved beforehand. Unlike wilderness huts, laavus lack doors or windows. A typical laavu is a wooden hut, about 10 m2 in area and 2 m high, consisting of a roof, floor, and three walls. The fourth wall is left permanently open. A laavu provides a safe place to sleep during fishing or hiking trips. Visitors are expected to bring their own sleeping bags, as the area has no other sleeping facilities. Most laavus also have a space for a campfire in front of them, but the laavu is built so that a reasonable fire can provide warmth for the night. They are also commonly used as a rest stop along trails during daytime, and for camping cookout (which in Finland usually consists of grilling sausage on the campfire). A laavu can also be an improvised structure of the same type, built out of available materials such as branches with leaves or pine/fir needles intact, or moss or animal pelts for the covering, and sturdier, stripped branches or young tree trunks as the supporting structure. These serve as temporary shelters deep in the wilderness, usually for a single overnight stay. This is the traditional meaning of the word. Traditionally, a log fire was used, made so that it did not need surveillance during the night (rakovalkea in Finnish, nying in Swedish and Norwegian). In the United States, this same type of structure is commonly referred to as an \\"Adirondack\\". Many youth camps use such structures to provide an inexpensive shelter for campers that is sturdier, and more durable, than a textile tent. A simple tarp shelter Laavu-like tents are also sold, meant for four or five people. Some of the modern nylon ones have a front flap that is pulled down for the night if there is no fire.

Leaving home at a young age, he first lived with the Christians in Palestine, before eventually being expelled from that community and adopting the life of a Cynic philosopher and eventually settling in Greece. He is most remembered for committing suicide after giving his own funeral oration,\\"On the Love of Suicide\\" by Renee Winegarten ‚Äî August 1972 cremating himself on a funeral pyre at the Olympic Games in 165. By 180 AD, a statue of Peregrinus had been erected in his home city of Parium; it was reputed to have oracular powers.Athenagoras, Presbeia peri Christianon, 26. Life =Lucian's satirical biography= The only detailed account of the life of Peregrinus was recorded by Lucian in his satire, The Death of Peregrinus (). Although this account is hostile to Peregrinus, the bare facts of his life can be extracted. Peregrinus was born in Parium, c. 95 AD. At a young age he was suspected of parricide, and was obliged to leave his native home.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 10. During his wanderings he reached Palestine, he came into close contact with the Christian community, and quickly rose to a position of authority.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 11. He suffered a term of imprisonment at the hands of the Roman authorities, during which the Christians gave him much aid.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 12, 13. He may have expected to be martyred, but the Governor of Syria released him.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 14. He seems to have become a Cynic at this point, because he returned home and renounced his inheritance, giving away all his money to the people of his home city.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 15. He resumed his wandering life, maintaining close relations with the Christians at first, but eventually he offended them in some way, and was expelled from the Christian community.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 16. He went to Egypt to study with the famous Cynic Agathobulus, where he learned the harsh asceticism of the sect.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 17. He made his way to Rome, where he began a campaign of abuse against the Roman authorities, and especially the emperor Antoninus Pius.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 18. He gained a following among the masses, and it may be at this point that Theagenes became his chief disciple. Although tolerated at first, he was eventually expelled by the City Prefect. He next went to Elis in Greece, where he continued his anti-Roman preaching.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 19. At the Olympic games (either 153 or 157), Peregrinus abused the wealthy philanthropist Herodes Atticus, whereby the infuriated crowd attacked Peregrinus, and he was forced to take refuge at the altar of Zeus.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 19, 20. In Athens, Peregrinus devoted himself to the study and teaching of philosophy, and obtained a considerable number of pupils, amongst them Aulus Gellius.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, xii. 11. At the Olympic Games of 161, he announced that he would publicly burn himself to death at the following Olympics:Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 20. > He said that he wanted to put a tip of gold on a golden life; for one who > had lived as Heracles should die like Heracles and be commingled with the > aether. And I wish, said he, to benefit mankind by showing them the way in > which one should disregard death; wherefore all men ought to play > Philoctetes to my Heracles.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 33. He carried out his promise: on the final night of the Olympic games in 165, he immolated himself on a funeral pyre located 20 stadia (3.7 km) east of Olympia.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 35-36. Lucian, who was present, witnessed the event, having heard Theagenes, Peregrinus' most ardent disciple, praise his master's intentions. It is hard to reconstruct Peregrinus' own motivations for the events of his life, because Lucian, for general and personal reasons, presents a hostile view of Peregrinus. According to Lucian, Peregrinus strangled his father to death; became a Christian so that he could gain wealth; was imprisoned so that he could gain notoriety; gave his inheritance away so that he might gain favour among the people of his home town; studied under Agathobulus so that he could become more obscene; attacked the Romans to become famous; and killed himself to become infamous. =Gellius's account= Aulus Gellius provides a brief, but different, view of Peregrinus. He describes Peregrinus as \\"a man of dignity and fortitude,\\" and Aulus would regularly visit him in his hut outside Athens where he would listen to things which were \\"helpful and noble\\": > He used to say that a wise man would not commit a sin, even if he knew that > neither gods nor men would know it; for he thought that one ought to refrain > from sin, not through fear of punishment or disgrace, but from love of > justice and honesty and from a sense of duty. =Ammianus Marcellinus's allusion= Ammianus Marcellinus also refers positively to Peregrinus, albeit briefly. Describing the execution of the 4th century philosopher Simonides, burnt alive in the reign of the Emperor Valens, Ammianus compares Simonides with Peregrinus: > Simonides, ... to whom death was an escape from the grim tyrant life, and > who laughed at sudden disastrous turns of fate, stood unmoved amid the > flames, like the famous philosopher Peregrinus, nicknamed Proteus. He, > having decided to leave the world, mounted a pyre which he had built himself > at the quinquennial Olympic games, and was consumed by fire while the whole > of Greece looked onAmmianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, XXIX.1.38-'9 =Modern reconstructions= Several modern historians have attempted to outline Peregrinus' life using the works of Lucian and other sources that have fixed historical dates such as the completion of Herodes Atticus' aqueduct and the Jewish revolt in Syria. One of the more complete timelines of Peregrinus Proteus' life comes from Gilbert Bagnani. His timeline for Peregrinus' life goes like so: > ca. 95 birth at Parium > 114‚Äì116 in Armenia > ca. 120 at Parium: death of his father > 120‚Äì130 goes to Palestine and Syria: joins Essene-Ebionite Church at Pella > 132 imprisoned on the outbreak of the Jewish revolt > 134 released by Julius Severus > 135 after his return to Parium resumes his travels > ca. 140 excommunicated as an Ebionite: goes to Egypt > ca. 150 goes to Rome > ca. 152 expelled from Rome > 153 attacks Herodes Atticus at Olympia > 157 is reconciled to Herodes > 165 his death at Olympia.

He was educated for the church of Rome, and from 1866 to 1869 he was superintendent at the College de la Paix, Namur. In 1870 he entered the Jesuit Training College at the old abbey of Maria Laach in the Eifel, and there, while engaged in studying philosophy and science, he became interested in the geology of the district, and especially in the volcanic rocks. Thenceforth he worked at chemistry and mineralogy, and qualified himself for those petrographical researches for which he was distinguished. In 1874 he became professor of chemistry and geology in the college of the Belgian Jesuits at Leuven, a few years later he was appointed one of the curators of the Royal Natural History Museum at Brussels, and in 1882 he relinquished his post at Louvain. In 1888 he was chosen professor of geology at the University of Ghent, and retained the post until the close of his life. Meanwhile, he had been ordained priest in 1877, and had intended to enter the Society of Jesus. He was known as the Abb√© Renard; but, as remarked by Sir A. Geikie, as years passed, the longing for mental freedom grew ever stronger, until at last it overmastered all the traditions and associations of a lifetime, and he finally separated himself from the church of Rome. His first work, written in conjunction with Charles-Louis-Joseph-Xavier de la Vall√©e-Poussin (1827‚Äì1904), was the M√©moire sur les caract√®res min√©ralogiques et stratigraphiques des roches dues plutoniennes de la Belgique et de l'Ardenne fran√ßaise (1876). In later essays and papers he dealt with the structure and mineral composition of many igneous and sedimentary rocks, and with the phenomena of metamorphism in Belgium and other countries. In acknowledgment of his work, the Bigsby Medal was awarded to him in 1885 by the Geological Society of London. Still more important were his later researches connected with the Challenger Expedition. The various rock specimens and oceanic deposits were submitted to him for examination in association with Sir John Murray, and their detailed observations were embodied in the Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger Deep Sea Deposits (1891). The more striking additions to our knowledge included the detection and description of cosmic dust, which as fine rain slowly accumulates on the ocean floor; the development of zeolitic crystals on the sea-bottom at temperatures of 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C) and under; and the distribution and mode of occurrence of manganese nodules and of phosphatic and glauconite deposits on the bed of the ocean. Renard died at Brussels on 9 July 1903. Rue Alphonse Renard,Google map. in western Ixelles, is named in his honor. In addition, the mineral renardite was named in his honor in 1928.

He gained notoriety for the murders of three young children in Toronto in the late 1950s, as well as for a murder in 1991 on his first day of unsupervised release from the psychiatric institution in which he had been incarcerated for his earlier crimes. An adopted child, Krueger lived in numerous foster homes as an infant, and showed signs of severe emotional trauma when he found a permanent foster home at the age of 3. Unable to adjust to social situations, he was bullied by his peers. He would often wander from his home by foot, bicycle or train to parts of Toronto, where he would molest dozens of children, and ultimately murder three. Found not guilty by reason of insanity for his crimes, he was sent to a psychiatric facility. Psychiatrists placed him in experimental treatment programs for psychopathy, but those treatments proved ineffective when he murdered a fellow psychiatric patient in 1991; after his death in 2010, he was described in the Toronto Star as \\"the serial killer they couldn't cure.\\"  Early life  Peter Woodcock was born in Peterborough, Ontario to a 17-year-old factory worker, Waita Woodcock, who gave him up for adoption after breastfeeding him for a month. Adoption agency records report that the newborn, Peter, showed feeding problems and cried constantly. As an infant, he stayed in various foster homes, unable to bond with any of his foster parents. After his first birthday, he became terrified of anybody approaching him, and his speech was incoherent‚Äîdescribed as strange whining animal noises. He was also physically abused by at least one of his early foster parents, with a 2-year-old Woodcock having to be given medical treatment for an injured neck after receiving a beating. He was placed into a stable home at the age of 3, to foster parents Frank and Susan Maynard‚Äîan upper-middle-class couple with another son. Susan Maynard, who was described as a \\"forceful woman with an exaggerated sense of propriety\\", became strongly attached to the maladjusted child who would still scream when someone approached him. By the age of 5, Woodcock would no longer scream when approached, but he remained socially maladjusted and became the target of neighbourhood bullies. He often wandered far away from his neighbourhood, once being found cowering in some bushes, in an attempt to hide from other children. Worried about the child's fragile emotional state, Frank and Susan Maynard would regularly bring him to the Hospital for Sick Children, where Woodcock received extensive treatment. Woodcock was sent to a private school, but again failed to make friends or interact successfully with his peers and remained isolated. By the age of 11, he was described as an \\"angry little boy\\"; a Children's Aid Society report on him from that time read: Signs of Woodcock's violent fantasies were present at this time also, seen when a social worker was walking with him at the Canadian National Exhibition and Woodcock muttered, \\"I wish a bomb would fall on the Exhibition and kill all the children\\". Woodcock was sent to a school for emotionally disturbed children in Kingston, Ontario, and began acting on his strong sexual urges with other children‚Äîwith Woodcock stating that here he had consensual intercourse with a 12-year-old girl when he was 13. When he turned 15, he was discharged from this school and returned to live with his foster parents, but was soon re-enrolled at his original private school, where he again failed to connect with his peers. At the age of 16, he left the private school again and was sent to a public high school, where children from the neighborhood instantly recognized him and resumed the bullying; he transferred to a private high school six weeks later. While his peers again shunned him, his teachers there remembered him as a very bright student who excelled in science, history, and English, and who frequently scored 100 percent on his tests.  Early crimes  Peter Woodcock's prized possession was a red and white Schwinn bicycle on which he satisfied his continuing compulsion to wander. He rode the bike to the far reaches of the city‚Äîeven during the deep, cold Toronto winters‚Äîand evolved a fantasy in which he led a gang of 500 invisible boys on bikes called the 'Winchester Heights Gang'. His foster parents were aware of this fantasy and his compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that he had begun traveling around Toronto on his bike and sexually assaulting children. = Murder of Wayne Mallette = On September 15, 1956, Woodcock was riding his bike around the grounds of the Exhibition Place when he met 7-year-old Wayne Mallette. He lured the boy out of sight and then proceeded to strangle him to death. Mallette's body was found in the early hours of September 16. He was dressed in a British schoolboy blazer, shirt and plaid trousers. It appeared that his clothing had been removed and he had then been re-dressed. His face was pushed into the dirt and two bite marks were found on the body‚Äîone on the boy's calf and the other on his buttock. There was no evidence of rape, however. Pennies were found ritualistically scattered near the body. Woodcock had defecated next to the victim as well. Toronto Police initially arrested and interrogated another boy, Ron Moffatt. Through relentless questioning they extracted a confession from then 14-year old Moffatt. Despite witnesses who clearly placed him in a movie theatre before and after the murder of Wayne Mallette, he was found guilty and sentenced to youth detention. Eventually police acknowledged there was a serial predator in Toronto, but Moffatt was not released. However, when notes were shared between forces, Woodcock was arrested. After his conviction, Woodcock was called as a defense witness for Moffatt. The wrongful murder charge was stayed in 1957, and Moffatt was released from custody. Nate Hendley published in 2018 an account of Moffatt's experience, The Boy on the Bicycle. = Murder of Gary Morris = On October 6, 1956, Woodcock was riding his bike around Cabbagetown when he picked up 9-year-old Gary Morris. He then drove the boy to Cherry Beach, where he strangled and beat him to death‚Äîwith a coroner later determining that Morris had died from a ruptured liver. Morris' body was found with a bite mark on his throat and, this time, paper clips seemed to have been ritualistically sprinkled near the corpse. Again, the clothing had been removed from the victim and then he had been re-dressed. = Murder of Carole Voyce = On January 19, 1957, Woodcock was again riding his bike when he approached 4-year-old Carole Voyce and offered her a ride. He then drove her under the Bloor Viaduct and murdered her. When she was found, her clothes had been pulled off. It appeared that she had been choked into unconsciousness and sexually molested, and that her death was caused by a tree branch being forcibly inserted into her vagina.  Apprehension and trial  Witnesses saw a teenager cycling away from Carole Voyce's crime scene and an accurate composite sketch was created based on those witnesses' descriptions. This sketch ran on the front page of the Toronto Star and would lead to Woodcock's arrest on January 21, 1957, and his subsequent confession to all three murders. He recalled upon his arrest: \\"My fear was that Mother would find out. Mother was my biggest fear. I didn't know if the police would let her at me.\\" Woodcock was tried only for the murder of Carole Voyce. On April 11, 1957, after a four-day trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Oak Ridge division of the maximum-security Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene, Ontario.  Imprisonment  While imprisoned, Woodcock was diagnosed as a psychopath. He underwent various forms of psychiatric therapy, including LSD treatments when they were popular in the 1960s. He was also given other personality-breaking drugs: scopolamine, sodium amytal, methedrine and dexamyl. He was subjected to \\"dyads\\"‚Äîa personality- breaking therapy in which inmates challenged each other's belief systems‚Äîwhich inmates referred to as \\"The Hundred-Day Hate-In\\". Dyads were developed in the late 1950s to early 1960s by a Harvard psychologist and former CIA interrogation and psychological warfare expert, Henry A. Murray. In the 1960s, one of Murray's volunteer personality-destruction subjects had been a young Harvard student‚ÄîTed Kaczynski, the future Unabomber. Woodcock did not respond well to these treatments, and was not an ideal prisoner. He engaged in coercive sexual acts and exploited his fellow inmates, who were often less intelligent or less sane than he was. He formed an imaginary gang, the Brotherhood. He convinced inmates that he had contact with the mythical group on the outside, and that in order to be initiated, inmates had to perform oral sex on him and bring him gifts of cigarettes. Woodcock was eventually transferred to less restrictive institutions, and ultimately arrived at the Brockville Psychiatric Hospital. Here, staff indulged his passion for trains by taking him to the Smiths Falls Railway Museum, and even took him to see The Silence of the Lambs. During this time, he legally changed his name to David Michael Krueger and rekindled a relationship with Bruce Hamill, an Ottawa killer who had been released from Oak Ridge and was working as a security guard at the Ottawa courthouse. Krueger convinced Hamill an alien brotherhood would solve his problems if he helped kill another Brockville inmate, Dennis Kerr. = Murder of Dennis Kerr = On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill went to a hardware store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives, and a sleeping bag, then went to the Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted day pass. During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars. When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in. = Death = For the murder of Dennis Kerr, Krueger was transferred back to the Oak Ridge division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, where he had spent the majority of his 34 preceding years in custody. In the years after Kerr's murder, he was the focus of a biography and several documentary films and sometimes tried to explain why he killed, but he never came up with rational reasons. He said in a 1993 interview: \\"I'm accused of having no morality, which is a fair assessment, because my morality is whatever the system allows.\\" On March 5, 2010, his 71st birthday, Krueger died of natural causes.

The term comes from the meta prefix's modern meaning of an abstract recursion, or \\"X about X\\", similar to its use in metaknowledge, metamemory, and meta-emotion.  Overview  Meta learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as \\"the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized\\".Maudsley, D. B. (1979). A Theory of Meta-Learning and Principles of Facilitation: An Organismic Perspective. University of Toronto, 1979. (40, 8,4354-4355-A) Maudsley sets the conceptual basis of his theory as synthesized under headings of assumptions, structures, change process, and facilitation. Five principles were enunciated to facilitate meta learning. Learners must: :(a) have a theory, however primitive; :(b) work in a safe supportive social and physical environment; :(c) discover their rules and assumptions; :(d) reconnect with reality-information from the environment; and :(e) reorganize themselves by changing their rules/assumptions. The idea of meta learning was later used by John Biggs (1985) to describe the state of \\"being aware of and taking control of one's own learning\\".Biggs, J. B. (1985). The role of meta-learning in study process. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 55, 185‚Äì212. Meta learning can be defined as an awareness and understanding of the phenomenon of learning itself as opposed to subject knowledge. Implicit in this definition is the learner's perception of the learning context, which includes knowing what the expectations of the discipline are and, more narrowly, the demands of a given learning task. Within this context, meta learning depends on the learner's conceptions of learning, epistemological beliefs, learning processes and academic skills, summarized here as a \\"learning approach\\". A student who has a high level of meta learning awareness is able to assess the effectiveness of their learning approach and regulate it according to the demands of the learning task. Conversely, a student who is low in meta learning awareness will not be able to reflect on their learning approach or the nature of the learning task set. In consequence, the student will be unable to adapt successfully when studying becomes more difficult and demanding.(Norton et al. 2004) Conceptually, meta learning is a mixture of understanding, processes, and attitudes. It includes the self-knowledge about how one learns, particularly an awareness of the learning strategies and behaviors applicable to a learning context (Jackson 2004; Bostr√∂m and Lassen 2006). It also includes 'knowledge of completion', in which learners develop an appreciation of the knowledge that they have gained and an understanding of how to use this knowledge (Bostr√∂m and Lassen 2006). Meta learning also relates to learners' attitudes, such as their belief that the way they self-regulate is the best way for them, and that they have the capacities and skills to apply their knowledge (Jackson 2004). Based on this perspective, meta learning is an active, internal process in which a learner's point of view regarding themselves and their surroundings will change and be regulated (Bostr√∂m and Lassen 2006; Winters 2011). Engaging effectively in meta learning has been shown to improve academic performance (Biggs 1985). It has been suggested that aiding the metacognition of learning can help students to become more effective learners, as they become more aware of self-regulatory behaviours and begin to recognise the effectiveness of various strategies they use (Jackson 2004). Meta learning can also be a very effective tool to assist students in becoming independently self-reflective (Biggs 1985; Winters 2011). As meta learning relates to students' self-awareness regarding their learning processes, it is closely aligned to the self-regulation of learning (Zimmerman 2002; Winne 2010); that is, the thoughts, feelings and actions that students use to help them attain their academic goals (Zimmerman 2000). Meta learning model for teams and relationships Marcial Losada and other researchers have attempted to create a meta learning model to analyze teams and relationships.(Losada, 1999; Losada & Heaphy, 2004; Fredrickson & Losada, 2005) A 2013 paper provided a strong critiqueBrown, N. J. L., Sokal, A. D., & Friedman, H. L. (2013). The Complex Dynamics of Wishful Thinking: The Critical Positivity Ratio. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print. of this attempt, arguing that it was based on misapplication of complex mathematical modelling. This led to its abandonment by at least one former proponent.Fredrickson, B. L. (2013) Updated thinking on positivity ratios. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print. The meta learning model proposed by Losada is identical to the Lorenz system, which was originally proposed as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. It comprises one control parameter and three state variables, which in this case have been mapped to \\"connectivity\\", \\"inquiry-advocacy\\", \\"positivity-negativity\\", and \\"other-self\\" (external-internal focus) respectively. The state variables are linked by a set of nonlinear differential equations.(Losada, 1999; Fredrickson & Losada, 2005; for a graphical representation of the meta learning model see Losada & Heaphy, 2004) This has been criticized as a poorly defined, poorly justified, and invalid application of differential equations. Losada and colleagues claim to have arrived at the meta learning model from thousands of time series data generated at two human interaction laboratories in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, although the details of the collection of this data, and the connection between the time series data and the model is unclear. These time series portrayed the interaction dynamics of business teams doing typical business tasks such as strategic planning. These teams were classified into three performance categories: high, medium and low. Performance was evaluated by the profitability of the teams, the level of satisfaction of their clients, and 360-degree evaluations. One proposed result of this theory is that there is a ratio of positivity-to-negativity of at least 2.9 (called the Losada line), which separates high from low performance teams as well as flourishing from languishing in individuals and relationships.(Fredrickson & Losada, 2005; Waugh & Fredrickson, 2006; Fredrickson, 2009) Brown and colleagues pointed out that even if the proposed meta-learning model were valid, this ratio results from a completely arbitrary choice of model parameters carried over from the literature on modeling atmospheric convection by Lorenz and others, without any justification. Ideas for implementation and goals Meta learning can also be a very effective tool to assist students in becoming independently self-reflective. Students will require feedback in order to reflect on their learning, strengths, and weaknesses. Meta learning tasks will help students be more proactive and effective learners by focusing on developing self-awareness. Meta learning tasks would provide students with the opportunity to better understand their thinking processes in order to devise custom learning strategies. The goal is to find a set of parameters that work well across different tasks so that learners start with a bias that allows them to perform well despite receiving only a small amount of task- specific data. Tim Ferriss's DiSSS System Tim Ferriss created a four stem system which he argues can be used to learn anything. : a. Deconstruction: Breaking down a skill, what are the bare minimum learnable components? : b. Selection: Which 20% of these components should be focused on to give 80% of the desired outcomes? : c. Sequencing: In what order should these units be learned to maximize outcomes and avoid failure? : d. Stakes: What stakes can be created to push past difficulties and guarantee completion of learning?

Dorling Kindersley. 624 pp. . but can grow to a maximum of . The body is muscular with a flattened profile, while the tail tapers to a thin point. The top of the head is covered by large, symmetrical scales. The dorsal scales, which are smooth and glossy, number 50-65 rows at midbody, while 315-355 ventral scales occur. The tail has 60-75 mainly single subcaudal scales and the anal scale is single. The posterior subcaudals tend to be divided, often irregularly. The color pattern consists of shades of black, dark grey, brown, gold, and cream arranged in a striped or brindled pattern. The belly is light-colored, flecked with darker spots. The head is shiny black that also extends down the neck and throat for several inches. Distribution and habitat The species is found in Australia in the northern half of the country, excluding the very arid regions. The type locality given is \\"Port Denison Bowen\\" Queensland, Australia. It occurs in humid tropical to semiarid conditions. A black-headed python seeking warmth on a road near Borroloola on a cold morning Behaviour These snakes are terrestrial and are often found in amongst rocks and loose debris. If disturbed, they hiss loudly, but are unlikely to bite unless hunting prey. They sometimes strike with a closed mouth, but generally can be handled easily. They are strong swimmers, but are almost never found in water. They are not venomous. Feeding The diet consists mainly of reptiles, including snakes, but they will eat mammals if available. Because black-headed pythons live in the desert, they heat up quicker and stay warmer for longer. This means they can eat more because they digest food quicker in warmer conditions. When ingesting large prey, this species positions one or two coils just ahead of its distended mouth and by constriction makes the task of swallowing easier. Reproduction Oviparous, females lay five to 10 eggs per clutch. The females stay coiled about the eggs and incubate them until they hatch, which is usually after 2‚Äì3 months. The young take small prey as soon as 2 days after hatching. Immature individuals are vulnerable to predation, including cannibalism. Adults have no natural predators other than dingos and humans. Captivity Due to its docile nature and striking color pattern, this species has become very desirable as an exotic pet. It is bred in captivity and can be relatively easily obtained, but does command a high price. As they can be muscular snakes and reach a fairly substantial size, prospective owners should consider a suitable enclosure, as well as temperature and feeding requirements. In human culture These snakes are mentioned in, or play a central role in, the stories of the Indigenous Australians Dreamtime tradition. References Further reading *Boulenger, G.A. 1893.

Padden, who served as the organization's chairman until 1995. Padden had been a director of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C., since its founding as the Charles Koch Foundation in 1974. Padden was also a former director of Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Acton Institute, the Foundation for Economic Education, and the Center for Libertarian Studies. At age 26, Joseph L. Bast became Heartland's first employee. Bast's wife Diane was Heartland's publications director. In the 1990s, Heartland worked with the tobacco company Philip Morris to question serious cancer risks to secondhand smoke, and to lobby against government public-health regulations. Starting in 2008, Heartland has organized conferences to question the scientific consensus on climate change. After the election of U.S. President Barack Obama in November 2008, the Institute became involved with the Tea Party movement. According to the organization's director of communications, speaking at the sixth International Conference on Climate Change in 2011: \\"The support of the Tea Party groups across the country has been extremely valuable.\\" Heartland was among the organizers of the September 2009 Tea Party protest march, the Taxpayer March on Washington. In support of the Tea Party movement, Heartland offered free literature and other assistance to Tea Party activists, created a website \\"www.teapartytoolbox.org\\", and distributed a free book, The Patriot's Toolbox. Heartland says it has a full- time staff of 29, including editors and senior fellows, as well as 222 unpaid policy advisers. Heartland is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity. It reported revenues of $4.8 million in 2013. In March, 2020, Heartland laid off staff, reportedly in response to financial issues. Policy positions According to the Institute, it advocates free market policies. The policy orientation of Heartland has been described as conservative, libertarian, and right wing.It also has been described as right-wing. See, for example:  * Roberts, Alasdair Scott, Blacked out: government secrecy in the information age, (2006) Cambridge University Press, p. 253, via GoogleBooks. , The Institute promotes climate change denial, advocates for smoker's rights, for the privatization of public resources including school privatization, for school vouchers, for lower taxes and against subsidies and tax credits for individual businesses, and against an expanded federal role in health care, among other issues. In addition to lobbying activities, Heartland hosts an internet application called \\"Policybot\\" which serves as a clearinghouse for research from other conservative organizations such as The Heritage Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and the Cato Institute. =Tobacco regulation= Heartland has long questioned the links between tobacco smoking, secondhand smoke, and lung cancer and the social costs imposed by smokers. One of Heartland's first campaigns was against tobacco regulation. According to the Los Angeles Times, Heartland's advocacy for the tobacco industry is one of the two things Heartland is most widely known for. During the 1990s, the Institute worked with tobacco company Philip Morris to question the links between smoking, secondhand smoke and health risks. Philip Morris commissioned Heartland to write and distribute reports. Heartland published a policy study which summarized a jointly prepared report by the Association of Private Enterprise Education and Philip Morris. The Institute also undertook a variety of other activities on behalf of the tobacco industry, including meeting with legislators, holding off-the-record briefings, and producing op-eds, radio interviews, and letters. A 1993 internal \\"Five Year Plan\\" from Philip Morris to address environmental tobacco smoke regulation called for support for the efforts of the Institute. In 1996, Heartland president and chief executive officer Joe Bast wrote an essay entitled \\"Joe Camel is Innocent!,\\" which said that contributions from the tobacco industry to Republican political campaigns were most likely because Republicans \\"have been leading the fight against the use of 'junk science' by the Food and Drug Administration and its evil twin, the Environmental Protection Agency.\\" In the \\"President's Letter\\" in the July 1998 issue of The Heartlander, the Institute's magazine, Bast wrote an essay \\"Five Lies about Tobacco\\", which said \\"smoking in moderation has few, if any, adverse health effects.\\" In 1999, Bast referenced the essays in soliciting financial support from Philip Morris, writing \\"Heartland does many things that benefit Philip Morris' bottom line, things that no other organization does.\\" A Philip Morris executive, the firm's manager of industrial affairs, was a member of the board of directors of the Institute. In 2005, the Institute opposed Chicago's public smoking ban, at the time one of the strictest bans in the country. =Climate change= The Institute rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, claims that the amount of climate change is not catastrophic, claims that climate change might be beneficial, and that the economic costs of trying to mitigate climate change exceed the benefits. According to The New York Times, Heartland is \\"the primary American organization pushing climate change skepticism.\\" The Institute has been a member of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group dedicated to denying climate change science, since 1997. Institute staff \\"recognize that climate change is a profound threat to our economic and social systems and therefore deny its scientific reality,\\" wrote Naomi Klein in This Changes Everything. In their 2010 book Merchants of Doubt, Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway wrote that the Institute was known \\"for its persistent questioning of climate science, for its promotion of 'experts' who have done little, if any, peer-reviewed climate research, and for its sponsorship of a conference in New York City in 2008 alleging that the scientific community's work on global warming is fake.\\" The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society in a chapter \\"Organized Climate Change Denial\\" identified Heartland as a conservative think tank with a strong interest in environmental and climate issues involved in climate change denial. Heartland \\"emerged as a leading force in climate change denial\\" in the decade 2003‚Äì2013, according to sociology professor Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State University and political science professor Peter J. Jacques of the University of Central Florida. Historians James Morton Turner and Andrew Isenberg describe Heartland as a leader in the \\"scientific misinformation campaign\\" against climate change. Fred Singer is the director of Heartland's Science and Environmental Policy Project, and Heartland is a member organization of the Cooler Heads Coalition. \\"Heartland's influence on national climate policy is at an apex\\" in March 2017 according to PBS Frontline. Heartland's list of scientists said to doubt global warming In 2008, the Institute published a list purporting to identify \\"500 Scientists with Documented Doubts of Man-Made Global Warming Scares\\". The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the work of Jim Salinger, chief scientist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, was \\"misrepresented\\" as part of a \\"denial campaign\\". In response to criticism, the Institute changed the title of the list to \\"500 Scientists Whose Research Contradicts Man-Made Global Warming Scares.\\" Heartland did not remove any scientist's name from the list. Avery explained, \\"Not all of these researchers would describe themselves as global warming skeptics...but the evidence in their studies is there for all to see.\\" The Institute's then president, Joseph Bast, argued that the scientists \\"have no right‚Äîlegally or ethically‚Äîto demand that their names be removed\\" from Heartland's list. Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change and Climate Change Reconsidered Since 2008, Heartland has published the work of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an international group of scientists who analyze the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other published, peer-reviewed studies that relate to climate change. The aggregated work of the NIPCC is known as \\"Climate Change Reconsidered\\" and concludes, in contradiction to the IPCC and the consensus of the scientific community, that human emissions will not lead to dangerous global warming and climate change. International Conferences on Climate Change Heartland's conventions of climate change doubters are one of the things the institute is largely known for, according to the Los Angeles Times. Between 2008 and 2019 the Institute has organized thirteen International Conferences on Climate Change, bringing together hundreds of global warming skeptics. Conference speakers have included Richard Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at MIT; Roy Spencer, a research scientist and climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville; S. Fred Singer, a senior fellow of the Institute and who was founding dean of the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences at the University of Miami and founding director of the National Weather Satellite Service; Harrison Schmitt, a geologist and former NASA astronaut and Apollo 17 moonwalker; Dr. John Theon, atmospheric scientist and former NASA supervisor; and Wei-Hock \\"Willie\\" Soon, a part-time employee of the Solar and Stellar Physics (SSP) Division of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. In the first conference, participants criticized the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore. In 2010 the BBC reported that the heavily politicized nature of the Heartland conferences led some \\"moderate\\" climate skeptics to avoid them. In an article in The Nation, the 6th conference was described as \\"the premier gathering for those dedicated to denying the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is warming the planet\\". The 7th conference (May 2012) was the main subject of the October 2012 documentary, Climate of Doubt, by Frontline, a public television series of original, in-depth documentaries. At the conclusion of the 7th conference, Joseph Bast announced that the organization might discontinue the conferences, but the eighth conference was held in Munich, Germany later the same year (30 November and 1 December 2012). The ninth conference was held during July 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 2015 tenth conference was held in Washington D.C. Speakers and panelists at the 2017 twelfth conference included Bast, Soon, Christopher Monckton, marketing professor J. Scott Armstrong, retired astronaut Walter Cunningham, policy analyst Indur M. Goklany, physicist William Happer, geologist Don Easterbrook, and U. S. Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX), chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. The 2019 thirteenth conference was held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.  May 2012 \\"Unabomber\\" billboard campaign  On Thursday May 3, 2012, Heartland launched an advertising campaign in the Chicago area, and put up digital billboards along the Eisenhower Expressway in Maywood, Illinois, featuring a photo of Ted Kaczynski, the \\"Unabomber\\" whose mail bombs killed three people and injured 23 others, asking the question, \\"I still believe in global warming, do you?\\" They withdrew the billboards a day later. The Institute planned for the campaign to feature murderer Charles Manson, communist leader Fidel Castro and perhaps Osama bin Laden, asking the same question. The Institute justified the billboards saying \\"the most prominent advocates of global warming aren't scientists. They are murderers, tyrants, and madmen.\\" The billboard reportedly \\"unleashed a social media-fed campaign, including a petition from the advocacy group Forecast the Facts calling on Heartland's corporate backers to immediately pull their funding,\\" and prompted Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) to threaten to cancel his speech at the upcoming seventh International Conference on Climate Change organized by Heartland. Sensenbrenner ultimately did speak at the conference. Within 24 hours Heartland cancelled the campaign, although its president refused to apologize for it. The advertising campaign led to the resignation of two of the Institute's 12 board members, and the resignation of almost the entire Heartland Washington D.C. office, taking the Institute's biggest project (on insurance) with it. The staff of the former Heartland insurance project founded the R Street Institute and announced they \\"will not promote climate change skepticism.\\" Following the 2012 document leak and the controversial billboard campaign, substantial funding was lost as corporate donors, including the General Motors Foundation, sought to dissociate themselves from the Institute. According to the advocacy group Forecast the Facts, Heartland lost more than $825,000, or one third of planned corporate fundraising for the year. The shortfall led to sponsorship of the Institute's May 2012 climate conference by Illinois' coal lobby, the Illinois Coal Association, the Institute's \\"first publicly acknowledged donations from the coal industry,\\" and the Heritage Foundation.Goldenberg, Suzanne, \\"Heartland Institute facing uncertain future as staff depart and cash dries up\\", guardian.co.uk, May 20, 2012. The billboard controversy led to the loss of substantial corporate funding, including telecommunications firm AT&T;, financial service firm BB&T;, alcoholic beverage company Diageo and about two dozen insurance companies, including State Farm and the United Services Automobile Association. Pharmaceutical companies Amgen, Eli Lilly, Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline ended financial support. Heartland's May, 2012, climate conference was smaller than previous years. October 2012 repeal of mandates on renewable energy The Institute wrote model legislation to repeal mandates on renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and presented the model legislation to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States. ALEC's board of directors adopted the model legislation in October 2012. June 2013 Chinese Academy of Sciences In 2013, the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a report from the Heartland Institute in order to better understand the public debate and encourage discussion of other views. The preface included a disclaimer that the Academy did not endorse the views in the report, but in June, the Institute announced that the Chinese Academy of Sciences supported their views, and said the publication placed significant scientific weight against climate change. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, responding to the announcement, said \\"The claim of the Heartland Institute about CAS' endorsement of its report is completely false,\\" clarified that they did not endorse the views of the Institute, and asked for a retraction. April 2015 Vatican Council on climate change On April 28, 2015, the Catholic Church convened a council to discuss the religious implications of global warming. Held at the Vatican and hosted by the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, it was attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as well as national presidents, CEOs, academics, scientists, and representatives of the world's major religions. The Institute sent a delegation in an attempt to present a dissenting opinion. It held a \\"prebuttal\\" of the conference and argued that climate science does not justify papal recognition of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. After the council ended, a representative (Marc Morano) from the Institute broke into a press briefing being given by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was reporting on his meeting with the Pope. He interrupted the Secretary-General and the moderator, asking that global-warming skeptics be allowed to speak. After a few minutes, he was escorted from the premises by Vatican officials. In response to the papal encyclical \\"Laudato Si'\\", which outlined the Church's moral case for addressing climate change, and in anticipation of Pope Francis' September 2015 visit to the United States, Gene Koprowski, director of marketing for the Institute, suggested that the Pope's pronouncements on climate change indicate that \\"pagan forms are returning to the Church this day.\\" Center for Transforming Education In March 2017, the Institute's program the Center for Transforming Education began an unsolicited mailing of the Institute's book Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming and a companion DVD to all 200,000 K-12 science teachers in the U. S., with a cover letter giving a link to an online course planning guide. The material is not science and was intended to confuse teachers, according to the National Center for Science Education. =Privatization of government services= The Institute is a critic of current federal, state, and local budgets and tax codes. Several of Institute's budgetary views include privatization of federal services to a competitive marketplace, changing the tax code to a more simplified version of the current code, and implementing Taxpayer Savings Grants. In 1987, the Institute advocated for tenant ownership of the Chicago Housing Authority's Cabrini-Green Homes public housing complex through a cooperative or condominium conversion. In 1990, the Institute advocated for lower taxes in Illinois to foster job growth. The Institute advocated for the privatization of Illinois' toll highway system in 1999 and 2000. In 2008, the Institute opposed state subsidies and tax credits for local film productions, saying the economic benefits are less than the incentives. =Education= The Institute supports increased availability of (public) charter schools, education tax credits to attend private schools, and vouchers for low-income students to attend a public or private K‚Äì12 school of their family's choosing, as well as the Parent Trigger reform that started in California. The Institute supports the introduction of market reforms into the public K‚Äì12 education system to increase competition and provide more options and greater choice for parents and their children. In 1994, the Institute criticized the Chicago Public Schools' reform efforts and advocated privatization of public schools and school vouchers. In 2014, the Institute published Rewards: How to Use Rewards to Help Children Learn ‚Äì and Why Teachers Don't Use Them Well co-authored by Joseph Bast, which argued that the public education system should embrace incentives and rewards to spur student achievement. =Healthcare= The Institute advocates for free-market reforms in healthcare and opposes federal control over the healthcare industry. Heartland supports Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), replacing federal tax deductions for employer-based healthcare with a refundable tax credit to allow individual choice over health insurance, removing state and Federal healthcare regulations aimed at providers and consumers of healthcare, and reducing litigation costs which are associated with malpractice suits. In 2010, Heartland published the 66 page book, The Obamacare Disaster, by Peter Ferrara, which opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2015, the institute filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the petitioner in King v. Burwell, a Supreme Court case challenging income tax subsidies to those who enroll in health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act via the federal as opposed to the state health insurance exchanges. =Hydraulic fracturing= The Institute advocates for hydraulic fracturing (aka \\"fracking\\"), a well- stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by pressurized liquids, publishing essays in support of fracking in various national newspapers. On March 20, 2015, Heartland's science director defended hydraulic fracturing on the Your World With Neil Cavuto program on Fox News. Funding The Institute no longer discloses its funding sources, stating that it had ended its practice of donor transparency after experiencing the organized harassment of its donors. Heartland pdf page 9 According to its brochures, Heartland receives money from approximately 5,000 individuals and organizations, and no single corporate entity donates more than 5% of the operating budget, although the figure for individual donors can be much higher, with a single anonymous donor providing $4.6 million in 2008, and $979,000 in 2011, accounting for 20% of Heartland's overall budget, according to reports of a leaked fundraising plan. Heartland states that it does not accept government funds and does not conduct contract research for special-interest groups. Oil and gas companies have contributed to the Institute, including $736,500 from ExxonMobil between 1998 and 2005. Greenpeace reported that Heartland received almost $800,000 from ExxonMobil. In 2008, ExxonMobil said that it would stop funding to groups skeptical of climate change, including Heartland.Monica Heger, \\"ExxonMobil Cuts Back Its Funding for Climate Skeptics,\\" IEEE Spectrum, July 2008 (Retrieved December 27, 2011)Davies, Kert, \\"Exxon continued to fund climate denial in 2009\\", Greenpeace Blog, July 19, 2010. \\"[D]uring the same period where Exxon bent to the pressure on its campaign of denial and cut all funding to hard core deniers like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heartland Institute, the George C. Marshall Institute and others....\\" Retrieved December 27, 2011. Joseph Bast, president of the Institute, argued that ExxonMobil was simply distancing itself from Heartland out of concern for its public image. The Institute has also received funding and support from tobacco companies Philip Morris, Altria and Reynolds American, and pharmaceutical industry firms GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Eli Lilly. State Farm Insurance, USAA and Diageo are former supporters.The Battle Over Climate Science PopSci June 21, 2012 The Independent reported that Heartland's receipt of donations from Exxon and Philip Morris indicates a \\"direct link...between anti-global warming sceptics funded by the oil industry and the opponents of the scientific evidence showing that passive smoking can damage people's health.\\" The Institute opposes legislation on passive smoking as infringing on personal liberty and the rights of owners of bars and other establishments. As of 2006, the Walton Family Foundation had contributed approximately $300,000 to Heartland. The Institute published an op-ed in the Louisville Courier-Journal defending Wal- Mart against criticism over its treatment of workers. The Walton Family Foundation donations were not disclosed in the op-ed, and the editor of the Courier-Journal stated that he was unaware of the connection and would probably not have published the op-ed had he known of it. The St. Petersburg Times described the Institute as \\"particularly energetic defending Wal-Mart.\\" Heartland has stated that its authors were not \\"paid to defend Wal-Mart\\" and did not receive funding from the corporation; it did not disclose the approximately $300,000 received from the Walton Family Foundation. In 2010, MediaTransparency said that Heartland received funding from politically conservative foundations such as the Castle Rock Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the John M. Olin Foundation, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Between 2002 and 2010, Donors Trust, a nonprofit donor-advised fund, granted $13.5 million to the Institute. In 2011, the Institute received $25,000 from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. The Charles Koch Foundation states that the contribution was \\"$25,000 to the Heartland Institute in 2011 for research in healthcare, not climate change, and this was the first and only donation the Foundation made to the institute in more than a decade\\". In 2012, a large number of sponsors withdrew funding due to the 2012 documents incident and the controversy over their billboard campaign. The Institute lost an estimated $825,000, or one third of planned corporate fundraising for the year. According to the organization's audited financial statements for 2014 and 2015 approximately 27% and 19% of revenues, respectively, came from a single unidentified donor.  2012 documents incident  On February 14, 2012, the global warming blog DeSmogBlog published more than one hundred pages of Heartland documents said to be from the Institute. Heartland acknowledged that some internal documents had been stolen, but said that one, the \\"Climate Strategy memo\\", was forged to discredit Heartland. The documents were initially anonymously sourced, but later found to have been obtained by climate scientist Peter Gleick. The documents included a fundraising plan, board of directors meeting minutes, and the organization's 2012 budget. The documents were analyzed by major media, including The New York Times, The Guardian, United Press International and the Associated Press. Donors to the Institute included the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, Microsoft, General Motors, Comcast, Reynolds American, Philip Morris, Amgen, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Eli Lilly, liquor companies, and an anonymous donor who had given $13 million over the past five years. The documents contained details of payments to support climate change deniers and their programs, namely the founder of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change Craig Idso ($11,600 per month), physicist Fred Singer ($5,000 plus expenses per month), geologist Robert M. Carter ($1,667 per month) and $90,000 to blogger and former meteorologist Anthony Watts. The documents also revealed the Institute's plan to develop curriculum materials to be provided to teachers in the United States to promote climate skepticism, plans confirmed by the Associated Press. The documents also disclosed Heartland's $612,000 plan to support Wisconsin Act 10 and to influence the Wisconsin's recall elections called \\"Operation Angry Badger.\\" Carter and Watts confirmed receiving payments. Several environmental organizations called on General Motors and Microsoft to sever their ties with Heartland. Climate scientists called on Heartland to \\"recognise how its attacks on science and scientists have poisoned the debate about climate change policy.\\" Gleick described his actions in obtaining the documents as \\"a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics\\" and said that he \\"deeply regret[ted his] own actions in this case\\". He stated that \\"My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts‚Äîoften anonymous, well- funded, and coordinated‚Äîto attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved.\\"\\"Activist Says He Lied to Obtain Climate Papers\\", The New York Times, published February 20, 2012. On February 24 he wrote to the board of the Pacific Institute requesting a \\"temporary short-term leave of absence\\" from the Institute.\\"Peter Gleick requests short-term leave of absence from Oakland's Pacific Institute\\", San Jose Mercury News, Feb 24, 2012 The Board of Directors stated it was \\"deeply concerned regarding recent events\\" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents, and appointed a new Acting Executive Director on February 27.Pacific Institute Board of Directors statement, Feb 27, 2012. The Board Statement posted on Feb 22, 2012 stated it was \\"deeply concerned and is actively reviewing information about the recent events\\" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents. It was subsequently replaced by the Feb 27, 2012 statement. Gleick was later reinstated to the Pacific Institute after an investigation found Gleick did not forge any documents, and he apologized for using deception to get the documents.

The game and its supporting computer platforms were only released in Japan. The Death Trap is the first game developed by Square, created before they were even an independent company. At the time, Square was a software branch of Den-Yu-Sha, a Japanese power line manufacturing firm; it was not until 1986 that Square Co., Ltd. was independently established. Square followed up with a sequel to The Death Trap in 1985 called Will: The Death Trap II. Square's third and final text adventure game was called Alpha, released in 1986, and tells a science fiction story in the same style as The Death Trap. Gameplay The Death Trap is a silent (no sound) text parser adventure game, which relies on simple command lines from the user's input to progress through the game. As opposed to most \\"text adventures\\", with only text as output, The Death Trap provides graphical feedback using full screen still images. Plot The game's plot revolves around a spy in an African country during a civil war. The story also involves biological warfare. The game's plot is set during the 1980s. In the game, the Cold War has become tense, and many countries have begun to prepare for a global-scale war, working on new weapons. One of such countries is the mysterious \\"B country\\" in Eastern Africa, which in an attempt to create biological weapons kidnaps the famous scientist Dr. Gitanes. An agent named Benson is sent to B country in order to rescue the doctor and avert the new threat to world peace. Development The Death Trap was the first game developed by Square, a computer game software branch of Den-Y≈´-Sha Electric Company. Masashi Miyamoto, who founded Square in September 1983, believed that it would be more efficient to have graphic designers, programmers and writers work together on common projects. Upon Square's inception, Miyamoto initially hired as their first developers university students Hironobu Sakaguchi and Hiromichi Tanaka, and a few others. They shortly began work on Square's first game, The Death Trap. Sakaguchi noted in 1985 that he had expected to only do clerical work, not develop video games, yet was appointed a producer for the game. Sakaguchi was also a scenario writer for The Death Trap even though he too was a part time employee who had just left university. Harunobu Kato and Tanaka served as programmers. Other scenario writers were Èõ™„ÉéÊµ¶ÁæéÊ®π, ÊûóÊòéÂºò and Èà¥Êú®Â∞öÂøó. The graphics team consisted of Hiromi Nakada, Èõ™„ÉéÊµ¶ÁæéÊ®π, ‰ªäÊ≥âÁæé‰øù and ÊñâËó§Êô∫Â≠ê. Lastly, ‰∫ïÂá∫Â∫∑‰ª£ held the position of data editing. During the creation of The Death Trap all of Squares‚Äô staff were part time. Halfway through development, Sakaguchi reached out to a part time cassette rental store employee named Nobuo Uematsu that Sakaguchi had previously met and received a demo tape from. The game was published in Japan for the NEC PC-8801 in October 1984. It was later released for the Fujitsu FM-7 in December 1984. The game was the first game released in Japan that allowed both Japanese and English text entry during gameplay, as all previous Japanese games were done in English to be like games released on the Apple II. During this period, The Death Trap was one of three games that made within two years, which was a fast pace of development. There were two editions of the game with two different cover arts, the first of which is now super rare. The game was unique among titles of the time for introducing full- screen images. Reception The Death Trap received little attention at the time of release, though it was successful enough for Square to immediately go on to create a sequel: Will: The Death Trap II. Hironobu Sakaguchi, Hiromichi Tanaka, Harunobu Kato and Hiromi Nakada continued developing games for Square, while the rest of those credited left. Retrospective examination from PC Gamer called the game's art ‚Äúrudimentary‚Äù. USGamer described the plot as a Cold War era spy thriller. Project EGG, a licensed emulator for home computer games, included The Death Trap, Will, and Alpha together in its limited edition \\"Classic PC-Game Collection\\" on September 8, 2013, alongside Cruise Chaser Blassty and Genesis‚Äîother Square games released between 1984 and 1987. Sequel is a video game developed and published by Square for the NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, Fujitsu FM-7, and Sharp X1 in 1985. The game and its supporting computer platforms were released exclusively in Japan. Will is the sequel to The Death Trap, and was Square's second release. Sakaguchi once again wrote the game's scenario, and has explained that he used The Death Trap as the basis of the game and ‚Äúbeefed up the story, the universe, and the game system‚Äù for the sequel. Much like its predecessor, Will is an interactive fiction game, which relies on simple command lines from the user's input to progress through the game. As opposed to the earlier \\"text adventures\\", with only text as output, Will provides graphical feedback by using pictures. Square recruited a postgraduate student from Keio University to program the bitmap graphics of Will. The game is considered one of the first animated computer games. Will sold 100,000 copies in Japan, which, while less than its predecessor, was a major commercial success at the time of its release. The game is also considered Squares‚Äô first hit.

Biography Pierre Henry was born in Paris, French Third Republic (; ), and began experimenting at the age of 15 with sounds produced by various objects. He became fascinated with the integration of noise into music. He studied with Nadia Boulanger, Olivier Messiaen, and F√©lix Passerone at the Paris Conservatoire from 1938 to 1948 . Between 1949 and 1958, Henry worked at the Club d'Essai studio at RTF, which had been founded by Pierre Schaeffer in 1943 . During this period, he wrote the 1950 piece Symphonie pour un homme seul, in cooperation with Schaeffer; he also composed the first musique concr√®te to appear in a commercial film, the 1952 short film Astrologie ou le miroir de la vie. Henry scored numerous additional films and ballets. Two years after leaving the RTF, he founded with Jean Baronnet the first private electronic studio in France, the Apsone-Cabasse Studio . Among Henry's works is the 1967 ballet Messe pour le temps pr√©sent , a collaboration with choreographer Maurice B√©jart that debuted in Avignon (, ). In 1970 Henry collaborated with British rock band Spooky Tooth on the album Ceremony . Composer Christopher Tyng was heavily inspired by Henry's \\"Psych√© Rock\\" when writing the theme to the popular animated cartoon show Futurama. The theme is so reminiscent of Henry's song, it is considered a variation of the original . Henry died on Wednesday 5 July 2017 at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Paris, at the age of 89 (; ; ; ).

It is notable for its research and rehabilitation efforts concerning wildlife affected by oil spills, which have been international in scope. History Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research was established in the winter of 1976 after the Liberian oil tanker Olympic Games ran aground in the Delaware River. The original focus of the organization concerned the study, treatment, and development of methods to remove oil from wildfowl in the case of a future oil spill. In 1982, the organization established a full-time Wild Bird Clinic in order to care for and rehabilitate injured or orphaned wild birds and fledglings. This operation grew rapidly and moved into a newly built facility in 1989. The first Effects of Oil on Wildlife Conference (EOW) was established and hosted by Tri-State Bird Rescue in 1982. The purpose of this conference was to bring together wildlife experts from a variety of disciplines in order to address the issue of wildlife affected by oil spills. A second EOW conference was held in Washington, DC in 1990. The conference has continued to meet every 2‚Äì3 years since then, most recently in Baltimore, Maryland in 2018. In 1991, members of the Tri-State Oil Spill Response Team traveled to the Middle East, sponsored by UNESCO, in order to assist with response efforts related to the intentional destruction of oil fields and transport ships during the Gulf War. In 2001, the organization was invited by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help draft the \\"Best Practices for Migratory Bird Care During Oil Spill Response\\" document, to serve as a guide for personnel seeking to provide care for affected birds during an oil-spill containment effort. Tri-State oil-spill staff have been involved in incidents near Spain, France, South Africa, the Galapagos Islands, as well as many domestic incidents across the United States. Tri-State was the lead wildlife rehabilitation response organization during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Activities Tri-State oil-spill response staff train volunteers, engage in rehabilitation efforts, and work in concert with other organizations and agencies in order to develop responses to oil-spills. Tri-State staff and affiliates also conduct research regarding methods by which affected wildlife may be rehabilitated. Tri-State staff also cooperate with interns and researchers from universities and institutions in order to conduct bird- related research not directly applicable to oil-spill situations. The organization has assisted the USGS with a study concerning the effects of lead and pesticide exposure on fish-eating birds, as well as surveys of the prevalence of West Nile virus among birds in the region. The organization's Wild Bird Clinic is one of the largest of its type in the United States, and handles the rehabilitation of birds from the region (and also from elsewhere within the United States), with the aim of eventual release to the wild. The facility operates under federal and multiple state permits, and is staffed by both veterinary staff and volunteers. This clinic handles more than two thousand birds annually. It is currently housed within the Frink Center for Wildlife. In addition to oil-spill response and bird rehabilitation, the staff and organization also publish papers and journals, and provide workshops and training for affiliate and local personnel from other organizations and agencies elsewhere.

The railway was recognized as the fastest interurban line in 1925 and 1926., Texas State Historical Association. Route Houston station and car from the Galveston-Houston Interurban Railroad (postcard, circa 1915) The Interurban ran the 50 miles (80 km) from downtown Houston to downtown Galveston in as little as 75 minutes. The track roughly followed the current path of Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway), and is now used as a utility right of way for high tension power lines. The Galveston Bay causeway was considered a great feat of engineering and cost about US$2 million (US$ in present-day terms) to build in the late 1910s. While most of the original stations have been demolished to make room for new structures, several artifacts remain. Minute Maid Park was built from Union Station, and features a railway theme. Before Interstate 45, a small, two- story interurban station was located on College Avenue where it crossed Airport Boulevard. This crossing was not at right angles but like an \\"X\\" and would be located slightly east of I-45 on the feeder street, if it still existed today. Airport Blvd becomes College Ave in South Houston at I-45. The original causeway in Galveston can be easily seen to the east from the interstate highway causeway. Other stops included Park Place, City of South Houston (formerly City of Dumont), College Ave/Airport Blvd at Interstate 45, Clear Creek Crossing (the power station), and the Galveston Terminal on 21st Street, between Church and Post Office streets. Future There has been recent talk of re-establishing some form of train service between Houston and Galveston. Several test trips have been made using Amtrak equipment under the Gulfliner name. It has been suggested that some parts of the old Interurban right of way might be used to bypass congested sections of track on the host railroad.

It was designed as a simple and quick-to-build \\"emergency fighter\\" alternative to the Royal Air Force's Spitfires and Hurricanes should their production become disrupted by bombing expected in the anticipated German invasion of England. Due to the subsequent shifting of the German bombing effort after the Battle of Britain towards British cities in what became known as The Blitz, together with the dispersal of British fighter manufacturing, the Luftwaffe's bombing of the original Spitfire and Hurricane factories did not seriously affect production, and so the M.20 proved unnecessary and the design was not pursued. Design and development At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Miles Aircraft began work on a single-engined fighter to supplement the RAF's Spitfires and Hurricanes. A wooden mock-up of the design, the M20/1, was inspected by Sir Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, but no orders followed. Following the outbreak of the Battle of Britain in July 1940, the Royal Air Force was faced with a potential shortage of fighters. To meet the Luftwaffe threat, the Air Ministry commissioned Miles to design a simple easy-to-build fighter to specification F.19/40. This became the Miles M.20/2. Nine weeks and two days later the first prototype flew.Bridgeman 1946, p. 133.Brown Aeroplane Monthly April 1976, pp. 207‚Äì208. To reduce production time the M.20 employed all-wood construction and used many parts from the earlier Miles Master trainer, lacked hydraulics, and had spatted fixed landing gear. The fixed undercarriage freed space and payload sufficient for twelve .303 Browning machine guns and 5000 rounds, and 154 Imperial gallons (700 litres) of fuel (double the range and ammunition capacity of the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire). The M.20 was fitted with a bubble canopy for improved 360-degree vision. In line with a design philosophy emphasising simplicity, speed and re-using available components, the engine was a Rolls-Royce Merlin XX \\"power egg\\" identical to those used on Merlin-powered Avro Lancasters and Bristol Beaufighters. This conferred flight performance that fell between those of Britain's two frontline fighters. Testing and evaluation thumb The first prototype, with the B-class serial U-9 first flew on 15 September 1940,Jarrett 1992, p.55. and was tested at the A & AEE under the military serial number AX834 against Specification F.19/40. Armed with eight .303 Browning machine guns like the Hurricane, the M.20 prototype was faster than the Hurricane but slower than Spitfire types then in production, but carried more ammunition and had greater range than either. As the Luftwaffe had been defeated over Britain, the need for the M.20 had vanished and the design was abandoned without entering production. The first prototype was scrapped at Woodley. A second prototype, U-0228 (later DR616) was built to Specification N.1/41 for a Fleet Air Arm shipboard fighter, equipped with an arrestor hook and catapult launch points. It first flew on 8 April 1941.Jarrett 1992, p. 57. This variant could be launched by catapult aircraft merchant ships which lacked flight decks so the aircraft were to be ditched after their mission, and to facilitate this the undercarriage could be jettisoned. However, obsolete Hurricanes were modified to fill this role, which rendered a shipboard variant of the M.20 unnecessary. Consequently, this prototype was also scrapped.

Polarium Advance was developed by Mitchell Corporation for the Game Boy Advance. The object of the game is similar to that of Polarium. Black and white tiles fill a grid, and by drawing a single line in the grid, tiles can be flipped from black to white (or vice versa). Solid, horizontal lines of all black or all white tiles are erased, and the goal is to erase the entire grid in this manner. The game received a re-release on Wii U Virtual Console in late-2015/early-2016. The game was planned to be released in China for the iQue Game Boy Advance system, but this release was cancelled due to high piracy. However, the Chinese translation was fully completed, and it can be played through emulation. However, the game's DS predecessor was released in China. Game modes *Stage **Daily Polarium: This mode consists of 365 puzzles - one puzzle for each day in a year - and your goal is to solve one puzzle per day. **Polarium Reference: Here you can play groups of puzzles you have already cleared in Daily Polarium. **Edit and Custom: In these modes you can create and play, respectively, your own puzzles (up to 100). Initially, the only Special Tiles that can be used in your own puzzles are Hurdle tiles, but the other Special tiles can be unlocked during the regular game. You can also input puzzles by password, and the game is backwards compatible with passwords for Polarium. *Time Attack: In this mode, you're given either 5 hard or 10 easy randomly generated puzzles, and have to solve them as fast as possible. Unlike its predecessor, Polarium Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance, with some significant changes. The unpopular Challenge Mode was removed, and the game focuses more on the Puzzle Mode, which features 365 puzzles - nearly four times as many as Polarium. Each puzzle stage can be played in Stage Mode, with no time limit, or Time Mode, where the player aims to complete a puzzle as fast as possible. Edit Mode for creating custom puzzles makes a return in Polarium Advance as well. The color scheme is changeable from black and white, to add a bit of customization and color to the game. How to play As in the predecessor, the goal is to select tiles by drawing a line over them with one, continuous stroke. Polarium Advance uses the D-pad for controlling where Polarium used the DS stylus, and the A button (or L, for playing single- handed) for starting or ending a stroke. Selected tiles will flip from black to white or vice versa, and the puzzle is completed if each horizontal line consists of a single color afterwards. Surrounding the main puzzle area are gray \\"neutral\\" tiles that have no effect on the puzzle but can be used to flip disconnected groups of tiles in a single pass. =Special Tiles= In order to add some variety to the gameplay, three new tiles have been added in addition to the standard black and white ones. Solid tiles cause all tiles above them to fall when erased, Hurdle tiles cannot have lines drawn over them, and Multi-tiles are \\"wild cards\\" in that they function as white or black panels. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one eight for a total of 29 out of 40.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the seventh by Ruth Plumly Thompson. Like nineteen of the twenty previous books, it was illustrated by John R. Neill. Plot Patch is the country of the Quilties, a land of seamstresses and quiltmakers; it lies in the Quadling quadrant of Oz. Its people have a serious problem. Their queen, Cross Patch the Sixth, has gone to pieces--literally; small pieces too. To find her successor, the land's Chief Scrapper and Prime Piercer unwind the Spool of Succession, and follow where the golden thread leads. It leads, in this instance, to the Emerald City, where it selects Scraps, the Patchwork Girl of Oz (first introduced in her eponymously titled novel, the seventh Oz book by L. Frank Baum) to be the new queen. The two Quilties, used to resistance from Queens-to-be (it's not that good a job), kidnap Scraps.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 36, 47, 156-7, 165. Meanwhile, Peter Brown, a boy from Philadelphia, is transported by a balloon bird to the Runaway Island, where Ruggedo, the wicked Gnome King has been exiled for five years (see Kabumpo in Oz).Who's Who in Oz, pp. 145, 159. A seaquake reveals the sunken pirate ship of Polacky the Plunderer--which contains the magic chest of Soob the Sorcerer. The chest holds several magic treasures, including a magic cloak that is supposed to render the wearer invisible and teleport him anywhere he chooses. But the cloak is torn and does not work. The ship, however, derelict as it is, allows Peter and Ruggedo to drift to the Land of Ev. Promising to make Peter a general in his army, Ruggedo returns to the Gnome Kingdom and forces the current king, Kaliko, to abdicate in his favor. Ruggedo's plan is to have the cloak mended, then use it to fly to the Emerald City and recover his magic belt, with all its power -- but he learns that the tricky repair job can only be done properly by the expert tailors in Patch. With Peter, he makes his way to Patch, where he offers Peter as a slave in return for the repair of the cloak. The Patch ministers accept this offer and the cloak is repaired. Peter meets Scraps and makes other new friends, including Grumpy the Bear and Ozwold the Ostrich.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 84-5,152. Together they escape from Patch and set out for the Emerald City in order to warn Ozma about Ruggedo's plans. Meanwhile, using the power of the repaired cloak, Ruggedo becomes invisible and teleports to the Emerald City, where he causes some mischief before Peter arrives. Still invisible, Ruggedo steals the magic belt. He is about to use its powers to teleport Ozma and her friends to the bottom of the ocean, but Peter overcomes him by throwing a \\"silence stone\\", one of the treasures he had taken from the sunken pirate ship, at Ruggedo's head, which robs Ruggedo of the power of speech. Since the magic belt only responds to spoken commands, this renders Ruggedo harmless, and the Wizard of Oz makes him visible again. Ozma makes Peter a Prince of Oz, but the boy chooses to return to Philadelphia; he can't let down his team.

A cocktail onion is usually a pearl onion pickled in a brine with small amounts of turmeric and paprika. Pearl onions are naturally sweet, which makes them an excellent pairing with many cocktails. Other sweet onions such as the crystal wax, also known as the white Bermuda, are also sometimes used. In many cases, white varieties of these sweet onions are used, since many consumers expect cocktail onions to be white. However, yellow or red sweet onions may be used as well. In northern California cuisine some haute bars may use sliced red onion pickled in vinegar. Some recipes also call for the onions to be packed in white vermouth as well as vinegar. Generally, the onion retains a slightly crunchy texture through the brining process, which can add a different mouthfeel to the drinking experience. Since the cocktail onion is made from a sweet onion, it is unlikely to upset the digestion with a sulfurous or eye-watering taste, although some cultures use more pungent onions as cocktail garnishes.

It ranges from southernmost Alaska south to central California, mostly in the Pacific Coast Ranges, but with isolated disjunct populations in southeast British Columbia and in north to central Idaho.

Characteristics The Pacific yew is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer, growing tall and with a trunk up to diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple leader form. It has thin scaly brown bark, covering a thin layer of off-white sap wood with a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a magenta/purplish hue to deep red. The leaves are lanceolate, flat, dark green, long and broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious. The seed cones are highly modified, each cone containing a single seed long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril, long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6‚Äì9 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by thrushes and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2‚Äì3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time. Habitat Pacific yew grows in varying types of environments; however, in drier environments it is mostly limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops. Pacific yew is shade tolerant; however it can also grow in sun. The tree's shade tolerance allows it to form an understory, which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature. Varieties Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. Although T. brevifolia is typically a tree as described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally occurs in the mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000 ft (1000‚Äì1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north.Spjut, R. W. 2007. Taxonomy and nomenclature of Taxus. J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas 1(1): 203‚Äì289. It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off to one side of the stem, usually the upper side.Web page, World Botanical Associates, Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_reptaneta.htm. Retrieved 9 Dec 2014 The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means ‚Äúcreeping, prostrate, and rooting,‚ÄùStearn, W. T. 1983. Botanical Latin. 3rd ed. David & Charles, London which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface. Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta has been arbitrarily indicated synonymous with typical yew, T. brevifolia (var. brevifolia); there are no studies to support this view. Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different geographical ranges. For example, T. mairei var. speciosa, which occurs with the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected because ‚Äúthere is no geographic reason‚Äù for recognizing itM√∂ller M, Gao L-M, Mill RR, Liu J, Zhang D-Q, Poudel RC, Li D-Z, 2013.

High variation and strong phylogeographic pattern among cpDNA haplotypes in Taxus wallichiana (Taxaceae) in China and North Vietnam. Molec. Ecol. 16: 4684‚Äì4698. Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta has also been proposed to be elevated to subspecies status without justification or explanation. Such a change would likely cause considerable confusion in view of the subspecies rank having already been used in the genus Taxus for defining geographically separated subspecies of a single species (T. baccata).Pilger R, 1903. Taxaceae-Taxoideae‚ÄîTaxeae. Taxus. In: Das Pflanzenreich IV (Engler A. ed.): 110‚Äì116. Further, it has been recommended that taxonomists be strongly discouraged from ‚Äúelevating a ‚Äòvariety‚Äô to a ‚Äòsubspecies‚Äô unless there is sufficient scientific evidence to warrant such an elevation,‚Äù and that ‚Äúit is crucial to provide continuity.‚ÄùEllison AM, Davis CC, Calie PJ, Naczi RFC, 2014.

Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta. Typical Taxus brevifolia, like most species in the genus, usually produces a single ovule on a complex scaly shoot, composed of a primary shoot and a secondary short shoot. To the casual observer they appear as one funnelform shoot with an ovule at the apex.Florin R, 1951. Evolution in cordaites and conifers. Acta Horti Berg. 16: 285‚Äì388, plate However, Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta differs from var. brevifolia in producing a relatively longer primary shoot with as many five secondary shoots.Web page, World Botanical Associates, Overview of the genus Taxus, http://www.worldbotanical.com/TAXNA.HTM, retrieved 9 Dec 2014 The epithet, polychaeta, is in reference to the primary shoot resembling a polychaete worm; hence, its common name 'worm cone yew'. Variety polychaeta appears to be relatively rare. It may have been extirpated from the type locality‚Äîaround Mud Bay near Olympia, Washington‚Äîas a result of urban expansion. It is also known from northern Idaho and Sonoma County, California.Web page, World Botanical Associates, Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_polychaeta.htm; retrieved 9 Dec 2014 As in the case with thicket yew, worm yew has been indicated to be the same as the typical variety, but again there are no specific studies to support this conclusion. The authority of thicket yew and worm cone yew has been involved in the study of the genus Taxus for 25 years at the time the varieties were described.Spjut, R. W. 1977.

The Japanese have also used the wood for decorative purposes. Members of the Pit River Tribe would sell this plant to the Ukiah.Chestnut, V.

Birds eat such cups and spread the seeds. =Discovery of taxol= The chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (taxol), used in breast, ovarian, and lung cancer treatment, can be derived from Taxus brevifolia and other species of yew. As it was already becoming scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized, the Pacific yew was never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; the widespread use of the paclitaxel (taxol) was enabled when a semi-synthetic pathway was developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species. Unlicensed pharmaceutical production use of closely related wild yew species in India and China may be threatening some of those species.

Property is transferred by a person (called a trustor, settlor, or grantor) to a transferee (called the trustee), who holds the property for the benefit of one or more persons, called beneficiaries. The trustee may distribute the property, or the income from that property, to the beneficiaries. Express trusts are frequently used in common law jurisdictions as methods of wealth preservation or enhancement. Terms Law generally requires only a simple formality to create an express trust. In certain jurisdictions, an express trust may even be established orally. Typically, a settlor would record the disposition, where real property is to be held in trust or the value of property in trust is large. Where legal title to property is being passed to a trustee, a \\"deed of settlement\\" or \\"Trust Instrument\\" (for jurisdictions that do not recognise Deeds) may be used. Where property is to continue to be held by the person making the trust, a \\"declaration of trust\\" will be appropriate. Often, a trust corporation or more than one trustee is appointed to allow for uninterrupted administration of the trust in the event of a trustee's resignation, death, bankruptcy or incapacity. Additionally a Protector may be appointed who, for example, is authorized to appoint new trustees and to review the trustees' annual accounts. To be valid at common law, a trust instrument must ascertain its beneficiaries, as well as the res (a Latin term meaning \\"thing\\") or subject matter of the trust, unless it is a charitable trust which does not provide specific beneficiaries. To be valid in equity, a trust must satisfy the following elements: 1\\\\. Property or rights of a kind which can be the subject of a trust 2\\\\. A declaration of trust or disposition on trust by a person legally competent to create a trust 3\\\\. Certainty of property and objects (trust must be administratively workable 4\\\\. Compliance with requirements regarding evidence 5\\\\. Compliance with rule against remoteness of vesting (rule against perpetuities and rule against inalienability of income for longer than the perpetuity period) Common forms of express trust ; Bare trust: property transferred to another to hold e.g. for a third person absolutely. May be of use where property is to be held and invested on behalf of a minor child or mentally incapacitated person. ; Life Interest trust: the income from property transferred is paid to one person, \\"the life tenant\\" (e.g. a widow/er), during their lifetime and thereafter is transferred to another person (who may take absolutely or a second life interest according to the terms of the trust, in the second case a third beneficiary would come into play). The trustees may have power to pay capital as well as income to the life tenant. Alternatively, they may have rights to transfer (\\"appoint\\") property to other beneficiaries ahead of their entitlement. ; Discretionary trust: the trustees may pay out income to whichever of the beneficiaries they, in the reasonable exercise of their discretion, think fit. They will normally also have a power to pay out capital. They may have extensive powers, even to add new beneficiaries, but such powers may normally only be exercised bona fide in the interests of the beneficiaries as a whole... Discretionary trusts must not be indefinite and are subject to 'the rule against perpetuities'. In New South Wales, the time prescribed is a statutory period of 80 years from the date the disposition takes effect.(1). ; Charitable trusts: this is also a form of discretionary trust; trusts for a purpose (as opposed to for individuals) are generally invalid at common law however charities are an exception. Persons wishing to pass money to causes not recognised as charitable may instead make gifts to established companies or associations or may establish trusts or trust-like structures in jurisdictions which do not restrict non-charitable purpose trusts (e.g. Jersey trusts, Danish and US foundations and Liechtenstein Anstallts). ; Protective trusts and Spendthrift trusts: can be established to provide an income for persons who cannot be trusted with it. Three Certainties of Express Trust * Certainty of intention: Must be real intention by the settlor to dispose of property and create trust, not just make a gift ‚Äì a trust also can't be created contrary to the intention of the settlor alleged to have created it: Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Jolliffe.. * Certainty of subject:The property the subject of the trusts must be sufficiently ascertainable at the time the trust was created: Herdegen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) * Certainty of object:Beneficiaries must be ascertainable ‚Äì ; Fixed trust ‚Äì ‚ÄòList certainty rule‚Äô (Test): see e.g. West v Weston (1998) . ; Discretionary trust -'criterion certainty test‚Äô :is whether it can be said that a given individual is or is not a member of the range of objects (class): Re Baden‚Äôs Deed Trusts; McPhail v Doulton Variation of Trusts in English Law The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 gave the courts the power to vary trusts in the following circumstances * s1(1)(a) Any person having, directly or indirectly, an interest, whether vested or contingent, under the trusts who by reason of infancy or other incapacity is incapable of assenting; or * s1(1)(b) Any person (whether ascertained or not) who may become entitled, directly or indirectly, to an interest under the trusts as being at a future date or on the happening of a future event a person of any specified description or a member of any specified class of persons, so however that this paragraph shall not include any person who would be of that description, or a member of that class, as the case may be, if the said date had fallen or the said event had happened at the date of the application to the court; or * s1(1)(c) Any person unborn; or * s1(1)(d) Any person in respect of any discretionary interest of his under protective trusts where the interest of the principal beneficiary has not failed or determined. The court does not have the power to consent to the variation of a trust on behalf of an ascertained individual who is sui juris.(Someone above the age of consent and of sound mind) Forms of trust used by UK taxpayers ; Accumulation and Maintenance trust: A variation on the discretionary trust, the A&M; does not carry the Inheritance tax disadvantages of a discretionary settlement but can only be established for persons under 25 who must be entitled to income at that age. Allows the accumulation of income within the trust until 25. ; Disabled Trust: Similar to an A&M; trust but established for a disabled person. ; Reverter to Settlor trust: A trust where, on the death of the life tenant, the property reverts to the person making the gift. ; Nil Rate Band Discretionary trust: UK inheritance tax is payable at 40% on estates worth over ¬£325,000 for the 2009-2010 tax year. If assets up to that value are placed in a discretionary trust during a person's lifetime, the trust will not be taken into account for inheritance tax if the person survives for a further 7 years. Likewise in a will, many persons leave a legacy on discretionary trusts so as to take full advantage of their nil rate band (gifts to spouses and registered civil partners being wholly exempt). Forms of trust used by US persons Certain US jurisdictions and other jurisdictions have developed a radically different interpretation of the trust. Valid trusts can be established by persons who then continue to deal with property as if it were their own during their lifetime, the trust crystallising on death. Trust funds can be taxed as legal entities by election (\\"checking the box\\").

Born in the Chaharmardan neighbourhood of Qom, Iran, he underwent both seminary and secular studies in Iran. He belongs to the Sadr family from Jabal Amel in Lebanon, a branch of the Musawi family tracing to Musa Ibn Jaafar, the seventh Shia Imam and ultimately to the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima. Therefore, Musa al-Sadr is often styled with the honorific title Sayyid. He left Qom for Najaf to study theology and returned to Iran after the 1958 Iraqi coup d'√©tat. Some years later, Sadr went to Tyre, Lebanon as the emissary of Ayatollahs Borujerdi and Hakim. Fouad Ajami called him a \\"towering figure in modern Shi'i political thought and praxis\\"., chapter 26 He gave the Shia population of Lebanon \\"a sense of community\\". In Lebanon, he founded and revived many organizations including schools, charities, and the Amal Movement. On 25 August 1978, Sadr and two companions departed for Libya to meet with government officials at the invitation of Muammar Gaddafi. The three were last seen on 31 August. They were never heard from again. Many theories exist around the circumstances of Sadr's disappearance, none of which have been proven. His whereabouts remain unknown to this day. Early life and education =Family background= Musa al-Sadr came from a long line of clerics tracing their ancestry back to Jabal Amel. His great-great-grandfather S. Salih b. Muhammad Sharafeddin, a high-ranking cleric, was born in Shhour, a village near Tyre, Lebanon. Following a frantic turn of events related to an anti-Ottoman uprising, he left for Najaf. Sharafeddin's son, Sadreddin, left Najaf for Isfahan, which was then the most important centre of religious learning in Iran. He returned to Najaf shortly before his death in 1847. The youngest of his five sons, Ismail (as-Sadr), was born in Isfahan, in Qajar- ruled Iran, and eventually became a leading mujtahid. The second son of Ismail, also named Sadreddin, was born in Ottoman Iraq and also decided to settle permanently in Iran. He became Musa al-Sadr's father. While living in Iran, Sadreddin married a daughter of Ayatollah Hussein Tabatabaei Qomi, an Iranian religious leader. She would become Musa al-Sadr's mother. =Early life= Musa al-Sadr was born in the Cheharmardan neighborhood of Qom, Iran, on 4 June 1928. ªAlƒ´ RƒÅhnamƒÅ. Pioneers of Islamic Revival Palgrave Macmillan, 1994 p 195 He attended Hayat Elementary School in Qom where he attended seminary classes informally; he started his official seminary education in 1941. His teachers considered him a \\"quick learner and remarkably knowledgeable for his young age\\". After a while he started teaching other students \\"lower-level\\" courses. This coincided with the \\"liberalizing of Iranian politics\\", the political climate of his time was secular, so that most religious scholars \\"felt politically and socially marginalized\\". To have some influence in the \\"national life\\" he concluded that he had to become familiar with \\"modern science and contemporary world\\". As a result, he started a \\"full secular education\\" alongside his seminary studies. He moved to Tehran, where he completed a degree in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and political sciences from Tehran University and learned some English and French. He then returned to Qom to study theology and Islamic philosophy under Allamah Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai. In Iraq Following the death of his father in 1953, he left Qom for Najaf to study theology under Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim and Abul Qasim Khui. There he had teachers such as: Ayatollah Hakim, Shaykh Morteza al Yasin, Ayatollah Abulqasim Khu'i, Shaykh Hossein Hilli, Shaykh Sadra Badkubahi, and others, some of whom became Marja after Ayatollah Borujerdi's death. Musa al- Sadr became a mujtahid in Najaf. In 1955 he traveled to Lebanon where he met Abd al-Hossein Sharafeddin. He had met him previously in 1936 when his family had hosted Abd al-Husayn in Iran. The same year he left Iran and returned to Najaf and, in the autumn of 1956, he married the daughter of Ayatollah Azizollah Khalili. Return to Iran After the 1958 Iraqi coup d'√©tat and the overthrow of the monarchy in Iraq, Sadr returned to Iran. There, he accepted the request of Ali Davani, who was sent by Ayatollah Shariatmadari, and became an editor of Darsha'i az maktab-e Eslam, also known as Maktab-e Eslam, a journal published by the Hawza of Qom and endorsed by Ayatollah Broujerdi. He began contributing with the third issue, focusing on Islamic economics, \\"a novel subject at the time\\". His articles in this field were then published as a book. He soon became the journal's \\"de facto editor-in-chief\\". He left the journal in December 1959 along with some of its original founders. Musa Sadr also took part in devising a new scheme for Hawza called \\"Tarh-e Moqddamati-ye eslah-e howzeh\\", which was then withdrawn, in cooperation with Mohammad Beheshti. In 1959, Sadr founded a private high school which provided an alternative to the state educational system for \\"observant parents\\". Departure to Lebanon Musa Sadr with Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1960s Musa al-Sadr declined Ayatollah Broujerdi's request to go to Italy as his representative and instead left Qom for Najaf. There Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim urged him to accept an invitation to become the leading Shi'a figure in Tyre, succeeding Abdul Hussein Sharif Al Din, who had died in 1957. He left Najaf for Tyre in late 1959, as the \\"emissary\\" of Ayatollah Broujerdi and Ayatollah Hakim. At the request of some clerics, he later made several trips to Iran delivering several lectures such as \\"Islam is a Religion of Life\\" and \\"The World is Ready to Accept the Call of Islam.\\" The latter included presenting his experiences in Lebanon and emphasizing the need to work \\"towards the betterment of Muslims.\\" In 1967, Imam al-Sadr traveled to West Africa to get acquainted with the Lebanese community and inspect its affairs and worked to link them to their homeland. He also met with Ivorian President F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny and Senegalese President L√©opold S√©dar Senghor and provided symbolic assistance to orphans in Senegal. Senghor praised the Imam's gesture, pointing out that he is following his activities with great interest, which had a great influence in spreading the feeling of love and faith among the citizens. Sadr, who became known as Imam Musa, quickly became one of the most prominent advocates for the Shia population of Lebanon, a group that was both economically and politically disadvantaged. \\"[Sadr] worked tirelessly to improve the lot of his community ‚Äì to give them a voice, to protect them from the ravages of war and inter communal strife,\\" said Vali Nasr. Sadr impressed the Lebanese people \\"by providing practical assistance,\\" regardless of their sect. He was seen as a moderate, demanding that the Maronite Christians relinquish some of their power, but pursuing ecumenism and peaceful relations between the groups. In 1969, Imam Musa was appointed the first head of the Supreme Islamic Shia Council (SISC) in Lebanon, () an entity meant to give the Shia more say in government. For the next four years, Sadr engaged the leadership of Syrian ‚ÄòAlawƒ´s in an attempt to unify their political power with that of the Twelver Shia. Although controversial, recognition of the ‚ÄòAlawƒ´ as Shi'a coreligionists came in July 1973 when he and the ‚ÄòAlawƒ´ religious leadership successfully appointed an ‚ÄòAlawƒ´ as an official mufti to the Twelver community. Three-day hunger strike by Musa Sadr in Safa mosque in Beirut in protest at Lebanese Civil War He revived the Jami'at al-Birr wal- Ihsan charity, founded by S. Salih b. Muhammad Sharafeddin and gathered money for The Social Institute (al-Mu'assasa al-Ijtima'iyya), an orphanage in Tyre. In 1963, Sadr established a sewing school and nursery named The Girls' Home (Bayt al-Fatat). The same year, he established The Institute of Islamic Studies (Ma'had al-Dirasat al-Islamiyya). In 1964, Sadr started Burj al- Shimali Technical Institute, whose funding was provided by Shi'a benefactors, bank loans, and the Lebanese Ministry of Education. In 1974, he founded, with Hussein el-Husseini, the Movement of the Disinherited () to press for better economic and social conditions for the Shia. They established a number of schools and medical clinics throughout southern Lebanon, many of which are still in operation today. Sadr attempted to prevent the descent into violence that eventually led to the Lebanese Civil War by beginning a fast in a mosque in Beirut. There he was visited by Lebanese from all factions ‚Äì both Muslim and Christian. Yasser Arafat and Syrian Foreign Minister Abd al-Halim Khaddam, also visited him. Formation of a national unity cabinet resulted from the meeting and Sadr's attempt to establish peace was a temporary success. During the war, he aligned himself with the Lebanese National Movement and Movement of the Disinherited and in cooperation with Mostafa Chamran developed an armed wing known as AfwƒÅj al-MuqƒÅwamat al-LubnƒÅniyyah (), better known as Amal ( meaning \\"hope\\"), which assembled youth and educated generation of Husaynis and Mousawis families. Shia were the only major community without a militia group in the land of militias; Amal was created by Sadr to protect Shia rights and interests. However, in 1976, he withdrew his support after the Syrian invasion against Palestinian and leftist militias. He also actively cooperated with Mostafa Chamran, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, and other Iranian Islamist activists during the civil war. Sadr and Chamran had an important role in the Islamic Revolution of Iran. They were involved in protests against the Shah out of Iran. According to Amal diputy, Ali Kharis, \\"Musa Sadr and Chamran were the backbone of the Iranian revolution and how one can not speak of the Iranian revolution without mentioning these two people.\\" In addition, Sadr was instrumental in developing ties between Hafez Assad, then Syrian president, and the opponents of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran. Personal life Musa al-Sadr maintained strong family relations with political leaders in Iran, Lebanon and Iraq. Musa al-Sadr is related to noted Iranian individuals namely Sadeq Tabatabaei (his nephew), as well as Mohammad Khatami (his wife was a niece of Musa al-Sadr), and Ayatollah Khomeini's son Ahmad Khomeini (his wife was another of Musa al-Sadr's nieces). Sadr's son was married to Khomeini's granddaughter. His sister, Rabab al-Sadr, is a social activist who does charity work, and also a painter trained in Italy who earned a doctorate in philosophy,The journey of Rabab Sadr, president of Imam el Sadr Institutions her paradigm being influenced by S√∏ren Kierkegaard.Habib C.

He supports his claim by referring to a cable sent home by George M. Godley, a U.S. ambassador to Lebanon: \\"He is without debate one of the most, if not the most, impressive individual I have met in Lebanon. . . . His charisma is obvious and his apparent sincerity is awe-inspiring\\". In Lebanon, he had garnered significant popularity \\"due to his good rapport with young people.\\" Standing at ,Sandra Mackey, Mirror of the Arab World: Lebanon in Conflict, W. W. Norton & Company (2008), p. 162 scholar Fouad Ajami describes Sadr's charisma and magnetism as such: > Lebanon has long been a country finicky about the looks, the aura, al haiba > of a leader. The Shia in particular have been noted to be a people of some > vanity. In the Shia tradition, the Imams were not only morally infallible > men (an Imam was said to be masum, not subject to error), but also > physically perfect beings.

The three were last seen on 31 August. They were never heard from again. It is widely believed, at least by Lebanese Shia Muslims, that Gaddafi ordered al-Sadr's killing, but differing motivations exist. Libya has consistently denied responsibility, claiming that Sadr and his companions left Libya for Italy.Norton, Augustus R. Hezbollah A Short Story. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2007. Print. However, supporters of the missing cleric pointed out that al- Sadr's baggage was found in a Tripoli hotel and there was no evidence of his arrival in Rome. Airlines could not confirm that al-Sadr had ever flown to Italy from Libya. Al-Sadr's son claimed that he remains secretly in jail in Libya but did not provide proof.Staff (31 August 2010) \\"Imam Sadr and companions still alive in captivity of Libya, son tells news agency\\" The Daily Star (Lebanon). Sadr's disappearance continues to be a major dispute between Lebanon and Libya. Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri claimed that the Libyan regime, and particularly the Libyan leader, was responsible for the disappearance of Imam Musa al-Sadr, as London-based Asharq Al-Awsat, a Saudi- run pan-Arab daily, reported on 27 August 2006.ÿ®ÿ±Ÿä Ÿäÿ≠ŸÖŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸäÿ®Ÿä Ÿàÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥Ÿá ŸÖÿ≥ÿ§ŸàŸÑŸäÿ© ¬´ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ±ŸäŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿ∏ŸÖÿ©¬ª ŸÅŸä ÿßÿÆÿ™ÿ∑ÿßŸÅ ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿßŸÑÿµÿØÿ± Ÿàÿ±ŸÅŸäŸÇŸäŸá, ÿ£ÿÆÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸäÿπŸä ŸÅŸä ŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜ ŸäÿØÿπŸà ŸÑŸäÿ®Ÿäÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ¬´ŸÉÿ¥ŸÅ ŸÑÿ∫ÿ≤¬ª ÿßÿÆÿ™ŸÅÿßÿ° ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿßŸÑÿµÿØÿ±, ÿ£ÿÆÿ®ÿßÿ±Libya is responsible for Musa Sadr‚Äôs disappearance: paper According to Iranian General Mansour Qadar, the head of Syrian security, Rifaat al-Assad, told the Iranian ambassador to Syria that Gaddafi planned to kill al-Sadr. On 27 August 2008, Gaddafi was indicted by the government of Lebanon for al-Sadr's disappearance.\\"Gaddafi charged for cleric kidnap\\". BBC News, 27 August 2008. Following the fall of the Gaddafi regime, Lebanon and Iran appealed to the Libyan rebels to investigate the fate of Musa al-Sadr. Political analyst Roula Talj has said that Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, told her that al-Sadr and his aides, Mohammed Yaqoub and Abbas Badreddin, never left Libya.Imam Moussa al-Sadr never left Libya According to a representative of Libya's National Transitional Council in Cairo, Gaddafi murdered al-Sadr after discussions about Shia beliefs. Sadr accused him of being unaware of Islamic teachings and of the Islamic branches of Shia and Sunni, and Gaddafi became enraged and ordered the murder of Sadr and his delegation.Gaddafi has martyred Imam Mousa Sadr According to other sources, Gaddafi had al-Sadr and his companions murdered at the request of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. At the time, the Shias and the Palestinians were involved in armed clashes in Southern Lebanon. According to a former member of the Libyan intelligence, al- Sadr was beaten to death for daring to challenge Gaddafi at his house on matters of theology. In an interview with Al Aan TV, Ahmed Ramadan, an influential figure in the Gaddafi regime and an eyewitness to the meeting between al-Sadr and Gaddafi, claimed that the meeting lasted for two and a half hours and ended with Gaddafi saying \\"take him\\". Ramadan also named three officials who he believes were responsible for the death of al-Sadr. Legacy Banner in Tyre, commemorating the 40th anniversary of Sadr's disappearance Imam Musa al-Sadr is still regarded as an important political and spiritual leader by the Shia Lebanese community. His status only grew after his disappearance in August 1978, and today his legacy is revered by both Amal and Hezbollah followers. In the eyes of many, he became a martyr and a \\"vanished imam.\\" A tribute to his continuing popularity is that it is popular in parts of Lebanon to mimic his Persian accent. The Amal Party remains an important Shia organization in Lebanon and looks to al-Sadr as its founder.

He was born in Rollag, a small community in Clay County, Minnesota to the south of Hawley. Biography Anderson received his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University in 1907, and remained on the staff after graduation. In 1908 he became professor of astronomy at the university. In 1909 he was also given the responsibility for the Rowland ruling engines that were used for creating diffraction gratings, and the quality of these was considered excellent, especially the concave gratings. In 1916 he left to work at the Mt. Wilson observatory. He remained on the Mt. Wilson staff until 1956. His most notable contribution was his adaptation of the Michelson's interferometer technique for measuring close double stars. He used a rotating mask at the focus to measure the separation of Capella. In the 1920s he collaborated with Harry O. Wood to develop a new type of seismograph. From 1928 until 1948 he was Executive Officer of the Caltech Observatory Council, working on the instrument and optical design of the main Palomar Observatory telescope. During this period he collaborated closely with George E. Hale and the Rockefeller Foundation. He died in Altadena, California. The crater Anderson on the Moon is named in his memory. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Howard N. Potts Medal in 1924. Bibliography Unless otherwise noted, the following publications were by John A.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1907 to 1922, and was Speaker of the Assembly from 1916 to 1922. Baird was a member of the Liberal Party. Baird was born in Appleton, Canada West (now Ontario), and educated at Appleton Public School. He later moved to Manitoba, and worked as a merchant and cattle dealer. He was elected as the first mayor of Pilot Mound, Manitoba, and served three successive terms without opposition. He was also a postmaster and president of the local Board of Trade, and served eight years as chairman of the public school board. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on April 27, 1905 to replace former Liberal leader Thomas Greenway in the Mountain constituency. He lost to Conservative Daniel A. McIntyre by 146 votes. Baird ran again in the 1907 provincial election, and defeated McIntyre by 433 votes. Rodmond Roblin's Conservatives were returned with a majority government in this election, and Baird sat as an opposition member. He was re-elected by fairly comfortable margins in the elections of 1910 and 1914. In 1915, the Roblin government was forced to resign amid a corruption scandal. Another election was called, which the Liberals won with a landslide majority. Baird was selected as Speaker of the Legislature on January 6, 1916. The Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1920 provincial election, and Baird was re-elected over his Farmer opponent by a reduced majority. He received a second term as Speaker on February 10, 1921. The Liberal government was defeated in the legislature in early 1922. Baird lost his seat to Charles Cannon of the United Farmers of Manitoba in the 1922 provincial election.

Its population, according to the 2011 census, was 6,533. Wingerworth is southwest of Chesterfield, south of Sheffield and north of London. Tupton, Clay Cross, Grassmoor and Ashover are nearby. History Wingerworth is first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a community of fourteen houses of freemen. In the book it is called Wingreurde, an Anglo-Saxon name meaning \\"King's Land.\\" For the bulk of the Middle Ages, the lords of Wingerworth Manor were the Brailsfords. After their stewardship, the lordship descended in a relatively uncertain manner to the Curzons of Kedleston Hall until finally coming under the lordship of the Hunloke Family. The seat of the Hunloke Family was at Wingerworth Hall, which was demolished in 1927 to make way for housing developments, as a buyer could not be found for the property. The Hall was also used as a Roundhead garrison during the English Civil War. Education Wingerworth has two coeducational, non-denominational primary schools (Deer Park Primary School and Hunloke Park Primary School). Both have around 200 to 300 pupils, drawn from the area and surrounding villages. The schools have unfriendly rivalry in sports such as football, cricket, tag rugby and netball. Wingerworth also has two pre-schools and nurseries in New Road Nursery and Hunloke Park school for children aged between 2‚Äì4 years. Secondary education is mostly provided in nearby Tupton, at Tupton Hall secondary school. Sports Football is the main sport played in Wingerworth and there are several local football teams competing in District leagues. The WJSA is a junior football association that play in the Rowsley league and has many different teams for both boys and girls. Wingerworth has a Football Pitch, a Cricket Field, several Tennis Courts and a Bowling green in the main park. Clubs and groups There are many clubs and groups in the village for all ages, including the 3rd Wingerworth Scout Group 3rd Wingerworth Scout Group for young people aged between 6 and 14, and Wingerworth Wobblers Running Club. The village also had a well-established Cricket Club who won Division 7N of the Derbyshire County League in 2013. Martial arts clubs are also run within Wingerworth for people of all ages to participate in. Demography In the 2011 census, Wingerworth had a population of 6,533 persons. Of that population, 98.3% was White, 0.6% Asian, and 0.8% Mixed/multiple.

In French they are known as oignon grelot. One English-speaking reference also mentions the term petit poireau antillais. Cultivation and storage Pearl onions are cultivated mostly in Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, usually in home gardens, although formerly on a commercial scale. They are mostly used for pickling. The majority of onions grown for pickling are common onions (A. cepa). They are grown to a small size suitable for pickling by planting at a high density. Known small white varieties include Crystal Wax,Linda Griffith and Fred Griffith or White Bermuda. Red varieties are milder in flavour. Pearl onions are ready to harvest from seed in 90 days. They can be stored for up to a month in a cool, dry, dark place. Consumption Pickled pearl onions.

Welch and Jeffrey R. Long Atomlike Building Units of Adjustable Character: Solid-State and Solution Routes to Manipulating Hexanuclear Transition Metal Chalcohalide Clusters in Progress in Inorganic Chemistry, Volume 54 Kenneth D. Karlin 2005 Link Many types of compounds are known, but all are synthetic. Octahedral chalcogenide and halide clusters These compounds are bound together by metal-metal bonding as well as two kinds of ligands. Ligands that span the faces or edges of the M6 core are labeled Li, for inner (innen in the original German description), and those ligands attached only to one metal are labeled outer, or La for ausser. Typically, the outer ligands can be exchanged whereas the bridging ligands are more inert toward substitution. =Face-capped halide clusters= The premier example is of the class is Mo6Cl142‚àí. This dianion is available as a variety of salts by treating the polymer molybdenum(II) chloride with sources of chloride, even hydrochloric acid. A related example is W6Cl142‚àí anion, which is obtained by extraction of tungsten(II) chloride. Structure of [M6Cl14]2‚àí (M = Mo or W). =Chalcohalide clusters= A related class of octahedral clusters are of the type M6X8L6 where M is a metal usually of group 6 or group 7, X is a ligand and more specifically an inner ligand of the chalcohalide group such as chloride or sulfide and L is an \\"outer ligand.\\" The metal atoms define the vertices of an octahedron. The overall point group symmetry is Oh. Each face of the octahedron is capped with a chalcohalide and eight such atoms are at the corners of a cube. For this reason this geometry is called a face capped octahedral cluster. Examples of this type of clusters are the Re6S8Cl64‚àí anion. =Chevrel clusters= A well-studied class of solid-state compounds related to the chalcohalides are molybdenum clusters of the type AxMo6X8 with X sulfur or selenium and Ax an interstitial atom such as Pb. These materials, called Chevrel phases or Chevrel clusters, have been actively studied because they are type II superconductors with relatively high critical fields. Such materials are prepared by high temperature (1100 ¬∞C) reactions of the chalcogen and Mo metal. Structurally related, soluble analogues have been prepared, e.g., Mo6S8(PEt3)6.Saito, T. and Imoto, H., \\"Chalcogenide Cluster Complexes of Chromium, Molybdenum, Tungsten, and Rhenium\\", Bulletin Chemical Society of Japan, 1996, volume 69, pp. 2403-2417. =Edge-Capped Halide Clusters= With metals in group 4 or 5 a so-called edge-capped octahedral clusters are more common. Twelve halides are located along the edge of the octahedron and six are terminal. Examples of this structure type are tungsten(III) chloride, Ta6Cl14(H2O)4,Koknat, F. W.; Marko, D. J. \\"Tetradecachlorohexatantalum Octahydrate, Ta6Cl14.8H2O\\" Inorganic Syntheses, 2004, volume 34, pp. 187-191. . (describes Na4Ta6Cl18) Nb6F15, and Nb6F182‚àí. Structure of edge-capped octahedral clusters such as Ta6Cl184‚àí. Many of the early metal clusters can only be prepared when they incorporate intertitial atoms. One example is Zr6CCl12.Arndt Simon \\"Metal clusters inside out\\" Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 2010 vol. 368, 1285-1299. = Tin(II) clusters = Octahedral clusters of tin(II) have been observed in several solid state compounds. The reaction of tin(II) salts with an aqueous base leads to the formation of tin(II) oxyhydroxide (Sn6O4(OH)4), the structure of which comprises discrete Sn6O4(OH)4 clusters. In Sn6O4(OH)4 clusters, the six tin atoms form an octahedral array with alternate faces of the octahedron occupied by an oxide or hydroxide moiety, each bonded in a ¬µ3-binding mode to three tin atoms. Crystal structures have been reported for compounds with the formula Sn6O4(OR)4, where R is an alkoxide such as a methyl or ethyl group. Recently, it was demonstrated that anionic tin(II) clusters [Sn6O8]4- may form the close packed arrays as in the case of Œ±-Sn6SiO8, which adopts the zinc blende structure, comprising a face-centred-cubic array of [Sn6O8]4- clusters with Si4+ occupying half of the tetrahedral holes. A polymorph, Œ≤-Sn6SiO8, has been identified as a product of pewter corrosion in aqueous conditions, and is a structural analogue of wurtzite. Electron counting in octahedral halide and chalcogenide clusters The species Mo6Cl142‚àí feature Mo(II) (d4) centers. Six Mo(II) centers gives rise to a total of 24 valence electrons, or 2e/Mo-Mo vector. More electron-deficient derivatives such as Ta6Cl184‚àí have fewer d-electrons. For example, the naked cluster Ta614+, the core of Ta6Cl184‚àí would have 5(6) - 14 = 16 valence electrons. Fewer d-electrons result in weakened M-M bonding and the extended Ta---Ta distances accommodate doubly bridging halides. Other classes of octahedral clusters In the area of metal carbonyl clusters, a prototypical octahedral cluster is [Fe6C(CO)16]2‚àí, which is obtained by heating iron pentacarbonyl with sodium. Some of the CO ligands are bridging and many are terminal. A carbide ligand resides at the center of the cluster. A variety of analogous compounds have been reported where some or all of the Fe centres are replaced by Ru, Mn and other metals. Outside of carbonyl clusters, gold forms octahedral clusters.

The top plate has three small holes or slots spaced 120Àö apart above leveling thumbscrews, and a locking mechanism which enables a survey instrument or target to be accurately placed on the tribrach and locked in place. The optical plummet has either a bullseye or cross hair sight for positioning the instrument over a survey marker or ground control point. The older tribrachs required a plumb line to allow them to be positioned vertically over a point and took longer to set up. Some modern total stations have an integral laser plummet built in.  Using a tribrach  Using an optical plummet. Here the tribrach is not central on the tripod plate as it is being aligned over the marker Laser reflector target on tribrach and marker column. The process is iterative between horizontal position and top plate level, because they are interactive. The following general process is followed: * The tribrach is attached to the tripod and placed over the marker. * Looking through the optical plummet pick up two of the tripod legs and position the cross hairs over the marker. Tread all three legs into the grass, bitumen, concrete. * Look through the optical plummet and using the thumbscrews put the cross hairs back over the marker. * Adjust the level of the tribrach by slackening the tripod screws and sliding the legs. Re-center the cross hairs using the thumb screws, then fine-tune the level using the tripod legs. Once the tribrach is nearly centered over the marker, level the tribrach the last little bit using the thumbscrews. * Slacken the tribrach from the tripod head and slide it the last 4-5mm so that it is centered over the marker and is level. If the target over which the instrument is to be placed is roughly at the same elevation as the tripod feet, the preceding technique is applicable. If there is a considerable difference between the elevation of the target and the elevation of the marker and the instrument bottom plate, such as when the target is in a deep hole, or on a Bilby tower, the target will appear to move laterally by a large distance in the optical plummet as the tribrach level is adjusted. Tribrachs are precision instruments and should be checked regularly to ensure they do not become a source of error. References * Gerard L'E.

It has a population of 9,042 as of 2018. It nestles in the foothills of the Mal√© Karpaty (Little Carpathian mountains) and is an excellent centre of hiking. Modra is famous for its pottery industry. Its blue-and-white porcelain is famous throughout Slovakia. It is also known as one of the most important viticulture centres in the Little Carpathians region. Besides the main town, there are also other adjacent settlements incorporated in the municipality: former vassalage viticulture village Kr√°ƒæov√° and two recreational hamlets of Harm√≥nia and Piesok (also known as Zochova Chata), both located in the woods of Little Carpathians mountains. Etymology Most experts agree that the name is connected to (blue). The name probably originates from another historic geographic name in the neighbourhood, e.g. Modr√° hora (Blue Mountain). According to a less probable hypothesis, the name comes from (a bird). History The first traces of habitation go back into the 3rd millennium BCE and the first permanent habitation comes from the time of Great Moravia, when the Slavs were living there. The first mention about Modra was in 1158 in a document of the G√©za II of Hungary, when it belonged to the bishop of Nitra. After the Mongol invasion of 1241 the settlement was reconstructed by the German colonists. The first mention about vineyards goes back to 1321. The settlement received its town privileges in 1361 and became a free royal town in 1607. The town fortifications with three gates were constructed in 1610‚Äì1647. Since the 17th century it was one of the leading craft centres in present-day Slovakia. The ceramic industry and majolica production started in the 19th century and in 1883 a school of ceramics was established, where through the skillfulness of Habaners the so-called Slovak ceramics were created. The railway track from Bratislava to Trnava bypassed the town in the 1840s, as the local magistrate refused to allow construction of the railway.

Although most are built for the purpose of recreation, some gravity racing teams take the sport more seriously and compete to win. They are propelled by gravity and can achieve speeds upwards of 164 km/h (101 miles per hour).https://www.facebook.com/World-Gravity-Speed- Association-750033185067161/ Soapbox cars Originally, gravity racer cars were built from wooden soap (or apple) crates and rollerskate wheels, but have grown more sophisticated over time, with materials like aluminium, fiberglass and even CFRP being used. In the United Kingdom a gravity racer car has been called a buggy, trolley, cart. It is currently popularly called a soapbox. In Scotland and northern England it has also been called a bogie, cartie/cairtie, guider or piler. In Wales it is often referred to as a gambo. In Australia they are called billy-carts, and in Brazil it is known as rolim√£. In addition to being built by children, there are organised competitions and races (\\"soapbox or billycart derby\\") that often engage the enthusiasm of adults. However, these are usually entered into in a spirit of fun rather than serious competition. Often they will be fund-raisers for charity. Many, but not all, events impose the following rules: *The car must have no motor *The car must have at least 4 wheels *The car may have to have some type of brakes *The driver must wear a helmet *A push at the top is allowed for speed Soapbox cars weigh an average of and reach top speeds of . Many cities have permanent tracks where drivers compete for prizes. Construction Billy carts constructed by Cub Scouts and their fathers and carers at The Rooty Hill, NSW Australia Soapbox race departure, 1938 A typical gravity racer cart is usually made of steel, and has 4 wheels, arranged as a fixed rear axle, and a steerable front beam axle - usually with a very simple single central pivot. A seat is arranged at the back, and perhaps the seat area is enclosed, as in the original soap-box design. More sophisticated designs might employ a fully enclosed body. The types of wheels employed vary according to what can be obtained easily - wheels from baby carriages, pushchairs, prams, and discarded bicycles being common. Ready-made wheels are also available from hardware suppliers. Steering is typically actuated using a rope connected to the ends of the steerable beam (which can then double as a useful manual pulling device). More sophisticated steering methods are sometimes seen. Brakes are also commonly used, and most soap-box cart racing contests require these. Often a simple friction brake operated by a lever which bears on one of the tyres, which will be of dubious effectiveness, is all that is required under the rules. Gravity racer carts are unpowered, and are either pushed by willing helpers, or are run down a suitable slope. Races will usually take place downhill and the most efficient and skillfully driven cart will win - gravity applying equally to all. Gravity racer carts also make great construction projects for children, requiring only an intuitive sense of engineering, and a few basic construction skills. There are also predesigned kits available, though for many this defeats the purpose of the exercise. Recently, more advanced gravity racers are beginning to emerge. These, intended for competition in the major soapbox races, are sometimes made of carbon fibre and feature a monocoque design, although most use a more traditional chassis or spaceframe design with bodywork made from materials such as plywood, corrugated plastic or similar. Examples of such soapboxes include the Lotus 119c and the Formula Gravity VXR Nimbus. In Australia billy carts tend to conform, even in the 21st century, to a more traditional or rudimentary specification often being constructed informally by juveniles from found or inexpensive materials with minimal adult input and used without safety equipment. However even when construction of vehicles is more formally organised, such as for the annual Blacktown and District Cub Scout Billy Cart Derby at Rooty Hill, NSW the vehicle is still constructed to a deliberately relatively unsophisticated design, although safety is a consideration. In Indonesia, billy carts are also known as 'gokar'. They are raced in different regions as a community social activity. The form of the cart is similar to the Australian one. However, the wheels are often motor cycle wheel bearings. In Brazil, gravity racers are known as \\"carrinhos de rolim√£.\\" Traditional designs are very minimalistic, with an open board-like body and wheels made up of naked ball bearings (no tyres allowed), usually discarded parts obtained from auto mechanics. Electric soapboxes are a new development and are not, in fact, pure gravity racers since they are electrically powered. History of gravity racer races Gravity race in Montreal, 1948The first recorded gravity race took place in 1904 in Oberursel (Taunus) near Frankfurt, Germany. It was inspired by major motor sports events like the Gordon Bennett Cup and the Kaiserpreis race. Gravity racer derby at a community celebration in Minnesota In 1933, Dayton Daily News newspaper photographer Myron Scott of Dayton, Ohio had covered a race of boy-built cars in his home community and was so taken with the idea that he acquired rights to the event; the national-scale Soap Box Derby grew out of this idea. In 1934, Scott had managed to persuade fifty cities across the United States to hold soap box car races and send a champion each to Dayton for a major race, later held in Akron. Scott later went on to work for Chevrolet. In the UK, gravity racer derbies have recently become more popular, brought to the masses by large events such as the Red Bull Soapbox Race and that held between 2000 and 2004 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Now, many small hilly communities organize their own races, such as the Catterline Cartie Challenge in Scotland and the Belchford Downhill Challenge in Lincolnshire, and there are now several dozen known races across the UK. An annual Soap Box Derby has taken place in mid-July at Richard's Castle on the Shropshire/Herefordshire border since 2004.Shropshire Star Wacky races as home-made carts take to the tarmac near Ludlow (12 July 2014) In addition to the local community races, there are a small number of races which attract more serious competitors, such as Cairngorm Soapbox Extreme (held at Cairn Gorm from 2009 to 2012) and the Worlaby Downhill Challenge. These races tend to produce higher speeds than the community races. Gravity racers taking part in Cairngorm Soapbox Extreme in 2011 reached speeds of 70 mph. Physics considerations A gravity racer cart rolling in V√∂lkersbach. A gravity racer obtains its energy solely from the force of gravity (assuming no starting push is permitted), which is effectively equal for any combination of racer design and course. However, performance can be greatly affected by the combined effects of various forms of drag and also the moment of inertia of the wheels, and also of course by the skill of the driver in choosing optimal lines. Drag breaks down into aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. The latter can be minimised by careful attention to the wheel bearings, tyre sizes and pressures, and brakes (to avoid parasitic brake drag). High tyre pressures and narrower tyres will typically lower the tyre contact rolling resistance, usually at the expense of grip. Larger wheels have lower rolling resistance than small ones, and rolling resistance is also proportional to overall weight. If permitted, a 3-wheeler design will have 25% less rotational inertia than a 4-wheeler, all else being equal. Aerodynamic drag can be minimised by designing a fully enclosed body that reduces the drag coefficient, but given that this can be a highly technical thing to achieve especially for the amateur builder, and given that some aerodynamic drag is inevitable, a heavier cart will always do better than a lighter one with the same drag coefficient - its terminal velocity will be higher. For this reason there are usually class weight limits in most controlled forms of the sport. Since some of the potential energy due to gravity must be converted to the kinetic energy of the rotating wheels, a vehicle with lighter wheels will accelerate faster than one with heavier wheels. If a race is started on some form of ramp, having a tail- heavy car can also improve final acceleration, as the effective height of the centre of gravity of the vehicle is raised.

It works by reducing the frequency of the pill-free or placebo days. Extended cycle use of COCPs may also be called menstrual suppression, although other hormonal medications or medication delivery systems (hormonal intrauterine devices--IUDs) may also be used to suppress menses. Any brand of combined oral contraceptive pills can be used in an extended or continuous manner by simply discarding the placebo pills; this is most commonly done with monophasic pills in which all of the pills in a package contain the same fixed dosing of a synthetic estrogen and a progestin in each active pill. Other combined hormonal contraceptives (those containing both an estrogen and a progestin) may also be used in an extended or continuous cycle. For example, the NuvaRing vaginal ring and the contraceptive patch have been studied for extended cycle use, and the monthly combined injectable contraceptive may similarly eliminate bleeding. History Before the advent of modern contraceptives, reproductive age women spent most of their time either pregnant or nursing. In modern western society women typically have about 450 periods during their lives, as compared to about 160 formerly. Although it was evident that the pill could be used to suppress menstruation for arbitrary lengths of time, the original regimen was designed to produce withdrawal bleeding every four weeks to mimic the menstrual cycle. Usage When a woman takes COCP, the hormones in the pills prevent both ovulation and shedding of the endometrium (menstruation). Traditionally, COCPs are packaged with 21 active (hormone-containing) pills and 7 placebo pills. During the week of placebo pills, withdrawal bleeding occurs and simulates an average 28-day menstrual cycle. The placebo pills are not required for pregnancy protection, and with any monophasic COCP the placebo pills may be discarded, and the next pack of active pills may be started to prevent the withdrawal bleeding. With bi- and tri-phasic pills, skipping the placebo week results in a sudden change in hormone levels, which may cause irregular spotting or flow. (Monophasic pills offer the same dose of estrogen and progestogen whereas multiphasic pills have varying doses from day to day; see formulations for details.) Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have gained FDA approval to package COCPs for the intended use of reducing the frequency of or completely eliminating withdrawal bleeding. Clinical indications Extended or continuous use of COCPs has been used for many years to treat endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstruation-associated symptoms. Some studies have suggested that women who experience premenstrual- type symptoms during the placebo (hormone-free) week of traditionally packaged COCPs may experience significantly fewer symptoms when placed on extended cycle COCP regimens. More recently, personal preference to avoid menstruation has also become a common reason for use. Personal preference is the most common reason extended cycle or continuous use COCPs are prescribed to adolescents. The Society for Menstrual Cycle Research holds that this use of COCPs does not have sufficient safety studies to justify promotion as a lifestyle choice (as opposed to medical indications), and criticizes what it perceives as negative portrayals of normal menstrual cycles in promotional literature for extended and continuous COCP use. Women's satisfaction with their contraception, compliance in taking the pills on time, and discontinuation rates are not significantly different between traditional and extended cycle regimens. Side effects With all extended-cycle COCPs, breakthrough bleeding is the most common side effect, although it tends to decrease over time. In a 12-month study of a continuous COCP regimen, 59% of women experienced no bleeding in months six through twelve and 79% of women experienced no bleeding in month twelve. Extended or continuous use of COCPs or other combined hormonal contraceptives carries the same risk of side effects and medical risks as traditional COCP use. =Ad campaign= One of the early extended-cycle COCPs, Seasonale, was marketed with the campaign, \\"Fewer periods. More possibilities.\\" In December 2004, Barr Pharmaceuticals was warned by the FDA concerning these television advertisements. As the warning stated, \\"By omitting and minimizing the risks associated with Seasonale, the TV ad misleadingly suggests that Seasonale is safer than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.\\" Although clinical studies had proven Seasonale to be effective in preventing pregnancy, the FDA felt the commercial advertisements omitted the common side effects of irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting. Brands Seasonale is produced by Duramed Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Barr Pharmaceuticals; Barr Pharmaceuticals also produces the same medicine as a generic called Jolessa. Quasense is the generic version produced by Watson Pharmaceuticals. Seasonale contains 30 micrograms of ethinylestradiol and 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel in each active pill. Seasonale reduces the frequency of menstrual periods from thirteen per year to four per year by changing the regimen of active pills from 21 to 84. Each package has 84 active pills and seven placebo pills to be taken at the end of the active cycle. It was first developed by Barr Pharmaceuticals, in collaboration with Eastern Virginia Medical School, under an agreement. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Seasonale in the United States on September 5, 2003. Barr Pharmaceuticals, its manufacturer, claimed at the time of Seasonale's approval that it would cost one dollar per pill.

Description Opuntia microdasys forms a dense shrub 40‚Äì60 cm tall, occasionally more, composed of pad-like stems 6‚Äì15 cm long and 4‚Äì12 cm broad. Instead of spines it has numerous white or yellow glochids 2‚Äì3 mm long in dense clusters. They are barbed and thinner than the finest human hairs, detaching in large numbers upon the slightest touch. If not removed they will cause considerable skin irritation so the plants must be treated with caution. The Latin specific epithet microdasys means ‚Äúsmall and hairy‚Äù. The yellow flowers appear only rarely. Despite this, it is a very popular cactus in cultivation, partly because of the young plant‚Äôs comical resemblance to a rabbit‚Äôs head. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Related species The very closely related Opuntia rufida differs in having reddish- brown glochids. It occurs further north in northern Mexico, and into western Texas. Some botanists treat the two as a single species.

It is west of Sydney. It is close to Forbes, Cowra and Young. At the 2011 census, Grenfell had a population of 1,996. The town is served daily by connecting NSW TrainLink services from Sydney via Bathurst and Lithgow. Grenfell is approximately 5 hours from Sydney and 2 1/2 hours from Canberra. History In 1866, shepherd Cornelius O‚ÄôBrien discovered a gold bearing quartz outcrop. Within weeks, large parties of miners from the Lambing Flats and Forbes diggings arrived. Tents, bark huts and a business centre grew along the banks of Emu Creek. A few months later, Grenfell was proclaimed on January 1, 1867 after Gold Commissioner, John Granville Grenfell, who was wounded by bushrangers near Narromine on 7 December 1866. John Granville Grenfell was driving a coach at the time and refused to stop when bushrangers called him to. He was shot twice in the groin and died 24 hours later. Between 1867 and 1869 over of gold were produced each year on the Grenfell goldfields and were the richest gold fields in NSW during this time. Grenfell was a goldmining town first known as Emu Creek and renamed in honour of John Grenfell, Gold Commissioner at Forbes, who had been killed in 1866 when bushrangers attacked a stagecoach on which he was travelling. \\"Weddin\\" Post Office opened on 3 December 1866 and was renamed \\"Grenfell\\" on 24 December the same year. By 1870-71 it was producing more gold than any other town in NSW. However, by the mid-1870s gold was in decline. During the First World War, manganese ore was mined near Grenfell for the production of ferromanganese. Wheat was first grown in the district in 1871. In late October 1901, the railway from Koorawatha to Grenfell was officially opened. Unlike most Australian country towns Grenfell has a main street which bends. The town's rugby league team competed for the Maher Cup. In June 2007, the Spirit of the Bush Concert was held on the sporting fields. Acts included the organiser and Australian of the Year Lee Kernaghan, local and international star Steve Forde & the Flange, Adam Brand, Leo Sayer, Diesel, and The McClymonts. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 2,573 people in Grenfell. 86.5% of people were born in Australia and 91.7% of people spoke only English at home. he most common responses for religion were Anglican 27.1%, Catholic 25.6%, No Religion 17.9% and Uniting Church 8.5%.

Beaked whales are part of the family Ziphiidae, which are the second most diverse group out of all marine mammals with over 20 species currently recognized.Dalebout ML, Mead JG, Baker CS, Baker AN, van Helden AL (2002) A new species of beaked whale Mesoplodon perrini sp. n.(Cetacea: Ziphiidae) discovered through phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences. Marine mammal science 18(3):577-608. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2002.tb01061.x Although diverse, little is understood about these timid, deep divers that can dive for up to two hours.Moore, J.E. and Barlow, J.P., 2013. Declining abundance of beaked whales (Family Ziphiidae) in the California current large marine ecosystem. PLOS ONE 8(1):e52770. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052770 The whales are partially named after their beak shaped jaw, which extends from their small head. The genus name Mesoplodon comes from the Greek meanings of meso- (middle), - hopla (arms), - odon (teeth), and may be translated as 'armed with a tooth in the center of the jaw'. Perrin's beaked whale was described as a new species in 2002 by Dalebout et al. based on five animals stranding on the coast of California between 1975 and 1997, which were initially identified as other species. The common and specific names of Mesopledon perrini are a tribute to cetologist William F. Perrin. As of May 2019, only six specimens have ever been examined. The first two specimens were found stranded on the California coast in May 1975, other specimens were found in 1978, 1979, September 1997 (a strong El Ni√±o year), and October 2013.Moore, J.E. and Barlow, J., 2017. Population abundance and trend estimates for beaked whales and sperm whales in the California Current from ship-based visual line- transect survey data, 1991-2014. https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15457 The first four individuals were initially identified as Hector's beaked whales (Mesoplodon hectori), but the mtDNA sequence database of beaked whales revealed the specimens were genetically distinct. The fifth was assumed to be a neonate Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris). Description Perrin's beaked whales are closely related to pygmy beaked whales and likely represent pygmy beaked whales' Northern Hemisphere sister species. Perrin's beaked whales have not definitively been recorded alive by scientists; however, its appearance is known from beached specimens. Perrin's beaked whales cannot be identified with absolute certainty at sea. However, the combination of small size, appearance, and a small presumed geographical range makes uncertainty unlikely. Stranded specimens can be identified as this species by either DNA sequence data and/or anatomical details of the skull. Morphology The morphology of the Perrin's beaked whale Mesoplodon perrini resembles the Hector's beaked whale M. hectori. Morphological characteristics that set these two species apart include minor differences in the cranium, teeth, and mandible. External appearances of Perrin's beaked whales are typical of Mesoplodon beaked whales, with a relatively small head, long thorax and abdomen, deep peduncle, and short tail. Only the original five beached specimens have been accurately measured. From nose to tail, the adult female was approximately 4.4 meters (~14.5 feet), while the adult male was 3.9 meters (~13 feet). The other three specimens were juvenile males, which measured between 2.1-2.4 meters (~7-7.5 ft). The rostrum of Perrin's beaked whales are relatively short compared to all other species in the genus, except for M. hectori and M. peruvianus. The rostrum of calves appears to be shorter and stubbier than adults. The teeth are fairly large and towards the tip of the mouth. The blowhole is broad and crescent-shaped, with the tips pointing anteriorly (toward the front/head; see blowhole image). The melon forms a small bulge, the mouthline is straight, and throat grooves are present. Adult males are dark gray dorsally (on back) grading to white ventrally (on stomach). The ventral side of the tail flukes are light gray with converging striations and a white patch around the umbilicus (naval). The coloration of females is not known, since the only specimen was moderately decomposed. Calves are light to dark gray dorsally and white ventrally. The lower jaw and throat regions are white. A dark gray region extends from the corner of the mouth and encompasses the eye and the rostrum, forming an extended mask. The flippers are medium to dark gray dorsally and white ventrally. There is a lighter-colored patch on the anterodistal portion. The flukes are dark gray dorsally and medium to light gray ventrally. The ventral surface includes a pattern of white striations that converge posteromedially. A photograph of a possible living specimen - one of the two observed in 1976 - is featured in Rice (1978: 95) as \\"Mesoplodon carlhubbsi\\", a distinctly larger species also native to the waters off California. Recordings of the animals' vocalizations were also gained during this opportunity.Mead, James G.

Mammal. 62(2): 430-432. doi:10.2307/1380733 (First page image) https://www.jstor.org/stable/1380733?seq=1 In Perrin's beaked whale, the teeth are located near the tip of the lower jaw and are roughly equilateral triangles when viewed laterally (from the side) in the jaw, which resembles the font teeth of Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) more than other Mesoplodon species. Like other mesoplodont whales, male M. perrini have a set of tusk-like teeth that originate from the lower jaw (see image). These tusks are not present in females. A series of long, white scars along the flank of the adult male specimen brought to the conclusion that tusks may play a role in intrasexual competition. The tusks may also help these whales distinguish individuals belonging to their species from those of similar, sympatric species.MacLeod, C.D., Perrin, W.F., Pitman, R., Barlow, J., Ballance, L.I.S.A., D Amico,A.N.G.E.L.A., Gerrodette, T., Joyce, G., Mullin, K.D., Palka, D.L. and Waring,G.T., 2005.

Substantial differences in mtDNA and cytochrome b form the basis for its diagnosis as a new species. Morphological similarities suggested that the closest relative of M. perrini was M. hectori. However, based on the molecular characters, Dalebout et al. concluded that its true sister species is M. peruvianus. This conclusion was later supported by analysis of nuclear actin sequences by Dalebout et al. (2004).Dalebout, M.L., Baker, C.S., Mead, J.G., Cockcroft, V.G. and Yamada, T.K., 2004.

Stranded Perrin's beaked whales have been found along the Californian coast between Torrey Pines State Reserve, just north of San Diego (32¬∞55‚ÄôN, 117¬∞15‚ÄôW) and Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey (36¬∞37‚ÄôN, 121¬∞55‚ÄôW). It is believed these whales inhabit the offshore waters of the Pacific coast of North America (and possibly elsewhere in the North Pacific) in waters 1,000 meters deep or more. However, the northern and southern limits of its range are entirely unknown. There is no current information on the home range and migratory behaviors of these whales, although biogeography of beaked whales suggests it does not reach the Equator. Even though current data suggest an eastern North Pacific distribution, there are too few records to date to draw any conclusions on this. Cookie-cutter shark scars on a calf found in Monterey could be evidence of migratory behavior, because in surface waters cookie- cutter sharks Isistius spp. are limited in their northern distribution,Nakano, H. and Tabuchi, M., 1990. Occurrence of the cookiecutter shark Isistius brasiliensis in surface waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Japanese Journal of Ichthyology 37(1):60-63. https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jji1950/37/1/37_1_60/_pdf but the occurrence of such scars on cetaceans is not.Jones, E.C., 1971. Isistius- brasiliensis, a squaloid shark, probable cause of crater wounds on fishes and cetaceans. FISHERY BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, 69(4)791-798 https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b2f9/9432cd9a377dc6b791174a24bd0a86863304.pdf This suggests either these cetaceans are migratory and pass through the territory of Isistius spp., or the distribution of Isistius spp. extends farther north in deeper waters and attack cetaceans when they dive. The habitat preferences of other beaked whales suggest M. perrini can primarily be found in oceanic waters that are over 1,000 m in depth. Ecology and behavior Beaked whales are timid, deep divers who can dive for up to 2 hours, so little is known about the behavior and ecology of Perrin's beaked whales because they are rarely seen. Again, Perrin's beaked whales have not definitely been recorded alive by scientists, so the limited information known about the species is derived from dead individuals that are beached. Some information is assumed based on the shared adaptations and behaviors of the species within the genus Mesoplodon. Diet Based on the stomach contents of stranded whales, these whales primarily feed on pelagic squid, such as Octopoteuthis deletron; found within the remains of in the female's stomach. Some unidentified vertebrate parts were also present. Assuming Perrin's beaked whales share the same diet as other beaked whales, they likely consume octopus and fish as well. Reproduction Little is known about the social structure, reproduction, age of sexual maturity, or lifespan of the Perrin's beaked whales, but scars on the bodies of males suggest aggressive competitive behavior. The two adult type specimens were both sexually mature and an analysis of the teeth indicated they were both about 9 years old. For this reason, it can be assumed that males reach sexual maturity around this age or sooner. The males of this species seem to engage in fights like most other mesoplodonts. Scars from fighting are present on this species, although the precise mechanism of combat is enigmatic: given the teeth's position near the lower jaw tips, it can be expected that the scars consist of two parallel lines. However, it is noted that the scars on the adult male appear to have been made with a single tooth, rather than with two teeth simultaneously, as might be expected in species with apical teeth.Heyning, J.E., 1984. Functional morphology involved in intraspecific fighting of the beaked whale, Mesoplodon carlhubbsi. Canadian Journal of Zoology 62(8):1645-1654. https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z84-239#.XeXRwuhKjIU Single scar lines could suggest they were created by glancing blows rather than direct attacks. Development The largest Perrin's beaked whale calf, LACM 088901, at 2.45 m of length, appeared to be independent from its mother. The smallest specimen, USNM 504259, at 2.1 m of length, had a fringed tongue which indicated it was still suckling. Teeth were not present in the immature specimen [verification needed], but are not needed for feeding. The dates when the specimens were found suggest the young start to feed independently in summer. Considering most whales suckle until around age one; this suggests the young are born during the summer half of the year. Since all calves were similar in size, the calves were all estimated to be approximately one year old. Social/echolocation Perrin beaked whales are thought to produce a species-specific frequency modulated (FM) echolocation pulse of BW43.Baumann- Pickering, S., Roch, M.A., Brownell Jr, R.L., Simonis, A.E., McDonald, M.A., Solsona-Berga, A., Oleson, E.M., Wiggins, S.M. and Hildebrand, J.A., 2014. Spatio-temporal patterns of beaked whale echolocation signals in the North Pacific. PLOS ONE 9(1):e86072. Within a passive acoustics study, signals of BW43 were only detected in southern California at deep sites (1100‚Äì1300 m) and are thought to be produced by Perrin's beaked whale, known only from Californian waters.  Population Status  Estimates for abundance and trends of Mesoplodon perrini do not currently exist. Data suggests a significant decline in abundance for Mesoplodon spp. in the California Current between 1996 and 2001. Declines are hypothesized to have occurred from the effects of incidental mortality from fishing, impacts of anthropogenic noise (Navy sonar), and ecosystem changes. Since then the population size of Mesoplodon beaked whales has increased from a mean of 1230 in 2001 to 3439 in 2014 within California Current waters off the U.S. West Coast.  Threats  Perrin's beaked whales are threatened by attacks from sharks such as the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). As with their relatives, cookiecutter sharks attack this whale with attempts at biting off chunks of flesh. Such attacks are generally not life-threatening to the whale. It is a host of the thoracican barnacle Conchoderma auritum, and for one or several species of parasitic Phyllobothrium cestodes (possibly Phyllobothrium delphini), this species is either a primary or a dead-end host. These whales are vulnerable to naval sonar and seismic activity. Currently, there are no whaling threats for this species. Although Mesoplodon whales were never harvested commercially, there have been reports of them being taken by humans from time to time. Bycatch is likely one of the main threats to this deep-water species due to it causing harm or death to whales entangled in fishing gear. According to the ICUN, this species has the potential to become caught in certain types of fishing gear, such as deepwater gill nets, used for capturing large pelagic fish species. Plastic is also seen as a threat to Perrin's beaked whales because it has been found within the stomach contents of stranded individuals.  Conservation status  Perrin's beaked whales are currently unavailable on the IUCN red list.

Altogether, there is a marked concentration of sightings between May and September. It is unknown if this has any significance. With scant data at hand, it still appears the best odds of encountering small beaked whales of this species is during the summer months in the area between Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands and the mainland. The causes of death of two Perrin's beaked whales can be tentatively inferred. The specimen found in 1997, was starving at the time of death, possibly following a parasite infection (Dalebout et al. 2002). The female found in 1975 had died around May 14 (Mead 1981), and its juvenile was found on May 22. Since the calf was not fully weaned, its death is likely a direct consequence of the loss of its mother.

He was a potential but unsuccessful contender for the Portuguese throne during the 1383‚Äì85 crisis of succession. Background John was the son of the Portuguese King Peter I and his lover In√™s de Castro, a Galician noblewoman who had arrived in Portugal as a lady-in-waiting to Infanta Constance of Castile, recently married to Pedro I (royal heir at the time). The status of John as Infante of Portugal is a debatable subject. Some historians consider him a natural son of Peter I, and so assert that the title 'Infante of Portugal' could not be attributed to him. Others refer to the circumstances of the death of In√™s de Castro, ordered by Peter's father, King Afonso IV of Portugal: after inheriting the throne, the Prince admitted he had married In√™s secretly, therefore she was a lawful Queen of Portugal and he was legitimized as Infante of Portugal. Life The Duke Infante lived at the Court of Ferdinand I, and was esteemed as a good knight, a dexterous rider and able hunter, valiant in shooting. He had a steady friendship with the Master of Avis, his half-brother, who was valiant and daring as he, but very different in character. Infante John was a dissembler, ambitious and bold, and would not hesitate to act or speak in pursuit of his ambition. He fell in love with Mar√≠a Teles de Meneses (c. 1338, CoimbraNovember 1379, Coimbra), a redheaded beauty about eleven years older than he, who was lady-in-waiting to the Infanta Beatrice and sister of Queen Leonor Teles. Mar√≠a was the widow (circa 1360) of √Ålvaro Dias de Sousa (1365), 2nd Lord of Mafra and Ericeira, by whom she had conceived Lopo Dias de Sousa ( ‚Äì 1435, Pombal), who inherited his father's titles and later became Master of the Order of Christ. Infante John, having gone to her house to fetch her, found an altar and a priest waiting; Mar√≠a had made the preparations for their wedding. Thus the marriage was performed secretly in 1376, and when it became public knowledge, it provoked the wrath of Leonor Teles. Upon the death of Ferdinand I with no male heir, the people might demand the crowning of the beloved Infante John as king, which would raise his wife to the throne, with grave consequences to herself (Leonora), hated as she was by the Portuguese people. John murders his wife, Mar√≠a Teles de Meneses, as envisioned by Alfredo Roque Gameiro Leonor persuaded her brother Jo√£o Afonso Telo 6th Count of Barcelos and Alcaide-M√≥r (noble magistrate) of Lisbon, to insinuate the idea in the mind of the Infante that his marriage to her daughter, the heiress presumptive Beatrice (who was promised to John I of Castile), would find favour with the people and clear his way to the throne. With the false imputation that his present wife Mar√≠a had been unfaithful to him, transmitted by Leonora through John Alfonso, Infante John became so enraged that he stabbed Mar√≠a in Coimbra. In one single coup, Leonor Teles got disentangled of her sister and brought such opprobrium upon the name of her brother-in-law, that his hopes of succeeding to the throne were much diminished. Having committed this crime of passion, John fled to Beira. Ferdinand I intended, or pretended he would, to punish the culprit, but he was soon forgiven and returned to his place in the royal court. When he spoke, however, of marrying his half-niece, the Infanta Beatrice, the Queen herself disillusioned him. Infante John, realizing he had been ensnared by the machinations of Leonora, retired to the Douro and then to Castile, avoiding the persecution that was encouraged by the cunning Leonor. Henry II called Infante John to his court and gave him in marriage his illegitimate daughter Constance of Castile, in about 1378. When the Castilian army invaded Portugal, John joined its ranks and laid siege to Elvas, which held firm. Upon the death of Ferdinand I, John I of Castile had him arrested, considering him a threat as the most direct successor to the Portuguese throne. Meanwhile, his connections with Castile eventually cost him the throne, thanks to the argumentation of Master Jo√£o das Regras at the Cortes of Coimbra in 1385. During the Battle of Aljubarrota he was already out of the country like his brother Denis, both of them having left Portugal for Castile, although during the 1383‚Äì85 crisis he was one of the claimants to the throne, along with Beatrice of Portugal (his half-niece), John, Master of Aviz (his half-brother) and Den√≠s (his brother). Shortly after the battle of Aljubarrota, John was released. He and his new wife were created lord and lady of Alba de Tormes in 1385 by the King of Castile (his brother-in-law). In the summer of 1386, he was commissioned to defend Andalusia from Portuguese attacks. Later in the year, when John of Gaunt (uncle of the English king Richard II) invaded northern Castile to try to claim the throne for himself, Infante John made a series of incursions into Portuguese territory, but failed to garner significant support for his own pretensions to the Portuguese crown. For his loyalty to Castile, in 1387 John was created duke of Valencia de Campos (renamed Valencia de Don Juan in his honor), a rank which adjoined him to the upper echelons of Castilian nobility. Castile's truces with England and Portugal from 1388 onwards seem to have eclipsed Duke John from any significant political role, and he kept a relatively low profile until his death. Convent of San Esteban in Salamanca John's precise date of death is unclear. He could have died in or after 1393 and before 1397, when his younger brother Denis, Lord of Cifuentes, received support from legitimists in Portugal (implying that his older brother, who would have had a better claim, was already deceased). The chronicler Fern√£o Lopes said that he was dead by 1397. On 19 September 1396, Henry III of Castile confirmed on John's daughters their right to succeed in their father's county of Valencia de Don Juan, suggesting that John may have been dead by then. The Portuguese genealogist Anselmo Braamcamp Freire cites a letter from John I of Portugal, dated 20 September 1400, in which he refers to his deceased namesake half-brother, but he also suggests that the date might be wrong due to statements that Duke John was active in 1402 in confirming privileges given by Henry III of Castile to Palencia Cathedral., citing John's estates were partitioned between his legitimate daughters on 2 November 1404 at Medina del Campo. None of the children of In√©s de Castro were buried in their native land. John's brother, Infante Denis, was buried at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe, his sister Beatriz in the Cathedral of Burgos, and John at the Convent of San Esteban in Salamanca.

It is located in the southwestern portion of the city limits of Pomona, in Los Angeles County, California. It is located near the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), the Orange Freeway (SR 57), and the Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71). The zip code serving the neighborhood is 91766. Phillips Ranch is 4 miles southwest of downtown Pomona, and is mostly working to upper-middle class in a very diverse community. Many residents use \\"Phillips Ranch, CA\\" as a return address, which is an acceptable alternative to Pomona, CA, according to the United States Postal Service. Phillips Ranch is often referred to by its neighborhood name instead of by the city name. History 1910 postcard image of Pomona Valley with Mt. Baldy in distance. Phillips Ranch is located on land which served as part of the ranch of Louis Phillips, who in 1864 acquired the southern end of the Rancho San Jose from two businessmen who had previously bought it from Ricardo Vejar. How much the very private Phillips‚Äôs fortune grew in these years is up for debate. In 1892, a reporter for the Pomona Progress interviewed Harris Newmark, who when asked, claimed unequivocally that the unassuming Phillips was the richest man in the county.http://la.curbed.com/2017/4/6/15171016/phillips-mansion-spadra-pomona- valley-history. In 1964, Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc. purchased Phillips Ranch, one of the largest parcels of undeveloped land in Los Angeles County, and developed 10,000 housing units.Los Angeles Times, November 15, 1964, ‚ÄúHistoric Ranch to Be Big Community‚Äù Lesser purchased \\"the historic Phillips Ranch\\" southwest of Pomona in 1964, at 2.241 acres (9,070 m2) The sale of 5,000 acres (20 km2) of the ranch in 1875 started the City of Pomona. Lesser developed 10,000 housing units in this single project. The land was originally part of a 40,000-acre (160 km2) land grant from Mexico, Rancho San Jose, granted to Ricardo Vejar in 1837, who in 1864 sold to Prussian cowboy immigrant Louis Phillips, who came to California in the gold rush. Lesser's brother Alvin was his director of development at the time, and construction started in 1965. After the Civil War, the Southern Trail from the eastern United States, through Yuma, to the California coast passed through the ranch, and the Phillips Ranch Rubottom Hotel became a Saturday night wild west activity center, with fourteen saloons, and three opium dens for large numbers of settlers, businessmen, and others. Churches, schools, and Pomona College ended the lawless element. Louis Phillips Mansion The Phillips Mansion is a Second Empire-style historic house in Pomona, Los Angeles County, California. It was built in 1875 by Louis Phillips, who by the 1890s had become the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County. Situated along the Butterfield Stage route, the Phillips Mansion became a center of community activity in the Pomona and Spadra area. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, making it among the first 25 sites in Los Angeles County to be so designated (there are now more than 450). Geography Phillips Ranch, with Mt. San Antonio in the background Phillips Ranch is bounded by the 71 Freeway to the east, Chino Hills to the south, Diamond Bar to the west, and the Westmont Ridge to the north. The elevation of the community is 800 feet above sea level, but it is as high as 950 feet, the peak being located at the northwestern tip of the neighborhood on Mission Blvd. and Temple Avenue. City government Ginna E. Escobar was elected in November 2010 to represent District Five covering the Phillips Ranch, Westmont and Cal Poly areas in the City of Pomona. In addition to currently being the youngest member of the council, Ms. Escobar is an entrepreneur in her district. http://www.ci.pomona.ca.us/index.php/government/city- council/district-5-council-member Steve Lustro was elected in November 2018 to represent District 5 seat. Since moving to Pomona over 35 years ago, Steve's involvement in school and community has been virtually non-stop. Shortly after moving into his neighborhood, Steve was instrumental in helping set up a Neighborhood Watch group encompassing about 50 residences. This led to an invitation by a neighbor to serve on the School Site Council at Decker Elementary from 1984-1987 When Ranch Hills Elementary opened in 1990, Steve volunteered to serve as editor of the school newsletter, Rattlers' Tattler, which he continued to do for four school years. In 1993, Steve was asked to participate as a community member on the planning advisory committee for Diamond Ranch High School. The committee, which met periodically until the school opened in 1997, was charged with helping select the site architect, determining when the school would open, and providing input on curriculum. Steve was elected to the PUSD Board of Education in November 1997 and re- elected in November 2001. Steve was appointed to and served on the City of Pomona Planning Commission from July 1991 through April 1997. In January 2017, Mayor Tim Sandoval selected Steve to serve as his appointment to the City of Pomona Board of Parking Place Commissioners (Vehicle Parking District), which is responsible for making policy recommendations and overseeing the operation of 26 City-owned parking lots in and around Downtown Pomona. Education Diamond Ranch High School Like the remainder of Pomona, Phillips Ranch is served by the Pomona Unified School District, which stretch as far south as parts of Diamond Bar. The community is served by two elementary schools: Decker Elementary School and Ranch Hills Elementary School. Diamond Ranch High School is located on the hills where Diamond Bar and Phillips Ranch meet. In 2003 and 2007 Diamond Ranch was titled a California Distinguished School by the California Department of Education.http://tripatlas.com/Diamond_Ranch_High_School Pomona has been criticized for its construction of Diamond Ranch High School in the city's more affluent area of Phillips Ranch because of the inequities in the rest of the school district and for the almost $68 million tab for building this architecturally unique campus in the hilly area. However, the City of Industry provided $5.4 million, and sold 80 acres of an undeveloped hill land parcel for one dollar, for the school. = Higher education = *California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona), four-year university.http://collegeprowler.com/cal-poly-pomona/off--campus-housing/ * Mt.

Early life and education  Hancock was born in 1943 in the Bronx, New York City, and raised in New York's Westchester County. She graduated from the College of New Rochelle and earned a master's degree in mathematics from Fordham University. Career = IBM = Hancock spent 29 years at IBM, where she rose to senior vice president in charge of network hardware and software. She ran the networking hardware division through the first half of the 1990s, at a time when it saw double- digit losses in market share year after year. (The division was ultimately sold to Cisco in 1999.) She was also a member of the IBM Corporate Executive Committee and the IBM Worldwide Management Council. = National Semiconductor = In September 1995, she was hired away from IBM by Gil Amelio to become National Semiconductor's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (COO). She worked closely with Amelio to move National Semiconductor to profitability. During that time, Hancock worked with National's CompactRISC architecture, which was a forerunner to the successful ARM7 architecture.Ellen Hancock with Aquicor Acquires Jazz Semiconductor = Apple = Not long after that Amelio left to take the CEO position at Apple Computer, and in July 1996 he hired her to join him there.Ellen Hancock Joins Apple as Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Technology Officer - Wayback Machine At Apple, she took over the Chief Technology Officer role in the midst of the floundering next-generation Copland operating system (OS) project. She was largely responsible for the decision to cancel Copland. To replace it, Hancock had favored Sun Microsystems's Solaris operating system over NeXT Inc.'s NeXTSTEP, and was against the eventual purchase of NeXT. Even after the deal was done, she wanted to use at least the kernel of Solaris. With NeXT came Steve Jobs, who publicly lampooned her on several occasions calling her a \\"bozo\\". When the Apple board of directors fired Amelio, Jobs reorganized the company leaving her with a much reduced role in charge of quality assurance as former NeXT executives took over many positions in Apple. She soon resigned. = Exodus Communications = After Apple she took a CEO position with Exodus Communications in March 1998 and became chairman of the board in 2000. Exodus set a Nasdaq record of 19 consecutive quarters of 40 percent quarter-over- quarter revenue growth. In 2000, the $29 billion market cap exceeded even that of her former employer, Apple Computer. However, in 2001 the company became part of the dot-com crash, the stock plummeted and Hancock stepped down as CEO in September 2001. The company filed for bankruptcy that same month, followed by an asset purchase by Cable & Wireless in February 2002. Savvis Communications purchased the related assets from C&W; in November 2004. = Acquicor = Hancock served as President, COO, and secretary to the board of Acquicor, a company she co-founded with former Apple-CEO Gil Amelio and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The company serves as a 'blank check' holding company. Most recently, Acquicor acquired Jazz Semiconductor.

He was the son of Portuguese King Peter I and a Galician noblewoman named In√™s de Castro who had arrived in Portugal as a maid of princess Constance of Castile, recently married to Pedro I (Heir Prince at the time). History Considering Denis an Infante of Portugal is a debatable subject. Some historians consider him a natural son of Peter I, so the title Infante of Portugal could never be attributed to him. Other opinions refer that after the death of In√™s de Castro, ordered by Pedro's father King Afonso IV of Portugal, the Prince after inheriting the throne admitted that he had married In√™s secretly, and because of that she was a lawful Queen of Portugal. After the death of his mother Denis left Portugal to Castile with his brother but during the 1383‚Äì85 Crisis he was one of the claimants to the throne along with Beatrice of Portugal (his niece), John, Master of Aviz (his half-brother) and John (his brother).

Eldred Pottinger (12 August 181115 November 1843) was an Anglo-Indian army officer and diplomat. He happened to be in Herat to gather intelligence on the area when the Persian army, supported by Russians, laid siege to Herat. He helped the Afghan commander repulse the Persians and was subsequently made the Hero of Herat by British propaganda. Life Pottinger was the son of Thomas Pottinger of Mountpottinger, County Down (now in Northern Ireland), and Charlotte Moore. He was educated at Addiscombe Military Seminary, and entered the Bombay Artillery in 1827. After some years of regimental duty he was appointed to the political department under his uncle, Colonel (afterwards Sir) Henry Pottinger. Portrait by Colesworthey Grant In 1837 he made a journey through Afghanistan in disguise. Arriving at Herat, he found it threatened by a Persian army (with whom were some Russian officers) and immediately made himself known to the Afghan commander, offering his services. The attack which soon followed was conducted with the greatest vigour, but the defense, inspired by Pottinger, was ultimately successful, and after a year the siege was lifted. For this great service Pottinger was thanked by the governor-general, the earl of Auckland, made brevet-major, and also received the C.B. He was also appointed Political Officer at Herat. In 1841 he was political officer in Kohistan when the revolt against Shah Shuja broke out there. Taking refuge with the Gurkha garrison of Charikar, Major Pottinger withstood a siege of fourteen days, and then made an adventurous retreat to Kabul. Less than a fortnight after his arrival Sir William Macnaghten was murdered, and Pottinger succeeded to his position as envoy to the Afghan court. The apathy of the military leaders made resistance hopeless, and it only remained to negotiate for the withdrawal of the British army. Pottinger himself was one of the hostages handed over to Akbar Khan, and thus escaped the near-total massacre of the retreating British and Sepoy troops in the evacuation from Kabul to Jelalabad in January, 1842. Released, after some months in captivity, by Sir George Pollock's army, he returned to India, and a year later died while visiting Hong Kong. Historiography Pottinger's role in the siege of Harat was picked up by the 19th century British historiography, which described him as a genius of defensive sieges, and called him \\"Hero of Herat\\", as part of the propaganda campaign aiming to show the power of the British military, and to secure British domination in Middle East and Asia.

In the general election, the Dukakis-Murphy team garnered 1,157,786 votes (65.15%) versus 525,364 votes (19.56%) for George Kariotis and Nicholas Nikitas. During her tenure as Lieutenant Governor, Murphy had little communication with Governor Dukakis. She described their relationship by stating \\"there is no good will here and certainly no mutual respect\\". Dukakis did not invite Murphy to key meetings and did not tell her when he was out of state campaigning for President of the United States. Thus, she would serve as acting governor without even knowing it. =1990 gubernatorial election= After Dukakis announced that he was not running for Governor of Massachusetts in 1990, Murphy entered the race. With strong name recognition and a solid base of liberal support, Murphy was the early frontrunner. In July 1989, Murphy led Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti 42% to 18% in a Boston Globe poll. That November, Murphy still led Bellotti, but only by 2%. In January, after Bellotti's first wave of television commercials and the entry of Boston University President John Silber into the race, Murphy fell to 20% to Bellotti's 38% and Silber's 16%. At the 1990 Democratic Convention, Bellotti won the convention endorsement with 51% to Murphy's 40% on the second ballot. Silber received 15.5% on the first ballot, which allowed him to run in the primary. Murphy's campaign appeared to be badly hurt by the public perception that she was close to the unpopular Dukakis and therefore tried to make a break with the Dukakis Administration. Dukakis twice postponed a trade mission to Europe because Murphy hinted at a news conference that she would execute her own economic plan while serving as acting governor. After the incident, Murphy's unfavorable rating rose to 49% in a Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll, compared to 38% a month earlier. A week before the primary, Murphy withdrew from the race so that she would not be a spoiler in the race and cost fellow liberal Bellotti the nomination. Bellotti would lose the nomination to Silber 53% to 44%. Corporate career In 1990 Murphy entered the corporate world. She became managing director of the law firm Brown, Rudnick, Freed & Gesmer, and corporate director of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Shawmut National Banks, Fleet National Bank, Fleet Mortgage Company, and Fleet Credit Card Corporation. Blue Cross recruited her to the position of executive vice president in charge of federal and stage media and civic relations. During the latter job, she founded Blue Cross' HealthCare Policy Institute. Today Murphy is a resident scholar at the Women's Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, vice chair of the board of SBLI USA Mutual Life Insurance Company, a director of the Citizens Energy Corporation, a director of the Commonwealth Institute, and a trustee of Regis College. She has been awarded 11 honorary degrees and over 100 national, state, and local awards. The WAGE Project Her 2005 book, Getting Even: Why women don't get paid like men and what to do about it was the product of a research effort lasting eight years. In conjunction with the book, Murphy founded The WAGE Project (Women Are Getting Even) to battle wage discrimination against working women. She has testified before U.S. Senate and House committee hearings on pay discrimination against women.

United States, 175 U.S. 211 (1899), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that for a restraint of trade to be lawful, it must be ancillary to the main purpose of a lawful contract. A naked restraint on trade is unlawful; it is not a defense that the restraint is reasonable. Facts The defendants were pipemakers who were operating in agreement. When municipalities offered projects available to the lowest bidder, all companies but the one designated would overbid, guaranteeing the success of the designated low bidder if no bidder outside the group submitted a bid. The government argued that some antitrust violations, such as bid rigging, were such egregious anti-competitive acts that they were always illegal (the so-called \\"per se\\" rule). The defendants asserted that it was a reasonable restraint of trade and that the Sherman Act could not have meant to prevent such restraints. Judgment =Court of Appeals (6th circuit)= The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted that it would be impossible for the Sherman Act to prohibit every restraint of trade for that would even encompass employment contracts, which, by their nature, restrain the employee from working elsewhere while they are being paid to work for the employer. Therefore, reasonable restraints were permitted, but this would only apply if the restraint was ancillary to the main purpose of the agreement. No conventional restraint of trade can be enforced unless it is both ancillary to the main purpose of the lawful contract and necessary to protect the enjoyment of legitimate fruits of the contract or protect from the danger of unjust use of those fruits by the other party. If the primary purpose is to restrain trade, then the agreement is invalid, and in this case, the restraint was direct and therefore invalid. The opinion was written by Chief Judge William Howard Taft (who later became President of the United States and then Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court). Taft's reasoning was subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court as the proper interpretation of the Sherman Act. =Supreme Court= This case was appealed to the Supreme Court as Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States, 175 U.S. 211 (1899). However, on appeal, the defendants did not attack the reasoning of the Sixth Circuit. Instead, they argued that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not empower Congress to regulate purely private agreements but instead authorized Congress only to remove barriers to interstate commerce erected by individual states. They argued that even if Congress possessed the authority to regulate purely private agreements, banning defendants' cartel would infringe liberty of contract because the defendants' cartel purportedly set reasonable prices. The defendants' last argument was that their cartel did not directly restrain trade but was simply a partial restraint, which ensured the defendants merely a reasonable rate of return and thus would have been enforceable at common law. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Peckham, rejected all three arguments and affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Peckham conceded that the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution likely anticipated that the Commerce Clause would authorize mainly Congressional interdiction of state-created barriers to interstate commerce. At the same time, Peckham observed that in some cases, purely private agreements can have the same economic impact and directly restrain commerce among the several states. Moreover, Peckham also held that contracts that directly restrain trade are not the sort of ordinary contracts and combinations that find shelter in liberty of contract. Finally, Peckham held that the defendants' cartel directly restrained trade. Peckham quoted extensively from Judge Taft's opinion below, which found, as a matter of fact, that the defendant's cartel set unreasonable prices. See 85 F. 291-93. In particular, Peckham quoted Taft's finding that pipe produced by the cartel could have been produced and delivered to Atlanta for a cost, including a reasonable profit and the cost of transportation, or $17 or $18 per ton, but the cartel charged instead $24.25 per ton.

It is located near the Connecticut border and has a surface area of 1,442 acres. Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables: Lake Char¬≠gogg¬≠a¬≠gogg¬≠man¬≠chaugg¬≠a¬≠gogg¬≠chau¬≠bun¬≠a¬≠gung¬≠a¬≠maugg. The name attracts many tourists. The lake has become famous beyond Central Massachusetts for having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States. Name The lake's name comes from Loup, an Algonquian language, and is often said to mean, \\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries‚ÄîNeutral Meeting Grounds\\". A more fitting translation is \\"lake divided by islands\\", according to anthropologist Ives Goddard. Today, \\"Webster Lake\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions. This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the U.S. Department of the Interior, and is the name appearing in the earliest local records. Algonquian-speaking peoples had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\"Chabanaguncamogue\\" and \\"Chaubanagogum\\".Old Webster History, from the Webster TIMES Centennial Anniversary Issue, 1859-1959. Early town records show the name as \\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\", which was also the name of the local Nipmuc town (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\"boundary fishing place\\",Trumbull, James Hammond. 1881. Indian Names of Places etc., In and On the Borders of Connecticut: With interpretations of Some of Them. Reprinted in facsimile 1974 under title Indian Names in Connecticut by Archon Books, Hamden, Conn. but something close to \\"fishing place at the boundary\\" or \\"that which is a divided island lake\\" may be more accurate.Goddard, Ives. 1974. Untitled review of Trumbull in International Journal of American Linguistics Vol. 43, No. 2 (Apr., 1977), pp. 157‚Äì159, University of Chicago Press. A 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long-form's first eight syllables, as \\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\". A survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both Dudley and Oxford, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\". Anthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond. =Long name coined around 1921= The exaggerated name \\"Lake Char¬≠gogg¬≠a¬≠gogg¬≠man¬≠chaugg¬≠a¬≠gogg¬≠chau¬≠bun¬≠a¬≠gung¬≠a¬≠maugg\\" (),\\"AUDIO: Singing a Name That's Hard to Say\\", New York Times (November 19, 2004).\\"OldeWebster Photo Archive\\" (Accessed September 16, 2015). is a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest place name in the United States and one of the longest in the world. Many area residents, as well as the official website of the town of Webster, consider the longer version correct.Town of Webster, accessed January 15, 2007. Patch using longer name of lakeThe humorous translation is: \\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\". Both the exaggerated name and its humorous translation were apparently invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of The Webster Times. According to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution, Daly created this \\"monstrosity\\" around 1921.Goddard, Ives. \\"Time to Retire an Indian Place-Name Hoax\\", The New York Times (Letter to Editor; September 29, 1990). Spellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used. Webster schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.Nipmuc Place Names of New England Geography Webster Lake is a \\"Webster Lake\\", Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, Commonwealth of Massachusetts (February 1998), via Archive.org lake with a shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border.

Although the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by a couple feet.\\"About Webster Lake\\", Webster Lake Association. Accessed September 6, 2015. The dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC. The lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. They are connected by narrow channels. =Islands= Webster Lake has about 7‚Äì8 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include: * Long Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes and has electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond. * Goat Island: The second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that include Long Island. * Well Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond. * Strip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island with one house, also in the Middle Pond. * Cobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond. * Little Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house. * Birch Island: Large island on west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on west side and swamp surrounding entire island. It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows with access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. There are many homes on island and establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion, now called Waterfront Mary's. * Small island near east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map. =Marinas= Webster lake has two marinas: * Lakeview Marine: The only full- service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake. * Point Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake. In popular culture In the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of doggerel verse which concludes: > \\"Touch not a g!\\" No impious hand > Shall wrest one from that noble name > Fifteen in all their glory stand > And ever shall the same. > For never shall that number down, > Tho Gogg and Magogg shout and thunder; > Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg's renown > Shall blaze, the beacon of the town, > While nations gaze and wonder.Poem by Bertha A. Joslin. Three songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second was recorded by Ethel Merman and Ray Bolger and released in 1954 by Decca and incorporates the tale about the lake's name according to the name's inventor, Laurence J. Daly, editor of The Webster Times. The most recent was released in 2010 by Diane Taraz. The lake is referenced in season 6, episode 6 of Gilmore Girls, \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse.\\" The character Kirk says, \\"[It is] an old Nipmuc Indian name.

Bubble Bobble Revolution became notorious for gaining negative reception after its release, due to poor graphics, level design, and the presence of a major software bug that prevents the game from being completed.  Gameplay  Typical gameplay screenshot in Bubble Bobble Revolution. There are two primary gameplay modes in Bubble Bobble Revolution: \\"Classic\\", and \\"New-Age\\". \\"Classic\\" mode is a conversion of the original Bubble Bobble to the DS hardware. Gameplay is nearly identical to the original game: players must control either Bub or Bob through 100 single-screen levels, in which they must defeat a certain number of enemies in order to proceed; being hit by an enemy results in a loss of a life. Enemies are defeated by blowing bubbles to trap them and then colliding with them; each enemy produces a food item that can be collected for extra points. The original co-op multiplayer mode is also implemented; if two players own copies of the game, they can use DS Download Play to play together. \\"New-Age\\" plays similarly to the original game, with several key differences. Characters and levels are larger (spanning the DS's dual screen), and enemies and projectiles are faster. There are additionally boss fights every tenth level, and Bub and Bob can now take three hits instead of one before dying and have several new types of bubbles. Fans are also scattered around levels, and can be spun by blowing into the DS's microphone. Rather than a co-op mode, \\"Revolution\\" includes a four-player competitive mode in which players compete for the most points in ten different levels. = Level 30 bug = All levels beyond #30 in the North American version are unplayable due to a programming error that causes the boss of that level not to spawn.GoNintendo ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Bubble Bobble Revolution DS production issues confirmed *UPDATE*- What are you waiting for? This was an often criticized aspect of the game. Codemasters ultimately responded by releasing a fixed version of the game, which included a free copy of Rainbow Islands Revolution. Reception The American release of Bubble Bobble Revolution received scathing reviews from critics, and currently holds a Metacritic score of 38/100 based on 19 reviews. Common criticism was directed at the game's dated visuals and level design. Reviewers also heavily criticized the game's number of odd glitches (such as enemies failing to spawn in levels, as well as levels being skipped entirely), which were described by Frank Provo of GameSpot as \\"strange\\" and \\"bizarre\\". Many critics also made note of the level 30 glitch, which Craig Harris of IGN claimed \\"makes a bad game worse\\". Gamesradar was heavily critical of the title as well, stating \\"If you're looking for a fresh update to a classic arcade game, this is not it.\\" John Walker of Eurogamer began his review off by giving praise for the original game before harshly criticizing the \\"new-age\\" remake. Reviewers also made note of the drastic redesigns of the original characters, which were described as \\"stupendously ugly\\". Despite the negative criticism, some did praise the game's inclusion of the original Bubble Bobble. Provo called the game \\"a genuine classic\\" and \\"enjoyable\\", and praised the multiplayer modes as well. However, Harris referred to them as \\"unacceptable\\" for requiring two copies of the game, a statement echoed by Walker. On release, Weekly Famitsu scored the game a 25 out of 40.

It is one of the primary forms of Jewish literature, though there have been cases of literature written in Hebrew by non-Jews.Modern Palestinian literature and culture, by Ami Elad, 37ff Hebrew literature was produced in many different parts of the world throughout the medieval and modern eras, while contemporary Hebrew literature is largely Israeli literature. In 1966, Agnon won the Nobel Prize for Literature for novels and short stories that employ a unique blend of biblical, Talmudic and modern Hebrew, making him the first Hebrew writer to receive this award. Ancient era Literature in Hebrew begins with the oral literature of the ' (), \\"The Holy Language\\", since ancient times and with the teachings of Abraham, the first of the biblical patriarchs of Israel, c. 2000 BCE . Beyond comparison, the most important work of ancient Hebrew literature is the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). The Mishna, compiled around 200 CE, is the primary rabbinic codification of laws as derived from the Torah. It was written in Mishnaic Hebrew, but the major commentary on it, the Gemara, was largely written in Aramaic. Many works of classical midrash were written in Hebrew. Medieval era During the medieval period, the majority of Jewish and Hebrew literature was composed in Islamic North Africa, Spain, Palestine, and the Middle East. Many works of medieval philosophical literature such as Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed and The Kuzari, as well as many works of fiction, were written in Judeo-Arabic. Works of rabbinic literature were more often written in Hebrew, including: Torah commentaries by Abraham ibn Ezra, Rashi and others; codifications of Jewish law, such as Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, the Arba'ah Turim, and the Shulchan Aruch; and works of Musar literature (didactic ethical literature) such as Bahya ibn Paquda's Chovot ha-Levavot (The Duties of the Heart). One work of fiction which was written in Hebrew was the \\"Fox Fables\\" by Berechiah ben Natronai ha-Nakdan, Hebrew fables which resemble Aesop's fables. Much medieval Jewish poetry was written in Hebrew, including liturgical piyyutim in Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries by Yose ben Yose, Yanai, and Eleazar Kalir.Encyclopedia Judaica These poems were added to the Hebrew-language liturgy. This liturgy was compiled in book form as \\"the siddur\\" by rabbis including Amram Gaon and Saadia Gaon. Later Spanish, Proven√ßal, and Italian poets wrote both religious and secular poems; particularly prominent poets were Solomon ibn Gabirol, Yehuda Halevi, and Yehuda al-Harizi. Most were also active in translating Jewish rabbinic and secular literature from Arabic into Hebrew. Only one Hebrew poem by a woman is attested for the medieval period (and is both the first and the last for some centuries): composed by the wife of Dunash ben Labrat, it laments Dunash's departure into exile.The Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain, 950-1492, ed. and trans. by Peter Cole (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 27. Modern era In addition to writing traditional rabbinic literature in Hebrew, modern Jews developed new forms of fiction, poetry, and essay-writing, which are typically called \\"Modern Hebrew Literature.\\" =18th century= By the early eighteenth century, Jewish literature was still dominated by Sephardic authors, often writing in Judeo- Arabic. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto's allegorical drama \\"La-Yesharim Tehillah\\" (1743) may be regarded as the first product of modern Hebrew literature. It has been referred to as \\"a poem that in its classic perfection of style is second only to the Bible.\\" Luzzatto's pupil in Amsterdam, David Franco Mendes (1713‚Äì92), in his imitations of Jean Racine (\\"Gemul 'Atalyah\\") and of Metastasio (\\"Yehudit\\"), continued his master's work, though his works are not as respected as were Luzzatto's. Later in the eighteenth century, the Haskalah (Jewish enlightenment) movement worked to achieve political emancipation for Jews in Europe, and European Jews gradually began to produce more literature in the mould of earlier Middle Eastern Jewish authors. Moses Mendelssohn's translation of the Hebrew Bible into German inspired interest in the Hebrew language that led to the founding of a quarterly review written in Hebrew. Other periodicals followed. Poetry by Naphtali Hirz Wessely such as \\"Shire Tif'eret,\\" or \\"Mosiade,\\" made Wessely, so to speak, poet laureate of the period. =19th century= In nineteenth-century Galicia, poets, scholars, and popular writers who contributed to the dissemination of Hebrew and to the emancipation of the Jews of Galicia included: *Joseph Perl (1773‚Äì1839), writer and educator who, in 1819, published Revealer of Secrets, the first Hebrew novel. *Nachman Krochmal (1785‚Äì1840), a philosopher, theologian, and historian. *Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport (1790‚Äì1867), a rabbi, poet, and biographer *Isaac Erter (1792‚Äì1841), a satirical poet whose collection of essays, \\"Ha-Tzofeh le-Bet Yisrael,\\" is one of the purest works of modern Hebrew literature, attacking Hasidic superstitions and prejudices in a vigorous and classical style. *Meir Halevy Letteris (1800‚Äì1871), a lyric poet also known for his adaption of Goethe's Faust into Hebrew. In Amsterdam, a circle of Hebrew-language literary artists emerged in the nineteenth century, including the poet Samuel Molder (1789‚Äì1862). Prague became an active center for the Haskalah in the nineteenth century, and the best known among the Haskalah writers there was Jehudah Loeb Jeiteles (1773‚Äì1838), author of witty epigrams (\\"Bene ha-Ne'urim\\") and of works directed against Hasidism and against superstition. In Hungary, Hebrew-language authors included Solomon Lewison of Moor (1789‚Äì1822), author of \\"Melitzat Yeshurun\\"; Gabriel S√ºdfeld, a poet who was the father of Max Nordau; and the poet Simon Bacher. A notable Jewish author in Romania during the nineteenth century was the physician and writer Julius Barasch. Italian Jews of the nineteenth-century who wrote in Hebrew included I. S. Reggio (1784‚Äì1854), Joseph Almanzi, Hayyim Salomon, Samuel Vita Lolli (1788‚Äì1843). Another figure of note was Rachel Morpurgo (1790‚Äì1860), who was one of the few female writers in the Haskalah movement, and whose poems have been described as characterized by \\"religious piety and a mystic faith in Israel's future.\\" The best known Italian writer was Samuel David Luzzatto (1800‚Äì65) was the first modern writer to introduce religious romanticism into Hebrew and to attack northern rationalism in the name of religious and national feeling. Prominent Hebrew writers in the Russian empire in the nineteenth century included: *the poet and mathematician Jacob Eichenbaum (1796‚Äì1861) *the Haskalah leader Isaac Baer Levinsohn *Kalman Schulman (1826‚Äì1900), who introduced the romantic form into Hebrew *the romantic poet Micah Joseph Lebensohn (1828‚Äì52) *the Lithuanian author Mordecai Aaron Ginzburg, known as \\"the father of prose\\" *Lithuanian poet Abraham Baer Lebensohn, known as the \\"father of poetry,\\" whose poems \\"Shire Sefat Kodesh\\" were extraordinarily successful. *Abraham Mapu (1808‚Äì67), the creator of the Hebrew novel, whose historical romance \\"Ahabat Tziyyon\\" exercised an important influence on the development of Hebrew. The poet Judah Leib Gordon, also known as \\"Leon Gordon\\" (1831‚Äì1892), was a well-known satirical poet who has been characterized as \\"an implacable enemy of the Rabbis.\\" =20th century= As Zionist settlement in Palestine intensified at the start of the twentieth century, Hebrew became the shared language of the various Jewish immigrant communities along with native Palestinian Jews of the Old Yishuv, who continued the literary traditions of earlier Sephardic and Arab-Jewish writers such as Maimonedes (Moshe ibn Maimoun) and al-Harizi. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda in particular worked to adapt Hebrew to the needs of the modern world, turning to Hebrew sources from all periods and locales to develop a language that went beyond the sacred and poetic and was capable of articulating the modern experience. With the rise of the Zionist movement amongst Jews in Europe, Ashkenazi Jews embraced Hebrew literature and began to dominate it for the first time. The foundations of modern Israeli writing were laid by a group of literary pioneers from the Second Aliyah including Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Moshe Smilansky, Yosef Haim Brenner, David Shimoni and Jacob Fichman. Hayim Nahman Bialik (1873‚Äì1934) was one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew poets and came to be recognized as Israel's national poet. Bialik contributed significantly to the revival of the Hebrew language, which before his days existed primarily as an ancient, scholarly, or poetic tongue. Bialik, like other great literary figures from the early part of the 20th century such as Ahad Ha-Am and Tchernichovsky, spent his last years in Tel Aviv, and exerted a great influence on younger Hebrew writers; the impact of his work is evident throughout modern Hebrew literature.Plenn, Matt. \\"Hayim Nahman Bialik: Jewish National Poet\\", section: \\"Lasting Legacy\\".

In parallel, a number of Palestinian and Levantine Jewish writers were influenced by the resurgence of Hebrew literature, and adopted Hebrew for their writings. In contrast to the experiences of pioneers such as Bialik, who were Ashkenazi immigrants from Europe, the Levantine Jewish writers were educated in Arabic literary traditions, and thus they incorporated many Arabic, Sephardic, and vernacular Palestinian themes and linguistic elements in their writing. Novelist Yehuda Burla, born in Jerusalem in 1886, served in the Ottoman army, and later taught Hebrew and Arabic in Damascus. In 1961, he was awarded the Israel Prize, for literature. The novelist Yitzhaq Shami was a Palestinian Jewish native of Hebron, and his work‚Äîwhich was written from the perspective of both Arabic- speaking Jews and Muslim Palestinians‚Äîincorporated diverse Arabic, Sephardic, and Middle Eastern themes. Shami holds a relatively unique place in Hebrew literature, since his writing is also recognized as Palestinian literature; in 2004 Shami was recognized by the Palestinian Academic Society as one of the important Palestinian writers. In 1966, Agnon won the Nobel Prize for Literature for novels and short stories that employ a unique blend of biblical, Talmudic and modern Hebrew. Literary translators into Modern Hebrew, most notably Leah Goldberg among others, also contributed a great deal to Israeli-Hebrew literature through bringing international literature and literary figures into Hebrew circles through translation. Goldberg herself was also noted for being a prolific writer and pioneer of Israeli children's literature as well. Contemporary era A new generation of Hebrew writers emerged with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. This new generation included the novelists Aharon Megged, Nathan Shaham, and Moshe Shamir, and the poets Yehudah Amichai, Amir Gilboa, and Haim Gouri. The novels My Michael (1968) and Black Box (1987) by Amos Oz and The Lover (1977) and Mr. Mani (1990) by A. B. Yehoshua describe life in the new state. These works also explore topics such as the conflict between parents and children and the rejection of some once-sacred ideals of Judaism and Zionism. Many Hebrew writers in the late twentieth century dealt with the Holocaust, women's issues, and the conflict between Israelis and Arabs. Another topic was the tension between Jews of European origin, the Ashkenazim, and Jews of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean origin, the Mizrahim and Sephardim. In 1986, the Palestinian-Israeli author Anton Shammas published the Hebrew novel \\"Arabesques\\", marking a milestone with the first major work of Hebrew literature written by a non-Jewish Israeli. Shammas's novel has been translated into a number of foreign languages. Modern Hebrew authors include Ruth Almog, Aharon Appelfeld, David Grossman, Amalia Kahana-Carmon, Etgar Keret, Savyon Liebrecht, Sami Michael, Yaakov Shabtai, Meir Shalev, and Zeruya Shalev. Contemporary Israeli authors whose works have been translated into other languages and attained international recognition are Ephraim Kishon, Yaakov Shabtai, A. B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Irit Linur, Etgar Keret and Yehoshua Sobol. Hebrew poets include David Avidan, Maya Bejerano, Erez Biton, Dan Pagis, Dalia Ravikovitch, Ronny Someck, Meir Wieseltier, and Yona Wallach. In the 2010s, thousands of new books are published in Hebrew each year, both translations from other languages and original works by Israeli authors.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1916 to 1922. Morrison was born in Mount Forest, Ontario, the son of Scottish immigrants who had come to Canada one year earlier. In 1878, he moved with his family to Selkirk, Manitoba where he completed his education. He worked as a merchant and was for four years the Office Trustee of Grand Rapids, Manitoba. In 1890, he married Sadie Blimco. Morrison was a Presbyterian and an active freemason. Morrison was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on September 16, 1916, in the newly created northern constituency of Rupertsland. Running as an independent, he was declared elected without opposition. Morrison subsequently affiliated with the governing Liberal Party, and was again elected without opposition under its banner in the 1920 provincial election. During this period, he served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government.MORRISON, John (Rupertsland) DOB: April 17, 1868 at Legislative Assembly of Manitoba The Liberals were defeated by the United Farmers of Manitoba in the 1922 campaign.

Palapa is a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat Ooredoo, an Indonesian telecommunications company which is a subsidiary of its namesake Ooredoo. All the satellites were launched by the United States, starting with the first in July 1976, at which time Indonesia became the first developing country to operate its own domestic satellite system. The estimated cost for the project was $1 billion. Name The name \\"Palapa\\" was bestowed by then Indonesian President Suharto, after the Palapa oath sworn by Gajah Mada, the Prime Minister of Majapahit Kingdom, in 1334. According to the Pararaton (Book of Kings), Gajah Mada swore that he would not taste any palapa (historians suggest it refers to spice or a kind of flavoring), as long as he had not succeeded in unifying Nusantara (the Indonesian archipelago). After watching the launching process of the satellite via television in Jakarta, President Suharto revealed his reason on naming the satellite \\"palapa\\"; to show that Indonesia had a glorious past, and also hope that the system can unite the archipelago. History Palapa B2, held by astronaut Joseph P. Allen, during the STS-51-A mission The first satellite, Palapa-A1 of 300 kg, was launched on 8 July 1976 at 23:31 UTC from Kennedy Space Center by a Delta rocket, or at 06:31 Western Indonesian Time on 9 July 1976. Palapa B1 was deployed by the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. Palapa B2 was launched from STS-41-B on 3 February 1984, to be put into service afterward, but the perigee kick motor (also known as the Payload Assist Module, or PAM) on the satellite failed during its approach to geosynchronous orbit, placing it at an improper and inoperable low Earth orbit. It was retrieved on 16 November 1984, by the STS-51-A mission of NASA's Space Shuttle, where it was brought back to earth. The Space Shuttle mission to retrieve Palapa B2 as well as the Westar 6 satellite which shared the launch payload with Palapa B2, was partially funded by the insurance companies led by Lloyd's of London who insured the launch of those two satellites. Series D The Palapa D satellite was manufactured by Thales Alenia Space and launched aboard a Chinese Long March 3B rocket on 31 August 2009. However, it failed to reach the intended orbit following a failure of the third stage of the rocket to reignite as planned. Thanks to SpaceBus platform efficiency, the satellite was recovered and maneuvered into the correct geosynchronous orbit by September 2009, but this left it with only enough fuel for 10 years in orbit, a third less than contracted. This US$200 million satellite has more transponders than its predecessors (40 transponders, C2 only has 36). 40% of its transponders will be used by Indosat for their own purposes while the other 60% will be rented to others. Indosat will use Palapa D for its broadband internet service (IM2) with Ku-band technology (12/14 GHz). In 2006, their total income increased by about 12.3%. With the new satellite coming up, the company hopes to earn more profits from the multimedia, internet, and communication businesses.Thales Alenia Space Press release At the end of October 2009, Palapa D started its airing operations. Only a few channels have been replaced, yet many are awaiting 11 November 2009 for the start of Palapa D's full operation. As of its release, the TV channels on Palapa C2 that have been relocated are; MINANG TV, RCTI, SCTV, Global TV, METRO TV, TVRI, NHK, Almanhar TV and Spacetoon. Some radio channels have also surfaced which have been included from Satellindo's system. Palapa D is currently running well with plans to include a new cable TV channel through the Ku-band of the satellite which is planned to include High Definition channels. New channels have also been added and replaced as of May 2010. GlobalTV was replaced by Lejel, a home shopping channel. After the insertion of Lejel TV, Global TV received its own transponder. Recent rumors states that KBS World Indonesia will renew its position in the satellite by transferring to a horizontal transponder. Lighthouse Project The Palapa project was one of the Lighthouse projects instituted during the New Order period to build national pride. Other lighthouse projects during the New Order included transport infrastructure, the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah park and the national aircraft company. Most of these involved extravagant inauguration ceremonies with the officials who oversaw the projects in the spotlight. In the inauguration ceremony of the Palapa satellite system, President Suharto used a switch with 17 jewels (17 is the date of Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence) in the shape of a traditional dagger or kris. Besides symbolizing national unity and concretely helping unite the country as the satellite served its purpose as communication infrastructure, the satellite also tied advanced technology to Javanese tradition as epitomized by the inauguration ceremony.

The trail begins at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and ends at Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park and Prentice Cooper Wildlife Management Area just outside Chattanooga, Tennessee. The trail travels through 11 Tennessee counties and two time zones. History The Cumberland Trail became Tennessee's 53rd state park in 1998 and the state's only linear park. The park is named for Justin P. Wilson in honor of his work to help make the vision of the Cumberland Trail a reality. Wilson served as the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation in 1996 and deputy governor for policy for former Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist. he is Comptroller of the State of Tennessee, an attorney, longtime Republican Party and conservation activist who donated a considerable portion of the land involved. The trail When completed, the Justin P. Wilson Cumberland Trail State Park is to contain a core corridor of trail stretching from Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park and Prentice Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The Cumberland Trail is designed for hikers by hikers as a sustainable single file back country hiking trail, part of the Great Eastern Trail, through more remote areas of the Appalachian Mountains. An alternative to the relatively crowded Appalachian Trail. it gives hikers access to areas preserved for their natural or scenic beauty that cannot be otherwise accessed. providing a wilderness experience rare in the eastern US. The rugged trail follows numerous sparsely populated ridge lines where the trail designers have strategically routed the trail to spectacular overlooks and scarce drinking water sources. The trail dips into gorges where hikers can find waterfalls and swimming holes. It is designed and built to minimize the potential environmental impact on sensitive wildlife habitat, unique aquatic or terrestrial habitats, or endangered and threatened species. =Route= Still a work-in-progress, as of November 2016, 210 mi (340 km) of trail are ready for hiking and over 300 mi (483 km) of trails are planned. Segments include: the Cumberland Mountain segment above La Follette and Jacksboro and in the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park; the Smoky Mountain segment in Campbell County; the Frozen Head segment in Morgan County; the Obed Wild and Scenic River segment in the Obed Wild and Scenic River and Catoosa Wildlife Management Area; the Grassy Cove segment on Black and Brady mountains in Cumberland County; the Rock Creek, Possum Creek, Soddy Creek, and North Chickamauga segments in Hamilton County; and the Tennessee River Gorge segment in Prentice Cooper State Forest. Management Cumberland Trail State Park offices are located in Caryville, Pikeville, and Signal Mountain.

A number of other individuals and volunteer organizations are also assisting in bringing the vision of the Cumberland Trail closer to completion. Tennessee State Parks and the Tennessee Trails Association sponsor volunteer trail building programs several times a year to build new sections of trail. The biggest of these programs is the BreakAway program. BreakAway program is an Alternative Spring Break (ASB) program managed by the Cumberland Trails Conference that allows college students to engage in volunteer services such as trail building during their spring and fall college breaks.

The son of a Frenchman by an English wife, he was born at Hough-on- the-Hill near Grantham. He was educated in Oxford, where he adopted Lollard opinions, and had graduated as a master of arts before 6 October 1406, when he was concerned in the irregular proceedings through which a letter declaring the sympathy of the university was addressed to the Bohemian reformers. From 1410 to 1414 Payne was principal of St Edmund Hall, and during these years was engaged in controversy with Thomas Netter of Walden, the Carmelite defender of Catholic doctrine. In 1414 he was compelled to leave Oxford and taught for a time in London. Ultimately he had to flee from England, and took refuge in Bohemia, where he was received by the University of Prague on 13 February 1417, and soon became a leader of the reformers. He joined the sect of the \\"Orphans,\\" and had a prominent part in the discussions and conferences of the ten years from 1420 to 1430. When the Bohemians agreed to send representatives to the Council of Basel, Payne was naturally chosen to be one of their delegates. He arrived at Basel, on 4 January 1433, and his unyielding temper and bitter words probably did much to prevent a settlement. The Bohemians left Basel in April. The party of the nobles, who had been ready to make terms, were attacked in the Diet at Prague, by the Orphans and Taborites. Next year the dispute led to open war. The nobles were victorious at the Battle of Lipany in May 1434, and it was reported in England that Payne was killed. When soon afterwards the majority of the Orphans joined the moderate party, Payne allied himself with the more extreme Taborites. Nevertheless, his reputation was so great that he was accepted as an arbitrator in doctrinal disputes amongst the reformers. In February 1437 the Pope desired the emperor Sigismund to send Payne to be tried for heresy at Basel. Payne had to leave his pastorate at ≈Ωatec, and took refuge with Petr Chelƒçick√Ω, the Bohemian author. Two years later he was captured and imprisoned at Gutenstein, but was ransomed by his Taborite friends. Payne took part in the conferences of the Bohemian parties in 1443‚Äì1444, and again in 1452. He died at Prague in 1455. He was a learned and eloquent controversialist, and a faithful adherent to Wycliffe's doctrine. Payne was also known as Clerk at Oxford, as Peter English in Bohemia, and as Freyng, after his French father, and Hough from his birthplace.

Juvenile Z. longissimus are light green or brownish-green with various darker patterns along the flanks and on the back. Two darker patches appear in the form of lines running on the top of the flanks. The head in juveniles also features several distinctive dark spots, one hoof-like on the back of the head in-between the yellow neck stripes, and two paired ones, with one horizontal stripe running from the eye and connecting to the neck marks, and one short vertical stripe connecting the eye with the 4th to 5th upper labial scales. Adults are much more uniform, sometimes being olive-yellow, brownish-green, sometimes almost black. Often in adults, there may be a more or less regular pattern of white-edged dorsal scales appearing as white freckles all over the body up to moir√©-like structures in places, enhancing the shiny metallic appearance. Sometimes, especially when pale in color, two darker longitudinal lines along the flanks can be visible. The belly is plain yellow to off-white, while the round iris has amber to ochre coloration. Melanistic, erythristic, and albinotic natural forms are known, as is a dark grey form. Although there is no noticeable sexual dimorphism in coloration, males grow significantly longer than females, presumably because of the more significant energy input of the latter into the reproductive cycle. Maximum weight for German populations has been for males and for females (B√∂hme 1993; Gomille 2002). Other distinctions, as in many snakes, include in males a relatively longer tail to total body length and a wider tail base. Scale arrangement includes 23 dorsal scale rows at midbody (rarely 19 or 21), 211-250 ventral scales, a divided anal scale, and 60-91 paired subcaudal scales (Schultz 1996; Arnold 2002). Ventral scales are sharply angled where the underside meets the side of the body, which enhances the species' climbing ability. Lifespan is estimated at about 25 to 30 years. Geographic range Respective approximate European ranges of Aesculapian snake (green) and Italian Aesculapian snake (blue). The contiguous area of the previous nominotypical subspecies, Zamenis longissimus longissimus, which is now the only recognized monotypic form, covers most of France except in the north (up to about the latitude of Paris), the Spanish Pyrenees and the eastern side of the Spanish northern coast, Italy (except the south and Sicily), all of the Balkan peninsula down to Greece and Asia Minor and parts of Central and Eastern Europe up until about the 49th parallel in the eastern part of the range (Switzerland, Austria, South Moravia (Podyj√≠/Thayatal in Austria) in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, south Poland (mainly Bieszczady/Bukovec Mountains in Slovakia), Romania, south-west Ukraine). Further isolated populations have been identified in western Germany (Schlangenbad, Odenwald, lower Salzach, plus one - near Passau - connected to the contiguous distribution area) and the northwest of the Czech Republic (near Karlovy Vary, the northernmost known current natural presence of the species). Also found in a separate enclave south of Greater Caucasus along the Russian, Georgian and Turkish northeastern and eastern shores of the Black Sea. Two further enclaves include the first around Lake Urmia in northern Iran, and on the northern slopes of Mount Ararat in east Turkey, roughly halfway between the former and the Black Sea habitats. V.L. Laughlin hypothesized that parts of the species' geographical distribution may be the result of intentional placement and later release of these snakes by Romans from the temples of Asclepius, classical god of medicine, where they were important in the medical rituals and worship of the god.Laughlin VL (1962). \\"The Aesculapian Staff and the Caduceus as Medical Symbols\\". J. Int. Col. Surgeons 37 (4): 82-92.Schmidt KP, Inger RF (1957). Living Reptiles of the World. Garden City, New York: Hanover House. 287 pp. . (p. 211). The previously recognized subspecies Zamenis longissimus romanus, found in southern Italy and Sicily, has been recently elevated to the status of a separate new species, Zamenis lineatus (Italian Aesculapian Snake). It is lighter in color, with a reddish-orange to glowing red iris. The populations previously classified as Elaphe longissima living in south-east Azerbaijan and northern Iranian Hyrcanian forests were reclassified by Nilson and Andr√©n in 1984 to Elaphe persica, now Zamenis persicus. According to fossil evidence, the species' area in the warmer Atlantic period (around 8000‚Äì5000 years ago) of Holocene reached as far north as Denmark. Three specimens were collected in Denmark between 1810 and 1863 on the southern part of Zealand, presumably from a relict and now extinct population. The current northwestern Czech population now is considered an autochthonous remnant of that maximum distribution based on the results of genetic analyses (it is closest genetically to the Carpathian populations). This likely applies also to the German populations. There are also fossils showing that they had UK residency during earlier interglacial periods but were driven south afterwards with subsequent glacials; these repeated climate-caused contractions and extensions of range in Europe appear to have occurred multiple times over the Pleistocene.Musilova R, Zavadil V, Markov√° S, Kotl√≠k P (2010). \\"Relics of the Europe‚Äôs warm past: Phylogeography of the Aesculapian snake\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 57: 1245-1252. =Escaped populations in Great Britain= There are three populations of Aesculapian snake which derive from escapes in Great Britain. The oldest recorded of these is in the grounds and vicinity of the Welsh Mountain Zoo near Conwy in North Wales. This population had persisted and reproduced since at least the early 1970s. A second, more recent population was reported in 2010 to be along the Regent's Canal near London Zoo, living on rats and thought to number a few dozen, limited by the scarcity of egg-laying sites. It is suspected this colony may have been there some years, undetected. It is not a harmful invasive species, and the population was thought likely to become extinct. In 2020, a third population was confirmed in Britain being present in Bridgend, Wales. This population has persisted for approximately 20 or so years. Subscription required Habitat In a cherry tree in M√∂dling, Lower Austria. The Aesculapian Snake prefers forested, warm but not hot, moderately humid but not wet, hilly or rocky habitats with proper insolation and varied, not sparse vegetation that provides sufficient variation in local microclimates, helping the reptile with thermoregulation. In most of their range they are typically found in relatively intact or fairly cultivated warmer temperate broadleaf forests including the more humid variety such as along river valleys and riverbeds (but not marshes) and forest steppes. Frequented locations include places such as forest clearings in succession, shrublands at the edges of forests and forest/field ecotones, woods interspersed with meadows etc. However, they generally do not avoid human presence, being often found in places such as gardens and sheds, and even prefer habitats such as old walls and stonewalls, derelict buildings and ruins that offer a variety of hiding and basking places. The synanthropic aspect appears to be more pronounced in northernmost parts of the range where they are dependent on human structures for food, warmth and hatching grounds. They avoid open plains and agricultural deserts. In the south their range seems to coincide with the borderline between deciduous broadleaf forests and mediterranean shrublands, with the latter presumably too dry for the species. In the north their line of presence appears temperature-limited. Diet and predators Their main food source are rodents up to the size of rats (a 130 cm adult specimen has been reported to have overpowered a 200g rat) and other small mammals such as shrews and moles. They also eat birds as well as bird eggs and nestlings. They suffocate their prey by constriction, though harmless smaller mouthfuls may be eaten alive without constriction, or simply crushed on eating by jaws. Juveniles mainly eat lizards and arthropods, later small rodents. Other snakes and lizards are taken, but only found rarely in adult prey. Predators include badgers and other mustelids, foxes, wild boar (mainly by digging up and decimating hatches and newborns), hedgehogs, and various birds of prey (though there are reports of adults successfully standing their ground against feathered attackers). Juveniles may be eaten by smooth snakes and other reptilivorous snakes. Also a threat mainly to juveniles and hatches are domestic animals such as cats, dogs, and chickens, and even rats may be dangerous to inactive adult specimens in hibernation. In areas of concurrent distribution, they are also preyed upon by introduced North American raccoons and east Asian raccoon dogs. Behavior Lightly colored adult. The snakes are active by day. In the warmer months of the year, they come out in late afternoon or early morning. They are very good climbers capable of ascending even vertical, branchless tree trunks. The snakes have been observed at heights of 4‚Äì5 m and even 15‚Äì20 m in trees, and foraging in the roofs of buildings. Observed optimum temperature for activity in German populations is 20-22 ¬∞C (Heimes 1988) and they are rarely recorded below 16 ¬∞C or above 25 ¬∞C, other observations for Ukrainian populations (≈†ƒçerbak et ≈†ƒçerban 1980) put minimum activity temperature from 19 ¬∞C and optimum to 21-26 ¬∞C. Above around 27 ¬∞C they try to avoid exposure to direct sunlight and cease activity with more extreme heat. The snakes will exhibit a degree of activity even during hibernation, moving around to keep a body temperature near 5 ¬∞C and occasionally emerging to bask on sunny days. The average home range for French populations has been calculated at 1.14ha, however males will travel longer distances of up to 2 km to find females during the mating season and females to find suitable hatching sites to lay eggs. The Aesculapian snakes are deemed secretive and not always easy to find even in areas of positive presence, or found in surprising contexts. In contact with humans, they can be rather tame, possibly due to their cryptic coloration keeping them hidden within their natural environment. They usually disappear and hide, but if cornered they may sometimes stand their ground and try to intimidate their opponent, sometimes with a chewing- like movement of the mouth and occasionally biting. It has been speculated that the species may be actually more prevalent than thought due to spending a significant part of its time in tree canopy, however no reliable data exist as to what part that would be. In France it is said to be the only snake species that occurs inside dense, shadowy forests with minimum undergrowth, presumably because of using foliage for basking and foraging. In other parts of the range it has been reported to only use the canopy on a more substantial basis in largely uninhabited areas, such as the natural beech forests of the East Slovak and Ukrainian Carpathians, with similar characteristics. Reproduction Minimum length of individuals entering the reproductive cycle has been reported at 85‚Äì100 cm, which corresponds to sexual maturity age of about 4‚Äì6 years. Breeding occurs annually after hibernation in spring, typically from mid-May to mid-June. In this time the snakes actively seek each other and mating begins. Rival males engage in ritual fights the aim of which is to pin down the opponent's head with one's own or coils of one's body; biting may occur but is not typical. The actual courtship takes the form of an elegant dance between the male and female, with anterior portions of the bodies raised in an S-shape and the tails entwined. The male may also grasp the female's head with its jaw (Lotze 1975). 4 to 6 weeks after about 10 eggs are laid (extremes are from 2 to 20, with 5‚Äì11 on average) in a moist, warm spot where organic decomposition occurs, usually under hay piles, in rotting wood piles, heaps of manure or leaf mold, old tree stumps and similar places. Particularly in the northern parts of the range, preferred hatching grounds often are used by multiple females and are also shared with grass snakes. The eggs incubate for around 8 (6 to 10) weeks before hatching. Taxonomy Apart from the recent taxonomic changes, there are currently four recognized phylogeographically traceable genetic lines in the species: the Western haplotype, Adriatic haplotype, the Danube haplotype and Eastern haplotype. The status of the Iranian enclave population remains unclear due to its specific morphological characteristics (smaller length, scale arrangement, darker underbelly), probably pending reclassification. History rod and snake. The Aesculapian Snake was first described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768 as Natrix longissima, later it was also known as Coluber longissimus and for the most part of its history as Elaphe longissima. The current scientific name of the species based on revisions of the large genus Elaphe is Zamenis longissimus. Zamenis is from Greek Œ∂Œ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒÆœÇWagler, J. (1830). Nat√ºrliches System der Amphibien : mit vorangehender Classification der S√§ugethiere und V√∂gel : ein Beitrag zur vergleichenden Zoologie. (Zamenis, new genus, p. 188). Available online at the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). \\"angry\\", \\"irritable\\", \\"fierce\\", longissimus comes from Latin and means \\"longest\\"; the snake is one of the longest over its range. The common name of the species ‚Äî \\"Aesculape\\" in French and its equivalents in other languages ‚Äî refers to the classical god of healing (Greek Asclepius and later Roman Aesculapius) whose temples the snake was encouraged around. It is surmised that the typical depiction of the god with his snake-entwined staff features the species. Later from these, modern symbols developed of the medical professions as used in a number of variations today. The species, along with four-lined snakes, is carried in an annual religious procession in Cocullo in central Italy, which is of separate origin and was later made part of the Catholic calendar.

Image:Coupe_d'Hygie.svgThe Aesculapian Snake with the Bowl of Hygieia as a symbol of pharmacy. Conservation Though the Aesculapian snake occupies a relatively broad range and is not endangered as a species, it is thought to be in general decline largely due to anthropic disturbances. The snake is especially vulnerable in fringe parts and northern areas of its distribution where, given the historic retreat as a result of climatic changes since the Holocene climatic optimum, local populations remain isolated both from each other and from the main distribution centers, with no exchange of genetic material and no reinforcement through migration as a result. In such areas active local protection is due. The snake has been classified as Critically Endangered in the German Red List of endangered species. In most other countries including France, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Ukraine and Russia it is also under protection status. Among the key concerns is human-caused habitat destruction, with a series of respective recommendations concerning forestry and agriculture as to the protection through non-intervention of the species' core distribution centers, including targeted protection of potential hatching and hibernation places like old growth zones and fringe ecotones near woodland areas. A significant threat also are roads both in terms of new construction and rising traffic, with a risk of further fragmentation of populations and loss of genetic exchange.

Clockwise from the left: Ernie, Bridget, George Jr, Vera, Mother, Father, Grandma, Carol, Ann and the twins, plus dogs under the table and cat behind Grandma's chair. Missing are George and the parrot. The Giles family is a fictional British family created by cartoonist Carl Giles at the end of World War II, appearing first on 5 August 1945. Much of Giles's World War II work had been cartoons featuring Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and the typical British Tommy, but he felt the need to expand after the War, hence the family. The format was a single-panel cartoon, published daily in the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers from 1945 until 1991. An annual collection was published each Christmas. Characterisation The family belongs to the better-off British working class and is usually seen living in a semi-detached house. The scenes in which they are depicted usually comment on a topic headlining the news of the day. The Giles family is patriotic but suspicious of authority. The ages of the family members remained the same throughout the 46-year run of the cartoon series, but their home, their hobbies and their dress reflected the changing British fashions and standard of living. The Giles family consists of the following: * Grandma, the most distinctive character of the series. Always present but rarely given a direct voice. She is the ultimate head of the family (despite what Father may think). She is seen using such things as skis, a motorbike, a hang glider, a Sinclair C5, and playing the tuba. A proper battle-axe of a woman, who is crossed at one's peril. * Father, Grandma's son. A mild and philosophical character. Still deludedly regards himself as the head of the family. He works, but it's never revealed where. He is passionate about boats, football, racing, fishing, betting, and hiding from the younger, louder family members. Would do anything for a quiet life and is often seen lounging in the garden. * Mother, the power behind the dynasty: she organises everyone else. Cheerfully tackles endless housework and mountains of cooking for the extended Giles family. People mostly tend to do as she tells them. * George, Mother and Father's elder son, is an avid reader and is very rarely seen without a book in his hands. Smokes a Sherlock Holmes style pipe and wears a beret and sandals. Absent in later cartoons. He is married to the skinny bespectacled Vera who constantly suffers from a cold. They have one baby son, George Jr. * Ann, the eldest daughter, and her babies, the twins, Lawrence and Ralph. The twins' absent father is a G.I.. * Carol, blonde daughter, always seen lounging about reading magazines. * Ernie, the younger son. A smaller version of Father in looks and attitude, but with a child's cheekiness. * Bridget, the youngest daughter. Wears a gymslip and has never been in any trouble because she never gets caught. * Grandma's Parrot, called Attila the Hun. * Butch The dog, a shaggy Airedale terrier. * Second dog, a Border collie. * Natalie, a black cat. * Larry (aka \\"Stinker\\"), the mop-haired kid from next door. When not up to mischief he can be seen with a camera recording the mischief or embarrassing situations involving others. Said to be the alter ego of Giles himself. * Chalkie the schoolmaster, a humourless, walking-skeleton of a man. Modelled on one of Giles's own teachers, he is Giles's revenge for what he felt was unfair treatment at school. Cultural legacy Statue of Grandma in Queen Street, Ipswich There is a statue of Grandma in Queen Street in Ipswich, England where she stands looking up at the newspaper office window where Carl Giles used to work. Grandma made a cameo appearance in DC Comics' Superman: True Brit and Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier. The appearance of Mrs. Henriot-Gulch in the comic Cerebus is closely based on Grandma. In the 1980s the family appeared in television cartoon advertisements for Lyons Quick Brew tea, one of which included Grandma racing around on her motorbike.

He is the co-founder and former executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a multinational technology conglomerate. Ma is a strong proponent of an open and market-driven economy. Ma is a global ambassador for Chinese business and is often listed as one of the world's most powerful people, with Forbes ranking him 21st on its \\"World's Most Powerful People\\" list. He also serves as a role model for startup businesses. In 2017, Ma was ranked second in the annual \\"World's 50 Greatest Leaders\\" list by Fortune. In September 2018, he announced that he would retire from Alibaba and pursue educational work, philanthropy, and environmental causes; the following year, Daniel Zhang succeeded him as executive chairman. As of 29 July 2020, with a net worth of $48.2 billion, Ma is the second-wealthiest person in China (after Ma Huateng), as well as one of the wealthiest people in the world, ranked 20th by Forbes. In 2019, Forbes named Ma in its list of \\"Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy\\" for his work supporting underprivileged communities in China, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East. Early life and education Jack Ma was born Ma Yun in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. He began studying English at a young age by conversing with English-speakers at Hangzhou International Hotel. For nine years, Ma would ride on his bicycle to give tourists tours of the area to practice his English. He became pen pals with one of those foreigners, who nicknamed him \\"Jack\\" because he found it hard to pronounce his Chinese name. Later in his youth, Ma struggled attending college. The Chinese entrance exams are held only once a year and Ma took three years to pass. Ma attended Hangzhou Teacher's Institute (currently known as Hangzhou Normal University) and graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. While at school, Ma was head of the student council. After graduation, he became a lecturer in English and international trade at Hangzhou Dianzi University. He also applied ten times to Harvard Business School and got rejected each time. Business career Jack Ma on the future of online trade and globalization at the World Economic Forum 2017 Ma applied for 30 different jobs and was rejected by all. \\"I went for a job with the police; they said, 'you're no good, Ma told interviewer Charlie Rose. \\"I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted. I was the only guy...\\". In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet and also started his first company, Hangzhou Haibo Translation Agency. In early 1995, he went to the US with his friends, who helped introduce him to the Internet. Although he found information related to beer from many countries, he was surprised to find none from China. He also tried to search for general information about China and again was surprised to find none. So he and his friend created an \\"ugly\\" website related to China. He launched the website at 9:40 AM, and by 12:30 PM he had received emails from some Chinese investors wishing to know about him. This was when Ma realized that the Internet had something great to offer. In April 1995, Ma and He Yibing (a computer teacher) opened the first office for China Pages, and Ma started their second company. On 10 May 1995, they registered the domain chinapages.com in the United States. Within three years, the company had made 5,000,000 Chinese yuan which at the time was equivalent to US$800,000. Ma began building websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the US. He said that \\"The day we got connected to the Web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house\\", and on a very slow dial-up connection, \\"we waited three and a half hours and got half a page\\", he recalled. \\"We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved the Internet existed\\". At a conference in 2010, Ma revealed that he has never actually written a line of code nor made one sale to a customer. He acquired a computer for the first time at the age of 33. From 1998 to 1999, Ma headed an information technology company established by the China International Electronic Commerce Center, a department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In 1999, he quit and returned to Hangzhou with his team to found Alibaba, a China-based business-to-business marketplace site in his apartment with a group of 18 friends. He started a new round of venture development with 500,000 yuan. leftIn October 1999 and January 2000, Alibaba twice won a total of a $25 million foreign venture capital investment. The program was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for Chinese enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to address World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges. Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system and from 2003 he founded Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Ali Mama and Lynx. After the rapid rise of Taobao, eBay offered to purchase the company. However, Ma rejected their offer, instead gathering support from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang with a $1 billion investment. In September 2014 it was reported Alibaba was raising over $25 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange. Alibaba became one of the most valuable technology companies in the world after raising the full $25 billion, the largest initial public offering in US financial history. Ma served as executive chairman of Alibaba Group, which is a holding company with nine major subsidiaries: Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan, 1688.com, AliExpress.com, and Alipay. In November 2012, Alibaba's online transaction volume exceeded one trillion yuan. , Ma is the owner of Ch√¢teau de Sours in Bordeaux, Chateau Guerry in C√¥tes de Bourg and Ch√¢teau Perenne in Blaye, C√¥tes de Bordeaux. In 2015 he founded the Hupan School, a business school. On 9 January 2017, Ma met with United States President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, to discuss the potential of 1 million job openings in the following five years through Alibaba's interest in the country. On 8 September 2017, to celebrate Alibaba's 18th year of establishment, Ma appeared on stage and gave a Michael-Jackson-inspired performance. He performed part of \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\\" at the 2009 Alibaba birthday event while dressed as a heavy metal lead singer. In the same month, Ma also partnered with Sir Li Ka-shing in a joint venture to offer a digital wallet service in Hong Kong. Ma announced on 10 September 2018 that he would step down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding in the coming year. Ma denied reports that he was forced to step aside by the Chinese government and stated that he wants to focus on philanthropy through his foundation. Daniel Zhang would then lead the way ahead for Alibaba as the current executive chairman. Ma officially stepped down from the board of Alibaba on September 30, 2020. Entertainment career  In 2017, Ma made his acting debut with his first kung fu short film Gong Shou Dao. It was filmed in collaboration with the Double 11 Shopping Carnival Singles' Day. In the same year, he also participated in a singing festival and performed dances during Alibaba's 18th-anniversary party.

At the annual general meeting of shareholders for Alibaba.com in May 2010, Ma announced Alibaba Group would begin in 2010 to earmark 0.3% of annual revenue to environmental protection, particularly on water- and air-quality improvement projects. Of the future of Alibaba, he has said, \\"our challenge is to help more people to make healthy money, 'sustainable money', money that is not only good for themselves but also good for the society. That's the transformation we are aiming to make.\\" On 24 September 2014, in an interview with Taobao, Ma attributed the strength of American society to its Christian heritage, and expressed his belief in the importance for China to implement a positive value system, in order to overcome the legacy of the Cultural Revolution. In November 2018, the People's Daily identified Ma as a member of the Communist Party of China, something which surprised observers. Ma received international criticism after he publicly endorsed the Chinese work practice known as the 996 working hour system. When asked in 2019 to give his views on the future, Ma again stated that 996 was currently a \\"huge blessing\\" necessary to achieve success, but went on to state that artificial intelligence technology might lead to a better life of leisure in the future, where people would only have to work four-hour work days, three days a week. At the same time, Ma expressed skepticism that AI could ever completely replace people, referencing to his theory that success requires a \\"love quotient\\" and stating that machines can never match this success. Ma also predicted that population collapse would become a big problem in the future.  Philanthropy  Jack Ma is the founder of the Jack Ma Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused on improving education, the environment and public health. In 2008, Alibaba donated $808,000 to victims of the Sichuan earthquake. In 2009 Jack Ma became a trustee of The Nature Conservancy's China program, and in 2010 he joined the global Board of Directors of the organization. In 2015, Alibaba launched a non-profit organization, Alibaba Hong Kong Young Entrepreneurs Foundation, which supports Hong Kong entrepreneurs to help them grow their businesses. During the same year, the company funded the rebuilding of 1,000 houses damaged by the earthquake-hit in Nepal, and raised money for another 9,000. In September 2018 Ma started the Jack Ma Foundation and announced that he would retire from Alibaba to pursue educational work, philanthropy, and environmental causes. In 2019, Forbes named Ma in its list of \\"Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy\\" and awarded him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award for his work supporting underprivileged communities in China, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East. In 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Alibaba Foundation and Jack Ma Foundation launched various initiatives, some of which involved donating medical supplies to the United States as well as various countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

It has an area of . History The area of the park was inhabited 10,000 years ago by the hunter-gatherers of the Eldoradense culture. They were displaced around 1,000 CE by the Guaran√≠, who brought new agricultural technologies, and were displaced in turn by the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadores in the 16th century, though their legacy is still alive in this area (the name of the park and the river is Guaran√≠ y guasu, \\"large water\\"). The first European to visit the zone was √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, in 1542; Jesuit missions followed in 1609. The park was created in 1934 to protect one of the greatest natural beauties of Argentina, the Iguazu Falls, surrounded by the subtropical jungle. The Iguaz√∫ National Reserve was defined by law 18.801 of 7 October 1970 as constituting the western part of the Iguaz√∫ National Park. While the national park preserves nature with the least possible alteration, the reserve admits human activities and infrastructure. Creation of the reserve allowed construction of an international airport and alienation of land for three tourist hotels. Across the Iguazu River lies its Brazilian counterpart (Igua√ßu National Park). Both sites were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO, in 1984. The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paran√° ecoregion. The southeast of the park adjoins the Urugua-√≠ Provincial Park, created in 1990. Flora and fauna The park lies within the Alto Paran√° Atlantic forests ecoregion. The fauna of the park includes several rare and threatened species: jaguar, jaguarundi, South American tapir, ocelot, tirica, anteater, the black-fronted piping guan, the harpy eagle, and the yacare caiman. One can also find birds like the great dusky swift and large toucans, mammals like the coat√≠, and a diversity of butterflies. The vinaceous amazon, named for its wine-colored plumage, is occasionally found in this park. The Iguaz√∫ River ends in the Paran√° River 23 km beyond the falls, after a 1320 km course. Inside the park it becomes up to 1,500 m wide and turns first south, then north, forming a large U-shape. Its banks are densely populated by trees, including the ceibo (Cockspur coral tree), whose flower is Argentina's national flower. The flora of the park also features lapacho negro and lapacho amarillo (family Bignoniaceae), as well as palmito trees and the 40-metre-high palo rosa (family Apocynaceae).

The air mass information is necessary for the engine control unit (ECU) to balance and deliver the correct fuel mass to the engine. Air changes its density with temperature and pressure. In automotive applications, air density varies with the ambient temperature, altitude and the use of forced induction, which means that mass flow sensors are more appropriate than volumetric flow sensors for determining the quantity of intake air in each cylinder. There are two common types of mass airflow sensors in use on automotive engines. These are the vane meter and the hot wire. Neither design employs technology that measures air mass directly. However, with additional sensors and inputs, an engine's ECU can determine the mass flow rate of intake air. Both approaches are used almost exclusively on electronic fuel injection (EFI) engines. Both sensor designs output a 0.0‚Äì5.0 volt or a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal that is proportional to the air mass flow rate, and both sensors have an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor incorporated into their housings for most post on-board diagnostics (OBDII) vehicles. Vehicles prior to 1996 could have MAF without an IAT. An example is 1994 Infiniti Q45. When a MAF sensor is used in conjunction with an oxygen sensor, the engine's air/fuel ratio can be controlled very accurately. The MAF sensor provides the open-loop controller predicted air flow information (the measured air flow) to the ECU, and the oxygen sensor provides closed-loop feedback in order to make minor corrections to the predicted air mass. Also see manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP sensor). Moving vane meter Intake-air flap type flowmeter The VAF (volume air flow) sensor measures the air flow into the engine with a spring-loaded air vane (flap/door) attached to a variable resistor (potentiometer). The vane moves in proportion to the airflow. A voltage is applied to the potentiometer and a voltage appears on the output terminal of the potentiometer proportional to the angle the vane rotates, or the movement of the vane may directly regulate the amount of fuel injected, as in the K-Jetronic system. Many VAF sensors have an air-fuel adjustment screw, which opens or closes a small air passage on the side of the VAF sensor. This screw controls the air-fuel mixture by letting a metered amount of air flow past the air flap, thereby leaning or richening the mixture. By turning the screw clockwise the mixture is enriched and counterclockwise the mixture is leaned. The vane moves because of the drag force of the air flow against it; it does not measure volume or mass directly. The drag force depends on air density (air density in turn depends on air temperature), air velocity and the shape of the vane, see drag equation. Some VAF sensors include an additional intake air temperature sensor (IAT sensor) to allow the engines ECU to calculate the density of the air, and the fuel delivery accordingly. The vane meter approach has some drawbacks: *it restricts airflow which limits engine output *its moving electrical or mechanical contacts can wear *finding a suitable mounting location within a confined engine compartment is problematic *the vane has to be oriented with respect to gravity. *in some manufacturers fuel pump control was also part on the VAF internal wiring. Hot wire sensor (MAF) A hot wire mass airflow sensor determines the mass of air flowing into the engine‚Äôs air intake system. The theory of operation of the hot wire mass airflow sensor is similar to that of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine‚Äôs air stream, like a toaster wire, by applying a constant voltage over the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire‚Äôs temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire‚Äôs temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The current increase or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU. If air density increases due to pressure increase or temperature drop, but the air volume remains constant, the denser air will remove more heat from the wire indicating a higher mass airflow. Unlike the vane meter's paddle sensing element, the hot wire responds directly to air density. This sensor's capabilities are well suited to support the gasoline combustion process which fundamentally responds to air mass, not air volume. (See stoichiometry.) This sensor sometimes employs a mixture screw, but this screw is fully electronic and uses a variable resistor (potentiometer) instead of an air bypass screw. The screw needs more turns to achieve the desired results. A hot wire burn-off cleaning circuit is employed on some of these sensors. A burn-off relay applies a high current through the platinum hot wire after the vehicle is turned off for a second or so, thereby burning or vaporizing any contaminants that have stuck to the platinum hot wire element. The hot film MAF sensor works somewhat similar to the hot wire MAF sensor, but instead it usually outputs a frequency signal. This sensor uses a hot film-grid instead of a hot wire. It is commonly found in late 1980s and early 1990s fuel-injected vehicles. The output frequency is directly proportional to the air mass entering the engine. So as mass flow increases so does frequency. These sensors tend to cause intermittent problems due to internal electrical failures. The use of an oscilloscope is strongly recommended to check the output frequency of these sensors. Frequency distortion is also common when the sensor starts to fail. Many technicians in the field use a tap test with very conclusive results. Not all HFM systems output a frequency. In some cases, this sensor works by outputting a regular varying voltage signal. Some of the benefits of a hot-wire MAF compared to the older style vane meter are: *responds very quickly to changes in air flow *low airflow restriction *smaller overall package *less sensitive to mounting location and orientation *no moving parts improve its durability *less expensive *separate temperature and pressure sensors are not required to determine air mass, even though the intake air temperature sensor is still sometimes included inside the MAF assembly. There are some drawbacks: *dirt and oil can contaminate the hot-wire deteriorating its accuracy *installation requires a laminar flow across the hot-wire *the sensor contains a thin platinum wire, which can break if handled incorrectly Coldwire sensor A Holden Commodore's MAF sensor The GM LS engine series (as well as others) use a coldwire MAF system (produced by AC Delco) that works similarly to the hot- wire MAF system; however, it uses an additional \\"cold\\" resistor to measure the ambient air and provide a reference for the \\"hot\\" resistor element used to measure the air flow. The mesh on the MAF is used to smooth out airflow to ensure the sensors have the best chance of a steady reading. It is not used for measuring the air flow per se. In situations where owners use oiled-gauze air filters, it is possible for excess oil to coat the MAF sensor and skew its readings. Indeed, General Motors has issued a Technical Service Bulletin, indicating problems from rough idle all the way to possible transmission damage resulting from the contaminated sensors. To clean the delicate MAF sensor components, a specific MAF sensor cleaner or electronics cleaner should be used, not carburetor or brake cleaners, which can be too aggressive chemically. Instead, the liquid phase of MAF sensor cleaners and electronics cleaners is typically based on hexanes or heptanes with little to no alcohol content and use either carbon dioxide or HFC-152a as aerosol propellants. The sensors should be gently sprayed from a careful distance to avoid physically damaging them and then allowed to thoroughly dry before reinstalling. Manufacturers claim that a simple but extremely reliable test to ensure correct functionality is to tap the unit with the back of a screwdriver while the car is running, and if this causes any changes in the output frequency then the unit should be discarded and an OEM replacement installed. K√°rm√°n vortex sensor A von K√°rm√°n vortex street A K√°rm√°n vortex sensor works by disrupting the air stream with a perpendicular bow. Providing that the incoming flow is laminar, the wake consists of an oscillatory pattern of K√°rm√°n vortices. The frequency of the resulting pattern is proportional to the air velocity. These vortices can either be read directly as a pressure pulse against a sensor, or they can be made to collide with a mirror which will then interrupt or transmit a reflected light beam to generate the pulses in response to the vortices. The first type can only be used in pull-thru air (prior to a turbo- or supercharger), while the second type could theoretically be used push- or pull-thru air (before or after a forced induction application like the previously mentioned super- or turbocharger). Instead of outputting a constant voltage modified by a resistance factor, this type of MAF outputs a frequency which must then be interpreted by the ECU. This type of MAF can be found on all DSMs (Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon, Plymouth Laser), many Mitsubishis, some Toyotas and Lexus, and some BMWs, among others. Membrane sensor An emerging technology utilizes a very thin electronic membrane placed in the air stream. The membrane has a thin film temperature sensor printed on the upstream side, and one on the downstream side. A heater is integrated in the center of the membrane which maintains a constant temperature similar to the hot-wire approach. Without any airflow, the temperature profile across the membrane is uniform. When air flows across the membrane, the upstream side cools differently from the downstream side. The difference between the upstream and downstream temperature indicates the mass airflow. The thermal membrane sensor is also capable of measuring flow in both directions, which sometimes occur in pulsating situations. Technological progress allows this kind of sensor to be manufactured on the microscopic scale as microsensors using microelectromechanical systems technology. Such a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. See also MEMS sensor generations. Laminar flow elements Laminar flow elements measure the volumetric flow of gases directly. They operate on the principle that, given laminar flow, the pressure difference across a pipe is linear to the flow rate. Laminar flow conditions are present in a gas when the Reynolds number of the gas is below the critical figure. The viscosity of the fluid must be compensated for in the result. Laminar flow elements are usually constructed from a large number of parallel pipes to achieve the required flow rating.

Along with frame builder Steve Potts and his helper Mark Slate, Cunningham co-founded Wilderness Trail Bikes (WTB). Cunningham and Potts were forced out of WTB in 2002 for undisclosed reasons, at the urging of WTB's CEO, Patrick Seidler. Cunningham and his wife Jacquie Phelan are charter inductees to Crested Butte's Mountain Bike Hall of Fame. Early life Cunningham came from an Air Force family, who lived in Alabama, Virginia, Japan and San Diego during his childhood, ultimately settling in Mill Valley on Mt Tamalpais, Marin County. His father, Bruce Cunningham, was a World War II and Korean War fighter pilot who won the Thompson Trophy in 1949, the only year military jets (F-86) competed. His mother, Carol, was a book artist whose imprint Sunflower Press is found in several museum collections. In his twenties, Cunningham studied nutrition, water quality, and chemistry, as well as engineering. At 25 he recognized that automobile use in the USA is largely wasteful, polluting, and socially ruinous, and therefore turned to bicycles. Inventions In the early 1980s, Cunningham invented a number of features for use on modern mountain bikes: *tubular-style fork crowns *135 mm lower-dish rear wheel for mountain bikes, which are now the standard *identifying the fundamental tread design principles needed for well- performing mountain bike tires. Cunningham co-designed Ground Control, a tire incorporating these principles. *the Grease Guard Bearing System that allows bicyclists to replace the dirty grease that gets into bicycle bearings with clean grease in seconds, thus extending component life and saving time and money spent fixing and/or replacing parts. *the Roller Cam Brake. The brake arms, the pivot mounting location, and the linkage combined to eliminate flex in the fork blades and frame stays. This brake also featured the linear spring he invented, now used on almost all V-Brakes today. The cam was eventually replaced with the Lever Link. Competitive career Cunningham raced competitively in 1984, placing 10th overall at the NORBA championships in Nederland, Colorado. He became National Vet Champion aged 36. Cunningham built a total of 187 aluminum bicycles (the Indian, the Racer, and the Wombat for smaller people) between 1979‚Äì1992. They were guaranteed for life, and cost about six times as much as custom (steel) bikes. He is now a freelance inventor working on environmentally sustainable projects.

It straddles the boundary of Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council jurisdictions. The character of the area has changed in the last 100 years, from a district centred on a large estate, and later small village, to a modern, rather dispersed, mixed-use suburb. Much of the old village is gone and where there were once fields full of crops, and wild woodlands of all sorts, there are now housing estates, an athletics stadium, a shopping complex, industrial parks and busy roads leading to Dublin Airport. Trinity College Library has a depository at Santry which holds three million books. Santry is also the name of a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.Placenames Database of Ireland - Santry civil parish History Santry is an anglicisation of the Irish placename Seantrabh (pronounced Shan- treev) which literally means \\"old tribe\\". Although not verified, the book of Leccan refers to a tribe called the Almanii who inhabited the area, which might have been the source of the name. During the Viking invasions a number of peaceful Norse farmers moved into the north Dublin area, which proved to be excellent farmland. These Norsemen were famous for their agricultural prowess, crafts . They also brought new pastimes and strange Scandinavian phrases which are thought to survive to today further away from the city. After this time people began to refer to the area north of the River Tolka, including from Santry and north to Swords, Lusk, and beyond as \\"Fingal\\", which translates as \\"fair-haired foreigner\\". The name was confined to songs, poems, folk memory and some antiquarian titles until a re-organization of local government in the 1990s set up Fingal and Fingal County Council. In the 12th century, the neighbourhood of Santry was at the hands of Mac Gilla Mocholmog, chief of Fingal, who then established his base in Santry. About 1170 Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath granted Santry to one of his most trusted lieutenants, Adam de Feypo. In 1581 the lands and title of Santry were awarded to William Nugent who then lost it after falling out of favour with the Crown because of his religion. In 1620 the lands of Santry were confiscated from Nugent's aristocratic but Catholic offspring, the Barnewalls. The Protestant Barry family (originally from Cork) took charge of the estate and tenants and became the Lords of Santry where they remained in title for three or four generations. King Charles II made James Barry, then only a knight, Baron Barry of Santry (for services rendered). Santry was the scene of violence in the early months of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when a punitive expedition of Parliamentarians led by Sir Charles Coote mistakenly massacred a group of local farm labourers, who were sleeping in the fields there. Coote had assumed they were rebels preparing to attack Dublin. In the Irish Rebellion of 1798 United Irishmen from all over Fingal marched south towards Dublin city but were met by a company of local yeomanry (government militia) from Santry village and were massacred. The bloodshed was so bad in this action that the area at the northern gateway to Santry Demesne (now near the Little Venice Restaurant) was known as \\"Bloody Hollows\\" for several years after. Later a Royal Irish Constabulary station was located on the site of the present-day restaurant. In recent decades suburban housing estates have been built around Santry, including most recently some initially controversial developments within Santry Demesne. Hotels have also appeared. Features =Santry Demesne (Santry Court)= Santry Demesne (also referred to as Santry Park or Santry Woods) is a demesne in Dublin, Ireland. It is in the Fingal County Council district of Dublin. Morton Stadium, the National Athletics Stadium of Ireland, is right beside it. It contains a walled garden. a lake, monuments and has the Santry River going through it. It was the venue for the European Cross Country Championships in 2009. Where the new Santry Demesne public park is situated was once a palatial old house and gardens, built in the 18th century. This was once the largest house in north County Dublin and people travelled from far and wide to be received by the owners, the Barry family.Santry House www.dumville.org. Many clues of the house still exist and the park is worth visiting to find the house foundations, front steps, tree avenue and walled garden. A small bend in the Santry River (which forms the boundary of the park today) was widened to create a small pond for the boating pleasure of Georgian ladies and gentlemen who resided at, and visited, the house. In 1912 King Victor Emmanuel of Italy presented the Barrys/Domvilles with a gift of 16 foreign tree species.History Santry Woods www.geocaching.com The house fell into disrepair, initially at the turn of the 20th century as the estate proved not to be economically viable but ultimately after the Domville family departed Ireland post-independence in 1921. It came into the possession of the state, who intended to repair it and use it as a mental asylum. This plan was shelved by the start of World War II; the need to increase security around Dublin Airport meant it was used as an army depot, and part of the gardens as a firing range. There are many theories locally about what happened next but it appears as if soldiers of the Irish army caused a fire and the house was severely damaged in 1947, followed by demolition shortly afterwards. In 1972 part of the Demense was sold to Trinity College Dublin, which was developed as a sports grounds, as well as a Book storage facility for its libraries.Save Santry Wood for the people by Robert Allen, An Phoblacht, November 6, 1997. In 2010 the walled garden is leased to a community group which runs it as a Community Garden, the 4 acre plot is divided into three sections an ornamental section, heritage and kitchen garden.Santry Community Garden Website Many varieties of plants, vegetables and fruit are grown by the 90 volunteers in the garden, since 2013 there is also a bee apiary. A number of tree species in Santry include native trees such as oak, ash, beech and rowan, as well as the more exotic Spanish chestnuts, Californian redwood (Sequoias), Italian walnut, Lebanon cedar, Horse chestnut, Sweet chestnut, Beech, Ever green Oak, and Chinese Pines. =Description of the house= Santry Court was an important Jacobean type early 18th-century house of red brick and stone facings built in 1703 by 3rd. Lord Barry of Santry, commonly called Lord Santry. Two storeys high over an exceptionally tall basement, and with a dormered attic behind the roof parapet. The dormer windows alternated with segmental and triangular pediments. Facade was 9 bays wide on the entrance front with pedimented breakfront. The front door with segmental pediment and Corinthian columns at the top of a huge flight of steps. Originally the front door was at basement level (the door was relocated to Dublin Castle.) The parapets were partly balustraded with urns at each corner. Curved sweeps and wings were added later, probably 1740‚Äì1750. The garden front was also of 9 bays with the wings beyond. The house had a fine interior, a large hall, with sandstone mantlepiece, and unusually high doors, a staircase of wood with barley sugar balusters, Corinthian newels, and carved acanthus decoration (similar to those at Saunders Grove and Mount Levers). The dining room with plaster panelled walls and a plaster ceiling in low relief, mahogany door frames and dado which were a later addition. The window shutters of oak were probably original. The study was panelled in pine and had a good Adam-style mantlepiece. The morning room had very deep window seats in oak, and corner fireplace. The attic rooms were unusual insofar as the corridor was around the perimeter and the staff bedrooms internal. A domed temple (garden pavilion) was removed and is retained at Luggala, County Wicklow. A bridge over the river had balustrades and lions. After being gutted in a fire in the 20th century, the house was eventually demolished. =Santry family= The house was built by the 3rd Lord Barry of Santry in 1703. Steps and wings were added by Henry Barry, 4th Baron Barry of Santry 1740‚Äì50, who was a member of the Hell Fire Club, and was convicted of the murder of a porter at an inn in Palmerstown 1739. He received the death penalty but was reprieved and lost his title. After the death of Lord Barry of Santry in 1751, the estate was inherited by his uncle Sir Compton Domvile, 2nd Baronet. It remained with the Domvile family until the death in 1935 of Sir Compton Meade Domvile, 4th Baronet, when the estate passed to his nephew Sir Hugo Po√´, who assumed the surname Domvile. =Swiss Cottages= The Swiss Cottages that are still associated in memory with Santry are largely no longer extant. The cottages were built in 1840 by Lady Domville who, after a visit to Switzerland, decided to build 11 Swiss-style cottages for the farm workers and estate staff. Unfortunately 10 of the 11 cottages were demolished due to their dilapidation. While the last remaining cottage still stands in Santry, it is not in its original conception and the building was adapted into an office block in 1984 and today houses a pharmacy. Morton Stadium now stands on the site of what was the gardens at the rear of the house. The only contemporary reminder of the Swiss Cottages is found on the name of a local pub, ‚ÄòThe Swiss Cottage‚Äô. In 2019 The Swiss Cottage pub was demolished, and work commenced on a new apartment complex on the site.North Dublin locals in mourning after popular pub, The Swiss Cottage closes down ahead of redevelopment by Gavin O'Callaghan, Irish Mirror, June 4, 2019. =Residential housing estates= Santry is made up of numerous housing estates which are a mixture of private and social housing, with most estates being made up of the former. True to the town's roots many of their names start with 'Shan' such as Shanliss, Shanowen, Shanglas, Shanboley, Shanvarna and Shangan (The latter having been encroached upon by the growing area of neighbouring Ballymun due to its redevelopment). There are also the estates of Magenta, Lorcan, as well as more recent developments such as Aulden Grange, Woodlawn, Oak, Larchill, Knightswood and the extensive apartment complexes of Northwood to name a few. =Shopping and amenities= Besides several local shops, Santry benefits from having its own major shopping centre the 'Omni Park Shopping Centre' which also features a cinema, IMC Santry (previously called the Omniplex Cinema), and several restaurants. There is also a large retail park in Northwood called Gulliver's retail park. In addition Santry is home to the Crown Plaza hotel, several restaurants, multiple gymnasiums, a track and field stadium, a sports injury clinic, a go-karting/paint-balling arena, an AIB bank, an industrial estate, a skate park, several B&B;'s, several pubs, an outdoor 'Astro' soccer stadium and local primary and secondary schools. Santry is just a few minutes drive from Dublin Airport. The Santry Sports Clinic is located in Santry Demense and provides a wide range of mainly sports related orthopaedic therapy. Churches Santry is part of the Whitehall-Larkhill-Santry Roman Catholic parish and served by the Church of the Holy Child opened in 1944,Larkhill/Whitehall/Santry Dublin Diocese Website. and by Blessed Margaret Ball, ChurchThe Chapel of the Blessed Margaret Ball opened in 1994(named after one of the Dublin Martyrs).

Workers were paid in food and the land was provided by the Domville family of Santry Woods; it is now a nursing home. This had replaced an earlier St. Pappan's Catholic Church on Santry Avenue built in 1797). There is an old graveyard beside St. Pappan's and a Parish Hall. While Blessed Margaret's was being developed the Parish Hall was used by the Catholic community for weekly mass. At one point St. Pappan's Catholic Church in Ballymun shared seats with St. Pappan's Church of Ireland, and they moved the seats between the Churches between services.St. Pappan's Church Dublin Public Libraries A more recent development is the Dublin Christian Life Church, in schoolhouse lane, a Chinese Christian community.Devout Chinese to build their own church in Dublin by Colin Coyle, The Times, September 24, 2017.Dublin Christian Life Church Another new church is the Christian Fellowship Church, off coolock lane.Christian Fellowship Church Schools Santry is served by boys and girls National Schools in Larkhill, Gaelscoil Cholmcille, and secondary schools Margaret Aylward, Whitehall House, St. Aidan's C.B.S. and Plunket College.

The greyhound racing was operational from August 1945 until 1951 and the speedway operated from 1948 until 1951. Industrial estates Santry has long been the location of a number of business and industries, from Chrysler and the Talbot factory on Shanowen Road (which became the Garda Station), to IT companies and logistic service providers associated with nearby Dublin Airport. Current businesses based here include Kelloggs. * Airways Industrial Estate * Furry Park Industrial Estate * Santry Hall Industrial Estate * Shanowen Road Business Park * St John's Court Office Park * Woodford Business Park Transport Public transport comprises a number of bus routes, operated by Dublin Bus:List Bus Services 1 - From Santry to Sandymont 16 - From Ballinteer to Airport 17a - From Blanchardstown to Kilbarrack via Santry 27b - From Harristown to Eden Quay - turns away from Santry at the Santry Demesne junction 33 - From Balbriggan to Lower Abbey Street 41 - From Swords Manor to Lower Abbey Street 41b - From Rolestown to Lower Abbey Street 41c - From Swords Manor to Lower Abbey Street 104 - From Clontarf Road to DCU Ongoing budgetary cuts to Dublin Bus mean that many services are being cancelled, shortened, merged with other pre-existing services or reduced in frequency. The Metro North line of the planned Dublin Metro was predicted to begin operation in 2010. It was to pass through the nearby suburb of Ballymun with a planned stop near Northwood at the western end of Santry Demesne. As of January 2015, no evident construction or media announcement of Metro North can be seen, and most likely due to the economic downturn, Metro North will not be completed.

He was one of Germany's first modern realists and one of the most notable dramatists of the period. Biography His father, who was syndic of Eisfeld, died when he was twelve years old, and he was brought up amidst uncongenial conditions. He had devoted his leisure time to poetry and music, which unfitted him for the mercantile career planned for him. The attention of the Duke of Meiningen was directed to one of his musical compositions, an opera, Die K√∂hlerin (The Charcoal Burner), and Ludwig was enabled in 1839 to continue his musical studies under Felix Mendelssohn in Leipzig. But ill health and constitutional shyness caused him to give up a musical career and he turned exclusively to literary studies, and wrote several stories and dramas. Of the latter, Der Erbf√∂rster (The Hereditary Forester) (1850) attracted immediate attention as a masterly psychological study. It was followed by Die Makkab√§er (The Maccabees) (1852), in which the realistic method of Der Erbf√∂rster was transferred to an historical milieu, which allowed more brilliant coloring and a freer play of the imagination. With these tragedies, to which may be added Die Rechte des Herzens (The Rights of the Heart) and Das Fr√§ulein von Scuderi (The Lady of Scuderi), the comedy Hans Frey, and an unfinished tragedy on the subject of Agnes Bernauer, Ludwig ranks immediately after Christian Friedrich Hebbel as Germany's most notable dramatic poet at the middle of the 19th century. Meanwhile he had married and settled permanently in Dresden, where he turned his attention to fiction. He published a series of admirable stories of Thuringian life, characterized by the same attention to minute detail and careful psychological analysis as his dramas. Some of these include Die Heiteretei und ihr Widerspiel (1851), and Ludwig's masterpiece, the powerful novel, Zwischen Himmel und Erde (Between Sky and Earth) (1855). In his Shakespeare-Studien (not published until 1891) Ludwig showed himself a discriminating critic, with a fine insight into the hidden springs of the creative imagination. So great, however, was his enthusiasm for Shakespeare, that he was led to depreciate Friedrich Schiller in a way which found little favour among his countrymen. He died in Dresden in 1865. His detailed analyses and observations of Shakespearean plays were published posthumously.

The springs are home to several threatened or endangered species, including the Texas blind salamander, fountain darter, and Texas wild rice. The river is a popular recreational area, and is frequented for tubing, canoeing, swimming, and fishing.  Course  The river begins at San Marcos Springs, rising from the Edwards Aquifer into Spring Lake. Access to much of the headwaters is restricted because of the delicate ecosystem and numerous rare species. The upper river flows through San Marcos, and is a popular recreational area. It is joined by the Blanco River after four miles, and passes through Luling and Palmetto State Park. Near Gonzales, it flows into the Guadalupe River after a total of 75 miles (121 km). This course is the first section of the Texas Water Safari. The old Rio Vista Dam, now demolished: The area was transformed into three rapids, making it a very popular recreational area  History  The history and naming of the river is somewhat unclear. It may have been discovered by Alonso de Le√≥n's expedition in 1689, but some scholars believe they instead had found the Colorado or Navidad Rivers. The convention came to call the first sizable river beyond the Guadalupe, but at the time, the Comal River was often called the Guadalupe, and part of the Guadalupe often called San Yb√≥n. In 1808, the Spanish established San Marcos de Neve, just south of present-day San Marcos. They had friendly relations with the Tonkawa Indians, but the hostile Comanche tribe forced them to leave in 1812. In 1998 and 2015, the river was affected by severe flooding.  Events  San Marcos hosts many events on the San Marcos River. The Texas Water Safari event has run every year since 1963; it uses canoes powered only by human muscle. This event uses the San Marcos River and the Guadalupe River, spanning from Aquarena Springs in San Marcos to Seadrift, Texas, a total of 260 miles. This event is actually composed of many parts, including an information seminar, the safari race, a preliminary race, and another short race. Racers must take enough food and provisions to last them the distance of the race. The Texas Water Safari is billed as the \\"World's Toughest Boat Race\\" and runs annually on the second Saturday of June. Another event is the San Marcos River annual San Marcos River Clean-Up, which is an organized spring clean-up of the whole river. Volunteers can either clean debris around the river with the use of canoes, or cook food for the San Marcos River Clean-Up thank-you dinner that is provided for all volunteers. The clean-up is coordinated yearly by Tom Goynes, president of the Texas River Protection Association, and is usually the first Saturday of every March.  Wildlife  San Marcos has many different wildlife species, including endangered ones, that reside in the San Marcos River. Species are listed threatened or endangered based on declining numbers or loss of habitat. The Texas blind salamander and the San Marcos salamander are endangered species that are only found in certain section of the San Marcos River and the Edwards Aquifer. Other endangered species include the fountain darter and San Marcos gambusia, which reside in the San Marcos River. The fountain darter is characterized by the mottled brown body and dark markings that help it camouflage into the bottom of the San Marcos River banks. It has a growing population and flourishes in the San Marcos River. The San Marcos gambusia is characterized by prominent dark stripes along its body. Its population is unknown, as no samples have been collected since 1983, and is even considered to be extinct. Both fish require clear, clean, continually flowing water with a stable temperature. An endangered plant species specific to the San Marcos River is Texas wild rice. Only 230 clumps still remain on the river in two different populations, with one population being grown on the Texas State University campus. The San Marcos River is considered to be one of the most biologically diverse aquatic ecosystems known in the Southwestern United States. Consequently, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have designated the San Marcos Springs and Spring Lake critical habitat, so some parts of the river are privatized. Critical habitat refers to a particular geographical area that contains all of the physical, chemical and biological attributes needed for the continued success of an endangered plant or animal and that may require special efforts for their management and protection.  Restoration efforts  Much of the San Marcos River is protected by the Edwards Aquifer habitat conservation plan due to the wildlife that reside in or near the river. This plan was established in 2006 as an attempt between several Texas cities that use the many resources of the San Marcos River to manage aquatic habitats and water resources of the Comal and San Marcos springs. This plan helps manage control of non-native species, species stability, control of native species, sediment removal, reduction of contamination, and flow protection. Work on the San Marcos River banks are the main focus of the restoration projects in a large effort to protect the Edward Aquifer. Non-native plants are uprooted and new plants are planted to take their spots. Also, six new access points were to be added to the river in attempts to allow people to get in and out of the water without harm to the river banks. The city was to spend close to $1 million in this restoration attempt, to makes the river a more ideal habitat, while at the same time improving recreation.

Its northern terminus is at Route 19 in Cherryville; is southern terminus is at U.S. Route 67 five miles (8 km) east of Williamsville. The highway runs through the eastern part of the Ozarks and passes through two sections of the Mark Twain National Forest and near Johnson Shut-ins State Park and Taum Sauk Mountain. Lesterville and Annapolis, as well as Johnson Shut-ins State Park, were evacuated in 2005 following a reservoir failure at the Taum Sauk pumped storage plant. Route 49 is one of the original 1922 state highways. It only ran between Glover and Piedmont and was later extended. It is likely to be renumbered once Interstate 49 is completed to avoid confusion between the routes.

Phelan is known through the US mountain bike community for having developed WOMBATS (Women's Mountain Bike & Tea Society) for women interested more in socializing and enjoying nature. Her nickname of \\"Alice B. Toeclips\\" is a homage to Alice B. Toklas. Her bike Otto, was among the first aluminum frames raced, with drop bars off road, and her creative attire. Phelan is married to Wilderness Trail Bikes founder and component inventor Charlie Cunningham, the bicycle frame builder whose aluminum bike, \\"Otto,\\" Phelan raced unbeaten for six years. This bike was the first modern lightweight mountain bike, and its heat-treated sloping top tube aluminum frame held up for over nine consecutive seasons. The roller cam brakes, two chainrings (44-34), and custom-fabricated eleven-tooth rear cog gave a boost in technical riding. The bike also drew criticism from traditional framebuilders, who believed durable frames had to be made of steel. She is a charter inductee into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1988. In 2000, she was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame. Along with a dozen others, Phelan founded NORBA in 1982, and was a charter member of IMBA. Phelan founded the Women's Mountain Bike & Tea Society (WOMBATS) in 1987 to encourage women's and girls' participation, and in 1984 produced the sport's first off-road skills camps & clinics, known as \\"Fat Tire Finishing School\\". Her nickname of \\"Alice B. Toeclips\\" is a homage to Alice B. Toklas. Phelan once had the opportunity to ride with Independent Fabrication's racer Amy Crawford, a defining experience for both riders. Phelan was the first US mountain bike racer to race abroad (Man v. Horse, Wales). In 2004, she placed 8th overall in the Transportugal, a 1300 km offroad adventure race, where she was the only woman. Phelan is still invited to participate in offroad races both stateside and abroad. In summer 2009 she took part in a two-month vodka commercial called the 42 Below ride, a 4,200-mile crossing of the USA by road bike. Phelan appears in three documentary films: Full Cycle: A World Odyssey (1994), How to Cook Your Life (Doris Doerrie's film about Zen baker Edward Espe Brown, 2007), and Billy Savage's Klunkerz.A Film About Mountain Bikes, 2007 References External links *Her blog *Her new blog about food *Profile on the MTB Hall of Fame *WOMBAT's Home Page *2003 Interview on Metro Active *Bio on Hardi Hood *Photos from the 80s on mountainbikeroots.com *Some of Phelan's writing about biking on bikereader.com *\\"A brief autobiography\\" Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American female cyclists Category:American mountain bikers Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco ","title":"Jacquie Phelan"},{"id":"2433011","text":"The Irish damselfly or crescent bluet (Coenagrion lunulatum) is a damselfly found in northern Europe and Asia to north-eastern China;. It is common and widespread in northern Finland, scarce and local in the Netherlands and Ireland and rare elsewhere. One of its English name comes from the fact that it is found in Ireland but not in Britain. The alternative name, crescent bluet, refers to the shape of the markings on segment two of the male and its scientific name. Appearance This species is similar to the azure damselfly (C. puella), the variable damselfly (C. pulchellum) and the common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) with which it coexists. However, both the female and male are darker and shorter-bodied in comparison with other blue damselflies. The species can be identified using the following features: * In males the back of the abdomen is mostly black, whilst segments 8 and 9 are all blue. * In males the underside is bright green especially on the head and thorax (see side view) * The blue is of a darker shade than similar species * Females are dull green with black markings * In females the hind margin of the pronotum has a prominent raised point Status in Ireland C. lunulatum is uncommon in Ireland and is confined to the midlands and north. It is listed as Vulnerable on the Red List of Irish dragonflies. Adults have been recorded from the beginning of May (Co. Tyrone on 1 May 2011) to late July. It is found on sheltered mesotrophic lakes and large pools, fens and cutover bogs. It was first recorded in Ireland in Sligo in 1981. The total number of sites known in Ireland at the beginning of 2013 was 94 in 16 counties. The range encompasses most of the northern half of Ireland. The northernmost site is in County Donegal at Lough Napaste north of Milford and the southern limit is on the eastern edge of the Burren in Co Claree at Lough Skeardeen near Boston. The core of the range is in four counties ‚Äì Fermanagh, Leitrim, Monaghan and Tyrone. These hold three-quarters of the recorded sites (71). The other counties have five or fewer known sites. One of the places it has been successfully recorded and photographed is Brackagh Moss, in Armagh but it is probably extinct there. Eutrophication is suggested as the most serious threat to the species.

Life Kelly attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, at the foot of Mount Tamalpais.Tamalpais High School Alumni Association, Alumni Directory, 2002 During the late sixties and early seventies Kelly was a roadie for a San Francisco rock band, The Sons of Champlin. When the band broke up in 1977, Kelly turned his attention to his passion for bicycling and \\"klunker\\" bikes he and his friends were constructing from old frames and taking off-road. *In 1972 Kelly was a founding member and later president of Velo-Club Tamalpais, a bicycle club whose membership included most of the early Marin County mountain bike pioneers. *In 1976 he started promoting the Repack downhill race, the first great mountain bike event. In connection with his downhill racing efforts, he commissioned custom off-road bicycle frames from builders Craig Mitchell and Joe Breeze. These were among the first \\"mountain bikes\\" ever built. *In 1979 Kelly joined his former roommate Gary Fisher and framebuilder Tom Ritchey in a business venture called \\"MountainBikes,\\" the first place in the world people could buy a complete mountain bicycle, rather than putting it together themselves (Not to be confused with Specialized, who in 1981 sold the first PRODUCTION mountain bike, that could be bought in a bike shop and rolled away that same day). In 1982 Kelly sold his interest in the company to Fisher, who renamed it Fisher Mountain Bikes. *Also in 1979, Kelly began contributing articles to bicycle publications on the new and growing sport of mountain biking. *In 1980 Kelly and Denise Caramagno started the first mountain bike magazine: The Fat Tire Flyer. Until 1986 this was the only publication for mountain bikers. *In 1983 Kelly participated in the founding of the National Off-Road Bicycle Association, the first sanctioning body for mountain bike racing, and in collaboration with Tom Hillard, wrote the first set of rules for off-road bicycle racing. *Kelly is the author of a definitive history of the sport of mountain biking, Fat Tire Flyer: Repack and the Birth of Mountain Biking.

In late May of that year, a project to pave the entirety of Route 143 in oil aggregate treatment was announced. The work was completed by 1942. Route 143 was extended northwards further into the park by 1955, and Route N was paved in asphalt by 1958. A new gravel road, Route NN, connected Routes 143 and N by 1964.

Men and women usually sit on separate sides of the hall Darbar Sahib refers to the main hall within a Sikh gurdwara. This hall is where the holy text, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji (current and perpetual Guru of the Sikhs), is placed on a takhat or throne in a prominent central position. Darbar Sahib - Diwan Hall Darbar Sahib Worship takes place in the Diwan Hall (prayer hall). In the Diwan Hall, there are people playing worship hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib. The Guru Granth Sahib is the highest spiritual authority in Sikhism and is to be treated as though it is a living Guru. People visiting the Gurdwara sit on the floor often cross-legged, as pointing your feet towards an object or person, in this case, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji, may be mistaken as disrespectful according to cultural norms. It is also the traditional and optimal posture for deep meditation. Furthermore, sitting on the floor is seen as a symbol of equality among all people. Rather than some people standing, some people sitting on chairs and some people sitting on the floor, everybody sits on the floor to show that nobody is higher in status than anybody else. Traditionally, women and children, and men sit on opposite sides of the diwan hall. However, seating in a mixed pattern is in no way prohibited. The Guru Granth Sahib is placed on pillows, which have beautiful cloths draped over them, which are on a raised platform that has a canopy. The cloths, called romallas, cover the Guru Granth Sahib when it is not being read. This is at the front of the diwan hall. Also in the diwan hall, there is another platform where musicians (called the Ragis) sit and play their instruments while the congregation are singing hymns. Music is an important part of Sikh worship because it helps when people are singing hymns that are written in the Guru Granth Sahib. The hymns that are written in the Guru Granth Sahib are called Gurbani, which means: The words of the guru.

Most of their discography was released through the San Diego independent label Gravity Records. The label was responsible raising San Diego's profile in the underground music scene of the mid-1990s. The band, breaking up in 1994 and releasing one final studio album posthumously in 1995, are now considered to be one of the most influential bands of the early 1990s that shaped emo and post-hardcore music of the late 1990s and early 2000s. History The band first formed in 1992 by vocalist Aaron Montaigne, bassist Mac Mann, and drummer Ron Avila (who is also known by his nicknames \\"Ron Anarchy\\" and \\"Maxamillion Avila\\"). Avila and Montaigne originally knew each other from their previous band Heroin; Avila was the original drummer of Heroin, but left after the group played their first two shows. Montaigne joined the group to replace him. The trio would soon recruit guitarists Jeff Winterberg and Aaron Richards and, under this line up, released a split 7\\" with the band Candle and their debut 12\\" extended play The Lady Is A Cat, both in 1993 through Gravity Records. After this, Richards left the band as was subsequently replaced by Andy Ward, who was previously in the group Evergreen. With their line-up solidified, the group would release their second extended play In Love With Jetts in 1994, again through Gravity Records. During their run, the group embarked on 3 different tours within the United States. The first was a week-long tour of the West Coast in the spring of 1993. The second was a month-long tour of the U.S., spanning late June to Early July 1993. The third and final tour was originally supposed to be for 6 weeks from early June to late July 1994. However, van troubles and inter-band conflict ended the tour in early July with the band canceling many shows across the Northwest. Their last show ever took place in a truck trailer in Boulder, Colorado around July 6, 1994. In December 1994, the group were offered by Amalgamented Recording Corp to fly out to Los Angeles, California to record, which resulted in the group's final album, Gems Of Masochism, which was released posthumously in 1995. The album is noted for its gothic sound, utilizing synthesizers. According to Montaigne, it was ill-received by the punk scene when it was initially released. =Post-breakup= Since the group's break-up, members have gone on to work on other musical projects. Andy Ward and Ron Avila, for example, formed the Three One G supergroup Holy Molar. Aaron Montaigne would later form a heroin addiction by the late 1990s, but eventually sobered when he joined the US Army in the early 2000s. Jeff Winterberg would go on to do photography, and in 2011 he was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a rare form of cancer that typically affects children, with only two percent of case effecting adults. Style, Influences, and Legacy The band is typically seen as a vital part of both first wave emo music and the \\"San Diego sound\\", an early style of post-hardcore originating from San Diego that was popularized by bands such as Swing Kids and Heroin. The group's first three released were issued by Gravity Records, a label that is also considered to have played an important role in the \\"San Diego sound\\". The band's early recordings, such as The Lady Is A Cat, displayed a somewhat \\"basic\\" hardcore punk sound, while In Love With Jetts introduced a much more spastic, noisy style that the band would later be known for. The group's final album, Gems Of Masochism, introduced synthesizers and an overall gothic aesthetic, both musically and visually. The band has been described as post-hardcore, art punk, emo, post- punk, and no wave. The band has gone on to name many influences, including mid-late 1980s DC emo and hardcore bands such as Ignition and Rites of Spring. The Birthday Party was also a major early influence for the group, and the somewhat strange style of The Nation of Ulysses also inspired the group majorly. Vocalist Aaron Montaigne has also stated that the vocal style of Chris Thomsphon (of the late 1980s Washington, DC hardcore group Fury) shaped his own style of desperate, fearful vocals. Antioch Arrow are now considered a highly influential band for their time. At the Drive-In once stated how the group influenced them, as well as The Blood Brothers. The experimental noise rock band Racebannon has also described Antioch Arrow as an early influence.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922 as a member of the Labour Party. Moore was born in Lewisham, the son of Charles Frederick Moore and Martha Castle, and was educated at All Saints in Sydenham, in the southern suburbs of London, England. As a boy, he served in the Royal Navy. In 1904, he married Harriet Pink. Moore moved to Canada in 1910. He was a Signal Sergeant in the 44th Battalion of the C.E.F. in World War I, and was wounded twice. After the war, Moore served on a commission set up by the Manitoba government to investigate employment opportunities for veterans. After the work, he worked at the Fort Rouge yards of the Canadian National Railway. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election for the constituency of Springfield, east of Winnipeg. Moore defeated Farmer candidate Isaac Cook by 59 votes, and served with the opposition Labour parliamentary group for the next two years. It is not clear what role he played in the Labour Party's divisions of late 1920, though, in any event, he did not seek re-election in 1922. Moore served as president of the Manitoba command of the Great War Veterans Association and then was chairman of the Canadian Legion from its formation in 1925 until his death in 1950. In the 1927 provincial election, an \\"A.E. Moore\\" sought election in Winnipeg as an independent supporter of the pro-temperance \\"Moderation League\\". At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Moore finished eighteenth on the first count, and was eliminated on the tenth. It is likely that this \\"A.E.

It is the country's largest sports complex with a capacity of 41,143 seats. It is named after Hernando Siles Reyes, the 31st President of Bolivia (1926‚Äì1930). The stadium is located in the Miraflores borough of La Paz, at an altitude of 3,637 metres (11,932 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest professional stadiums in the world. The Stadium was opened in 1931 with a match between The Strongest and its classic rival, Universitario, with The Strongest winning 4‚Äì1. It is the home ground of three major Bolivian league football clubs, Club Bolivar, The Strongest and La Paz F.C. as well as several smaller top sides: Universitario de La Paz, Chaco Petrolero and Mariscal Braun. The stadium also hosts lower league clubs: Fraternidad Tigres and Academia de Balompi√© Boliviano. History The stadium has been the site of historic moments in Bolivian football history, including Bolivia's 2‚Äì0 defeat of Brazil in the CONMEBOL Group 2 1993 qualifiers for 1994 World Cup, Brazil's first defeat in 40 years of playing the qualifiers. Another such moment of this history occurred on April 1, 2009 when Bolivia defeated Argentina 6‚Äì1, inflicting the worst defeat for Argentina in 60 years. 6 months after, on October 11 (in the same qualifying group for 2010 World Cup), Bolivia defeated an underweight Brazil 2‚Äì1. FIFA altitude ban  Until May 2007, FIFA, football's international governing body, accepted the stadium as a World Cup Qualifying venue, despite protests from visiting teams that the altitude gave the Bolivian national team an unfair advantage against opponents who had only a few days to acclimatise before playing. On May 27, 2007, FIFA declared that no World Cup Qualifying matches could be played in stadiums above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level. Some, including Bolivian President Evo Morales and Diego Maradona, reacted by claiming the new measure discriminated primarily against high-altitude nations in Latin America, especially those in the Andes. The \\"Hernando Siles\\" became a symbol of the Bolivian struggle against FIFA's ban on games at altitude. After a month of campaigning against the ban, FIFA raised the altitude limit from 2500 meters to 3000 meters on June 27, 2007. The next day, FIFA also announced a special exemption for the Estadio Hernando Siles, allowing the stadium to continue holding World Cup qualifying matches. The ban was revoked in May 2008. During 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cup qualifiers together, Bolivia had fourteen home wins and ten home draws, and only two away draws and no away wins. In 2017, Neymar posted photos of Brazil players with oxygen masks before their 2018 World Cup qualifiers game in the stadium and commented that it is \\"inhumane\\" to play under those conditions. Events The American rock band Bon Jovi played a concert at the stadium on November 9, 1993 during I'll Sleep When I'm Dead Tour. It was the band¬¥s first concert in the country. Mexican pop band RBD kicked off their Gira del Adi√≥s World Tour at the stadium on November 1, 2008. Enrique Iglesias played a concert at the stadium on July 2, 2011 during Euphoria Tour.

It caters for boys from ages 11 to 18, providing GCSE and A Level and BTEC qualifications as part of its teaching programme. The school was founded by the Christian Brothers, and is coupled with St Anthony's Girls' Catholic Academy, its sister school which is located nearby. It is also twinned with St Joseph's Agricultural School In Blama, Sierra Leone.  History  Canon Smith, then parish priest of St Mary‚Äôs in Sunderland, founded St Mary's Grammar School at Bede Towers in 1928/29. The building on Burdon Road is a villa in Italianate style originally the home of Mayor John Moore. Records show the first schoolmaster, Mr J Goundry, was a layman. The Jesuits took over the running of the school in 1935 ‚Äì two years after taking on Ashbrooke Hall as a retreat for local Catholic men and renaming it Corby Hall. Ashbrooke Hall, in Ashbrooke Road, had originally been built for glassmaker James Hartley in 1864 by architect Thomas Moore, whose masterpiece was Monkwearmouth Station. It later became the home of the Short shipbuilding family, before being taken over by the Jesuits. The original Superior of the teaching staff, and of Corby Hall Retreat House, was Father SJ Whittaker. It was opened on 8 October 1933 by the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, Joseph Thorman and closed in 1973.Corby Hall, Sunderland from The Tablet. Retrieved 14 March 2014Jesuits Close Retreat House from Catholic Herald. Retrieved 14 March 2014 The school transferred from Bede Towers to The Briery in Ashbrooke Road in 1936 ‚Äì previously the home of Mr Craven of Craven Ropery. There was a pedestrian tunnel under the road to gardens opposite, which the school later used as a sports ground. The name was then changed to Corby Hall, to avoid confusion with another school. Further confusion arose, however, between Corby Hall and Corby Hall School, so that \\"an interchange of letters was necessary after each of the postman's rounds,\\" according to Jesuit archives. Just a year later, in 1937, the name of the school was changed yet again, to Sunderland Catholic College, and in 1939 it became Corby School. The dedication of both Corby School and Corby Hall recalled, according to the Jesuit archives, the historical association of Sunderland with Father Ralph Corby who was captured by Puritans in 1644 and hanged. The name Corby School lasted until 1948 when the Jesuits left and handed running of the school over to the Christian Brothers of Ireland. It was renamed as St Aidan's RC Grammar School and remained a grammar school until 1973, when a new school block and gymnasium building was completed on the opposite side of Ashbrooke Road and linked to the old school site by a tunnel. At this date the school was reclassified as a comprehensive school, although the last 'grammar school' pupils took their O-levels in 1975. St Aidan's retained the Briery building for use by the sixth form. Ashbrooke House was used as a retreat by the Brothers for many years, but was sold off in the 1970s and demolished to make way for flats. In April 2013, St Aidan's Catholic School was converted to an academy and renamed St Aidan's Catholic Academy. In 2016, an ex-pupil of St Aidan's school was paid ¬£17,000 compensation by the Congregation of Christian Brothers after claiming two members of the Christian Brothers abused him at school in the 1960s. Other ex-pupils have come forward and made similar claims. Houses and uniform St Aidan's has forms into which each year is divided. The forms, which form houses are: Aquin and Bede making Ashbrook House, Corby and Fisher making Corby House and More, David and Rice making Brookfield House. The school is split into two main buildings: the main school, which caters mainly for boys up to Year 11, and the Briery, which housed the Sixth Form until Simon Hodgson left, and the Sixth Form joined with sister school St Anthony's under one umbrella. Controversy In 2014, Ross Lorraine, a former St Aidan's alumnus was arrested for tweeting a malicious joke about the 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash.

Existing in numerous forms in many languages, the text is thought to be translated from an ancient Greek manuscript, now lost. Plot summary In most versions, the eponymous hero is hunted and persecuted after he reveals Antiochus of Antioch's incestuous relationship with his daughter. After many travels and adventures, in which Apollonius loses both his wife and his daughter and thinks them both dead, he is eventually reunited with his family through unlikely circumstances or intercession by gods. In some English versions Apollonius is shipwrecked and becomes a tutor to a princess who falls in love with him, and the good king gradually discovers his daughter's wishes. The major themes are the punishment of inappropriate lust--the incestuous king invariably comes to a bad end--and the ultimate rewards of love and fidelity. Origins (Latin and Greek?) The story is first mentioned in Latin by Venantius Fortunatus in his Carmina (Bk. vi. 8, 11. 5‚Äì6) during the late 6th century; it is conjectured, based on similarities with the Ephesian Tale of Xenophon of Ephesus and the presence of idioms awkward in Latin but typical in Greek, that the original was a Greek romance of the third century.Stuart Gillespie, Shakespeare's Books (2001) p. 204. Some fragments of Greek romance, however, point to the possibility of an even older date.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England, New York Burt Franklin, 1963, p. 170‚Äì171. The earliest manuscripts of the tale, in a Latin version, date from the 9th or 10th century but are from late antiquity. Thus they show an intersection of Greek and Roman as well as pre-Christian and Christian influences.Stelios Panayotakis, \\"Figuring the Body in The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre.\\" Overall, the work is classed with other ancient Greek romance novels.B. P. Reardon, editor, Collected Ancient Greek Novels, 2008. Some scholars hold that the riddles with which the king tests the hero in many versions may be a later addition:Laura A. Hibbard, op. cit., p. 171. ten derive from the c. fourth- century Latin riddle-collection attributed to Symphosius.Chauncey E. Finch, 'Codex Vat. Barb. Lat. 721 as a Source for the Riddles of Symphosius', Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, 98 (1967), 173-79 (p. 173); DOI: 10.2307/2935872; https://www.jstor.org/stable/2935872. Other scholars believe the incest story to have been a later addition as well, though others, including Elizabeth Archibald, see it as an integral thematic element of the tale.Elizabeth Archibald, Apollonius of Tyre: Medieval and Renaissance Themes and Variations, 1991. The most widespread Latin versions are those of Godfrey of Viterbo, who incorporated it into his Pantheon of 1185 as if it were actual history, Historia Apollonii regis Tyri and a version in the Gesta Romanorum.Laura A. Hibbard, op. cit., p. 164. Translations 'Fifty to a hundred versions' of the story are known from antiquity into the early modern period, mostly European, including texts in English, Dutch, German, Danish, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Greek, and Latin.Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 18. The earliest vernacular translation is an incomplete Old English prose text from the 11th century, sometimes called the first English novel. The existence of this unique text is unusual, as secular prose fiction from that time is extremely rare. The manuscript copy may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Archbishop Wulfstan's homilies.Goolden, Peter The Old English Apollonius of Tyre Oxford University Press 1958 xxxii-xxxiv Various versions of the tale were later written in most European languages. A notable English version is in the eighth book of John Gower's Confessio Amantis (1390), which uses it as an exemplum against lust. It is described as being based on Pantheon, but it contains many details that work does not but the old Historia does.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p165‚Äì6 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Its numerous vernacular versions, along with the Latin ones, attest to its popularity throughout the Middle Ages.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p165 New York Burt Franklin,1963 It appears in an old Danish ballad collected in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p168 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Robert Copland translated from the French the romance of Kynge Appolyne of Thyre (W. de Worde, 1510). Later versions and influence The story was retold in thirteenth-century Castilian as Libro de Apolonio. It is also a major inspiration of the chanson de geste Jordain de Blaivies. Robert Copland wrote an early 16th-century prose version. William Shakespeare and George Wilkins's play Pericles, Prince of Tyre was based in part on Gower's version, with the change of name probably inspired by Philip Sidney's Arcadia. Apollonius of Tyre was also a source for his plays Twelfth Night and The Comedy of Errors.

Bouillon is also available in granular, powdered, or liquid form. History Dehydrated meat stock, in the form of tablets, was known in the 17th century to English food writer Anne Blencowe, who died in 1718,Joan Thirsk, ‚ÄòBlencowe , Anne, Lady Blencowe (1656‚Äì1718)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2005; online edn, Jan 2007 accessed 17 Nov 2016 and elsewhere as early as 1735.Vincent La Chapelle, Le cuisinier moderne, as cited in Davis Various French cooks in the early 19th century (Lefesse, Massu√©, and Martin) tried to patent bouillon cubes and tablets, but were turned down for lack of originality.Jennifer Davis, Defining Culinary Authority: The Transformation of Cooking in France, 1650-1830, Louisiana State University Press, 2013, p. 154f Nicolas Appert also proposed such dehydrated bouillon in 1831. Portable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glue. It is a cousin of the glace de viande of French cooking. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish. Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 Household Cyclopedia, \\"exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes.\\"\\"Culinary Arts: Plain Cookery\\", Household Cyclopedia , 1881. In the mid-19th century, German chemist Justus von Liebig developed meat extract, but it was more expensive than bouillon cubes. The invention of the bouillon cube is also attributed to Auguste Escoffier, one of the most accomplished French chefs of his time, who also pioneered many other advances in food preservation, such as the canning of tomatoes and vegetables. Auguste Escoffier: Founder of Modern Cuisine; online https://www.iwfs.org/americas/wine-food--- friends-1/articles/auguste-escoffier--founder-of-modern-cuisine Industrially produced bouillon cubes were commercialized by Maggi in 1908, by Oxo in 1910, and by Knorr in 1912. By 1913, at least 10 brands were available, with salt contents of 59‚Äì72%. Ingredients The ingredients vary between manufacturers and may change from time to time. For a Telma stock cube they are: salt, hydrogenated fat, monosodium glutamate, flavor enhancers, and flavors. Maggi chicken bouillon cubes are manufactured from iodized salt, hydrogenated palm oil, wheat flour, flavor enhancers (monosodium glutamate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate), chicken fat, chicken meat, sugar, caramel, yeast extract, onion, spices (turmeric, white pepper, coriander), parsley. Production process Contrary to popular belief, stock cubes are not made by \\"drying out stock\\", but by mixing already dry ingredients into a paste. The ingredients are usually mixed in a container (batch mixing), left to mature, and then shaped into the cube form. Alternatively, they can be mixed directly into an extruder.

Settled in 1639, Southport center has been designated a local historic district since 1967, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as the Southport Historic District.  History  Trinity Church in Southport, photographed in 1966 The earliest recorded event in Southport's history was \\"The Great Swamp Fight\\" or \\"Fairfield Swamp Fight\\" of July 1637 (not to be confused with the later Great Swamp Fight of King Philip's War), an episode of the Pequot War in which English colonial forces led by John Mason and Roger Ludlow vanquished a band of about 80 to 100 Pequot Indians who had earlier fled from their home territory in the Mystic area and had taken refuge with about 200 Sasqua Indians who inhabited the area that is now Fairfield. The exact location of the battle is not known, but it is known to have been in the vicinity of Southport.http://www.fairfieldhs.org/explore- fairfield-history.php#great In the eighteenth century, Mill River village, a part of Fairfield, was a small hamlet of a few houses and a wharf at the mouth of Fairfield's Mill River. Farm products from the surrounding area were shipped from Mill River's small harbor to ports in New York and beyond.History of the Town of Fairfield, Connecticut By 1831 the village had changed its name to Southport and was a bustling commercial area with warehouses, churches, schools, stores and elegant houses. Before 1853, Southport had its own local government as a borough within the town of Fairfield. Southport became a leading coastal port on Long Island Sound, its ships carrying produce and goods back and forth to New York City. A measure of Southport's success is the fact that throughout the 1800s it possessed the only two banks in town. However, competition from steamboats and the railroad took its toll on prosperity. Resourceful shippers teamed with local farmers and businessmen to keep the port going; the Southport onion, a high quality onion, was developed and grown on Fairfield's hills and shipped in Southport market boats, keeping the harbor profitable until the end of the century. In the 1890s, 100,000 barrels of locally grown onions, carrots, potatoes, and other goods were shipped annually from Southport harbor. Today, much of the old village area is part of a town historic district, first established in 1967, where buildings from three centuries are protected for future generations. The boundaries of the town historic district are the railroad on the north; the Mill River and Southport Harbor on the south; Church Street; and Old South Road and Rose Hill Road on the west and east, respectively, including all properties on both sides of the roads.Gibbons v.

Created by David Michelinie and Bob Layton, the character made her first appearance in Iron Man #117 (December 1978). She is a supporting character of Iron Man. Publication history Bethany Cabe first appeared in Iron Man #117 (December 1978), and was created by David Michelinie and Bob Layton. The character subsequently appears in Iron Man #120‚Äì129 (March‚ÄìDecember 1979), #131 (February 1980), #133‚Äì135 (April‚ÄìJune 1980), #137‚Äì143 (August 1980 ‚Äì February 1981), and The All-New Iron Manual (2008). Bethany Cabe received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #1. Fictional character biography Bethany Cabe first appeared in the pages of Iron Man (1st series) #117 while Tony Stark (Iron Man) was attending a party for the Carnelian Embassy. Stark was trying to draw out an assassin known as Spymaster who attempted to kill him.Iron Man vol 1 #117 Stark was somewhat bored by the party, but his attention was quickly captured by the presence of a stunning redhead surrounded by potential suitors. Bethany shortly afterwards became Stark's girlfriend, turning up on various missions including a covert operation involving Roxxon Oil. It was after this incident that Bethany revealed to Stark that she was actually a bodyguard working for Cabe & McPherson Security Specialists with her best friend, Ling McPherson. Bethany accompanied Stark to Atlantic City where, as Iron Man, Stark came into conflict with the Melter, Blizzard, and Whiplash. During the battle, Iron Man was nearly overcome by the combined extreme temperatures from the Melter and Blizzard. However, Bethany stepped in to save him, providing Iron Man with a temporary distraction. With her expert skills in hand-to-hand combat, Bethany made short work of Whiplash. Unfortunately, this battle began a rift between Bethany and Stark's bodyguard, since Bethany believed that Iron Man should have been protecting Tony Stark instead of engaging in the battle. The rift came to a head when Iron Man's repulsor, under the control of Justin Hammer, blasted through the Carnelian ambassador, killing him instantly. With Iron Man wanted for murder, Bethany and Stark's relationship began to cool. Stark had already begun to drink heavily, and was on his first alcoholic binge. At Stark's darkest moment, Bethany returned and gave her love, support and friendship which was instrumental in helping Stark to overcome his addiction. It was also during this time that Bethany revealed that she had been previously married to a German diplomat named Alexander Von Tilburg who had a similar substance addiction with drugs. Bethany explained her regret and guilt at deserting Tilburg when he needed her the most, and how Tilburg appeared to die in a car accident. Bethany believed that if she had remained with him, he would still be alive today. Once Stark was off the bottle, Bethany resumed her relationship with Stark and became his closest confidante. However, Stark chose not to reveal that he was Iron Man at this time. Shortly afterwards, Iron Man came into conflict with Madame Masque once again. This time, Masque, together with the Spymaster, kidnapped Bethany. Masque wanted revenge on Stark and displayed her jealousy at Bethany's intimate relationship with him. Masque revealed that Stark and Iron Man were one and the same, believing that this would surprise Cabe. However, Bethany explained that she had already figured this secret out weeks ago. Masque, in a fit of rage, attempted to gun down Cabe, but was overcome in the process. This incident heralded the start of the long-term enmity between Bethany Cabe and Madame Masque. After a trip to the Caribbean where Bethany and Tony Stark finally seemed to find happiness, Bethany arrived home to news that her husband was still alive and being held somewhere in East Germany. Bethany was determined to rescue him, and became secretive and cagey towards Stark. Cabe eventually travelled to Germany where she was captured and held prisoner at a high-tech installation known as \\"Der Hand Von Himmel\\", or \\"Heaven's Hand\\".The correct German denomination would be \\"[Die] Hand vom Himmel\\" = \\"[The] Hand from Heaven\\" oder \\"Himmelshand\\" = \\"Heaven's Hand\\". Iron Man attempted to rescue her, but after assisting her to escape, was captured and held prisoner at the installation. Iron Man battled the Living Laser in order to escape, but once he had returned to the United States, Bethany informed him that she was returning to her husband and that therefore, her relationship with Stark was over. Stark went into another alcoholic binge shortly afterwards which was far more severe this time. Some years later, Bethany returned, seeking Stark's help, but was captured by Obadiah Stane who used mind transfer technology to switch Cabe's personality with that of Madame Masque's. Now, in Cabe's body, Masque attempted to kill Stark. However, she was thwarted by Bethany in Masque's body. Tony Stark managed to successfully transfer their personalities back to their rightful owners. Afterwards, Bethany decided to go back to Germany to officially end her relationship with Alex Von Tilburg. However, Tilburg was killed via a drug overdose. Bethany did not return for some time. Years later, after Stark's nervous system had been manipulated, forcing him to fake his own death, the giant robot Ultimo began attacking Los Angeles. Jim Rhodes (in the armored guise of War Machine) recruited a handful of Stark's former friends and employees to form a temporary group consisting solely of former incarnations of Iron Man, known as the Iron Legion. Bethany Cabe was among those recruited. She wore the armor which Stark had donned after the Armor Wars, and, along with War Machine and the other Iron Men, battled Ultimo. Bethany and Rhodes were the only Iron Men left standing before Tony Stark returned to destroy their enemy. After the battle, Stark recruited Bethany as his new Head of Security at Stark Enterprises. Bethany stayed on as Head of Security purely in a platonic capacity. However, shortly before the Crossing incident, Tony Stark renewed his relationship with Cabe once more. This relationship was not developed as Iron Man Volume 1 soon came to an end, and was not revived in subsequent volumes. Cabe reappeared as James Rhodes' benefactor in War Machine Vol. 2 #1. During this she wore a War Machine Armor similar to his and assisted Rhodes in his battles.War Machine Vol.2 #8 After several attempts at his employee's lives, Tony Stark hires her as head of security in his new company Stark Resilient.Invincible Iron Man #503 At the behest of Tony Stark, Cabe was rehired by Pepper Potts to beef up the security protocols for the fledgling startup Stark Resilient and its employees. Distrusting Cabe, Potts attempted to undermine her position several times, lying about the lack of pay (to discourage her from taking the job) and withholding potential information about a mole within the company. Cabe retaliated by secretly capturing video of Pepper, dressed in her personal \\"Rescue\\" armor, crying during the Marvel- wide Fear Itself crossover event, then leaking the footage to shareholders. Cabe later defended Stark Resilient against an attack by the mole, who was revealed to be Spymaster.  Other versions  * In Iron Man: The End, a one- shot special set in an alternate future, Tony Stark ultimately married Bethany Cabe. In their old age, they retired to a Stark-designed space station orbiting Earth. * In the MAX comics series US War Machine, Bethany is Stark's bodyguard and lover, as well as a wearer of one of the Stark-designed armors.

Pedro, Duke of Coimbra KG (; ), (9 December 1392 ‚Äì 20 May 1449) was a Portuguese infante (prince) of the House of Aviz, son of King John I of Portugal and his wife Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt. In Portugal, he is better known as Infante D. Pedro das Sete Partidas [do Mundo], \\"of the Seven Parts [of the World]\\" because of his travels. Possibly the best- travelled prince of his time, he was regent between 1439 and 1448. He was also 1st Lord of Montemor-o-Velho, Aveiro, Tent√∫gal, Cernache, Pereira, Condeixa and Lous√£.  Early life  Infante Peter, Regent of the Kingdom of Portugal. From the time he was born, Peter was one of John I's favourite sons. Along with his siblings, he received an exceptional education rarely seen in those times for the children of royalty. Close to his brothers Edward, the future king of Portugal, and John, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, Peter grew up in a calm environment free of intrigues. On 14 August 1415, he accompanied his father and brothers Edward and Henry for the Battle of Ceuta in Morocco. His mother had died the previous month, giving each of her sons on her deathbed an arming sword she had ordered forged for them. Peter refused to be knighted before showing valour in battle, and he was knighted along with his brothers the following day; he was also created Duke of Coimbra. His younger brother Henry was made Duke of Viseu. These were the first dukedoms created in Portugal. On finishing a translation of Seneca's De Beneficiis in 1418, he initiated extensive travels throughout Europe, which would keep him away from Portugal for the next ten years. After meeting with John II of Castile in Valladolid, he continued to Hungary, where he met with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, and entered his service. He fought with the Imperial armies against the Turks and in the Hussite Wars in Bohemia and was awarded the march of Treviso in Northern Italy in 1422. In 1424 he left the Holy Roman Empire, meeting first with Murad II, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, on the island of Patmos, and then continuing to Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire; the hopeless position of the city against the Ottoman onslaught did not fail to impress him. From Constantinople he travelled to the Holy Land via Alexandria and Cairo.  European travels  In 1425, Peter travelled to France and England and visited the universities of Paris and Oxford before arriving in Flanders in 1426, where he spent the next two years at the Burgundian court. After the death of the second wife of Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1425, Peter recommended his sister Isabella to him as a wife. Philip sent a delegation to Portugal in 1428‚Äì29 that included Jan van Eyck, who painted two portraits of the Infanta. Philip and Isabella eventually married on 7 January 1430, and one of their sons became Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy. In 1427, Peter wrote a famous letter to his older brother, later King Edward, on \\"the proper administration of the kingdoms\\", from Bruges. Later that year, King Henry VI of England (his first cousin once removed) made him a Knight of the Garter (as were already his father and older brother Edward). In 1428, Peter visited his marquisate of Treviso and the nearby Republic of Venice, where he was presented with a copy of the book of Marco Polo by the doge. He later gave that book, as well as maps of the Venetian trade routes in the Orient, to his younger brother Prince Henry the Navigator. One of the maps was created by the famous Venetian cartographer Albertinus de Virga in 1411 and possibly shows North America before it was officially discovered. This map was found in the Alcoba√ßa Monastery which was the main library of the Portuguese Royal family. From Venice he traveled to Rome, where he was received by Pope Martin V, and from there he continued to Barcelona, where he negotiated the marriage of his brother Edward with Eleanor of Aragon as well as his own future marriage with Isabella of Urgell, before finally returning to Portugal. Monument of the Discoveries, in Lisbon, Portugal. In 1433, he completed his famous six-volume work, the Tratado da Virtuosa Benfeitoria.  Regent  When Peter's brother King Edward I of Portugal died in 1438, Peter's nephew Afonso V ascended the throne as an infant. At first, the choice for regent was the Queen mother Eleanor of Aragon. This choice was not popular among many Portuguese, because Eleanor was Aragonese. In a meeting of the Portuguese Cortes summoned by Peter's brother John, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, Peter was appointed regent of the kingdom during the minority of his nephew Afonso V, a choice that pleased both the people and the fast- growing bourgeoisie. Inside the Portuguese aristocracy, however, especially among nobles around Peter's half-brother Afonso, Count of Barcelos, Eleanor of Aragon was preferred, and there were doubts about Peter's political ability. A \\"war of influences\\" started, and a few years later, Afonso of Barcelos managed to become young King Afonso V's favourite uncle. In 1443, in a gesture of reconciliation, Peter created his half-brother Afonso Duke of Braganza, and relations between the two seemed to return to normality. But, in 1445, the new duke of Braganza took offence because Isabella of Coimbra, Peter's daughter was the choice for Afonso V's wife, and not one of his granddaughters. Indifferent to the intrigues, Peter continued his regency and the country prospered under his influence. It is during this period that the first subsidies for the exploration of the Atlantic Ocean were implemented under the auspices of Peter's brother Henry the Navigator.  Alleged Rebellion  On 9 June 1448, Afonso V came of age and Peter returned control of the country to the king. Influenced by Afonso, the Duke of Braganza, Afonso V nullified all of Peter's edicts, including the ones that concentrated power in the figure of the king. The following year, under accusations that years later would prove false, Afonso V declared Peter a rebel. The situation became unsustainable and a civil war began. It did not last long, because Peter died on 20 May 1449 during the Battle of Alfarrobeira, near Alverca. The exact conditions of his death are debatable: some say it was in combat, while others say he was assassinated by one of his own men. With the death of Peter, Portugal fell under control of Afonso, Duke of Braganza, with a growing influence over the destiny of the country. However, Peter's regency would never be forgotten, and Peter was cited many times by his grandson King John II of Portugal as his main influence. The cruel persecution of the Braganzas by John II was perhaps the response to the conspiracies that caused the fall of one of the major princes of the √çnclita Gera√ß√£o.  Marriage and issue  The Duke of Coimbra's arms. In 1429 Peter married Isabella of Urgell, daughter of James II, Count of Urgell, and candidate to the throne of the Crown of Aragon at the Compromise of Caspe. The couple had the following children: * Infante Peter (1429‚Äì1466), Constable of Portugal, Count of Barcelona and disputed King of Aragon. * Infante John (1431‚Äì1457), married Charlotte of Lusignan, heiress of Cyprus, in 1456.

Murry was the first manager of the Beach Boys; father of Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; and uncle of Mike Love. The intention of Sea of Tunes was to publish and promote the songs written primarily by Brian. Sale to Irving Almo Music After the Beach Boys dismissed Murry Wilson as their manager in 1964, he continued to serve as their publisher. In July 1965, he sent a letter to Brian requesting that he be officially granted sole ownership of the company, per a verbal agreement they had reached in 1962. According to historian Keith Badman, \\"Brian allowed Murry to take total control to stop his father's continual hassling on the matter.\\" In May 1969, Brian told the music press that the group's funds were depleted to the point that they were considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year, which Disc & Music Echo called \\"stunning news\\" and a \\"tremendous shock on the American pop scene\\". In August (or November), Murry sold Sea of Tunes to Irving Almo Music for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ), believing the catalog's value had peaked. Brian, according to his wife Marilyn Wilson, was devastated by the sale. Mike Love wrote, in his 2016 memoir, that the group signed away their rights to the songs under duress, and that in the late 1980s, it was discovered that the exchange was part of an elaborate plan orchestrated over two years by Abe Somer, the Beach Boys' lawyer. Somer concealed the fact that he was also Irving Music's lawyer, marking a conflict of interest. Over the years, the catalog would generate more than $100 million in publishing royalties, none of which Murry or the band members ever received. By 1994, the catalog was estimated to be worth $40 million ($ in ). In the early 1990s, years after Murry's passing, Brian claimed fraud and sued for the return of his song copyrights. The suit suggested that Brian's signature may have been forged, \\"plus malpractice, misrepresentations, suppression of facts, breach of contract and conflicts of interest,\\" making the sale illegal. While he failed to recover them in court, he was awarded $25 million in damages, including unpaid and underpaid royalties. Mike Love credits Mike Love alleged that he was owed credit to 79 Beach Boys songs. Love explained that Murry never credited him for many of the songs he had co-written with Brian, and therefore, he had also lost out on royalties. He said he \\"didn't know how badly I had been abused until I was deposed in Brian's pursuit of his claims against Irving Almo and Mitchell Silverburg and Nutt, which was the attorney representing the Beach Boys and Irving Almo. An inherent conflict of interest there.\\" Love hoped that \\"we don't have to go to trial because it's going to destroy Brian. He's going to be destroyed in depositions, first of all, let alone getting him in court.\\" They were unable to come up with a settlement, and so Love filed suit against Wilson in 1992. After an eight-week-long trial and eight days of deliberation, on December 12, 1994, Love won the case. The jury ruled that Love and Wilson were partners, that Wilson or his agents concealed material facts with the intention of defrauding Love, and that they engaged in promissory fraud with respect to publishing credits and royalties, and that Love was owed the 35 songs disputed. Love later called it \\"almost certainly the largest case of fraud in music history\\".

It is located on the north bank of the Jump River, from which the hamlet takes its name.Jump River: Origin of Place Name As of the 2010 census, its population was 52. History The first settlers in the Jump River area were Barney and Gertrude Broeder, who arrived in 1892 from Thorp, thirty miles to the south. They built a log home a mile upstream from the current village, at what is now called \\"the swimming hole.\\" Starting in 1897 Barney ran a post office from his house under the name Broederville. Other settlers joined the Broeders in the area through the 1890s. A sawmill was added, a school was built nearby and in 1900 the \\"Black Bridge\\" was completed, crossing the river at Broederville.Nagel, Paul. I Remember; I Remember: History and Lore of Jump River Wisconsin, 1986. The remains of its concrete abutment can still be seen on the east bank above the swimming hole. Until 1904, the settlers of Broederville reached the outside world by foot or horse through forest and swamp. The nearest contact with the outside was the railroad at Ingram, thirteen miles to the north. But in 1904 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway pushed up through the forest from Stanley to the south, crossing the Jump River where the town hall now stands. Within a few years, the businesses all moved a mile downstream to the railroad. In 1907, the village of \\"Jump River\\" was platted at its current location, where the railroad crossed the river. The streets lay as they do now. The railroad had put up some buildings, including a depot. C.J. Boeckler built a hotel called the \\"Jump River House\\" and he moved his sawmill and post office from Broederville to the new town site. The Ladies' Aid Society built a hall which has been used over the years by the Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the Baptists, the VFW, Boy Scouts, 4-H, and for town meetings, elections, and many other purposes. More hotels and stores and sawmills were built, saloons and garages, a blacksmith shop, a feed store, a cheese factory, and shanties and houses. At times the town had a veterinarian, a dentist, a doctor, and a jeweler. Much of this growth was driven by logging. The S.M.&P.; Railway was primarily a logging railroad, hauling logs out to sawmills at Stanley and Owen. When the timber was exhausted, little freight remained. Rail passengers also declined as roads improved. The S.M.&P.; shut down in 1933. Gradually the hotels, saloons, and services thinned, but farming had taken hold in the cutover land and Jump River shifted to serving the surrounding farmers. Formal education was done in a half-dozen scattered one-room elementary schools until 1956. In that year the three-classroom Jump River Elementary School was built east of town, and the little country schools closed. The new school operated for about forty years, then closed in another consolidation. Since then local students have been bussed to Gilman. In 1938, local leaders formed the Jump River Electric Cooperative, with financial support from the Rural Electrification Administration. The co-op initially provided electricity to 179 members with average consumption at 29 kilowatt hours per month. By 1944 the service area had grown and the office was moved from Jump River to Ladysmith. Though Ladysmith was more convenient, some in Jump River opposed the move, and it was begun under cover of night. Today this co-op begun by Jump River locals provides electricity, cable TV, and Internet services from Gilman to Hayward. In 2011, Jump River is smaller, but alive. The grocery store has closed, but there is still a meat locker. Three bars remain - one also a restaurant. People worship at St. Michael's Catholic church and Christ's Community Church. The fire department protects the community and homes in the surrounding countryside. In that countryside are family farms - dairy, beef, and a few Christmas tree farms. Some people work in logging and trucking and some commute to jobs in farther places like Medford and Ladysmith. Olynick Concrete is the largest local industry. The Jump River Town Hall hosts weddings and reunions. The Fourth of July is the big event of the year, with a parade, a tractor pull, a horseshoe tournament, and evening fireworks.

It was formed in 1934 by the merger of the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) with the Evangelical Synod of North America (ESNA). A minority within the RCUS remained out of the merger in order to continue the name Reformed Church in the United States. In 1957, the Evangelical and Reformed Church merged with the majority of the Congregational Christian Churches (CC) to form the United Church of Christ (UCC). History =Origins= Both the Reformed Church and Evangelical Synod originated in the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Almost all their churches in America were established by immigrants from Germany and Switzerland. In 1934, both bodies united to form the Evangelical and Reformed Church. =Reformed Church in the United States= The Reformed Church in the United States, long known as the German Reformed Church, organized its first synod in 1747 and adopted a constitution in 1793. Later, in the 1910s, a small group of immigrant Hungarian Reformed congregations joined the RCUS as a separate judicatory, the Magyar Synod. The Reformed tradition centered in the state of Pennsylvania, particularly the eastern and central counties of that state, and extended westward toward Ohio and Indiana and southward toward Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina in the first generation of immigration. Early Reformed adherents settled alongside Lutheran, Schwarzenau Brethren/German Baptists, and sometimes Anabaptist/Mennonite neighbors. Some Reformed congregations in Pennsylvania and North Carolina formed union churches with Lutherans, sharing the same building but operating as separate entities, although they frequently shared Sunday Schools and occasionally ministers. Up until the early 19th century, the Reformed churches ministered to German immigrants with a broadly Calvinist theology and plain liturgy. However, revivals, inspired by Anglo- Saxon Protestant churches during the Great Awakenings of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influenced the development of the Reformed churches, especially in frontier regions. Some of the more radical practitioners of revivalism and/or pietism defected to Brethren bodies; still others formed the Churches of God, General Conference, a conservative, doctrinally Arminian group. A backlash set in, however, against revivals in the form of the Mercersburg Theology movement. Named for the Pennsylvania town where the Reformed seminary was located in the mid-19th century, scholarly and ministerial advocates of this position sought to reclaim an older, European sense of the church as a holy society that understood itself as organically related to Christ. This implied a recovery of early Protestant liturgies and a renewed emphasis upon the rite of Holy Communion, somewhat akin to the Tractarian or Anglo-Catholic movement in Anglicanism but within a Reformation vein. Some leaders, however, saw this platform as an attempt to impose heretical Catholic practice and understandings in a Protestant setting. This group, centered in southeastern Pennsylvania in close proximity to a large Catholic population in Philadelphia and thus motivated by Anti-Catholicism, objected strenuously to the Mercersburg reforms, going so far as to establish a separate seminary now known as Ursinus College. After temporarily causing the Ohio Synod to withdraw from the church, tensions mounted until compromises were worked out and parishes of either low or high church persuasion were allowed to practice their preferences peacefully. A later group of Germans who had come from the Russian empire, settling in the late 19th century, took root in Wisconsin and spread westward across the Great Plains region; this group spoke German for several generations after the Pennsylvania Dutch had thoroughly Americanized themselves, theologically as well as linguistically. These immigrants did not participate in the Mercersburg/Ursinus struggle; their theological persuasion was decidedly confessionalist, holding to a fairly strict interpretation of the Heidelberg Catechism. So strong were the convictions of some that a few churches in that group, most of which were in South Dakota, defected immediately prior to the 1934 merger, influenced by such strict confessionalism, a belief in biblical inerrancy, and a fear of losing their Reformed roots. That group retained the name Reformed Church in the United States. This schism aside, by the time of the merger talks, the RCUS had mostly joined the American Protestant mainline, sending missionaries overseas and operating health and welfare institutions (i.e., hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes) throughout much of the United States. Further, the Reformed did some work among Native Americans in Wisconsin. The RCUS' constituency composed slightly over half of the membership of the new denomination in 1934. =Evangelical Synod of North America= The Evangelical Synod of North America (not to be confused with the Evangelical Church, later part of the Evangelical United Brethren Church) was founded in 1840 at Gravois Settlement, Missouri, by a union of Reformed and Lutheran Christians in a manner similar to the creation of the Prussian Union in the early 19th century. In its early years, this union was known as the German Evangelical Church Association of the West. The epicenter of the component Evangelical tradition was (and is to this day, within the UCC) Saint Louis, Missouri, with a particularly heavy concentration of parishes within a 75-mile radius, in Missouri and Illinois. Elsewhere, Evangelicals tended to settle in large cities of the Midwest, including Cincinnati, Louisville, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Chicago. Rural Evangelical strongholds included southwestern Indiana, southern Michigan and Iowa. In the Southern United States, the ESNA was found primarily in central Texas and New Orleans. These concentrations of German settlement also witnessed a large influx of more confessionally-oriented Lutherans, who formed the current-day Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in opposition to the syncretism they believed the Evangelicals represented. Although their faith was chiefly the product of a forced union by the government in Prussia, the Evangelicals by conviction wished to minimize the centuries-old points of contention between Lutheran and Reformed doctrine and practice. This attitude of moderation was enabled in large measure by the rise of pietism, which stressed a more emotional, less rationalistic approach to the teachings of the Bible, thus disinclining scholars and pastors toward technicalities or polemics. Many Evangelical parishes were founded by pastors trained in interdenominational missionary societies such as the St. Chrischona Pilgrim Mission in Basel, Switzerland, in the early 19th century; they immigrated to the United States to assist settlers fleeing Prussian militarism. Even to a greater degree than the Reformed, the Evangelicals became most noted among American Protestants for their establishment and staunch support of hospitals, orphanages, and homes for the elderly. Probably most similar in ethos (among English-speaking Protestant groups) to the Methodists, pastors emphasized pietist preaching and catechizing young people for the rite of confirmation, a rite still cherished highly to this day by congregations deriving from ESNA roots. Reflecting a later generation of immigration, the German language persisted for several generations in most congregations before such services were gradually phased out in the era between the World Wars, due in part to anti-German sentiment among some Americans. In 1919, they began missionary efforts in Honduras, establishing what is now called the Evangelical and Reformed Church in Honduras . In terms of governance, the Evangelicals most resembled American Lutheranism of the time, with high regard for the pastor's authority but essentially congregational in structure, with a lay council handling temporal matters such as property and benevolences. =Merger with Congregational Christian Churches= In 1957, the Evangelical and Reformed Church joined with the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches to form the UCC. The Rev. James Wagner was the last president of the denomination. Upon the union on June 25 of that year, he became, along with former Congregational Christian general minister Fred Hoskins, a co-president of the UCC. He and Hoskins held these positions until 1961, when the UCC constitution was ratified by the Evangelical and Reformed synods and the requisite percentage of CC congregations. About 40 percent of the members in the new denomination were members of the E&R; Church. Organization and theology The Evangelical and Reformed Church was generally presbyterian in organization, although it allowed for a great deal of local congregational decision-making than more typical Reformed bodies such as Presbyterianism or the Reformed Church in America did. The church organized into some 30 or so regional synods, culminating in a national General Synod that met annually. The church used several creeds: the Reformed Heidelberg Catechism, Martin Luther's catechisms, and the early Lutheran Augsburg Confession; Evangelical and Reformed leaders allowed great latitude in interpretation. In the main, Evangelical and Reformed congregations emphasized piety and service rather than legalistic soteriology or orthodox dogma. Styles of worship ranged from revivalism (especially in Ohio and North Carolina) to a Lutheran-like liturgicism (the Mercersburg Movement found primarily in central Pennsylvania parishes). Generally speaking, the theological outlook of most ministers was largely accepting of liberal trends in Protestant doctrine and higher biblical criticism, although some pockets of conservative revivalistic pietism and confessionalist Calvinism could be found. Educational institutions As with most Protestant denominations, the Evangelical and Reformed church maintained educational institutions and foreign missions. Affiliated educational institutions included the Lancaster Theological Seminary, Franklin and Marshall College, Cedar Crest College, and Ursinus College in Pennsylvania, Elmhurst College in Illinois, Hood College in Maryland, Catawba College in North Carolina Eden Theological Seminary in Missouri, and Heidelberg College in Ohio. An Evangelical and Reformed seminary, Mission House, previously located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, joined with the school of theology of South Dakota's Yankton College (a Congregational Christian institution) to form the United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities in the early 1960s. The seminary set up operations in New Brighton, Minnesota, outside St. Paul. In the early 1930s Central Seminary, a previous merger of Ursinus and Heidelberg Seminaries, was merged with Eden Seminary. In 1946, in cooperation with three other denominations, it formed the United Andean Indian Mission, an agency that sent missionaries to Ecuador.

Writing  Ms. White's first book, Friends for Life (1983) was published while she was a senior at Tufts University. Ms. White grew up in Narragansett, Rhode Island. Many of her fiction novels feature characters who reside in Boston or are from Boston and are fans of the Boston Red Sox (as Ms. White is). White now resides in New York City. In addition to her fiction novels, Ms. White has written both sports biographies and historical fiction/biography books. She wrote four stories about the Echo Company in the midst of the Vietnam War under the pseudonym Zack Emerson. White got the name Zack from the name of her shepherd dog. She has also written the Santa Paws series under the pseudonym Nicolas Edwards. The young adult characters in Ms. White's novels are realistic people who struggle with very difficult lives‚Äîwhether those lives include war, murder, kidnapping, or some other trouble. The focus of all of her books is on overcoming the difficulties and surviving as a better person. None of her characters' live what could be classified an \\"ordinary\\" life, but all are relatable to an \\"ordinary\\" person. Elements of White's stories are connected within her works. For example, the character Trudy (President's Daughter series) is from Brighton, the section of Boston where Molly and Patrick (Where Have All the Flowers Gone?) live. Perhaps the most intricate cross-work involvement occurs with the character Susan McAllister/Dowd. In the final book of the President's Daughter series, Meg's JA at Williams College is Susan, whose 'life'is chronicled in Friends For Life, and Life Without Friends. Another example of these connections is the character of nurse Rebecca Phillips from The Echo Company series, who was romantically connected to an army grunt named Michael Jennings. Rebecca's future is hinted at in both \\"All Emergencies, Ring Super\\" and the Santa Paws series when a \\"Dr. Jennings\\" is mentioned.

Because of England's ever increasing voyages to the New World, Spain became concerned by English intrusions into her territories, and planned to explore the north Atlantic coast in order to take possession of it. Juan de Dornelos was placed in command of an expedition in 1500 which never did happen as the expedition was never put to sea. After the failed attempt in 1500, Agramonte, a sailor and native of Lleida, signed a contract with the daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon on October 29, 1511 to lead an expedition of discovery and exploration to Terra Nova in the years following the voyages of John Cabot. The expedition, which was to comprise two ships, had orders not to land on soil under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Portugal. It has been speculated that this expedition also did not take place. The fact that these expeditions were contemplated furthers the notion that the shores of Newfoundland had previously been visited by the Bretons and that a part of the Newfoundland territory had been discovered by Portugal.

The VFT is a relatively recent development. Most asynchronous grid inter-ties use high-voltage direct current converters, while synchronous grid inter-ties are connected by lines and \\"ordinary\\" transformers, but without the ability to control power flow between the systems. It can be thought of as a very high power synchro, or a rotary converter acting as a frequency changer, which is more efficient than a motor‚Äìgenerator of the same rating. Construction and operation A variable-frequency transformer is a doubly fed electric machine resembling a vertical shaft hydroelectric generator with a three-phase wound rotor, connected by slip rings to one external power circuit. The stator is connected to the other. With no applied torque, the shaft rotates due to the difference in frequency between the networks connected to the rotor and stator. A direct-current torque motor is mounted on the same shaft; changing the direction of torque applied to the shaft changes the direction of power flow. The variable-frequency transformer behaves as a continuously adjustable phase-shifting transformer. It allows control of the power flow between two networks. Unlike power electronics solutions such as back-to-back HVDC, the variable frequency transformer does not demand harmonic filters and reactive power compensation. Limitations of the concept are the current-carrying capacity of the slip rings for the rotor winding. Projects Five small variable-frequency transformer with a total power rate of 25 MVA were in use at Neuhof Substation, Bad Sachsa, Germany for coupling power grids of former East and West Germany between 1985 and 1990. Langlois Substation in Qu√©bec, Canada () installed a 100 MW variable-frequency transformer in 2004 to connect the asynchronous grids in Qu√©bec and the northeastern United States. This was the first large scale, commercial variable frequency transformer, and was installed at Hydro-Qu√©bec Langlois substation and is located electrically near sixteen hydro generators at Les C√®dres, Quebec and thirty-six more hydro generators at Beauharnois, Quebec. The operating experience since April 2004 has demonstrated the VFT‚Äôs inherent compatibility with the nearby generators Marchen, P.E, Marczewski, J.J, D'Aquila, R, Hassink, P., Roedel, J.H. and Bodo, R.L.

It connects the power systems of ERCOT (in the United States) to CFE (in Mexico). (See The Laredo VFT Project.) Smaller VFTs are used in large land-based wind turbines, so that the turbine rotation speed can vary while connected to an electric power distribution grid. Linden VFT General Electric installed a 3 √ó 100 MW VFT substation in Linden, New Jersey, in the United States in 2009. It connects the power systems of PJM & New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). This installation is in parallel with three existing phase-shifting transformers to regulate synchronous power flow. Economics of energy trading VFTs provide the technical feasibility to flow power in both directions between two grids, permitting power exchanges that were previously impossible. Energy in a grid with lower costs can be transmitted to a grid with higher costs (higher demand), with energy trading. Power capacity is sold by providers. Transmission scheduling rights (TSRs) are auctioned by the transmission line owners. Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) are a financial instrument used to balance energy congestion and demand costs.

Airay was born at Kentmere, near Kendal, Westmorland. His date of birth is uncertain. His father was William Airay, a favored servant of Bernard Gilpin, \\"the apostle of the North\\". Gilpin generously agreed to send Henry and his brother Evan (or Ewan) to Gilpin's own endowed school, where they were educated \\"in grammatical learning,\\" and were in attendance at Oxford when Gilpin died. From Wood's Athenae Oxonienses we glean the details of Airay's college attendance: His transference to Queen's is perhaps explained by its having been Gilpin's college, and by his Westmorland origin giving him a claim on Eaglesfield's foundation. He graduated B.A. on 19 June 1583, M.A. on 15 June 1586, B.D. in 1594 and D.D. on 17 June 1600 ‚Äî all in Queen's College. \\"About the time he was master\\" (1586) \\"he entered holy orders, and became a frequent and zealous preacher in the university.\\" His Commentary on the Epistle to the Philippians (1618, reprinted 1864) is a specimen of his preaching before his college, and of his fiery denunciation of Roman Catholicism and his fearless enunciation of that Calvinism which Oxford in common with all England then prized. In 1598 he was chosen provost of his college, and in 1606 was named vice-chancellor of the university. In the discharge of his vice-chancellor's duties he came into conflict with Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was beginning to manifest his antagonism to Calvinism. Airay was also rector of Otmore (or Otmoor), near Oxford, a living which involved him in a trying but successful litigation, whereof later incumbents reaped the benefit. He died on 6 October 1616, and was buried in the Queen's Chapel. His character as a man, preacher, divine, and as an important ruler in the university, will be found portrayed in the Epistle by Christopher Potter, prefixed to the Commentary.

Scale 660 feet to One Inch. [1895] Found on http://geo- outaouais.blogspot.com/2014/06/ The falls are about wide and drop . The area around the falls was once heavily industrialized, especially in the 19th century, driving growth of the surrounding cities. The \\"Chaudi√®re\\" name was given to the falls by Samuel de Champlain, an early French explorer who noted in a 1613 journal entry that the Indigenous word for the falls was Asticou meaning boiler, but 'Asticou' is now thought to be a misprint as the Algonquin (Anishinaabemowin) word for boiler/cauldron is Akikok, and an Algonquin name for the location is Akikodjiwan. The European name comes from the French Chutes de la Chaudi√®re, meaning \\"Cauldron Falls\\", historically translated as \\"Kettle Falls\\". The shape of the falls before its development resembled a large kettle, better known to today's English speakers as a cauldron. William S. Hunter Jr. suggested a different origin for the name in 1855: \\"The Word Chaudiere is the literal translation into French of the Indian (sic) word Kanajo (The Kettle), and is . . . vastly suggestive, for the chasm into which the waters of the Ottawa (Ottawa River) discharge themselves is not unlike a kettle in shape, while the seething and frothing of the surface, in its continual whirl, assists in completing the resemblance,\\" though Hunter himself provides no reference, historical or otherwise, to contradict de Champlain's account of the naming of the falls. From a 1909 publication, sourced on the Canadian National Museum of History's website: \\"While waiting thus for their prey to break cover, from up or down the river, they devoted their spare time to various occupations. To the oki, whose thunderous voice was heard in the roar of the falls, they made sacrifices of tobacco; while the Mohawks and Onondagas each gave a name to that cauldron of seething water which is known to us as The Big Kettle. The Mohawks called it Tsitkanajoh, or the Floating Kettle, while the Onondagas named it Katsidagweh niyoh or Chief Council Fire. It is possible that our Big Kettle may be a modified or corrupted translation of the Mohawk term.\\" Vol. XXIII, No. 4: 61-68 & Vol. XXIII, No. 5:92-104 Akikodjiwan is the name given to the falls by some Anishinaabe peoples of this area. For Anishinaabe who gathered and traded along portage routes surrounding the Falls, the waterfall's whirlpool was the bowl of a great peace pipe, and its mists were smoke rising to the Creator. The Falls are within the much larger unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people, encompassing Eastern Ontario and most of Western Quebec. The damming of the river and the presence of industry have greatly altered the lands surrounding the waterfall, and the fall's appearance. This is especially true in the summer when the Ottawa River is low, and the falls all but disappear because the water is diverted to power stations owned and operated by Portage Power, an affiliate of Hydro Ottawa. Inaccessible for generations, the Falls and hydro facilities are now publicly accessible since the opening of Chaudiere Falls park in 2017, designed by architect Douglas Cardinal. Other properties adjacent to the Falls are slated for development by public and private interests, including an Indigenous welcome centre on Victoria Island, lead by the National Capital Commission (NCC) with regional First Nation representatives, and Zibi, a private mixed-use redevelopment project. History = Pre-Contact Indigenous Trade and Travel = Prior to European contact and colonization, the area surrounding the Chaudi√®re Falls and islands was a significant meeting place between peoples in the region. Hunting grounds and temporary or semi- permanent settlements dotted the banks of the Ottawa River (Kichi Sipi), as rivers and waterways were used as highways, thanks to innovations such as the canoe. Water levels around the Chaudiere Falls would fluctuate throughout the year, depending on rain and snow melts, and would flood the islands and large swaths of land throughout the watershed. The primary inhabitants of the region were the Algonquin Anishinaabe, who carved complex networks of portage routes to circumvent waterfalls and other natural landmarks. =Exploration and the fur trade= The Chaudi√®re Falls and Chaudi√®re Island in 1838 before damming. Samuel de Champlain is the first recorded European to label the falls, chaudi√®re, (which the English for a time would call 'Big Kettle') during his 1613 voyage along the Ottawa River. Champlain describes in his journal on June 14, 1613: :\\"At one place the water falls with such violence upon a rock, that, in the course of time, there has been hollowed out in it a wide and deep basin, so that the water flows round and round there and makes, in the middle, great whirlpools. Hence, the savages call it Asticou, which means kettle. This waterfall makes such a noise that it can be heard for more than two leagues off.\\" :\\"After having carried their canoes to the foot of the falls, they assembled at one place where one of them with a wooden plate takes up a collection, and each one of them places in this plate a piece of tobacco‚Ä¶ the plate is placed in the middle of the group, and all dance about it, singing in their fashion; then one of the chiefs makes a speech, pointing out that for a long time they have been accustomed to making this offering, and that by this means they are protected from their enemies‚Ä¶the speaker takes the plate and throws the tobacco into the middle of la chaudi√®re [kettle] and they make a great cry all together.\\" As a medicine plant, the use of tobacco in this Indigenous ceremony signifies that the falls were made a sacred offering. In the days of the fur trade, the Chaudi√®re Falls were an obstacle along the Ottawa River trade route. Canoes were portaged around the falls at the place now known as Hull. =European colonization= The Royal party running the Chaudi√®re timber slide on a timber crib, September 1901 The arrival of Philemon Wright to this area in 1800 marked the start of the development of the city of Hull. In 1827, the region's first bridge, Union Bridge was built close to the falls. When the logging industry began in this area and farther upstream, the falls were again an obstacle for log driving. In 1829, Ruggles Wright (son of Philemon Wright) built the first timber slide, allowing logs and timber rafts to bypass the falls along the north shore, along what is now known as rue Laurier in Gatineau. In 1836, George Buchannan built a slide for cribs between Victoria and Chaudi√®re Islands (on the south side of the river) which later became a major tourist attraction where King Edward VII (then Prince Albert of Wales) in 1860, and the future George V in 1901 both experienced the thrill of \\"shooting the slides\\". Also in the 19th century, some of Canada's largest sawmills were located near the falls. Notable lumber barons in this area were Henry Franklin Bronson and John Rudolphus Booth. Since then, all the islands and shores at the Chaudi√®re Falls have been developed and the river's flow and drop have long been harnessed to operate paper mills and power stations. In 1910, the ring dam that diverts water to the power stations was built. The E. B. Eddy Company operated a matchmaking business, and a variety of pulp and paper mills, later acquired by Montreal- based Domtar Inc. in 1998. Operations ceased in 2007, the majority of the private properties put up for sale, and transfer to Hydro Ottawa and Hydro- Qu√©bec to operate run-of-the-river hydro-electric generating stations at the falls. Victoria Island Victoria Island, part of Chaudi√®re Island on lower left, Ottawa mainland on right, and Parliament Hill in background Victoria Island () is located in Ontario between Ottawa and Gatineau on the Ottawa River, where it narrows near the Canadian War Museum at LeBreton Flats. The island is accessible via the Chaudi√®re Bridge, which connects Ottawa's Booth Street to Rue Eddy in Gatineau; the Portage Bridge connecting the two cities passes over. The island had been used by First Nations people for centuries, who named the area Asinabka (Place of Glare Rock). According to archaeological evidence, this site was the centre of convergence for trade and spiritual and cultural exchange. Its position‚Äîat the meeting place of three rivers and perched on a rocky point overlooking fast-moving water‚Äîgave it special meaning. It is currently part of an area administered by the National Capital Commission. The island contains an Indigenous business, Aboriginal Experiences, which offers the history of the First Nations people, a tour, traditional dance, a cafe, and a First Nations craft workshop, all in a wood- pole-fence enclosed area. In 2012, it was selected as the site of Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence's protest, due to its proximity to Parliament Hill and its significance to Aboriginal peoples. Inspired by Algonquin chief and elder William Commanda's vision for Asinabka (the traditional Algonquin Anishinabe name Commanda held for the site), and of a Circle of All Nations and the 8th Fire Prophecy, world-renowned architect Douglas Cardinal has designed plans for an aboriginal healing and international peacekeeping centre on the site. Although there is general consensus for the developments on Victoria Island, while some dispute Commanda's vision for the other islands and falls, his full vision is documented in a presentation he made to the City of Ottawa in 2010 and is also more extensively documented on the Asinabka.com website. Victoria Island contains the following buildings: Aboriginal Experiences Centre, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company Steam Plant, the Bronson Company Office, No. 4 Generating Station, the Wilson Carbide Mill and Ottawa Hydro Generating Station #2. On October 3, 2018, the National Capital Commission (NCC) announced that it would be closing down all access to the island, including its businesses, for remediation work from December 2018 to Spring 2020. A second remediation phase is proposed to be undertaken between 2020 and 2025. \\"Zibi\\" redevelopment project \\"Zibi\\" is a mixed-use development started by Windmill Development Group, later joined by a larger development company, DREAM Unlimited Corporation, and then spun off from Windmill with a new company named Theia Partners, that includes residential, commercial, retail, office and hotel spaces, being built on the northern riverbank in Gatineau, QC, and on Chaudiere and Albert Islands in Ottawa, ON. The 15-year redevelopment will repurpose the existing E. B. Eddy buildings and build new developments adjacent to the Falls. It will be home to approximately 3,500 residents when completed. The redevelopment is opposed by groups and individuals hoping to restore the site to a natural state and return the unceded area to Algonquin stewardship. Windmill named the project \\"Zibi\\", the Algonquin Anishinabe word for river, following a public naming competition. Patrick Henry, who entered the winning suggestion, declined the prize and asked that the money go to a canoe trip involving Kitigan Zibi youth instead, but the youth then asked that they not accept the money. Speaking personally, the then-Chief of Kitigan Zibi Gilbert Whiteduck confirmed having had several respectful discussions with the company representatives but stated they did not consult with Algonquin Elders, nor follow proper protocols. The company alleges the name was chosen to celebrate the significant waterways in the region, and bring attention to the Algonquin Nation's traditional territory in Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec. Since 2015, the First Nation partners of the project are the Algonquins of Pikw√†kanag√†n First Nation, and the Algonquins of Ontario (AOO), representing 10 communities, including Pikwakanagan. The AOO is the only named Algonquin Aboriginal Interest in the City of Ottawa's official plan (section 5.6). In April 2017, two more communities signed Letters of Intent with the development, Long Point First Nation and Timiskaming First Nation. These communities are working with the developers towards tangible benefits such as long-term employment and job training, investment opportunities, residential and commercial ownership, public art, and tangible recognition of Algonquin Anishinabe traditional territory. According to Windmill, they have made efforts since 2013 to change the traditional relationship between First Nation communities and private development, and have engaged sincerely and meaningfully with all Algonquin Anishinabe communities in Ontario and Quebec, and several tribal Councils. All but one of the ten status Algonquin communities opposed the Zibi project, although as noted above, two of those communities shifted their position. \\"Free The Falls\\" formed to support the Ontario Municipal Board appeal of the city's rezoning of the site as well as to support the Asinabka vision. Chaudi√®re and Albert Islands to their natural state, and is collecting signatures on a petition to that end. This non-Indigenous group views it as an example of cultural appropriation, \\"red-washed commercial exploitation\\", and a violation of Indigenous Rights as per the UNDRIP. They disagree with the development because they believe that the islands around the falls have been a sacred religious site for millennia, and would prefer to see all islands turned into public parkland and Indigenous site as per the 1950s NCC plans, the Asinabka vision led by the late Algonquin leader William Commanda, and the AFN resolution of December 2015. Other notable project opponents include Indigenous architect Douglas Cardinal and author John Ralston Saul. For Algonquin communities that are partners to the project, non-Indigenous interventions in Zibi have been an issue in advancing economically in the region. Chief Kirby Whiteduck of Pikwakanagan stated that \\"The Algonquin people don't need to be saved from the Zibi project\\". Others such as Albert Dumont from Kitigan Zibi reproach the project's leadership for being non- Indigenous. Discussions with several other Algonquin communities are ongoing with the developers. Hydroelectric power generation The falls at spring high water level, April 16, 2006. =Centrale Hull 2= Centrale Hull 2 is a 27 MW 4-turbine hydroelectric generating station on the Ottawa River on the Gatineau side of the Chaudi√®re Falls (). It is owned by Hydro-Qu√©bec and is listed as a run-of-the-river dam and its commission date as 1920‚Äì1969. Its reservoir capacity is . The station was originally built in 1912-1913 for the Gatineau Power Company by William Kennedy Jr. but did not begin operating until 1920, following World War I, when it had two turbines in operation. A third turbine was added in 1923. In 1965, Gatineau Power was sold to Hydro- Qu√©bec, which added a fourth turbine in 1968. =Chaudi√®re Falls Generating Stations= Hydro Ottawa operates two run-of-the-river hydroelectric generating stations without a dam. Generating Station 2 was built in 1891 and is leased from the National Capital Commission. Generating Station No. 4 was built in 1900 and is operated on land owned by the Government of Canada. The combined output is around 110 GWh per year. The stations were refurbished in the 2000s, including a small capacity increase in 2007. Hydro Ottawa purchased the site around the falls from Domtar Corporation in 2012, including the ring dam and water rights. A project started in 2015 and completed in 2017 increased the generating capacity of the stations from 29 to 58 MW. This project buried new turbines below grade next to the falls, enabling public access, new viewing platforms and a park celebrating Algonquin and industrial heritages.

In theories that apply the principle of relativity to inertial motion, physics is the same in all inertial frames, and is even the same in all frames under the principle of general relativity. Preferred frame in aether theory In theories that presume that light travels at a fixed speed relative to an unmodifiable and detectable luminiferous aether, a preferred frame would be a frame in which this aether would be stationary. In 1887, Michelson and Morley tried to identify the state of motion of the aether. To do so, they assumed Galilean relativity to be satisfied by clocks and rulers; that is, that the length of rulers and periods of clocks are invariant under any Galilean frame change. Under such an hypothesis, the aether should have been observed. By comparing measurements made in different directions and looking for an effect due to the Earth's orbital speed, their experiment famously produced a null result. As a consequence, within Lorentz ether theory the Galilean transformation was replaced by the Lorentz transformation. However, in Lorentz aether theory the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the relativity principle holds. The theory was quickly replaced by special relativity, which gave similar formulas without the existence of an unobservable aether. All inertial frames are physically equivalent, in both theories. More precisely, provided that no phenomenon violates the principle of relativity of motion, there is no means to measure the velocity of an inertial observer with regard to a possible medium of propagation of quantum waves. Inertial frames preferred above noninertial frames There is a privileged set of frames whose physics do not require external causes. Although all inertial frames are equivalent under classical mechanics and special relativity, the set of all inertial frames is privileged over non-inertial frames in these theories. Inertial frames are privileged because they do not have physics whose causes are outside of the system, while non-inertial frames do. Einstein gives the following example: suppose two equally-composed elastic bodies are in space and distant from each other such that the interaction between them can be ignored, and whose only relative motion is a uniform rigid rotation around the line joining the centers of both bodies (like spinning wheels around an axle). One of the bodies is a sphere, and the other is a spheroid, a squashed sphere. The observable proper physical shape of the bodies remains the same in all frames. The non-rotating-spheroid frame has physics whose cause lies outside the system, responsible for the oblateness of the spheroid. The non-rotating- sphere frame does not, which makes it privileged in that it doesn't require external causes. This applies to all inertial frames, who are privileged in the same regard. Einstein went on to develop general relativity and the equivalence principle, in which inertial-gravitational frames are no longer privileged, because the geodesics of spacetime explain these inertial- gravitational effects without an external cause.

Shotgun houses consist of three to five rooms in a row with no hallways and have a narrow, rectangular structure. Fifth Ward neighborhood of Houston, Texas, 1973, as pictured in a photo by Danny Lyon. A shotgun house is a narrow rectangular domestic residence, usually no more than about wide, with rooms arranged one behind the other and doors at each end of the house. It was the most popular style of house in the Southern United States from the end of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65) through the 1920s. Alternate names include shotgun shack, shotgun hut, shotgun cottage, and in the case of a multihome dwelling, shotgun apartment; the design is similar to that of railroad apartments. A longstanding theory is that the style can be traced from Africa to Haitian influences on house design in New Orleans, but the houses can be found as far away as Key West and Ybor City in Florida, and Texas, and as far north as Chicago, Illinois. Though initially as popular with the middle class as with the poor, the shotgun house became a symbol of poverty in the mid-20th century. Urban renewal has led to the destruction of many shotgun houses; however, in areas affected by gentrification, historic preservation efforts have led to the renovation of such houses. Several variations of shotgun houses allow for additional features and space, and many have been updated to the needs of later generations of owners. The oldest shotgun houses were built without indoor plumbing, but this was often added later, often on the back of the house (sometimes crudely). \\"Double-barrel\\" or \\"double\\" shotgun houses are a semi-detached configuration, consisting of two houses sharing a central wall, allowing more houses to be fit into an area. \\"Camelback\\" shotgun houses include a second floor at the rear of the house. In some cases the entire floor plan is changed during remodeling to create hallways. History Shotgun houses in Louisville, Kentucky. In cities, shotguns were built close together for a variety of reasons. The origins of both the term and the architectural form and development of the shotgun house are controversial, even more so in the wake of conflicting preservation and redevelopment efforts since Hurricane Katrina. Third Ward of Houston, Texas north of Truxillo has many shotgun shacks A single shotgun in Avalon, Mississippi, was the house of Mississippi John Hurt, now a museum. A pair of single shotgun houses, dating to the 1920s, in the Campground Historic District of Mobile, Alabama New Orleans architectural historian Samuel Wilson, Jr. influentially suggested that shotgun-style houses originated in the Creole suburbs (faubourgs) of New Orleans in the early 1800s. He also stated that the term \\"shotgun\\" is a reference to the idea that if all the doors are opened, a shotgun blast fired into the house from the front doorway will fly cleanly to the other end and out at the back. Alternatively, folklorist and professor John Michael Vlach has suggested that the origin of the building style and the name itself may trace back to Haiti and Africa during the 18th century and earlier. Vlach claimed the name may have originated from a Dahomey Fon area term 'to-gun', which means \\"place of assembly\\". The description, probably used in New Orleans by Afro-Haitian slaves, may have been misunderstood and reinterpreted as \\"shotgun\\".Vlach, J: \\"Shotgun houses\\", pages 51‚Äì57. Natural History 86, 1977). Citing Vlach, James Deetz claimed archaeological support for an African origin in his dig at Parting Ways, a 1790s community of freed black slaves in Plymouth, Massachusetts; his shotgun interpretation of the extremely limited evidence ‚Äì two rooms that \\"may or may not have been unified\\" ‚Äì has been challenged as \\"premature\\".. Illustration, The Plymouth Colony Archive Project Vlach's theory behind the earlier African origin is tied to the history of New Orleans. In 1803 there were 1,355 free blacks in the city. By 1810 blacks outnumbered whites 10,500 to 4,500. This caused a housing boom. As many of both the builders and inhabitants were Africans by way of Haiti, Vlach maintained it was only natural they modeled the new homes after ones they left behind in their homeland. Many surviving Haitian dwellings of the period, including about 15 percent of the housing stock of Port-au-Prince, resemble the single shotgun houses of New Orleans. The shotgun house was popularized in New Orleans, and, as Fred Kniffen documented in a statewide survey of Louisiana house types in the 1930s, the greatest number are found dispersed from there in a manner that supports the diffusion theory. The style was definitely built there by 1832, though there is evidence that houses sold in the 1830s were built 15 to 20 years earlier. A simpler theory is that they are the typical one-room-deep floor plan popular in the rural south, rotated to accommodate narrow city lots. Such houses were built throughout hot urban areas in the South, since the style's length and outside doors at each end allowed for excellent airflow, while its narrow frontage increased the number of lots that could be fitted along a street. It was used so frequently that some southern cities estimate that, even today, 10% or more of their housing stock is composed of shotgun houses.Burns, Richard Allen. The Shotgun Houses of Trumann, Arkansas, Arkansas Review, (April 2002), Vol. 33, Issue 1 The earliest known use of \\"shotgun house\\" as a name for these dwellings is in a classified advertisement in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August 30, 1903: \\"Two 3-room houses near the railroad yards at Simpson st. crossing, rent $12 a month to good tenants who pay in advance; price $1,200 on terms or $100 cash, balance $15 a month; a combination of investment and savings bank: these are not shacks, but good shot-gun houses in good repair.\\" While this advertisement seems to present shotgun houses as a desirable working-class housing alternative, by 1929 a Tennessee court noted that shotgun houses could not be rented to any other than a very poor class of tenants.Moore v. Minnis, 11 Tenn.App. 88 (Tenn. App. 1929). After the Great Depression few shotgun houses were built, and existing ones went into decline. By the late 20th century shotgun houses in some areas were being restored as housing and for other uses. Shotgun houses were often initially built as rental properties, located near manufacturing centers or railroad hubs, to provide housing for workers. Owners of factories frequently built the houses to rent specifically to employees, usually for a few dollars a month. However, by the late 20th century shotguns were often owner-occupied. For example, 85% of the houses (many of them shotgun) in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward were owner- occupied.Starr, S. Frederick. The New Orleans Shotgun: Down but Not Out. New York Times. September 22, 2005. pg. F.7. Shotgun houses were most popular before widespread ownership of the automobile allowed people to live farther from businesses and other destinations. Building lots were small, wide at most. An influx of people to cities, both from rural areas in America and from foreign countries, all looking to fill emerging manufacturing jobs, created the high demand for housing in cities. Shotgun houses were built to fulfill the same need as rowhouses in Northeastern cities. Several were often built at a time by a single builder, contributing to their similar appearance. Characteristics Floor plan of a typical single shotgun with bathroom The rooms of a shotgun house are lined up one behind the other, typically a living room is first, then one or two bedrooms, and finally a kitchen in back. Early shotgun houses were not built with bathrooms, but in later years a bathroom with a small hall was built before the last room of the house, or a side addition was built off the kitchen. Some shotguns have only two rooms. Chimneys tended to be built in the interior, allowing the front and middle rooms to share a chimney with a fireplace opening in each room. The kitchen usually has its own chimney. Other than the basic floor layout, shotgun houses have many standard features in common. The house is almost always close to the street, sometimes with a very short front yard. In some cases, the house has no setback and is actually flush with the sidewalk. The original steps were wood, but were often replaced with permanent concrete steps. Sketch of a typical camelback, or -story, shotgun house, with a detailed sketch of a typical decorative wooden door bracket A sign of its New Orleans heritage, the house is usually raised off the ground. There is a single door and window in the front of the house, and often a side door leading into the back room, which is slightly wider than the rest of the house. The front door and window often were originally covered by decorative shutters. Side walls may or may not have windows; rooms adjoining neither the front nor back door will generally have at least one window even when the houses are built very close together. Typically, shotgun houses have a wood-frame structure and wood siding, although some examples exist in brick and even stone. Many shotguns, especially older or less expensive ones, have flat roofs that end at the front wall of the house. In houses built after 1880, the roof usually overhangs the front wall, and there is usually a gable above the overhang. The overhang is usually supported by decorative wooden brackets, and sometimes contains cast iron ventilators. The rooms are well-sized, and have relatively high ceilings for cooling purposes, as when warm air can rise higher, the lower part of a room tends to be cooler. The lack of hallways allows for efficient cross- ventilation in every room. Rooms usually have some decoration such as moldings, ceiling medallions, and elaborate woodwork. In cities like New Orleans, local industries supplied elaborate but mass-produced brackets and other ornaments for shotgun houses that were accessible even to homeowners of modest means. Variations Project Row Houses in Third Ward Houston, Texas Uptown section of New Orleans. Double shotgun houses were a form of multiple- family housing, where essentially two conventional shotgun houses shared a central wall. A classic camelback shotgun house in Uptown New Orleans The double shotgun requires less land per household than the traditional shotgun and was used extensively in poorer areas because it could be built with fewer materials and use less land per occupant. It was first seen in New Orleans in 1854. A camelback house, also called humpback, is a variation of the shotgun that has a partial second floor over the rear of the house. Camelback houses were built in the later period of shotgun houses. The floor plan and construction is very similar to the traditional shotgun house, except there are stairs in the back room leading up to the second floor. The second floor, or \\"hump\\", contains one to four rooms. Because it was only a partial second story, most cities only taxed it as a single-story house ‚Äì this was a key reason for their construction. A combination, the Double Camelback shotgun, also exists. A minor variation is a side door allowing access to the kitchen, or a porch along the side extending almost the length of the house. \\"North shore\\" houses are shotgun houses with wide verandas on three sides. They were so named because most were built on the north shore of New Orleans' Lake Pontchartrain as summer homes for wealthy whites. Decline and legacy The construction of shotgun houses slowed and eventually stopped during the early 20th century. The increased affordability of two technological innovations, the car and consumer air conditioning units, made the key advantages of the shotgun house obsolete to home buyers. After World War II, shotgun houses had very little appeal to those building or buying new houses, as car-oriented modern suburbs were built en masse. Few shotgun houses have been built in America since the war, although the concept of a simple, single-level floor plan lived on in ranch-style houses. The surviving urban shotgun houses suffered problems related to those typically facing the inner city neighborhoods in which they were located. The flight of affluent residents to the suburbs, absentee owners, and a shortage of mortgage lenders for inner- city residents led to the deterioration of shotgun houses in the mid- and late 20th century. Confusing ownership, passed down within a family over several generations, also contributed to many houses sitting vacant for years. The George Wall House, an original shotgun home in Walltown, Durham, North Carolina. Though shotguns are sometimes perceived as being prevalent in poor African American neighborhoods, many originally constituted much of the housing stock of segregated white neighborhoods. Many of these neighborhoods became predominantly black during the 1950s and 1960s, but many others did not and remain predominantly white. A single shotgun house in Bloomington, Indiana Regardless of who was living in them, from World War II until the 1980s shotguns came to be widely viewed as substandard housing and a symbol of poverty, and they were demolished by many urban renewal projects. This thinking is no longer so prevalent, with such cities as Charlotte establishing \\"Shotgun Historic Districts\\". Shotgun houses have even been praised as quality and cost-effective cultural assets that promote a distinctive urban life. Other cities, such as Macon, Georgia, experimented with renovating shotgun houses for low-income residents and, though there was indecision on whether it would be cheaper to tear them down and build new housing, some were rebuilt. There are many large neighborhoods in older American cities of the south which still contain a high concentration of shotgun houses today. Examples include Third Ward in Houston; Bywater in New Orleans; The Hill in St. Louis; Portland, Butchertown and Germantown in Louisville; Cabbagetown in Atlanta and Village West of Coconut Grove in Miami where the last remaining 25 shotgun homes have been designated as historic structures. Their role in the history of the south has become recognized; for example, in October 2001 Rice University sponsored an exhibition called \\"Shotguns 2001\\". This three-day event featured lectures on and artistic paintings of the houses, as well as presentations and panel discussions in a neighborhood of restored shotguns. In some shotgun-dominated neighborhoods, property value has become quite high, leading to gentrification. Sometimes, a new owner will buy both homes of a double-barreled shotgun structure and combine them, to form a relatively large single house. Shotguns are also often combined to renovate them into office or storage space. A limited revival Elements of the shotgun style have recently been seen in a number of the compact, low-occupancy structures employed in the Solar Decathlon contests held periodically in Washington, DC. While some are erected from panels brought to the site, many such structures consist of enclosed single or multiple units designed specifically for road transports, with multiple modules connected on site, and compact linear structures often employ multiple-use \\"zones\\" rather than specifically private areas, while retaining a linear progression of spaces. In 2011 Louisville's daily newspaper, The Courier-Journal, reported that a local nonprofit agency devoted to building and renovating affordable housing was building new shotgun houses in a development in southwest Louisville. Popular and Southern culture Tupelo, Mississippi in which Elvis Presley was born The shotgun house plays a large role in the folklore and culture of the south. Superstition holds that ghosts and spirits are attracted to shotgun houses because they may pass straight through them, and that some houses were built with doors intentionally misaligned to deter these spirits. They also often serve as a convenient symbol of life in the south. Elvis Presley was born in a shotgun house,Marling, Karal Ann (Autumn 1993). Elvis Presley's Graceland, or the Aesthetic of Rock 'n' Roll Heaven, American Art, Vol. 7, No. 4, pp. 72‚Äì105. Aaron Neville of The Neville Brothers grew up in one, and according to bluesman David Honeyboy Edwards, Robert Johnson died in one.Styles, Sean (2001). Trail of the Hellhound - Delta Blues in the Lower Mississippi Valley: Delta Sites, U.S. National Park Service. Retrieved April 4, 2006. David Honeyboy Edwards indicates a yellow shotgun house where he says Robert Johnson died. Shortly before his death in May 1997, Jeff Buckley rented a shotgun house in Memphis and was so enamoured with it he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it. Dream Brother, David Browne's biography of Jeff and Tim Buckley, opens with a description of this shotgun house and Jeff's fondness of it. One of the more widely known references to a shotgun house is in the 1980 Talking Heads song \\"Once In A Lifetime\\". The first line of the song is \\"And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack\\". The John Mellencamp song \\"Pink Houses\\" was inspired when he was driving along an overpass on the way home to Bloomington, Indiana from the Indianapolis airport. There was an old black man sitting outside his little pink shotgun house with his cat in his arms, completely unperturbed by the traffic speeding along the highway in his front yard. ‚ÄúHe waved, and I waved back,‚Äù Mellencamp said in an interview with Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúThat's how 'Pink Houses' started.‚Äù. In Bruce Springsteen's song \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\", from the album Wrecking Ball, he refers to shotgun houses, singing \\"We take care of our own, from the shotgun shack to the Super Dome\\".

Its southern terminus is at Route Z inside the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. The route travels north and intersects a few county roads as it leaves the national park. The road ends at U.S. Route 60 in a three-way junction. After being proposed in 1930, a road was built from the national park to US 60 in 1933. The gravel road was designated as Route 103, and it was paved five years later. Route description Map of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, with Route 103 marked on the southeast portion of the map All of the route is located in Carter County. In 2016, the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated 267 vehicles, including 29 trucks travelling on Route 103 north of its southern terminus. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Route 103 begins at the intersection of Peavine Road and Route Z inside the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, at the Big Spring Historic District. The road travels westward through the forest, and it curves northward near the southern terminus of Skyline Drive. The route then intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 202 (CRD 202) north of Skyline Drive. About past CRD 202, Route 103 leaves the national park, and it meets the northern ends of Skyline Drive and Peavine Road. The road shifts to the northeast, and intersects a road leading to the unincorporated area of Chicopee. The road ends at US 60 in South Van Buren at a three-way junction south of Current River and the city of Van Buren. History Around 1930, a road was proposed to start from the Ozark National Scenic Riverways to US 60 as a park connection. The gravel road was constructed by 1933, and it was designated as Route 103. The route was paved by 1938, as part of a larger project with a cost of $836,300 (), with a fraction going to Route 103's improvement. In 1959, a project was announced to establish a supplemental route, Route Z, that would start at the southern terminus of Route 103. The route was built as a gravel road by 1961, and it was paved around nine years later.

Its common names include spikenard, herbal aralia, udo (from ), Japanese spikenard, and mountain asparagus. It is commonly found on the slopes of wooded embankments. Aralia cordata is a species of Aralia in the family Araliaceae. The plant yields new shoots every spring, which are blanched and then eaten as a vegetable. In Korea, the dried root of the plant has been traditionally used as medicine. The young shoots have a strong yet pleasant distinct aromatic flavor. In addition to food and medicinal use, the plant is cultivated as an ornamental. Description Aralia cordata is classified as a dicot and a eudicot.Kwon, T. R., Kim, S. K., Min, G. G., Jo, J. H., Lee, S. P., Choi, B. S. (1995). The leaves are alternate, large, and double to triple pinnate with leaflets long, and broad. The flowers are produced in large umbels of diameter in late summer, each flower small and white. The fruit is a small black drupe diameter, and may be toxic to humans. In the wild, the plant achieves a height of .Hibino, T., Shibata, D., Ito, T., Tsuchiya, D., Higuchi, T., Pollet, B., Lapierre, C. 1994.Weimer, J.L. (1923). It has golden leaves in the spring and an abundance of large bright green ones in the summer.Horticulture Week. 2012. p. 11. It has a hefty and plump root stock with shoots in length.Messrs., Lathrop., Fairchild. (1903). It can reach optimal growth when planted in rich soil. During the summer it produces loose flower bunches in length, which are attractive to bees and flies, making it ideal for beekeepers. It can be grown using seed or propagated from cuttings. History Aralia cordata is widely grown for food in Japan. In the early 1900s it was imported into the United States; however, it did not become popularly commercialized. In Korea, the dried root has been traditionally used as medicine to treat inflammation, fever and pain.Kim, C. J., Park, T. W., Cho, B. J., Lee, J. Y., Kim, T. D. 2010. Cultivation =Growing conditions= Aralia cordata can be grown in normal, sandy, or clay soil with a neutral or acidic content of pH 5.0 to 7.5. Organic material should be added to clays and sands.Learn2grow. 2006-2013. It is an easy plant to grow, and does not require fertilizer.Walters Gardens Inc. (2013). The plant grows rapidly, attaining a size up to in height and width in a single growing season. It can tolerate freezing temperatures during winter, as it dies back and then re-grows in the spring,Weimer, J.L. (1923) yielding for six years or more. It requires little labor; however the shoots require blanching if intended for food use. It must be grown in a climate of minimal to no drought, and can grow well in moist and rainy areas, and mountainous areas. It is generally grown in the wild, but can be grown in fields, cellars, or nurseries. The plant prefers light shade, but can grow in full shade, or in full sun, provided that it has a reliable water source. The seed propagation requires numerous months of stratification for effective germination.Lee, K. S., Lee, J. C., Soh, W.Y. 2002. Seeds generally do not germinate well directly after harvesting or in dry storage, but germinate well in cold moist sand. Low temperature treatments facilitate the germination process. Chilling treatments are useful to overcome the dormancy of seeds in dry storage. Domestic seeds germinate more effectively than wild ones.IMAZU, T., OSAWA, T. (1958). The plant propagates readily by root suckering, allowing it to produce indefinitely. =Diseases= The disease ‚ÄúRootrot‚Äù targets the stems and roots only observable when three-fourths of its growth has been reached. In large plants, which can have 10 to 15 stems, the leaves wither very gradually from the base to the top, and the plant can take an entire growing season to completely die. The leaves and the stems turn brown and the roots deteriorate, with numerous large black fungi. In small plants, the leaves wilt, the petioles deteriorate, and the stems decay until the entire plant breaks down. In humidity, an abundance of white fungus grows over the exterior. Insects and rodents may be responsible for distributing fungus, or infected soil may enter the roots through root hairs, deceased roots, or lesions from cultivation or cutting. Land should be chosen with no susceptible vegetation. Plants should be grown from seed, minimizing the risk of contamination from root cuttings. Tools should be washed, and gardeners should be cautious about the particles they and their animals introduce. Cutting the plants during cultivation should be avoided. When the field has become infected, cultivation should be suspended for several years. The disease may be controlled, but there were no susceptible or resistant varieties known . The disease ‚ÄúWilt‚Äù causes the leaves to turn yellow, then brown, and eventually dry up. The petioles die, continuing to cling to the stalks for a frequent amount of time. In the case of an infected field, an alternative field with thick soil should be used, as Wilt is less damaging on this type. To prevent and control the disease, it may be sanitary to remove deceased, worn, and diseased vegetation, soil, and compost. At the end of the season, the soil and plants should be sorted to minimize the risk of accumulated disease. =Genetic stock= There is genetic diversity of this crop in the provinces of China; however further research is required.Qu, F., Zhou, J., Zhou, Z., Li, H., Burrows, E. (2009). There is genetic similarity between Aralia cordata and Aralia hispida, as in prehistoric times there was a close connection between Eastern Asia and North America, facilitating the migration of plant species.Zhuravlev, Y. N., Artyukova, E. V., Kozyrenko, M. M., Reunova, G. D. (2002). The northern variation is less matured, with smaller stem hairs, fewer nodes, side shoots, and leaves than the southern variation, potentially caused by earlier flourishing. In domestic stocks there is not as much variation, although they are similar to the wild stocks of the south, which have shorter dormancy periods.IMAZU, T., OSAWA, T. (1960).  Culinary use  = Japan = The edible stem is sometimes boiled and served in miso soup. Despite its size, Aralia cordata is not a woody plant, as demonstrated in the popular saying udo no taiboku (), literally \\"great wood of udo\\", meaning roughly \\"useless\\", as udo has a very soft stem. Young stems are consumed from the rootsMagness, J.R., G.M. Markle, C.C. Compton. (1971) and added to soups and salads. It must be properly cooked, as the raw stems are coated in a resin tasting similar to pine. Prior to eating, they should be thinly sliced and boiled in water a few times or placed in chilled water for an hour to eliminate the resin. The stems may be cooked like asparagus. = Korea = Ttangdureup (spikenards) Ttangdureup-sanjeok (beef and spikenard skewers) The plant is called ttangdureup(, \\"land angelica\\") in Korean. Young shoots of spikenards are harvested during a month, from early April to early May, when they are soft and fragrant. In Korean cuisine, the shoots are commonly eaten blanched as namul, pickled as jangajji, pan-fried as jeon, or grilled as sanjeok. In Imsil County, they are also used for maeuntang (spicy fish stew). ; Dishes * Ttangdureup-jangajji ‚Äì a type of jangajji (pickle), made by blanching spikenards and pickling it. The pickling sauce is made by boiling the mixture of soy sauce, water, maesil-cheong (plum syrup), sugar, and vinegar with kelp, then cooling it. * Ttangdureup-jeon ‚Äì a type of jeon, made by blanching spikenards, coating them with starch and eggwashing them, then pan-frying them in oil * Ttangdureup-maeun-tang ‚Äì a type of maeun-tang (spicy soup), made of freshwater fish such as Amur catfish. In Imsil County, spikenards replace siraegi (dried radish greens) in maeuntang recipes. The stew can be made by boiling fish with big chunks of radish, then adding spikenards, onion, aehobak, Java waterdropwort, oyster mushrooms, red chilli, and spicy sauce. The spicy sauce, usually prepared the day before and left in the fridge overnight, can be made by mixing gochujang (chilli paste), doenjang (bean paste), gochugaru (chilli powder), toasted perilla seeds, minced garlic, and ground ginger. * Ttangdureup-muchim ‚Äì a type of namul, made by blanching the shoots in salted water, seasoning them with soup soy sauce, chopped scallions, minced garlic, sesame oil, and toasted sesame seeds  Nutritional information  Per 100 grams of raw stem, Aralia cordata contains 220 mg of potassium, 7 mg of calcium, 9 mg of magnesium, 25 mg of phosphorus, 0.2 mg of iron, 0.1 mg of zinc and 4 mg of vitamin C.Natural Agriculture. (2005). Economics Aralia cordata is popularly grown in Korea and Japan, and is grown in North America for use in exotic cuisine, and as an ornamental plant. It has a great potential for medicine to reduce fever and symptoms of disease. The root is often used in China as a substitute for ginseng, which is another member of the Araliaceae, or ivy family. Aralia cordata must be cooked, soaked, or peeled to eliminate the resinous taste, which may impede its wider adoption. Notes References * Kwon, T. R., Kim, S. K., Min, G. G., Jo, J. H., Lee, S.

After an education at The King's School, Macclesfield and Trinity College, Cambridge he studied under a special pleader, before being called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1813. Although not a particularly distinguished barrister, he was appointed to the Court of King's Bench on 28 November 1828, made a Privy Counsellor in 1833 and, a year later, a Baron of the Exchequer. He resigned his post in 1855, angered by the passing of the Common Law Procedure Acts, but was recalled by the government, who gave him a peerage as Baron Wensleydale, of Walton to allow him to undertake the Judicial functions of the House of Lords, a job he fulfilled until his death on 25 February 1868. Early life and education Parke was born on 22 March 1782 in Highfield, near Liverpool, to Thomas Parke, a merchant, and his wife Anne. He studied at The King's School, Macclesfield before matriculating to Trinity College, Cambridge on 28 February 1799, where he won the Craven scholarship, Sir William Browne's gold medal, and was fifth wrangler and senior chancellor's medallist in classics.

His mental power, his ability to grasp difficult points, to disentangle complicated facts, and to state the law clearly, have seldom been surpassed. No judgments delivered during this period are of greater service to the student of law than his\\". He was criticised for being too respectful of authority and unwilling to overturn precedent; John Coleridge accused him of being dedicated to the form of the law rather than the substance.Harvard Law Review (1897) p.195 The Common Law Procedure Acts 1854 and 1855 led to his resignation from the Exchequer in disgust, but his reputation was such that the government recalled him by granting him a life peerage, that of Baron Wensleydale, of Wensleydale, in the North Riding of Yorkshire on 16 January 1856. There was a question at the time of whether the letters patent, which granted him a peerage \\"for the term of his natural life\\", allowed him to sit in the House of Lords; it was eventually decided that they did not, and a second set was issued with the usual form for Baron Wensleydale, of Walton, in the County Palatine of Lancaster on 23 July 1856.

The club is notable for its football team, that currently plays in the Primera Divisi√≥n, the top level of the Argentine football league system. Its home stadium is the Estadio Tom√°s Adolfo Duc√≥. Hurac√°n was founded on 1 November 1908 in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (Globo, literally \\"Balloon\\") comes from the Hurac√°n (\\"Hurricane\\") balloon flown by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Its supporters are called los Quemeros (\\"the Burners\\") because the stadium is located in a former garbage burning area. Since its establishment, Hurac√°n has won 13 domestic titles (including five Primera Divisi√≥n championships, and most recently the 2014 Supercopa Argentina). Apart from those achievements, the team has finished as runner-up of the top division seven times (the last one in the 2009 Clausura). Hurac√°n's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro. Other sports practised at the club are artistic gymnastics, boxing, field hockey, roller hockey, handball, martial arts and volleyball. History =First steps= Jorge Newbery's balloon served as inspiration to the emblem. On 25 May 1903, a group of boys from Nueva Pompeya, Buenos Aires, founded a football club under the name Los Chiquitos de Pompeya.Grande se nace, 100 a√±os: Centenario del Club Atl√©tico Hurac√°n, N√©stor Vicente, Buenos Aires (2008) ‚Äì In 1907 the name was changed to Verde esperanza y no pierde. On 1 November 1908, a meeting was organised, and therefore the club was named \\"Club Atl√©tico Hurac√°n\\", according to club's certificates, signed by Jos√© Laguna as the first president of the institution. In that meeting the white color with a balloon emblem on the chest, was also established as club's jersey. This was established as the official foundation of Hurac√°n. Likewise, the balloon emblem was a homage to Argentine aviation-pioneer Jorge Newbery's, which had been brought from France and first piloted by Newbery in 1909. The club asked Newbery for permission to use the balloon, which Newbery replied saying \\"I gave my most complete approval to the request, hoping that the team will honor the balloon that crossed three countries (Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil) in a unique trip\\". When Hurac√°n reached the first division, the managers sent a letter to Jorge Newbery that said: \\"Hurac√°n has kept its promise, promoting three divisions, as your balloon crossed three republiques before, so your wish was accomplished\\" Carlos Gardel a trav√©s de su vida In 1910, Jorge Newbery was named \\"protector member\\" of the club. That same year Hurac√°n played in the Liga 43, where 43 clubs from second and fourth divisions took part of the championship. Hurac√°n played its first matches in a field located in Cachi and Traful streets. It was Jorge Newbery who got the lands on Arena street. Newbery also negotiated the affiliation of the club to Argentine Football Association.

The results were not as good as expected and Brindisi was soon replaced by Roberto Pompei, who could not change the situation, and eventually Hurac√°n were relegated to the last position in 2010‚Äì11 season.

He belonged to a family of rabbis, the most noted among them being Rabbi Israel Palota, his great-grandfather, Rabbi Amram (called \\"The Gaon,\\" who died in Safed, Palestine, where he had spent the last years of his life), and Rabbi Chayyim Kitssee, rabbi in Erza, who was his great-granduncle. The last-named was the author of several rabbinic works.  Early training  Kohut's father, Jacob Kohut, was a great linguist, and was well versed in rabbinic literature. He was so poor that he could not afford to send his son to the village school. There being no Hebrew school (cheder) in his native town, Alexander reached his eighth year without having learned even the rudiments of Hebrew or Hungarian. At a very tender age, while selling his mother's tarts in the marketplace, he was kidnapped by Gipsies, because of his extraordinary beauty. His family soon removed to Kecskem√©t, where Kohut received his first instruction. He attended the gymnasium and at the same time studied Talmud with an old scholar, Reb Gershom L√∂vinger. In his fifteenth year, while trying to decipher some foreign words in the Talmud with the aid of Landau's Dictionary, he conceived the plan of writing a complete lexicon of the Talmud, not having found the etymology of many words in Landau. After finishing the gymnasium course in Kecskem√©t, he removed to Budapest. Anxious to continue his rabbinical studies, he went to Breslau. In 1865, he received a call to the rabbinate of Tarnowitz, Upper Silesia. He then spent another year in Breslau, devoting his time to Oriental philology and Semitics. During the previous year he received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Leipzig, his dissertation being \\"Ueber die J√ºdische Angelogie und Daemonologie in Ihrer Abh√§ngigkeit vom Parsismus.\\" The essay was published by the Deutsche Morgenl√§ndische Gesellschaft in 1866, it being the first Jewish work issued under the auspices of that society. He obtained his rabbinical diploma in 1867. It was in 1864 that he began to collect materials for a critical edition of the 'Aruk of Nathan ben Jehiel. In 1867 he was called to the rabbinate of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary. Baron J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s, the famous Hungarian poet and novelist, and afterward \\"Cultusminister,\\" appointed him superintendent of all the schools in the county, this being the first time that such a position had been tendered to a Jew. The Congress of Jewish notables held in Budapest in 1868 appointed Kohut its secretary. Notable among his literary labors falling in this period is his study entitled \\"Etwas √ºber die Moral und Abfassungszeit des Buches Tobias,\\" originally published in Geiger's J√ºd. Zeit. vol. x., several monographs in the Z. D. M. G. which developed his original thesis concerning Persian influence on Judaism, and his \\"Kritische Beleuchtung der Persischen Pentateuch-Uebersetzung des Jakob ben Joseph Tavus\\" (Leipzig, 1871). Among his literary remains are to be found materials for a critical edition of the Persian text of this version. In 1872 he was elected chief rabbi of P√©cs, Hungary, remaining there eight years. By this time his reputation as a Hungarian orator had spread so far that many noted statesmen and church dignitaries came to hear him from distant towns.  Dictionary of the Talmud  About 1873 Kohut began to compile his Dictionary of the Talmud, entirely in German, encouraged by the promise of a Christian nobleman to bear all costs of publication. He had proceeded as far as the third letter of the alphabet when he found that the work was assuming such gigantic proportions as to preclude the possibility of its being confined within the projected limits. Arduous as the merely mechanical labor of copying the manuscript was, he rewrote what he had written, intending to publish the original text of the old 'Aruk, with a German commentary. On the advice of Leopold Zunz and Salomon Buber, however, who argued that the 'Aruk, being a national classic, ought to be compiled in Hebrew throughout, he again rewrote the work in that language, the labor of copying occupying two more years. It is this trait of untiring patience, which scorned all obstacles, that made the publication of vol. I, in 1878, possible. His Maecenas, in the meantime, had died, and Kohut was left to bear the burden of expense alone, save for the subvention of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna and of the Cultusministerium in Berlin. He called his work Aruch Completum or 'Aruk ha-Shalem, and its production occupied twenty-five years of his life. The first four volumes were printed during his residence in Hungary, and the last four during his sojourn in America, covering a period of fourteen years (Vienna, 1878‚Äì92); the supplement appearing from a New York press; and the whole work aggregating more than 4,000 double-column pages. Seven manuscripts of the 'Aruk were used by the editor in determining the etymology of the words, and countless doubtful and corrupted passages in the Talmud were thus corrected and restored. Kohut identified in an elaborate special study (printed in the supplement) the often unacknowledged sources of Nathan ben Jehiel's information, though everywhere defending him against the charge of plagiarism. The 'Aruk has been justly characterized as one of the monuments of Hebrew literature. In 1880 Kohut was called to Oradea, Hungary, where he remained until 1884. While there he published (1881) A Zsid√≥k T√∂rt√©nete. A Biblia Befejez√©s√©t≈ël a Jelenkorig (introduced into many schools in Hungary as a text-book), and translated the entire Bible into Hungarian. Part of the manuscript was, however, lost, and the work never appeared in print. At Oradea he became acquainted with K√°lm√°n Tisza, prime minister of Hungary, who, hearing him speak at a national gathering of notables, was so carried away by his eloquence that he caused him to be called to the Hungarian parliament as representative of the Jews. In 1885 Kohut was elected rabbi of Congregation Ahavath Chesed in New York. His arrival in the U.S. was the signal for rallying the conservative forces of American Jewry; and it was not long before he was bitterly assailed by the radical wing. A series of lectures on Ethics of the Fathers, only the first part of which was printed in book form (New York, 1885), clearly set forth his conservatism; and so marked was this attitude and the influence it had upon the public mind that the leaders of Reform felt called upon to institute the memorable Pittsburg Conference, to accentuate their own advanced views and their independence of the historic traditions of the past.  New York  Kohut was associated with the Rev. Sabato Morais in founding the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York, becoming one of its advisory board, and being active as professor of Talmudic methodology up to the time of his death. In 1889, on the occasion of his finishing the Aruch Completum, he was the recipient of many honors, notably at the hands of various learned bodies in Europe. In 1891 he was appointed examiner in rabbinics at Columbia College. In March, 1894, while delivering a stirring eulogy on Lajos Kossuth, he was stricken in his pulpit, and, after lingering a few weeks, expired on the eve of the Sabbath (25 May 1894). His widow was his second wife, Jewish women's leader Rebekah Bettelheim Kohut.\\"Mrs. Rebekah Kohut\\" The American Jewess 1(2)(May 1895): 82-83. A volume containing memorial addresses and tributes was published by Congregation Ahavath Chesed in 1894 in New York; and another, containing learned essays by forty-four noted scholars in Europe and America, entitled Semitic Studies in Memory of Rev. Dr. Alexander Kohut, was published in Berlin in 1897 by his son, G. A. Kohut. The latter work contains a memoir of Kohut's life written by his brother, Dr. Adolph Kohut. A complete list of Kohut's published writings has been compiled by G. A. Kohut, in the appendix to the Proceedings of the Fourth Biennial Convention of the Jewish Theological Seminary Association (New York, 1894) and in Tributes to the Memory of Rev. Dr. Alexander Kohut, pp. 49‚Äì64 (ib. 1894). His son, George Alexander Kohut, often known as \\"G. A. Kohut,\\" was an American writer and bibliographer, who donated his father's important library of Judaica to Yale University in 1915. This established the \\"Alexander Kohut Memorial Collection\\". The son also created the \\"Kohut Endowment\\" to maintain and improve the Yale collection.George Alexander Kohut (1874-1933) library.yale.edu  Notes   References  *  External links  * Category:1842 births Category:1894 deaths Category:People from Kiskunf√©legyh√°za Category:Hungarian rabbis Category:19th-century rabbis Category:19th-century American people Category:American Conservative rabbis Category:American Reform rabbis Category:Jewish Theological Seminary of America people Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:Hungarian expatriates in Germany Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Lexicographers ","title":"Alexander Kohut"},{"id":"2433339","text":"Hayes Edward \\"Big Ed\\" Sanders (March 24, 1930 ‚Äì December 12, 1954) was an American heavyweight boxer who won an Olympic gold medal in 1952.Ed Sanders. sports-reference.com Personal Sanders was the oldest male child of the family. His older sister, Winifred, died in a Scarlet Fever epidemic, in 1939. As a child, Sanders was very large for his age and physically strong. At age 12, he was recollected to be the size of a normal 18 year old. Sanders and his younger brother, Donald, collected coffee cans, filled them with cement and connected two of them with a steel bar to make a weight set for exercising. As \\"Big Ed\\" grew bigger, faster and stronger, Sanders excelled in football and track and field at Jordan High School. Outside of the ring, Sanders was known as affable, gentlemanly and highly intelligent. On 11 December 1954, he faced Willie James for the New England heavyweight title. James knocked out Sanders in the 11th round and Sanders had to be carried from the ring. He never regained consciousness and died 18 hours later. On May 26, 2012, Sanders' son Russell presided over his posthumous induction into the Compton Community College Athletics Hall of Fame, under the category of boxing. He also was inducted into the Idaho State University Athletic Hall of Fame. Early life After graduating from Jordan High School, Sanders attended Compton College, where he again excelled in football and a new sport, boxing. In 1950, at the National Junior College Boxing Championships in Ogden, Utah, the six-foot four-inch, 220 pound Sanders attracted the attention of Idaho State College boxing coach Dubby Holt and football coach Babe Caccia. \\"He had a good left hand, and for the big man that he was, he was a real orthodox, skilled boxer,\\" Holt recalled. Shortly thereafter, Sanders was awarded an athletic scholarship to Idaho State College (now Idaho State University) in Pocatello, Idaho, where he boxed and played football. Sanders flourished at nearly all-white Idaho State. In his first collegiate bout, Sanders knocked out the Pacific Coast Heavyweight Champion. Sanders also set a record by never losing a bout in a collegiate dual meet. While attending Idaho State, Sanders fell in love with Pocatellan Mary LaRue, who was then a secretary at Idaho State's athletic department. She later became his wife. Amateur career In 1951, Sanders was drafted into the U.S. Army to fight in the Korean War, but was convinced to join the Navy by his coaches. He then continued his boxing career as part of the U.S. Navy Boxing Team under G.E. ‚ÄúMoose‚Äù Detty. Sanders scored a string of major victories when he defeated the Navy Heavyweight Champion, Kirby Seals, in San Diego, California and won both the Los Angeles Golden Gloves and Chicago Golden Gloves Tournaments. He subsequently toured Europe, winning the Golden Gloves Tournament in Berlin, Germany, which enhanced his reputation as a dominant heavyweight. Upon his return to the United States, Sanders trained at Naval facilities in Maryland for his dream‚Äîthe Olympics. =Olympics= The Olympics, once a faraway dream, were suddenly within Sanders‚Äô grasp, but the Olympic trials loomed as a major test, as stiff competition from around the country vied for the few coveted U.S Team spots. In the Mid-West Regional in Omaha, Nebraska, Sanders was defeated by Army Corporal Lloyd Willis, but still advanced to the finals because of his prior victory over Navy Champion Seals. Sanders and Willis met again in a bout in Kansas City, Missouri that decided the last spot on the Olympic boxing team. With a broken hand, Sanders knocked out Willis, dropping him with a smashing left hook in only one minute. The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki turned out not to be much of a challenge for Sanders, as he knocked out his first three opponents and reached the final against Swede Ingemar Johansson. Their match was unremarkable. For the entire first round, Johansson avoided Sanders by circling along the edges of the ring. The crowd, growing impatient, called for Johansson to fight. In the second round, Johansson continued the same strategy. Finally, in the third minute of the second round, Johansson was disqualified for failure to fight by the referee. Johansson was ushered from the ring between policemen, and was subsequently refused the silver medal. Sanders later stood atop the prize dais with the place for the silver medallist vacant and a Swedish flag in its unfurled knot. Johansson maintained he was not fleeing Sanders, but rather was trying to tire his huge opponent for a planned third round onslaught but he was not awarded his silver medal for another 30 years.Boxing at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Games: Men's Heavyweight . sports-reference.comIngemar Johansson: Boxer who beat Floyd Patterson to win the world heavyweight title. The Independent (February 3, 2009) Sanders, the first African American Olympic Heavyweight Champion and the first American to win gold in the division since 1904, returned to the United States a national hero. The combination of his tenacious fighting style, deep sense of assurance and humble demeanor attracted constant media attention. The City of Los Angeles named a day in his honor, and he was inundated with requests for his attendance at athletic, social and religious events. After the Olympics, Sanders‚Äô amateur status became a burden on his ability to provide for his wife and young son, Russell, who was born in 1953. Sanders‚Äô Naval commitments took him to San Diego, where he trained with mentor and close friend Moose Detty. Sanders was transferred subsequently to Maryland and then Boston, where he rented a flat with his wife and son. As a Navy man, Sanders was prevented from boxing professionally, so he continued to box in the amateur ranks. Sanders reentered the 1953 Gold Gloves Tournament and fought future World Heavyweight Champion Sonny Liston in the 1953 Chicago Golden Gloves Championship fight. Sanders entered the fight with a broken thumb, which hampered what was still considered a good performance. Liston emerged victorious, though witnesses at the fight accused Liston of clutching Sanders illegally, and still others in the audience felt Sanders won the fight. Sanders was invited again to the Intercity Golden Gloves Tournament but turned down the opportunity due to the thumb injury. Sanders ended his amateur career with a record of 43 wins and only 4 losses. Pro career After the Olympic victory, Sanders‚Äô pro career became an intriguing prospect, but Sanders was still in the Navy, which did not allow active duty personnel to box professionally. Additionally, Sanders, now living near a Naval base in Boston, lacked a consistent trainer and heavyweight sparring partners. Sanders set out to become Heavyweight Champion. Sanders turned to many people for advice, including his Navy Captain. Sanders primary confidante was Detty, who in letters cautioned against turning pro. Though Sanders was an Olympic champion, he had only been boxing for 4 years and needed more seasoning before turning pro. Sanders, famous and holding a prized Olympic gold medal, faced immense pressure to turn pro from the boxing world and media. Sanders also needed to provide financially for his wife, Mary, and infant son, Russell. Sanders tried desperately but failed to obtain a discharge from the Navy, which considered him committed until at least 1955. Still, Sanders lacked experience. On June 17, 1954, Sanders attended the Rocky Marciano-Ezzard Charles fight in New York as a guest of the International Boxing Council, which courted Sanders heavily. Earlier that same day, Sanders attended a game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves and witnessed Jackie Robinson hit two home runs. Sanders turned pro in February 1953, suspiciously acting as his own manager to satisfy Naval requirements. Sanders‚Äô IBC advisors, Truman Gibson, Nuno Cam, Sam Silverman, Frankie Carbo and Johnny Dundee, were all allegedly connected to the boxing underworld - strange bedfellows for a man like Sanders, but perhaps unavoidable for success in boxing in Boston 1953‚Äì54. Sanders‚Äô first pro fight took place on March 8, 1954 against Sonny Nichols, with Sanders winning in a first-round TKO. Sanders won his next two fights by knockout before being stunned in a five-round decision loss to Willie Wilson. In private correspondence to Detty, a shocked and saddened Sanders confided that he felt he lacked adequate trades and sparring partners other than highly regarded local heavyweight Willie James. Sanders also complained about intense shoulder pain, and mentioned in letters that it had been x-rayed. Sanders won a May 22, 1954 bout against Jack Flood and then avenged his earlier loss to Willie Wilson later that summer in August 1954, winning an eight-round decision. On October 5, 1954, Sanders fought to a draw with Bert Whitehurst. Sanders and Whitehurst fought a rematch only three weeks later on October 26, 1954, with Sanders winning a ten-round unanimous decision. Concluding a turbulent year, Sanders fought eight professional fights within only nine months, losing two fights in close decisions. =Last fight and death= On Saturday, December 11, 1954, Sanders fought his sparring partner Willie James, the New England Heavyweight Champion at Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The fight was his last. James was a highly regarded heavyweight who in February 1954 had performed well in sparring matches against Sanders. Sanders, who had complained previously of headaches and had his shoulder X-rayed just a few weeks prior, was uncharacteristically listless in the opinion of some observers. James and Sanders traded heavy blows for ten rounds. In the eleventh round, Sanders appeared \\"tired\\", in James‚Äô estimation, and was felled by a simple punch combination. Sanders dropped to the canvas and lost consciousness immediately, breathing laboriously while lying on his side. Ring personnel carried him out of the ring by stretcher. Sanders never regained consciousness and died after a long surgery to relieve pressure on the brain. The coroner concluded that Sanders likely aggravated a previous injury. Doctors and trainers concluded Sanders probably suffered a prior injury that was aggravated in the James fight. Sanders was laid to rest at Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica, California, after a 21-gun military salute.

The story is told out of chronological order but mostly follows the upper-class Englishman Adrian Healey through his years at public school, at Cambridge University, and afterwards. He excels at lying and entire chapters are later revealed to have been fictions. He ultimately ends up teaching at Cambridge as part of an old boys' club in British intelligence, which alleviates its boredom during the decline of the empire and end of the Cold War by partaking in make-believe espionage missions. Plot The book opens as the protagonist, Adrian Healey, and his mentor, Professor Donald Trefusis, are at Mozart's birthplace in Salzburg, where Adrian witnesses the (staged) murder of their contact. The narrative then shifts to Adrian's time at public school, where he has carefully groomed himself to convey the image of a witty, highly extroverted young gay man; however, despite his image, and, despite regarding sex as his \\"public pride\\",Page 18 he finds himself unable to express his love for the beautiful Hugo Cartwright. Another student, Paul Trotter (known as \\"Pigs Trotter\\" [sic]) hangs himself due to his unrequited love for Adrian. Adrian is shown later in the novel to be touchy on the subject of suicide as a result. Prior to Trotter's funeral, Adrian has a sexual encounter with Hugo while pretending to be asleep. Adrian is later expelled from school for writing an article discussing the tradition of hidden behaviours that could be considered homosexual at public schools; consequently, he takes his A-level examinations in a Gloucestershire state school. Adrian claims to have run away from home due to unhappiness, subsequently becoming a rent boy, but it is later revealed, in an overheard conversation, that this probably never occurred. Eventually, Adrian takes on the role of schoolmaster and has his first sexual encounter with a woman, a fellow member of staff at the school. The school years finish with Adrian's cricket team defeating the team of Hugo Cartwright, to whom Adrian no longer feels attracted. Just as Adrian and his team are about to leave the school at which Hugo is a master he admits to Hugo that he was awake during the incident before Trotter's funeral. Adrian attends the fictional St. Matthew's College, Cambridge and is given a challenge to produce something original by his tutor Professor Donald Trefusis. With the aid of his girlfriend ‚Äì and later wife and acclaimed producer ‚Äì Jenny de Woolf, and his housemate Gary, he writes and claims to have discovered a lost manuscript by Charles Dickens which dealt with the child sex trade. The discovery brings Jenny and the college fame, but it also results in a dialogue between Adrian and Hugo, who has become an alcoholic. Hugo believes that Adrian hates him, and points to Adrian's duplicity as proof. Adrian corrects him and the two leave things on a friendly note. After graduation, Adrian attends a farcical meeting where he and other attendees discuss the arrest of Trefusis, who was arrested on charges of cottaging, sabotaging the footage of an onlooking BBC film crew. It is later revealed that he was actually undertaking a document exchange preceded by two kisses on the cheek as is custom in several European countries, such as Hungary. Adrian joins Trefusis in a forced sabbatical, which they claim to spend studying the fricative shift in English. In actuality, the year is spent in a game of espionage in which they must acquire the parts for Mendax (from the Latin adjective meaning \\"lying, deceptive\\"), a lie-inhibiting device from his Hungarian friend Szab√≥. A showdown results with Adrian's uncle David (Sir David Pearce of MI5) and Trefusis, during which it is revealed that Pearce's aide was a double agent working for Trefusis. It is also revealed that the murders that Adrian witnessed were staged to scare Trefusis into giving Mendax to MI5, and that Mendax was fictional. Subsequently Adrian overhears a conversation between Trefusis and Pearce where it is revealed that the espionage adventure was just a game to counter boredom, meaning that several parts of the story were untrue. Adrian remembers a letter written to him by de Woolf saying that while young girls grew up, young boys did not, making their education irrelevant and just a game. The book concludes with Adrian, now a Cambridge fellow, recruiting a new spy for a new game. Autobiographical elements The novel is semi-autobiographical and many scenes echo experiences later recounted in Fry's memoir, Moab is My Washpot.Kakutani, Michiko. \\"BOOKS OF THE TIMES ‚Äì A Rebellious Young Weed, and How He Grew\\", The New York Times, 11 June 1999. Retrieved on 25 May 2013. The character Trefusis was created by Fry for several humorous radio broadcasts on BBC Radio 4's Loose Ends. Conceits The espionage portions of the book are written in italics, which stop at Adrian's graduation. The book features a third-person omniscient narrator. The narrator knows, for example, about David Pearce's annoyance at Dickon Lister's ignorance of the story of Helen of Troy. Starting with chapter four, in keeping with popular spy fiction, the characters refer to each other by code names; in this case, the names used are from the Trojan War: * Adrian is \\"Telemachus\\", the name of the son of Odysseus in the Odyssey * Professor Donald Trefusis is \\"Odysseus\\" * Istvan Moltaj is \\"Patrochlus\\" (sic, in Greek Œ†Œ¨œÑœÅŒøŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ, not Œ†Œ¨œÑœÅŒøœáŒªŒøœÇ) * Szab√≥ is \\"Helen\\", the catalyst of the Trojan war (pronounced rather than on the audiobook) * His nephews are \\"Castor\\" and \\"Pollux\\" * Salzburg is the \\"walls of Illium\\" The author is renowned for his interest in the English language (see Fry's Planet Word). In a post on his blog,Fry, Stephen. \\"Don‚Äôt Mind Your Language...\\", stephenfry.com, 4 November 2008. Retrieved on 25 May 2013. Fry talks about the evolving language, including his interest in \\"verbing\\" nouns (nouns used as verbs). He also reproaches grammar pedants. In the book there are several experiments with the English language, mostly used in the dialogue. These range from several nouns used as verbs (e.g. \\"You everything me\\" or \\"you sir me\\"), Americanisms (e.g. \\"burglarised\\" or \\"gotten\\") to polysyndeton (e.g. \\"Tom and Adrian and Pigs Trotter\\"Page 37). In the book, at school, Adrian actively tries new vocabulary.Page 37 As a spy he is told off by Trefusis for saying \\"it is them\\" instead of \\"it is they\\" (before Trefusis acknowledges that it is obnoxious pedantry to care) and complains to Trefusis about the habit of another (less erudite) character of overusing the suffix \\"-ise\\" like an American.page 219: \\"God knows what new linguistic mac√©-doine he's going to serve up next\\" Reception The book is noted for its wit and humour, as well as its often outrageous references to various homosexual experiences. The book also has an unreliable narrator: Adrian is 'the liar' and lies habitually to other characters; accordingly, in the book, whole chapters are later revealed to be fictitious, though the reader has no prior warning. This manner of sudden revelation occurs at various points throughout the book, placing respectable characters in scandalous situations and juxtaposing humour and triviality with darker themes. Legacy The bar on level 3 of the University of Dundee Student Union building is named after the book, as Fry was Rector of the university from 1992 to 1998.

It is commonly used on devices such as combination locks, where there is no natural access (such as a keyhole) for a tool to reach the locking mechanism. Because the mechanism itself is not being manipulated, this could technically not be considered lockpicking at all. However, it does fall under the repertoire of techniques used to open locks. Lock bypass is one of the most important parts of locksmithing, especially with respect to public buildings which must be able to be opened from inside in case of fire, thus allowing the use of \\"letter box tools\\" among other techniques. Locks may be bypassed by a variety of other techniques including loiding, i.e. the \\"credit card\\" technique, against self-closing \\"latch systems.\\" Padlocks may be bypassed by shimming, where one inserts a sprung steel device to retract the spring-loaded catch that restrains the shackle. Locked cars may be bypassed by introducing a stiff wire between the door and the cars structure to operate internal unlocking catches. The previous method may be assisted by gently prying the door from the frame with an air wedge or lever. To avoid bypass, a door should be secured using a deadbolt system, in which the locking mechanism and bolt are operated by the key. This prevents the device from being opened without the locking mechanism itself being properly operated.

Route description Its northern terminus is U.S. Route 59 just east of Atchison, Kansas where 59 turns sharply to St. Joseph, Missouri north while 45 heads south towards Kansas City, Missouri. It overlaps Route 273 until just south of Weston, Missouri where 273 breaks off to head east. At Beverly, Missouri, in what is referred to locally as the \\"Beverly Curve\\", it intersects Route 92 going east to Platte City, Missouri and west to Leavenworth, Kansas. About three miles (5 km) later at East Leavenworth, Missouri, Route 45 intersects its spur which goes northwest to Leavenworth. The spur, which is signed as \\"Route 45\\" and also known as the \\"Leavenworth cutoff\\", was built as a shortcut from Leavenworth, Kansas to Kansas City during the construction of the Centennial Bridge (Leavenworth, Kansas). Even though it is in Missouri it was maintained by the city of Leavenworth until the tolls were removed from the Centennial Bridge in May 1977. This is now maintained by MODOT. The length of the highway between the convergence of the spur and the intersection with I-435 to the south was quite narrow, each lane being less than 11 feet wide. In addition, there were large ruts just off the edges of the highway in some areas. This width shrank even more over the Platte River bridge just south of Farley, which was finally replaced after 79 years‚Äîthe original bridge was built in 1933 and the replacement bridge (built just to the east of the old bridge) was completed in 2012. Recent construction in the spring months of 2013 has widened the road and eliminated the danger of ruts, although as of May 2013, there has not been a change in the painted lanes. South of Farley, Missouri, the road leaves the Missouri River bottoms and heads southeast past Interstate 435. The section between Interstate 435 and Interstate 29 that passes the National Golf Club of Kansas City is named the Tom Watson Parkway after the Kansas City native champion golfer who also designed the club's course. At the intersection with Route 9, the road widens to become a four-lane concrete avenue. The road's southern terminal point is Interstate 29. The road, which is almost exclusively rural until entering Kansas City suburban development east of I-435, is frequently listed as a \\"scenic route\\" as it stays close to the Missouri River bluffs and has commanding views of Fort Leavenworth.

The proceedings began the next day. Staff Sergeant McKeon was initially represented by a Marine Corps attorney; on Saturday, the 14th, his brother-in-law, Thomas P. Costello, stepped in as his personal legal counsel. Costello was assisted by another New York lawyer, Jim McGarry, and by Lieutenant Jeremiah Collins, as Marine-Corps-designated defense counsel.Court of Inquiry transcript, at p. 155; see also ‚Äò‚ÄôCounsel for the Accused Marine Corps Drill Sergeant, Marie Costello Inserra‚Äò‚Äô, 2016, at p. 36 There had been no specific prohibition against entering the creek, as Colonel McKean (who had ordered the Drill Instructors initial confinement)¬ß noted in his memoir, Ribbon Creek.New York: The Dial Press, 1958 at p. 113, see also Counsel for the Accused Marine Corps Drill Sergeant, Marie Costello Inserra, 2016, at p. 73 and Court of Inquiry transcript at p. 226. When asked by counsel for the defense, Mr. Costello, whether there were any orders that prohibited using the marshes and swamp areas for training exercises, Colonel McKean answered: \\"....To the best of my knowledge the only order that relates to swamps has to do with marching down around the area of Elliot's Beach ...\\"Court of Inquiry transcript at p. 226 During the proceedings, Costello established that night marches were common exercises.Court of Inquiry at pp. 331‚Äì336 In his memoir, Ribbon Creek, McKean wrote that General \\"Burger's efforts to deny the practice of night marches into swamps becomes ludicrous[,] when we analyze the argument of his ghost writer, Major Faw.\\" McKean confirmed this practice by asking about eighteen Marines assisting in the search of Ribbon Creek that night if they had ever marched into the swamps at night; his answer had been that a \\"clear majority\\" of them had done so.Ribbon Creek; New York: The Dial Press, 1958 at pp. 229‚Äì230 The Court of Inquiry resulted in four charges, including possessing alcohol on base (as was shown by McKeon having a drink there at about noon), as well as the serious charges of oppressing his troops and involuntary manslaughter. McKeon was also charged with drinking in front of a recruit, but he was acquitted of that, and also of the more serious charges. He was, however, found guilty of negligent homicide.1956 Decision of Secretary of the Navy, Charles S. Thomas; see also, Counsel for the Accused Marine Corps Drill Sergeant, Marie Costello Inserra, 2016, at pp. xiii and 204 Staff Sergeant McKeon was brought before the court the following day. At first, he was classified as mentally and \\"emotionally stable\\" and \\"a mature, stable appearing career Marine.\\" The Court of Inquiry did decide that the detailed directives regarding and prohibiting certain Marine training methods were \\"correct and adequate\\" and that McKeon had launched an unnecessary and unauthorized disciplinary action. It was proven that McKeon had consumed several alcoholic drinks the afternoon before the night march, but it was confirmed that he was not under the influence of alcohol when he led the recruits into the creek. The recommendation was that McKeon be subject to a court-martial. Consequences Staff Sergeant McKeon was court-martialed amidst a wave of public condemnation over the \\"brutality\\" of Marine Corps training. However, many Marines came to his defense, pointing out such harsh training was necessary to survive in combat. McKeon's supervisor, Staff Sergeant E. H. Huff, testified in his defense. He described McKeon an outstanding drill instructor and noted that night marches were very common at Parris Island. Huff said the discipline in his own platoon was so poor that he would have taken the recruits on the march himself if he had had the time. McKeon was defended by a group of volunteer lawyers from New York City, including his brother-in-law, Thomas P. Costello, Emile Zola Berman, and Howard Lester. along with Marine Corps attorneys Lieutenant Colonel Alaric W. Valentin, Major John R. DeBarr, and Lieutenant Collins.Trial transcript p. 2 Berman led the team, as he was a distinguished and successful trial attorney who specialized in negligence cases, but he was also dedicated to preserving the constitutional rights of the criminally accused. He had previously presented a successful criminal defense in 1954 in Alexandria, Louisiana, of a 14-year-old African-American charged with rape and would later go on to defend Sirhan Sirhan.New York Times, July 5, 1981, Emile Zola Berman, 78, Dead; Defense Attorney for Sirhan Berman put on a vigorous defense that swayed both the court and public opinion. Marine Corps Commandant General Randolph Pate testified. One reporter pointed out this was like \\"calling J. Edgar Hoover to testify about a problem within the FBI\\". The trial's most dramatic moment, however, was the arrival of General Lewis \\"Chesty\\" Puller, the most decorated Marine in the history of the Corps. Berman called Puller to testify about training methods. Puller called the incident in Ribbon Creek \\"a deplorable accident\\", but one that did not warrant court-martial. He said that discipline was the most important factor in military training. He quoted Napoleon, saying that an army becomes a \\"mob\\" without it. He mentioned his experiences in the Korean War and that one of the reasons troops failed was because of lack of night training. General Puller felt that the press had blown the incident out of proportion because of prejudice they had against the Marine Corps. He mentioned a similar accident at an Army post in which ten soldiers drowned and pointed out that none of their superiors had been charged and that it had never made headlines the way Ribbon Creek had. Staff Sergeant McKeon was finally acquitted of manslaughter and oppression of his troops, but was found guilty of negligent homicide and drinking on duty. The Secretary of the Navy, Charles S. Thomas, noted in his final action on the case: > The members of the court-martial, acting in their capacity of the equivalent > to jurors in civil courts, acquitted the accused not only of all intentional > or willful misconduct toward the men under his command, but acquitted him > also of 'culpable' negligence with respect to the loss of life. If the > accused had been found guilty of either of these two much more serious types > of misconduct, i.e., 'oppression' or 'culpable' negligence, a reduction in > the sentence would not be deserved, and would condone such serious > misconduct. On the basis of the court's findings, however, this case > presents to me the problem of adjudging an appropriate sentence for 'simple' > negligence, which is not generally regarded by law or society as nearly so > blameworthy as the much more serious types of misconduct classified as > culpable negligence or intentional misconduct ..... Simple negligence is not > 'bad conduct' in the normal meaning of the term 'bad', nor in the military > connotation of that term. A bad conduct discharge therefore appears > inappropriate in that respect. \\"In reducing the sentence and allowing > Sergeant McKeon to stay in the Corps, Secretary Thomas asked if a bad > conduct discharge was appropriate \\"under the circumstances of the principal > offense for which he was convicted, which is negligent homicide based upon > simple negligence.\\"1956 Decision of the Secretary of the Navy Charles S. > Thomas on the appeal from the court martial of Sergeant McKeon. Secretary > Thomas further noted the following: \\"There is no question in my mind that > his entire record prior to 8 April 1956 indicated that Sergeant McKeon was a > capable non-commissioned officer, dedicated to the United States Marine > Corps. More than that, the testimony pictures him as a good man, sincere, > and of a sympathetic nature. He has always attended church regularly.

For all the foregoing reasons, I have > determined that the bad conduct discharge should be remitted.1956 Decision > of the Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas on the appeal of the court > martial of Sergeant McKeon. Thomas reduced the sentence, remitted the bad conduct discharge and allowed McKeon to remain in the Corps with the reduced rank of private. Prior to the reduction, his sentence was a $270 fine, 9 months of confinement at hard labor, rank reduction to private and a bad conduct discharge. The Secretary of the Navy eventually reduced the sentence to three months in the brig and reduction to private, but with no discharge or fine. McKeon then returned to active duty, but never regained his former rank and was medically retired in 1959 as a corporal because of a back injury. He then worked as an inspector of Standards for his home state of Massachusetts. In a 1970 Newsweek interview, McKeon told of his lifelong burden of guilt and how he prayed every day to keep the dead recruits in His safekeeping and for his own forgiveness. McKeon died on November 11, 2003, at the age of 79. = Published works = John C. Stevens researched the night march and subsequent court-martial and wrote a book called Court Martial At Parris Island. He was able to interview many of McKeon's recruits. Stevens pointed out that with one exception, all of them spoke in favorable terms about their former drill instructor. They claimed he was not the sadist portrayed by the prosecution. Marie Costello Inserra, daughter of Thomas P. Costello, became an attorney and was admitted to practice law in New York in 1988 and North Carolina since 2006. She also wrote a book called Counsel for the Accused Marine Corps Drill Sergeant. It is largely based upon the transcripts of the court of inquiry, the trial, her father's diary and conversations with her father. = Training changes = The incident led to several changes in Marine Corps recruit training, following reforms that had begun in the early 1950s in the wake of the Korean War and the sudden large influx of recruits into the Corps. Recruit Training Commands,RTC commanded by brigadier generals directly appointed by and answering to the Commandant, were established at both Parris Island and MCRD San Diego. Within the commands, officers were selected to oversee recruit training down to the series level. New drill instructor schools were established within each command, and drill instructors (DIs) were more carefully selected. The number of DIs assigned to each platoon was increased from two to three and the role of the DI was reformed to emphasize example, leadership, persuasion and psychology in the process of recruit training. The Special Training CompanySTC was also established to provide remedial training to recruits needing additional physical conditioning, motivation or education, and rehabilitation to recruits suffering from medical conditions. The campaign hat was introduced as a distinctive element of DI dress, in part to recognize a new norm of professionalism and specialization within the DI billet and also to signify a break from the \\"old\\" era of recruit training and the \\"new\\". The changes in Marine Corps training that occurred as a result of the Ribbon Creek tragedy are documented in a historical analysis written by Keith Fleming entitled The U.S. Marine Corps in Crisis Ribbon Creek and Recruit Training, University of South Carolina Press, 1990. Public opinion and media coverage The incident was the subject of significant media coverage. Several publications, including Time magazine reported thoroughly on the development of the trial. The trial was covered by every national and many local newspapers. Jim Bishop, a syndicated columnist and author of books such as The Day Lincoln was Shot and A Day in the Life of President Kennedy, among many others, also wrote extensively in his syndicated column about the entire trial and the Marine Corps. Jim Bishop's columns on this trial and other significant events that he covered appear in a collection entitled Jim Bishop: Reporter (Random House 1966). Additionally, the United States Congress launched its own investigation. The 1957 film The D.I., directed and starring Jack Webb as the title character, may have been made to provide the US Marine Corps's view on the need for high pressure basic training. The film was written by James Lee Barrett and based on his teleplay for Kraft Television Theatre, Murder of a Sand Flea.

The Christian Research Institute (CRI) is an evangelical Christian apologetics ministry.Walter Martin, \\"Christian Research Institute,\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 14, number 1 October 1970, pp. 15-18.www.equip.org, Christian Research Institute official web site It was established in October 1960 in the state of New Jersey by Walter Martin (1928‚Äì1989).Douglas E. Cowan, Bearing False Witness? An Introduction to the Christian Countercult, Westport: Praeger, 2003, p. 102. In 1974 Martin relocated the ministry to San Juan Capistrano, California.\\"Christian Research Institute\\" in Peter D. Dresser ed. Research Centers Directory, 12th ed, Volume 2 Detroit: Gale Research, 1988, p. 1193. The ministry's office was relocated in the 1990s near Rancho Santa Margarita. In 2005 the organization moved to its present location in Charlotte, North Carolina. Background The establishment of CRI in 1960 is closely linked to Walter Martin. It represents one of the pioneering organizations in what is called the Christian countercult movement, but also relates to the wider history of Evangelical Christian apologetics in the mid-Twentieth century.J. Gordon Melton, \\"The counter-cult monitoring movement in historical perspective,\\" in Challenging Religion: Essays in Honour of Eileen Barker, edited by James A. Beckford & James T. Richardson, Routledge, London, 2003, pp. 102-113. Martin is considered one of the first full-time career apologists to have specialized in Christian countercult apologetics.Douglas Groothuis, \\"Walter R. Martin\\" in Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions, ed. A. Scott Moreau, Grand rapids: Baker Books, 2000, p. 601. In 1949 Martin began his forays into the theological analysis of various groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Science, Mormonism and Spiritualism. Much of this early work coincided with his tertiary studies at Shelton College and New York University during the 1950s. In 1953 Martin became acquainted with the Presbyterian radio Bible teacher Donald Grey Barnhouse.Margaret N. Barnhouse, That Man Barnhouse, Wheaton: Tyndale House, 1983, p. 283. Barnhouse was the founding editor (1950) of the monthly periodical Eternity magazine.C. Allyn Russell, \\"Donald Grey Barnhouse: Fundamentalist Who Changed\\" Journal of Presbyterian History, Volume 59, number 1 Spring 1981, pp. 33-57. Stephen Board, in his study of the history of evangelical periodicals, has observed that during its first decade of publishing Eternity was built around Barnhouse's personality and his own particular causes.Stephen Board, \\"Moving the World With Magazines: A Survey of Evangelical Periodicals\\" in American Evangelicals and the Mass Media, ed. Quentin J. Schultze, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1990, p. 123. In 1954 Barnhouse invited Martin to be a columnist in Eternity magazine, and then between 1955 and 1960 Martin served as a regular contributing editor. Martin wrote a number of articles about cults, which formed the embryonic texts for various books he wrote. However, Martin also wrote book reviews, examined general apologetics and doctrinal issues, and also considered social questions such as alcoholism. The early 1950s witnessed the publication of several books that Martin wrote, or co-wrote with Norman Klann, such as Jehovah of the Watchtower (1953), The Christian Science Myth (1954), The Rise of the Cults (1955) and The Christian and the Cults (1956). Barnhouse wrote the foreword to The Christian Science Myth, and his support for Martin's ministry was crucial in legitimating countercult apologetics to the wider church constituency.Barnhouse, That Man Barnhouse, pp.224-225 In 1960 Barnhouse died from a brain tumour only a few weeks before Martin formally established CRI.The diagnosis, and Barnhouse's death are described in Barnhouse, That Man Barnhouse, pp.390-403. By that time Martin had become an emerging apologist whose ministry and reputation was gaining recognition in para-church organizations like the American Tract Society, Evangelical Theological Society, National Association of Evangelicals, and National Religious Broadcasters.\\"Dr. Walter R. Martin\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 13, number 4 April 1970, p.3. Early ministry development The basic charter for CRI began with the aim of serving as a bureau of information on cults, other religions, and Christian apologetics.Walter R. Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1965, pp. 352-353. Walter Martin subsequently gave this summary profile about CRI: \\"The Institute's purpose is to supply primary data on all the cults, and non-Christian missionary activities, both here and abroad. It is the function of this Institute to index the major cults and to supply resumes of their origin, history, and doctrines, with bibliographical material aimed at specifically evangelizing and refuting their respective teachings.\\"Walter R. Martin, Martin Speaks Out On The Cults, Ventura, California: Vision House, 1983, p.125. CRI was assisted by individual donors and by charitable grants from organisations like the Pew Foundation. CRI was administered by a Board of Directors that included Martin's brother-in-law Everett Jacobson.\\"Memorial Service for Dr Walter Martin\\" Christian Research Newsletter, Volume 2, Number 4 1989. In the early 1960s much of CRI's activities centered on Martin's itinerant preaching ministry in churches and with para-church organisations. Martin delivered seminars throughout North America on the problems churches and missionaries faced with cults. He utilised the emergence of audio-cassette tapes with several of his seminar presentations recorded and initially distributed by Bible Voice Inc in New Jersey and the Audio Bible Society in Pennsylvania (later through Vision House and finally by CRI itself). Martin also developed a profile on radio initially as a co-host of Barnhouse's Bible Study Hour, then as a regular panel guest on the Long John Nebel show in the 1960s. Martin then became the host of his own shows, The Bible Answer Man and Dateline Eternity. The shows became nationally syndicated and accelerated in popularity following the ministry's relocation to California.Dr. Walter R. Martin\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 13, number 4, April 1970, pp. 3-4. Martin sought to develop a library of resources on cults and apologetics, including books, audio files, and periodicals. He encouraged the development of a bureau of speakers associated with CRI, which in the 1960s included figures such as Walter Bjorck, Floyd Hamilton, James Bjornstad and Shildes Johnson.Contributors to Walter R. Martin ed. UFOs: Friend Foe or Fantasy, Wayne, New Jersey: Christian Research Institute, 1968, p. 1; Floyd E. Hamilton, The Basis of Christian Faith, 4th Rev. Ed.

Other prominent theologians who were affiliated with CRI included Harold O. J. BrownWalter R. Martin, \\"Christian Research Institute,\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 14, number 1, October 1970, p. 16. and John Warwick Montgomery.John Warwick Montgomery, Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ, Wayne, New Jersey: Christian Research Institute, 1969. The intention was to maintain a network of scholars involved in apologetics.Walter R. Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1965, pp.352-353Donald Tinder, \\"Evangelical Initiative: Fingertip Facts,\\" Christianity Today, 13 March 1970, p. 53. CRI produced various tracts about the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, distributed tapes, books and booklets by Martin, and initially ran a periodical in 1961-62 known as Religious Research Digest. In 1968 the ministry published a 26-page booklet UFO: Friend Foe or Fantasy.Walter R. Martin ed. UFOs: Friend Foe or Fantasy, Wayne, New Jersey: Christian Research Institute, 1968. In 1963 Martin conceived of the idea of creating a computer data bank of apologetics information. The concept was subsequently framed under the acronym SENT/EAST (Electronic Answering Search Technology).Walter Martin, \\"SENT/EAST: Electronic Answering Search Technology,\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 14 number 1 October 1970, pp. 3-6. In 1968 a symposium of scholars was convened in Austria where the plans for CRI's computerised apologetics data bank were presented in lectures by Martin and John Warwick Montgomery. Much of these details were reported in Christianity Today and then in Montgomery's book Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ.John Warwick Montgomery, \\"Automating Apologetics in Austria\\" Christianity Today, 8 November 1968, pp. 57-58; Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ, Wayne, New Jersey: Christian Research Institute, 1969.Tinder, \\"Evangelical Initiative\\" Christianity Today 13 March 1970, p. 53. Transfer to California In 1974 Martin left New Jersey and relocated to California, and this also entailed the transfer of CRI. In the early stages Martin was assisted by Bob and Gretchen Passantino as staff members in CRI.Walter Martin, \\"Foreword\\" in Robert Passantino and Gretchen Passantino, Answers to the Cultist at Your Door, Eugene, Oregon: Harvest House Publishers, 1981, p. 3. Also see Bob Passantino and Gretchen Passantino, Witch Hunt, Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1990, pp. 220-229. Martin also became part of the teaching faculty of the newly formed Melodyland School of Theology in Anaheim, where countercult apologetics was integrated into the curriculum and the 13,000 volumes of CRI's library was housed there.Richard Quebedeaux, The Worldly Evangelicals, San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1978, pp. 66-67. Later the ministry opened an office in El Toro, and then shifted to larger premises in Irvine. The upsurge of interest in Martin's work and CRI coincided with the Jesus People revolution, the counterculture, and the social conflicts over new cults in the 1970s.Quebedeaux, Worldly Evangelicals, p. 67. During the 1970s and 1980s a number of younger apologists were mentored by Martin through CRI and included Cal Beisner, Todd Ehrenborg, Craig Hawkins, Carole Hausmann, Kurt Van Gorden, John Weldon, George Mather, Paul Carden, Rich Poll, Robert M. Bowman, Jr., Kenneth Samples, and Elliot Miller.Many of these individuals are profiled in \\"Credits\\" in Walter R. Martin ed. The New Cults, Santa Ana, California: Vision House, 1980, pp. 409-410. Also see these authors' works citing their staff connections with CRI: Robert M. Bowman, Understanding Jehovah's Witnesses, Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1991, p. 9; Craig S. Hawkins, Witchcraft: Exploring the World of Wicca, Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1996, p. 229; Elliot Miller, A Crash Course on the New Age Movement, Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1989, p. 11. The profile of CRI increased with the widespread sales of Martin's book The Kingdom of the Cults (now in the vicinity of some 750,000 copies sold), his audio-tape albums, his radio ministry, and his appearances on national television. Martin was also involved in the establishment of the MA program in apologetics at the Simon Greenleaf School of Law (now Trinity Law School) in 1980.John Warwick Montgomery, \\"Foreword\\" in Engaging the Closed Mind,Dan Story, Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1999, p. 5 Martin taught there on cults and the occult throughout the 1980s, and was assisted from time to time by Bob and Gretchen Passantino. In 1977 CRI launched a new quarterly periodical called the Christian Research Institute Newsletter, which in 1978 was retitled Forward. Through this periodical analyses were published about such movements as Hare Krishna, Jonestown, Rajneesh, the New Age and Satanism. In 1983 CRI established the Instituto Crist√£o de Pesquisas (ICP), an affiliate ministry in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Founded by staff researcher Paul Carden, it was eventually led by Martin disciple Paulo Romeiro. In 1987 Forward was revamped as Christian Research Journal, which was initially devised as a tri-yearly publication. In 1990 the journal was enlarged in size and became a quarterly publication, and has since become a monthly periodical. The Christian Research Journal has won several awards of excellence from the Evangelical Press Association. The journal now covers a wider range of issues in addition to cults, such as general apologetics, ethical apologetics, world religions, and theological controversies. It also includes contributed essays by authors who are not staff members with CRI. Ministry post-1989 On June 26, 1989 Martin died at his home of a heart attack at age 60.\\"Walter Ralston Martin\\", Contemporary Authors, Volume 129, ed. Susan M. Trotsky, Detroit: Gale Research, 1990, p. 287.

Hank Hanegraaff succeeded Martin as the ministry's president. Both at the time of Martin's death and then in the immediate years to follow, a number of staff researchers associated with CRI began to emerge as authors of various countercult apologetics books. These authors included Richard Abanes,Richard Abanes, Journey into the Light: Exploring Near-Death Experiences, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1996. Robert M. Bowman,Robert M.

Controversies = Countercult apologetics = Due to the controversial nature of the Christian countercult movement, both Martin and CRI have been involved in various theological and social conflicts. During Martin's lifetime a variety of conflicts erupted between himself and various leaders of religious groups, but especially with Mormons. These clashes sometimes led to public debates and even a lawsuit filed by Martin for alleged defamation.Walter R. Martin, The Maze of Mormonism, Santa Ana: Vision House, 1978, pp. 196-197.\\"Walter R. Martin vs. Bruce A. Johnson and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\" 88 Cal.

For a short time in the late 1970s CRI and Martin were involved in a controversy over claims that apologists had located part of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which allegedly had been plagiarized from a novel by Solomon Spaulding. The case was argued in a book, Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? by Wayne Cowdrey, Howard Davis and Donald Scales.Wayne L. Cowdrey, Howard A. Davis & Donald R. Scales, Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? Santa Ana: Vision House, 1980.Walter R. Martin, The Maze of Mormonism, rev. ed. Santa Ana: Vision House, 1978, pp. 59-69. However, the case was seriously questioned by Christian apologists and Mormonism critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner in Did Spaulding Write the Book of Mormon? Jerald Tanner and Sandra Tanner, Did Spalding Write the Book of Mormon? Salt Lake City: Modern Microfilm Company, 1977. It was also rebutted by Mormon apologists Robert and Rosemary Brown in volume 2 of their series of books They Lie In Wait To Deceive.Robert L. Brown & Rosemary Brown, They Lie in Wait To Deceive, Volume 2, Mesa, Arizona: Brownsworth Publishing, 1986. Edward Plowman reported on the CRI claims in Christianity Today magazine in July 1977, and then in October 1977 updated his report with evidence that pointed to the collapse in credibility of the claims.Edward E. Plowman, \\"Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon?\\" Christianity Today 8 July 1977, pp. 32-34.Edward E. Plowman, \\"Mormon Manuscript Claims: Another Look,\\" Christianity Today 21 October 1977, pp. 38-39. A book entitled Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? - The Spalding Enigma (Concordia Publishing House, July 2005) attempts to revive the original argument. Co-authors Cowdrey, Davis, and Vanick attempt to show that Sidney Rigdon did in fact visit Pittsburgh, the last residence of Spalding, before 1820. A paper authored by LDS affiliated research group Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) devoted nearly 130 pages to review the 2005 book and its claims.Roper, Matthew (2005), ‚ÄúThe Mythical ‚ÄòManuscript Found‚Äô‚Äù , FARMS Review 17(2): 7-140 [link accessed 2007-09-05].

My purpose in reading this is not so much to respond to anyone, but to reassure....I have never been more deeply in love with the Lord Jesus Christ and his body the church.\\" CRI has defended the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of theosis in a video on the CRI website. Hanegraff's conversion has raised questions among evangelicals, who point to major differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelical Protestantism.

Ektara (, , , ; literally 'one-string', also called actara, iktar, ektar, yaktaro, gopichand, gopichant, gopijiantra, tun tuna) is a one-stringed musical instrument used in the traditional music of South Asia, and used in modern-day music of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. In origin the ektara was a regular string instrument of wandering bards and minstrels from India and is plucked with one finger. The ektara is a drone lute consisting of a gourd resonator covered with skin, through which a bamboo neck is inserted. Performance The ektƒÅrƒÅ player holds the instrument upright, gripping the neck just above the resonator and plucking the playing string or strings with the index finger of the same hand. If dancing, the player supports the gourd resonator with the other hand, in which clusters of small bells are carried, which sound while beating this hand against the gourd. Pressing the two halves of the neck together loosens the string, thus lowering its pitch. The modulation of the tone with each slight flexing of the neck gives the ektara its distinctive sound. There are no markings or measurements to indicate what pressure will produce what note, so the pressure is adjusted by ear. The various sizes of ektara are soprano, tenor, and bass. The bass ektara, sometimes called a dotara often has two strings (as literally implied by do, 'two'). Use The ektara is a common instrument in Baul music from Bengal. Some controversy has arisen in recent years over the adoption and alleged corruption of Baul music by popular bands and films in Bengal. It has become common to mix traditional instruments like the ektara with more modern sounds in an attempt to appeal to a wide audience, which according to Purna Das Baul is \\"destroying the true beauty\\" of Baul music. =Kirtan chanting= Parvathy Baul at Ruhaniyat mystic music festival, at Purana Qila, Delhi The ektara is commonly used in kirtan chanting, a Hindu devotional practice of singing the divine names and mantras in an ecstatic call and response format. The Ektara is used by Sadhus, or wandering holy men and for Sufi chanting, as well as by the Bauls of Bengal.

Life and career Albery was born in London. On leaving school Albery entered an architect's office, and started to write plays. His farce A Pretty Piece of Chiselling was given its first production by the Ingoldsby Club in 1864. After some failures, his adaptation, Dr Davy, was produced at the Lyceum Theatre, London (1866). His most successful piece, Two Roses, a comedy, was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1870, in which Sir Henry Irving made one of his earliest London successes as Digby Grant. The production ran for 300 performances. Albery was the author of a large number of other plays and adaptations, including Coquettes (1870); Pickwick, a four- act drama (based on Dickens's The Pickwick Papers (1871); The Pink Dominos (1877), a farce that ran for an extremely successful 555 performances and was one of a series of adaptations from the French which he made for the Criterion Theatre, where his wife, the actress Mary Moore (who after his death became Lady Wyndham (1861‚Äì1931)), played the leading parts; Jingle (a farcical version of Pickwick), produced at the Lyceum in 1878; and Oriana (with music by Frederic Clay). His one-act operetta, The Spectre Knight, with music by Alfred Cellier, ran as a companion piece to Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer and then H.M.S. Pinafore at the Opera Comique in 1878 and on tour. Albery also wrote a book called Where's the Cat? in 1880. Albery and Moore had three sons: Irving, who became a Conservative Member of Parliament, Bronson, a theatre director after whom the Albery Theatre is named, and Wyndham, a socialist activist.

This included operations investigating the German Wunderwaffe: the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. British intelligence received their first Polish report regarding the development of these weapons at Peenem√ºnde in 1943.FOOTNOTE: Regarding the \\"widespread conviction\\" and Wojew√≥dzki (pgs 18, 252) claim that : > Polish authorities in London received despatches and reports on the subject > of Peenem√ºnde as early as 1942, the archives of the VIth Bureau that remained in Polish hands after the war and which, as of 1984, were to be found complete in the Polish Underground Movement (1939-45) Study Trust in London. Among them is \\"not a single document from 1942 concerning the V-1 and the V-2, nor has any been entered in the day- book of the VIth Bureau\\", and the lack of documentation regarding the claim was confirmed by Colonel Protasewicz and Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Zielinski, head of the Bureau of Military Studies in the Home Army Intelligence in Warsaw 1943-44. Early reports Part of a V-2 rocket recovered from the Bug River after the war By the summer of 1941 Home Army intelligence began receiving reports from its field units regarding some kind of secret tests being carried out by the Germans on the island of Usedom in the Baltic Sea. A special \\"Bureau\\" was formed within intelligence group \\"Lombard\\", charged with espionage inside the 3rd Reich and the Polish areas incorporated into it after 1939, to investigate the matter and to coordinate future actions. Specialized scientific expertise was provided to the group by the engineer Antoni Kocjan, \\"Korona\\", a renowned pre-war glider constructor. Furthermore, as part of their operations the \\"Bureau\\" managed to recruit an Austrian Anti-Nazi, Roman Traeger (T-As2), who was serving as an NCO in the Wehrmacht and was stationed on Usedom. Trager provided the AK with more detailed information regarding the \\"flying torpedoes\\" and pinpointed Peenem√ºnde on Usedom as the site of the tests. The information obtained led to the first report from the AK to the British which was purportedly written by Jerzy Chmielewski, \\"Rafal\\", who was in charge of processing economic reports the \\"Lombard\\" group obtained. Operation Most III Intelligence reports on the V-1 and V-2 After V-2 flight testing began near the village of Blizna, south of Mielec (the first launch from there was on November 5, 1943), the AK had a unique opportunity to gather more information and to intercept parts of test rockets (most of which did not explode). The AK quickly located the new testing ground at Blizna thanks to reports from local farmers and AK field units, who managed to obtain on their own pieces of the fired rockets, by arriving on the scene before German patrols. In late 1943 in cooperation with British intelligence, a plan was formed to make an attempt to capture a whole unexploded V-2 rocket and transport it to Britain. At the time, opinion within British intelligence was divided. One group tended to believe the AK accounts and reports, while another was highly sceptical and argued that it was impossible to launch a rocket of the size reported by the AK using any known fuel. Then in early March 1944, British Intelligence Headquarters received a report of a Polish Underground worker (code name \\"Makary\\") who had crawled up to the Blizna railway line and saw on a flatcar heavily guarded by SS troops \\"an object which, though covered by a tarpaulin, bore every resemblance to a monstrous torpedo.\\" The Polish intelligence also informed the British about usage of liquid oxygen in a radio report from June 12, 1944. Some experts within both British and Polish intelligence communities quickly realized that learning the nature of the fuel utilized by the rockets was crucial, and hence, the need to obtain a working example. From April 1944, numerous test rockets were falling near Sarnaki village, in the vicinity of the Bug River, south of Siemiatycze. The number of parts collected by the Polish intelligence increased. They were then analyzed by the Polish scientists in Warsaw. According to some reports, around May 20, 1944, a relatively undamaged V-2 rocket fell on the swampy bank of the Bug near Sarnaki and local Poles managed to hide it before German arrival. Subsequently, the rocket was dismantled and smuggled across Poland. FOOTNOTE: there are no material evidence, nor first-hand reports on capturing a whole rocket in May 1944, only several second-hand ones. An Intelligence report from June 12 mentions only parts of a rocket. Operation Most III (Bridge III) secretly transported parts of the rocket out of Poland for analysis by British intelligence. Impact on the course of the war While the early knowledge on a rocket by AK was quite a feat in pure intelligence terms, it did not necessarily translate into significant results on the ground. On the other hand, the AK did alert the British as to the dangers posed by both missile designs, which led them to allocate more resources to bombing production and launching sites and thus lessened the eventual devastation caused by them. Also, the Operation Hydra bombing raid on Peenem√ºnde, purportedly carried out on the basis of Home Army intelligence, did delay the V-2 by six to eight weeks.

The label is also known for distributing music by smaller labels like Sonny Lester's Groove Merchant, Gene Redd's De- Lite Records, Chart Records and the Swedish label Sonet Records (for which it distributed late-1960s recordings by Bill Haley & His Comets in Canada and the US). They also issued records from Britain's Hallmark Records label. History Pickwick Records (originally formed as Pickwick Sales Corporation, later Pickwick International) was founded in 1950 by Cy Leslie, whose first business was a prerecorded greeting-card service that in 1946 turned into Voco Records, a label of children's records. In 1957, after successfully marketing its Cricket children's label of 78- and 45rpm records, Pickwick entered the LP market with low-priced records, beginning with its Design label.Hoffmann, Frank Editor & Ferstler, Howard Technical Editor Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound Routledge (2005) The albums from the 1960s into the early 1970s bore the \\"Pickwick/33\\" imprint. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed once worked as a staff songwriter for Pickwick Records, and gained experience in its small recording studio. Several of Pickwick's soundalike albums from 1964 to 1965 feature Reed as an uncredited session musician. Two of his songs, \\"Cycle Annie\\" (credited to The Beachnuts) and \\"You're Driving Me Insane\\" (as The Roughnecks), both appeared on the Soundsville! compilation in 1965. \\"The Ostrich\\" and \\"Sneaky Pete\\", two earlier songs by Reed, united him with John Cale, leading to their founding of the Velvet Underground. Amos Heilicher and his brother Daniel Heilicher merged their Musicland retail chain with Pickwick International in the late 1960s. Capitol Records had an early interest in Pickwick, and many Capitol artists including Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys and Nat King Cole, had recordings issued on Pickwick; however, Capitol sold its share in the company in 1970. In the 1970s, the label changed direction, and began reissuing LPs that had been deleted from catalogues of the major record labels, especially the RCA Records budget reissue label RCA Camden. Most notable in the RCA Camden catalogue, Pickwick obtained the rights in the mid-1970s to reissue Camden albums featuring recordings by Elvis Presley. The company also put out an edited reissue of Presley's soundtrack album of Frankie and Johnny, and a two-LP set of mostly movie songs titled Double Dynamite. After Presley died in August 1977, sales of his recordings increased dramatically and RCA reclaimed the rights to Presley's Camden releases from Pickwick. Pickwick also reissued numerous LPs from the Motown catalogue during the 1970s. On many of these albums, the cover art was changed, and/or the track listing was altered (with two or more songs deleted). In the early 1980s Motown began re-releasing its own catalogue albums, thus ending Pickwick's series. The company also started the subsidiary label P.I.P and started distributing Gene Redd's De-Lite Records, to issue original material. De-Lite hit it big in 1974 and 1975 with million-selling singles & albums by funk band Kool & The Gang. P.I.P had a couple of big dance club hits with \\"7-6-5-4-3-2-1 (Blow Your Whistle)\\" and \\"Drive My Car\\" by Gary Toms Empire in 1975. In 1977, Pickwick was sold to the American Can Company, which relocated its corporate headquarters from Long Island City, New York to Minneapolis, Minnesota, then subsequently sold its assets to PolyGram in the same year. PolyGram maintained the De-Lite Records label for releases by Kool & the Gang who experienced a second wave of success after the addition of new lead singer, J.T. Taylor, beginning with the group's 1979 album, Ladies Night. PolyGram later did away with the De-lite imprint, and subsequent Kool & The Gang records were issued by PolyGram's Mercury label, while De-Lite Records was acquired by Unidisc. After the purchase by PolyGram, Pickwick started putting out new material again, but this time it was \\"Sound-Alike\\" albums which featured covers of a certain artist or group on one album, and Disco Christmas albums. Most of those albums were performed by session musicians and singers dubbed Mirror Image; Pickwick also issued a few records from groups such as The Young Lovers and Kings Road in earlier years. This lasted until 1983 when PolyGram folded Pickwick. The Hallmark name has since been revived as a budget record label owned by the Pickwick Group. Current ownership Pickwick's catalogue (including the entire De- lite/Mercury catalogue of Kool & The Gang) is now owned by Universal Music which was formed by the merger of the MCA and PolyGram families of labels in 1998. Promotional material From the liner notes featured on virtually all 1965‚Äì69 Design releases: Criticism In the early 1980s, Pickwick manufactured so-called \\"audiophile\\" pressings on heavy vinyl (usually 180‚Äì240 grams). However, some audio aficionados found the sound quality in these pressings inferior to that of normal vinyl. These LPs were quickly deleted and some record collectors are now willing to pay extremely high prices for these records. In 2003, a copy of The Beach Boys Greatest Hits sold for just over $2,500 at auction, and in 2008 a sealed copy of James Bond‚ÄîThe Themes (which was a purely soundalike record) sold for $4,000. Pickwick was well known for its \\"soundalike\\" records which often implied to be the original artists, but actually featured in-house bands or singers. When Pickwick issued The Everly's in 1984, all the songs were in fact covered by a singing duo called \\"Twice Divided\\".LA Garage Scene 69‚Äì89, Galaxy Books 1994 References in popular culture Pickwick was the record label to which the fictional band Cr√®me Brul√©e, from British sitcom The League of Gentlemen, was nearly signed to during its 1970s heyday. This came from a running gag about the market-stall sales which Pickwick enjoyed in England. Thes One, from the hip-hop group People Under The Stairs, mentions the label in the track \\"43 Labels I Like\\" (from its 2000 album Question in the Form of an Answer).

At that time there were 34 aircraft based at this airport: 12% single-engine, 12% multi-engine and 76% helicopter. Airlines and destinations Historical airline service Grand Canyon National Park Airport had scheduled passenger jet service operated by several airlines at different times in the past including Air West, Hughes Airwest, Republic Airlines (1979-1986) and TriStar Airlines. Hughes Airwest operated Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners to Las Vegas (LAS) and Phoenix (PHX) with continuing one stop, direct service to Los Angeles (LAX) and Burbank (BUR) while TriStar flew British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jets to Las Vegas (LAS) with direct one stop service to LAX. At one point, Hughes Airwest also operated Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft to Las Vegas and Phoenix with continuing, no change of plane service to Salt Lake City (SLC). Hughes Airwest was then merged into Republic Airlines which continued to operate DC-9 jet flights into the airport. During the summer of 1982, Republic was operating two daily DC-9 flights nonstop to Las Vegas (LAS) as well as daily nonstop DC-9 service to Phoenix (PHX) and direct one stop service daily to Burbank (BUR).http://www.departedflights.com, Aug. 1, 1982 Republic Airlines system timetable By the mid-1980s, Republic had ceased all service into the airport.http://www.departedflights.com, April 28, 1985 Republic Airlines system timetable Air West, the predecessor airline of Hughes Airwest, also operated Douglas DC-9 jets from the airport in addition to flying services with Fairchild F-27 turboprops.

The park consists of situated around Byrd Lake, a man-made lake created by the impoundment of Byrd Creek in the 1930s. The park is set amidst an environmental microcosm of the Cumberland Plateau and provides numerous recreational activities, including an 18-hole Bear Trace golf course. Cumberland Mountain State Park began as part of the greater Cumberland Homesteads Project, a New Deal-era initiative by the Resettlement Administration that helped relocate poverty-stricken families on the Cumberland Plateau to small farms centered on what is now the Cumberland Homestead community. The families of Homestead built the park with help from the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. The park was deeded to the state of Tennessee in 1938. Alvin C. York served as the park's superintendent until 1940, when he resigned to advise on the filming of Sergeant York. Geographical setting Byrd Creek, downstream from the dam Cumberland Mountain State Park is situated atop the Cumberland Plateau approximately halfway between the plateau's Walden Ridge escarpment to the east and the plateau's western escarpment to the west. The southern fringe of the Crab Orchard Mountains rise just over to the east, and the northern tip of the Sequatchie Valley is located roughly to the south. The city of Crossville is located immediately north of the park. Byrd Creek, the park's major drainage, flows eastward from the hills to the west for approximately before veering north at its confluence with Coon Hollow Branch. The Byrd Creek Dam, which is located immediately north of this confluence, retains a reservoir that covers approximately . Beyond the dam, Byrd Creek absorbs Threemile Creek, which flows from the west, and continues eastward for another before emptying into Daddys Creek (a tributary of the Obed River) near Crab Orchard. Cumberland Mountain State Park forms a semicircle around Byrd Creek and Threemile Creek, with Byrd Lake being the eastern or \\"closed\\" half of the circle. The park's main entrance is located along Tennessee State Route 419 (Pigeon Ridge Road) just west of Homestead. U.S. Route 127, which intersects SR 419 at Homestead, connects the area with Crossville and Interstate 40 to the north and the Sequatchie Valley to the south. Tennessee State Route 68, which also intersects US 127 at Homestead, connects the area to Spring City in the Tennessee Valley to the east. History Mill House Lodge, built by the CCC in the 1930s In 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, the U.S. government established the Subsistence Homesteads Project to aide poverty- stricken families by relocating them to small farms. The government essentially provided low-interest loans that helped families acquire and clear land, build houses and outbuildings, and plant crops. Shortly after the project was established, several businessmen and political leaders from across Tennessee convened and drafted a proposal to have a homesteads project established in the Cumberland Plateau region, which had been particularly hard hit by the Depression when dozens of coal mines in the region were forced to close. The Division of Subsistence Homesteads accepted the proposal in January 1934, and established Cumberland Homesteads, Inc. to oversee the project. The new firm chose a tract south of Crossville for the location of the project's farms and communal structures. The Civil Works Administration hired several hundred Crossvillians to clear and prepare the land for the homesteads, helping to ease the Depression in Cumberland County. In 1935, 250 families were selected for the project from over 1,500 applicants.James Moore, An Analysis of the New Deal Subsistence Homesteads Program in Cumberland County, Tennessee (Cookeville, Tenn.: Tennessee Technological University, 1967), 3-6. Part of the Cumberland Homesteads Project called for the construction of a recreational area near the center of the homesteads. Two New Deal agencies, the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps, arrived in the area in 1934 to build the recreational area's facilities.Helen Bullard Krechniak, Cumberland County, Tennessee, 1956‚Äì1986 (Crossville, Tenn.: H.B. Krechniak, 1987), 57. Company 3464 of the CCC, under the direction of the National Park Service, began the construction of Byrd Creek Dam in 1935 and completed it in 1938, effectively creating the Byrd Lake. The dam, like many of the Homestead structures, is constructed of a native sandstone commonly called Crab Orchard Stone. At a height of and length of , the dam is the largest masonry project ever completed by the CCC. CCC Company 3464, assisted by Company 1471, continued to work at the park until 1941, building trails, picnic areas, cabins, a boathouse, a bathhouse, and other structures.South Cumberland Elementary School Library, \\"Cumberland Mountain State Park Bridge.\\" 24 January 2000.

The Mill House Lodge, located near the dam, was originally built to house a gristmill that would serve the Cumberland Homesteaders. A group of local Quakers were brought in to construct the mill, although opposition from local mills-- who considered a federally subsidized mill unfair competition-- forced Cumberland Homesteads to nix the project. The mill house had been completed, but the waterwheel and grinding mechanisms were never installed. The State of Tennessee acquired the park in 1938, and the park officially opened in 1940. Numerous new facilities were constructed at the park between 1948 and 1962, and a new visitor center and swimming pool were built in the 1980s. An 18-hole \\"Bear Trace\\" golf course-- one of five Bear Traces designed for the State of Tennessee by golfer Jack Nicklaus-- opened at Cumberland Mountain State Park in 1998.\\"Tennessee Golf Trail -- Bear Trace Cumberland Mountain.\\" Retrieved: 25 September 2008. In 1988, many of the park's original buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Cumberland Homesteads Historic District.Elizabeth Straw, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Cumberland Homesteads Historic District, May 1988. The park today Backcountry campsite along the Cumberland Overnight Trail Cumberland Mountain State Park currently maintains 37 rustic cabins, each of which can accommodate 4 to 10 people, depending on size. The Mill House Lodge can accommodate 16 people. There are a total of 147 campsites at the park's campgrounds, and one backcountry campsite located along the Cumberland Overnight Trail. Recreational facilities include an olympic-sized swimming pool, picnic pavilions, playgrounds, four tennis courts, horseshoe pits, and shuffleboard, basketball, badminton, and volleyball courts. The Bear Trace golf course is a , par 72 course open year- round. Byrd Lake provides fishing and paddleboating opportunities. Several miles of hiking trails meander through the park, mostly following Byrd Creek and adjacent hills. The Pioneer Trail loops through the hemlock forest along the shores of Byrd Lake and Byrd Lake's headwaters. The Cumberland Plateau Trail is a self-guided interpretive trail that loops through a diverse forest stand downstream from the dam. The Byrd Creek Trail is a extension of the Cumberland Plateau Trail that loops around the banks of Byrd Creek. The Cumberland Overnight Trail is a extension of the Byrd Creek Trail that winds through the hills flanking Threemile Creek.Russ Manning, The Historic Cumberland Plateau: An Explorer's Guidge (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), 202-203. The backcountry campsite is located in a cedar flat near the overnight trail's halfway point. Cumberland Homesteads Tower Museum The Cumberland Homesteads Tower Museum, located from the park, recalls the development of the Cumberland Homestead Community of the 1930s. The octagonal Cumberlands Tower was originally constructed by the CCC between 1937 and 1938 using Crab Orchard Stone to house the Cumberland Homesteads offices. The tower features a water tank and a 97-step stairway to the lookout platform at the top with views of the park. The base features a museum with exhibits about the history of the Homesteads project and its residents, and period displays. Visitors can also tour an original Homesteads house which has been furnished to appear as during the Depression.Cumberland Homesteads , Tennessee History for Kids. Retrieved: 13 February 2013.

The Thomas Christians were in communion with the Church of the East (East Syriac Rite liturgy) of Persia. However, the Portuguese did not accept the legitimacy of local Malabar traditions, and they began to impose Latin usages upon the Thomas Christians. At the Synod of Diamper held in 1599 under the presidency of the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa, Aleixo de Menezes, a number of such latinizations were adopted, including the appointment of Portuguese bishops, changes in the Eucharistic liturgy, the use of Roman vestments, the requirement of clerical celibacy, and the setting up of the Inquisition. After over 50 years of rule under the Latin Church, the majority of the Malabar Christians protested against Padroado Jesuits through the Coonan Cross Oath (1653) at Mattancherry to liberate themselves from the efforts for latinization by the Portuguese Padroado missionaries. In response to the Coonan Cross Oath revolt, Pope Alexander VII sent Carmelite friars to the Malabar coast to deal with the Thomas Christians. With the help of the Carmelites, by 1662, the majority of the dissidents had returned to communion with the Catholic Church under the leadership of Palliveettil Chandy. Pope Alexander VII established a new East Syriac Rite hierarchy in communion with Rome for the Saint Thomas Christians; this faction came to be known as the Pazhayakuttukar, or \\"Old Party\\", which would become the modern-day Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (the Chaldean Syrian Church became the faction that split off from the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church in the late 19th century). The faction that resisted Rome came to be known as the Puthenkuttukar, or \\"New Party\\", which under the leadership of Thoma I sought the help of other Eastern churches, resulting in a relationship with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. The \\"New Party\\" faction became the Malankara Church and adopted a variant of the West Syriac Rite known as the Malankara Rite from the Syriac Orthodox Church.Gregorios & Roberson, p. 285.Vadakkekara, p. 91. Background The Saint Thomas Christians remain in communion with the Church of the East.I. Gillman and H.-J. Klimkeit, Christians in Asia Before 1500, (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1999), p. 177. It is believed that Malabar Church was in communion with the Church of the East from CE 300 to CE 1599. With the establishment of Portuguese power in parts of India, clergy of that empire, in particular members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), attempted to Latinise the Indian Christians. The Portuguese started a Latin Church diocese in Goa (1534) and another at Cochin (1558), and sought to bring the St.Thomas Christians under the jurisdiction of the Portuguese padroado and into the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. A series of synods, including the 1585 Synod of Goa, were held, which introduced Latinized elements to the local liturgy. In 1599 Aleixo de Menezes, Archbishop of Goa, led the Synod of Diamper, which finally brought the Saint Thomas Christians fully under the authority of the Latin Archdiocese of Goa. The independence of the ancient Church of Malankara was rescinded. The Padroado (Patronage) of the Portuguese Crown was only momentary for the feelings of resentment and the desire to regain independence among the St. Thomas Christians were very real and could not be contained for long. In 1653, Ahatallah of Antioch visited Malankara and was captured by the Portuguese. He was taken on board a Portuguese ship at Madras bound for Goa and en route, it touched Cochin. Local Christians heard of the arrival of the ship at Cochin. The Archdeacon with a large number of Priests and several thousands of Saint Thomas Christians assembled at Mattancherry Cochin; their efforts to visit the Bishop when the fleet arrived in Cochin intensified but ultimately, they were not fruitful. Several letters were sent to all the civil and religious authorities in Cochin, for at least an opportunity to visit Ahatallah, to examine his credentials and to verify his identity, promising that if he was found an imposter, they would be the first to press for his punishment. Due to the staunch and intransigent opposition of the Archbishop Garcia and the Jesuit fathers it did not happen. The Archbishop even refused to meet the Christians, who wanted to discuss the matter with him. What happened to Ahatallah in the midst of Arabian Sea is still a mystery. Further resentment of these measures led a part of the community to take the Coonan Cross Oath in 1653 swearing \\"never to submit to the Portuguese\\". Ahatallah claimed to be the Patriarch of Antioch and hence was often called or called himself \\"Ignatius Aloho\\" which was the name of the Patriarch Ignatius Hidayat Aloho. According to some writing on 1980s, Metropolitan Ahatalla is said to have landed at Surat in 1652 and thence came to Mylapore, where he was arrested by the Jesuits on 3 August 1652. While at Mylapore, Ahatalla met two Syrian Christian deacons, viz: Chengannur ltty and Kuravilangad Kizhakkedath Kurien from Malankara, who were on a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Thomas and sent a letter through them to the Church of Malankara saying: > Behold, I Ignatius, Patriarch of All India and China, send to you a letter > through the clerics who came here from your place. When you have read this > letter diligently send me two priests and forty men. If however, you wish to > send them from your place, send them cautiously, quickly and soon, so that > seeing your people they would release me without hindrance. I came to the > city of Mylapore thinking that many people come here, and that priests would > get me to your place of the Indias. In the year 1652 of our Lord, in the > month of August, on Monday, I arrived in Mylapore in the monastery of the > Jesuits. In the same monastery I stay, and they help me very much; may their > reward increase here and there. Peace be with them, with you, and with us > now and always. Amen. I, Ignatius, Patriarch of All India and China. When the ship carrying Ahatallah reached Goa, he was handed over to the inquisition, and he was kept in close custody in the Jesuit house there. He was sent to Portugal on the ship \\"Nosa Senhora da Graca\\" from Goa and reached Lisbon on 14 July 1653. The king of Portugal decided to send him to Rome. Accordingly, while he was on his way to Rome, he died at Paris on 26 March 1654 and is buried at the Jerusalem Chapel of the Cordeliena Church.Death register Cordeliena Church Paris St. Vincent De Paul who met Ahatallah at Paris mentions of him in the following words \\"There remains in this city a good old man of eighty years, a foreigner, who was lodging with the late monsignor Archbishop of Myra. They say he is the Patriarch of Antioch. Be that it may, he is alone and has no mark of prelacy\\". The treatment of Ahatalla, however, shocked the Christian community, and their wounded feelings effervesced into a mass upsurge which heralded the breaking off from the Padroado of the Portuguese Crown and the \\"Paulists\\". Oath Seeing that the Archbishop thus turned a deaf ear to their insistent pleas, the Nasranis became extremely exasperated. A rumor also was spread at this time that Ahatallah was drowned by the Portuguese. Hence on 3 January 1653, Archdeacon Thomas and representatives from the community assembled at St Mary's Church (Nossa Senhora da Vida) at Mattancherry to swear what would be known as the \\"Coonan Cross Oath\\". The following oath was read aloud with lighted candles, with the Archdeacon and the leading priests touching the Bible while the people held ropes tied to a cross outside the church:The Troubled Days of Francis Garcia S. J. Archbp. of Cranganore by Joseph Theekkedathu S. D. B. Page 60 The number of people who took part in the Sathyam (Oath) was so significant that all of them could not touch the granite Cross at the same time. Therefore, they held on to ropes tied to the Cross in all directions. According to tradition, After the historic oath was read, out of a population of 200,000 St. Thomas Christians, only 400 remained loyal to the Archbishop Garcia. They met at Edapally St George Church on 5 February 1653, on the last day of the Moonnu Noyambu (Three day fast) feast of Jona, the most solemn day of the feast, and declared that through a letter, Patriarch Ahatalla has conferred upon Archdeacon Thomas the Governorship of the Malankara Syrian Church and all the powers of Jurisdiction over the Church. Councillors were assigned to the Governor. They were Chandy Palliveettil of Kuravilangad, George Vengoor of Akaparambu, Chandy Kadavil of Kaduthuruthy. Then, according to the second letter of Ahatallah produced by Ittithomman Anjilimoottil Kathanar on 22 May 1653, at St Mary's Church Alangad, during the solemn celebration of the Feast of the Ascension, the people and priests assembled there elected Archdeacon Thomas, as their Bishop and gave him the title Thoma I. He was consecrated using an oriental consecration rite, but by the laying hands on him by 12 priests, instead of any bishops doing it, which was mandatory according to the Canon laws of all the Churches all over the world. Until then there was no such a tradition of consecration by priests instead of bishops in Malankara. Hence the Malankara Syrian Church adopted quite a new way of ordaining a bishop by laying hands of 12 priests (Kaiveppu) as there was no bishop in India at that time who would do it for him. All the bishops who were in India at that time were of the Latin Catholic Church and they would not do the consecration of him as it was against their bishop the said oath was made. There were no oriental or eastern church bishops in India at that time, because the Portuguese had imposed a sort of embargo on the Malankara Syrian Church, so that no such bishops would reach India. The Pope's apostolic commissary and Carmelite Fr Friar Joseph of St Mary Sebastiani arrived in Malankara in 1657 and started challenging the legitimacy of the ordination of Thoma I. This led to the split of Malankara Syrian Church in two factions, one supporting Thoma I and the other supporting Friar Sebastiani. This led the Thoma I faction of the Malankara Syrian Church to ask for a Metropolitan Bishop from the Church of Antioch to regularize the validity of the consecration of Thoma I. in addition to its religious significance, the event broke the 54-year-old Padroado (patronage) rule of the Portuguese Crown over the Malankara Syrian Church. (Padroado supremacy of Portuguese Crown imposed at the Udayamperur Synod in 1599) Aftermath The Catholic faction was headed by the Carmelite Fr Friar Sebastiani until 1663, when Dutch came and captured Cochin and they forced all the Europeans other than the Dutch to leave the place. Thus when he was forced to leave India he consecrated Chandy Palliveettil a cousin of Thoma I as Bishop of the Syrian Catholic faction. After the Coonan Cross Oath the Portuguese missionaries attempted reconciliation with the St. Thomas Christians but they were not successful. It was as a result of this, that Pope Alexander VII sent the Italian Fr Friar Joseph of St Maria Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in winning over a large section of St. Thomas Christians, including three of the four councillors of Thoma I: Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar, Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar to his side. This led to the first permanent split in the Malankara Syrian Church. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Palliveettil Chandy was designated as the Pazhayakuttukar, or \\"Old Party\\", while the branch affiliated with Thoma I was called as the Puthenkuttukar, or \\"New Party\\".Vadakkekara, p. 84; 86.Frykenberg, p. 361.Fernando, p. 79.Chaput, pp. 7‚Äì8. Both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the St. Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note. In 1665, Gregorios Abdul Jaleel, a bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox (West Syrian) Patriarch of Antioch after the Metropolitan Ahatalla arrived in India at the invitation of Thoma I. This visit resulted in establishing full ecclesiastical communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch and a permanent schism in St. Thomas' Nasrani Community . Between 1657-63, 84 of the 116 Malankara Syrian churches shifted their allegiance to the Malankara Syrian Catholic faction of the East Syriac rite. This Church from 1923 is known officially as the Syro- Malabar Catholic Church. It is in full communion with the Latin Catholic Church. They received their own Syro-Malabar Hierarchy on 21 December 1923, with the Metropolitan Augustine Kandathil as the head of their Church. The St. Thomas Christians by this process became divided into Catholic and Malankara Syrians. The split into Malankara and Syro-Malabar factions would become permanent. Over the next centuries, the Malankara faction would experience further splits and schisms, and a small portion of the Syrian Catholic Church reaffirmed their ties with the Assyrian Church of the East in 1882, forming the Chaldean Syrian Church of Trissur. Various interpretations of the events * Stephen Neill's version The situation is explained by Stephen Neill (an Anglican Protestant missionary, from Scotland) in his book A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707. : \\" January 1653, priests and people assembled in the church of Our Lady at Mattancherry, and standing in front of a cross and lighted candles swore upon the holy Gospel that they would no longer obey Garcia, and that they would have nothing further to do with the Jesuits they would recognize the Archdeacon as the governor of their Church. This is the famous oath of the \\"Coonan Cross\\" (the open-air Cross which stands outside the church at Mattancherry). The Saint Thomas Christians did not at any point suggest that they wished to separate themselves from the Pope. They could no longer tolerate the arrogance of Garcia. And their detestation of the Jesuits, to whose overbearing attitude and lack of sympathy they attributed all their troubles, breathes through all the documents of the time. But let the Pope send them a true bishop not a Jesuit, and they will be pleased to receive and obey him.\\"Coonan Cross Oath, chroniclesofmalabar.blogspot.com, June 2011; accessed 31 December 2015.Stephen Neill, A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707, pp. 326-27 It is to be noted that as said in Stephen Neill's version, the then leader Thoma Archdeacon (whom they oathed as the governor of the Church as mentioned above) and his successors and followers were not supporting Pope or Roman Catholic Church after the event but sought the support of other Eastern Churches including Antioch. * Malankara Syrian Church : In response to the continuous appeal of the Thoma Arkadiyakon (Archdeacon), who was then given the Church leadership, Ahatallah arrived in 1653. A rumour spread that the Portuguese arrested him, tied him up and cast him into the ocean. As a result, a large gathering of about 25,000 assembled at Mattancherry and took the Oath at \\"Koonan Cross\\", the historical \\"Koonan Kurisu Sathayam\\", in 1653, declaring their future generations would never adhere to the Franks (i.e. Portuguese) nor accept the faith of the Pope. Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church, Malabar Independent Syrian Church and Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, adhere to the version of Malankara Syrian Church.

It was designed in 1894 by Fridtjof Nansen and further developed by Shale Niskin in 1966.  Description  Sailor holding a Nansen bottle The bottle, more precisely a metal or plastic cylinder, is lowered on a cable into the ocean, and when it has reached the required depth, a brass weight called a \\"messenger\\" is dropped down the cable. When the weight reaches the bottle, the impact tips the bottle upside down and trips a spring-loaded valve at the end, trapping the water sample inside. The bottle and sample are then retrieved by hauling in the cable. A second messenger can be arranged to be released by the inverting mechanism, and slide down the cable until it reaches another Nansen bottle. By fixing a sequence of bottles and messengers at intervals along the cable, a series of samples at increasing depth can be taken from a single action. The sea temperature at the water sampling depth is recorded by means of a reversing thermometer fixed to the Nansen bottle. This is a mercury thermometer with a constriction in its capillary tube which, when the thermometer is inverted, causes the thread to break and trap the mercury, fixing the temperature reading. Since water pressure at depth will compress the thermometer walls and affect the indicated temperature, the thermometer is protected by a rigid enclosure. A non-protected thermometer is paired with the protected one, and comparison of the two temperature readings allows both temperature and pressure at the sampling point to be determined.  Niskin bottle  Niskin bottle about to be deployed The Niskin bottle is an improvement on the Nansen bottle patented by Shale Niskin in March 1966. Instead of a metal bottle sealed at one end, the 'bottle' is a tube, usually plastic to minimize contamination of the sample, and open to the water at both ends. Each end is equipped with a cap which is either spring-loaded or tensioned by an elastic rope. The action of the messenger weight is to trip both caps shut and seal the tube. A reversing thermometer may also be carried on a frame fixed to the Niskin bottle. Since there is no rotation of the bottle to fix the temperature measurement, the thermometer has a separate spring-loaded rotating mechanism of its own tripped by the messenger weight. A modern variation of the Niskin bottle uses actuated valves that may be either preset to trip at a specific depth detected by a pressure switch, or remotely controlled to do so via an electrical signal sent from the surface. This arrangement conveniently allows for a large number of Niskin bottles to be mounted together in a circular frame termed a rosette. As many as 36 bottles may be mounted on a single rosette. Thermistor temperature sensors are more commonly employed on Niskin bottle rosettes due to their higher accuracy compared to mercury thermometers.

From its source in the Ethiopian Highlands it flows west for to join the Pibor River. The Baro-Pibor confluence marks the beginning of the Sobat River, a tributary of the White Nile.; online at Google Books The Baro and its tributaries drain a watershed in size. The river's mean annual discharge at its mouth is 241 m¬≥/s (8,510 ft¬≥/s).; online at Google Books  Course  The Baro/Openo river is created by the confluence of the Birbir and Gebba Rivers, east of Metu in the Illubabor Zone of the Oromia Region. It then flows west through the Gambela Region to join with the Pibor River, both of them creating the Sobat. Other notable tributaries of the Baro/Openo include the Alwero and Jikawo Rivers. The Baro meets the Pibor river to the west of Jikawo. During the rainy season the river floods to form the huge inundated area to the east and south of Jikawo, previously penetrating as far as Abobo and Gog to the east and south-east.  Natural history  Of the Sobat River's tributaries, the Baro/Openo River is by far the largest, contributing 83% of the total water flowing into the Sobat. During the rainy season, between June and October, the Baro River alone contributes about 10% of the Nile's water at Aswan, Egypt. In contrast, these rivers have very low flow during the dry season.; online at Internet Archive  History  The boundary between Sudan and Ethiopia was defined for the region near the Baro/Openo River in 1899 by Major H.H. Austin and Major Charles W. Gwynn of the British Royal Engineers.Described by Austin in his article, \\"Survey of the Sobat Region\\", Geographical Journal, 17 (May, 1901), pp. 495-512. They had no knowledge of the land, its inhabitants, or their languages, and were short on supplies. Rather than defining a line based on ethnic groups and traditional territories, essentially along the escarpment that separates the highlands and the plains, they simply proposed drawing the line down the middle of the Akobo River and parts of the Pibor and Baro rivers. This boundary was consummated in the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1902, resulting in an area in Ethiopian Gambela Region called the Baro/Openo Salient. This area is more closely connected to South Sudan than Ethiopia, both in terms of natural features and people. The Baro Salient was used as a sanctuary by Sudanese insurgents during the country's long civil wars. It was difficult for Sudan to exert authority over a region that is part of Ethiopia, and Ethiopia was reluctant to police this remote region and become involved in the politics of Sudan's internal conflicts.; online at Internet Archive Vittorio Bottego, who explored the area in the later 1890s, proposed naming the river after Admiral Simone Antonio Saint-Bon.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 21 December 2007) The only navigable river in Ethiopia, the Baro's most important city is Gambela, which served as a port from 1907 until the 1990s when civil war in Ethiopia and Sudan forced shipping on the river to be halted. The Italian L. Usoni unsuccessfully prospected for gold in the Baro river valley, and published his findings in 1952.

A Special Needs Trust is a specific type of irrevocable trust that exists under Common Law. Several Common Law nations have established specific statutes relative to the creation and use of Special Needs Trusts, and where they exist a Special Needs Trust will not be valid unless it comports with the requirements listed in the statute. The applicable Federal statute in the United States is found at Title 42 United States Code Section 1396p(d)(4)(A). Several States have established their own statutes. Generally, irrevocable trusts can be used for minors, beneficiaries with disabilities (either physically or mentally challenged), and as a method of asset protection. In addition to the public benefits preservation reasons for such a trust, there are administrative advantages of using a trust to hold and manage property intended for the benefit of the beneficiary, especially if the beneficiary lacks the legal capacity to handle his or her own financial affairs. However, Special Needs Trusts can also be used as asset reservoirs, allowing otherwise neurotypical individuals to qualify for governmental benefits.  Throughout the world  A trust for a beneficiary with disability may be set up in any of the common law countries, including the United States, and also in other countries that recognize the concept of a \\"trust.\\" In such jurisdictions, there is often legislation that provides advantages to such trusts in the areas of taxation and state benefits, e.g., in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States of America, such trusts provide advantages in helping beneficiaries qualify for health care coverage under state Medicaid programs, and also for monthly cash payments under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program operated by the Social Security Administration.  Overview  Special needs trusts can provide benefits to, and protect the assets of, minors and the physically challenged or the mentally challenged. Special needs trusts are frequently used to receive an inheritance or personal injury settlement proceeds on behalf of a minor or a person with disability, or are founded from the proceeds of compensation for criminal injuries, litigation or insurance settlements. A common feature of trusts in all common law jurisdictions is that they may be run either by family members (a private trust) or by trustees appointed by the court. Especially where a trust is to be established for a child or young person with disability, great care is generally taken in the choice of appropriate trustees to manage the trust assets and to deal with future replacement appointments. The use of a private discretionary trust can not only be more efficient in terms of taxation and access to government benefits but can also allow for more efficient investment of funds held than where funds are held by a court official (such as the Official Receiver in England and Wales). However where no appropriate trustees can be found, e.g. on the death of existing trustees, the court will intervene. Special needs trusts are often set up under the guidance of a structured settlement planner in cooperation with a qualified legal and financial team to ensure the trust is set up correctly. Only authorized non-profit organizations are approved to manage a special needs trust program. Such pooled trusts are available throughout the United States and are often centered on certain purposes (often disabilities).

The show aired from 1989 to 1998. Synopsis The program consisted primarily of low-budget films, bookended by in-studio or on-location comedy skits featuring the show's hosts. In addition to skits, the hosts would also provide sardonic comments about the featured film(s), and observations on various Hollywood- and/or New York City-area clubs and attractions (when the series was shooting out of studio). Including commercials, the program typically ran from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. The movies aired ranged from cult classics, to B movies, to other fare not appearing on television frequently. Up All Night would regularly show sexploitation films, with the explicit content edited out. =Hosts= The series began on January 7, 1989 with comic Gilbert Gottfried hosting on Saturdays from New York City. In that first show, Gottfried was seen in an empty office building in Manhattan. The first two films that night were Cheerleaders Beach Party and Stuck on You!. Halfway through the first season, a Friday night show broadcast from Los Angeles hosted by actress/comedian Caroline Schlitt (fresh off of the short-lived Camp Midnite) was added. When Schlitt left the program in December 1990, comedian/B-movie actress Rhonda Shear replaced her on Fridays, beginning on January 4, 1991. In 1995, the Shear edition moved to New York City (home of the Gottfried edition), and stayed there for the remainder of the run.We Miss USA Network's Up All Night with Rhonda Shear! Rhonda talks with TV STORE ONLINE about the show tvstoreonline.com. July 25, 2013. =Format= Originally, the show aired at 11 p.m. on Saturdays, and featured two movies (with in-studio or on-location comedy skits in between), which were then followed by a repeat of the first movie. When the Friday night edition was added in mid-1989, the format now consisted of three different movies, with the third one being unhosted (the bumpers for the third movie were simply narrated by the host, depending on the edition). Some episodes did not have a \\"third\\" movie. The Friday show originally began at midnight and ran until 6 a.m.; in July 1991, it was changed to the same time as the Saturday edition. In December 1994, the format was changed slightly to incorporate Duckman into the 11:00 p.m. timeslot, prior to the first movie. This trend of incorporating Duckman into the show continued on occasion until Duckman ended in September 1997. In April 1996, the Saturday edition was moved to 12 a.m.; July 1996 had it move back to 11 p.m., and August 1996 had the Friday show move to 12 a.m. In January 1997, the Saturday show moved to 12 a.m., with the Friday show moving back to 11 p.m. a month later in February. For a short time in 1997, there was no third movie. =Specials= Occasionally, the show did special episodes which were often hosted by Shear and Gottfried together. They included Grad Night specials at Universal Studios Florida during 1992 and 1993, a mock B-Movie Awards special during 1993, and New Year's Eve specials during 1991, 1992, and 1993. Cancellation In 1998, USA came under the new management of Barry Diller, and decided to go for a more general and upscale viewership. This meant many of USA's long-running series were either overhauled or canceled ‚Äì Up All Night ended up among the latter. The network relieved Shear and Gottfried of their hosting duties (while still showing the Up All Night imagery before/after commercial breaks), and began airing re-runs of mainstream films that appealed to a broader audience. By 2002, the Up All Night name, music, and graphics were completely removed from the films. From December 1988 to February 1998, a grand total of over 900 episodes of USA Up All Night were shot. International version In 1993, for about a year, Rhonda Shear hosted a Spanish version of USA Up All Night for the Latin market.

Its western terminus is located at U.S. Route 71 (US 71) north of Savannah. The route travels eastward across the communities of Rosendale, Rea, and Whitesville. The road ends at US 169 in King City, about from its western terminus. The road was designated around 1926, and was completely laid down with gravel by 1936 and paved in asphalt by 1942. Route description J. F. Roberts Octagonal Barn, located on Route 48 The route is located in Andrew and Gentry counties. In 2015, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 876 vehicles traveling on Route 48 east of US 71, and as few as 527 vehicles traveling west of Route B. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Route 48 starts at the intersection of US 71 and County Road 43 (CRD 43) and travels eastward. The road passes by a school and travels through farmland, and turns northeastward at CRD 146. East of CRD 149, the route shifts southward and crosses over the One Hundred and Two River, the city limit of Rosendale. Traversing the northern edge of the city as Main Street, the road intersects Route C, also known as Lake Street. The road soon leaves the town, and begins travelling northeastward again. At CRD 127, the route travels eastward, and enters Rea at CRD 117 as Byers Street. Route 48 intersects four city streets before leaving the city. The entrance to the J. F. Roberts Octagonal Barn, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located past the intersection of Routes 48 and B. The road then intersects the northern terminus of Route D, and crosses over the Platte River. Route 48 intersects CRD 198 and CRD 201 in the unincorporated area of Whitesville, and crosses the Agee Creek past CRD 91 and CRD 200. The road continues through farmland and crosses the Crooked Creek. Between CRD 226 and CRD 227, Route 48 intersects Routes M and P and shifts slightly southward. The road enters Gentry County past CRD 111 and CRD 235. Past CRD 417, the route crosses over the Elm Grove Branch, and the Third Fork after CRD 432. Route 48 enters King City as Empire Avenue, west of its intersection with Route CC. The road continues into the city, intersecting multiple city streets and driveways. The route ends at the intersection with US 169, also known as Connecticut Street inside the city. The road continues as Route Z, which ends at Pattonsburg. History The Route 48 designation first appeared on state maps in 1926, as an unimproved road starting from US 71 and ending at Route 4 in King City. A bridge at the One Hundred and Two River that carried the route was built in 1929, with a cost of $49,087. A large section of Route 4 was designated as US 169 in 1931, including Route 48's eastern terminus, and the Route 48 sections in Gentry County and from US 71 to Rosendale in Andrew Country were improved and had new gravel laid down; the paving costs were $101,176 () and $150,282 () respectively. About two years later, gravel was laid down from Whitesville to the Andrew‚ÄìGentry county line. The remaining section from Rosendale to Whitesville was laid down with gravel by 1936. The first asphalt paving on the route began in 1938, where the Gentry County section was paved first, with a cost of $38,861 (). The rest of the route was paved in asphalt four years later. Route 48 was resurfaced and shoulders were reshaped in 1974 from Rosendale to King City, which cost $435,278.46 (). The bridge at the One Hundred and Two River was replaced by a new bridge in October 2014.

Between 2003 and 2006 Doerck was a member of the defunct laptop group Sagan, alongside Blevin Blectum, Wobbly, and video artist Ryan Junell.  Early years  Born and raised around California, including Willits and San Diego, Doerck began his music career listening to and playing black metal and punk, including a Metallica cover band. In San Diego, he had a job coloring New Kids on the Block comic books using computers. In 1997, he helped form the group Disc with Kid606, M.C. Schmidt and Drew Danial (of Matmos). An interest in electronic music drove Doerck to begin work with record label Vinyl Communications in 1992, adding more electronic flavor to what was otherwise a punk record label. Doerck settled in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1994, where he participated in the drum & bass scene. There he toured with A Minor Forest, and later collaborated with Kid606, publishing a number of records on the label Tigerbeat6. Doerck also played with members of Crash Worship. Doerck's early electronic music influences included Luke Vibert's work released under the alias Plug, which Doerck admits he tried to imitate (with little success).Brave New Waves interview, aired February 22, 2001  2000s  In 2001, Doerck became a live/touring member of Matmos when they toured with Bj√∂rk as an opening act, in addition to playing as supporting musicians in her band on the Vespertine tour. During the same year, his album Gearhound won an Honorable Mention for Digital Musics in the Prix Ars Electronica. In 2002, Doerck released a CD-R entirely in MP3 format, entitled LS-MP3CD-R. This project included hundreds of MP3s produced throughout his musical history, dating back to his first band, The Robotic. In 2004, Doerck remixed \\"Who Is It\\" from Bj√∂rk's Med√∫lla album.

Historically it comprised that part of the original Free Church of Scotland that remained outside the union with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1900. It remains a distinct Presbyterian denomination in Scotland. The Free Church was and still is sometimes colloquially known by the term The Wee Frees, even though, in 21st century Scotland, it is the largest Presbyterian denomination after the national church. Since this term was originally used in comparing the Free Church with the United Free Church (which is now a much smaller denomination), the Free Church of Scotland now deprecates the use of the term. Theology and doctrine The church maintains its strong commitment to the Westminster Confession and Reformed Theology. Its polity is Presbyterian. A complete psalter in modern English was published in 2003. Its offices and theological college remain on The Mound, Edinburgh, although the denomination no longer holds the original Free Church College buildings. The Free Church continues to be evangelical in character, presenting its understanding of the Christian message, namely that Jesus Christ is sole Lord and Saviour. History =Aftermath of the union of 1900= In 1900 the Free Church of Scotland united with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland. However, a minority of the original Free Church remained outside this new union. The protesting and dissenting minority at once claimed to be the legitimate Free Church. They met outside the Free Assembly Hall on 31 October and, failing to gain admission, withdrew to another hall, where they elected Rev Colin Bannatyne as Moderator and held the remaining sittings of their Assembly. It was reported that between 16,000 and 17,000 names had been received of persons adhering to the anti-unionist principle. It has been estimated that the number of Free Church communicants dropped from a little under 300,000 in 1899 to just over 4,000 in 1900. At the Assembly of 1901 it was stated that the Free Church had twenty-five ministers and at least sixty-three congregations, with most being found in the Gaelic- speaking districts of Scotland. The initial problems were obvious: the congregations soon grew in number, but were far apart; there were not nearly enough ministers; the church was treated in a hostile manner by the United Free Church; work was conducted under considerable hardship; and there was little success in appealing to the general popular sentiment of Scotland. However, the revenue of the church gradually increased; in 1901, the sustentation fund was able to support only 75 ministers, but by 1903 it maintained 167. =The Free Church case= After the union of 1900, the United Presbyterian Church and the continuing Free Church not only contested the legacy of the Free Church of 1843‚Äì1900, but also claimed its assets. After attempts at agreement failed, the matter ended in the Scottish courts. The litigation was initially decided in favour of the Free Church by the House of Lords in 1904, on the basis that in the absence of a power to change fundamental doctrines in the trust deed, a dissenting minority retains the property. As it was not possible for the Free Church to use all the property, Parliament intervened, generally securing for the church the congregational property she could effectively use plus a significant share of central assets. =The Church in the 20th century= Free Church in Lonmore. The Free Church of Scotland has historically been known as \\"the church without the steeple.\\" In 1906, a Free Church College was re-established in Edinburgh and by 1925 there were 91 ministers and 170 congregations in 12 presbyteries. The general magazine of the Free Church is The Monthly Record and there are magazines for young people. Two of the professors in the Free Church College began a theological journal the Evangelical Quarterly in 1929, but in 1942 control passed outside the church, initially to Inter Varsity Fellowship. Today the College offers degrees in conjunction with the University of Glasgow. Post-1945, the Free Church engaged with the wider evangelical cause, but after its growth in the early decades, it began a statistical decline that, except for a short period in the 1980s, continued throughout the 20th century. =2000 events= Free Church in Poolewe In the 1980s and 1990s there were allegations of sexual misconduct against Professor Donald Macleod, principal of the Free Church College. No misconduct was ever proven against Professor Macleod; he was tried and acquitted in 1996 in the civil courts. A faction hostile to Macleod pursued the charges in church courts, to no avail. There was considerable dissatisfaction with the handling of the charges, and claims of a cover-up. Anti-Macleod minister Maurice Roberts of the Free Church Defence Association (FCDA) publicly reiterated the accusations, and denounced the General Assembly for its \\"wickedness and hypocrisy\\". He was suspended for contumacy. His supporters demanded his reinstatement and refused to disband the FCDA. In January 2000, 22 FCDA ministers were removed from their pulpits. These and other ministers formed the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) (FCC); they are approximately 20% of the ministerial strength of the pre-2000 Free Church of Scotland. From 2005 to 2010 the Free Church of Scotland saw an 18% drop in its membership. Following the split, the Free Church Continuing sought a declarator from the Court of Session as to ownership of the central funds and properties of the church. In a landmark decision, Lady Paton dismissed their action without granting absolvitor. The Continuing Church then said they would appeal Lady Paton's decision, but ultimately chose not to proceed. In March 2007, the Free Church filed suit to reclaim the church manse at Broadford, Isle of Skye. Lord Uist ruled that the property belonged to the Free Church. The Continuing Church had to pay the expenses of the Free Church. The Continuing Church appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session, which upheld Lord Uist. =List of Moderators= Moderators 1900 to 1931 taken from: Preserving a Reformed Heritage by John KeddieModerators from 1930 to 1939 taken from Proceedings of the Free Church of Scotland 1930 to 1939Moderators 1940 to 1949 taken from Proceedings of the Free Church of Scotland 1940 to 1949 *Very Rev Prof Colin Archibald Bannatyne (Coulter) twice Moderator: 1900/01 and 1906/07 *James Duff MacCulloch (Hope Street, Glasgow) 1901 *Donald MacKinnon Macalister (Edinburgh) 1902 *Angus Galbraith (Lochalsh) 1903 *Murdoch MacQueen (Kiltearn) 1904 *Ewan Macleod (Oban) 1905 *Colin Archibald Bannatyne (Free Church College) 1906 *Murdo Mackenzie (Inverness) 1907 and Interim Moderator J.

At the 2011 census, 10,896 people identified as being \\"Free Church of Scotland.\\" The Free Church has about 100 congregations in Scotland and circa 80 ministers and 12,000 attenders. There has been a rise of attendance in worship services since 2007. About 50 dissenting or former Church of Scotland congregations had been talking about joining the Free Kirk because the Church of Scotland's ordination of openly gay ministers. = Growth = As of 2017, the Free Church had a community of about 12,000 including 5,400 communicants, and is evidencing a greater effort to bring the Gospel to bear upon an increasingly secular society. As of May 2013 the Free Church worship attendance was 12,639, up from 12,431 in 2007. The number of people under 30 increased by 30% since 2007. The church is growing outwith the Western Islands, especially in the bigger cities. Sunday school attendance has grown by 25% in recent years, from 575 to 709 in 2013. In 2013, Murdo Murchison, an elder from Dunblane Free Church gathered a core group to plant a church in Stirling. With some growth it was recognised as a church plant in 2014 by the Glasgow Presbytery, and in 2016 appointed Iain MacAskill as its minister. There had previously been no Free Church in Stirling since 1948. In 2014 two congregations, the North Harris Free Church, and the Stornoway group of the High Free Church Stornoway and two former Kirk ministers have recently joined the Free Church, makes it total about ten former Kirk pastors who have joined the Free Church. North Harris held its first service with around 100 people in attendance. Kirkmuirhill congregation and New Restalrig have also joined. The High Free Church has regularly attracted around 300 people in Stornoway Primary School since leaving the Church of Scotland earlier this year. Stornoway High was previously the Church of Scotland's biggest congregation on the Western Isles. In early 2015 an Inverness Church of Scotland pastor quit, and took some of his flock with him to set up a new Free Church congregation in the west of Inverness. Rev McMillan was unhappy about the Presbytery of Inverness, which voted against controversial plans to give congregations the freedom to appoint a person in a gay relationship if they wished. Other new churches welcomed into the Free Church included a new church in Leith planted originally in association with the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in the USA. and Christ Church, Craigintinney, a new church plant led by David Court. David led most of the congregation of New Restalrig out of the Church of Scotland. In 2015 the Covenant Church in Newmilns, East Ayrshire joined the Free Church. Covenant Church had split from the Church of Scotland in 2013. The number of congregations have grown to 139 in the end of 2015. New churches continue to be planted, such as in Dunfermline and St Andrews and most recently Montrose in November 2015 and Charleston, Dundee in September 2017 by the existing Dundee church. There has been an increase in the numbers applying to the Free Church ministry, and studying in its Saturday course (provided by the Edinburgh Theological Seminary). Worship =Church services= Free Church in Kilmaluag on Skye Typically, Free Church services are at 11 am and 6:30 pm on Sunday Sabbath, or the Lord's Day. A typical order of service is: * A singing of praise * A prayer * A second singing of praise * A reading from the Bible * A third singing of praise * The sermon * A second prayer * A fourth singing of praise * The benediction Intimations may be read out before the first singing (in effect, before the actual service begins) or immediately after the reading, or before the benediction. A 'first' reading may appear between the first singing and the first prayer. This reading will be of relevance to the 'main' reading. A message to the children may appear after the first prayer, and children may depart for Sunday school or Bible class after the second singing. Lay preachers will replace the benediction with a short prayer. =Church music= Since just after the union of 1900 until the events of 2010, only the psalms of the Old Testament (and in a very few instances, paraphrases of other parts of the Bible) were sung during the services. Musical instruments were never used. However, in November 2010, a special plenary assembly took place to debate and vote on allowing the singing of hymns and use of musical instruments in Free Church services. The motion was passed by a narrow margin. A number of ministers insisted on recording their dissent over the decision. One congregation and four ministers resigned over the decision. The November 2010 motion allowed that instruments can be used as an accompaniment and hymns may be sung, though at least one of the items of sung praise must be a psalm; some congregations continue to sing unaccompanied psalms only. In 2003 the church's Psalmody and Praise Committee produced a new Psalter called Sing Psalms. Although of a similar format to the Scottish Psalter it contains metrical versions of the psalms with 21st century vocabulary and grammar.https://freechurch.org/resources/praise/sing-psalms Congregations and affiliations There are over 100 congregations throughout Scotland, one in London and three pastoral charges in North America. The Church has maintained an extensive missionary commitment for its size, with missions in India, Peru and South Africa, which now have self-governing status. Along with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales and the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing), the denomination is one of the three members of the International Conference of Reformed Churches from Great Britain, and one of seven European Christian denominations who founded the European Conference of Reformed Churches. There is a close relationship with the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia. References Bibliography * Cameron, N., et al. (eds.) (1993). Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology.

Alongside Hedley Bull, Martin Wight, Herbert Butterfield, and others, he was one of the founding members of the English school of international relations theory. He was born John Hugh Watson and educated at Rugby and King's College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, where he read History, Watson was taught by Herbert Butterfield (later Sir Herbert, and Regius Professor of History). After a period of travel in central Europe in the late 1930s, he joined the British Diplomatic Service in 1937, taking the nickname Adam \\"after noticing that every head in the Foreign Office seemed to turn when someone asked for John\\".Washington Post obituary During the Second World War he acted as a liaison with the Free French in Cairo, played an unknown role in the Balkans, based in Bucharest, and was finally posted to Moscow, where he witnessed the victory celebrations of 1945, standing alongside the Soviet Politburo (see Problems of Adjustment in the Middle East (1952), 61) and where he remained for the next four years. In 1949 Watson joined the Foreign Office's new Information Research Department (IRD), which the historian Richard Aldrich has described as a 'covert political warfare section', as successor to the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) that had operated during the Second World War. A key figure in this organisation, he was first assistant to its Head, Ralph Murray, with the job of recruiting 'left-of-centre intellectuals' for the production of anti-communist 'grey' propaganda, and was later posted to Washington (Andrew Defty, Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda (Routledge, 2004)). In the USA he served as Britain's 'psywar [psychological warfare] liaison officer' (Aldrich) in Washington between 1950 and sometime in the mid-1950s, before becoming Head of the African Department of the Foreign Office during the Suez Crisis of 1956. He served as Her Majesty's Ambassador to Mali (1960‚Äì61), Senegal, Mauritania and Togo (1960‚Äì62), and finally Cuba (1962‚Äì66). He returned to London in 1966 to spend two years as Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office before retiring early. After a period with British Leyland in the late 1960s, he entered academia, first at the Australian National University, at the invitation of Hedley Bull, and then in the United States, where he was Professor of International Studies at the University of Virginia. In the late 1950s, it is likely that, given his extensive contacts in the United States and together with Kenneth W. Thompson, Watson was instrumental in facilitating the funding of the British Committee on the Theory of International Politics, chaired in its early years by his former supervisor, Butterfield, and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Watson became a member of Committee, attending when he was in the UK, and later becoming its third chairman, in succession to Butterfield and to Martin Wight. He was instrumental in the production of The Expansion of International Society (1984), edited with Hedley Bull, a key text of the English school of international relations. He also wrote a number of other significant works, including The Nature and Problems of the Third World (1968), Diplomacy (1982) and The Evolution of International Society (1992), a wide-ranging comparative study of historical international systems.

The area can be distinguished into two parts, old Silksworth, the original village and township which has existed since the early middle ages, and New Silksworth, the industrial age colliery village which expanded north west of the original settlement. The former colliery being situated to the north west of the village near to the Gilley Law. The population of the ward was 10,931 at the 2011 census. History =Old Silksworth= The area of Silksworth has been subject to human activity since the Bronze Ages, with archaeological sites of ancient Barrows having been discovered on the surrounding hills. The name of the place itself is thought to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and means ‚Äòthe enclosure of a man called Sigelac'. The first reference to the location appeared in the Middle Ages and is first referenced in a list of appendages of South Bishopwearmouth in King Athelstan‚Äôs gift to the See of Durham in 930 AD. The area at some time became a township of Bishopwearmouth, of which neighbouring Farringdon was a hamlet of. =New Silksworth= New Silksworth emerged as a coal mining village in the 19th century. In 1871, according to the Census there were approx 800 people living in the Silksworth and Tunstall areas, the local area was mainly farmland and where most people worked on the land. However about 350 were men and their families who were constructing the new colliery. To exploit the rich coal reserves in the area the Silksworth Colliery shaft was sunk in 1869 funded by the Londonderry Coal company. Ten years later in 1879 the local population had risen to 4707 for the Silksworth and Tunstall areas. The increase in population was mainly due to the migration of people to the area seeking work at the new Silksworth colliery. According to the census returns the miners came from Ireland, Scotland, Cornwell and even from the United States and Germany. The miners and their families had moved to the colliery areas seeking employment and also colliery housing was provided for the miners by the mine owner Lord Londonderry. The miners life was not an easy one, working conditions underground were very dangerous and the work very arduous. When Silksworth Colliery eventually closed in 1971 it was a massive blow to the local community as many of the local people and businesses relied on the colliery for their livelihood. Just about all remnants of the former Silksworth colliery have now gone and the former mine site has since been converted into Silksworth Sports Complex. Facilities at the sports complex include: * Silksworth Ski Slope the North East of England's largest artificial ski slope and activity centre. This is featured on the Sunderland version of the boardgame 'Monopoly'! * Recreational boating lake near Gilley Law which is home to a variety of water fowl birds, ducks, swans and also near the boating lake is a freshwater fishing lake. * Silksworth Community Swimming Pool, Tennis and Wellness Centre formally The Puma Centre including a children's Outdoor Adventure Play Area which is a great facility for kids and toddlers with swings, zip wire, climbing frames, slides, sand pit and pic nic area etc. * Athletics Running track * All weather floodlit football pitches * Skateboard park (Near the Ski slope) Notable buildings: DOXFORD HOUSE formerly SILKSWORTH HOUSE. Doxford House is a derelict 18th century manor house adjacent Doxford Park in the Silksworth area of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. It is a Grade II* listed building The manor house formerly known as Silksworth House, was constructed in 1775‚Äì1780 by William Johnson who on his death in 1792 left the property in his will to his friend Hendry Hopper. In 1831 Priscilla Hopper then heiress to the estate married William Beckwith of Thurcroft. He was High Sheriff of Durham in 1857. The Beckwiths moved to Shropshire in about 1890 and the house was let out. In 1902, Charles David Doxford of (William Doxford & Sons Ship Builders) brother of Theodore Doxford, took out a 99-year lease on the 24-acre (97,000 m2) estate. On his death in 1935, his daughter, Aline Doxford bought out the lease. On her death in 1968, she bequeathed the house and estate to Sunderland Corporation who gave the house its present name Doxord House and turned the gardens of house into Doxford Park. In 1989 the house became a student's hall of residence for Sunderland University and from about 2000 to 2006 was occupied by the Lazarus Foundation, a drug rehabilitation charity. Plans to turn the house into apartments were proposed in 2008 but the conversion of the house into apartments was never carried out. The latest proposal for re development of Doxford House is to restore the property back into a private family residence with work ongoing in 2014. The Miners Hall, Blind Lane, Silksworth The Miners Hall is located in Blind Lane, Silksworth. The hall is a prominent building in Blind Lane and was built in 1893. The hall was a spacious building constructed of brick and stone. The building was used as a meeting place for the miners and their families, it was also used for social events, Wedding receptions, Engagements etc. The Silksworth Colliery Brass Band also practiced and performed in the hall. The Miners hall front facade and roof was recently refurbished. The hall is now currently used as a builders storage facility. St Matthews Church, C of E Church, Silksworth St Matthew's Church opened in 1872 three years after Silksworth Colliery opened in 1869, the Church played a large part in the formation of the new mining community of Silksworth with the input of miners and their families. St Leonard's RC Church, Silksworth. St. Leonard's Roman Catholic Church opened in 1873, four years after Silksworth Colliery opened in 1869, the funding for the building of the church and rectory being provided by Priscilla Maria Beckwith of Silksworth House.

Early life and education  Born in Hereford, he was the only son of Leonard Radford Welch (1894‚Äì1969) and his wife, Dorothy Perkins (1897‚Äì1982), who trained as an artist before their marriage in 1923. = Childhood = When Robert was young, the family moved to the village of Colwall, which sits on the side of the Malvern Hills and, in 1939, to West Malvern, Worcestershire where he grew up. He had a lifelong love of the Malvern Hills and often walked there. He was educated at the boys' school in Colwall, then at Lyttelton Grammar School in Malvern where he sang in Malvern Priory choir and finally Hanley Castle Grammar School where he excelled at sport. He briefly played cricket for the Second XI of Worcestershire County Cricket Club, before deciding to study at Malvern School of Art. = Malvern School of Art and Birmingham College of Art = His time at Malvern was broken up by two years of National Service, during which time he served as a wireless operator in the Royal Air Force. While in the RAF he attended classes at Cambridge School of Art before returning to complete his studies at Malvern, 1949‚Äì50. He had undertaken rudimentary metalwork classes at Malvern, or 'metal-bashing' as it was known, however he officially began his training as a silversmith at the Birmingham College of Art, School of Silversmithing and Jewellery which was also where he completed his National Diploma in Design. Welch made his first work in a precious metal, a powder bowl, in 1950 but examples of his work in metals survive from as early as 1946. = Royal College of Art and Scandinavia = He went on to study at the Royal College of Art in 1952, the year after the Festival of Britain, joining David Mellor and Gerald Benney who were both a year above him. Welch was the only silversmith in his year. All three were to become renowned in their field, creating \\"remarkable one-off commissions in silver, as well as tackling production designs in newly fashionable and affordable stainless steel. During the 1950s they had all been influenced to a large degree by the Scandinavian Modern style, especially the anthropomorphic vessels and jewellery of the Danish sculptor-designer Henning Koppel for Georg Jensen.\\" Lesley Jackson As a student, Welch made four extended visits to Scandinavia, studying in Stockholm and working with the Norwegian silversmith Theodor Olsen. Scandinavian modernism made a huge impression on him, instilling a love of functional precision and the clean line. In his final year at the Royal College of Art, he decided to focus his studies on designing for stainless steel and wrote his thesis on The Design and Production of Stainless Steel Tableware whilst focusing his final projects on the development of its look. ‚ÄúI felt that the first thing that had to be done was to establish a style for stainless ware which would be expressive of the material itself. A strong, tough, but not intractable medium, but one which was still the captive of the older materials. For instance, tableware in stainless steel was still being made in mirror finish only, and that seemed to me to have all the qualities of chromium-plated ware. It was a long way from the satin finish which was already coming in from Scandinavia. It seemed to me that this beautiful finish possessed just that note of severity which stainless steel seems to demand. Stainless steel needed to have its own appearance, not that of other metals, and the design had to go hand in hand with the function of the piece and that individual appearance.\\" Robert Welch  Design career  = Industrial Design = Welch successfully sold one of his prototype designs to J. & J. Wiggin before he left college. A small family firm in Bloxwich, north of Birmingham, J. & J. Wiggin was the only British manufacturer of stainless steel tableware, marketing pieces under the brand Old Hall. Welch did some work for the firm whilst still a student and in 1955, he was appointed as their consultant designer, an association which lasted until the firm closed in 1984. His geometrical ideal suited the material, and his passion for precision suited the factory. In 1955 Welch established a workshop and studio in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire in a silk mill that had formerly been the home of Charles Robert Ashbee's Guild and School of Handicraft. He had chosen this area because it was easy for him to visit the Wiggins' factory in Bloxwich, his parents' home in West Malvern, as well as London ‚Äì where he would eventually travel for teaching posts, but it would remain a base for the rest of his working life. ‚ÄúThe village has an enduring quality and permanence about it which has permeated Robert's work\\" Jeremy Myerson The industrial design side of the business, Robert Welch Associates, produced work for clients including Royal Doulton, British Railways, Guinness, BOAC, H. E. Lauffer, Carl Prinz and Poole Pottery. = Silversmithing = Robert Welch continued to work in silver throughout his career, creating elegant one-off designs in response to commissions for ecclesiastical, institutional, ceremonial and domestic plate. In the late 1950s, the silversmith and artist John Limbrey (1933‚Äì2013), who had also previously studied silversmithing at Birmingham, came on a visit to the Cotswolds. He knocked on the door of the studio-workshop and said \\"What a nice place to work, do you want any help?\\" He began working with Welch in 1958, from which point he was largely responsible for making most of the commissioned ecclesiastical and domestic silverware. He remained as silversmith, model maker and draughtsman until well into the 21st century. In 1960, Prince Philip commissioned Robert Welch to design and produce a silver trophy, known as the Prince Philip Silver Wink, which has been awarded since 1961 to the top British university tiddlywinks team competing in inter- university matches. = Inspiration = ‚ÄúEarly on I was inspired by architecture, by Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Marcel Breuer. I went to see Corbusier's Ronchamp chapel just after it was built. But lately, my sources of inspiration have been painters and sculptors, Brancusi and Giacometti, for example.\\" Robert Welch ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of these questions which is always asked: ‚ÄòWhere does one draw one‚Äôs inspiration from?‚Äô. There is no one source, one just sort of reacts to life, rather like a light meter, you can see things under any conditions, in any circumstances. Of course consciously one can keep one‚Äôs mind alert; I like to spend a great deal of time in museums, I like to carefully study all sorts of things, I enjoy looking and browsing through books on old silver, books on old iron. Inspiration can come from anywhere, from bubbles, from looking at a beehive, from looking at a birds nest, anything can happen. It‚Äôs just one of these things which cannot be really pinpointed, you just (...) are alert and aware and receptive, and somehow things just happen.‚Äù Robert Welch  Awards and honours  1962 Elected FSIA (Fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists) 1965 Elected RDI (Royal Designer for Industry) ‚Äì a faculty within the Royal Society of Arts 1979 Awarded MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire)  Selected designs  Dates denote year/s of design, year of first production may be later 1956 Campden tableware and cutlery range, named after Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire where his studio was based.

Founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, it was based first in Cannstatt (today Bad Cannstatt, a city district of Stuttgart). Daimler died in 1900, and their business moved in 1903 to Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim after the original factory was destroyed by fire, and again to Berlin in 1922. Other factories were located in Marienfelde (near Berlin) and Sindelfingen (next to Stuttgart). The enterprise began to produce petrol engines but after the success of a small number of race cars built on contract by Wilhelm Maybach for Emil Jellinek, it began to produce the Mercedes model of 1902. After this automobile production expanded to become DMG's main product, and it built several models. Because of the post World War One German economic crisis, DMG merged in 1926 with Benz & Cie., becoming Daimler-Benz and adopting Mercedes-Benz as its automobile trademark. A further merger occurred in 1998 with Chrysler Corporation to become DaimlerChrysler. The name was finally changed to just Daimler AG in 2007 when Chrysler was sold.  Daimler, Maybach, and DMG at Seelberg  DMG employees in 1890 By 1882 both Daimler and Maybach had left Nikolaus Otto's Deutz AG Gasmotorenfabrik. In 1890 they founded their own engine business, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG). Its purpose was the construction of small, high speed engines they had developed based on the same stationary engine technology. DMG thus grew out of an extension of the independent businesses of Daimler and Maybach, who would revolutionize the world with their inventions for the automobile of a four-stroke petrol engine, carburetor, and so on. They would manufacture small internal combustion engines suitable for use on land, sea, and in the air (the basis for a symbol Daimler devised of a three pointed star, with each point indicating a different way). On July 5, 1887, Daimler purchased a property in Seelberg Hill (Cannstatt) previously owned by Zeitler & Missel who had used it as a precious metal foundry. The site covered 2,903 square meters, cost 30,200 Goldmark, and from it they produced engines for their successful Neckar motorboat. They also sold licences for others to make their engine products and Seelberg became a centre of the rapidly growing automobile industry. Daimler ran into financial problems because sales were not high enough and the licences didn't yield significant profit. An agreement was reached with the financiers Max Von Duttenhofer and William Lorenz, both of whom were also munitions manufacturers, along with the influential banker Kilian von Steiner, who owned an investment bank, to convert the private business to a public corporation in 1890. (This agreement is regarded by some historians as a \\"devil's pact\\", as the inventors never got along with the new status.) Not really believing in automobile production the financiers expanded the stationary engine business, as they were selling well, and even considered a merger with Otto's Deutz-AG. (During 1882, Gottflieb Daimler had serious personal problems with Nicholas Otto, when Daimler and Maybach worked for Otto.) Daimler and Maybach continued to advocate car manufacturing and as a result even left DMG for a short period. Daimler's friend, Frederick Simms, persuaded the financiers to take Gottflieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach back into faltering DMG in early 1896. Their business was re-merged with DMG's. Daimler was appointed General Inspector, Maybach chief Technical Director and Simms a director of DMG.Lord Montagu and David Burgess-Wise Daimler Century ; Stephens 1995 In 1892, Maybach designed the Ph√∂nix, an inline two-cylinder engine fitted with a new carburetor.Wise, David Burgess. \\"Daimler: Founder of the Four-Wheeler\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.483. Following the withdrawal of Gottlieb Daimler and Maybach to their own business to concentrate on cars, the enterprise had been close to a crisis but stabilised itself, selling mobile and stationary engines through a number of retailers around the world, from New York City to Moscow. The first Daimler car, a singularly inelegant model, appeared in 1892,Wise, p.483. followed in 1895 by a two-cylinder vis √° vis and, in 1897, DMG's first front-engined model, a Ph√∂nix-engined four-seat open tourer.Wise, p.482 caption. In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler died. Later DMG's successful Mercedes models based upon race cars designed by Wilhelm Maybach to the specifications of Emil Jellinek (who wanted a more modern and safer car, following the death of Willhelm Bauer in a Daimler racer)Georgano, G.N. Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886‚Äì1930 (London: Grange-Universal, 1990), p.39. changed the board's outlook in favour of the automobile. Maybach continued as designer for a while, but quit in 1909 and was replaced by Gottlieb's son, Paul.  Expansion (1902 to 1920)  DMG's automobile sales took off, particularly with the first Daimler- Mercedes engine designed by Maybach placed into several race cars of 1900 built for Emil Jellinek. That race car was later referred to as the Mercedes 35 hp. Production capacity was extended to Untert√ºrkheim. In 1902, DMG produce the first Mercedes models, led by the 60, the most famous early model, and officially adopted Mercedes as its automobile trademark; capable of 120 km/h (75 mph), the 60 combined touring and racing capacity, and was the top-status car to own (or for other makers, among them Berliet, Rochet-Schneier, Martini, Ariel, Star and FIAT, to copy; in the U.S., Daimler Manufacturing Company {Long Island, New York} may have built one under licence in association with Steinway).Georgano, G.N., p.41. In part due to the model 60's success, the number of DMG employees went from 821 (1903) to 2,200 (1904). 1906 to 1913 were further expansion years, with the creation of new capacity reducing the number of external suppliers. Increased mechanization took the annual productivity from 0.7 cars per worker, to 10. In 1911, shares of DMG were listed on the Stuttgart stock exchange. = Berlin-Marienfelde = On October 2, 1902, DMG opened a new works in the mountainous region to the south of Berlin. Its scope was initially limited to motorboat and marine engines. Later, it expanded into making trucks (1905) and fire trucks (1907). The region became a centre of the automobile industry, and other businesses moved in. = Untert√ºrkheim = Untert√ºrkheim was an ideal location to site a large factory as it was close to both the Neckar river and the Stuttgart‚ÄìUlm railway. The local Mayor Eduard Fiechtner sold the land (185,000 square meters) at a low price and also arranged for a railroad extension with its own station and energy from the Neckar's hydro-electric plant which had been built in 1900. DMG had planned to open the facility in 1905 but the total destruction of Cannstatt's factory by fire in 1903 hastened the work and the new Art-Nouveau building, with a jagged-roof, was brought forward to start production in December 1903. The work force continued to grow. On May 17, 1904, Unterturkheim became DMG's headquarters with the rest of the administration staff moving in on 29 May. In 1913, an additional 220,000 square meters were acquired and between 1915 and 1918 it was extended further. By the 1920s, Untert√ºrkheim had almost all the production processes on one site from foundries to final car assembly. In 1925 the DMG design department also moved in. = The Cannstatt Fire (1903) = On the night of June 10, 1903, the original Seelberg-Cannstatt plant suffered a great fire. All the machinery and 93 finished Mercedes cars, a quarter of the annual production, were destroyed, together with a small museum with historical items like Daimler-Maybach's first ever motorcycle, the Reitwagen. The displaced workers received haven-salaries and additional bread rations. Neighboring businesses lent workshops, allowing production to continue. DMG created a Relief Fund (one of the first worker insurance schemes) and began building separator blocks in all its plants. The following year, 1904, the whole operation moved to Untert√ºrkheim. The last unit produced in Seelberg rolled out in the first weeks of 1905. = Sindelfingen = At the outbreak of the First World War, in 1914, there was a rush to produce war supplies. In the autumn of 1915, DMG opened the Sindelfingen factory for military vehicles, aircraft engines, and even entire aircraft. After the war, limited by the Versailles Treaty, it produced only automobile bodies.  Motorboats  The production of motorboats by Daimler and Maybach began early, in 1886, with the Neckar (4.5 meters long with a speed of 11 km/h (6 knots)), the first in the world, and tested on the local Neckar river. That boat became DMG's first commercial hit, helped by the poor state of Germany's roads. Once the public corporation was formed, motorboat production became one of the new financiers' main interests and lead in 1902 to the building of the Berlin-Marienfelde factory specifically for their manufacture.  Automobiles  DMG truck (1898) with Phoenix engine 1912 Mercedes Knight 4.0 50Hp at Technikmuseum Sinsheim Daimler had sold automobile-engine licences all over the world including to France, Austria, the UK, and the United States through an agreement with the piano-maker Steinway, in New York. The first DMG automobile sale took place in August 1892 (its registration still survives) to the Sultan of Morocco. Commercial vehicles had also been made mainly using a Phoenix engine, but up to 1900, when Daimler died, the bodies had not been standardised. In 1902, the Mercedes car was built, compact and modern, with many improved features, a move which sparked the board's interest in automobile production. Mercedes then became DMG's main car brand name. There were some small exceptions: the Mercedes Simplex of 1902‚Äì1909, (the name indicating it being \\"easy to drive\\") and the Mercedes Knight of 1910‚Äì1924, featuring Coventry Daimler's development of Charles Yale Knight's sleeve-valve engine. All models were priced by their hp- rating. The first truck, of 1.5 tons payload, was sold to London's British Motor Syndicate Ltd on October 1, 1896. Its rear-mounted Phoenix engine produced at 700 rpm. In 1897, the production of light commercial vehicles began. At that time they were popularly called business vehicles, and were very successful in the United Kingdom. At the first Paris Motor Show, in 1898, a 5-ton truck was displayed, with a front-mounted engine. = Phoenix (1894) = In 1894, while working from temporary premises in the unused Hermann Hotel in Cannstatt, Gottlieb Daimler, his son Paul, and Wilhelm Maybach designed the Phoenix engine. It amazed the automobile world with: * four cylinders placed vertical and parallel (a first for an automobile engine) * camshaft-operated exhaust valves * spray-nozzle carburetor (patented by Maybach in 1893) * improvements in the belt-drive system. Production of this engine which was put into cars, trucks, and boats became DMG's main product until the Mercedes car of 1902. = Mercedes (1900) = In 1902 an automobile that would later be called the Mercedes 35 hp was created by Maybach to the order of the successful Austrian merchant Emil Jellinek who became fascinated by both the Phoenix engine and race cars. The name was derived from an engine Maybach built to the specifications of Jellinek in 1900 that could achieve . Jellinek had stipulated that the engine be called Daimler-Mercedes and when it was successful, he stipulated a new model in an edition of vehicles that he would market and use personally. Later this was referred to as the Mercedes model. It was never marketed by DMG until its success was seen to be substantial. Jellinek competed as a driver, painting \\"Mercedes\\" (Spanish for godsend), on the automobiles he raced after his 10-year-old daughter. Jellinek's pursuit of higher speed brought him to Stuttgart personally, to Wilhelm Maybach's office where he also met with Paul Daimler, son of Gottlieb. Together they designed a new kind of automobile that would be \\"larger, wider, and with a lower center of gravity\\". A small number would be produced for Jellinek under contract. This was the first true automobile designed by DMG, as opposed to a coach with an engine fitted into it. Blending the technical refinements of Maybach's new 4-cylinder engine, with a new chassis the automobile stunned the motorsport world of 1901. Jellinek had promised to purchase a large number of the race cars, (36 units for 550,000 Goldmark), if he could also be the sole concessionaire in Austria-Hungary, France, Belgium, and the US, using the name Daimler-Mercedes for the engine, and also become a member of the Board of Management. In June 1902, after DMG realized that they had already conceded their Daimler trademark to Panhard & Levassor for the whole of France, they decided to name all their cars Mercedes after the engine and began to produce the Mercedes series. The great demand for the car soon had DMG operating at full-capacity. = Racing = In these early years, car races were used as advertising for their makers. Therefore, both DMG and Benz & Cie., their great rival, put the best of their cars on the track. Daimler cars were able to beat Benz until 1908, when a Benz achieved the land speed record, but in the following years, both brands were equal.  First automobile multinational  DMG expanded with a subsidiary company in Austria * Austro-Daimler Austro Daimler 's Imperial trademark  International licences  = French licences = Edouard Sarazin began early negotiations to license Gottlieb Daimler's engines in France. After his death, his wife finally succeeded, helped by √âmile Levassor and Ren√© Panhard (then a timber-machinery manufacturers) selling their first engine in 1887. Armand Peugeot, one of their clients, began fitting vehicles with Panhard & Levassor engines, and acquired Daimler's licence from them. Peugeot focused, successfully, on the German market. Panhard & Levassor designed a complete automobile. Levassor mounted an engine (Daimler's) over the front axle, giving better balance and turning. Marketed in October 1891, it featured rear wheel drive by two side chains, pedal clutch, front radiator, and steering by lever. Historians consider that the automobile was \\"a German invention, while France expanded it commercially\\", mainly by publicity from car-racing since in January 1886 Karl Benz was granted the first patent for an automobile he designed and built in 1885. = American licences= In 1888, Gottlieb Daimler established a cooperation with the German-born piano maker William Steinway in Astoria, Queens, later New York City, to build stationary and marine engines for gas and petroleum, and later on, 1892, also to build cars as full copies of the German design. The engines and cars were produced in Steinway's premises of the \\"Rikers plant\\" opposite of Rikers Island which is in use for piano production until nowadays. This business was sold after William Steinway died in 1896. = British licences, The Daimler Motor Company Limited = DS420 Daimler Double-Six 50 alloy V12 Corsica drophead coup√© body designed by Reid Railton (1931) In 1890 Hamburg-born Frederick Simms, a consulting engineer and a good personal friend of Gottlieb Daimler returned to the United Kingdom with the Phoenix engine for launches (though expressing thoughts for cars) having obtained from him British (and British Empire) rights to the Daimler patents. In 1893 Simms formed The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited (DMS). At the end of 1895 Simms received an offer from a London company promoter called Lawson of, at first, ¬£35,000 to purchase all the Daimler rights. As part of the necessary arrangements, Maybach and Daimler having parted from DMG, Simms arranged to pay the now drifting DMG ¬£17,100 on the condition that DMG took back Gottlieb Daimler. A 'contract of reassociation' was signed on November 1, 1895. The result was the divided Daimler-Maybach and DMG businesses then merged and were rejuvenated. In early 1896, having agreed with Daimler Motor Syndicate it would buy the Daimler rights, Lawson floated The Daimler Motor Company Limited (DMC) in London (with Gottlieb Daimler a director), the works to be in a disused cotton mill in Coventry. Simms became a director of DMG (Cannstatt) but not DMC (London). In 1910 Daimler Motor Company while retaining a separate identity, merged ownership with that of BSA (munitions), and began producing military vehicles. It also dropped the word motor from its name. For over 65 years, The Daimler Company Limited produced a wide variety of premium quality vehicles including very many buses, ambulances, fire engines and some trucks but in particular medium-sized and large cars which were often very expensive. Their vehicles were distinguished by their finned exposed radiators, later by scalloped radiator shells. Until the early 1950s it was often said \\"the aristocracy buy Daimlers, the nouveau riche buy Rolls-Royce\\". In 1960 the business was sold to Jaguar, which soon engaged in badge-engineering and often Jaguar and Daimler cars could only be distinguished by the grille and name badge. In 2005 the only Daimler models being produced were luxury models, such as the Daimler Super Eight. The Daimler name moved with Jaguar into British Leyland, back to an independent Jaguar, and then into Ford. In July 2008 Tata Group, the current owners of Jaguar and Daimler, announced they were considering transforming Daimler into \\"a super-luxury marque to compete directly with Bentley and Rolls-Royce\\".The Times July 28, 2008 An application to register the Daimler name as a trademark in the US was rejected in 2009 later that year Jaguar lost the right to trademark the Daimler name in the United States.USPTO 77035168  Airships and fixed-wing aircraft  Daimler built the engine for the first airship fuelled by petrol in 1888. From 1899 to 1907 DMG provided Maybach designed engines to Zeppelin. Wilhelm Maybach quit DMG in 1909. After 1909 Maybach and his son Karl founded their own enterprise in W√ºrttemberg and took over supplying the engines. During the First World War, from 1915 the Sindelfingen factory produced large numbers of winged aircraft and aircraft engines. Production was prohibited after the conflict under conditions laid down by the Treaty of Versailles. =Aircraft= * Daimler D.I * Daimler G.I * Daimler L11 * Daimler L14  Three-pointed star: land, water and air  In the 1870s, while working for Otto at Deutz AG Gasmotorenfabrik in Cologne, Daimler sent his wife Emma Kunz a postcard, marking his residence with a three-pointed star and writing: \\"one day this star will shine over our triumphant factories\\". Since then, this line has inspired both Daimler and Maybach when developing light and powerful engines for \\"land, water, and air\\". In the 1900s, after the Mercedes' success, DMG was still lacking a trademark. Paul and Adolf Daimler, the sons of Gottlieb (who had died in early March 1900), suggested using that symbol. Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft's board accepted the proposal in June 1909, also registering a four-pointed one. The four-pointed star became the emblem of Deutsche Aerospace AG (DASA) in the 1980s and then the logo of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). The three-pointed star debuted in 1910. In 1916, it was surrounded by a circle with four additional stars, with either the name Mercedes or of the respective factory (Untert√ºrkheim or Berlin-Marienfelde). In 1937, the familiar symbol was registered by Daimler-Benz, a three-dimensional three-pointed star, contained in a circle.  German crisis (1920s)  DMG was one of the most important German businesses at the time of the German crisis; tripling its capital to 100 million shares in 1920, and moving its headquarters to Berlin in 1922. After the war the German automobile industry stagnated because of insufficient demand and because automobiles were taxed by the government as luxury items. The country also was hit by a petrol shortage. In 1923, DMG production fell to 1,020 units, compared to Benz & Cie. making 1,382 in Mannheim. The average cost of a car was 25 million marks. Strike action and inflation pushed DMG to the limit. To survive DMG produced Mercedes bicycles and typewriters, and it even issued its own emergency money.  Daimler-Benz and the Mercedes-Benz brand (1926)  For the two separate businesses to survive the financial problems of the day, in 1919, Benz & Cie. proposed a merger, but DMG formally rejected it in December. Then, as the German crisis worsened, the struggling firms met again in 1924 and signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. They standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising‚Äîmarketing their car models jointly‚Äîalthough keeping their respective brands. On June 28, 1926, DMG and Benz & Cie. merged into Daimler-Benz AG, establishing its headquarters in the Untert√ºrkheim factory. Unable to use Daimler on all their products their automobiles were branded Mercedes Benz in honour of DMG's most successful car model and the last name of Karl Benz. Its new trademark consisted of a three- pointed star surrounded by the traditional laurels of Karl Benz's logo and labelled Mercedes Benz. The next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918, and diesel truck production was launched.  Trivia  * In 1890, DMG was delivering stationary and marine engines to Russia. In 1910, it opened its first dealership in Moscow. From 1912, it was a purveyor to the Russian Royal Court. Even after the war and the socialist revolution, the Mercedes won most of the great show competitions it entered in Russia. * In 1892, DMG designated Otto Speidel as its Munich representative. * In 1896, Bavarian Engine & Automobile also began to sell their products, naming Karl Moll as representative in 1898. * In 1910, it opened a shop for trucks, buses and motorboats in Hiltenspergerstrasse 21. * In 1914, in Paris, one of the greatest races in history took place, with 37 cars of six manufacturers from six countries. To beat the favorite Peugeot team, DMG used an aircraft engine designed by Paul Daimler and Fritz Nallinger. It was built by the automobile department but tested by the airship department. The cars produced at 3100 rpm (no Mercedes had exceeded 1,500 rpm before then). It had four steel cylinders (M93654), and sixteen valves, an aluminum crankcase, crankshafts of special Austrian steel, a single camshaft, and displaced 4,483 cc. * In 1921, DMG presented the supercharged Mercedes Kompressormotor, successful in both the private market and on the race track.

It is located north of Dessie, in the Debub Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region (or kilil). The town of Hayq is to the west of the lake. Lake Hayq is 6.7 km long and 6 km wide, with a surface area of 23 km¬≤. It has a maximum depth of 88 m and is at an elevation of 2,030 meters above sea level. It is one of two lakes in the Tehuledere woreda.  History  According to a local legend, the lake was created to avenge a pregnant woman who was wronged by a princess. God was greatly angered by this injustice, and in his wrath turned all of the land surrounding the woman (except the ground she was sitting on) into the water forming a lake, destroying the princess along with her friends and family in the process. Where the pregnant woman was sitting became an island (now a peninsula) where Istifanos Monastery, founded in the middle of the 13th century by Iyasus Mo'a, is located. A former student of Iyasus Mo'a, Tekle Haymanot, went on to found the monastery of Debra Asbos (renamed in the 15th century to Debre Libanos) in Shewa.Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 110. Tekle Haymanot was one of five bright young religious students who became the \\"five lights of Christianity\\" for the south of Ethiopia. Iyasus Mo'a also played a role in Yekuno Amlak's overthrow of the Zagwe dynasty, and helped restore the Solomonic dynasty. Upon Yekuno Amlak's ascension to the throne, Istifanos Church became Istifanos Monastery.Taddesse Tamrat, pp. 66-7. The church was established around the 8th century during the Axumite era and was the first one in what was then the Amhara province. The events surrounding its establishment, however, are not clear. Some legends suggest that there was an Aksumite palace in Ambasselle opposite the modern Istifanos monastery, located on the opposite side of the Lake Hayq. Imam Ahmad Gragn looted and burned this church in November, 1531.This is how Taddesse Tamrat (Church and State, p. 36) interprets its date of 720 in the Futuh al-Habasha. Pankhurst's note on this passage proposes a different interpretation, that the existing church had been built in AH 720, which would have been the first year of the reign of Emperor Newaya Krestos, whom the author of the Futuh credits built the church. (Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst [Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003], p. 265 and n. 614) The ruins of the church are still visible, and the legend states that the kings and princes who lived in that palace established the church. The first known European to view the lake was Francisco √Ålvares, who passed near it 21 September 1520. He mentions the lake had hippopotamuses and catfish, and the land around it was planted in lemons, oranges, and citrons.

It is one of the larger concert venues in the San Diego area. The venue is currently owned and operated by Live Nation. History Area around the amphitheatre had previously been open fields and at one time been part of a large dairy farm. At one point, the 72 acres where the amphitheater sits was a fully developed industrial park with terraced lots and utilities in place. The site had lain fallow for a number of years, when Universal Concerts approached the city of Chula Vista and won approval to build the amphitheatre. The industrial park was bulldozed and the site graded to build the amphitheatre. In the late 1990s, a development plan was created and a water park and concert venue were planned for the area. White Water Canyon (now Aquatica San Diego) opened in 1997, while Coors Amphitheatre opened July 21, 1998, the first venue of its kind in San Diego County. A month later, on August 21, 1998, the venue hosted its first sell-out concert with English pop girl group Spice Girls. All of the Universal Concerts facilities, including Coors Amphitheatre, were purchased by House of Blues in late 1999. Live Nation Entertainment purchased House of Blues, including 8 amphitheaters and eleven clubs, in July 2006. In April 2008, the venue was renamed Cricket Wireless Amphitheatre after naming rights were purchased by Cricket Wireless. In January 2013, the venue was renamed to Sleep Train Amphitheater after the naming rights were purchased by Sleep Train, as part a five-year naming rights deal with Live Nation. On February 16, 2017, Sleep Train Amphitheatre was renamed to Mattress Firm Amphitheatre, to coincide with its partnership with Mattress Firm.

Her work is featured at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and collections of the Chase Manhattan Bank, the San Francisco Arts Commission, and the Downey Museum. She was the founder of the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in Sacramento.  Biography  Barbara Pincus was born in New York City in 1928. Her father was Spanish and her mother was Russian Jewish. She earned a bachelor of arts in 1955 from Hunter College. Pincus married Frank Taffet in 1949. When Taffet died in 1973, she changed her name to Maria Alquilar. Beginning in the 1980s Alquilar lived in Santa Cruz, California and Miami, Florida. Alquilar spent her early life working as both a teacher and a social worker. Her gaze shifted to art when in 1970, she and Colette Garrison opened the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in Old Sacramento. Alquilar focused on expressionistic and figurative imagery and showcased artists such as Anne Gregory, Ken Little, Joan Moment and Mary Warner. She later became the sole owner of the gallery, and took it with her when she moved to Lake of the Pines and then Roseville. She eventually returned to Sacramento, installing the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in a shared space with the Himovitz/Solomon Gallery. In 1986, Alquilar sold the Jennifer Pauls Gallery to focus on her own art. She was well known for using bright, vibrant colors and dreamy imagery. She created over a multitude of mediums. She is most well known for her ceramic murals, many of which can be seen throughout Sacramento. In 2004, she was commissioned by the city of Livermore, California to create a mural for the city's new public library. When the $40,000 mural was unveiled in October 2004, the names of two books and 11 prominent historical figures, such as Albert Einstein, were misspelled. She initially refused to fix the mural, citing artistic license. However, she quietly returned to correct the misspellings the following summer.

As of the 2010s, the most familiar variety of mass-produced circus peanuts is orange-colored and flavored with an artificial banana flavor. These are typically made from sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, pectin, soy protein, food coloring and artificial flavor. Confectioners originally distributed an orange-flavored variety that was only available seasonally due to a lack of packaging capable of preserving the candy. In the spring, five-and-dimes sold circus peanuts as penny candy. In the 1940s, circus peanuts became one of the many candies to become available year-round owing to the industrial proliferation of cellophane packaging. Over the years, confectioners have also offered circus peanuts colored yellow, pink, and white, including a variety of flavors, though orange is still the most predominant color and banana the most common flavor.

The business started to decline after the Second World War as shopping moved away from Oldham Street, and in the 1950s Debenhams added the store to their portfolio. Debenhams also owned another Manchester department store, Pauldens, and the continued decline of the area led to the closure of Affleck & Brown in 1973. Affleck's Palace early history Affleck's Palace first opened in 1982 by James and Elaine Walsh with an ethos of offering a safe environment for entrepreneurs to start out with affordable rent and no long-term contracts. Unit holders operated under a licence agreement which allowed them to pay for space on a week by week basis. The atmosphere and colourful maze-like layout led to Affleck's becoming a mecca for alternative culture. The establishment was able to bounce back from two building fires and overcame many obstacles. During the 1990s 'Madchester Summer of Love' period, when local bands like the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets were at the height of their popularity; Affleck's Palace was a fashionable spot to get oversized flared jeans and tie dyed T-shirts and 'Eastern Bloc' was a popular record shop as it dealt in all the latest underground dance tunes of the time. Modern history On 31 March 2008, Affleck's Palace ceased trading. It re-opened on 1 April 2008 as Afflecks under new management. Afflecks is now managed by Mancunian property developer Bruntwood after the expiry of a 25-year lease in 2007. It had been previously suggested that Bruntwood would redevelop the building, possibly leading to its closure as a market, with many traders having feared that closure would be likely and that notice could have been given as soon as the end of January. Following the change in management a representative of the property developer is quoted as saying: > Never in our 30-year history have we bought one of our customers' businesses > but Afflecks is a Manchester icon that we wanted to protect. We aren't > however expert in managing markets, so will look for a suitable long term > owner. Afflecks Palace currently has over 73 businesses operating inside of it, the majority of which are alternative clothing, record shops and retro game shops. Afflecks also has a variety of cafes. The independent markets have continued to be popular with one million visitors in 2012. All 73 units are fully let and attract an average of 24,000 shoppers every week, including 7,000 on Saturdays.

These fish are found on the continental shelf in the temperate or subarctic waters of the North Pacific. They are a well-known family in the littoral zone from southern California north to the Aleutian Islands. The most commercially important species is the lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a common food fish. Most hexagrammids are small to moderate in size, averaging around 50 cm, although the lingcod can be much larger. Like many other scorpaeniform species, they have broad, spiny pectoral, dorsal, and anal fins. They are scavengers but also catch and eat small fish and bottom-dwelling animals such as crabs. They can be found off rocky shorelines, in kelp beds, and, especially during spawning, in shallow inlets and tidepools. The kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus) is a popular sport fish, and although it is not commercially valuable, it is considered a delicious food catch.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1922 as a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and later sat in the House of Commons of Canada from 1935 to 1940 as a Liberal-Progressive. McDonald was born in Lucknow, Ontario, the son of Donald McDonald and Mary McKenzie, and was educated in Kincardine. After completing his schooling, he taught school in Kinloss. He later moved to Manitoba, and worked as an agricultural implement dealer and insurance agent in Boissevain. In 1914, he married Jennie M. Taylor. He first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 campaign, but lost to Conservative incumbent James Johnson by 62 votes. In 1915, the Conservative government of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid a corruption scandal. A new election was held, which the Liberals won in a landslide. McDonald was elected for Turtle Mountain, defeating Johnson by 36 votes. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government. The Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1920 provincial election. McDonald faced a serious challenge in Turtle Mountain from new Conservative leader Richard G. Willis, but retained his seat by sixteen votes (1,022 to 1,006). He did not seek re-election in 1922. He was mayor of Boissevain from 1924 to 1926 and served on the town council from 1929 to 1935. McDonald returned to political life in the 1935 federal election, winning the rural Manitoba riding of Souris as a Liberal-Progressive by only three votes (3,504 to 3,501). Ironically, he won this election by defeating incumbent Conservative Errick French Willis, the son of Richard G. Willis. Although he was not formally a member of the Liberal Party of Canada caucus, McDonald served as a backbench supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberal government for the next five years. He was defeated in the 1940 campaign in which he ran as a straight Liberal, losing to \\"National Government\\" candidate J. Arthur Ross by 130 votes. He did not seek a further return to politics after this time. McDonald died at home in Boissevain at the age of 74.

Duple CoachbuildersCompanies House extract company no 252237 Burlingham Limited formerly Duple Limited formerly Duple Coach Builders Limited was a coach and bus bodybuilder in England from 1919 until 1989. History Duple Bodies & Motors was formed in 1919 by Herbert White in Hornsey, London. Before World War I, he had briefly built cars under the Bifort name in Fareham, Hampshire. =Early days= 1933 Dennis Dart / Duple 1937 Bedford WTB / Duple Preserved 1944 Bedford OWB with replica Duple utility body.

The first vehicle of this type was called the Bifort. Subsequently, former military Ford Model Ts were fitted with the newly designed dual-purpose bodywork. The bodies looked like a small touring car, but could be transformed into a van by removing the decking at the rear of the car and fitting a van top. This type of vehicle had enormous appeal to the owners of small businesses, who were able to obtain a working vehicle and private car for little extra, and soon bodywork of this type was being produced in substantial numbers. The 'convertible' body, as it was known internally, was built on Morris Cowley and Oxford chassis as well as the Ford T; as well as the standard van top there was a pick-up and even a version with raising sides and slide-out display shelves for use in markets, production ceasing around the end of the 1920s although Duple continued to repair and service examples for many years afterward. In 1926 a new factory was opened in Hendon to meet growing demand. Coachwork had been built on occasions since the inception of the company, including a six-wheeled Lancia-Barton Charabanc. but in 1928 it was decided to make an effort to increase output of this body type substantially. As a result, the order book began to grow and within ten years the number of people employed had risen to around 800. In 1928, Walter Ernest Brown, a former partner in the Strachan & Brown bodybuilding business, joined the firm, and he had a major influence on the company's future expansion. Major clients of this period included the Great Western Railway, who ordered a number of bodies for its expanding bus fleet, and Elliott Brothers' Royal Blue fleet. =1930s= By 1930, the total number of coach and bus bodies produced was 250, establishing Duple as an emerging bodybuilder of some stature, whose distinctive design features were able to influence national trends. The depression of the 1930s coupled with the introduction of the 1930 Road Traffic Act brought about changes in the bodybuilding sector, which led to a stabilising of the transport industry, established operators feeling secure now that the threat of unregulated competition had been removed by the licensing system. Accordingly, there was a trend towards vehicles with higher standards of finish and more comfortable interiors. In 1930, Duple received the largest single order to date, for 50 bodies to be fitted to the AEC Regal chassis for Green Line Coaches, the newly established express service arm of the London General Omnibus Company. In August 1931, two Bedford passenger chassis (the 14-seat WHB and 20-seat WLB) were announced. Duple had built early bodies on the WLB chassis for the Vauxhall Motors (the parent company of Bedford), and was listed in publicity material as one of the four bodybuilders recommended for the WLB chassis. As demand for the type rose, Duple's ability to produce in quantity set them apart from their competitors, and soon Duple- bodied Bedford WLBs were in service around the country. The association with Bedford was to last over 50 years. In 1932, Duple acquired the business of London Lorries who, despite the name, were heavily involved in the manufacture of coach bodies. By the middle of the 1930s, Duple was widely regarded as a coachbuilder, although bus bodies were still produced in quite large numbers. An order was received from Vauxhall Motors for special sports tourer bodies on Vauxhall 14 hp light six chassis and a stand was taken at the 1933 London Motor Show to display them. They were advertised by Vauxhall up to 1935 and may have been Duple's last car bodies made in quantity, although they also bodied Canadian-assembled Buick 8-50 cars for General Motors in the UK. Also built in the 1930s was a special coup√© on an Alvis speed 20 model for Lloyd Thompson of the Holdsworth Moquette company, a major supplier to Duple and many other coachbuilders. Export business had been developed early, based mainly on the travels of the Duple directors, including W. E. Brown, who had already been to the United States and Canada and now embarked on a Mediterranean tour, taking in Greece, Syria and Egypt. Export orders were also received in quantity from East Africa and Argentina, and closer to home in Europe. This in part helped to compensate for the reduced demand for UK bodywork, which tended to be seasonal. By 1934, the original site had become inadequate and 3¬Ω acres of adjoining land were purchased for expansion. Although car body production was coming to an end, major contracts for the GPO were obtained during the 1930s, for telephone repair vans in the main, on either Morris Minor or larger Morris Commercial Chassis, although two specials were BLB444 of 1934 the blue streamlined van designed to publicise the air mail service, which was modelled as a Dinky Toy. and GPO1 which was a Morris Commercial Leader tractive unit coupled to a Brockhouse semi-trailer upon which Duple built a travelling post office for use at agricultural shows, race meetings and other major public events. The late 1930s saw the era of the classic coach design, with operators becoming increasingly conscious of the appearance of their coaches. Many coach bodies were of individual design, but readily identifiable as Duple. The introduction of sloping pillars, curving roof- and waist-lines along with shaped mouldings on the side panels all contributed to a new 'aerodynamic' style that was increasing in popularity. Although coachwork continued to be Duple's main product, single-deck bus bodies formed a good part of the production from the mid-1930s, with one customer, Barton Transport, placing a bulk order for such bodies to be delivered over an extended period. In 1936, Duple introduced the Vista design of bodywork, primarily for the Bedford WTB chassis. It had curved roof- and waist-lines, and featured a sliding roof as standard. In 1937 a revised design of the Vista, the Vista II, was introduced together with a new design - the Hendonian. Both of these remained in production until the end of the decade. In 1939, Bedford introduced a new range of goods models, which included the 'O', with characteristic 'bullnose' grille. The passenger version was named the 'OB' and Duple modified the Hendonian body to fit the chassis, which at 14 ft 6 in, was longer than the WTB. With the advent of World War II, Bedford production was turned over to the war effort, with only 73 OB chassis produced, and it was not until after cessation of hostilities that the Bedford OB with Duple Vista bodywork was to become a familiar sight on British roads. =Wartime= During World War II, as a member of the London Aircraft Production Group, Duple built fuselages for the Halifax bomber, along with a variety of military products. Duple also built double-deck highbridge and lowbridge buses to utility specifications, and the only new single-deck vehicle to be produced from 1942 to 1945, the Bedford OWB. =Postwar expansion= In 1946 the name of the business was changed to Duple Motor Bodies Limited. The first postwar production model to appear was the Duple Vista body on the Bedford OB chassis. The standard seating capacity soon became 29, although models with different capacities were still available. The Vista coachwork remained Duple's standard OB body until production of the OB chassis ceased in the early 1950s. Deliveries of Duple bodywork on full-sized chassis (such as the AEC Regal) began in May 1946, and were known as the A-type, although its curved lines had their origin in the prewar period, so it was not strictly a new design. Before long the order book was filled for several years ahead. Postwar rebodying became common practice as new chassis were initially hard to obtain and Duple built many A-type bodies on different chassis that helped to make it, with its distinctive side 'flash', a familiar sight in postwar Britain. Alternative styles were available, all with alphabetic codes, such as the B-type and C-types, which differed in detail only and were regarded as 'dual-purpose' bodies, whilst the D-type was Duple's own design of bus body. After the war, there was a move towards metal-framed bodies, partly because of their greater durability and partly because of a shortage of timber for traditional bodywork. Duple designed a metal-framed body (the Almet) for export models on the OB chassis, as well as producing a body design for the new SB chassis, then under development. By 1948, Duple had developed a metal-framed double-deck body, examples of which were delivered to the Red & White group and Scottish Motor Traction. =1950s= In 1950, a range of full-fronted coach bodies named the 'Ambassador' was produced, but with the maximum permitted length for coaches increased to 30 ft and the maximum width to 8 ft, a series of new designs was prepared. Many were given names, such as the Roadmaster and Vega, all intended for use on specific chassis. The Roadmaster particularly was unlike anything Duple had previously produced, with its high, straight waistline and small windows. It earned the nickname 'Iron Duke' and was intended for underfloor engined chassis, hence the higher waistline. The Vega was intended for the new production model of the Bedford SB, and the bodywork featured a gently curving waistline typical of Duple. The 1950s brought a difficult time for the bodybuilding industry: the end of the increased postwar demand led to a rapid decline in orders, and competition for the remaining ones became intense. Many of Duple's former customers were by then in the Tilling Group, which standardised on Bristol chassis and Eastern Coach Works bodywork. Disputes among union labour resulted in a 36-week strike that was catastrophic for Duple. It began to lose significant amounts of business to other companies and a move out of London was considered. In 1952, Duple acquired Nudd Brothers & Lockyer Limited, based in Kegworth. The newly acquired firm was used to produce metal-framed bodies in the Duple standard range. Further premises were acquired in Loughborough in 1955, and in 1956 the Kegworth and Loughborough factories were renamed Duple Motor Bodies (Midland) Limited. In 1958, the business of Willowbrook Limited, of Loughborough, was acquired, although the business continued to operate under its own name for some time. Throughout that period, Duple continued to produce new body designs: the Elizabethan, for underfloor-engined chassis, was introduced in 1953; the Britannia, based on the Elizabethan but with vertical pillars, was introduced in 1955, and the Loughborough-built Donington, for dual-purpose use, was added to the range in 1956. The designs for Bedford chassis had continued to be produced, now known as Super Vista (modified C series goods chassis) and Super Vega (SB). =Sixties Moves= The business of H. V. Burlingham, of Blackpool, best known for the 'Seagull' body of the 1950s, was taken over in August 1960, adding a northern arm to Duple's production. The Burlingham name was retained until 1962, when it was changed to Duple Motor Bodies (Northern) Limited. Towards the end of 1961 Bedford introduced the VAS chassis and Duple produced a completely new design - the Bella Vista - for it. That year the maximum permitted length for coaches was increased to 36 ft and the maximum width to 8 ft 2¬Ω ins, and Duple (Northern) designed and produced the Continental, with seats for up to 51 passengers. At the same time the Bedford Super Vega was replaced by the Bella Vega, using similar styling to the Bella Vista, and when Bedford announced the six-wheeled VAL in 1962, Duple introduced the Vega Major. For 1964, Duple introduced the Commander, initially built at Hendon but switched to Blackpool later, and in 1966 the Viceroy range replaced the Bella series on most Bedford or Ford chassis. From 1968 Duple coach production was concentrated at Blackpool, and the company was renamed Duple Coachbuilders Limited. The Hendon factory finally closed in 1970. The Willowbrook subsidiary continued in business under its own name until it was sold in 1971. =Dominant 1970s= At the 1972 Commercial Motor Show, Duple introduced a new range of bodies called the Dominant, which were similar in appearance to the Plaxton Panorama Elite, already in production since 1968. The Plaxton Supreme range was introduced in 1974, and in response Duple introduced the Dominant II in 1976 with a restyled front and rear end by Michelotti of Turin. The style was cleaner than earlier models with rectangular headlamps in an integrated grille panel and a much deeper windscreen and driver's window. The Dominant and Supreme body styles were the ubiquitous British coach of the period, with very little competition other than small numbers from Willowbrook. The thought of importing coach bodies from abroad was only just being considered towards the end of the decade. =1980s= The Transport Act 1980 saw the introduction of deregulation of coach services over 30 miles in length. A growing trend towards heavier-duty chassis that had been found more reliable for the high mileage and fast speeds of the motorway, caused the market for light coach chassis from Bedford and Ford to collapse in 1981. Duple's output fell from 1,000 bodies in 1976, to 800 in 1980 and to just over 500 in 1981, which resulted in a reduction in the workforce. In 1980, the Dominant range was extended with the Dominant III and IV, with similar front ends to the Dominant II, but with reduced brightwork and bumpers. The Dominant III had high-set forward-angled trapezoid windows with thick pillars. Features of all four versions could be mixed and matched. In 1981, the Goldliner was introduced. This was similar to the Dominant, but with a higher floor to allow increased luggage accommodation and improved passenger sightseeing. The initial Goldliner styling featured a stepped roof behind the entrance door and was available in Goldliner II, III and IV designations, similar to the those of the Dominant. In 1982, the Super Goldliner was introduced for a fleet of twelve rear-engined Dennis Falcon V coaches developed in conjunction with Dennis and the National Bus Company for high-speed Rapide service. The project was conceived and developed in a very short time, allowing inadequate development, and the resultant vehicles developed a reputation for poor reliability. The Super Goldliner styling, including a continuous flat roof in place of the stepped roof, was mixed and matched on subsequent Goldliner vehicles. Imports of foreign makes, such as Neoplan, Bova, Van Hool and Jonckheere, began to make inroads into the UK market. To compete with them, two new body designs, the Laser and the Caribbean, were introduced in 1982. The Laser was a normal-floor body that resembled the Dominant, but with a rounder front and body-coloured front grille. The Caribbean was a high-floor design with a very square appearance. The Calypso was added in 1983 and was a low-floor version of the Caribbean on a Bova underframe. These new designs did little to halt the slide in production and in 1983, Duple output was just 340 bodies. In June 1983, Duple was sold to the Hestair Group, which had already acquired the long established business of Dennis Brothers of Guildford. Duple was renamed Hestair Duple and the Laser and Caribbean were given a facelift to try to improve their popularity. In 1985, a new coach model, known as the 300-series, was introduced. A bus version of the 300 was introduced in 1987, replacing the successful Dominant bus that had continued in production after the coach version had been replaced. A new integral coach of exciting design, with Dennis running units, was added soon after. Known as the Duple 425 (its coefficient of drag), it was greeted with enthusiasm, but the close tie-in with Dennis as chassis maker made dealers of other chassis manufacturers reluctant to use Duple coachwork. The business continued to struggle, but the deregulation of bus services, in 1986, caused uncertainty amongst bus operators and, as a result, little investment in new vehicles was made. By 1988, Duple's output was just 250 bodies. However, at the October 1988 Motor Show, Dennis introduced the Dennis Dart, a midibus chassis that would go on to be one of Britain's most successful buses. Duple displayed a bus body for the chassis, the Dartline, that was based on the 300-series but with a distinctive front design, featuring a stepped windscreen and curved lower panel. In November 1988, Hestair announced that they were selling the Dennis and Duple businesses to a management buyout team, operating under the name Trinity Holdings. The company was renamed Duple International. With declining coach sales, attempts were made to increase the sale of the bus bodywork, including plans for a design for the Scania N113. However, in July 1989, the decision was made to close down the Duple operation. The jigs for the Duple 300-series and the Duple 425 integral were sold to domestic rival Plaxton. Plaxton also bought Duple Services Ltd., the spares and repair business. The Duple body designs for the Dartline were sold to Carlyle Works of Birmingham. Thus ended 70 years of Duple Motor Bodies Limited.

Biography =Early life= Rogers was born in Ocilla, Georgia, on June 4, 1921. He attended the University of Florida, where he was President of Florida Blue Key and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1942. After graduating he joined the U.S. Army, serving in World War II from 1942 to 1946 during which he rose to the rank of Major and received a Bronze Star Medal. Rogers attended The George Washington University Law School but did not graduate there, receiving his law degree instead at the University of Florida College of Law in 1948. Rogers worked as a lawyer in private practice and was a member of the board of directors for Merck & Co. and Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York. =Political career= He was elected as a Democrat to the 84th Congress in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father, Dwight L. Rogers. Rogers served for and was reelected to the eleven succeeding congresses, for 24 years from January 4, 1955, to January 3, 1979. He chose not to run for reelection to the 96th Congress. While a member of the House, Rogers served as chair of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment from 1971 to 1979. Nicknamed \\"Mr. Health,\\" he was a key representative behind the adoption of the National Cancer Act of 1971, the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the Health Maintenance Organization Act, the Emergency Medical Service Act, the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977 and the Clean Air Act of 1970. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. Rogers voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, but voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Rogers was a resident of West Palm Beach, Florida and a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Hogan & Hartson. He was also active in the National Osteoporosis Foundation, Friends of the National Library of Medicine, and the National Leadership Coalition on Health Care (now the National Coalition on Health Care).

The first settlers =Aboriginals= For thousands of years before European settlement the Bunurong people dwelled in the green, lush land between Mordialloc on the eastern shore of Port Phillip, inland to Nunawading. When camped in Mulgrave, the Bunurong lived off emus and kangaroos which were abundant in the area. Their hunting grounds extended up to the Yarra River to the north-west, the Dandenong Ranges to the east and the hills down to Western Port and Port Phillip to the south and south-west. The most famous Bunurong was the elder Derrimut, to whom the first colonists constructed a monument in the Melbourne Cemetery. By the 1840s and 1850s, reduction of their hunting grounds, draining of the swamps and introduction of European diseases such as smallpox and measles effectively ended their ability to maintain a traditional lifestyle. =Thomas Napier and Alexander Scott= Thomas Napier was a Scottish builder who arrived in Tasmania (then called Van Diemen's Land) in the early 1830s, and then proceeded to the Port Phillip District (Melbourne) where he bought up property at present day Collins Street. He then built several residences, but soon turned to squatting. In 1839, Napier settled on the banks of the Dandenong Creek and built his homestead in Jells Park. He was the first European settler in the Mulgrave Parish. In 1841, Thomas Napier sold his property to Alexander Scott, who then named the run Bushy Park Run because of the native fauna. When Scott died, his wife Madeline continued to run Bushy Park and, with the help (and partnership) of brothers Francis and John Drew, managed it until 1846. Meanwhile, Thomas Napier had returned to the Port Phillip District and became associated with Essendon and Fitzroy are named after him. Bushy Park Run survives more or less as the Bushy Park Wetlands. =Reverend James Clow= In August 1838, Rev James Clow bought Corhanwarrabul Run, land 36 miles (58 km) from Dandenong Creek in the vicinity of Wellington Road. He had associated with the local Aboriginals and had found them to be friendly and talented musically and physically. His homestead was named Tirhatuan and was located on the north side of Wellington Road. =The Scotchmans Creek Run= The area of present-day Mount Waverley once was full of creeks and bushland. One main creek that flowed into the Yarra River was Scotchmans Creek. In January 1840, John McMillan leased 13 km¬≤ of land focussed around Scotchmans Creek. The boundaries of the run extended from Princes Highway (Dandenong Road) south-east to Wellington Road, north along Springvale Road and east along Waverley Road. McMillan ran a herd of about 400 cattle, grew vegetables and planted European trees. At the end of 1846, McMillan transferred the rights to the run to John McKean. Some time later, it passed into the hands of Van Amstel, after whom Van Amstel Park in Mount Waverley is named. =The Township of Waverley= In 1852, Dr James Silverman retired to New Holland to seek his fortune as a pioneer. Buying for ¬£760 on the corner of High Street Road and Stephensons Road, he surveyed and subdivided the land, naming it the Township of Waverley. This name was later used for the naming of suburbs and then for a municipality. =Other pioneer settlers= The area of Mulgrave/Waverley was settled by successful pioneers. The area specialised in fruits. In 1849, Joseph Jells purchased land on present day Jells Road. With a frontage on Dandenong Creek, Jells Park was named after him. Next door John Wheeler lived, having settled on July 28, 1854. Wheeler's claim was in area and was located south of Jells‚Äô run. The area is now known as Wheelers Hill and includes land further south to the hills. Another settler in this area was Thomas Armstrong who settled further south of Wheelers. Armstrong's property was separated by Bennett's property and bordered Wellington Rd. The most famous settler was pioneer Sir Redmond Barry. Redmond was a judge who passed sentences on several bushrangers including Ned Kelly. Redmond owned two large properties in Monash. Syndal was situated near present-day Syndal Station and occupied . St Johnswood was situated further north-west and occupied . Other settlers included John Drummie, Patrick Brennan, Hugh and Mary Rourke, John Gallaghers and Bennetts. From parish to city Southern NSW (now State of Victoria) had settlements at Port Phillip in the centre, Portland to the west and Gippsland to the east. Settlers first settled at Port Phillip District (Melbourne) and had sailed along the east coast and settled along the shore lines. A shipping service between Gippsland and Melbourne was created, but it soon became obvious that a road service was required to link the settlements over land. In 1851, the State of Victoria was established and the construction of a road linking St Kilda to Dandenong was approved - Princes Highway/Dandenong Rd. On completion, the route passed through the south-west corner of the Parish of Oakleigh/Mulgrave where the village of Oakleigh was located. Shortly following, a telegraph line was built and in 1865, Cobb and Co coaches began operating as a transportation service. These coaches made a one-stop journey back and forth, the stop at Oakleigh Village. On 19 January 1857, the Parish of Mulgrave and Oakleigh were gazetted as the Road District of Mulgrave and Oakleigh respectively. These two road districts later merged as the Shire of Oakleigh on 1 December 1871. On 13 March 1891, the Shire of Oakleigh split when the south and centre ridings formed the Borough of Oakleigh, renaming the rest as the Shire of Mulgrave. In 1949 and again in 1959, land was ‚Äòtransferred‚Äô from Mulgrave to Oakleigh. The size of the Shire of Mulgrave now was reduced to . The Shire of Mulgrave and Borough of Oakleigh progressed through World War One, the Great Depression and World War Two. New Shire offices were later opened at Notting Hill. In April 1961, the Shire of Mulgrave was gazetted as the City of Waverley, the name taken from Dr James Silverman's property- Township of Waverley. At the same time, the Borough of Oakleigh formed the City of Oakleigh. Finally, on 15 December 1994, the City of Waverley and most of the City of Oakleigh merged back as The City Of Monash.

The double rifle, also known as the double-barrelled rifle, is a rifle with two barrels mounted parallel to each other. Synonymous with big game hunting in Africa and India, the double rifle is a purely sporting weapon with no military heritage. Design The double rifle is usually handcrafted and is considered by many to be the pinnacle of sporting rifle design. It is not designed for long-range accuracy but instead for the security of an immediate second shot. =Action= As with double-barrelled shotguns, modern double rifles are all made with either sidelock or boxlock actions, although occasionally old hammer rifles can be found. The majority of double rifles have been built on the boxlock actions as it is a simple design with few parts that can fail and consequently it has an outstanding reputation for reliability. The sidelock action, with its lockwork operating behind the main action body, has exceptional inherent strength and as a result could be built on slimmer action sizes in proportion to the calibre, although it is far more labour intensive to manufacture and so more expensive. Most double rifles manufactured today, especially those designed for dangerous game, are manufactured with selective ejectors which greatly speeds reloading. However many old hunters preferred non-ejector rifles, feeling that with practice they could reload just as quickly, these rifles can still be found and usually attract a slightly lower price. =Barrels= Symbol for Double rifle Double rifles can come in two barrel configurations, over and under designs (usually abbreviated as O/U) where the two barrels are mounted vertically one on top of the other, or side by side (usually abbreviated as SxS) where the two barrels are mounted horizontally next to each other. For dangerous game hunting, side by side rifles are usually preferred. This is for a number of reasons but predominantly because the barrels of an over and under gun must be pivoted much farther down to clear the lower barrel for reloading. During manufacture the barrels of double rifles require \\"regulation\\" to ensure the bullet paths from both barrels are aimed at a common point of aim. This can be done to ensure either the bullets 1) parallel each other closely at all practical ranges, or 2) converge at a given range, beyond which they begin to diverge. Because of the need to regulate a rifle to a specific loading of its chambered cartridge, once regulated a double rifle cannot satisfactorily shoot bullets of different weights or velocities, as it usually affects the accuracy. The process of regulating a double rifle‚Äôs barrels is complex and can be time consuming, significantly adding to the cost of the rifle. =Sights= Whilst many modern double rifles are fitted with telescopic sights, the need for fast target acquisition in the face of dangerous game led to the development of the \\"Express\\" iron sights. Express sights feature a very wide and shallow rear V, usually with a white line marking the bottom of the V. The purpose of express sights is to allow for well aimed shots over moderate ranges when there was time for careful sighting, and to allow the rifle to be pointed like a shotgun to stop the charge of a dangerous animal at very short range when there is little time for aiming. =Calibres= Double rifles have been produced in all calibres from to . Traditional British double rifle calibres include the Rook rifle, Black Powder Express and rimmed Nitro Express families of cartridges and many of these can still be obtained today. European makers tend to chamber their double rifles in metric rimmed calibres developed by European firms, although British and American cartridges are offered. History The development of the double rifle has always followed the development of the double-barrelled shotgun, the two are generally very similar but the stresses of firing a solid projectile are far greater than shot. The first double- barrelled muskets were created in the 1830s when deer stalking became popular in Scotland. Previously single barrelled weapons had been used but, recognising the need for a rapid second shot to dispatch a wounded animal, double-barrelled muskets were built along the same format as double-barrelled shotguns already in common use. These first double-barrelled weapons were black powder, smoothbore muzzleloaders built with either flintlock or percussion cap ignition systems. Whilst true rifling dates from the mid 16th century, the invention of the express rifle by James Purdey \\"the Younger\\" in 1856 allowed for far greater muzzle velocities to be achieved through a rifled longarm, significantly improving the trajectory and as such greatly improving the range of these rifles. These express rifles had two deep opposing grooves which were wide and deep enough to prevent the lead bullets from stripping the rifling if fired at high velocities, a significant problem previously. These muzzle loading rifles came in a large variety of calibres, the most common calibres for medium thin skinned plains and deer sized game were , , , and 12 bore (18.5 mm or .729 in). For larger thick skinned type game 10 bore (19.7 mm or .775 in), 8 bore (21.2 mm or .835 in) and 4 bore (26.7 mm or 1.05 in) were used, the last being a specialist elephant hunting calibre. Whilst most of these calibres could be purchased with rifling, the giant 4 bore and the less common 6 bore were rarely rifled, as the increased friction from the rifling caused excessive recoil. Various experimental breech loaders had been in existence since the 16th century, however developments such as the Ferguson rifle in the 1770s and early pinfire cartridges in the 1830s had little impact on sporting rifles due to their experimental nature, expense and the extraordinary strength and reliability of the percussion muzzleloader. In 1858, Westley Richards patented the break open, top leaver breech loading action, whilst a useful development these early break open designs had a great deal of elasticity in the action and upon firing they sprung open slightly, a problem that gradually worsened with repeated firing and with more powerful cartridges. Many gunmakers tried various methods to rectify this problem, all to little avail until Westley Richards invented the \\"Dolls head\\" lock in 1862 which greatly improved rigidity, this was followed by James Purdey's under- locking mechanism in 1863 and W.W. Greener's \\"Wedge fast\\" system in 1873, finally the basic break open action known to this day had the strength required to meet the stresses of large-bore projectiles. By 1914, triple, quadruple and even quintuple locking designs could be found in various proprietary actions. In 1861 the centrefire rifle cartridge was invented, and quickly a large number of blackpowder centrefire cartridges were developed in the same calibres as their muzzle loading forebears, including the .450/400 Black Powder Express, the extremely popular .450 Black Powder Express, the .500 Black Powder Express and the .577 Black Powder Express, all with various case lengths. The first brass 10 bore, 8 bore and 4 bore cartridges were not developed until 1870, their arrival spelling the end of the muzzle loading era. Until this time all double rifles had external hammers whose fall struck the mechanism which fired the cartridge, however attempts to remove them were well under way. The first \\"hammerless\\" action of significance was invented by Thomas Murcott in 1871, known as \\"The Mousetrap\\", it was a complex design but it sold in significant numbers. In 1875, Westley Richards employees William Anson and John Deeley patented the \\"Anson & Deeley\\" hammerless boxlock action, and in 1878 the Birmingham gunmakers W&C; Scott & Son invented the basic sidelock action which was so successful it was immediately adopted by Holland & Holland. By 1900 the boxlock and sidelock hammerless actions had largely superseded the hammer rifles and, with the addition of ejectors and assisted opening, the basic design of the double rifle has changed little to this day. Incidentally, it was Westley Richards who invented the first reliable safety catch for doubles, ejectors, the single selective trigger and the special extractors that enabled rimless cartridges to be used in double rifles, all features found in modern double rifles. In 1898, John Rigby & Company loaded the .450 Black Powder Express with smokeless cordite creating the .450 Nitro Express, the first Nitro Express cartridge, this was to have a profound impact on sporting cartridge development and the double rifle was to become synonymous with the Nitro Express cartridges. Now in its final form and chambering modern Nitro Express cartridges, the British double rifle entered its golden age at the turn of 20th century and it was to last for the next three decades, with the birth of the White hunter and professional hunting safari industry in East Africa. After the Second World War, a combination of increased labour costs and a shrinking British Empire saw an end to the demand for handcrafted sporting rifles and the double rifle was largely supplanted by the bolt action rifle. It was not until the 1980s and the emergence of the big game hunting industry in Southern Africa that production of double rifles resumed at a steady rate, driven largely by demand from American sportsmen. Use For African hunting the Nitro Express double rifle remains extremely popular, although unaffordable for the majority of hunters. In Europe, the double rifle remains reasonably popular in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Spain and Eastern Europe for hunting wild boar, bear, stag and moose.

Bergey (August 26, 1901 ‚Äì September 30, 1952) was an American artist and illustrator who painted cover art for thousands of pulp fiction magazines and paperback books. One of the most prolific pulp fiction artists of the 20th century, Bergey is recognized for creating the iconic cover of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for Popular Library at the height of his career in 1948. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (published as Popular Library #221). Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, circa 1948. Bergey was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to A. Frank and Ella Kulp Bergey. He attended Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1921 to 1926, finishing formal Academy studies in the spring of 1926. He initially went to work in the art departments of Philadelphia newspapers including Public Ledger, and he drew the comic strip Deb Days in 1927. Early in his career, Bergey contributed many covers to the pulp magazines of publisher Fiction House. By the mid-1930s, Bergey made a home and studio in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and he married in 1935. Pulp magazines Throughout the 1930s, Bergey worked freelance for a number of publishing houses. His eye-catching paintings were predominantly featured as covers on a wide array of pulp magazines, including romance (Thrilling Love, Popular Love, Love Romances) as well as detective, adventure, aviation, and Westerns. Bergey illustrated mainstream publications, such as The Saturday Evening Post, during this time. He illustrated covers for fitness magazines. Along with pin-up painting peers such as Enoch Bolles and H.J. Ward, Earle K. Bergey was one of the first prominent American pin-up artists, contributing hundreds of covers to influential magazines including Gay Book Magazine, Pep Stories, and Snappy. During the 1940s, Bergey continued to paint covers for romance, sports, and detective pulp magazines, and he began working on a number of science fiction magazines, including Standard Publications' Strange Stories, Startling Stories, and Captain Future, and later for Fantastic Story Magazine. Bergey's fine art training and salient gift for depicting anatomy made him a go-to artist across a diversity of genres that required scenes with dramatic movement, from photo-realistic sports portraits of famous athletes including Mickey Cochrane, Lou Gehrig, and Jim Thorpe to his signature Bergey Girls that appeared on risque pulps throughout the Depression and in science fiction scenarios from World War II. The artist's illustrations of scantily-clad women surviving in outer space served as an inspiration for Princess Leia's slave-girl outfit in Return of the Jedi, even its color and cut, and Madonna's conical brass brassiere. Bergey's science fiction covers, sometimes described as \\"Bim, BEM, Bum,\\" usually featured a woman being menaced by a Bug-Eyed Monster, alien, or robot, with an heroic male astronaut coming to her assistance. Bikini-tops worn by Bergey girls often resembled coppery metal, giving rise to the phrase \\"the girl in the brass bra,\\" used in reference to this sort of art. Visionaries in TV and film have been influenced by Bergey's work; Gene Roddenberry, for example, provided his production designer for Star Trek with examples of Bergey's futuristic pulp covers.Clark, Mark (2012). Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Applause: Milwaukee, WI. Paperbacks In 1948, Bergey made the transition to the rapidly expanding paperback book industry along with skilled pulp artists like Rudolph Belarski, whose work is often confused with Bergey's. While continuing to paint pulp covers until his death, Bergey sold illustrations to at least four (4) leading paperback publishing houses, including Popular Library and Pocket Books. His art graced the covers of dozens of novels and helped to sell millions of volumes. His paperback cover illustrations were as diverse as his work for the pulps. In addition to his work on Anita Loos' famous Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bergey painted cover art for well-known authors from √âmile Zola to the Western master, Zane Grey, whose 1951 Pocket Books edition cover painting for Spirit Of The Border is a Bergey classic. Many of his paperbacks are now cult classics, some featuring hidden self-portraits. Bergey died suddenly and unexpectedly on September 30, 1952 in New Hope, Pennsylvania with family at his side. Cause of death according to his State of Pennsylvania death certificate was acute coronary thrombosis due to coronary artery disease.

Harlequin syndrome is considered an injury to the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS controls some of the body's natural processes such as sweating, skin flushing and pupil response to stimuli. Such individuals with this syndrome have an absence of sweat skin flushing unilaterally; usually on the one side of the face, arms and chest. It is an autonomic disorder that may occur at any age. Harlequin syndrome affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Symptoms associated with Harlequin syndrome are more likely to appear when a person has been in the following conditions: exercising, warm environment and intense emotional situation. Since one side of the body sweats and flushes appropriately to the condition, the other side of the body will have an absence of such symptoms. This syndrome has also been called the \\"Harlequin sign\\" and thought to be one of the spectrum of diseases that may cause Harlequin syndrome. It can also be the outcome of a one sided endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) or endoscopic sympathetic blockade (ESB) surgery. Harlequin syndrome can also be seen as a complication of VA (veno-arterial) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This involves differential hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) of the upper body in comparison to the lower body. Signs and symptoms The \\"Harlequin sign\\" is unilateral flushing and sweating of the face, neck, and upper chest usually after exposure to heat or strenuous exertion.National Institutes of Health: Office of Rare Diseases Research. (2009) \\"Harlequin syndrome.\\" Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD). http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/8610/QnA/22289/Harlequin_syndrome.aspx. December 9, 2011. Horner syndrome, another problem associated with the sympathetic nervous system, is often seen in conjunction with harlequin syndrome. Since Harlequin syndrome is associated with a dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, main symptoms of this dysfunction are in the following: Absence of sweat(anhidrosis) and flushing on one side of the face, neck, or upper thoracic area. In addition, other symptoms include cluster headaches, tearing of the eyes, nasal discharge, abnormal contraction of the pupils, weakness in neck muscles, and drooping of one side of the upper eyelid.  Causes  One possible cause of Harlequin syndrome is a lesion to the preganglionic or postganglionic cervical sympathetic fibers and parasympathetic neurons of the ciliary ganglion. It is also believed that torsion (twisting) of the thoracic spine can cause blockage of the anterior radicular artery leading to Harlequin syndrome.Lance, J. W.; Drummond, P. D.; Gandevia, S. C.; Morris, J. G. L. (1988) \\"Harlequin syndrome: the sudden onset of unilateral flushing and sweating.\\" Journal of Nerology, Nerosurgery, and Psychiatry (51): 635-642. The sympathetic deficit on the denervated side causes the flushing of the opposite side to appear more pronounced. It is unclear whether or not the response of the undamaged side was normal or excessive, but it is believed that it could be a result of the body attempting to compensate for the damaged side and maintain homeostasis. Since the cause and mechanism of Harlequin syndrome is still unknown, there is no way to prevent this syndrome.  Mechanism  Although the exact mechanism for Harlequin syndrome is still unclear, understanding what is affected with this syndrome is important. Majority of cases are thought to occur when nerve bundles in the head and neck are injured. Such bundles are able to send an action potential from the autonomic nervous system to the rest of the body. However, action potentials in this system are not being received by the second or third thoracic vertebrae which innervates the face, neck, and upper chest. Damage or lesions near T2 or T3 could be between the stellate ganglion and superior cervical ganglion. This is where we would observe absence of sweat and skin flushing on one side of the face, neck, and upper chest.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of Harlequin syndrome is made when the individual has consistent signs and symptoms of the condition, therefore, it is made by clinical observation. In addition, a neurologist or primary care physician may require an MRI test to rule out similar disorders such as Horner's syndrome, Adie's syndrome, and Ross' syndrome. In an MRI, a radiologist may observe areas near brain or spinal cord for lesions, or any damage to the nerve endings. It is also important that the clinician rules out traumatic causes by performing autonomic function tests. Such tests includes the following: tilt table test, orthostatic blood pressure measurement, head-up test, valsalva maneuver, thermoregulatory sweat test, tendon reflex test, and electrocardiography (ECG). CT scan of the heart and lungs may also be performed to rule out a structural underlying lesion. The medical history of the individual should be carefully noted. Treatment and prognosis Harlequin syndrome is not debilitating so treatment is not normally necessary. In cases where the individual may feel socially embarrassed, contralateral sympathectomy may be considered, although compensatory flushing and sweating of other parts of the body may occur. In contralateral sympathectomy, the nerve bundles that cause the flushing in the face are interrupted. This procedure causes both sides of the face to no longer flush or sweat. Since symptoms of Harlequin syndrome do not typically impair a person‚Äôs daily life, this treatment is only recommended if a person is very uncomfortable with the flushing and sweating associated with the syndrome. Research  In August 2016, researchers at the Instituto de Assist√™ncia dos Servidores do Estado do Rio de Janeiro used botulinum toxin as a method to block the acetylcholine release from the presynaptic neurons. Although they have seen a reduction in one sided flushing, sweating still occurs. There have been case studies of individuals who have experienced this syndrome after an operation. Two female patients suffering from metastatic cancer, ages 37-years-old and 58-years-old, were scheduled for placement of an intrathecal pump drug delivery system. After the intrathecal pump was placed, certain medications were given to the patients. Once the medications were administered, both patients had one sided facial flushes, closely resembling Harlequin Syndrome. Patients were given neurological exams to confirm that their nerves were still intact. An MRI was performed and showed no significant evidence of bleeding or nerve compression. After close observation for 16 hours, symptoms of the Harlequin syndrome was diminished and both patients did not have another episode. Another case study was based on a 6-year-old male visiting an outpatient setting for one sided flushes during or after physical activity or exposed to heat. Vitals, laboratory tests, and CT scans were normal. Along with the flushes, the right pupil was 1.5 mm in size, while the left pupil was 2.5 mm in size; however, no ptosis, miosis, or enophthalmos was noted. The patient also had an MRI scan to rule out any lesion near the brain or spinal cord. No abnormalities were noted and the patient did not receive any treatments. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic Harlequin syndrome. Although the mechanism is still unclear, the pathophysiology of this condition, close monitoring, and reassurance are vital factors for successful management. Eponym The name for the syndrome is credited to Lance and Drummond who were inspired by resemblance patient‚Äôs half-flushed faces bore to colorful Harlequin masks.

It was filmed and released within four months of the late-1966 Sunset Strip curfew riots. The film stars Frank Alesia, Aldo Ray, Mimsy Farmer, Michael Evans, Anna Strasberg, Laurie Mock, Gene Kirkwood, Tim Rooney, and features musical appearances by The Standells and The Chocolate Watch Band. Earlier that year, Farmer, Mock and Kirkwood appeared in Hot Rods to Hell, where Farmer portrayed the bad girl and Mock a vulnerable virgin. In this film, they switched characters. The film attempts to capture the essence of the period around the Sunset Strip riot, and also adds a subplot that revolves around a young girl's troubled relationship with her divorced parents. Her dosage with LSD by a would-be seducer, the subsequent 'acid trip' she experiences, and her later discovery by a police sergeant as the victim of gang rape, are among the movie's peak moments. The film is now available on DVD through the MGM Limited Edition Collection. Production notes \\"Riot on Sunset Strip\\", a classic song in the genre of garage punk, was written for the film by Tony Valentino and John Fleck of the Standells.

Longo became first well known in the 1980s for his Men in the Cities drawing and print series, which depict sharply dressed men and women writhing in contorted emotion. Early life and education Robert Longo was born in 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Long Island. He had a childhood fascination with mass media: movies, television, magazines, and comic books, which continue to influence his art. Longo began college at the University of North Texas, in the town of Denton, but left before getting a degree. He later studied sculpture under Leonda Finke, who encouraged him to pursue a career in the visual arts. In 1972, Longo received a grant to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy. Upon his return to New York, Longo enrolled at Buffalo State College, where he received a BFA in 1975. While at Buffalo State, he studied under, and was likely influenced by art professor Joseph Piccillo. At this time he was associated with artist Cindy Sherman, who was also studying art at Buffalo State. While in college, Longo and his friends established an avant garde art gallery in their co-op building, the Essex Art Center, which was originally a converted ice factory; the gallery became Hallwalls Contemporary Art Center. Through his gallery efforts, Longo met many local and New York City artists. Longo eventually moved to New York City to join the underground art scene of the 1970s. Artwork Although he studied sculpture, drawing remained Longo's favorite form of self-expression. However, the sculptural influence pervades his drawing technique, as Longo's \\"portraits\\" have a distinctive chiseled line that seems to give the drawings a three-dimensional quality. Longo uses graphite like clay, molding it to create images like the writhing, dancing figures in his seminal Men in the Cities series. For that series, Longo photographed his friends lurching backward, collapsing forward or sprawled on invisible pavement.Grace Glueck (February 11, 1983), Art: Works By Longo On View At 2 Galleries New York Times. After enlarging the pictures through a projector, he and an artist assistant drew them in sizes ranging from three- quarter scale to larger than life-size. In the process, Longo often dramatized poses and always standardized attire into quite formal, black-and-white clothing.Suzanne Muchnic (March 31, 1986), Art Review : Constant Lure Of Longo's 'Men' Los Angeles Times. The idea for this work came, in 1975, from a still image in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film The American Soldier. According to art critic William Wilson of the Los Angeles Times, the pictures recall nothing so much as the final scene in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal.William Wilson (October 1, 1989), Robert Longo: Too Much Too Soon? Los Angeles Times. About four years passed before Longo turned the vision of a man shot in the back into a monumental series of drawings. He produced about 60 Men in the Cities between 1979 and 1982. One drawing from this series was used as the album cover to Glenn Branca's album The Ascension.http://cdn.pitchfork.com/media/909-the-ascension.jpg As a consequence, in his 30s, Longo was among the most widely publicized, exhibited and collected artists of the 1980s along with the likes of Cindy Sherman and David Salle. However, several critics have commented that Longo had lost his way as a visual artist by the mid-'80s.Kristine McKenna (May 21, 1995), It's Just Art on a Big Screen Los Angeles Times. Working on themes of power and authority, Longo produced a series of blackened American flags (\\"Black Flags\\" 1989‚Äì91) as well as oversized hand guns (Bodyhammers 1993‚Äì95). From 1995 to 1996 he worked on his Magellan project, 366 drawings (one per day) that formed an archive of the artist's life and surrounding cultural images. \\"Magellan\\" was followed by 2002's Freud Drawings, which reinterpreted Edmund Engelman's famous documentary images of Sigmund Freud's flat, moments before his flight from the Nazis. In 2002 and 2004 he presented Monsters, Bernini-esque renderings of massive breaking waves and The Sickness of Reason, baroque renderings of atomic bomb blasts. Monsters was included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial. To create works such as Barbara and Ralph, Longo projects photographs of his subjects onto paper and traces the figures in graphite, removing all details of the background. After he records the basic contours, his long-time illustrator, Diane Shea, works on the figure for about a week, filling in the details. Next, Longo goes back into the drawing, using graphite and charcoal to provide \\"all the cosmetic work\\". Longo continues to work on the drawing, making numerous adjustments until it is completed about a week later. In 2013, Longo's artwork was featured in an article in the men's magazine, Man of the World along with an article discussing his life and career. In March 2013, The Lexander Magazine reviewed Longo's 1982-83 diptych entitled Pressure, highlighting it as the \\"penultimate visual anthem of the era,\\" expanding upon Neal Benezra's 1988 analysis of the work as having been \\"the most representative work of art of the 1980s.\\" Exhibitions Longo has had retrospective exhibitions at Hamburger Kunstverein and Deichtorhallen, Menil Collection in Houston, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1989, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 1990, Hartford Athenaeum, The Isetan Museum of Art in Tokyo, and a Survey Exhibition 1980-2009, at Mus√©e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain in Nice France in 2009 and at Museu Colec√ß√£o Berardo in Lisbon, Portugal in 2010. Group exhibitions include Documenta VIII, the Whitney Biennial, and the Venice Biennale.Robert Longo: Surrendering the Absolutes, April 23 ‚Äì May 30, 2009 Metro Pictures, New York. His photorealistic charcoal drawings were featured in the exhibition Proof at the Brooklyn Museum in 2017 alongside works by Goya and Eisenstein. Other projects =Music videos= In the 1980s, Longo directed several music videos, including New Order's Bizarre Love Triangle, Megadeth's Peace Sells and The One I Love by R.E.M. He is responsible for the front covers of Glenn Branca's The Ascension from 1981 and The Replacements' 1985 album Tim, while his work has inspired others such as Circlesquare's music video Dancers. =Film and television= In 1992, Longo directed an episode of Tales from the Crypt entitled This'll Kill Ya. He also directed the Cyberpunk Film and television movie Johnny Mnemonic, starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and a short film named Arena Brains. At the time, Longo was quoted as saying, \\"making a painting is one thing, but making a film kicks your ass.\\" During the late 1980s and early 1990s Longo developed a number of performance art theatre pieces, such as Marble Fog and Killing Angels, collaborating with Stuart Argabright, the guitarist Chuck Hammer and Douglas Sloan. =Music= He was the leader and guitarist of a musical act called Robert Longo's Menthol Wars, which performed punk experimental music in New York rock clubs in the late 1970s. During the same period, he also performed with Rhys Chatham in Chatham's Guitar Trio, producing a series of slowly fading slides entitled Pictures for Music, which was played behind the musicians. His work from the Men in the Cities series is also prominently displayed in the apartment of fictional character Patrick Bateman in the film American Psycho (2000). =Photography= Commissioned by Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta, Longo photographed models Terron Wood and Alla K for the brand's fall/winter 2010 advertisements, evoking memories of the dancing silhouettes of his Men in the Cities series.Sarah Haight (July 2010), Lens Man: Tomas Maier W. Personal life Longo lived with artist Cindy Sherman from 1974 to 1980. He lived with artist Gretchen Bender from 1981 to 1989. Longo married German actress Barbara Sukowa in 1994. They split in 2018. Together they have 3 sons: Hans Longo, Viktor Longo, and Joseph Longo.

Development  The earlier Soyuz 11A511 was the first attempt at creating a standardized R-7 core in place of the numerous variations that had been used up to 1966. Starting that year, the 11A511 Blok I and strap-on boosters were added to the Voskhod (11A57), Vostok-2 (8A92), and Molniya-M (8K78M) vehicles as well as minor R-7 variants flown once or twice for specialized payloads. The uprated 11A511U core was introduced to the R-7 family in 1973, yielding the carrier rocket variant named Soyuz-U, although adoption across the board was not complete until 1977 when the existing stock of 11A511-derived boosters was used up.  Versions  Two versions of Soyuz-U were fitted with an additional upper stage: * Soyuz-U/Ikar with the Ikar third stage, produced by the Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center, TsSKB-Progress. Ikar is used to deliver various payloads with masses of 750 kg to 3920 kg to heights 250 km to 1400 km. The performance of the Ikar upper stage is lower than that of the Fregat upper stage, but it is more precise in maneuvering and it can operate autonomously longer. This version was launched 6 times in 1999, carrying four GlobalStar satellites on each mission. * Soyuz-U/Fregat with the Fregat third stage, developed and produced by Lavochkin Association in Khimki. This version only flew 4 times in 2000; the Fregat upper stage was subsequently flown regularly atop Soyuz-FG and Soyuz-2 boosters. An older variant of Soyuz-U, the Soyuz-U2 launcher, first flown in 1982, had the same hardware as the basic Soyuz-U. Instead of standard RP-1, it used a high energy, synthetic version, Syntin, as the first stage fuel. This variant, mainly used to transport crew and cargo to the Mir space station, last flew in 1995, after production of Syntin ended due to cost reasons. Soyuz-U was the basic platform for the development of the Soyuz-FG variant, which used an all-new first stage and took over crew transport to the ISS in 2002. Since 2013, both Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG are gradually being replaced by the modernized Soyuz-2 launch vehicle.  Human spaceflight  The first use of a Soyuz-U to launch a crewed mission took place 2 December 1974, when the Soyuz 16 crew was launched in preparation for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). Soyuz 19, which as part of the ASTP docked with the last Apollo spacecraft ever flown, was also launched by a Soyuz-U rocket. On 6 July 1976, a Soyuz-U launched Soyuz 21, which took a crew of two to the Salyut 5 space station. Many subsequent space station crews were launched on Soyuz-U launchers. The final crewed mission to utilize the Soyuz-U was Soyuz TM-34, a Soyuz ferry flight to the International Space Station. A spectacular accident occurred on 26 September 1983, when the launcher for the Soyuz T-10a mission was destroyed by fire on the launch pad. The crew was saved by activation of the launch escape system a few seconds before the explosion.  Recent missions  Since the early 2000s, Soyuz-U vehicles have been used by the Russian Federal Space Agency primarily to launch Progress-M robotic cargo spacecraft on resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Although the Soyuz-U is generally very reliable, occasional failures have happened, such as the October 2002 launch of a Foton satellite which crashed near the pad at Plesetsk after the Blok D strap-on booster suffered an engine malfunction. One person on the ground was killed. A Soyuz-U mission failed to launch Progress M-12M to the ISS on 24 August 2011, when the upper stage experienced a problem and broke up over Siberia. It was the first time a Progress spacecraft had failed to reach orbit. Another cargo ship, Progress MS-04, was lost on 1 December 2016 shortly after launch, likely due to a problem with the third stage of the Soyuz-U. In April 2015, Soyuz-U was declared obsolete; its production has been stopped, and the rocket was scheduled for retirement after launching the remaining vehicles with Progress cargo ships. The final flight was Progress MS-05, which launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 22 February 2017, 05:58:33 UTC.

The ship was originally designed as an inter-island shuttle for military and naval cargoes. She was designed to receive cargo from much larger Victory and Liberty ships and then deliver it to U.S. forces on small outlying islands but was actually never used for that purpose due to the end of World War II. In the late-1940s, the M/V Coastal Messenger was operated by both the Standard Fruit & Steamship Company and Grace Line, Inc., primarily along the coasts to northern South America. On a trip to South America she ran aground at La Salina on Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela but was freed after 11 days with extensive, though minor, damage. She was then mothballed with the reserve fleet and transferred to the control of the Department of State in 1952. USCGC Courier WAGR-410 (1952-1964) The United States Coast Guard Cutter Courier was acquired as part of a joint operation between the United States Department of State and the United States Coast Guard to become a mobile transmitting facility for the U.S. Information Agency's \\"Voice of America\\" program. In response to an initiative, code-named Operation Vagabond, that was approved by President Harry S. Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and announced by the Department of State in April, 1951, the operation was designed to provide a ship-borne radio relay station to transmit Voice of America programs behind the Iron Curtain. Such a vessel could move to any areas of trouble quickly, could serve as a temporary relay station as needed, and permit the use of a station where it was impractical to build a shore station. To ease political sensitivities, it was decided that the Coast Guard should operate the vessels, which in the planning stages were to have been a total of six vessels. Excessive costs kept the operation to a single vessel. Commissioned on February 15, 1952 in Hoboken, New Jersey, Courier's call sign was \\"Vagabond-Able\\".Cummings, Richard .

Truman visited the Courier on March 4, 1952, when the ship docked in Washington, D.C. and he used the occasion to broadcast a major policy speech beamed at Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. On April 18, 1952, during the Courier's shakedown cruise to the Panama Canal Zone, using the call sign KU2XAJ, tests were performed at 1700‚Äì2300 on 6110 and 9690 kc. shortwave (35 kW), and 1510 kc. medium wave (150 kW). The broadcasts closed with the playing of the Panamanian National Anthem and the Star Spangled Banner. The Courier initially used a $18,000 35' √ó 69' barrage balloon that held the medium wave antennae aloft. The Courier carried 5 of these balloons, but on more than one occasion the balloon broke free. Eventually it was decided to replace the balloon with a mast-supported wire antenna. The Courier also held the record for longest deployment overseas - from 17 July 1952 to 13 August 1964, she spent no time in United States territorial waters being stationed instead off the island of Rhodes, Greece during that time. Courier was decommissioned on 25 August 1964 upon her return to Yorktown, Virginia and turned over to the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center at Yorktown, Virginia. Placed in \\"out of commission, in Reserve\\" status, beginning July 1, 1965, Courier provided dockside training in merchant marine safety and dangerous cargo handling for the next year. USCGC Courier WTR-410 (1966‚Äì1972) The USCGC Courier WTR-410 was recommissioned into the Coast Guard at Yorktown, Virginia on 30 April 1966. Here the Courier's mission was to serve as a mobile operational training platform with qualified personnel attached and to aid by giving guidance during operational Port Security training at various sites during two week active duty for training periods.

It carries Connecticut Avenue over the Rock Creek gorge, including Rock Creek and the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, connecting the neighborhoods of Woodley Park and Kalorama. It is named after former United States president and Supreme Court Chief Justice William Howard Taft, and sits to the southwest of the Duke Ellington Bridge. Four statues of lions by sculptor Roland Hinton Perry, known as the Perry Lions, are placed in pairs at both ends of the bridge. On July 3, 2003, the Taft Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The Classical Revival bridge was built from 1897 to 1907. It was designed by engineer George S. Morison and architect Edward Pearce Casey. It is an arch bridge with unreinforced concrete arches and a reinforced concrete deck. The total length of the bridge is . It has been called an \\"engineering tour de force\\" and the largest unreinforced concrete structure in the world. In 1931, the bridge was renamed in honor of U.S. President William Howard Taft, who frequently walked the bridge while Chief Justice of the United States. During early planning for the Washington Metro in the 1960s, the Red Line was slated to run across the bridge to connect Dupont Circle and Woodley Park. Instead, the metro was built underground. Perry Lions The bridge is \\"guarded\\" by four large male lions, two on each end of the bridge (each approx. 7 ft. x 6 ft. 6 in. x 13 ft.). Two of the lions rest on all fours with their heads tilted upwards and mouths slightly open while the other pair lie with their eyes closed, apparently sleeping. They were originally designed and sculpted by Roland Hinton Perry in 1906 out of cast concrete (the bridge as a whole is one of the first cast concrete bridges in the country) and were installed in 1907. In 1964 the lions were restored and weatherproofed by Washington-based sculptor Renato Luccetti, although this restoration proved to be less than entirely successful. When a major rehabilitation of the bridge began in 1993, the lions, which were in very bad condition, were removed for further restoration. They are currently stored in the Air Rights Tunnel on southbound I-395. The sculptures were finally found to be beyond restoring. The United States Commission of Fine Arts worked with the city in the late 1990s to oversee the production of the replacement lions that now sit on the bridge. The sculptor Reinaldo Lopez- Carrizo of Professional Restoration produced molds based on the existing sculptures and photographs, and used them to cast new concrete lion sculptures that were installed on the bridge in July and August 2000. The same molds were used to cast bronze lions installed at the main pedestrian entrance to the National Zoo farther north on Connecticut Avenue in 2002. The white lion in the lobby of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is a quarter-size replica from that effort. Bairstow Eagle Lampposts Twenty-four lampposts are equally spaced along both sides of the Taft Bridge. Created by sculptor Ernest Bairstow in 1906 ,the lampposts are composed of concrete bases (about 5 feet high, 8 inches deep and four feet wide) with painted iron lampposts (about 17 feet high and 4 wide) set in them. The pedestals are decorated with garland and a fluted column featuring acanthus leaves at the top and bottom. Above the leaves is a horizontal bracket with two globes hanging from each side of the column. Each lamppost is topped with a painted iron eagle with its wings spread. A replica of the Bairstow eagles is seen in a World War I monument in Middletown, Delaware.

It connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway line just west of Lebreton Flats, and crosses the south channel of the river to Lemieux Island; it then continues across the northern channel into Quebec. It is a multi-span Pratt truss bridge, consisting of six equal spans over the south channel, and seven spans over the north channel; the second- last span, proceeding northward, is longer by a factor of about 1.7. History The bridge was built by the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway in 1880, named for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. At that time, it was one of the few crossings of the Ottawa River, and was one of the most valuable assets of the line, which was owned by the Quebec provincial government. The QMO&O; continued to lose money, however, and it was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1882, which connected it with their other recent purchase, the Canada Central Railway. This connection gave the CPR a solid rail route from their westward line being built from North Bay to the ports of the St. Lawrence. The Prince of Wales Bridge was joined by the CPR's Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge in 1901, the second railway bridge to cross the river between Ottawa and Hull. The Prince of Wales Bridge served well into the 20th century, but as rail transport diminished and more efficient routes became more common, the line saw less traffic. In 1999, the City of Ottawa leased the CPR line, including the Prince of Wales Bridge for the construction of the Trillium Line. The bridge was used by rail traffic for the last time on July 26, 2001. In 2005, the bridge was disconnected from the tracks just before its approach on the Ottawa side; this was done for a water line project being built along the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway as part of the Lebreton Flats revitalization. The bridge has remained unused and the section of track between the Bayview Station and the bridge is overgrown. As the purchase of the bridge included the approaches on both sides, the City of Ottawa now owns property in Quebec. Future The Prince of Wales Bridge, south approach, July 2005 The Prince of Wales Bridge is now at the centre of controversy regarding current access and use by pedestrians. The disused bridge has for years served as a quick link between Gatineau and Ottawa for pedestrians, sunset watchers and dog walkers. These users want the bridge to remain open for their enjoyment. On the other hand, city officials have been pointing out safety and other concerns related to the bridge for some time. Between January 1, 2005 and August 29, 2016 the Ottawa Police Service has received 51 calls about activities at the bridge, three of which resulted in charges being laid, though no complaints related to the structural safety of the bridge itself, rather to possible criminal activity occurring on the property. With City of Gatineau officials now showing great interest in the Prince of Wales bridge as a transit link between the two cities,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/tramway-ottawa-gatineau- proposal-1.3769612 modifications would need to be made, as there is only enough room for a single track on the bridge, and the City of Ottawa has now permanently built over this rail infrastructure to create the new Trillium Line station at Bayviewhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/rail-line-breach- of-duty-city-ottawa-1.4151285. In September 2016 the City of Ottawa spent $46,000 to install new chain-link fences to block entrance to the bridge, although the fence was breached shortly afterwards. In September 2016, a pop- up picnic led by residents was organized in opposition to the proposed barricades. As of the end of the year 2016, the city has no plans to convert the bridge into a pedestrian or cycling path, which it says will cost $10.5 million. Rather, their stated goal is to use the bridge as an interprovincial rail link, connecting OC Transpo‚Äôs Trillium Line with Gatineau‚Äôs rapid transit network, although there has now been permanent and illegal building over of this rail infrastructure by the City of Ottawahttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/rail-line-breach-of-duty-city- ottawa-1.4151285. It was also proposed that this rail link might become part of a proposed commuter rail systemMoose Consortium. In February 2018, the Canadian Transportation Agency ruled that the city breached its duty as a rail line owner when it dismantled a section of tracks near Prince of Wales Bridge in order to build a new entrance to Bayview Station of the new Light Rail System. The CTA gave the City of Ottawa two options: to either try to sell a portion of the rail line leading to the Prince of Wales Bridge or to restore the tracks so they can accommodate rail traffic within 12 months.

It aired on Saturday evenings at 7 p.m. ET. The show debuted in the fall of 1988 and ran until CNN cancelled it in 2005.\\"CNN Disbands 'Capital Gang' As Part of Schedule Shakeup.\\" By John Maynard. The Washington Post. Friday, June 24, 2005; Page C07. The original panel was Pat Buchanan, Robert Novak, Al Hunt, and Mark Shields. Mona Charen and Margaret Warner joined the panel in 1992, when Buchanan left the show to run for president in 1992. In 1993, Warner left the program to join PBS and was replaced by Margaret Carlson, and Kate O'Beirne replaced Charen when she moved to Capital Gang Sunday in 1995. Typically four of the commentators were featured along with a prominent public official from either party. Buchanan, O'Beirne, Charen and Novak were the conservative panelists, while Shields, Hunt, Warner and Carlson were the liberal commentators. Capital Gang Sunday was hosted by James Glassman in the mid-1990s. It featured panelists Juan Williams, Howard Fineman, Ruth Conniff, James Warren, and Mona Charen. The show did not feature any guests and was more cerebral than combative, in contrast to the Saturday version. In 1998, it was canceled, along with CNN's Sunday edition of Crossfire. In 2005, after overall declining ratings at the network, CNN attempted to shake up its programming by cancelling several of its politically oriented shows, including the Capital Gang and Crossfire. The Capital Gang panelists appeared together again on NBC's Meet the Press with Tim Russert on February 17, 2008. With the Democratic nomination race still very much undecided, and the role of the superdelegates in question, Hunt, Carlson, Shields, Novak and O'Beirne gathered to discuss the issues.

Until they can be proved, allegations remain merely assertions. See definition at law.com There are also marital allegations: marriage bonds and allegations exist for couples who applied to marry by licence. They do not exist for couples who married by banns. The marriage allegation was the document in which the couple alleged (or frequently just the groom alleged on behalf of both of them) that there were no impediments to the marriage. Generally, in a civil complaint, a plaintiff alleges facts sufficient to establish all the elements of the claim and thus states a cause of action. The plaintiff must then carry the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion in order to succeed in the lawsuit. A defendant can allege affirmative defenses in its answer to the complaint. Other allegations are required in a pleading to establish the correct jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction. Disjunctive allegations Disjunctive allegations are allegations in a pleading joined together by an \\"or\\". In a complaint, disjunctive allegations are usually per se defective because such a pleading does not put the party on notice of which allegations they must defend. On the other hand, defendants often plead in the alternative by listing seemingly inconsistent defenses. For example, \\"I did not do the crime\\", \\"if I did, I didn't know\\", or \\"even if I did know, I've got a good excuse\\". Such a pleading may be considered disjunctive and may be permissible.

Limited Commercial license, serial number 250, issued for a one year period to J. C. Hobrecht for operation of KVQ on 360 meters (833 kHz). It was operated in conjunction with the Sacramento Bee newspaper, and made its debut broadcast on February 2, 1922.\\"Victor Artists Will Give Bee Radio Concert To-day\\", Sacramento Bee, February 2, 1922, page 1. A few months later, ownership was transferred from J. C.

KFBK was first licensed, as the city's second broadcasting station, on August 16, 1922 to the Kimball-Upson Company,\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1922, page 3. and initially was operated in conjunction with the Bee's primary competitor, the Sacramento Union. The call letters were sequentially assigned from an alphabetic list maintained by the Department of Commerce, which regulated radio in the United States at this time. KFBK began test transmissions in early September,\\"KFBK Ready For Test; Tune Up And Listen\\", Sacramento Union, September 2, 1922, page 1. and made its formal debut broadcast on September 17, 1922.\\"KFBK in Rare Tune For Sunday Night's Big Radio Concert\\", Sacramento Union, September 16, 1922, page 8. Initially there was only a single wavelength, 360 meters (833 kHz), available for radio station \\"entertainment\\" broadcasts,\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. which required stations in various regions to develop timesharing agreements assigning operating hours. As of November 1, 1922 there were seven \\"Inland Stations\\" sharing time on 360 meters, with KFBK allocated 6:00 to 6:30 P.M. daily except Sunday, plus 8:00 to 9:00 P.M.

A series of reassignments followed, until November 11, 1928 when, under the provisions of Commerce's General Order 40, the station was assigned to a low-powered \\"Local\\" frequency, 1310 kHz.\\"Broadcasting Stations, Alphabetically By Call Signals, Effective November 11, 1928\\" Commercial and Government Radio Stations of the U.S. (June 30, 1928), page 167 As was true with most stations in the early 1920s, KFBK was initially operated without advertising, and was primarily used for publicity purposes. The Sacramento Union eventually ended its close association with the station. In 1925 the Sacramento Bee saw this as an opportunity to re-enter the broadcasting field which it had left nearly three years earlier when it had shut down KVQ, but now on a commercial basis. Effective September 1, 1925, the James McClatchy Company, a local, family-owned company which owned the Sacramento Bee, Modesto Bee and Fresno Bee newspapers, made an agreement with station owner Kimball-Upson for a half interest in KFBK's equipment and good will. The Kimball-Upson company was granted a $3,000 credit for advertisements placed in the Bee, while the newspaper company agreed to enlarge the station's studio and pay for KFBK's operating and maintenance expenses. As part of this arrangement, McClatchy assumed control over all airtime sales at the station, with net profits up to $6,000 shared equally between the two partners, and 80% of any higher profits going to McClatchy.\\"Sacramento Bee Calling, Hello, Hello\\" (chapter 2), Sacramento on the Air: How the McClatchy Family Revolutionized West Coast Broadcasting by Annette Kassis, 2015. The station's new status was formally introduced by a special broadcast made on September 5, 1925.\\"To-night Marks Entry Of The Bee-Kimball-Upson Radio Station On Broadcast Circles of The State\\", Sacramento Bee, September 5, 1925, page 1. In early 1929, ownership of KFBK was transferred from Kimball-Upson to the James McClatchy Company.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 31, 1929, page 7. McClatchy later acquired additional radio stations in the region, including KBEE in Modesto and KMJ in Fresno. From 1964 to 1978, KFBK was a sister station to Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto TV station KOVR. The cluster of KFBK, KBEE and KOVR was possible because Sacramento and Modesto, then as now, are separate radio markets. In 1936 KFBK was granted permission to make a major upgrade, going from 100 watts on 1310 kHz to 5,000 watts on the \\"High Powered Regional\\" frequency of 1490 kHz, which had previously been exclusively assigned to WCKY in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1937 KFBK increased power again, to 10,000 watts. In March 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KFBK and WCKY shifted to 1530 kHz, a frequency designated as a \\"Clear Channel\\" assignment, with both stations now classified as \\"Class I-B\\".\\"United States Assignments\\", Arrangement between the United States of America, Canada, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Mexico, comprising recommendations of the North American Regional Radio- Engineering Meeting (supplemental to North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement [NARBA], Habana, 1937), page 1443. On October 2, 1948, KFBK increased its power to 50,000 watts, concurrent with the installation of a directional antenna to limit its signal toward WCKY. =1950s and 1960s= As television took over network programming, KFBK reinvented itself as a news, information, sports, and entertainment station. Because of its strong signal and location in the heart of the Central Valley, the station became the chief source for farmers to obtain weather reports and price and other farming information. KFBK carried CBS Radio Network programming including top-of-the- hour newscasts, plus specialized reports from Edward R. Murrow and Lowell Thomas. Local news programs included the Richfield Reporter. Tony Koester was both the long-time voice of the minor league Sacramento Solons and the station's sports director. When the San Francisco Giants arrived in 1958, the station began a long partnership carrying their games. Entertainment programming included Arthur Godfrey and Doug Pledger.Sacramento Radio History =The talk of the town= In the 1970s, with less network programming available, KFBK began programming talk shows as part of their broadcast day, promoting them as \\"The Talk of the Town\\". After a brief trial as an adult contemporary music station, ownership committed themselves to a format that included news blocks during morning and afternoon drive time, with the remainder of the day's programming featuring local talk shows. With the U.S. Federal Communications Commission implementing a newspaper-broadcasting cross- ownership rule, McClatchy was forced to divest itself of its radio and television stations. KFBK was sold to Westinghouse Broadcasting and later shifted network affiliation to ABC Radio. =KFBK begins FM simulcasting= KFBK-FM began simulcasting KFBK on December 1, 2011 at 92.5 FM, the former home of KGBY. This was mainly to fill in areas east of Sacramento where the AM signal is weaker at night due to the need to protect WCKY. Beginning on December 26, 2013 KFBK briefly operated a trimulcast, adding 93.1 FM, the former home of Classic 93.1 (KHLX); this ended a week later when KGBY adopted a country music format as KBEB. =Changes in ownership= KFBK was acquired by Chancellor Media in 1997.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-58 Chancellor was acquired by Clear Channel Communications a few years later. And Clear Channel changed its name to iHeartMedia, Inc. Prominent staff members During the 1980s, KFBK employed Morton Downey, Jr. as a local midday host. Downey later went on to host a popular nationally syndicated weekday TV show. After Downey's departure, Rush Limbaugh replaced him at the station. Limbaugh first rose to prominence at KFBK before becoming nationally syndicated in 1988 and his national program still airs on KFBK in the same time slot (9:00 a.m.-noon) where he hosted locally. Limbaugh's local replacement, Tom Sullivan was also nationally syndicated, also working for the Fox Business Network. Sullivan continues to be heard on KFBK weekday afternoons. A number of other KFBK alumni have gained national prominence. Former KFBK news reporter/anchor Laura Ingle is a featured reporter on Fox News Channel. Former KFBK reporter and weekend anchor Todd Starnes hosted a weekday show on Fox News Radio and currently owns a radio station in Memphis, Tennessee. Former KFBK evening host Spencer Hughes hosted a weekday program Fox Across America on Fox News Radio.

The region affected by the orogeny, the Uralian orogenic belt or the Uralides, is usually thought of as the boundary between Europe and Asia. It extends from the Aral Sea to Novaya Zemlya, and it includes in addition to the Ural Mountains, the Pay-Khoy Ridge of northwest Russia and the Mugodzhar Hills of northwest Kazakhstan. Its total length is about , of which the Ural Mountains are about . At the latitude of the Middle-Urals Ring Structure (c. 56¬∞ N, between Perm and Ufa) the Ural mountains have a eastward-convex bend. It has been proposed that the Precambrian Middle-Urals Ring Structure caused a disturbance in the orogeny leading to the formation the bend.G. Burba (2003). The geologic evolution of the Ural Mountains: A supposed exposure to a giant impact. Microsymposium 38, MS011, 2003 Formation The Uralian orogen (sensu stricto) occurred between three Palaeozoic continents, Baltica, Kazakhstania, and Siberia. In the late Precambrian, the northeast margin of Baltica was deformed in the Timanide and Cadomide orogenies or the assembly of the Pannotia supercontinent. The break-up of this supercontinent opened the Palaeo-Uralian Ocean, in which a number of unidentified continental fragments rifted from Baltica. As Baltica collided with Laurentia to form Laurussia, island arcs and other microcontinents were accreted to Baltica in the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous. In the Ordovician-Silurian, Kazakhstania formed separately when subduction-driven growth accreted crust to a series of small, late Precambrian microcontinents. In the early Late Carboniferous, Kazakhstania began to collide with Laurussia as the Palaeo-Uralian ocean subducted beneath the margins of the latter. The northern continuation of the Ural mountains, the Pay-Khoy-Novaya Zemlya foldbelt, is the result of the collision between Laurussia and Siberia in the Early Jurassic.

The main block was built circa 1714, incorporating some older work, in 3 storeys in brick with a seven window frontage. In 1808, 2-storey bow fronted wings and a semi-circular Doric portico were added and the whole building painted to resemble stone. The wings were later raised to 3 storeys.  History  John Greame, son of Robert Greame, was the first of the Greame family to live at the old manor house at Sewerby. He had become quite wealthy on the death of his father in 1708 and bought the estate from Elizabeth Carleill, the last of the previous family to own the property. He built the present Sewerby Hall between 1714-1720, replacing the manor house which had existed on the site for many years. John died in 1746 at the age of 83. His son John Greame II died childless in 1798 at the age of 98, and his widow Alicia Maria (n√©e Spencer) stayed on at the hall until her own death in 1812. It then passed to a nephew, a third John Greame, who had married an heiress, Sarah Yarburgh of Heslington Hall, York. Sarah had died young and John Greame III had remarried and moved with his second wife to live in Sewerby Hall with his Aunt Almary. Carving at Sewerby Hall He commissioned a number of alterations including the addition of a portico in 1808. On his death in 1841 ownership passed to his eldest son Yarburgh Greame, who also took the surname Yarburgh on inheriting his mother's estate at Heslington. Yarburgh made many improvements to the house and gardens at Sewerby, including a large conservatory called the Orangery in the mid 19th century, a clock tower in 1847, and finally a gatehouse in 1848. He also built a church and a school, designed by Sir Gilbert Scott, on the edge of the estate. He died in 1876 at the age of 70 and the estate went to his sister Alicia Maria, the wife of George Lloyd of Stockton Hall, at Stockton-on-the-Forest, York, and afterwards to their younger son, the Revd Yarburgh Gamaliel Lloyd, a Lincolnshire vicar. He changed his name to Lloyd-Greame and his son, Colonel Yarburgh George Lloyd-Greame, inherited in 1890. The Colonel's elder son, also Yarburgh Lloyd- Greame, sold the house and part of the estate to Bridlington Corporation in 1934. In 1936, the hall and park was opened to the public with a ceremony on 1 June by aviator Amy Johnson. During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force used the house as a hospital and convalescent home for the RAF bases in the area. In May 2012 plans for a ¬£2.6 million restoration project moved forward with a ¬£949,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund with the work expected to take 30 months. The first phase of the project (new offices, classrooms and a shop), was started in November 2012 and was completed in August 2013. The second phase to restore the interior of the hall was started in September 2013. The restoration work was completed by August 2014.  Attractions  Today, Sewerby Hall is a major tourist attraction in the East Riding of Yorkshire, attracting over 150,000 visitors a year. The hall now houses the Museum of East Yorkshire, including a room dedicated to Amy Johnson, and the Coastguard Museum. The grounds of the hall are home to a small zoo and aviary as well as an 18-hole putting green, 9-hole Pitch and putt and various gardens. As well as tourist activities, the hall also hosts many local community events. The home ground of Sewerby Cricket Club is situated within the grounds, near the cliff top.

The rules prohibited members from entering into a partnership with anyone who was not a resident of Alberta, and prohibited members from being partners of more than one firm. This rule was challenged as being contrary to the mobility rights protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In the resulting court case, Black v.

Klehr is known for his books on the subject of the American Communist movement, and on Soviet espionage in America (many written jointly with John Earl Haynes). Early years He was born in Newark, New Jersey. He received his Bachelor's degree from Franklin and Marshall College in 1967. He received his doctorate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1971, after defending a dissertation entitled The Theory of American Exceptionalism.Harvey Klehr, The Theory of American Exceptionalism. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1971. OCLC 35634126. Klehr later recalled that his interest in the American radical left had been shaped by the domestic political upheaval of the era of the Vietnam War during which he had attended college.Harvey Klehr, \\"Preface\\" to The Communist Experience in America: A Political and Social History. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2010; pg. x. In 2010, Klehr wrote: > [...] I originally intended to study traditional American politics, but > became distracted by the upheavals of the era.

Academic career Following graduation, Klehr was hired to teach political theory at Emory University in Atlanta.Klehr, \\"Preface\\" to The Communist Experience in America, pg. xii. After generating several journal articles from his dissertation, Klehr moved to the study of the demographic composition of the party leadership of the Communist Party, USA, agglomerating biographical information from archival study and person-to person interviews, Klehr examined the social composition of the party's leadership caste for the first time. The result of this research was a first book, Communist Cadre: The Social Background of the American Communist Party Elite, published in 1978 by the Hoover Institution Press.Klehr, \\"Preface\\" to The Communist Experience in America, pg. xiii. Klehr's book drew the attention of Theodore Draper, a pioneering historian of American communism who had published seminal books on the topic in 1957 and 1960 on the story of the American communist movement from its origins to 1929 but had found himself unable to continue the saga into later years despite having accumulated a substantial research library on the topic. Draper pushed Klehr to continue his history to include its glory days in the years of the Great Depression. Klehr made possible the acquisition of Draper's archive by Emory University Library and began intensive study of the topic. The result was the publication of a second book in 1984, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. In the nearly quarter-century between the publication of Draper's second book on American communism and Klehr's 1984 effort at continuation, a new school of social historians had come to the fore in the field of American history, an unorganized group sharing a disaffection with the \\"traditionalist\\" orientation towards leaders and the machinations of high politics. These self-described \\"revisionists\\" made Klehr's 1984 work a focus of heated intellectual critique by asserting that it was an example of polemic Cold War anti-Communism. The highly politicized argument was returned in kind by the so-called \\"traditionalists,\\" who frequently saw in the \\"revisionists'\\" predilection for local history and the party rank-and-file a thinly-disguised apologetic for the abuses of communism \\"glorifying the CPUSA, hiding its warts, and apologizing for its crimes.\\"Klehr, \\"Preface\\" to The Communist Experience in America, pg. xiv. For more than two decades, the debate raged among historians of American radicalism, with Klehr emerging as one of the leading defenders of the \\"traditionalist\\" approach and its associated critique. The historical approaches were largely connected to the contemporary views of their adherents, Klehr later noted: > The disagreements between the two camps were only partly generational, > because some traditionalists, like myself and my long-time co-author John > Haynes, were roughly the same age as our revisionist counterparts. To some > degree, the combatants were divided by current political loyalties, with > most revisionists locating themselves at least on the left wing of the > Democratic Party, if not as members of various socialist groupings. But > traditionalists themselves ranged from such self-identified socialists as > Irving Howe to conservative Republicans. Awards Klehr has received a number of awards, including Emory's Thomas Jefferson Award (in 1999). He was a member of the National Council on the Humanities, served a term that expired in 2010.

The battle, which took place on July 3, 1754, was an early battle of the French and Indian War, and resulted in the surrender of British colonial forces under Colonel George Washington, to the French and Indians, under Louis Coulon de Villiers. The site also includes the Mount Washington Tavern, once one of the inns along the National Road, and in two separate units the grave of British General Edward Braddock, killed in 1755, and the site of the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Battle of Fort Necessity (1754) An engraving depicting the evening council of George Washington at Fort Necessity. After returning to the great meadows in northwestern Virginia, and what is now Fayette County, Pennsylvania, George Washington decided it prudent to reinforce his position. Supposedly named by Washington as Fort Necessity or Fort of Necessity, the structure protected a storehouse for supplies such as gunpowder, rum, and flour. The crude palisade they erected was built more to defend supplies in the fort's storehouse from Washington's own men, whom he described as \\"loose and idle\\", than as a planned defense against a hostile enemy. The sutler of Washington's force was John Fraser, who earlier had been second-in-command at Fort Prince George. Later he served as Chief Scout to General Edward Braddock and then Chief Teamster to the Forbes Expedition. By June 13, 1754, Washington had under his command 295 colonials and the nominal command of 100 additional regular British army troops from South Carolina. Washington spent the remainder of June 1754 extending the wilderness road further west and down the western slopes of the Allegheny range into the valley of the Monongahela River. He wanted to create a river crossing point roughly away, near Redstone Creek and Redstone Old Fort. This was a prehistoric Native American earthwork mound on a bluff overlooking the river crossing. The aboriginal mound structure may have once been part of a fortification. Five years later in the war, Fort Burd was constructed at Redstone Old Fort. The area eventually became the site of Nemacolin Castle and Brownsville, Pennsylvaniaan important western jumping-off point for travelers crossing the Alleghenies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. To reach the Ohio River basins' navigable waters as soon as possible on the Monongahela River, Washington chose to follow Nemacolin's Trail, a Native American trail which had been somewhat improved by colonists, with Nemacolin's help. He preferred this to following the ridge-hopping, high-altitude path traversed by the western part of the route that was later chosen for Braddock's Road. It jogged to the north near the fort and passed over another notch near Confluence, Pennsylvania into the valley and drainage basin of the Youghiogheny River. The Redstone destination at the terminus of Nemacolin's Trail was a natural choice for an advanced base. The location was one of the few known good crossing points where both sides of the wide deep river had low accessible banks; steep sides were characteristic of the Monongahela River valley. Late in the day on July 3, Washington did not know the French situation. Believing his situation was impossible, he accepted surrender terms which allowed the peaceful withdrawal of his forces, which he completed on July 4, 1754.Leckie, 276 The French subsequently occupied the fort and then burned it. Washington did not speak French, and stated later that if he had known that he was confessing to the \\"assassination\\" of Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, he would not have signed the surrender document. An old Postcard of the Mount Washington Tavern. Park formation and structure During the Great Depression of the 20th century, attempts to preserve the location of Fort Necessity were undertaken. On March 4, 1931, Congress declared the location a National Battlefield Site under management of the War Department. Transferred to the National Park Service in 1933, the park was redesignated a National Battlefield on August 10, 1961. As with all historic sites administered by the National Park Service, the battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Subsequent archaeological research helped to uncover the majority of the original fort position, shape and design. A replica of the fort was constructed on site in the 1970s. A new visitor center, which also is home to a National Road interpretive center, opened on October 8, 2005. The battlefield and fort are currently being improved. Mount Washington Tavern The Mount Washington Tavern, built as a stagecoach stop for early travelers on the National Road. On a hillside adjacent to the battlefield and within the boundaries of the park is Mount Washington Tavern, a classic example of the many inns once lining the National Road, the United States' first federally funded highway. The land on which the tavern was built was originally owned by George Washington. In 1770 he purchased the site on which he had commanded his first battle. Around the 1830s, Judge Nathanial Ewing of Uniontown constructed the tavern. James Sampey acquired the tavern in 1840. It was operated by his family until the railroad construction boom caused the National Road to decline in popularity, rendering the inn unprofitable. In 1855, it was sold to the Fazenbaker family. They used it as a private home for the next 75 years, until the Commonwealth Of Pennsylvania purchased the property in 1932. In 1961 the National Park Service purchased the property from the state, making the building a part of Fort Necessity. The Mount Washington Tavern demonstrates the standard features of an early American tavern, including a simple barroom that served as a gathering place, a more refined parlor that was used for relaxation, and bedrooms in which numerous people would crowd to catch up on sleep. General Braddock's grave site The grave of General Edward Braddock. Dedication Plaque In a separate unit of the park, lying about one mile (1.6 km) northwest of the battlefield, is the grave of General Edward Braddock. The British commander led a major expedition to the area in 1755 which included the construction of Braddock's Road, a useful but inadequate wilderness road through western Pennsylvania. Braddock was severely wounded in the Battle of the Monongahela as the British advanced toward Fort Duquesne. He and his forces fled along the wilderness road to a site near Great Meadows. Braddock died on July 13, 1755, and was buried in an elaborate ceremony officiated by George Washington. He was buried under the road in order to hide the location of his grave from the enemy French and Indians.Fort Necessity - National Park Service In 1804 Braddock's remains were discovered by men making repairs to the wilderness road. A marker was erected in 1913.

It is the oldest Christian artefact in the Philippines, originally a gift from explorer Ferdinand Magellan to Rajah Humabon and his chief consort on account of their baptism in 1521. The dark wood statue measures approximately twelve inches tall, and carved in the Flemish style. It depicts the Child Jesus, with a serene countenance, in the attitude and dress of a Spanish monarch. The statue bears imperial regalia, including a golden crown, globus cruciger, and various sceptres, wears fine vestments, and possesses jewelry mostly offered by devotees over several centuries. Pope Paul VI granted a Canonical Coronation of the statue on 28 April 1965 and later raised its shrine to the status of Minor Basilica on 2 May 1965 via his Papal bull Cubanula Religionis to mark the fourth centenary of Christianity in the Philippine Islands., Quote: \\"As a gesture of reverence, the pilgrims would approach the image to give the foot of the idol's votive stand a kiss or a loving touch, satisfying the ultimate aim of their journey: to draw ever nearer to the Santo Nino de Cebu\\". The image is replicated in various parts of the country with different titles and is one of the most beloved and recognizable Filipino cultural icons. The annual dancing feast of Sinulog is held every January on the third Sunday in its honor. Today, the original image is permanently encased behind bulletproof glass inside its chapel within the Minor Basilica del Santo Ni√±o.Bryan Christy (2012), Ivory worship, National Geographic; Quote:\\"Some Filipinos believe the Santo Ni√±o de Cebu is Christ himself. Sixteenth-century Spaniards declared the icon to be miraculous and used it to convert the nation, making this single wooden statue, housed today behind bulletproof glass in Cebu‚Äôs Bas√≠lica Minore del Santo Ni√±o, the root from which all Filipino Catholicism has grown. Earlier this year a local priest was asked to resign after allegedly advising his parishioners that the Santo Ni√±o and images of the Virgin Mary and other saints were merely statues made of wood and cement.\\" History The Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ image was originally produced by Flemish artisans, according to a hagiography, based on a vision of Teresa of Avila, a mystic of the 16th century., Quote: \\"The Santo Ni√±o statue, the beloved new image, which found its place among its indigenous relatives in the Raja's home, was a product of Flemish artisans...\\" In early 1521, the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, in the service of Charles V of Spain, was on his voyage to find a westward route to the Spice Islands. On April 7, 1521, he landed in Limasawa, Southern Leyte, and met a local ruler named Raja Kulambu, who introduced him to Rajah Humabon, ruler of Cebu Island, and his chief consort, Hara Humamay. On April 14, 1521, Magellan presented them with three gifts: an Ecce Homo (Ivory Bust of Jesus), an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Santo Ni√±o as part of their baptism, and a strategic alliance for territorial conquest. As the host ruler adopted the Catholic faith, he took the Christian name of Carlos (after Charles V), while Humamay was christened Juana (after Joanna of Castile, Charles' mother). According to Antonio Pigafetta ‚Äì Magellan's companion and memoir writer, along with the ruler, about 500 males there, along with the Queen and 40 women were also converted by Father Valderrama. At the ceremony, for example, the Raja Kulambu of Limawasa also converted and was renamed Don Juan, while his Muslim captain was renamed Don Cristobal. A few days after the baptism, Magellan undertook a war expedition on the behalf of the newly named Carlos, attacking Mactan Island and burning down hamlets who resisted. The residents led by Lapu Lapu defended Magellan's attack with force, and Magellan died on 27 April 1521 in the Battle of Mactan, about three weeks after he had arrived in Philippines. After Magellan's death, his Spanish colleagues left. The next Spanish expedition arrived on April 27, 1565, again to gain a foothold for a colony to trade spices, and this was led by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi. He attempted a peaceful colonization, but these efforts were rejected. He opened fire on Cebu and burnt the coastal town down destroying 1500 homes and possibly killing 500 people. In the ruins of this destruction, the Spanish mariner Juan Camus found the image of the Santo Ni√±o in a pine box. According to the local legend, the survival of the statue was seen as a sign of miracle by the colonizers, and ever since it has been believed to have miraculous powers. The image of the Santo Ni√±o is the oldest surviving Catholic relic in the Philippines, along with the Magellan cross. A church to house Santo Ni√±o was built on the spot where the image was found by Juan Camus. The church was originally made out of bamboo and mangrove palm and claims to be the oldest parish in the Philippines. It was reconstructed later, and Pope Paul VI elevated it to the status of Minor Basilica on its 400th anniversary (Spanish: Bas√≠lica Menor del Santo Ni√±o). Feast Devotees flock to the Bas√≠lica Menor del Santo Ni√±o during the novena masses. The feast, locally known as Fiesta Se√±or, starts on the Thursday after the Solemnity of the Epiphany. Each year, the celebration starts with a dawn procession wherein the replica image of Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ is brought down to the streets. It is then followed by the novena Masses, which span nine days. On the last day of the novena, another dawn procession is held wherein the image of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Ceb√∫ removed from its shrine and brought to the Bas√≠lica Menor. After the procession, it will stay for a while in the Basilica. Then, the images of Santo Ni√±o de Cebu and Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Ceb√∫ are brought to the National Shrine of St. Joseph in Mandaue City to be reunited with the icon of the church's namesake, thus forming the Holy Family. This transfer, which is common in fiestas throughout the country, is called Traslaci√≥n. On the morning of the v√≠speras (\\"eve\\", i.e., the day before) of the feast, the images of Santo Ni√±o de Cebu and Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Ceb√∫ are brought back to Cebu City in a fluvial procession that concludes with a reenactment of the first Mass and baptism in the islands. It is then followed by a grand yet solemn foot procession in the afternoon, culminating in a Pontifical Mass concelebrated by bishops and priests. The grand Sinulog Festival is then held on the following Sunday. = The Hubo rite = The Sinulog procession includes dancing and fiesta in reverence of Santo Nino. Above, a Sinulog participant carrying a copy of the Santo Nino statue. The festival officially ends on the Friday after the icon's feast day, and it is marked with the traditional Hubo (Cebuano, \\"undress\\") rite. During a Mass, the basilica's priests and sacristans ceremoniously and reverently strip the Santo Ni√±o of its festal vestments and regalia. There is a strict order of divesting the icon: first the crown is removed, followed by the orb and sceptre; then the cape; then the sash and tunic, and finally, the inner garments. The priest recites a short petition before each removal, which is marked with a festive drum roll. The priest then chants Christe exaudi nos (Latin for ‚ÄúChrist, graciously hear us‚Äù). The priest then raises the icon for veneration, carefully dips it in a basin of scented water four times, and wipes it dry. He then dresses it in a plainer set of robes, and replaces the regalia in reverse order of divesture. Upon replacing each item, he intones a prayer and leads the congregation in singing the refrain of the Laudes Regi√¶: Christus Vincit; Christus Regnat; Christus, Christus Imperat (‚ÄúChrist Conquers; Christ Reigns; Christ Commands‚Äù). Drum rolls then announce the moment as the insignia are worn. The rite is explained as highlighting Christ's humility, and on the part of the individual believer, it should inspire an internal, spiritual conversion. It was only in 1990 when the Augustinian priests caring for the icon first made the rite public. The Hubo Mass today is held on the Friday following the feast day at the Pilgrim Center outside the Basilica, and the masses following generally mark the termination of the long celebrations. Pontifical approbation The original feast date for the image was April 28, but in the 18th century, the following changes were made: * Pope Innocent XIII moved the date to avoid conflict with the Eastertide. In addition, he approved special liturgical texts for use during the local feast of the Santo Ni√±o in the Philippines, set on the third Sunday of January, followed by the Sinulog festival. * Saint Paul VI issued a Canonical Coronation for the image on 28 April 1965 via his Papal legate. Through the Papal bull \\"Ut Clarificetur\\", the same Pontiff raised the sanctuary a Minor Basilica on 2 May 1965. * Saint John Paul II gave his papal endorsement for the image in his Mass for Families in 1981. *Pope Francis, also endorsed the image and called the Santo Ni√±o \\"protector\\" of the Philippines, in his homily at the Rizal Park.http://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/50191/sto-nino-reminds-us-we-are-gods- children Military Honours During the Spanish colonial era, the Santo Ni√±o was given the high military rank of Captain-General, with the full title of \\"Celent√≠simo Capit√°n General de las Esfuerzas Espa√±olas en Filipinas\\" (The Most Esteemed Captain-General of the Spanish Forces in the Philippines). For this reason, the statue is vested in a red cape and sash, symbolising the rank of a general, and military boots. Presently, the rank is called Celentisimo Capitan General de las Esfuerzas en Filipinas, with the \\"Espa√±olas\\" dropped, thusly translating to Most Esteemed Captain-General of the Forces in the Philippines.\\"At the Malaca√±an sa Sugbu, a patrol craft, the RPS Heneral Emilio Aguinaldo which is the first Philippine-made navy ship was waiting Upon arrival, naval honors called ‚Äúside boys‚Äù were given as El Capitan General boarded the naval vessel. The flag of the Santo Ni√±o was then hoisted. This was the first time that the coat-of-arms of the Celentisimo Capitan General de las Esfuerzas en Filipinas was flown by a Philippine Navy ship. A Coast Guard ship and a civilian yacht were also parked alongside the navy ship as part of the convoy. The Coast Guard closed the Mactan Channel for the occasion.\\" - Se√±or Santo Ni√±o as El Capitan General: Lord Admiral of the Sea Further, the image was later honoured by the Philippine Navy with the title \\"Lord Admiral of the Sea\\" during the 446th anniversary of the image's Kaplag (\\"finding\\" or \\"rediscovery\\") in 2011.http://archives.pia.gov.ph/?m=1&t;=1&id;=49150&y;=2011&mo;=10http://www.philstar.com/cebu- news/2013/01/17/897988/sto.-nino-de-cebu-el-capitan-general This was done in acknowledgment of Christ's \\"lordship over seafarers, mariners and the marine ecology.\\" The image was taken aboard the naval ship BRP General Emilio Aguinaldo (PG-140) for a fluvial parade, marking the first time its own naval ensign bearing its coat-of-arms was flown by a Philippine naval vessel. The honour was a joint effort of the Naval Forces Central, Philippine Coast Guard- Cebu District, Cebu Ports Authority, Philippine National Police Maritime Group, among others.  Patronage  Original image of Our Lady of Guadalupe de Cebu The Santo Ni√±o was popularly considered the official patron of Cebu, but the Church in the Philippines suppressed the notion and clarified that it is not the representation of a saint that intercedes to God but rather God in the person of Jesus. Instead, the Archbishop of Cebu, Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, declared Our Lady of Guadalupe of Ceb√∫ as the principal patroness of Cebu in 2002. The devotion to the Santo Ni√±o is common with worldwide veneration of the Infant Jesus of Prague. The image is found in many houses, business establishments, and public transportation. Traditionally, the image is often dressed in one of two colours: red is common for domestic images, while green ‚Äì symbolising luck ‚Äì is worn by those enshrined in businesses. It is also often dressed in miniature costumes that often reflect the profession of its devotee such as physicians, nurses, policemen, or teachers. Another popular variation is the Santo Ni√±o de Atocha which in the country is uniquely in a standing pose rather than seated as with the Spanish version.

The term is most often used in the context of the application of local inertial frames to small regions of a gravitational field. Although gravitational tidal forces will cause the background geometry to become noticeably non-Euclidean over larger regions, if we restrict ourselves to a sufficiently small region containing a cluster of objects falling together in an effectively uniform gravitational field, their physics can be described as the physics of that cluster in a space free from explicit background gravitational effects. Equivalence principle When constructing his general theory of relativity, Einstein made the following observation: a freely falling object in a gravitational field will not be able to detect the existence of the field by making local measurements (\\"a falling man feels no gravity\\"). Einstein was then able to complete his general theory by arguing that the physics of curved spacetime must reduce over small regions to the physics of simple inertial mechanics (in this case special relativity) for small freefalling regions.

Dumbarton Bridge was built between 1914 and 1915 to convey Q Street Northwest across Rock Creek Park between the city's Dupont Circle and Georgetown neighborhoods. History =Proposals= Around 1905, the residents of Georgetown wanted to reduce traffic to Washington along M Street. One frequently proposed idea was to divert the water of Rock Creek through a tunnel under current-day 27th Street NW, then fill in Rock Creek's beds, and extend Georgetown's streets to Washington. Many Georgetown residents disliked Rock Creek because it was filled with stagnant water and trash. The cost of diverting and filling in the creek was estimated to be $4.5 million. Estimates to build the bridge ranged from $150,000 to $200,000, while the estimate to divert and fill in the creek and extend streets $1.3 million. Another idea was to move the Woodley Lane Bridge to the Q Street location rather than build a new bridge altogether. Engineers determined that the cost to move the Woodley Lane bridge would be too great and the Woodley Lane Bridge would not be available to be moved until its replacement, the Connecticut Avenue Bridge, was completed. Legislation to fund the bridge's construction was introduced to Congress in December 1910, and Congress approved it two months later. Congress appropriated $275,000 to build the bridge and $75,000 to condemn property, including a land west of Rock Creek being used as a street car yard, in order to extend Q Street to the bridge. =Construction= The bridge's design was by Glenn Brown, and the engineering design was by Daniel B. Luten. The bridge is significant as showing the impact of the City Beautiful movement in Washington and the association of architects, engineers and sculptors with the city's new Commission of Fine Arts. The architects studied photographs of bridges around the world choosing as models a Roman aqueduct and a mountain bridge in Italy with intent to set a precedent for further city bridges. The color of the bridge's stone was intended to evoke the warm tones of Spain and Italy. Along with the buffalo theme the arches are decorated by Indian head designs by Glenn Brown based on a life mask of the Sioux Chief Kicking Bear in the Smithsonian Institution. The curved design is due to need to match the section of Q Street NW in Dupont Circle that is slightly north of the section in Georgetown. In order to accommodate the bridge's approach and to keep the street continuous within Georgetown the Dumbarton House, then known as Bellevue, was moved about northward from its original site in the middle of the current Q Street to its present position on the north side of the Street. The District requested bids to construct the bridge in June 1913, but none of the four bids were within the appropriated budget. The plans were modified so that there would only be five spans rather than seven in order to save costs. The project went out to bid again in November. A.L. Guidone won the construction bid. Its four buffalo sculptures, the largest cast in a single piece of bronze, are by Alexander Phimister Proctor, who also designed the lions on the Sixteenth Street Bridge. The budget to build the bridge was set at $275,000. Construction of the bridge began on March 14, 1914. Construction of the bridge was completed by October 1915, although it took two more months to grade and pave the roads leading up to the bridge. =Opening= The bridge was officially opened at 4 p.m. on December 24, 1915. It was then known as the Q Street Bridge. The bridge was lit by incandescent lamps. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia officially gave it the name of Dumbarton Bridge on June 5, 1916. According to the Commissioners' written statement, \\"Dumbarton bridge commemorates the name of the tract of land upon which was laid out the easterly part of Georgetown, and to which Ninian Beall received letters patent from the British crown.\\" The Dumbarton Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 16, 1973.

It may be considered the spiritual successor to the 1994 game SimTower. The lead designer, Yoot Saito, who also worked on SimTower, produced this game as a sequel to SimTower, adding several new features while retaining the same general interface and style. The game's premise is largely unchanged from its predecessor; players must build a profitable and unique tower block complete with various amenities and living accommodations, while balancing the needs of the occupants.  Gameplay  Exiting from basement shops to the lobby Using the provided starting funds, players must begin to build a tower from scratch. As in SimTower, offices and food courts can be built to generate income, as well as condos that can be sold to families. There are plenty of new facilities that can be placed such as rented apartments, vending machines and public restrooms for food court patrons. There are also many changes to existing items that featured in the original game, i.e. a notable difference between the shop item in Yoot Tower and the one originally in SimTower is that it no longer functions as a rented space where the player has no control over what the shop sells; rather the player is provided with different types of shop from the start from which the income they make is part of the player's earnings. Another interesting addition is the ability for players to build two or more towers next to each other and join them with sky bridges. Other income sources also exist, such as placing billboards outside and renting them out as advertisement space. Also new to this game is the ability to choose where the building is built. What the player can do in these locations varies, such as how many stories high the building can be, what the player is actually allowed to build, and how much money the player starts off with. The variation gives each location its own difficulty level compared to the others. Yoot Tower includes a non-invasive form of static in-game advertising. Users can place billboards for Apple Computer (in Mac version only) and Sega, whilst there are tenants featuring real-world stores like GameWorks, Orange Julius or Air Jamaica. Some updates include more real-world tenants and billboards. The Japanese version includes a Glico store. The Tower II is a fully 32-bit program unlike SimTower which was 16-bit. It can even run on all 64-bit Windows operating systems. The Tower II also has a resizable window that can support very high resolutions (3200 x 2160). Expansions A new addition of the game is the ability to expand the game using plug-ins released for download which would add new features, such as new facilities (e.g. additional shops, restaurants, and services, ranging from a Glico store to a swimming pool), new events, billboards, and movies, as well as other aspects of gameplay. Inspection of the game's official website through web archives indicates that although the American version never got any true additions, the Japanese version got several updates, including new movies and locations. However, none of these appear to have survived when the official websites relating to the game and its developer OPeNBooK9003 went offline between the years 2001 and 2002. Through translations on the Japanese downloads page, an Austin Powers movie can be downloaded. The original Tower II game came with Tokyo and Hawaii. The American version had Tokyo, Hawaii, and Kegon Falls. However, unlike in Japan, America did not get updates. In Japan, each expansion pack was sold under the Towerkit title. Locations =Waikiki, Hawaii= The easiest of the three scenarios, Hawaii has users building a mixed-use structure featuring condominia and hotels. After building up those plus an underground shopping mall, users can place a cathedral on the top floor (the 45th). =Tokyo, Japan= The advanced Tokyo level has users building a fast-paced tower with primarily offices and eventually other uses as well. Users place a stadium on the top level. =Kegon Falls= In this scenario, the player is required to construct mostly underground, building a vast underground tourist attraction through hotels, shops, and a museum. This was initially sold in Japan as an expansion, but is included in Yoot Tower and later The Tower II releases. =Statue of Liberty= This expansion, was released in Japan in February 1999 under the name Towerkit CD-ROM: The Statue of Liberty. It was also originally meant to be available to download from the American official website, but the English version never materialized. The expansion is rare in Japan. =Tokyo Tower= In this game, player build below Tokyo Tower. Yoot Saito also indicated the Tower team was working on another location, \\"Tokyo Tower\\", but the addition was only released in Japan as Towerkit. This is not to be confused with the \\"Tokyo\\" location. =Kyoto Station Bldg.= The Kyoto Station was launched as a product based on the Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys movie. This version was sold as Towerkit, or bundled with the base The Tower II game. =King Naniwa Building Legend= In this add-on, player built around Tsutenkaku. This version was sold as Towerkit, or bundled with the base The Tower II game. =Christmas Story= In this add-on, player builds a log building to collect Christmas-themed items. This version was sold as Towerkit and the rarest and most obscure of the released items. =Cancelled releases= *Lunar base *Luxury cruise ship *Hokkaid≈ç  Reception  The game was dismissed by some game review websites and magazines as being too much a rehash of the original SimTower. Many wrote the game off as being basically identical to its predecessor. Due to the average reviews and spotty distribution, the game was largely ignored by the mainstream gaming public after release, possibly contributing to its poor sales. This in turn is the most likely reason why none of the new locations or expansion plug-ins were ever localized for the English version. It sold well in Japan, however, and received several new plug-ins. Another criticism was that some in-game text was not localized effectively. This resulted in some minor text errors and unfamiliar items to American audiences (such as placing cigarette machines commonly).

He covered Philadelphia Eagles preseason games as an analyst with Scott Graham for several years. He currently works for NFL Network, where he serves as an analyst for the television show NFL Total Access. He played college football at Duke University. Early years Baldinger was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Always big, strong, and athletic for his age, Baldinger spent much of his youth playing a variety of sports in and around Cherry Hill, New Jersey. His family later moved to Apple Valley, Minnesota, then Massapequa, New York where he and his brothers became well-known locally as they continued to excel in sports. At Massapequa High School, he practiced football, basketball and track. College career After high school, he initially enrolled at the Naval Academy, but later decided to transfer to Nassau Community College, where he became an All-Coastal Conference tight end and also practiced basketball. In 1979, he transferred to Duke University, where he was converted into a guard because of his blocking ability. As a senior, he was voted the team's most improved player and started all 11 games. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Baldinger was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1982 NFL Draft on April 30. As a rookie, he appeared in 4 out of 9 games, playing mostly on special teams. In 1983, he saw playing time as a backup at center and guard. In 1984, he started two games at right tackle replacing an injured Phil Pozderac and also started 2 games at right guard in place of an injured Kurt Petersen. In 1985, he injured his right knee in the third preseason game against the Chicago Bears and was placed on the injured reserve list. In 1986, he was a backup at center and also played as a third tight end in short-yardage situations. On September 2, 1987, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a left knee injury he suffered in a preseason game. On October 24, he was activated to the regular season roster. He was declared inactive in 6 of the final 8 games. Baldinger wasn't re-signed after the season. During his time with the Cowboys, he played every offensive line position and also had a few snaps at tight end. =Indianapolis Colts= On July 19, 1988, he was signed as a free agent by the Indianapolis Colts, to provide depth in the case of a lengthy contract holdout by guard Ron Solt. He was the lightest member of the offensive line. He appeared in 16 games, starting three contests at right tackle. He caught his first career pass (37 yards) from a tackle-eligible position against the Green Bay Packers. In 1989, he appeared in all 16 games. He started the season opener at right tackle in place of Kevin Call and started 2 games at left tackle in place of an injured Chris Hinton. He also was used as tackle-eligible in short yardage situations. In 1990, he was named the starter at right guard for the first 8 games. In the second half of the season, he was moved to replace right tackle Call, who injured his left shoulder in the eighth game against the New York Giants. In 1991, he started 13 games at center in place of Ray Donaldson, who was lost for the season with a broken leg he suffered against the Los Angeles Raiders. =Buffalo Bills= On April 2, 1992, he was signed in Plan B free agency by the Buffalo Bills, joining his brother Gary Baldinger. He was released on August 31. =Philadelphia Eagles= On September 28, 1992, he was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Eagles to replace an injured John Hudson. In 1993, he started 4 games at right guard in place of an injured Eric Floyd. On June 4, 1994, he was released in a salary cap move, along with other 11 veterans. Broadcasting career Baldinger began his broadcasting career at Fox in 1997, providing analysis for NFL Europe games. The network was impressed with his soothing voice and handy repertoire of clich√©s, and promoted him to a color commentary slot for NFL games. Baldinger worked alongside play-by-play voices Ray Bentley, Curt Menefee, Joe Buck, Pat Summerall, Kenny Albert, and Dick Stockton. In May 2009, it was reported that Baldinger would be replaced by former NFL safety John Lynch on Fox's telecasts. Shortly thereafter, Baldinger was hired by Compass Media Networks to serve as lead analyst for their national radio broadcasts of select Sunday afternoon NFL games. Baldinger also co-hosts a talk show for Sporting News Radio during football season, and teaches seminars for Nadia Communications. He is the author of the book The Map to Clear Messages. Baldinger has previously co-hosted various radio shows, and now is a frequent contributor for a sports-talk radio show for Philadelphia's \\"97.5 The Fanatic\\" sports station, an ESPN Affiliate. Personal life A resident of Marlton, New Jersey, he has two younger brothers, Rich Baldinger, and Gary Baldinger, who also played in the NFL. He has a heavily mutilated right pinky finger that was injured when it became entangled in the facemask of Randy White.

Stallone worked two days and was paid $200. Shortly after the 1976 release of Rocky, The Party at Kitty and Stud's was edited and re-released as Italian Stallion to capitalize on its now-famous star. Plot The film deals with the sex life of a young New York City woman, Kitty, and her boyfriend, Stud. Stud is brutal and oafish but Kitty is enamored with his sexual performance. They sometimes engage in light sadomasochism, with Stud belt-whipping Kitty. Stud later posts a sign on a bulletin board inviting people to a party. Several people show up at Kitty and Stud's apartment and they engage in group sex, with Stud servicing all the women. Cast *Sylvester Stallone as Stud *Henrietta Holm as Kitty *Jodi Van Prang as Jodi *Nicholas Warren as Nick *Frank Micelli as Frank *Barbara Strom as Barb *Janet Banzet as Girl in Park (uncredited) Production =Development= According to Stallone, the film was financed by \\"a group of wealthy lawyers, very, very solid.\\" The actor said in a 1978 Playboy interview that he had done the film out of desperation after being bounced out of his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days, sleeping in a New York City bus station in the middle of winter. In Stallone's words: \\"It was either do that movie or rob someone because I was at the end‚Äîat the very end‚Äîof my rope. Instead of doing something desperate, I worked two days for $200 and got myself out of the bus station\\". The actor also called the film \\"horrendous\\" and commented \\"By today's standards, the movie would almost qualify for a PG rating\\". Release Although some sources, including Stallone himself, have stated that The Party at Kitty and Stud's was never released until after his success in Rocky (1976), contemporary newspaper advertisements indicate that the film was screened in adult cinemas in at least four U.S. states between 1970 and 1972.  Stallone has stated that after Rocky became a hit, the owners of The Party at Kitty and Stud's offered to sell him the rights to the film for about US$100,000 in order to prevent its re-release, but the actor \\"wouldn't buy it for two bucks\\". The film was then rereleased in theaters under the new title The Italian Stallion. In a prologue included with the reissued version, and in the film's trailer, pornography director Gail Palmer sat by an editing machine addressing the audience and presented the film as X-rated.. The release campaign implied that the original film was hardcore pornography, but that the material had now been edited into a milder version.Mondo Digital's Notes on Digital Sleaze However, the truth of this version has been repeatedly challenged, notably by trade journal AVN, which examined an original print, finding no trace of hardcore scenes. The \\"Sylvester Stallone porno movie\\" evolved over the years into a minor urban legend. In 2007, the film was released on DVD in a supposedly hardcore version with the lead actor performing actual sexual penetrations. However, the hardcore scenes in that version were revealed as inserts not involving Stallone. =Home media= The film was released on DVD in the United States in July 2004 by Ventura Distribution, then again in October 2007 by Cinema Epoch, both under short licenses from Bryanston Distributing Company. Bryanston owned all worldwide rights to the title and also granted short overseas licenses to various territories at the time.

One goal of the UTSA is to make the state laws governing trade secrets uniform, which is especially important for companies that operate in more than one state. Historically, the law governing misappropriation of trade secrets developed separately in each state. Of course, achieving the goal of uniformity depends upon the number of states that choose to adopt it. , the UTSA has been enacted by 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As with other Uniform Acts, some states have modified language in their version of the statute. Motivation A prefatory note to the UTSA states some original motivations for the act: The UTSA made note of the commercial value and competitive advantages inherent in trade secrets. Unlike patent protection, which was addressed at the federal level, trade secret misappropriation was addressed at the state level. In the United States there existed a prevalence of interstate commercial transactions that extended beyond the jurisdiction of individual state legislation. For example, goods may have been manufactured in State A, warehoused in State B, sold from State C, and delivered in State D. As a result, the UTSA sought to alleviate the uneven development and \\"uncertainty concerning the parameters of trade secret protection\\" by recommending a uniform trade secret law and, at the same time, allowing the states the flexibility to meet local circumstances by modifying the text as enacted in each state. In addition to providing some recourse for any uncertainty associated with a patent, the UTSA also serves to codify the common law remedies that have emerged in many states. These remedies are based on legal precedent set by previous cases, and therefore allow for greater uncertainty, particularly in less industrial states where there have been fewer trade secret cases. The UTSA notes that any confusion caused by having strictly common law remedies to trade secret misappropriation was exacerbated by omitting trade secret rules from the second edition of the Restatement of Torts. Overview The UTSA contained a prefatory note followed by 12 sections of proposed law. Each section was followed by a \\"comments\\" section that provided clarifications and examples as to the intent of the law. Section 1 presented definitions of key terms as they are used throughout the act. Sections 2‚Äì4 provided remedies for potential wrongs committed in violation of the act, including injunctive relief, damages and attorney's fees. Sections 5‚Äì12 made additional provisions related to the implementation of the law, and the relationship to other laws. =Key definitions= The UTSA provided several definitions of terms as they are used throughout the act. Some of these definitions are replicated here for the benefit of the reader. Although not included in the definition itself, the original text of the UTSA provided clarification regarding the definition of proper and improper means. The comments refined the definition by listing several proper means of discovery, including discovery by independent invention, reverse engineering, licensing arrangement, and published literature. The comments also clarified that improper means included actions that were, \\"improper under the circumstances; e.g., an airplane overflight used as aerial reconnaissance to determine the competitor's plant layout during construction of the plant\\". The UTSA noted that the types of accidents or mistakes that would lead to use of a learned trade secret being misappropriated did not include actions or mistakes that \\"constitute a failure of efforts that are reasonable under circumstances to maintain its [the trade secret's] secrecy\\". The UTSA also provided refinement through comments to the definition of a trade secret itself: *Multiple parties may hold rights to the same trade secret, as they may all individually derive value from it. *A trade secret ceases to exist when it is common knowledge within the community in which it is profitable. This means that the secret does not need to be known by the general public, but only throughout the industry that stands to profit from it. *A party that reverse engineers a trade secret may also obtain trade secret protection for their knowledge, provided the reverse engineering process is non-trivial. *Knowledge preventing loss of funds, such as that a particular idea does not work, is valuable and as such qualifies for trade secret protection. Regarding reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy, the UTSA maintained that actions such as restricting access to a \\"need-to-know basis\\" and informing employees that the information is secret met the criteria for reasonable efforts. The UTSA stated that the courts do not require procedures to protect against \\"flagrant industrial espionage\\" were not necessary. =Remedies= The UTSA provided for several potential remedies for wrongs committed under the act, including injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees. Injunctive relief Section 2 of the UTSA provided for injunctive relief from trade secret misappropriation. Section 2(a) stipulated, \\"Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined\\". However, the length of the injunction was limited to the length of time the trade secret exists (i.e., remains unknown to some party who could profit from knowing the secret) plus sufficient time to eliminate any competitive advantage that could have been obtained by misappropriation of the trade secret. In addition to the possible enjoinment described in section 2(a), section 2(b) allowed for the payment of reasonable royalties in place of an injunction under exceptional circumstances. The UTSA, in the comments for section 2, referenced a court case in which a misappropriated trade secret was used to build military technology for use during the Vietnam War. As an injunction may have prevented necessary equipment from reaching U.S. armed forces, the judge ordered that the misappropriator pay an appropriate royalty to the trade secret owner rather than imposing an injunction. Damages In addition to injunctive relief offered under the UTSA, parties may also receive damages. Section 3(a) states that, \\"Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss\\". Furthermore, the act stated in section 3(b) that if misappropriation is, \\"willful and malicious\\" the court may award damages up to twice what would otherwise be entitled under section 3(a). Restrictions similar to those imposed on the duration of injunctive relief are imposed on the duration of damages as well. Attorney's fees Section 4 of the UTSA stipulated that the court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party for actions made in \\"bad faith or willful and malicious misappropriation\\". =Other provisions= *Section 5 provided for the \\"preservation of secrecy\\"; namely that a court should take reasonable means to protect a trade secret during any legal action concerning the trade secret. These secretive measures can include sealing records and gag orders. *Section 6 provided a statute of limitations, requiring that any action under the UTSA must be \\"brought within 3 years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered\\". *Section 7 stated that the UTSA superseded any existing \\"... tort, restitutionary, and other law of this State providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret\\". The section also made clear that the UTSA did not affect (1) contractual remedies, (2) civil remedies not based on trade secret misappropriation, or (3) criminal remedies, which may otherwise be of use to the aggrieved party. *Section 8 stated the goal of making trade secret law uniform among states enacting the UTSA. *Section 9 provided a short title to refer to the act and section 10 described the severability of the act. *Sections 11 and 12 provided a date when the act took effect and the opportunity to explicitly list other acts to be repealed. Adoption by U.S. states , the UTSA has been adopted by all states except New York and North Carolina (but its law is very similar and seems to borrow heavily from the act ). On May 2, 2013, Texas enacted Senate Bill 953,S.B. 953, Texas, 2013 becoming the 47th state to adopt the UTSA. The Texas statute took effect on September 1, 2013.. Massachusetts adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act effective October 1, 2018. The UTSA has also been adopted in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.The following are links to the state codes of some of the states that have passed the UTSA: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey,Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming. States are not required to pass the act exactly as is, and some have made amendments. Notable cases The following cases have directly referenced the UTSA: *Rivendell Forest Prods. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp. (10th Cir. 1994) *Comprehensive Techs. Int'l v. Software Artisans, Inc.' (4th Cir. 1993) *DVD Copy Control Association v. Bunner (Cal. App. 1994) *Ajaxo v.

Phelan (4th Cir. 2008) *Southern Nuclear Operating Co. v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp. (11th Cir. 2008) International application Trade secret law varies more from country to country. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has provisions providing for uniform minimum standards for protecting trade secrets. Trade Secrets in Europe are dealt with on a country-by-country basis. In England and Wales, trade secret protection is predicated upon the common law concept of \\"breach of confidence\\"‚Äîi.e., regardless of the existence of a contract, those who obtain the trade secret in confidence shall not take unfair advantage of it without consent. Germany's Act Against Unfair Competition states, \\"any person who, in the course of business activity for purposes of competition, commits acts contrary to honest practices\\" and hold violators responsible for damages.

He was first in his class and president of the Harvard Law Review.\\"Goodwin, Richard\\" in John R. Burch Jr., The Great Society and the War on Poverty: An Economic Legacy in Essays and Documents (ABC-CLIO: 2017), p. 96-97. Career =Early career= After clerking for Justice Felix Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court, Goodwin became counsel for the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce where Goodwin was involved in investigating quiz show scandals, particularly the Twenty-One scandal.Jon Bradshaw, Richard Goodwin: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, New York (August 18, 1975). This affair provided the story for the 1994 movie Quiz Show, in which Goodwin was portrayed by actor Rob Morrow. =Kennedy administration= Goodwin joined the speechwriting staff of John F. Kennedy in 1959. Fellow Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen became a mentor to Goodwin. Goodwin was one of the youngest membersRichard N. Goodwin, White House Speech Writer, Dead at 86, Associated Press (May 21, 2018). of the group of \\"New Frontiersmen\\" who advised Kennedy; others included Fred Dutton, Ralph Dungan, Kenneth O'Donnell, and Harris Wofford, all of whom were under 37 years old.The New Frontiersmen: Profiles of the Men Around Kennedy (Public Affairs Press, 1961), p. ix. In 1961, after Kennedy became president, Goodwin became assistant special counsel to the President and a member of the Task Force on Latin American Affairs. Later that year, Kennedy appointed him Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs; Goodwin held this position until 1963. Goodwin reportedly opposed the Bay of Pigs invasion and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Kennedy not to order the operation. In August 1961, Goodwin was part of a delegation headed by US Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon that was sent to Uruguay to attend a conference of Latin American finance ministers.The next two paragraphs draw heavily on the account of this event documented in David Talbot's book Brothers as cited in the prior footnote. One result of the event, Goodwin's memo to Kennedy, is cited subsequently. The topic under discussion was the Alliance for Progress, which was endorsed by all countries representatives excepting Cuban representative Che Guevara. However, Guevara had no intentions of going home empty handed; he noticed that Goodwin smoked cigars during the meetings, and through an intermediary challenged him, suggesting he wouldn't dare smoke a Cuban cigar. Goodwin accepted the challenge, and subsequently, a gift of cigars in an elaborate polished mahogany box arrived from Guevara. Guevara expressed his desire to talk informally with Goodwin, and Goodwin received permission from Treasury Secretary Dillon. However, during the last day of the conference, Guevara had critical words for the press concerning the Alliance for Progress, and being the only representative to do so, speaking passionately on the topic, was upstaging the business-like, pin-striped, former-Wall-Street-banker Dillon. Dillon retracted his agreement for Guevara and Goodwin's meeting. However, Guevara persevered, and Goodwin agreed to listen, but he stressed that he had no real negotiating power. Later that evening at a party, Brazilian and Argentinian officials acted as intermediaries; Guevara and Goodwin were introduced, and went to a separate room so they could talk. Jokingly, Guevara \\"thanked\\" Goodwin for the Bay of Pigs invasion that had occurred only a few months earlier, as it had only solidified support for Castro. The ice was broken and the two idealists, both within a few years of 30 and sitting almost knee to knee, spoke through the night. Although they understood their countries were not destined to be friendly allies, they focused on what they could accomplish for the sake of peace. Ultimately, they came to the non- binding conclusion that if Cuba would be willing to desist from forming any military alliances with the USSR, nor try aid revolutionaries in other Latin American countries, America would be willing to stop trying to remove Castro by force and lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and vice versa. They agreed to reveal their conversation to only their respective leaders, Castro and Kennedy. Despite agreeing to detail to Castro what he discussed in their meeting, Guevara afterwards sent a letter to Goodwin behind Castro's back through one meeting participant referred to as \\"Daretta.\\" After returning from Uruguay, Goodwin wrote a memo for Kennedy on the meeting, where he stated how successful he was in convincing Guevara that he was a member of Guevara's \\"newer generation\\" and how Guevara also sent another message to Goodwin where he described their meeting \\"quite profitable.\\" Richard Goodwin. August 22, 1961. Memorandum for the President: \\"Conservation with Commandante Ernesto Guevara of Cuba\\", White House. While the meeting prompted a \\"minor political furor,\\" President Kennedy was ultimately satisfied with the outcome of Goodwin's efforts, and was the first to smoke one of the contraband Cuban cigars Goodwin had brought back. \\"'Are they good?' the president asked. 'They're the best,' Goodwin replied, prompting Kennedy to immediately open Guevara's gift and sample one of the Havanas.\\" Goodwin also did significant work in the Kennedy White House to relocate ancient Egyptian monuments that were threatened with destruction in the building of the Aswan Dam, including the Abu Simbel temples. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., in his book A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House, called Goodwin \\"the supreme generalist\\" who could: > \\"...turn from Latin America to saving the Nile Monuments, from civil rights > to planning a White House dinner for the Nobel Prize winners, from composing > a parody of Norman Mailer to drafting a piece of legislation, from lunching > with a Supreme Court Justice to dining with [actress] Jean Seberg ‚Äî and at > the same time retain an unquenchable spirit of sardonic liberalism and > unceasing drive to get things done.\\" Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, at the request of Jacqueline Kennedy, Goodwin arranged for an eternal flame to be placed at Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.Gus Russo & Harry Moses, Where Were You?: America Remembers the JFK Assassination (Lyons Press, 2013), p. 119.Vincent Bugliosi, Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy (W.W. Norton, 2007), p. 313. =Johnson administration= Goodwin in 1965 (left), with Bill Moyers and President Johnson in the Oval Office. From 1963 to 1964, Goodwin served as the secretary-general of the International Peace Corps Secretariat. In 1964, he became special assistant to the president in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Goodwin has been credited with naming Johnson's legislative agenda \\"the Great Society\\", a term first used by Johnson in a May 1964 speech. Although Goodwin contributed to a speech for Johnson outlining the program, Bill Moyers, another Johnson advisor, was the principal author of the speech.Steven F. Hayward, The Age of Reagan: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order: 1964-1980 (Three Rivers Press, 2001), p. 29. Goodwin wrote speeches for Johnson reacting to Bloody Sunday, the violent police suppression of civil rights marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge (1965) and calling for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Goodwin was also one of the writers of Robert F. Kennedy's Day of Affirmation Address (1966), the \\"ripple of hope\\" speech in which Kennedy denounced apartheid in South Africa. Goodwin was a key figure in the creation of the Alliance for Progress, a U.S. program to stimulate economic development in Latin America, and wrote a major speech for Johnson on the subject. =Career after government= In September 1965, Goodwin resigned from his White House position over his disillusionment with the Vietnam War. After his departure, Goodwin continued to write speeches for Johnson occasionally, the last being the 1966 State of the Union Address. In 1975, Time magazine reported that Goodwin had resigned after Johnson, who wanted to oust people close to Robert F. Kennedy from the White House, had asked FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to investigate him. The next year, Goodwin publicly joined the antiwar movement, publishing Triumph or Tragedy, a book critical of the war. He also published articles criticizing the Johnson administration's actions in Vietnam in The New Yorker under a pseudonym. After leaving government, Goodwin held teaching positions; he was a fellow at Wesleyan University's Center for Advanced Studies in Middletown, Connecticut, from 1965 to 1967 and was visiting professor of public affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968. In 1968, Goodwin was briefly involved in Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign, managing McCarthy's campaign in the New Hampshire primary, in which McCarthy won almost 42% of the vote, which was considered a moral victory over Johnson. Goodwin left McCarthy's campaign and worked for Senator Robert F. Kennedy after he entered the race. Goodwin served briefly as political editor of Rolling Stone in 1974.Philip Nobile, 'Rolling Stone' Tones Up, New York (January 26, 1981). He wrote a memoir, Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties (1988). In 2000, he contributed some lines to the concession speech Al Gore wrote with his chief speechwriter Eli Attie following the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v. Gore. His work was published in The New Yorker and he wrote numerous books, articles and plays. In 2003, the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford, England, produced his new work The Hinge of the World, which took as its subject matter the 17th-century conflict between Galileo Galilei and the Vatican. Retitled Two Men of Florence (referring to Galileo and his adversary Pope Urban VIII, who as Cardinal Maffeo Barberini had once been Galileo's mentor), the play made its American debut at the Huntington Theatre in Boston in March 2009. Awards and honors Goodwin received the Public Leadership Award from the Aspen Institute and the Distinguished American Award from the John F. Kennedy Library. Personal life Goodwin was married to Sandra Leverant from 1958 until her death in 1972. They had one son, Richard. In 1975, he married writer and historian Doris Kearns, with whom he had two children: Michael and Joseph. Goodwin died at his home in Concord, Massachusetts, on May 20, 2018, after a brief bout of cancer. He was 86 years old.

With her bow blown off, the wreck was used to create a new ship by joining the bow of another destroyer of the same class, . The resulting ship was given the portmanteau name . She went on to sink the U-boat in 1918 and was scrapped in 1919. Commissioning Nubian was launched on 20 April 1909, her keel plate having been laid down on 18 May 1908 at the Thornycroft yard in Woolston, Southampton. The ship was commissioned for service in the First Destroyer Flotilla by Commander Colin McKenzie at Sheerness on 3 September 1909. Powered by oil-fired steam turbines producing a total of around , she replaced a in the flotilla. Steam trials had taken place at the mouth of the Thames in June of that year. A long, four-funnelled, triple-screwed ship with a beam of , Nubian displaced slightly under 1,000 tons and had a crew of 70. She could sail at and had a pair of BL guns, one mounted at the fore and one aft, as well as two torpedo tubes. Movements The First Destroyer Flotilla was based at Harwich with the purpose of defending Britain's east coast. It was planned to include 12 ocean-going destroyers capable of 33 knots. Within a month of commissioning, Nubian had taken part in exercises at the Cromarty Firth with ships including , and . The flotilla was present at a gathering of the Royal Navy fleet near to Penzance in July 1910 and in September that year Nubian had her annual refit at Chatham Dockyard. In March 1911, she and other members of the flotilla moved from Harwich to Portland, while the Second Destroyer Flotilla moved away from there to Plymouth. She was at Kirkwall in May 1911 and took part in the huge naval review at Spithead in June. Nubian had a refit and basin trials of her machinery at Chatham in May 1912 before joining the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla at Portland for exercises in the English Channel. Together with fellow Fourth Destroyer Flotilla Tribal-class ships and Zulu, and the cruiser from the Second Squadron, Nubian sailed up the Manchester Ship Canal on 24 May that year to take part in a Whitsuntide display at the city. Most sources say that a smaller ship, Hope, was in attendance but some say that it was the battleship . Mooring at Trafford Wharf, members of the public were allowed to board the ships over three days. The visit coincided with Empire Day and generated much excitement, with 80,000 people visiting the docks on a single day and an estimated 100,000 being turned away due to overcrowding. Another refit took place at Chatham in September 1912 and it returned there in December. A visit to Sheerness with the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla followed prior to the group returning to its Portland base in January 1913. Nubian had come top of its class in the 1912 battle practice (long range firing under war conditions), scoring 102 points. Some of the flotilla, including Nubian, visited Bantry Bay and Queenstown in February 1913 during exercises. They returned to Sheerness and then to Chatham in March. The ship took part in further exercises later that year, at Fortrose and at Longhope, Orkney, before returning to Portland. In November, she acted as a tow for kites being used as targets in anti-aircraft gun tests at Needles Battery on the Isle of Wight, where her speed was remarked on. The Admiralty reported that she was among the top placed ships of that year's battle practice. By February 1914, Nubian and seven other Tribal-class destroyers were part of the Third Destroyer Flotilla but none were so for long. In May 1914, Nubian became a tender for the gunnery establishment . Nubian was among the ships that successfully hunted the German submarine in March 1915, although the fatal blows were delivered by Ghurka and . A month later, it was reported that she had been among many ships that participated in a bombardment of German positions on the coast of Belgium during October‚ÄìNovember 1914. Torpedoing and reconstruction HMS Zubian, formed from the remains of Nubian and HMS Zulu During the Battle of Dover Strait, on the night of 26‚Äì27 October 1916 off Folkestone Nubians bow was almost severed by a German torpedo that exploded almost under her bridge. She was taken in tow but the tow-ropes severed in the bad weather conditions and she ran aground on the South Foreland, near Dover. The bow then parted completely on a chalk reef and the remainder of the ship was driven under a cliff. Two of the crew of Nubian died and a further thirteen were missing, believed killed. Nubian was eventually refloated when a cutting was blasted through the rocks. Another Tribal-class destroyer, Zulu, had her stern blown off by a naval mine near Dunkirk on 8 November 1916 and was towed to Calais. Both wrecks were towed to Chatham Dockyard and Zulus bow was joined to the midsection and stern of Nubian. The resulting destroyer was given the portmanteau name Zubian. This ship served until the end of the war, sinking the mine-laying U-boat on 4 February 1918 off the coast of Essex. Fate Zubian was broken up at Sunderland in 1919.

The summit is at an elevation of .Google Earth The mountains of the Pambamarca in the Andean Highlands of Ecuador has many Pre- Columbian fortresses that predate the arrival of the Spanish in the region; Pambamarca has the greatest concentration of these forts. The Pambamarca Fortress Complex has been studied with participation by many international organizations, universities, and the Government of Ecuador with the objective of exploring the cultural landscapes, its prehistoric, historic and contemporary cultures, particularly of Ecuador‚Äôs important Pre-Columbian cultural heritage. In 1998, Pambamarca was placed on the tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\\"Tentative List of World Heritage Sites\\", http://www.unique-southamerica-travel-experience.com/unesco-world-heritage- centre-tentative-list.html, accessed 20 Oct 2017 History The fortifications originated with the Inca Empire who conquered Ecuador easily, and established themselves at Quito. Noting that the local indigenous community settled in Pambamarca were docile, the Incas thought that they could move in and occupy the territories outside Quito. But they faced serious resistance, and the war lasted 17 years before the Incas could finally conquer the Ecuadorians in the 1500s, with the fall of the fortresses. Following this, the Incas built many fortresses and lived in them. Among the provinces to the north of Quito the pre-Hispanic fortresses are concentrated in the mountain range of Pambamarca. Inferred from the Cayambe pottery in use in the region, archaeologist examining the area are of the opinion that Cayambe culture has prevailed \\"as some peoples decided after many years of resistance and warfare to simply lay down their arms or become allies with the Inca.\\" After Spanish people invaded Ecuador and Peru, not only smallpox took a big toll on the local population of Inca but due to the superior gunpowder power of the invaders their last stronghold at Vilcabamba also fell in 1572. After the Spanish conquest of Ecuador the Spaniards built estates known as haciendas. The Cayambe were subjected to forced labour in these estates, working on wool processing and living in primitive homes. Legend According to a legend that relates to the period, Huayna Capac, ruler of the Incas with an ambitious plan of winning the Cayambe got muddled in a 17 years' war even though they invaded with a large army. The Cayambes noted the large army of invaders had retreated to a large and strong fortress. When the Incas laid siege on the fort, the Cayambes‚Äô were not cowed but gave a brave fight which eventually forced the Incas to lift the siege as they had lost many men in the fight. However, the Incas finally defeated the Cayambes and forced them to retreat to the shores of the lake Yawarkucha. It is also said that the Incas cut the throats of their enemies and threw them into the lake, which turned red with blood, and thus the lake got the epithet \\"Yawarkucha\\" meaning \\"blood lake\\". This aspect of the legend is to be confirmed by further explorations by archeologists examining the areas. Geography Jorge Juan y Santacilia and Louis Godin, on their voyage through South America to fix signals for surveys, arrived at the \\"desert of Pambamarca\\" in early September 1737. A mountain of medium height in this desert is also named Pambarmarca. One of the largest group of fortresses (on the hill which is called locally as pukaras) seen in Ecuador was the Pambamarca Group located along a ridge running in a north‚Äìsouth direction. These military structures provided security to Quito fortress and other forts such as Jambimachi, Pambamarca, Pachha, Campana, Olachan Tablarumi, Achupallas, Guachala and Bravo. Cloudbow From the top of the Pambarmarca mountain, a strange weather phenomenon was noticed by Don Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa and several other climbers who had gone there to establish signal posts for surveys. As the cloud covered hills became clear of the clouds and frost with the Sun rising, each person on the hill top started noticing his own image at distance of about 10 miles opposite to the Sun. In this image, the head of each one of them appeared (individually) within the centre of three concentric irises (with colours coalescing with each other) as if each one, individually, was seeing his mirror image; these were perpendicular to the horizon. An arch in white colour was seen at a distance from the three irises, circumscribing them. The diameter of the central iris was initially measured as 5.5 degrees while the arch around the circles was 57 degrees in size. Initially, the arches were seen in oval shape and as the Sun rose above the horizon it changed to a perfect circular shape, like the disc of the Sun. The arches displayed red colour bordered by orange colour, followed by bright yellow becoming straw colour and finally into green. However, the outer arch was seen all through in red colour only. Similar arches were seen when the Moon was rising. Such a phenomenon was noticed by the survey team frequently on the mountains here. In the past, others had also observed this phenomenon and named it as the \\"frostbow\\" or \\"cloudbow\\" as the cloud vaporized with sun rise. They are also called it the White rainbows unlike the rainbows which formed after rains. Culture The Pambamarca Fortress Complex is a large installation of many Inca pucar√°s, located on the peaks and ridges of the extinct Pambamarca stratovolcano. During the current research by the Pambamarca Archaeological Project, the team uncovered pre-Inca fortresses at the base of Pambamarca. The existence of two types of forts and the recovery of many armaments is suggestive of a pre- Columbian borderland, which is an important and rare find in New World archaeology. Another culture of special importance, which attracted the Incas to this region is that the mountains are located on the equatorial line. It is the unique feature not replicated anywhere else in the world and forms the dividing line for the culture. The mounds found here have been used by the local Indians as landmarks for solar and star position calculations. Archeological finds The Incan Forts discovered in the Pambamarca extinct volcano region are 20, apart from two fortresses built by the Cayambe, the ethnic people of Ecuador. These fortresses have been identified as about 500 years old. According to the Director of the Archaeological Project these are inferred to represent border region between the fortresses built by the Ecuadorian people and the Inca. More fortresses are likely to be found in the entire northern region of Ecuador, which need further explorations. The Inca forts located at about elevation on ridges were built with stones laid over plinths called ushnus. Archeologists have inferred that these forts were inhabited and people living in them were ready for fighting with stone slings kept ready for use. The two Cayambe forts built with strong volcanic material known locally as cangahua are of large size which were inhabited. The forts were also well stocked with ammunition of two types-sling stones and bola stones.

He is the former chairman (2014‚Äì2019) and current vice-chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, and former chairman of the Democratic Party from 2006 to 2012. He is a solicitor and a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong for District Council (Second) constituency. Early life and education Ho was born in what was then British Hong Kong on 1 December 1951 in a big family with six children. His father worked in a shipping company by day and as a translator by night, along with two other jobs that he had. Ho got his Bachelor of Laws with honors in the University of Hong Kong in 1974, obtained Postgraduate Certificate in Laws in 1975. He attended lectures given by Hsu Kwan-san, a Chinese historian who later became a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, whom Ho cited his political belief and Chinese national sentiment were influenced by. During his college life, he developed his liberal ideals and actively involved in student politics and campaigned for Mak Hoi-wah who ran for the Hong Kong University Students' Union against the Maoist nationalists who dominated the student union in the 1970s. Legal and early political career Ho got admission to practice law in 1977 and appointed a notary public of the common law in 1988. He was employed for Messrs. C.Y. Kwan & Co. as a solicitor for nearly 20 years, then left to set up his own law firm, Ho, Tse, Wai & Partners. His litigation experience varied from banking cases and commercial law to land law and matrimonial disputes, as well as in criminal and medical negligence cases. Albert Ho worked a number of human rights cases on a pro bono (undertaken voluntarily and without payment) for the pan-democracy camp. Ho stepped into politics when he was first appointed to the Kowloon City District Board from 1982 to 1983. In 1985 he co-founded the Hong Kong Affairs Society (HKAS) to participate in the electoral politics during the transition period. During his spell as the leader of the HKAS, he demanded the faster pace of democratisation in Hong Kong and safeguarding the freedom and lifestyles after the handover of Hong Kong to Mainland China after 1997. In 1989, he co-founded the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China to support the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and critical of the Beijing government's bloody crackdown. He became the third chairman of the alliance since 2014, succeeding Lee Cheuk-yan. He ran for the Urban Council in Kowloon City West in the 1986 municipal election but was defeated by incumbent Peter Chan Chi-kwan. He ran again in the 1991 Urban Council election in Southern District but was again lost to incumbent Joseph Chan Yuet-sut of the conservative Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong. He was elected to the Regional Council in the municipal elections in 1995, receiving the largest number of votes in Regional Council. He kept served on the council through 1997 until it was abolished by then Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa in 2000. He had also been member of the Tuen Mun District Council for Lok Tsui since the 1999 District Council election. He had been targeted by the radical democrats, including Albert Chan of the People Power in the 2011 District Council election who opposed Democrats' compromise with the Beijing officials on the 2012 constitutional reform proposals and in the 2015 District Council election by Civic Passion's Cheng Chung-tai. He kept the seat for 15 years but was defeated in 2015 by pro-Beijing lawyer Junius Ho in 2015 by a narrow margin of 277 votes. Legislative Councillor In April 1990, Ho and other pro-democracy activists co-founded the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), the first major pro-democracy party in the city, in which he became the founding vice chairman. The party transformed into today's Democratic Party in 1994 where he was the member of the party's first executive committee. In 1992, he ran for the by-election in New Territories West as his first attempt to the Legislative Council after incumbent Democrat Ng Ming-yam died of cancer. He was defeated by conservative rural leader Tang Siu-tong by only four percent of the votes. He ran again in New Territories West in 1995 Legislative Council election, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote. He stepped down from the colonial legislature on 30 June 1997 on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong after the Beijing government dismantled the \\"through train\\" agreement of allowing the 1995 elected legislature to transition beyond 1997. The Democratic Party boycotted the Provisional Legislative Council controlled by Beijing and refused to take part in it. In November 1997, Ho was nominated by the Democratic Party to run for a seat in the National People's Congress, but excluded from competition when failed to obtain the minimum number of nominations from the 400-strong Beijing-appointed election conference. In the first Legislative Council election of the SAR period in 1998, Ho won a seat in the New Territories West with his party colleague Lee Wing-tat. With his strong basis in his strategic district Tuen Mun, he was re- elected in 2000 with one of the three Democratic Party tickets. Albert Chan who had strong basis in Tsuen Wan was also elected on the expense of Lee Wing- tat. Ho was re-elected in 2004. After the election, he unsuccessfully challenged Rita Fan in the Legco presidential election.

Billboard. He has collaborated with numerous artists, such as Nicki Minaj, 3T, T.I., Christina Aguilera, Jessie J, K. Michelle, Pharrell, DJ Cassidy, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Flo Rida, Brandy, Kid Cudi and Mary J. Blige. Thicke worked on albums such as Usher's Confessions and Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III, while releasing his own R&B; singles in the United States including \\"Lost Without U\\", \\"Magic\\", and \\"Sex Therapy\\". He gained international fame in 2013 with his single \\"Blurred Lines\\", which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. He is currently a judge on the Fox musical competition show The Masked Singer. He is a son of actress Gloria Loring and the late actor Alan Thicke. He married actress Paula Patton in 2005; in 2014, their separation and divorce were covered extensively by the tabloid press. Early life and career Thicke was born on March 10, 1977, in Los Angeles, California. His mother is American actress-singer Gloria Loring, who appeared on the NBC daytime drama Days of Our Lives, and his father was actor Alan Thicke (1947-2016), who is originally from Canada and was best known for his role on the TV sitcom Growing Pains. They divorced when Thicke was 7 years old. Thicke has an older brother, Brennan, who worked as a voice actor and voiced the titular character on the Dennis the Menace 1986 TV series, and a younger half-brother, Carter. Thicke also appeared in small roles on The Wonder Years, The New Lassie, Just the Ten of Us and several episodes of Growing Pains. Thicke's parents were supportive of his musical inclinations; his father helped him to write and structure his first songs. According to Thicke, his father would never pay for Thicke (then in his early teens) and his vocal group, As One, to record a professionally produced demo tape, wanting Robin to focus on his studies and graduate from school before committing to the pursuit of a career in music. The demo ultimately was paid for by jazz vocalist Al Jarreau, an uncle of one of the group members. Thicke's demo made its way to R&B; artist Brian McKnight, who was impressed enough by Thicke to invite him into the studio to work with him. Thicke was signed to McKnight's production company; \\"Anyway\\", a song co-written with Thicke, was featured on McKnight's second album I Remember You. Thicke's peers jokingly nicknamed him \\"Brian McWhite\\". It was Thicke's association with McKnight, who Thicke counts as one of his first mentors, that led him to his acquaintance with Jimmy Iovine and helped him to land his first recording contract with Interscope Records at the age of 16. Thicke later joined a hip hop duo with actor Brian Austin Green. Thicke moved out on his own at age 17, during his senior year of high school, earning a living and supporting himself as a professional record producer and songwriter. Thicke has noted that while his parents did not attempt to dissuade him from his desire to be in the music industry, their own experience with the nature of the entertainment business made them leery in the beginning. As Thicke's list of credits grew so did his parents' confidence in his decision. While initially signed as a singer and artist in his own right, Thicke first made a name for himself within the industry as a songwriter and producer for other artists before releasing and performing his own music. Among his work for other artists, Thicke co-wrote \\"Love Is on My Side\\" on Brandy's eponymous debut album; he also wrote for 3T's Brotherhood, and collaborated with Jordan Knight, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on several songs in Knight's 1999 album Jordan Knight including the Billboard top 10 hit \\"Give It to You\\". According to Thicke, Knight also invested in the ability of the young songwriter early on by purchasing studio equipment for him. He also co-wrote the song \\"When You Put Your Hands on Me\\" for Christina Aguilera's debut album and co-wrote and produced three songs for M√Ωa's sophomore release, Fear of Flying. In 1999, Thicke co-wrote the song \\"Fall Again\\" with Walter Afanasieff, which was intended to be a track on Michael Jackson's 2001 album Invincible, but it failed to be presented as a completed song. The demo Michael recorded in 1999 was released on November 16, 2004, as an album track of his limited edition box set The Ultimate Collection. As an artist, he recorded and performed solely under his surname, Thicke. He would continue to do so until 2005. Career =1999‚Äì2003: A Beautiful World and early success= At the age of 22, after an involvement with Tommy Mottola and Epic Records following the end of his first deal with Interscope, Thicke resolved himself to work chiefly on material for his debut album, initially titled Cherry Blue Skies, planning to use his own money to fund the project. As Thicke told Billboard, \\"I decided I was going to save money to make my album, and I hoped to offer it to labels‚Äìtake it or leave it‚Äìso I didn't have to negotiate how to make my music.\\" While piecing his album together, Thicke began working with veteran producer and label executive Andre Harrell and, under his guidance, eventually signed with Interscope for a second time as part of Harrell's and Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds' Nu America imprint label in 2001. In 2002, Thicke released his debut single \\"When I Get You Alone\\". The track samples Walter Murphy's \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\", which itself is a disco rendition of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The music video for the song received some rotation on MTV2 and BET's Rated Next and was spun moderately on pop and urban radio, peaking at number 49 on Radio & Records Pop chart. Globally, however, \\"When I Get You Alone\\" became a chart success when it peaked in the Top 20 in Australia, Belgium, and Italy, and reached the Top 10 of the singles charts in New Zealand and the Top 3 in the Netherlands. The moderate success was enough to signal the release of the album in 2003 with its name changed to A Beautiful World. Despite the release of a second single, \\"Brand New Jones\\", the album received very little promotion and debuted at number 152 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 119,000 copies as of January, 2012. A Beautiful World fell below the label's commercial expectations. The album's under-performance troubled Thicke personally, but it proved enough to make him a wanted collaborator. Thicke has cited Mary J. Blige, Usher, and Lil' Wayne, among others, as those who subsequently reached out to him. Reflecting on A Beautiful World in 2013, Usher stated to The New York Times, \\"I was blown away ‚Äî I thought Beatles, Earth Wind & Fire, Shuggie Otis, Marvin Gaye ‚Äî all in one album. [Robin's] got a soul you can't buy, man.\\" Runner-up Blake Lewis performed \\"When I Get You Alone\\" during the 2007 season of American Idol when the Top 3 chose a song to sing. Lewis has often put Robin Thicke in his list of musical influences in interviews and on the American Idol website. The song was also performed by Blaine Anderson (played by Darren Criss) on Glee during the Season 2 episode \\"Silly Love Songs\\". =2004‚Äì07: The Evolution of Robin Thicke and commercial breakthrough= Following A Beautiful World, Thicke was keen to begin work on his sophomore album but financial and creative disagreements stemming from the performance of his first album led to a several month-long stalemate between Robin and his record label. Regarding this time in his career, Thicke said,\\"The label pretty much lost faith in my ability to sell. It became a question of, 'Where does he fit? Is he not rock or pop enough? Is he not soul enough?'\\" Pharrell Williams, having established a distribution deal with Interscope for his record label, Star Trak, expressed to Jimmy Iovine his interest in Thicke, whose talent he thought of highly. Signed to Star Trak in 2005, Thicke continued work on his second album, The Evolution of Robin Thicke. The first single, \\"Wanna Love U Girl\\", featured producer Williams and charted successfully on urban radio in the United Kingdom. In 2006, a remix version of the song was filmed with rapper Busta Rhymes. Nearly a year after the single was released, the album was released on October 3, 2006. To promote the album, Thicke toured with India.Arie and then opened for John Legend in late 2006. The video for his second single, the ballad \\"Lost Without U\\", was released in fall 2006. The song began appearing on Billboard R&B; charts in November of that year. With the assistance of radio airplay, the song became his breakout hit, reaching number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spending 11 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, making him the first white male artist to top that chart since George Michael did so in 1988 with \\"One More Try\\". In the February 24, 2007 issue of Billboard, Thicke concurrently topped four Billboard charts: Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums, Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Airplay, and Adult R&B; Songs, a feat he would duplicate in the March 17 issue. Following its re-release as a Deluxe Edition (with three new bonus tracks) on February 13, 2007, the album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200. On March 23, 2007, The Evolution of Robin Thicke was certified Platinum by the RIAA. With album sales of over 1.5 million copies sold domestically, The Evolution of Robin Thicke became a commercial success in the United States. Thicke and his record label Interscope soon considered potential tracks to be released as the album's next and third single. Thicke's preference was the track \\"Can U Believe\\", which peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. On October 2, 2007, the track \\"Got 2 Be Down\\" was released as the album's fourth official single. The single peaked at number 60 on Billboard's Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. On April 19, 2007, Thicke performed on The Oprah Winfrey Show, singing \\"Lost Without U\\". He returned to the show a month later, on May 29, performing \\"Complicated\\" and Oprah's favorite song from the album, \\"Would That Make U Love Me\\", while also promoting Beyonc√©'s tour, on which he would be an opening act. Oprah revealed that Thicke's initial appearance garnered a strong reaction, noting that people called the show to say that they didn't know he would be on. Oprah explained, \\"So what I wanted to do was to accommodate all of the people who missed it the first time ... In order to do that, I had to do something I've never done before. I got on the phone and asked this very special guest if he would consider coming back.\\" In late 2007, Thicke finished promotion for the album as the featured opening act for the North American leg of Beyonc√©'s US tour, The Beyonc√© Experience. Other notable performances in support of the album and its single \\"Lost Without U\\" include the 2007 BET Awards, The 2007 MOBO Awards, American Idol, and the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards. He also performed a one-off UK concert at KOKO in London on September 24, 2007. =2008‚Äì2010: Something Else and Sex Therapy= Thicke released his third solo album, titled Something Else, on September 30, 2008. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 charts and sold 137,000 copies in the first week. The first single from the album, \\"Magic\\", was a further expansion of the R&B; sound that powered his 2006 breakthrough, The Evolution of Robin Thicke. \\"Magic\\" went on to peak at number two on the Adult R&B; chart, number six on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop chart and number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He followed this success with the second single, \\"The Sweetest Love\\", which peaked at number two on the Adult R&B; chart and number 20 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop chart. On February 8, 2009, at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, Thicke took the stage alongside Lil' Wayne to perform their song \\"Tie My Hands\\" from the Grammy-winning album Tha Carter III (the song was also featured on Something Else) which was followed by Thicke and Lil' Wayne participating in a medley of \\"Big Chief\\" and \\"My Feet Can't Fail Me Now\\" led by jazz musicians Allen Toussaint, Terence Blanchard, and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band in tribute to New Orleans and the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Thicke appeared on an episode of ABC's The Bachelor to perform \\"Magic\\" and \\"The Sweetest Love\\" for the remaining female contestants. Thicke wrote and produced a track for the movie Precious in which his wife Paula Patton also starred, though it did not appear on the soundtrack and remains unreleased. He co-headlined a U.S. tour with Jennifer Hudson, which began March 31, 2009 in Albany, New York, and wrapped up 25 shows later in Biloxi, Mississippi. At the start of the tour, Thicke released \\"Dreamworld\\" as the official third single from Something Else. As of April 2009, Something Else has shifted over 435,000 units in the U.S. Seven months after the release of Something Else, Billboard.com announced that Thicke would release his fourth studio album in the fall of 2009, his first to not be mainly self-produced. The album, titled Sex Therapy, had its release date postponed to winter, on December 15, 2009. The first single from the album was the title track, produced by Polow Da Don, which in March 2010 became Thicke's second song to top the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The lead single for international markets was \\"Rollacosta\\" featuring singer Estelle. The second U.S. single was \\"It's in the Mornin'\\" featuring Snoop Dogg. \\"Shakin' It for Daddy\\", featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, produced by Polow Da Don, was supposed to be released as a single at some point, however, its release was eventually canceled. Speaking of the musical background to Sex Therapy, Thicke told Pete Lewis ‚Äì Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul ‚Äì \\"I'm always gonna have the influence of Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green in my music. But with this album I also wanted to show my hip hop side. I grew up listening to Run-DMC and N.W.A and Biggie and Pac and Jay-Z ... So I really wanted to make a record that represented how much that music has influenced me.\\" Earlier in 2009, on October 14, Leighton Meester's debut single \\"Somebody to Love\\", featuring Thicke, was released.

I've realized as I've gotten older that we all think we're living either in a black or white world, or on a straight path, but most of us are living right in between those straight lines. And everything you thought you knew, the older you get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I think that, that's what I've been realizing these past few years.\\" The singer also explained his foray into a more poppy sound than his usual milieu. \\"The last year I've been wanting to have more fun. I think I took myself very seriously as an artist and I wanted to be like Marvin Gaye, and John Lennon and Bob Marley and these great artists and songwriters that sang about love and sang about relationships,\\" Robin explained. \\"And then the last year, my wife and I just really wanted to have fun again, we wanted to be young again and we wanted to dance again and go out with our friends, so I wanted to make music that reflected that culture also.\\" The song has been a worldwide hit, has peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and has also reached number one in 13 more countries including the United Kingdom, where Blurred Lines became only the 137th record in history to surpass the one million sales mark, and the United States.

I've always respected women.\\" In response to Thicke's statement in GQ that the idea of the video was to be 'derogatory towards women', the director Diane Martel denied this was discussed on set: \\"That's crazy.

In a 2015 interview with Jody Rosen of The New York Times, Thicke expressed both embarrassment over his public dedications and regret over giving the album a commercial release, stating, \\"my record company didn't want me to put it out, but they stuck by me. In hindsight, the only thing I would have done differently was, I wouldn't have promoted it or sold it. I would have given it away.\\" Following the release of Paula, Thicke spent several months largely away from media appearances and performing in order to focus on his personal life and to work on new music. Thicke returned to the spotlight at the BET Awards 2015 to sing the classic Smokey Robinson and The Miracles hit \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\" in tribute to Lifetime Achievement Award recipient Smokey Robinson and joined Robinson on stage for a group rendition of \\"My Girl\\" alongside Tori Kelly and Ne-Yo. On June 29, on the heels of his BET Awards performance, Thicke debuted the lyric video for his new single \\"Morning Sun\\", on Vevo followed by the official release of the single on June 30. \\"Morning Sun\\" rose to the number 4 position on the Billboard Adult R&B; Songs chart becoming Thicke's 11th top 10 hit on Urban AC radio. Speaking with Prestige Hong Kong, Thicke explained: \\"The new album is call[ed] Morning Sun. It's about fresh starts, new beginnings, and the heralding in of a new day. It's about the last year of my life, the time I've spent with my friends and family and especially my son.\\" Thicke also spoke of working again with Pharrell and Timbaland as well as with new collaborators DJ Mustard, Max Martin, and Ricky Reed. Another new single \\"Back Together\\", featuring Nicki Minaj, was released on August 6, 2015. Thicke rejoined the cast of Real Husbands of Hollywood in 2016 for its fifth season. In the premiere episode, Thicke parodied his publicized personal and professional troubles including his divorce, lawsuit, drug use and poorly received album. In January 2019, Thicke began appearing as a panelist on the reality competition series The Masked Singer. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Robin Thicke among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire. Artistry =Influences= Thicke is a self-taught pianist. Some of the first songs he learned to play and sing along with as a child were by gospel artists such as Commissioned, Take 6, and John P. Kee, studying their licks and harmonies. Thicke has drawn influence from a variety of artists including James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Sting, Prince, Alanis Morissette, The Beatles, John Lennon, Bob Marley and Michael Jackson. Thicke has said that he considers himself a soulful singer but does not like his music being described as \\"blue-eyed soul\\", finding the term too pigeonholing.Miller, Mitzi (November 2008), \\"on the record with ... ROBIN THICKE\\". Essence. 39 (7):66 =Songwriting and producing= Thicke began his career by writing and producing songs for popular artists. He co-wrote and produced the Color Me Badd song \\"Sexual Capacity\\" in 1996. He also co-wrote on the self-titled debut album by Christina Aguilera, which sold 17 million copies worldwide. Albums on which Thicke's songwriting, producing, and other contributions have been featured include: Brandy, Brian Mcknight's I Remember You, Brownstone's Still Climbing, Jordan Knight, Chante Moore's This Moment Is Mine, Marc Anthony, P!nk's Can't Take Me Home, Ronan Keating's Ronan, M√Ωa's Fear of Flying, BBMak's Sooner or Later, both Will Young's Friday's Child and Keep On. The Thicke original \\"When I Get You Alone\\" was performed by Guy Sebastian, the winner of the first Australian Idol 2003, during the competition and at the Idol grand finale. \\"When I Get You Alone\\" was a popular song choice for Sebastian; he put the live idol performance on his four-times platinum debut single \\"Angels Brought Me Here\\"; it was the fastest selling single in Australia debuting at number one and immediately breaking an ARIA record. In 2004, Thicke co-wrote and produced \\"Out With My Baby\\" with Guy Sebastian, along with being credited for work on two additional songs from Sebastian's second album, Beautiful Life. The single, \\"Out With My Baby\\", became a platinum selling #1 hit for Sebastian on the ARIA Singles Charts. During this same year, he co-wrote and produced a song with the singer and actress Raven-Symon√© for the album This Is My Time, with the song \\"Set Me Free\\". Thicke co-wrote \\"Can U Handle It?\\" for Usher's 2004 album, Confessions, with backing vocals provided by Paula Patton. Confessions would go on to sell 20 million copies worldwide and win the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B; Album in 2005. Thicke co-wrote and produced the song \\"Tie My Hands\\" on Lil' Wayne's multi-platinum selling album Tha Carter III which went on to win Best Rap Album. Thicke wrote and produced the song \\"Giving Myself\\" for Jennifer Hudson's eponymous debut album, which went on to win Best R&B; Album. In total, albums on which Thicke has been credited for his work (in capacities including writer, producer, arranger, vocalist, and musician) have sold over 60 million copies worldwide. Throughout his career, Thicke has worked most frequently with long-time production partner Pro Jay (James Gass), whose contributions have appeared on all of Thicke's own studio albums and whose name can be found alongside Thicke's in writing and producing credits for other artists. Thicke also often enlists veteran session guitarist and songwriter Bobby Keyes as well as keyboardist and music director Larry Cox to contribute to his projects. =Collaborations= In 2005, Thicke performed as a guest on the remix of Will Smith's song \\"Switch\\". In 2007, Thicke appeared on 50 Cent's album Curtis on a song called \\"Follow My Lead\\". The following year, he worked with Ashanti on her fourth studio album, The Declaration. Thicke also appeared on R. Kelly's Untitled on the track \\"Pregnant\\" which also features Tyrese and The-Dream. In 2008, Thicke was enlisted by producer Polow da Don to play piano on the hit Usher track \\"Love in This Club\\", which reached the #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100.Jane√© Bolden (April 4, 2008).

Thicke was featured along with a number of his contemporaries on the 2010 release Q Soul Bossa Nostra, an album in tribute to famed composer and music producer Quincy Jones (who also executive produced the project), which consisted of reinterpretations of Jones' work. In 2014, Thicke joined Jessie J on the DJ Cassidy produced song \\"Calling All Hearts\\". Thicke was featured along with bassist Verdine White on Flo Rida's \\"I Don't Like It, I Love It\\" in 2015 which found success on several international charts and peaked among the top 10 singles in seven countries. Personal life At age 14, Robin Thicke first met actress Paula Patton, who was then 16, in 1991 at an under-21 hip- hop club called Balistyx (co-founded and co-hosted by David Faustino) on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, when he asked her to dance. They were married in 2005 and their son Julian Fuego was born on April 7, 2010. Thicke and Patton separated in February 2014, after 21 years together and almost nine years of marriage. On October 9, 2014, Patton officially filed for divorce due to his infidelity, alleged abuse, and drug use. The divorce was finalized on March 20, 2015. In 2014, Thicke met April Love Geary at a party. They first appeared in public together in 2015. On February 22, 2018, Geary gave birth to their daughter Mia Love Thicke. In August 2018, Geary announced that the couple was expecting their second child; they became engaged on Christmas Eve 2018 and welcomed second daughter Lola Alain Thicke on February 26, 2019. In October 2020, the couple announced they were expecting their third child for December. Thicke is a close friend of fellow performer Usher. Thicke was present for Usher's engagement to Tameka Foster, serenading the couple with his song \\"The Stupid Things\\" as Usher proposed among family and friends. On November 10, 2018, Geary revealed in an Instagram story she and Thicke had lost their Malibu home to the Woolsey wildfire that had been consuming the area. Two days later, Thicke returned to his property, describing the totality of the fire in a video for Entertainment Tonight: \\"It's funny, [from what] you see in movies, you'd think there would be one doll left over, or a book of course, something. [But] it's just rubble.

It begins at U.S. Route 69 (US 69) south of Cameron, where it begins travelling eastward. The road intersects a county route and crosses over two streams. The route ends at the Wallace State Park entrance, where the road becomes Route HH after the intersection. The route was opened around 1936, serving as the connector between US 69 and the state park. The road cost $18,000 to build in 1935, and it allowed federal construction to begin at the park. Route description Route 121 at Route HH All of the route is located in Clinton County. Route 121 begins at a T-intersection at US 69, south of Cameron and US 69's interchange with Interstate 35 near the city. The route travels eastwards over Christman Brook, and it enters a mixture of farmland and forests. The road intersects Northeast Jones Road, which is concurrent with the route for . Route 121 shifts north temporarily, and it intersects Northeast Jones Road, the end of the concurrency. The road then borders Hawn State Park and crosses over Deer Creek. Travelling through a forest, the route turns southeastward near the park entrance. Route 121 ends at a Y-intersection with the park entrance and Route HH, a supplemental route. The road continues eastward as Route HH, which ends at Route 13 in Kingston. Route 121 is designated as a major collector route by the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDot). In 2016, MoDOT calculated 627 vehicles, including 32 trucks travelling on Route 121 east of US 69. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. Although the route travels in an east‚Äìwest fashion, MoDot has designated it as a north‚Äìsouth route. History In October 1935, the Missouri State Highway Commission announced a project to construct Route 121AP from US 69 to Wallace State Park. The project included grading of the route, culverts, bridges, and gravel pavement. The projected route was long. Gerard Knutson of Kansas City received the contract for the project, with the lowest bid of $20,614 (). Approval of the project was given by Franklin D. Roosevelt by October 31, with a new price of $18,000 (). Construction started on November 25, by the Joe Pohl Construction Company. Workers were employed one week before construction, allocated to building the bridge near the park. The project allowed federal work to start for the park, and the finished road was reflected in the 1936 state map as Route 121. The route was paved in asphalt by 1949.

An accelerometer at rest in a non-inertial frame will, in general, detect a non-zero acceleration. While the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames, in non-inertial frames, they vary from frame to frame depending on the acceleration. In classical mechanics it is often possible to explain the motion of bodies in non-inertial reference frames by introducing additional fictitious forces (also called inertial forces, pseudo-forces and d'Alembert forces) to Newton's second law. Common examples of this include the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. In general, the expression for any fictitious force can be derived from the acceleration of the non-inertial frame. As stated by Goodman and Warner, \\"One might say that F ma holds in any coordinate system provided the term 'force' is redefined to include the so-called 'reversed effective forces' or 'inertia forces'.\\" In the theory of general relativity, the curvature of spacetime causes frames to be locally inertial, but globally non-inertial. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of curved space-time, there are no global inertial reference frames in general relativity. More specifically, the fictitious force which appears in general relativity is the force of gravity. Avoiding fictitious forces in calculations In flat spacetime, the use of non-inertial frames can be avoided if desired. Measurements with respect to non-inertial reference frames can always be transformed to an inertial frame, incorporating directly the acceleration of the non-inertial frame as that acceleration as seen from the inertial frame. This approach avoids use of fictitious forces (it is based on an inertial frame, where fictitious forces are absent, by definition) but it may be less convenient from an intuitive, observational, and even a calculational viewpoint.‚ÄúThe inertial frame equations have to account for VŒ© and this very large centripetal force explicitly, and yet our interest is almost always the small relative motion of the atmosphere and ocean, V' , since it is the relative motion that transports heat and mass over the Earth. ‚Ä¶ To say it a little differently‚Äîit is the relative velocity that we measure when [we] observe from Earth‚Äôs surface, and it is the relative velocity that we seek for most any practical purposes.‚Äù MIT essays by James F. Price, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (2006). See in particular ¬ß4.3, p. 34 in the Coriolis lecture As pointed out by Ryder for the case of rotating frames as used in meteorology: Detection of a non-inertial frame: need for fictitious forces That a given frame is non-inertial can be detected by its need for fictitious forces to explain observed motions. For example, the rotation of the Earth can be observed using a Foucault pendulum. The rotation of the Earth seemingly causes the pendulum to change its plane of oscillation because the surroundings of the pendulum move with the Earth. As seen from an Earth-bound (non-inertial) frame of reference, the explanation of this apparent change in orientation requires the introduction of the fictitious Coriolis force. Another famous example is that of the tension in the string between two spheres rotating about each other. In that case, prediction of the measured tension in the string based upon the motion of the spheres as observed from a rotating reference frame requires the rotating observers to introduce a fictitious centrifugal force. In this connection, it may be noted that a change in coordinate system, for example, from Cartesian to polar, if implemented without any change in relative motion, does not cause the appearance of fictitious forces, despite the fact that the form of the laws of motion varies from one type of curvilinear coordinate system to another. Fictitious forces in curvilinear coordinates A different use of the term \\"fictitious force\\" often is used in curvilinear coordinates, particularly polar coordinates. To avoid confusion, this distracting ambiguity in terminologies is pointed out here. These so-called \\"forces\\" are non-zero in all frames of reference, inertial or non-inertial, and do not transform as vectors under rotations and translations of the coordinates (as all Newtonian forces do, fictitious or otherwise). This incompatible use of the term \\"fictitious force\\" is unrelated to non-inertial frames. These so-called \\"forces\\" are defined by determining the acceleration of a particle within the curvilinear coordinate system, and then separating the simple double-time derivatives of coordinates from the remaining terms. These remaining terms then are called \\"fictitious forces\\". More careful usage calls these terms \\" _generalized_ fictitious forces\\" to indicate their connection to the generalized coordinates of Lagrangian mechanics. The application of Lagrangian methods to polar coordinates can be found here. Relativistic point of view =Frames and flat spacetime= If a region of spacetime is declared to be Euclidean, and effectively free from obvious gravitational fields, then if an accelerated coordinate system is overlaid onto the same region, it can be said that a uniform fictitious field exists in the accelerated frame (we reserve the word gravitational for the case in which a mass is involved). An object accelerated to be stationary in the accelerated frame will \\"feel\\" the presence of the field, and they will also be able to see environmental matter with inertial states of motion (stars, galaxies, etc.) to be apparently falling \\"downwards\\" in the field along curved trajectories as if the field is real. In frame-based descriptions, this supposed field can be made to appear or disappear by switching between \\"accelerated\\" and \\"inertial\\" coordinate systems. =More advanced descriptions= As the situation is modeled in finer detail, using the general principle of relativity, the concept of a frame- dependent gravitational field becomes less realistic. In these Machian models, the accelerated body can agree that the apparent gravitational field is associated with the motion of the background matter, but can also claim that the motion of the material as if there is a gravitational field, causes the gravitational field - the accelerating background matter \\"drags light\\". Similarly, a background observer can argue that the forced acceleration of the mass causes an apparent gravitational field in the region between it and the environmental material (the accelerated mass also \\"drags light\\"). This \\"mutual\\" effect, and the ability of an accelerated mass to warp lightbeam geometry and lightbeam-based coordinate systems, is referred to as frame- dragging. Frame-dragging removes the usual distinction between accelerated frames (which show gravitational effects) and inertial frames (where the geometry is supposedly free from gravitational fields). When a forcibly- accelerated body physically \\"drags\\" a coordinate system, the problem becomes an exercise in warped spacetime for all observers.

About 17,500 people can occupy the venue; there are 7,000 seats and the grass area can hold about 10,500 people. Concerts are from May through September featuring 45-50 different events of many types of musical styles. It is ranked among the top five most successful amphitheatres in the country. It is one of two major outdoor arenas in the New York City Metropolitan Area, along with Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater. Like the Northwell Health theater, the PNC Bank Arts Center is managed by Live Nation. History The amphitheatre was originally called the Garden State Arts Center. The 1954 legislation that created the Garden State Parkway (at whose Exit 116 the Arts Center is located) also called for recreational facilities along the Parkway's route, and in 1964 Holmdel's Telegraph Hill was chosen as the site for \\"a cultural and recreational center ... that would be developed as a center for music and the performing arts.\\" The amphitheatre was designed by noted modernist architect Edward Durell Stone and featured open sides covered by a , saucer-like roof supported by eight large concrete pillars. It featured seating for 5,197 people with space for about 5,000 more on the lawn area outside the roof.Garden State Arts Center The facility is most easily accessible from the Parkway. The Garden State Arts Center opened on June 12, 1968, with a program featuring pianist Van Cliburn, conductor Eugene Ormandy, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Arts Center was operated in conjunction with the New Jersey Highway Authority, which also ran the Parkway. On June 25 and 26, 1968, Judy Garland performed at this facility. In the beginning, the Arts Center's programming featured a good deal of classical as well as popular music. In addition, a number of free daytime programs were provided for schoolchildren, senior citizens, and the disadvantaged and disabled. Beginning in 1971, the non-profit Foundation associated with the Arts Center also sponsored International Heritage Festivals before and after the regular season focusing on ethnicities such as Scottish, Slovak, German, Polish, African American, etc.; due to lack of attendance, these festivals were discontinued in 2015. During off-season months the Arts Center is generally unused, except for a Holiday Light Spectacular show during the Christmas season. A banquet hall is on premises but has not been occupied since 2013. In 1995, the Arts Center grounds saw the addition of the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. During the 1990s the philosophy of the Arts Center underwent a change. Classical music was almost completely phased out, and the venue's management wanted to expand the venue to compete against other, larger amphitheatres on the summer outdoor concert circuit. Before the 1996 season, a substantial expansion added 2,000 seats (some now outside the roof, which was not altered) and doubled the lawn capacity by removing rows of trees and a surrounding walk and raising the bank around the facility much higher. =Renaming and expansion= In 1996, PNC Bank, a Pittsburgh-based banking company, purchased naming rights and the venue was renamed the PNC Bank Arts Center, for $8.5 million over a 10-year period. In 1998, as a result of the name change, and despite negotiations to keep the words \\"Garden State\\" in the new name, state Senators Joe Kyrillos and John Bennett introduced and passed legislation to remove all state funds from any PNC Bank accounts and redeposit them in other banks within the state. A variety of corporations provide services to the PNC Bank Arts Center including: Live Nation, New Jersey State Police, 503 Safety Consultants, Quality Medical Transport, Control, Legends Hospitality, and more. Prior to the 2017 season, the security was provided by USI/Strikeforce, but Live Nation made the decision to bring security \\"in house\\" beginning in 2017. Prior to the 2018 season, emergency medical services were provided by MONOC EMS, but the decision was made to hire 503 Safety Consultants; a firm owned by MONOC's previous Operations Director to manage the high-profile emergency medical services. Ambulance transportation is now provided by Quality Medical Transport, in partnership with 503 Safety Consulting. Holiday Light Spectacular PNC Bank Arts Center features one of the most extravagant drive through light displays in the tri-state area. The spectacular is a drive through a forest of lights. Over 5 million lights were used over 225 displays and usually runs from the end of November through January 2. The display is set up in the parking lot around the Arts Center on a specially prepared road. In the premises of the light spectacular, a radio station plays Christmas carols as well as a Winter Village at the end of the display which features a snack bar, ice rink, and a Christmas decoration shop which sells smaller replicas of the displays in the light spectacular. Some large displays which are not visible from the parking lot or the amphitheater are left at their respective spots permanently. In 2008, it was announced the display would be discontinued, however, after a 7-year hiatus, the display returned for the 2014-2015 holiday season. Performers and performances Perhaps the most popular performer, over the years, has been James Taylor, who appears there almost every year and who has been one of the few acts to be booked there three nights in a row. Ironically, Bruce Springsteen, New Jersey's most famous musician and New Jerseyan, had never appeared (save for a 1989 walk-on, during a Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band show), until two performances in 2006, during the Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour and joining Beach Boy Brian Wilson for \\"Barbara Ann\\" and \\"Surfing U.S.A.\\" on July 1, 2015. The Spice Girls performed to a sold-out crowd as part of their Spiceworld Tour on June 25, 1998. New Jersey's own Jonas Brothers did shows there on August 16, 2008 August 16 and 17 2010 and July 25, 2013. Glen Campbell recorded his album, entitled Glen Campbell Live, on July 4, 1969, for Capitol Records. The album went to #2 on the Billboard Country Albums list and #13 on Billboard 200. The following year, Dionne Warwick hit #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 with a version of \\"Make It Easy on Yourself\\" recorded at the venue. Portions of Jackson Browne's landmark 1977 live album, entitled Running on Empty, were recorded here. The Allman Brothers Band performed and recorded their show, on August 16, 1994, which a portion was later included on their live album, entitled An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: 2nd Set. Sting performed during his Symphonicities Tour on July 7, 2010, along with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The amphitheatre has played host to music festivals, including The Area Festival, Cr√ºe Fest, Cr√ºe Fest 2, The Gigantour, Lilith Fair, The Mayhem Festival, Ozzfest, Projekt Revolution, The Uproar Festival and The Vans Warped Tour. =Sin√©ad O'Connor controversy= Sin√©ad O'Connor was scheduled to perform on August 24, 1990. The practice of the venue is to play a recording of the American national anthem prior to the beginning of a featured show. O'Connor, who said she was unaware of this practice until shortly before the show was to begin, refused to go on if the anthem was played. Venue officials acquiesced to her demand and omitted the anthem, and so O'Connor performed, but later permanently banned her. O'Connor said that she had a policy of not having the national anthem of any country played before her concerts and meant \\"no disrespect\\" but that she \\"will not go on stage after the national anthem of a country which imposes censorship on artists. It's hypocritical and racist.\\" The incident made tabloid headlines and O'Connor received considerable criticism, including an embargo of her songs by several U.S. radio stations. Frank Sinatra, who performed at the Center the following night, said he wished he could \\"kick her in the ass.\\" =Phish controversy= On June 28‚Äì29, 2000, over 70 people were arrested, in connection with two concerts by jamband Phish. After their breakup, Phish's guitarist Trey Anastasio headlined shows at PNC several times, including a 2006 performance with \\"G.R.A.B.\\" (Gordon.Russo.Anastasio.Benevento.), which included former Phish bassist Mike Gordon. Phish returned to the venue May 31 and June 1, 2011 for a two-night stand during their summer tour, and again on July 10, 2013. =2007 OzzFest incident= On 16 August 2007, controversy was generated as 83 attendees were arrested at the show, most of them underage, and most of them arrested prior to the 8:00 hour, reasons cited for underage drinking and distribution, and \\"aggressive dancing\\"; In addition, two men died, one after ingesting significant amounts of alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. Underage drinking On May 18, 2007, Gwen Stefani performed the opening show for the 2007 season at the venue. The show gained a lot of local media publicity due to the large amount of underage drinking that took place in the parking lot before the show and lack of police to maintain it. At least 27 people, mainly minors, were taken to two area hospitals. The venue announced a zero-tolerance policy to underage drinking, and it was also announced that for the next concert held at the arena, Fall Out Boy on June 6, between 60 and 80 state troopers would be on hand, up from the usual 10-15 and mostly undercover and plain clothed, to detain underage drinkers. Residents of the area claimed underage drinking has always been a problem at the venue, but gets worse every year. In response to problems with underage drinking and in the wake of a number of alcohol-related injuries and deaths, drinking in the parking lots was banned at the PNC Bank Arts Center as of August 17, 2007. This policy has been since changed to allow tailgating and alcohol consumption in the parking lots for specific events. PNC later published a list stating which events would allow tailgating; shows drawing a younger audience would have no tailgating while shows such as Kenny Chesney would allow it.

It was the crime imputed by common law whereby a person disobeyed an Act of Parliament which did not say what the penalty was nor how it was to be enforced - the crime itself was recognised. The doctrine was based on the original custom that an Act of Parliament was an expression of the Sovereign's will, enacted with the \\"advice and consent\\" of Parliament. It has been mainly overturned in precedent since the English interregnum. Thus in modern jurisprudence, contravening a statute is not a crime unless the statute expressly says so in clear terms.

The instruments consist of a round, hexagonal, or octagonal sound box at the bottom with a neck attached that protrudes upwards. They also usually have two strings, and their soundboxes are typically covered with either snakeskin (most often python) or thin wood. Huqin instruments usually have two tuning pegs, one peg for each string. The pegs are attached horizontally through holes drilled in the instrument's neck. Most huqin have the bow hair pass in between the strings. Exceptions to having two strings and pegs include variations of huqin with three, four, and sometimes even more than five. These include the zhuihu, a three stringed huqin, the sihu, a huqin of Mongolian origin, and the sanhu, a lesser-known three-stringed variation. The most common huqin are the erhu, which are tuned to a middle range; zhonghu, which is tuned to a lower register, and gaohu, which is tuned to a higher pitch. The lowest pitched huqins include the dahu and gehu. The highest pitched huqin is the jinghu, used in the Beijing opera. Over eighty types of huqin instruments have been documented. Huqin instruments are believed to have come from the nomadic Hu people, who lived on the extremities of ancient Chinese kingdoms, possibly descending from an instrument called the Xiqin (Â•öÁê¥), originally played by the Mongolic Xi tribe. Like the people of China, Mongolian people also have cultural and ethnic heritage of the ancient Hu nomads, and the Mongol version of the xiqin, known as the khuuchir, is testament to this shared heritage. –•—É—É—á–∏—Ä mongol.undesten.mn In the 20th century, large bass huqin such as the dihu, gehu, and diyingehu were developed for use in modern Chinese orchestras. Of these, the gehu and diyingehu would be analogous to Occidental cellos and double basses respectively, and were designed to have a timbre that would blend in with the sound of traditional huqin. These instruments generally have four strings and fingerboards, and are played in a similar manner to cellos and double basses, and are very different from the traditional huqin. Similar instruments also feature in the music traditions of neighboring countries, such as Mongolia, Korea, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.

Jet engines and aircraft windshields are particularly vulnerable to damage from such strikes, and are the most common target in such tests. Whole, dead, standard-size chickens, as would be used for cooking, are thought to accurately simulate a large, live bird striking a plane in flight. The aircraft component to be tested (engine, windshield, etc.) is fixed in place on a test stand, and the cannon fires the chicken at it. The chicken gun was first used in the mid-1950s at de Havilland Aircraft, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The chickens were killed at a local farm shortly before use. Another early use of a chicken gun was by the Royal Aeronautical (Aircraft) Establishment (RAE) in Farnborough, Hampshire in 1961. In the 1970s, Goodyear Aerospace in Litchfield Park, Arizona, used a gun with a ceramic diaphragm to seal the compressed air at the back of the gun's barrel. To fire the gun, a needle struck and ruptured the diaphragm, allowing the compressed air to drive the chicken (in its container‚Äîa cylindrical cardboard ice cream carton) down the barrel. At the muzzle, a metal ring stopped the carton, but allowed the chicken to pass through. Cameras recorded the collision. The United States Air Force commissioned the AEDC Ballistic Range S-3 to test airplane canopies, which began operating in 1972. The gun was later used to test other aircraft parts such as the leading edges of wings. During the development of the Boeing 757 in the 1970s, the cockpit windows were subjected to a \\"chicken test\\", where \\"an anesthetized chicken was loaded in a pneumatic gun and fired at head-on\\".

It was part of the territory of Rechberg until 1467 when it was made a Lordship for the House of Frundsberg. It was raised to a Barony in 1569, was annexed by Maxelrain in 1586, annexed by Leuchtenberg in 1618, and created a Principality for John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough in 1704 for his service in the War of the Spanish Succession. 1705 Creation In recognition of Marlborough's efforts as commander-in-chief of the Grand Alliance's armies Emperor Leopold I proposed in 1704 to make Marlborough a sovereign prince of the Holy Roman Empire. He was created thus on 28 August 1704, then made Prince of Mindelheim on 18 November 1705 by Emperor Joseph I, and formally invested with this title on 24 May 1706 at the Imperial Diet.Holmes, R. (2008) \\"Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius\\" (London: HarperPress) pgs 302-303 The principality was carved out of Imperial land in Swabia, and measured approximately fifteen square miles.

(2008) \\"Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius\\" (London: HarperPress) pg 303 Marlborough visited the principality only once in his life, in 1713, and stayed a mere four days. However he was well received by his subjects. He wrote of his visit 'I liked much better than expected but not so, as to think of living there'. In 1713, as a conclusion of the war came about, Mindelheim was likely to be annexed by the Electorate of Bavaria. Marlborough succeeded in getting Mindelheim swapped for the county of Nellenburg in Upper Austria, which was not elevated to be a principality. Mindelheim was duly annexed under the Treaty of Utrecht. After the Treaty of Utrecht led to the loss of his Principality of Mindelheim, it was discussed to make John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough prince of Nellenburg. Austrian law did not allow for the elevation into a sovereign principality though, and the plan was dropped in or after 1717. Nellenburg, therefore, never became a principality or a state of the Holy Roman Empire.[1] Lords of Mindelheim (1467-1559) *Ulrich X (1467-1478) *Georg II (1478-1528) *Casper (1528-1536) *George III (1536-1559) Baron of Mindelheim (1559-1586) *George III (1559-1586) Prince of Mindelheim (1705-1714) *John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough (1705-1714) See also * Mindelheim References Category:Former states and territories of Bavaria Mindelheim Mindelheim Category:1467 establishments in Europe Category:States and territories established in 1467 Category:1705 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Principality of Mindelheim"},{"id":"2434650","text":"Ahmadreza Abedzadeh (, born 25 May 1966) is an Iranian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He played for Esteghlal, Sepahan, Persepolis and the Iranian national team. He made 79 appearances for Iran, and played for his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Club career Abedzadeh had an unbeaten record in the Tehran derby with 13 matches, 7 wins and 6 draws. While playing for Persepolis, he went 802 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal. International career Abedzadeh was called up at the age of 18 for the Iran national under-20 football team in 1984. After his good shows, he was invited to the senior team in 1987 by then-manager Parviz Dehdari. Abedzadeh made his debut in the match against Kuwait on 27 February 1987, in which he conceded a goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory. He started in the 1990 Asian Games, where they won the gold medal after defeating North Korea in the final and Abedzadeh saved two penalties. At the tournament, he conceded only two goals which were both scored from penalty kicks. Iran defeated Australia in the FIFA World Cup qualification play-offs to reach 1998 FIFA World Cup, their second participation in the World Cup and first since 1978. He missed the first match at the World Cup against Yugoslavia due to injury, then captained Iran at the next two matches against United States and Germany. Iran finished third at their group and Abedzadeh announced his retirement from international football after the final match. Post-playing career Abedzadeh suffered a stroke in 2001 and that was the point in which he let go of professional football. He was released some weeks later, but required a number of surgeries after, and even to this day, has side effects from his stroke. Abedzadeh suffered again on 11 March 2007 when his mother died. He has also been the goalkeeping coach for many clubs after retiring from playing football. He coached Saipa in 2001, Esteghlal Ahvaz in 2005, Persepolis from 2008 to 2009, Steel Azin in 2010 and Los Angeles Blues from 2011 to 2012. Legacy Dubbed the Eagle of Asia for his ability to protect the net, his international career stretched for an illustrious 11 years, a tenure that provided stability and uncanny leadership. In 2009, he was named in a poll as Iran's favorite player of last 30 years. His goalkeeping legacy in Iran is rivaled only by Nasser Hejazi.

The cast includes several well-known British comedy and character actors, including James Robertson Justice, Stanley Baxter in a dual role as a dour Scottish prisoner and a German prisoner-of-war camp officer, Eric Sykes, John Le Mesurier, Leslie Phillips and Richard Wattis. The film had its world premiere on 20 April 1961 at the Leicester Square Theatre in London's West End and went on general release in late May on Rank's second string National circuit. Plot Sir Ernest Pease (James Robertson Justice), a brilliant but acerbic scientist, is the subject of a television programme based on This Is Your Life during which he is re-united with past acquaintances. He does not remember the senior British Army officer at all! A flashback ensues. In 1942, Pease is in charge of very important aircraft research during the Second World War. He needs to take a trip on a bomber to gain first-hand knowledge of the environment under which his special equipment is to be used. However, no one must know who he is. He goes as Lieutenant Farrow, a Royal Navy public relations officer. The bomber is hit over Germany and, ignoring a crewman's warning, Pease is sucked out through a hole in the side of the aeroplane, but parachutes safely to the ground. He is captured and sent to a prisoner of war camp mostly occupied by Royal Air Force officers. His excellent command of German causes him to be suspected of being a spy, but when his real identity becomes known to Group Captain Travers (Norman Bird), the senior British officer, he informs the men in his hut of his importance and that his escape is a top priority. Among Pease's roommates are Jimmy Cooper (Leslie Phillips), \\"Jock\\" Everett (Stanley Baxter), and \\"Bonzo\\" Baines (Jeremy Lloyd). Pease is offered an opportunity to escape through a tunnel with two other men. However, he expects the pair to be easily recaptured (which does in fact occur). He instead plans to go into hiding after a fake escape attempt. He presumes the Germans will search for him for two weeks then presume he has got away, at which point they will step down the search and he can more safely escape. When the Germans eventually assume he has succeeded in getting away and lose interest, he will walk out of the camp, disguised as one of three visiting Swiss Red Cross observers, along with Cooper and Baines (which has echoes of a real Second World War escape from Spangenberg by RAF officers Dominic Bruce, the \\"Medium Sized Man\\" of Colditz fame; Pete Tunstall; and \\"Useless\\" Eustace Newborn, who escaped dressed as Swiss Red Cross doctors). Crucial to the plan is that Everett looks like the camp Lager (compound) officer, Major Stampfel (also played by Baxter, even though he describes him as \\"hideously ugly\\"). He must impersonate Stampfel, as he will be escorting the delegation. The escape committee, headed by Wing Commander Piggott (John Le Mesurier), are very dissatisfied with Pease's plan, but Pease is determined to see it through. The plan nearly comes unstuck at the last moment, when another prisoner, \\"Grassy\\" Green (John Forrest), is revealed as an astute undercover Luftwaffe intelligence officer. He takes them at gunpoint, but mistakes Everett for Stampfel and is \\"dealt with\\". Pease, Cooper and Baines walk out of the camp and eventually make their way back home. Returning to the television programme, Pease is reunited with Baines, now a leading designer of ladies' foundation garments; Cooper, a missionary in India; Everett, a West London undertaker; and Stampfel, who has become a popular entertainment manager at a British holiday camp.

It was briefly mentioned in Paul Brickhill's book The Great Escape. There were in fact two such 'Swiss Commission' escapes from German POW camps holding RAF prisoners - Oflag IXA/H, Spangenberg, in 1941, and Oflag VIB, Warburg, in 1942. The escape in 'Very Important Person' is based upon the latter, which was an Army-RAF joint effort, and not the one mentioned by Paul Brickhill. Both escapes are described by Charles Rollings in his books 'Wire and Walls' and 'Wire and Worse'. The film's screenplay was later made into a novelisation with the same title by John Foley, which has erroneously caused John Foley to sometimes be credited as author of the novel upon which the film is based. However, it was the other way around: his novel is based on the film.Amazon UK: Very Important Person. A book written by J. Foley, based on a film script by Jack Davies.

The song appears on their 1983 album, The Final Cut. It is the eighth track on the album and is arranged between \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\" and \\"Southampton Dock\\". The song is also featured on the Pink Floyd compilations Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and A Foot in the Door ‚Äì The Best of Pink Floyd. History The song is about Waters' frustration with the leadership of the world since World War II, mentioning many world leaders by name (Ronald Reagan, Alexander Haig, Menachem Begin, Margaret Thatcher, Ian Paisley, Leonid Brezhnev, Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon), suggesting that these \\"colonial wasters of life and limb\\" be segregated into a specially- founded retirement home. It labels all the world leaders as \\"overgrown infants\\" and \\"incurable tyrants\\" and suggests they are incapable of understanding anything other than violence or their own faces on a television screen. In its concluding lines, the narrator of the song gathers all of the \\"tyrants\\" inside the Fletcher Memorial Home and imagines applying \\"the Final Solution\\" to them. Fletcher in the name of the song is in honour and remembrance of Roger Waters' father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who was killed during the Second World War at Anzio. The Fletcher Memorial Home scenes in The Final Cut film were filmed at Forty Hall in Enfield. Reception In a review for The Final Cut, Patrick Schabe of PopMatters described \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" as \\"majestic, but clunky\\".
