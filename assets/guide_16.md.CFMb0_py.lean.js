It was built in 1565 for the Doge Ambrogio Di Negro o for his son Orazio, in a coastal area that used to be outside of the city walls. The villa passed to the Durazzo family, who commissioned a renovation in the neoclassical style at the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, the construction of the railway Turin-Genoa led to the destruction of the garden at the sea side, while the hill side remained largely untouched. The villa and the park are now owned by the Municipality of Genoa and destined to public use. The villa is located near the Dinegro station of the Metro of Genoa.  History  The villa was commissioned in the 16th century by Doge Ambrogio Di Negro or his son Orazio in an area known as \\"Fassolo\\" - at the time outside of the city walls - where the Di Negro family owned a villa already since the beginning of the 15th century. Passed first to the Maniero family, then to the Durazzo family, the villa was completely remodeled in 1787 by the genoese architect Emanuele Andrea Tagliafichi for Gian Luca Durazzo, when it received the current neoclassical appearance. In the 19th century the villa hosted famous guests, including Caroline of Brunswick, wife of George IV of England (1815), Pope Pius VII (1836), Honor√© de Balzac and Lorenzo Pareto. Passed to the Rolla Rosazza family, it was later acquired by the Municipality of Genoa. The original setting has radically changed as a result of the urbanization of the area and, in particular, of the construction of the Turin-Genoa railway in the 19th century, which led to the loss of the garden at the sea side. The garden at the hill side was renovated in 2015 and is now a public park.  Description  = Architecture = The original appearance of the 16th- century villa, testified by an 18th-century engraving, featured a facade with loggias, architectural structures and large statues attributed to Giovanni Andrea Ansaldo. After the 18th century remodeling, the facade presents neoclassical structures with sculptures by Nicol√≤ Stefano Traverso. Internally, the irregular layout shows an atypical distribution of the spaces. = Decoration = The internal decoration preserves original 16th century elements, such as the portals, the frescoes in the piano nobile showing the achievements of Doge Ambrogio Di Negro against the Corsicans, and the grotesque paintings in the other rooms. Some 18th century elements are also visible, such as stucco decorations. = Garden = The park of the villa, designed by the architect Tagliafichi in the 18th century, extended from the sea to the hill. While the front part is now lost, a monumental nymphaeum remains at the level of the main building, as well as the part at the back of the villa. The original distribution is documented by Martin-Pierre Gauthier.  References   Bibliography  * Lauro Magnani (1978). Villa Rosazza (lo Scoglietto), Guide di Genova n. 69.

It was established in 1949 as a Technical School and commissioned in 1957 as Accra Technical Institute. In 1963, the Institute was renamed Accra Polytechnic, by the orders of the then President, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. By the Polytechnic Law of 1992 (PNDC 321), which became fully operative in the 1993/1994 academic year. Accra Polytechnic was elevated to a tertiary status. The institution was then placed under the Higher Education Council with autonomy to award Higher National Diplomas (through the National Board for Professional and Technician Examinations [NABPTEX]). GCB 347613With the passage of the PNDC Law 321, the University upgraded its programmes and facilities in it to provide middle-level manpower to revolutionise and feed the growing Ghanaian industries. Notwithstanding the difficulties that characterized the sudden change over from secondary to a tertiary status, Accra Technical University made a tremendous progress in its review and expansion of curricula to suit contemporary needs. Accra Technical University began to offer Higher National Diploma (HND) programmes in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical/Electronic Engineering, Building Technology, Civil Engineering, Furniture Design and Production, Secretaryship and Management Studies, Bilingual Secretaryship and Management Studies, Accountancy, Marketing, Purchasing and Supply, Hotel Catering and Institutional Management, Fashion Design and Textiles, Mathematics and Statistics, and Science Laboratory Technology.

Biography =Early life= Son of a Saint-L√¥ lawyer, Paul Harel often skipped school and was apprenticed to the pharmacist of Montreuil-l'Argill√© at the age of fourteen, where he sold ointments while learning a little Latin from the local priest. From sixteen to nineteen, he was a typographer in Nogent-le-Rotrou, where he prints the works of Paulin Paris, Gaston Paris and Paul Meyer Th√©ophile F√©ret said of him: > \\"Since the rhymes of brooch and sword, everyone knows the innkeeper of > √âchauffour, and since the Memories of inn, he has annexed his great hall to > literature Norman. Before Barres, he identified some of the intimate > connections between lineage, soil and ancestral worship. He wanted to root > us in the homeland. \\" In the preface to his first collection, Under the Apple Trees, published in 1879, Paul Harel took care to explain why he embraced the profession of hotelier: > \\"My father was a lawyer, my grandfather innkeeper; I took up the job of this > one for the sake of the picturesque. I thought I ought to give this bad > example to my contemporaries, at a time when the sons of the earth are > deserting their homes, where the life of the ancestors is unknown, if not > scorned. If he has not regretted his choice, it is also a little because for > him, \\"the great secret of everything is in charity\\", and that the ancestral > profession allows him to practice this virtue on a large scale by welcoming > to his home the poor, the beggars who pass on the road. =Later life= Paul Harel was loved in return. He enjoyed a good reputation in his country. \\"In the Orne,\\" says F√©ret, \\"one bears a religious tenderness to him. \\" Paul Harel has sung the charms of nature and rural life with a sincerity and simplicity that exclude neither the picturesque nor the grandeur. In his last volume, which he prefers to others, The Far Hours (1903), he draws his inspiration above all from faith, which he can not conceive without charity. In 1895 he was called to direct, in Paris, a great Catholic magazine, La Quinzaine. But the splendours of the capital could not make him forget his native country: loving rustic simplicity, he soon resigned his directorial functions to return to Echauffour.

Range and habitat It is found in the eastern half of Southern Africa, with its range including Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. Conservation It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this assessment category because it has a large geographic range, as well as a population size of approximately 20,000 adults. Potential threats to this species include habitat loss; the old mines that it uses as roosts are subject to disturbance if and when they are reopened. Its range includes protected areas, such as «ÄAi-«ÄAis/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park and Augrabies Falls National Park.

Plot summary The story is set in Spain during the Peninsular War, in the coastal town of Menda. The occupying French garrison is commanded by a young officer named Victor Marchand, and he is in love with Clara, the daughter of Marquis L√©gan√®s, who is the local grandee. One night under cover of a local festival, there is an uprising against the French garrison, supported by British naval ships. The uprising is led by the Marquis and his sons. Marchand survives because he is warned by Clara, and as the last French survivor he flees to the nearby French military headquarters. A few days later, the French retake Menda. The town surrenders without a fight, since the British had only sent ships with artillery, and no ground troops. The French general accepts the surrender, and promises not to loot and pillage the town in exchange for money, and the surrender of the leading citizens. The general then orders the hanging of the leaders of the uprising, including Marquis L√©gan√®s and his whole family. Marquis L√©gan√®s asks the general, that he and his family be executed by beheading rather than hanging, and that his eldest son should be spared. The general agrees on condition that the son carry out the executions of his family. L√©gan√®s and the rest of his family persuade the eldest son, Juanito to agree. Marchand tries to persuade Clara that she will be spared if she agrees to marry him, but she refuses. Juanito then carries out the beheading of his father, two brothers and two sisters. The final intended victim is his mother which causes him to hesitate. She kills herself by jumping off the castle walls. The story concludes by saying that Juanito does inherit his father's title. The King of Spain has given him the title of El Verdugo (the Executioner), but in his grief and guilt, Juanito shuns society.

Schneider has authored several books, including The Censor's Hand: The Misregulation of Human-Subject Research.  Views on institutional review boards  Schneider has argued that institutional review boards are unnecessary and harmful, restricting useful and innocuous research while being likely to permit truly dangerous studies. He stated in a 2018 lecture that IRBs are \\"deeply unethical system[s] of regulation\\" because they fail to reach consistent decisions and prohibit many experiments which have the potential to benefit patient health. Schneider cited a multi-center study of vitamin A supplementation for neonatal ICU patients which IRBs halted: one institution's IRB rejected the study because it considered the experiment unnecessary, claiming the benefits of vitamin A supplementation were proven; another denied it because it considered the effects of vitamin A on neonates too ill-studied to be ethical. He continued by noting that even without IRB approval, the doctors running the study would have had the ability to give or not give vitamin A to their patients, and even to collect data on the two groups. However, to compare the patients would require IRB approval.

She had to stop at Kirkwall for inspection by the British authorities and spent 4 days there, departing 16 April 1915 to Sunderland. Upon arrival there next day, she had to unload part of her cargo including oil, leather and food supplies deemed to be contraband by the British. She left from Sunderland on 1 May 1915 with only 1,500 tons of cargo. Shortly after 22:00 on May 1, about east-northeast from the Longstone Lighthouse the ship was struck on port side in her engine room by a torpedo. The vessel quickly filled up with water, forcing her Captain Johan Endresen to order the crew to abandon ship. Three lifeboats were lowered and all 37 crew left the ship. America sank stern first at about 00:50 on May 2 in an approximate position . The torpedo was launched by the German submarine .

This attack was code-named Operation Meetinghouse by the USAAF and is known as the Great Tokyo Air Raid in Japan. Bombs dropped from 279 Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers burned out much of eastern Tokyo. More than 90,000 and possibly over 100,000 Japanese people were killed, mostly civilians, and one million were left homeless, making it the most destructive single air attack in human history. The Japanese air and civil defenses proved largely inadequate; 14 American aircraft and 96 airmen were lost. The attack on Tokyo was an intensification of the air raids on Japan which had begun in June 1944. Prior to this operation, the USAAF had focused on a precision bombing campaign against Japanese industrial facilities. These attacks were generally unsuccessful, which contributed to the decision to shift to firebombing. The operation during the early hours of 10 March was the first major firebombing raid against a Japanese city, and the USAAF units employed significantly different tactics from those used in precision raids, including bombing by night with the aircraft flying at low altitudes. The extensive destruction caused by the raid led to these tactics becoming standard for the USAAF's B-29s until the end of the war. There has been a long-running debate over the morality of the 10 March firebombing of Tokyo. The raid is often cited as a key example in criticism of the Allies' strategic bombing campaigns, with many historians and commentators arguing that it was not acceptable for the USAAF to deliberately target civilians, and other historians stating that the USAAF had no choice but to change to area bombing tactics given that the precision bombing campaign had failed. It is generally acknowledged that the tactics used against Tokyo and in similar subsequent raids were militarily successful. The attack is commemorated at two official memorials, several neighborhood memorials, and a privately run museum. Background Pre-war USAAF doctrine emphasized the precision bombing of key industrial facilities over area bombing of cities. Early American strategic bombing attacks on Germany used precision tactics, with the bomber crews seeking to visually identify their targets. This proved difficult to achieve in practice. During the last 20 months of the war in Europe, non-visual attacks accounted for about half of the American strategic bombing campaign against Germany. These included major area bombing raids on Berlin and Dresden, as well as attacks on several towns and cities conducted as part of Operation Clarion. The American attacks on Germany mainly used high-explosive bombs, with incendiary bombs accounting for only 14 percent of those dropped by the Eighth Air Force. The British Bomber Command focused on destroying German cities from early 1942 until the end of the war, and incendiaries represented 21 percent of the tonnage of bombs its aircraft dropped. Area bombing of German cities by Allied forces resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and massive firestorms in cities such as Hamburg and Dresden. A B-29 dropping conventional bombs over Japan. The bombs are being scattered by the wind, a common occurrence which made precision bombing difficult. Japanese forces conducted area bombing attacks on Chinese cities throughout the war. Few attempts were made to target industrial facilities, with the goal of the campaign being to terrorize civilians and cut the Chinese forces off from their sources of supplies. Chongqing, China's provisional capital, was frequently attacked by aircraft using incendiary and high explosive bombs. These raids destroyed most of the city. The American Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 was the first air attack on Tokyo, but inflicted little damage on the city. In June 1944 the USAAF's XX Bomber Command began a campaign against Japan using B-29 Superfortress bombers flying from airfields in China. Tokyo was beyond the range of Superfortresses operating from China, and was not attacked. This changed in October 1944, when the B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command began moving into airfields in the Mariana Islands. These islands were close enough to Japan for the B-29s to conduct a sustained bombing campaign against Tokyo and most other Japanese cities. The first Superfortress flight over Tokyo took place on 1November, when a reconnaissance aircraft photographed industrial facilities and urban areas in the western districts of the city. The remainder of Tokyo was photographed in subsequent reconnaissance flights, and these images were used to plan the 10 March raid and other attacks on urban areas. The overall plan for the strategic bombing campaign against Japan specified that it would commence with precision bombing raids against key industrial facilities, and later include firebombing attacks on cities. The first target directive issued to the XXI Bomber Command by its parent unit, the Twentieth Air Force, on 11 November, 1944 specified that the main target was Japanese aircraft and aviation engine factories. These targets were to be attacked by precision bombing. Japanese cities were specified as the secondary target, with area bombing being authorized for use against them. The directive also indicated that firebombing raids were likely to be ordered against cities to test the effectiveness of this tactic. The Twentieth Air Force had an unusual command structure, as it was personally headed by General Henry H. Arnold, the commanding officer of the USAAF. B-29 raids on Tokyo commenced on 24 November. The first raid targeted an aircraft engine factory on the city's outskirts, and caused little damage. XXI Bomber Command's subsequent raids on Tokyo and other cities mainly used precision bombing tactics and high explosive bombs, and were largely unsuccessful due to adverse weather conditions and a range of mechanical problems which affected the B-29s. These failures led to the head of the Command being relieved in January 1945. Major General Curtis LeMay, the commander of XX Bomber Command, replaced him. Arnold and the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters regarded the campaign against Japan up to that time as unsuccessful, and LeMay understood that he would also be relieved if he failed to deliver results. LeMay believed that changing the emphasis from precision bombing to area bombing was the most promising option to turn the XXI Bomber Command's performance around. Preparations =Early incendiary raids on Japan= USAAF planners began assessing the feasibility of a firebombing campaign against Japanese cities in 1943. Japan's main industrial facilities were vulnerable to such attacks as they were concentrated in several large cities, and a high proportion of production took place in homes and small factories in urban areas. The planners estimated that incendiary bomb attacks on Japan's six largest cities could cause physical damage to almost 40 percent of industrial facilities and result in the loss of 7.6 million man-months of labor. It was also estimated that these attacks would kill over 500,000 people, render about 7.75 million homeless and force almost 3.5 million to be evacuated. The plans for the strategic bombing offensive against Japan developed in 1943 specified that it would transition from a focus on the precision bombing of industrial targets to area bombing from around halfway in the campaign, which was forecast to be in March 1945. Two M69 incendiaries on display at the Niigata Prefectural Museum of History Preparations for firebombing raids against Japan began well before March 1945. In 1943 the USAAF tested the effectiveness of incendiary bombs on adjoining German and Japanese-style domestic building complexes at the Dugway Proving Ground. These trials demonstrated that M69 incendiaries were particularly effective at starting uncontrollable fires. These weapons were dropped from B-29s in clusters, and used napalm as their incendiary filler. After the bomb struck the ground, a fuse ignited a charge which first sprayed napalm from the weapon, and then ignited it. Prior to March 1945, stockpiles of incendiary bombs were built up in the Mariana Islands. These were accumulated on the basis of XXI Bomber Command plans which specified that the B-29s would each carry of the weapons on 40 percent of their monthly sorties. Arnold and the Air Staff wanted to wait to use the incendiaries until a large-scale program of firebombing could be mounted, to overwhelm the Japanese city defenses. Several raids were conducted to test the effectiveness of firebombing against Japanese cities. A small incendiary attack was made against Tokyo on the night of 29/30 November 1944, but caused little damage. Incendiaries were also used as part of several other raids. On 18 December 84 XX Bomber Command B-29s conducted an incendiary raid on the Chinese city of Hankou which caused extensive damage. That day, the Twentieth Air Force directed XXI Bomber Command to dispatch 100 B-29s on a firebombing raid against Nagoya. An initial attack took place on 22 December which was directed at an aircraft factory and involved 78 bombers using precision bombing tactics. Few of the incendiaries landed in the target area. On 3January, 97 Superfortresses were dispatched to firebomb Nagoya. This attack started some fires, which were soon brought under control by firefighters. The success in countering the raid led the Japanese authorities to become over-confident about their ability to protect cities against incendiary attacks. The next firebombing raid was directed against Kobe on 4February, and bombs dropped from 69 B-29s started fires which destroyed or damaged 1,039 buildings. On 19 February the Twentieth Air Force issued a new targeting directive for XXI Bomber Command. While the Japanese aviation industry remained the primary target, the directive placed a stronger emphasis on firebombing raids against Japanese cities. The directive also called for a large-scale trial incendiary raid as soon as possible. This attack was made against Tokyo on 25 February. A total of 231 B-29s were dispatched, of which 172 arrived over the city; this was XXI Bomber Command's largest raid up to that time. The attack was conducted in daylight, with the bombers flying in formation at high altitudes. It caused extensive damage, with almost 28,000 buildings being destroyed. This was the most destructive raid to have been conducted against Japan, and LeMay and the Twentieth Air Force judged that it demonstrated that large-scale firebombing was an effective tactic. The failure of a precision bombing attack on an aircraft factory in Tokyo on 4March marked the end of the period in which XXI Bomber Command primarily conducted such raids. Civilian casualties during these operations had been relatively low; for instance, all the raids against Tokyo prior to 10 March caused 1,292 deaths in the city. =Preparations to attack Tokyo= In early March LeMay judged that further precision bombing of Japanese industrial targets was unlikely to be successful due to the prevailing weather conditions over the country. There were on average only seven days of clear skies each month, and an intense jet stream made it difficult to aim bombs from high altitudes. Due to these constraints, LeMay decided to focus XXI Bomber Command's attacks on Japanese cities. While he made this decision on his own initiative, the general directions issued to LeMay permitted such operations. On 5March XXI Bomber Command's personnel were advised that no further major attacks would be scheduled until 9March. During this period LeMay's staff finalized plans for the attack on Tokyo. At a meeting on 7March, LeMay agreed to conduct an intense series of raids against targets on the island of Honshu between 9and 22 March as part of the preparations for the invasion of Okinawa on 1April. LeMay decided to adopt radically different tactics for this campaign. Analysis by XXI Bomber Command staff of the 25 February raid concluded that the incendiary bombs had been dropped from too high an altitude, and attacking at lower levels would both improve accuracy and enable the B-29s to carry more bombs. This would also expose them to the Japanese air defenses, but LeMay judged that poor Japanese fire control tactics meant that the additional risk was moderate. As weather conditions over Japan tended to be more favorable at night and the LORAN systems the B-29s used to navigate were more effective after dusk, it was also decided to conduct the attack at night. This led to a decision to direct the aircraft to attack individually rather than in formations as it was not possible for the B-29s to keep station at night. Flying individually would also lead to reductions in fuel consumption as the pilots would not need to constantly adjust their engines to remain in formation. These fuel savings allowed the Superfortresses to carry twice their usual bomb load. USAAF intelligence had determined that the Japanese had only two night fighter units, and these were believed to pose little threat. As a result, LeMay decided to remove all of the B-29s' guns other than those at the rear of the aircraft to reduce the weight of the aircraft and further boost the weight of bombs they could carry. While LeMay made the ultimate decision to adopt the new tactics, he acknowledged that his plan combined ideas put forward by many officers. On 7March, some of the B-29 crews flew training missions in which they practiced using radar to navigate and attack a target from low altitude. The airmen were not told the purpose of this training. The officers who commanded XXI Bomber Command's three flying wings agreed with the new tactics, but there were fears that they could result in heavy casualties. These concerns were shared by some of LeMay's staff. XXI Bomber Command's intelligence officers predicted that 70 percent of the bombers could be destroyed. LeMay consulted Arnold's chief of staff Brigadier General Lauris Norstad about the new tactics, but did not formally seek approval to adopt them. He later justified this action on the grounds that he had wanted to protect Arnold from blame had the attack been a failure. LeMay notified the Twentieth Air Force headquarters of his intended tactics on 8March, a day he knew Arnold and Norstad would be absent. There is no evidence that LeMay expected that the Twentieth Air Force would object to firebombing civilian areas, but he may have been concerned that it would have judged that the new tactics were too risky. =Japanese defenses= The Japanese military anticipated that the USAAF would make major night attacks on the Tokyo region. After several small night raids were conducted on the region during December 1944 and January 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's 10th Air Division, which was responsible for intercepting attacks on the Kant≈ç region, placed a greater emphasis on training its pilots to operate at night. One of the division's flying regiments (the 53rd Air Regiment) was also converted to a specialized night fighter unit. On the night of 3/4 March, the Japanese military intercepted American radio signals which indicated that the XXI Bomber Command was conducting a major night flying exercise. This was interpreted to mean that the force was preparing to start large-scale night raids on Japan. However, the Japanese did not expect the Americans to change to low altitude bombing tactics. The military forces assigned to protect Tokyo were insufficient to stop a major raid. The Eastern District Army's Kanto Air Defense Sector was responsible for the air defense of the Tokyo region, and was accorded the highest priority for aircraft and antiaircraft guns. The 1st Antiaircraft Division controlled the antiaircraft guns stationed in the central region of Honshu, including Tokyo. It was made up of eight regiments with a total of 780 antiaircraft guns, as well as a regiment equipped with searchlights. American military intelligence estimated that 331 heavy and 307 light antiaircraft guns were allocated to Tokyo's defenses at the time of the raid. A network of picket boats, radar stations and lookout posts was responsible for detecting incoming raids. Due to shortages of radar and other fire control equipment, Japanese antiaircraft gunners found it difficult to target aircraft operating at night. The radar stations had a short range and fire control equipment for the antiaircraft batteries was unsophisticated. As of March 1945, most of the 10th Air Division's 210 combat aircraft were day fighters, with the 53rd Air Regiment operating 25 or 26 night fighters. The regiment was experiencing difficulties converting to the night fighter role, which included an overly intensive training program that exhausted its pilots. Tokyo's civil defenses were also lacking. The city's fire department comprised around 8,000 firemen spread between 287 fire stations, but they had little modern firefighting equipment. The firefighting tactics used by the fire department were ineffective against incendiary bombs. Civilians had been organized into more than 140,000 neighborhood firefighting associations with a nominal strength of 2.75 million people, but these were also ill-equipped. The basic equipment issued to the firefighting associations was incapable of extinguishing fires started by M69s. Few air raid shelters had been constructed, though most households dug crude foxholes to shelter in near their homes. Firebreaks had been created across the city in an attempt to stop the spread of fire; over 200,000 houses were destroyed as part of this effort. Rubble was often not cleared from the firebreaks, which provided a source of fuel. The Japanese Government also encouraged children and civilians with non- essential jobs to evacuate Tokyo, and 1.7 million had departed by March 1945. However, many other civilians had moved into Tokyo from impoverished rural areas over the same period. Attack A map showing the areas of Tokyo that were destroyed during World War II. The area burned out during the raid on 9/10 March is marked in black. =Departure= On 8 March LeMay issued orders for a major firebombing attack on Tokyo the next night. The raid was to target a rectangular area in northeastern Tokyo designated Zone I by the USAAF which measured approximately by . This area was divided by the Sumida River, and included most of Asakusa, Honjo and Fukagawa Wards. These wards formed part of the informally defined Shitamachi district of Tokyo, which was mainly populated by working-class people and artisans. With a population of around 1.1 million, it was one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world. Zone I contained few militarily significant industrial facilities, though there were a large number of small factories which supplied Japan's war industries. The area was highly vulnerable to firebombing, as most buildings were constructed from wood and bamboo and were closely spaced. Due to this vulnerability, it had suffered extensive damage and heavy casualties from fires caused by the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. The United States' intelligence services were aware of how vulnerable the region remained to fire, with the Office of Strategic Services rating it as containing the most combustible districts in Tokyo. The orders for the raid issued to the B-29 crews stated that the main purpose of the attack was to destroy the many small factories located within the target area, but also noted that it was intended to cause civilian casualties as a means of disrupting production at major industrial facilities. Each of XXI Bomber Command's three wings was allocated a different altitude to bomb from, in bands between and . These altitudes were calculated to be too high for the light Japanese antiaircraft guns to reach, and below the effective range of the heavy antiaircraft guns. LeMay was unable to lead the raid in person as he had been prohibited from placing himself in a situation where he could be captured after being briefed on the development of atomic bombs. Instead, the attack was led by the 314th Bombardment Wing's commanding officer, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power. LeMay considered Power to be the best of the wing commanding officers. The new tactics which were to be used in the operation were not well received by many airmen, who believed that it was safer to bomb from high altitudes and preferred to retain their defensive guns. Leaving behind the unneeded gunners also troubled many of the airmen, as bomber crews typically had a very close relationship. In preparation for the attack, XXI Bomber Command's maintenance staff worked intensively over a 36-hour period to ready as many aircraft as possible. This effort proved successful, and 83 percent of the B-29s were available for action compared to the average serviceability rate of 60 percent. Other ground crew loaded the aircraft with bombs and fuel. A total of 346 B-29s were readied. The 73rd Bombardment Wing contributed 169 B-29s and the 313th Bombardment Wing 121; both units were based on Saipan. At the time of the raid the 314th Bombardment Wing was arriving at Guam in the Marianas, and able to provide only 56 B-29s. The B-29s in the squadrons which were scheduled to arrive over Tokyo first were armed with M47 bombs; these weapons used napalm and were capable of starting fires which required mechanized firefighting equipment to control. The bombers in the other units were loaded with clusters of M69s. The 73rd and 313th Bomb Wings' Superfortresses were each loaded with of bombs. As the 314th Bombardment Wing's B-29s would have to fly a greater distance, they each carried of bombs. The attack force began departing its bases at 5:35 pm local time on 9March. It took two and three quarter hours for all of the 325 B-29s which were dispatched to take off. Turbulence was encountered on the flight to Japan, but the weather over Tokyo was good. There was little cloud cover, and visibility was good for the first bomber crews to arrive over Tokyo; they were able to see clearly for . Conditions on the ground were cold and windy, with the city experiencing gusts of between and blowing from the southeast. The first B-29s over Tokyo were four aircraft tasked with guiding the others in. These Superfortresses arrived over the city shortly before midnight on 9March. They carried extra fuel, additional radios and XXI Bomber Command's best radio operators instead of bombs, and circled Tokyo at an altitude of throughout the raid. This tactic proved unsuccessful, and was later judged to have been unnecessary. =Over Tokyo= The attack on Tokyo commenced at 12:08 am local time on 10 March. Pathfinder bombers simultaneously approached the target area at right angles to each other. These bombers were manned by the 73d and 313th Bombardment Wings' best crews. Their M47 bombs rapidly started fires in an X shape, which was used to direct the attacks for the remainder of the force. Each of XXI Bomber Command's wings and their subordinate groups had been briefed to attack different areas within the X shape to ensure that the raid caused widespread damage. As the fires expanded, the American bombers spread out to attack unaffected parts of the target area. Power's B-29 circled Tokyo for 90 minutes, with a team of cartographers who were assigned to him mapping the spread of the fires. A USAAF reconnaissance photograph of Tokyo taken on 10 March 1945. Part of the area destroyed by the raid is visible at the bottom of the image. The raid lasted for approximately two hours and forty minutes. Visibility over Tokyo decreased over the course of the raid due to the extensive smoke over the city. This led some American aircraft to bomb parts of Tokyo well outside the target area. The heat from the fires also resulted in the final waves of aircraft experiencing heavy turbulence. Some American airmen also needed to use oxygen masks when the odor of burning flesh entered their aircraft. A total of 279 B-29s attacked Tokyo, dropping of bombs. Another 19 Superfortresses which were unable to reach Tokyo struck targets of opportunity or targets of last resort. These aircraft turned back early due to mechanical problems or pilots deciding to abort the main mission because they were afraid of being killed. Tokyo's defenders were expecting an attack, but did not detect the American force until it arrived over the city. The air defense units in the Kanto Plain area had been placed on alert, but the night fighter units were instructed not to sortie any aircraft until an incoming raid was detected. While picket boats spotted the attack force, poor radio reception meant that most of their reports were not received. Due to disorganization in the defense commands, little action was taken on the scattered reports which came in from the boats. At around midnight on 9March a small number of B-29s were detected near Katsuura, but were thought to be conducting reconnaissance flights. Subsequent sightings of B-29s flying at low levels were not taken seriously, and the Japanese radar stations focused on searching for American aircraft operating at their usual high altitudes. The first alarm that a raid was in progress was issued at 12:15 am, just after the B-29s began dropping bombs on Tokyo. The 10th Air Division sortied all of its available night interceptors, and the 1st Antiaircraft Division's searchlight and antiaircraft units went into action. As expected by LeMay, the defense of Tokyo was not effective. Many American units encountered considerable antiaircraft fire, but it was generally aimed at altitudes either above or below the bombers and reduced in intensity over time as gun positions were overwhelmed by fires. Nevertheless, the Japanese gunners shot down 12 B-29s. A further 42 were damaged, of which two had to be written off. The Japanese fighters were ineffective; their pilots received no guidance from radar stations and the efforts of the antiaircraft gunners and fighter units were not coordinated. No B-29s were shot down by fighters, and the American airmen reported only 76 sightings of Japanese fighters and 40 attacks by them over the course of the raid. Several Japanese pilots were killed when their aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed. Five of the downed B-29s managed to ditch in the sea, and their crews were rescued by United States Navy submarines. American casualties were 96 airmen killed or missing, and 6wounded or injured. The surviving B-29s arrived back at their bases in the Mariana Islands between 6:10 and 11:27 am local time on 10 March. Many of the bombers were streaked with ashes from the fires their crews had caused. =On the ground= Nakamise-d≈çri in Asakusa after the raid Widespread fires rapidly developed across northeastern Tokyo. Within 30 minutes of the start of the raid the situation was beyond the fire department's control. An hour into the raid the fire department abandoned its efforts to stop the conflagration. Instead, the firemen focused on guiding people to safety and rescuing those trapped in burning buildings. Over 125 firemen and 500 civil guards who had been assigned to help them were killed, and 96 fire engines destroyed. Driven by the strong wind, the large numbers of small fires started by the American incendiaries rapidly merged into major blazes. These formed firestorms which quickly advanced in a northwesterly direction and destroyed or damaged almost all the buildings in their path. The only buildings which survived the fire were constructed of stone. By an hour after the start of the attack most of eastern Tokyo either had been destroyed or was being affected by fires. Civilians who stayed at their homes or attempted to fight the fire had virtually no chance of survival. Historian Richard B. Frank has written that \\"the key to survival was to grasp quickly that the situation was hopeless and flee\\". Soon after the start of the raid news broadcasts began advising civilians to evacuate as quickly as possible, but not all did so immediately. The foxholes which had been dug near most homes offered no protection against the firestorm, and civilians who sheltered in them were burned to death or died from suffocation. Charred remains of Japanese civilians after the raid Thousands of the evacuating civilians were killed. Families often sought to remain with their local neighborhood associations, but it was easy to become separated in the conditions. Few families managed to stay together throughout the night. Escape frequently proved impossible, as smoke reduced visibility to just a few feet and roads were rapidly cut by the fires. Crowds of civilians often panicked as they rushed towards the perceived safety of canals, with those who fell being crushed to death. The majority of those killed in the raid died while trying to evacuate. In many cases entire families were killed. One of the most deadly incidents occurred when the full bomb load of a B-29 landed in a crowd of civilians crossing the Kokotoi Bridge over the Sumida River causing hundreds of people to be burned to death. Few places in the targeted area provided safety. Many of those who attempted to evacuate to the large parks which had been created as refuges against fires following the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake were killed when the conflagration moved across these open spaces. Similarly, thousands of people who gathered in the grounds of the Sens≈ç-ji temple in Asakusa died. Others sheltered in solid buildings, such as schools or theatres, and in canals. These were not proof against the firestorm, with smoke inhalation and heat killing large numbers of people in schools. Many of the people who attempted to shelter in canals were killed by smoke or when the passing firestorm sucked oxygen out of the area. However, these bodies of water provided safety to thousands of others. The fire finally burned itself out during mid-morning on 10 March, and came to a stop when it reached large open areas or the Nakagawa Canal. Thousands of people injured in the raid died over the following days. After the raid, civilians across Tokyo offered assistance to the refugees. Firemen, police officers and soldiers also tried to rescue survivors trapped under collapsed buildings. Many refugees who had previously lived in slums were accommodated in prosperous parts of the city. Some of these refugees resented the differences in living conditions, prompting riots and looting. Refugee centers were also established in parks and other open areas. Over a million people left the city in the following weeks, with more than 90 percent being accommodated in nearby prefectures. Due to the extent of the damage and the exodus from Tokyo, no attempt was made to restore services to large sections of the city. Aftermath =Casualties= The charred body of a woman who was carrying a child on her back Estimates of the number of people killed in the bombing of Tokyo on 10 March differ. After the raid, 79,466 bodies were recovered and recorded. Many other bodies were not recovered, and the city's director of health estimated that 83,600 people were killed and another 40,918 wounded. The Tokyo fire department put the casualties at 97,000 killed and 125,000 wounded, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department believed that 124,711 people had been killed or wounded. After the war, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey estimated the casualties as 87,793 killed and 40,918 injured. The survey also stated that the majority of the casualties were women, children and elderly people. Frank wrote in 1999 that historians generally believe that there were between 90,000 and 100,000 fatalities, but some argue that the number was much higher. For instance, Edwin P. Hoyt stated in 1987 that 200,000 people had been killed and in 2009 Mark Selden wrote that the number of deaths may have been several times the estimate of 100,000 used by the Japanese and United States Governments. The large population movements out of and into Tokyo in the period before the raid, deaths of entire communities and destruction of records mean that it is not possible to know exactly how many died. Most of the bodies which were recovered were buried in mass graves without being identified. Many bodies of people who had died while attempting to shelter in rivers were swept into the sea and never recovered. Attempts to collect bodies ceased 25 days after the raid. The raid also caused widespread destruction. Police records show that 267,171 buildings were destroyed, which represented a quarter of all buildings in Tokyo at the time. This destruction rendered 1,008,005 survivors homeless. Most buildings in the Asakusa, Fukagawa, Honjo, J≈çt≈ç and Shitaya wards were destroyed, and seven other districts of the city experienced the loss of around half their buildings. Parts of another 14 wards suffered damage. Overall, of Tokyo was burned out. The number of people killed and area destroyed was the largest of any single air raid of World War II, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when each raid is considered by itself. The casualties and damage caused by the raid and absenteeism by workers in Tokyo considerably disrupted the Japanese war economy. =Reactions= LeMay and Arnold considered the operation to have been a significant success on the basis of reports made by the airmen involved and the extensive damage shown in photographs taken by reconnaissance aircraft on 10 March. Arnold sent LeMay a congratulatory message which stated that \\"this mission shows your crews have the guts for anything\\". The aircrew who conducted the attack were also pleased with its results. A post-strike assessment by XXI Bomber Command attributed the scale of damage to the firebombing being concentrated on a specific area, with the bombers attacking within a short timeframe, and the strong winds present over Tokyo. Few concerns were raised in the United States during the war about the morality of the 10 March attack on Tokyo or the firebombing of other Japanese cities. These tactics were supported by the majority of decision-makers and American civilians. Historian Michael Howard has observed that these attitudes reflected the limited options to end the war which were available at the time. For instance, both Arnold and LeMay regarded the 10 March raid and subsequent firebombing operations as being necessary to save American lives by bringing the war to a rapid conclusion. President Franklin D. Roosevelt probably also held this view. While Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was aware of LeMay's tactics and troubled by the lack of public reaction in the United States to the firebombing of Tokyo, he permitted these operations to continue until the end of the war. The raid was followed by similar attacks against Nagoya on the night of 11/12 March, Osaka in the early hours of 14 March, Kobe on 17/18 March and Nagoya again on 18/19 March. An unsuccessful night precision raid was also conducted against an aircraft engine factory in Nagoya on 23/24 March. The firebombing attacks ended only because XXI Bomber Command's stocks of incendiaries were exhausted. The attacks on Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe during March burned out over of the cities. The number of people killed in Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe were much lower than those in 10 March attack on Tokyo with fewer than 10,000 fatalities in each operation. The lower casualties were, in part, the result of better preparations by the Japanese authorities which had resulted from a realization that they had greatly under-estimated the threat posed by firebombing. The Japanese government initially attempted to suppress news of the extent of the 10 March raid, but later used it for propaganda purposes. A communique issued by the Imperial Headquarters on 10 March stated that only \\"various places within the city were set afire\\". However, rumors of the devastation rapidly spread across the country. In a break from the usual practice of downplaying the damage caused by air attacks, the Japanese Government encouraged the media to emphasize the extensive scale of the destruction in an attempt to motivate anger against the United States. Stories about the attack were on the front page of all Japanese newspapers on 11 March. Reporting focused on the perceived immorality of the attack and the number of B-29s which had been destroyed. Subsequent newspaper reports made little reference to the scale of casualties, and the few photos which were published showed little physical damage. When the Japanese Government's official broadcaster Radio Tokyo reported the attack it was labeled \\"slaughter bombing\\". Other radio broadcasts focused on B-29 losses and the claimed desire of Japanese civilians to continue the war. American newspaper reports focused on the physical damage to Tokyo, made little reference to casualties and did not include estimates of the death toll. This resulted from the content of USAAF communiques and reports rather than censorship. The attack considerably damaged the morale of Japanese civilians, with it and the other firebombing raids in March convincing most that the war situation was worse than their government had admitted. The Japanese Government responded with a combination of repression, including heavy penalties for people accused of disloyalty or spreading rumors, and a propaganda campaign focused on restoring confidence in the country's air and civil defense measures. These measures were generally unsuccessful. Few steps were taken to improve Tokyo's defenses after the raid. The majority of the 10th Air Division's senior officers were sacked or reassigned as punishment for the unit's failure on 10 March. Only 20 aircraft were sent to Tokyo to reinforce the 10th Air Division, and these were transferred elsewhere two weeks later when no further attacks were made against the capital. From April, the Japanese reduced their attempts to intercept Allied air raids to preserve aircraft to contest the expected invasion of Japan. The 1st Antiaircraft Division remained active until the end of the war in August 1945. The Japanese military never developed adequate defenses against night air raids, with the night fighter force remaining ineffective and many cities not being protected by antiaircraft guns. Between April and mid-May XXI Bomber Command mainly focused on attacking airfields in southern Japan in support of the invasion of Okinawa. From 11 May until the end of the war the B-29s conducted day precision bombing attacks when weather conditions were favorable, and night firebombing raids against cities at all other times. Further incendiary attacks were conducted against Tokyo, with the final taking place on the night of 25/26 May. By this time, 50.8 percent of the city had been destroyed and more than 4million people left homeless. Further heavy bomber raids against Tokyo were judged to not be worthwhile, and it was removed from XXI Bomber Command's target list. By the end of the war, 75 percent of the sorties conducted by XXI Bomber Command had been part of firebombing operations. =Remembrance= The Dwelling of Remembrance memorial in Yokoamicho Park Following the war the bodies which had been buried in mass graves were exhumed and cremated. The ashes were interred in a charnel house located in Sumida's Yokoamicho Park which had originally been established to hold the remains of 58,000 victims of the 1923 earthquake. A Buddhist service has been conducted to mark the anniversary of the raid on 10 March each year since 1951. A number of small neighborhood memorials were also established across the affected area in the years after the raid. 10 March was designated Tokyo Peace Day by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly in 1990. Few other memorials were erected to commemorate the attack in the decades after the war. Efforts began in the 1970s to construct an official Tokyo Peace Museum to mark the raid, but the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly canceled the project in 1999. Instead, the Dwelling of Remembrance memorial to civilians killed in the raid was built in Yokoamicho Park. This memorial was dedicated in March 2001. The citizens who had been most active in campaigning for the Tokyo Peace Museum established the privately funded Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage, which opened in 2002. As of 2015, this center was the main repository of information in Japan about the firebombing raids. A small section of the Edo- Tokyo Museum also covers the air raids on Tokyo. The academic Cary Karacas has stated that a reason for the low-profile official commemoration of the attack in Japan is that the government does not want to acknowledge \\"that it was Japan who initiated the first-ever air raids on Asia‚Äôs cities\\". Karacas argues that the Japanese Government prefers to focus on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as commemoration of these attacks \\"reinforces the Japanese-as-victim stereotype\\". In 2007 a group of survivors of the 10 March raid and bereaved families launched a lawsuit seeking compensation and an apology for the Japanese Government's actions regarding the attack. As part of the case, it was argued that the raid had been a war crime and the Japanese Government had acted wrongly by agreeing to elements of the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco which waived the right to seek compensation for such actions from the US Government. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Japanese Government had violated the post-war constitution by compensating the military victims of the raid and their families, but not civilians. The Japanese Government argued that it did not have an obligation to compensate the victims of air raids. In 2009 the Tokyo District Court found in favor of the government. Since that time, a public campaign has advocated for the Japanese Government to pass legislation to provide compensation to civilian survivors of the raid. =Historiography= Many historians have stated that the 10 March raid on Tokyo was a military success for the United States, and marked the start of the most effective period of air raids on Japan. For instance, the USAAF official history judged that the attack fully met LeMay's objectives, and it and the subsequent firebombing raids shortened the war. More recently, Tami Davis Biddle noted in The Cambridge History of the Second World War that \\"the Tokyo raid marked a dramatic turn in the American air campaign in the Far East; following on the heels of many months of frustration, it loosed the full weight of American industrial might on the faltering Japanese\\". Mark Lardas has written that 10 March operation was only the second genuinely successful raid on Japan (after an attack against an aircraft factory on 19 January), and \\"LeMay's decision to switch from precision bombardment to area incendiary missions and to conduct the incendiary missions from low altitudes\\" was the most important factor in the eventual success of the strategic bombing campaign. The Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage Historians have also discussed the significance of the raid in the USAAF's transition from an emphasis on precision bombing to area bombing. Conrad C. Crane has observed that \\"the resort to fire raids marked another stage in the escalation towards total war and represented the culmination of trends begun in the air war against Germany\\". Kenneth P. Werrell noted that the firebombing of Japanese cities and the atomic bomb attacks \\"have come to epitomize the strategic bombing campaign against Japan. All else, some say, is a prelude or tangential\\". Historians such as Biddle, William W. Ralph and Barrett Tillman have argued that the decision to change to firebombing tactics was motivated by Arnold and LeMay's desire to prove that the B-29s were effective, and that a strategic bombing force could be a war-winning military arm. British historian Max Hastings shares this view, and has written that the circumstances in which XXI Bomber Command shifted to area attacks in 1945 mirrored those which led Bomber Command to do the same from 1942. Like the bombing of Dresden, the bombing of Tokyo on 10 March 1945 is used as an example by historians and commentators who criticize the ethics and practices of the Allied strategic bombing campaigns. Concerns initially raised regarding these two raids in the years after World War II have over time evolved into widely-held doubts over the morality and effectiveness of the campaigns. For instance, Selden argues that the attack on Tokyo marked the beginning of an American \\"approach to warfare that targets entire populations for annihilation\\". As part of his general critique of Allied area bombing raids on German and Japanese cities, the philosopher A. C. Grayling judged that the 10 March raid was \\"unnecessary and disproportionate\\". Some commentators believe that racism motivated the decision to use firebombing tactics, in contrast to the USAAF's greater emphasis on precision bombing in its air campaign against Germany. Werrell has written that while racism may have influenced this, \\"many other factors were involved, which, I would submit, were more significant\\". Frank has reached similar conclusions. He also argues that the USAAF would have used firebombing tactics in Europe had German cities been as vulnerable to fire as Japanese cities were and intelligence on the German war economy been as lacking as it was on the Japanese war production facilities. Tillman has written that area bombing was the only viable tactic available to the USAAF at the time given the failure of the precision bombing campaign. After the bombing, Emperor Hirohito toured the destroyed portions on 18 March. Historians' views of the effects of this experience on him differ. F.J. Bradley states that the visit convinced Hirohito that Japan had lost the war. Tillman has written that the raid had no effect on the Emperor, and Frank argues that Hirohito supported continuing the war until mid-1945.

Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions. Origin The nomen Rusticelius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in the diminutive suffixes -illus and -ellus. It appears to be derived from rusticellus, clownish, probably a diminutive of rusticus, rural or unsophisticated, rustic.Chase, p. 124.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. rusticus. Praenomina The chief praenomina of the Rusticelii were Gaius, Lucius, Aulus, and Quintus, all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Other praenomina are found infrequently, including Marcus and Publius, otherwise common names.

He has many wealthy followers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and China. In 1999, he moved to the United States and now lives with his family in Pasadena, California. In addition to his Vajradhara claim, Yi also says that he is the second reincarnation of Vimalakirti and has performed miracles. Art In March 2015, \\"Ink Lotus\\", a painting by Yi, sold for $16.5 million at public auction. In 2012, two paintings by Yi sold for $230,000 and $330,000. Greg Brown, an art appraiser with an emphasis in Asian art, expressed puzzlement at the sudden increase in value of works by Yi. Greg Brown was quoted by LAist as suggesting that followers of Yi were purchasing his art. A spokesman for Yi said that profits from sale of Yi's artwork were donated to charity. In 2011, the International Art Museum of America opened in San Francisco, California. It originally only featured works by Yi. There is also a H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III Cultural and Art Museum in Covina, California, whose mission is \\"to promote the superb accomplishments of an American with outstanding talent, H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III, by displaying His achievements in culture, literature, philosophy, art, science, technology, and other fields.\\" Awards and lobbying He has been praised by several United States politicians, including the late Congressman Tom Lantos and Los Angeles County supervisors Hilda Solis and Michael D. Antonovich. Congresswoman Judy Chu presented a certificate to Yi in the past, but has said that she is \\"deeply disappointed\\" that the certificate \\"given under a different name and different circumstances [to Yi], is being used to mislead people.\\" In June 2011 former Congressman Lester L. Wolff presented Yi and former Congressman Ben Gilman with the World Peace Prize. According to public records, Yi's followers have spent $120,000 lobbying members of Congress to pass resolutions honoring Yi and his family. In 2008, the International Buddhism Sangha Association paid lobbyist Robin Raphel $10,000 to arrange for Congresswoman Corrine Brown to introduce a resolution recognizing Yi as the \\"true incarnation of the primordial Buddha\\". Chinese government The Chinese government has said that Yi is wanted for fraud, to the value of 60.8 million renminbi. A warrant was issued by Interpol for Yi's arrest, which was withdrawn in 2008. According to a spokesman for Yi, both people who have accused him of fraud have withdrawn their claims. Peter Schey of the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, who acted as Yi's lawyer, has stated the Chinese government levelled the charges against Yi for political reasons. According to the Chinese government tabloid Global Times, on September 10 2013, police in Changchun, Jilin, suspended an \\"illegal\\" religious gathering of over 100 people whose visiting preacher was affiliated with Yi.

He spent many years as an assistant engineer for the city of Boston. In 1908 he began working at the office of John Cheney, a bridge builder. Wilson eventually started his own engineering business. Political career From 1913 to 1916, Wilson was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. From 1917 to 1918 he represented the Norfolk and Suffolk District in the Massachusetts Senate. On July 18, 1918 he was appointed by Boston Mayor Andrew James Peters to serve as the city's Building Commissioner. On April 3, 1922 Wilson was appointed by Governor Channing H. Cox to succeed the deceased Edwin Upton Curtis as Boston's police commissioner. He was reappointed by Governor Alvan T. Fuller in 1927. During his later years as commissioner, Wilson fought with Mayor James Michael Curley and District Attorney William J. Foley, who believed that there was a great deal of corruption in city government. In 1930, the head of BPD's liquor and vice raiding squad, Oliver Garrett, was convicted on conspiracy charges. Massachusetts Attorney General Joseph E. Warner found that Wilson had not taken part in any corruption, but faulted him for not discovering the corruption, negligence, and incompetency within his department and for awarding Garrett a fraudulent pension. Governor Frank G. Allen demanded Wilson's resignation, but he refused to quit. On May 5, 1930, the Massachusetts Governor's Council voted unanimously to remove Wilson \\"for the better protection of the public welfare\\".

He inherited a line of steamships for passenger, cargo and mail services that he greatly expanded to operate between southern France, Corsica, Italy, Spain and Algeria. Later the company ran into difficulty with growing competition, and after his death the ships were sold off. Background Joseph Val√©ry was born in 1828 in Bastia, Corsica. His father was Jean-Mathieu Val√©ry. The Compagnie Valery fr√®res was founded on 9 November 1840 in Bastia by the brothers Jean-Mathieu and Joseph Val√©ry. The brothers were from Poretta-Brando, from a family of sailors of Cap Corse. They established the first line served by a steamship between Bastia, Corsica, and Livorno, then in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1843 the limited company Joseph et Fr√®res Val√©ry was founded with five ships: T√©l√©graph, Golo, Ambassadeur Pozzo di Borgo, Mar√©chal Sebastiani and Letizia. The company offered two return trips per week from Marseille to Bastia and Marseille to Ajaccio. In 1845 the Compagnie Val√©ry placed an order with the shipyard of La Ciotat for the steamship Bonaparte, an innovative design with an iron hull and a propeller. Construction started that year, but was long and difficult. The Bonaparte was launched on 17 January 1847. The trials gave excellent results, with much lower fuel consumption per horsepower per hour than paddle boats. On 19 October 1847 the Bonaparte collided with the Comte de Paris during the night and sank. Between 1840 and 1883 forty-six ships flew the flag of the Compagnie Val√©ry. In 1850 Valery Freres took over the dispatch service abandoned by the French government's postal packet boats. Shipowner Shipwreck of the packet boat La Louise at the entry of the port of Bastia on 23 February 1860 Jean-Mathieu Val√©ry died in 1854 and Jean Joseph Val√©ry became the partner of his uncle Joseph. The company became the Compagnie Maritime Valery Fr√®res & Fils. The company provided postal service between Marseille and Corsica. In 1856 Val√©ry was named president of the Bastia Chamber of Commerce. In 1856 the fleet was enlarged with the addition of the Ajaccio, Bastia, Progr√®s, Industrie, Louise, Jean-Mathieu, Insulaire and G√©n√©rale Abbatucci. The 150 horsepower / ship Roi J√©r√¥me was built for the company in 1861 in Scotland. It was renamed the Comte Joseph Valery in 1877. Val√©ry married Hortense Piccioni. Their daughter Marie Antoinette Val√©ry (c. 1858‚Äì1940) married Jean Casimir de Galard de Brassac de B√©arn (1852‚Äì1910). In 1861 the elder Joseph Val√©ry died and his nephew Joseph became the sole manager of the Compagnie des Paquebots de la M√©diterran√©e. Joseph Val√©ry established himself in Paris as one of the leaders of French maritime trade. He became master of the Grand Orient de France Freemason lodge \\"la parfaite harmonie fran√ßaise\\" in Bastia. He was made a papal count by Pope Pius IX. Under Val√©ry the fleet expanded from 12 to 33 ships, and the capital from 120,000 to 12 million francs. The company provided cabotage service to the Corsican ports, operated lines between Corsica and Marseile, Nice, Toulon and Sardinia as well as links from Marseille to Tunisia, Algeria and Spain. Valery used his wealth to build a splendid mansion in Bastia, demolished in the 1950s. 500 franc action for the Compagnie Maritime Valery Fr√®res & Fils, 1872 An agreement was made on 10 July 1862 between Val√©ry and √âdouard Vandal(fr), Director General of Posts, for the company to run a weekly postal service between Nice and alternately Ajaccio and Bastia. An imperial decree of 25 April 1863 conformed this postal service concession. The fleet was also granted the concession by the Italian state to provide the postal service between Genoa, Italy and Sicily, although all the ships flew the French flag. After 18 years of monopoly, in 1868 the Compagnie Fraissinet became a competitor. On 11 June 1870 Val√©ry's company won the concession for postal service and transport between France and Algeria, and on the eastern part of the Algerian coast. After the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870 Fran√ßois Morelli became director of food and restaurants for Val√©ry's company. He became one of Val√©ry's main partners. In 1873 the company lost the Corsican postal service concession to the Fraissinet company. Politician Val√©ry was a general councilor for Bastia. He served as vice-consul of Spain, Austria and Greece and consul of Portugal. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, and received many foreign decorations. Val√©ry was also the Bonapartist general councillor for the canton of Brando from 1871 to 1879. Val√©ry was elected Senator of Corsica on 30 January 1876 by 288 votes out of 476. During his campaign he was given strong support by Eug√®ne Rouher, Denis Gavini and Jean- Charles Abbatucci. His election was validated despite the fact that he had given senatorial electors free transport and food on one of his boats, from where they went under escort to vote. In the senate he sat with the Bonapartist Appel au peuple group. He voted for the dissolution of the chamber demanded by the ministry of de Broglie.. After Val√©ry was elected a senator his company was poorly managed. Due to bad health he had to spend the winter in Florence, where he died on 26 March 1879. He was aged 58. Legacy On 22 June 1879 Val√©ry was replaced in the senate by Joseph Marie Pi√©tri. Morelli became president of the company. Val√©ry's son and heir Jean-Mathieu squandered the company's capital recklessly. In 1878 the company had 27 steamboats. 12 of these were sold by a private deed of 6 December 1880 to the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique to clear a bond debt. By 1883 the company was ruined and Jean- Mathieu Val√©ry went into exile in Venezuela. The Val√©ry family abandoned its business and in March 1883 sold the remaining 11 ships of its fleet to a company organized by Morelli with other Corsican capitalists to fight the Compagnie Fraissinet hegemony on Corsica. Valery's tomb, in Carrara marble is in a mausoleum a few hundred yards from the village of Erbalunga, near the Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel chapel.

The wing is assigned to Air Combat Command's Ninth Air Force. The wing's mission is to provide, project and sustain combat-ready aircraft in conventional and anti-radiation suppression of enemy air defenses, strategic attack, counter-air, air interdiction, joint maritime operations and combat search-and-rescue missions. History Group P-51D at ShawAircraft is North American P-51D-30-NA Mustang serial 44-74558 at Shaw Field. Note the postwar buzz number on the fuselage, and \\"20th Fighter Group\\" written on the tail cap. The 20th Fighter Wing was established on 20 July 1947 at Shaw Field, South Carolina and activated on 15 August. Upon its activation, the 20th commanded the functions of both the support groups as well as the flying 20th Fighter Group and the squadrons assigned to it. On 26 August 1948, the wing's 20th Airdrome Group was discontinued and its elements became realigned under the 20th Air Base Group. On 15 December 1993, the flight line at RAF Upper Heyford was closed. The wing moved without personnel and equipment from the UK to South Carolina on 1 January 1994, inheriting the personnel and equipment of the 363d Fighter Wing. Two F-16s from the wing collided during a training flight on 15 October 2009. One F-16, piloted by Captain Lee Bryant, was able to land safely at Shaw.The Washington Post, \\"Plane Search Expands; Debris Seen in Atlantic\\", 17 October 2009. The other plane, piloted by Captain Nicholas Giglio, 32, apparently crashed into the ocean. Authorities believe that Giglio was killed instantly in the collision and did not eject.Collins, Jeffrey, \\"Missing F-16 pilot had no chance to eject\\", Military Times, 18 October 2009. An accident investigation board determined that the crash was caused by pilot error. The board stated that Giglio was flying too fast and was not paying adequate attention as he attempted to rejoin Bryant's aircraft for the return flight to Shaw.Rolfsen, Bruce, \\"Report: Pilot error caused F-16s to collide\\", Military Times, 11 January 2010. Units The 20th Fighter Wing is composed of four groups each with specific functions. The Operations Group controls all flying and airfield operations. The Maintenance Group performs maintenance of aircraft, ground equipment and aircraft components. The Mission Support Group has a wide range of responsibilities,a few of its functions are Security, Civil Engineering, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support.

Trower (1849-1911) was an American businessman. He was among the wealthiest African Americans in Pennsylvania and possibly the United States at the time of his death. Early life and career Trower was born on October 3, 1849 in Eastville, Northampton County, Virginia. His parents, Luke and Anna M. Trower, were free black farmers and of mixed white, Native American and African American descent. From age 16 to 21, Trower worked on the farm with his family, saving all that he could. All through his early life young Trower was hobbled with the necessity of servicing his family's debt. By the time he was 21 he had saved enough to lift this burden from his family and he felt free to go in search of a fortune. He presented his mother with the deed of the farm and bade her goodbye. At that time, the tide of immigration had already set in from the Virginia plantations toward the cities and young Trower drifted with it in the direction of Baltimore. There was $52 surplus after the farm was paid for and with this sum Trower, wholly inexperienced in the difficulties and dangers of city life, landed in Baltimore. Trower was fortunate there in meeting the Mack family, with whom he made his home during the larger part of the time that he was in Baltimore. They gave him advice which proved of great value to him in his later life. While he was in Baltimore he obtained work in a restaurant as an oyster-opener and soon began, in spite of the small salary he received there, to accumulate a small capital. Partly because he believed he could better his condition in a Northern city and partly led by mere desire to see more of the world, he determined in 1870 to leave Baltimore and go to Philadelphia. Business success Trower decided to settle in Germantown, one of the more wealthy and prosperous quarters of the city, and with the little capital that he had gotten together, he opened a restaurant. He found a modest place in Chelton Avenue in the neighborhood of the Philadelphia and Reading depot. This business seems to have prospered from the beginning. Very soon, Trower was doing, in addition to his restaurant business, a very respectable trade as a caterer. He won the favor of the fashionable people of Germantown and his increasing trade forced him rapidly into a larger and more lucrative business. Within two blocks of his restaurant stood the old Germantown Savings Fund building. Fortunately for Trower, this building was left vacant at this time, the bank having just completed a new building into which it established itself. There was a demand for a first- class caterer's establishment in Germantown. Trower had succeeded in winning the goodwill of some of the wealthy citizens and, with their encouragement, he purchased and refitted the Savings Fund building and made out of it, at a cost of $25,000, a first-class caterer's establishment. He was now fairly on his feet in a business way and began to make money rapidly. It was at this time that he made the acquaintance and won the goodwill of some of the officers of William Cramp & Sons, a shipbuilding company. Soon after this, in 1889, Trower had his first opportunity to cater for the Cramps. The firm employed him steadily after that time. Many of the world's most renowned war vessels were served upon their trial trips by Trower, among them the Yorktown, the Philadelphia, the Vesuvius, the New York, the Iowa, the Columbia, the Baltimore, the Minneapolis, the Newark, the Brooklyn, the Variag, the Retvizan, the Mecidiye, the Colorado and the Pennsylvania. Trower's place of business was one of the most complete of its kind in the country. On the first floor were his offices, dining-room, delivery department and ice cream plant, which was run by electricity. On the second floor was a reception-room and a dining hall, which seated 150 guests, and the baking department. On the third floor were the storeroom and laundry. In the basement were china closets and storage-rooms. In his office he employed five clerks, all of whom were young African American men and women. The culinary, ice cream, baking, and delivery service departments employed 20 people. A large element of Trower's success must be attributed to the fact that he constantly sought to improve and extend his business. His trade was not limited to Germantown and Philadelphia, but extended throughout the state. On several occasions he served large orders in the South and West. At the time when John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, was Postmaster General, Trower served him as caterer in a reception which was at that time one of the most elaborate that had ever been given in Washington, D.C. In addition to his caterer's trade he did a lucrative real estate business. He owned considerable property both in Germantown and Ocean City, New Jersey, where he had his summer residence. Personal life Outside of his business, Trower was a member of the well known Cherry Street Baptist Church. He was a member of the board of deacons, and of the board of trustees, and superintendent of the Sunday school. The National Baptist Convention made him the National Baptist Superintendent of the World. He was the President of the Sunday School Convention of Pennsylvania, a position he held for many years. Trower contributed greatly to the building up of a number of Baptist churches of his city and state. His advice was frequently sought in matters of finance and church policy in the Baptist denomination. He was president of the Cherry Building and Loan Society, treasurer of the Reliable Mutual Aid and Improvement Company, and treasurer of the Reliable Business Men's Building. He was a member of the board of trustees for the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored People, and member of the board of trustees for the Olive Cemetery. As president of the Pennsylvania Sunday School Convention, it was he who suggested the necessity of the establishment of an Industrial and Theological School in Pennsylvania. He purchased a farm in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and held it in trust until the Baptists of the state were enabled to assume the responsibility of the purchase. Trower was also very active in charitable work. Trower's wife was Miss Matilda Daniels, of Haymarket, Virginia. Matilda Trower took an active part in the business as well as rearing a family of six children. Death Trower died in Philadelphia on April 4, 1911, at the age of 61. His reputed wealth of approximately $1 million placed him among the richest African Americans in Pennsylvania and possibly the United States.

Built in 1926, it housed a fraternal benefit society for French Canadian Roman Catholic immigrants for many years, serving a significant immigrant population in the community. The building is also a prominent example of Classical Revival architecture, designed by a French Canadian immigrant architect, Walter Fontaine. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history The L'Union Saint Jean-Baptist d'Amerique building occupies a prominent site at the northern end of Woonsocket's Monument Square, at the southern corner of Social and Worrall Streets. It is a four-story masonry structure, built mainly out of brick but with a limestone facade. The facade faces west toward Social Street and Monument Square, and is dominated by monumental Corinthian columns and pilasters that rise from the second floor to an entablature beneath the projecting cornice. It is eight bays wide, with the outermost bays housing single sash windows, and the inner ones consisting of paired sash windows recessed between the columns. Panels of garlanded stone separate the windows in the inner bays. The ground-floor storefronts have a modern exterior, which has been applied over the original pressed metal storefronts. L'Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d‚ÄôAmerique (USJB) was founded in 1900 to serve a burgeoning French Canadian immigrant population in New England and the United States, drawn by the prospect of employment in the many textile mills. In Woonsocket, for example, by 1900 fully 60% of the city's population was of French Canadian extraction, and by 1920 it was among the most French cities in the country. The USJB was a national organization which provided a support network for French Canadians, particularly supporting the continuation of French Canadian language and culture; its official language was French, and its membership was required to be Roman Catholic. The organization was originally headquartered in a building on Clinton Street, and had this building erected as its headquarters in 1926. It maintained its headquarters here until 1991, when it merged with Catholic Family Life Insurance.

The river drains the fertile Hanapepe Valley, a region that was historically used for growing rice, taro, coffee, and sugarcane. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the valley attracted Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino immigrant workers, many of whom started their own farms or businesses. More recently, the Hanapepe Valley was used for filming parts of the 1993 Steven Spielberg film Jurassic Park. Near its mouth in Hanapepe, the river passes under the Hanapepe Swinging Bridge. The footbridge was built in 1911 to provide Hanapepe residents with a way to cross the river, and was restored in 1992 after Hurricane Iniki.

Kashuv explained that he wanted to learn the \\"physical mechanics\\" of guns and how to defend himself, as well as to \\"show people it‚Äôs people that are the issue, not guns.\\" Marjory Stoneman Douglas High history teacher Greg Pittman said the gesture was in poor taste, which Kashuv denied. He said other students told him that Pittman called him the \\"next Hitler\\" while discussing the photo. Kashuv is a supporter of the Republican Party. He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, endorsing Trump's ideas about immigration, the Trump wall, and Trump's \\"America First\\" approach. Kashuv was initially guided by conservative commentators Ben Shapiro and Guy Benson. Kashuv has also worked for Ron DeSantis' campaign for the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election. By March 2018, Kashuv was in the process of producing a mobile phone application, ReachOut, which aims to let students who have emotional struggles to ask for help. In April 2018, Kashuv criticized CNN for being biased because one of their contributors, Joan Walsh, had liked a tweet by Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. In July 2018, Kashuv gave a speech at the 2018 National Western Conservative Summit. Kashuv also gave a speech in April 2019 at the yearly meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA). The Miami Herald in July 2018 wrote that the conservative Second Amendment supporter Kashuv had \\"gained a national following as a counterweight to the March For Our Lives\\" movement. Associated Press in February 2019 described Kashuv as \\"the most prominent conservative voice among the students\\" who had survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. As of June 2019, Kashuv has amassed over 300,000 followers on Twitter. = Turning Point USA = Kashuv became director of high school outreach of the conservative group Turning Point USA and gave speeches about gun rights, including at Princeton University. Kashuv invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to address Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, but the school did not permit the activity. Kashuv helped to plan the organization's 2018 High School Leadership Summit for over 800 students, and was lauded by Fox News in July 2018 as \\"a role model for young conservatives across the country.\\" That month, Kirk described Kashuv as a \\"a national spokesperson for one of the most controversial and divisive issues of our time,\\" and as \\"probably the most hated pro-gun advocate at the time besides Dana Loesch,\\" a spokesperson of the NRA. He resigned from Turning Point in May 2019, hours after former classmates threatened to make public screenshots of racist remarks Kashuv had made. Kashuv denied that his resignation was related to his controversial remarks. =Washington, D.C. meetings= Kashuv with President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump in the Oval Office in 2018 Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Michael Gruen, a 19-year old \\"influencer marketer,\\" noticed Kashuv's posts on Twitter and approached him offering to help him get his message out. With the help of conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, meetings on Capitol Hill were set up for Kashuv in March 2018. The trip was mostly planned on short notice, with Kashuv reacting: \\"I never really wanted to get into politics.\\" During his visit, Kashuv met with President Trump and his wife Melania Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, two Democratic senators (Chris Murphy and Chuck Schumer), three Republican senators (Orrin Hatch, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz), Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, and CNN's Jim Acosta. In April 2018, Kashuv met with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and discussed their support for the Second Amendment. =Gun rights views= Kashuv supports the Second Amendment. Before the mass shooting, Kashuv supported zero gun restrictions, but after the mass shooting, Kashuv changed his position to favor much \\"stricter background checks and mental evaluations\\" for gun purchases, but still disagrees with banning any type of gun. He also does not support restrictions on high capacity magazines. Regarding the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Kashuv did not blame gun laws, instead blaming the failures of law enforcement for failing to either stop the gunman during the shooting, or even identify the gunman as a threat before the shooting happened. Kashuv endorses the idea that \\"the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun\\"; he has advocated for schools to eliminate gun- free zones, and for policies allowing teachers and school staff to be armed. Kashuv supports the Senate's bipartisan STOP School Violence Act, which provides federal funds to develop an \\"anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence,\\" improve \\"school security infrastructure,\\" and train students, school staff and law enforcement to prevent violence. Kashuv said he agrees with fellow student activists David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez that gun deaths and school shootings need to be stopped, \\"and that shouldn‚Äôt be delegitimized, ever\\". Kashuv's stated solutions to improve the situation differ from Hogg and Kasky's, but he has called for a debate with them to find \\"common middle ground.\\" Kashuv has also said he felt frustrated that he was not invited to speak at the March for Our Lives event, suggesting it was because of his political views. Kashuv has described himself as speaking \\"calmly and logically\\" in contrast to \\"inflammatory language\\" used by other student activists. Kashuv believed that the \\"initial movement, in its purest form\\" coming out of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting \\"was amazing.\\" He said that \\"It got corrupted because now it's represented as anti- gun and anti-NRA.\\" He described March for Our Lives as being \\"anti-Republican\\" and said that the NRA does not have as much \\"evil power\\" over politicians as their critics believe. Kashuv himself was criticized by the students in Never Again MSD for his views on gun rights. =Criticism by Kurt Eichenwald= In late March 2018, Kashuv was criticized online by Newsweek writer Kurt Eichenwald. In response, Kashuv called for a boycott of MSNBC, since Eichenwald had stated that he was an MSNBC contributor on his Twitter biography, although Eichenwald had actually not been an MSNBC contributor since a month prior. One of MSNBC's sponsors, Proactiv, removed its advertisements from the network in response. Eichenwald apologized to Kashuv, claiming that his criticism of Kashuv was a case of mistaken identity because he had taken Kashuv to be another teenager who had frequently insulted him before. Kashuv accepted Eichenwald's apology. In April 2018, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro published emails Eichenwald sent to him which included a statement that Kashuv was \\"in desperate need of psychiatric help.\\" In those emails, Eichenwald stated that he was a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, but Vanity Fair issued a statement saying that Eichenwald was not a contributor at the time. Personal life Kashuv's parents emigrated to the United States from Israel in the 1990s before he was born. He grew up in Parkland, Florida. Kashuv considers himself to be politically conservative. He and his parents are Jewish. In 2019, he said he pays weekly visits to the synagogue. In April 2018, a student at Lincoln Southeast High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, who admired Kashuv's for expressing views about gun rights contrary to so many of his classmates, asked Kashuv to her prom. Kashuv turned her down until she received more than 5,000 re-tweets of her posting with the help of Ben Shapiro. Kashuv did not have a tuxedo or airplane fare to get to Nebraska, so she set up a GoFundMe account, which raised the necessary money in two hours. Kashuv accompanied her to her prom, and met with Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts. Racial slurs and inflammatory comments Several of Kashuv's classmates complained on social media and to the press regarding Kashuv's use of inflammatory and racist comments, including racial slurs against African-Americans. Kashuv was accused by his classmates of hypocrisy when he criticized Bill Nye for using vulgarities in a skit regarding climate change on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (Nye had declared: \\"The planet's on fucking fire!\\"), stating that Nye \\"looked like a joke.\\" Screenshots of a Google Doc for a class study guide showed Kashuv writing \\"NIGGER\\" multiple times, discussing \\"JEWISH SLAVES,\\" and declaring that he would \\"fucking make a CSOG map of Douglas and practice\\" (in a supposed reference to the Counter- Strike: Global Offensive shooter game and Stoneman Douglas High School). Text messages reportedly showed Kashuv rating a female student \\"7/10\\" and stating that she \\"goes for niggerjocks.\\"Other sources reporting his exact remarks:   * * On May 22, 2019, Kashuv released a statement about the screenshots and the comments within, admitting to writing the comments when he was 16 years old before the mass shooting occurred. Kashuv called his comments \\"offensive\\", \\"idiotic\\" and \\"inflammatory\\". He also said that the mass shooting changed him as a person, which Harvard decided not to accept. In an interview with The New York Times, Kashuv said that the comments on the Google Doc were made late at night, and that he had \\"said a bunch of anti-Semitic stuff.\\" On June 17, 2019, Kashuv stated that the comments were made \\"months before the shooting,\\" and also said that Harvard University had rescinded its offer of admission as a result of the remarks. Kashuv published a letter by Harvard, which stated that they had considered \\"the qualities of maturity and moral character\\" in their decision. Kashuv has accused unidentified political opponents of having urged Harvard not to accept him. Kashuv has said he would have to reapply to other colleges because it was too late to accept other offers. He had originally intended to take a gap year before matriculating into Harvard.

Formed in October 2011, the group supports the uprising against the Syrian government and aims to build a \\"democratic, civil, and pluralist state\\" in Syria, while opposing any foreign military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.  Ideology and history  During the formation of the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current in October 2011, its founding documents stated that the it \\"adopts the major objectives of the Syrian People's Revolution, for freedom, democracy, dignity and social justice, and is committed to engage in mass action to achieve these objectives.\\" It considered that \\"revolutionary dynamics is about building a democracy from below\\", and advocated for participatory democracy and direct democracy. The Revolutionary Left Current opposes all forms of foreign military intervention in Syria, including by NATO, by the Arab League, by Israel, and by Turkey. The Revolutionary Left Current's founding document also outlined a list of goals for the group and for other Syrian opposition groups, which were to overthrow the Syrian government and establish a \\"Provisional Revolutionary Government\\", dismantle the \\"security infrastructure of the state\\", and election of a Constituent Assembly. In August 2013, the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current condemned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the al-Nusra Front, and amid the Syrian Kurdish‚ÄìIslamist conflict, it \\"reaffirmed its commitment\\" to support self-determination for Kurds in Syria. It also condemned the Syrian National Council for refusing to recognize rights for Kurdish people in Syria. On 23 September 2014, the group condemned the American-led intervention in Syria which began with airstrikes against ISIL, al-Nusra Front, and Ahrar al-Sham in Syria. In the spring of 2016, the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current and Greek leftist groups opened 6 centers in Athens, housing 2,400 Syrian refugees. In September 2016, the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current formed an alliance with the Syrian National Democratic Alliance and the Syrian Democratic Forces on the basis of political decentralization and the establishment of a pluralist democracy in Syria. When the Turkish Armed Forces launched a military operation against the SDF in the Afrin Region on 20 January 2018, the Revolutionary Left Current condemned the operation and announced its support for the SDF in Afrin against Turkey. On 1 May 2019 (International Workers' Day), the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current released a statement condemning the \\"bourgeois regime\\" of Syria and Turkey, and blaming the collapse of the Syrian Revolution on the absence of a \\"revolutionary party\\".

On 18 March 2014, three armed and masked militants announced the formation of the People's Liberation Faction as part of the Syrian Revolutionary Left Current. Fighters of the group were armed with Kalashnikov rifles, PK machine guns, and RPG-7s. The group also used a technical, a mortar, and a DShK heavy machine gun. It cooperated with several local Free Syrian Army-affiliated groups. On 12 April 2014, a unit in the group attempted to redeploy fighters from the Hama Governorate to support other rebel groups in the Battle of Aleppo, when they were stopped at an al- Nusra Front checkpoint. Clashes then ensued and 3 fighters from the People's Liberation Faction were killed. Fighters of the group redeployed to Koban√Æ in order to reinforce the city against an ISIL offensive in September 2014. In late 2014, due to persecution by \\"counter-revolutionary forces\\", the People's Liberation Faction largely suspended its activities in Syria.

Although he was a praised figure at the height of his career, he later lost his reputation. He moved onto experimenting with more ambitious styles motivated by his anti-mainstream sentiments.  Early life  Chikuha was born in Niigata City, Niigata Prefecture as Somekichi in 1878. His father Otake Kuramatsu was a dyer, who also painted under the name Otake Kokuseki. His two brothers, Etsudo and Kokkan both became proliferate painters, and the three of them came to be known as the Otake Brothers.  Career  At the age of four, he learned nanga under Sasada Unseki, and received the pseudonym Chikuha. In 1891, he moved to Toyama where his older brother, Etsudo lived at the time. To make a living, he started working on images for newspapers, and preliminary sketches for medicine advertisements. In 1896, he moved to Tokyo following his younger brother Kokkan who left three years earlier, and became a disciple of Kawabata Gyokusho. He also learned yamato-e techniques of portraiture from Kobori Tomoto, bird-and-flower painting from Kajita Hanko, Kano school line drawing from Hashimoto Gaho. He started sending his works to Kyoshinkai, biennial exhibitions hosted by Nihon Kaiga Kyokai and Inten hosted by Nihon Bijutsuin. Both of these institutions were led by Okakura Tenshin, an influential figure in developing Japanese modern art institutions. Through these submissions and subsequent attention by Tenshin, Chikuha made himself known in the field. However, in 1908, due to political differences among artist groups and movements, Chikuha left Tenshin in anger. The Visit (Otodure) 1910, color on paper - National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo His leave from Tenshin marks the beginning of his most proliferate period, during which he produced his most famous works. This includes The Visit (Otodure), his most known work which won nito sho (highest prize) in Bunten in 1910 (currently at National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo). He also won the santo sho (second highest prize) in 1909, nito sho in 1911. Although he continued to submit works to Bunten until 1918, he did not win any further awards. Due to his frustration, he decided to run for the general election in 1915, for a position in the House of Representatives. He did not get elected, and ended with much debt. It is this failure that lead him to decline in his later years. In order to pay back his debt, Chikuha produced hundreds of Sun, on sea waves, which caused his reputation to fall. He also kept on painting artistically vigorous works, moving from detailed portraits and sceneries to vivid abstracts. Starting the winter of 1935, Chikuha suffered from bronchial asthma until he died at his home in Hongo, Tokyo on June 2 at the age of 59.  Works  His works are in stored in many Japanese museums, including National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo (Otodure (The Visit)), the Miyagi Museum of Art (Tsuki no Uruoi / Taiyo no Netsu / Hoshi no Tsumetasa). In particular, the Niigata Prefectural Museum of Modern Art owns more than twenty works including Aogiri.Êñ∞ÊΩüÁúåÁ´ãËøë‰ª£ÁæéË°ìÈ§®„ÉªÊñ∞ÊΩüÁúåÁ´ã‰∏á‰ª£Â≥∂ÁæéË°ìÈ§®Âπ¥Â†±2013. \\"‰∫ãÊ•≠Â†±Âëä ÂèéÈõÜ‰øùÂ≠ò.\\" 12.https://kinbi.pref.niigata.lg.jp/pdf/nenpo/an2013.pdf In the United States, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Akan Genshirin (Akan Primeval Forest)) and Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rakujo (Fall of a Castle)) possess his works.

White (November 1, 1817 ‚Äì May 7, 1916) was an American suffragist, philanthropist, and social reformer. She was the first president of the New Hampshire Woman's Suffrage Association, and was well known for her many years, along with her husband, Nathaniel White, of Concord, New Hampshire, in works of philanthropy and reform. Early years and education Armenia Smith Aldrich was born in Mendon, Massachusetts, November 1, 1817, daughter of John and Harriet (Smith) Aldrich. Her direct paternal line of ancestry in the United States began with George Aldrich, who, with his wife Catherine, came from Derbyshire, England, in 1631, and in 1663 was among the early settlers of Mendon, removing there from Braintree, Massachusetts. Jacob Ahlrich, son of George, married Huldah, daughter of Ferdinando Thayer, and was the father of Moses, born in 1690. Moses Aldrich was a preacher of the Quakers in Rhode Island. He travelled as an approved minister, not only in the colonies later forming the original States of the American Union, but in the West Indies and in England. He married in 1711 Hannah White. Judge Caleb Aldrich, son of Moses, is mentioned in the History of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, as father of Naaman and grandfather of John Aldrich, all of Smithfield, Rhode Island. Naaman was the father of John Aldrich, who was the father of Mrs. White. White's maternal ancestry included three Mayflower Pilgrims, Edward Doty, Francis Cooke, and Stephen Hopkins, also Mr. Hopkins's second wife, Elizabeth, and their daughter Damaris, who both came with him to Plymouth, Massachusetts. White's mother, Harriet Smith Aldrich, was born, as recorded in Smithfield, February 21, 1795. She was a daughter of Samuel Smith and his wife, Hope Doten. Her parents were married at Plymouth, May 31, 1791, and moved to Smithfield. Samuel was a Revolutionary War soldier, born in Smithfield, enlisting in the American army at the age of sixteen years. The Doty-Doten genealogy shows that Hope Doten, born in Plymouth, in 1765, was daughter of James and Elizabeth (Kempton) Doten, and was descended from Edward Doty and his wife. Faith Clark, through John and Elizabeth (Cooke) Doty, Isaac' and Martha (Faunce) Doten, and Isaac* and Mary (Lanman) Doten, Isaac being father of James and grandfather of Hope Doten, White's maternal grandmother. Elizabeth, wife of John Doty (or Doten), was the daughter of Jacob Cooke (son of Francis') and his wife Damaris, daughter of Stephen Hopkins and his wife Elizabeth. After the marriage of John Aldrich and Harriet Smith, they moved from Smithfield to Mendon. In 1830, Mr. and Mrs. John Aldrich removed from Mendon, to Boscawen, New Hampshire. Their daughter, Armenia, was educated in the public schools. Career White Farm On November 1, 1836, on her nineteenth birthday, she married Nathaniel White, a young stage driver six years her senior, a native of Lancaster, New Hampshire. For four years after marriage, the Whites boarded in Concord, New Hampshire, his business being such as to render housekeeping inexpedient. For eight years thereafter, they kept house on Warren Street. White residence, whose grounds were situated from School to Capitol streets (1894) In 1848, they moved to a home in Concord, which then fronted on School Street, but after the opening of Capitol Street, when the State House was re-modelled, it was enlarged and improved and the entrance changed to Capitol Street. After Nathaniel's death in 1880, White remained, managing the affairs of the large estate left in her hands, and continuing her interest and efforts in the various charitable, benevolent and reform causes and enterprises, in which she had been engaged for many years. (left to right) White residence on Capitol Street; White Memorial Church. (1916) Reared as a Quaker, she espoused the cause of Universalism, then just commanding the attention of people in the community, when making her choice of religious affiliation in Concord, and, with her husband, was active in the movement for the organization of a society and the establishment of. regular worship under that name and faith. Fully believing as did her husband also, in woman‚Äôs right to active participation in religious as well as civil affairs, it was through their influence that women were admitted to membership in this society‚Äîthe first in Concord to admit them. She was soon instrumental in the organization of a woman‚Äôs auxiliary, known as the Ladies‚Äô Social Aid Society, working in aid of the social and material interests of the denomination, of which she was chosen president, holding that position continually until her death, though for the last few years debarred, on account of physical disability, from the performance of its active duties. Throughout her life, working conjointly with her husband, as in other worthy causes, till his decease, and in her own behalf and in his name thereafter, she gave of her time and means, labor, care and devotion, for the welfare of this church, whose house of worship, originally built largely through their material contribution, and more than once re-modelled and improved in good part at their expense, was named, after Mr. White‚Äôs decease, in their honor‚Äî the ‚ÄúWhite Memorial Church.‚Äù She was first and foremost among the women of the city and state in espousing every important cause in the fields of reform and philanthropy, and every movement in which she was interested in, commanded her support in time, money and effort. To the antislavery cause, with her husband, she was earnestly devoted. The temperance movement received their support in New Hampshire; and it was largely through White‚Äôs instrumentality that the New Hampshire Woman‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union was organized, of which she was elected the first president, holding the position, long in an active and later in an honorary capacity. No cause was more dear to her, and none so long and persistently labored for, as that whose object was the enfranchisement of her own sex and the elevation of woman to the plane of political equality with man. She was the pioneer of the woman suffrage movement in New Hampshire. She was the first signer of the call for the first equal suffrage convention in the state, held in Eagle Hall, in Concord, in December 1868, in collaboration with Sarah Piper of Concord. White called the meeting to order and was elected the first president of the New Hampshire Woman Suffrage Association then organized, and held that position, until 1895, when she felt compelled to retire, thereafter holding the position of honorary president. She was a delegate to the American Woman Suffrage Association, organized at Cleveland, Ohio, immediately after the New Hampshire Association was formed, and was vice-president of that association for New Hampshire many years. Mainly through her efforts, supported by her husband, the state legislature, in 1871, made women eligible to serve on school committees, and, in 1878, granted them the right of school suffrage, before any other New England state had accorded them such privilege. White was active in organizing suffrage meetings and very hospitable in entertaining speakers, Lucy Stone, Mary Livermore, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Julia Ward Howe, and many others, having been her guests from time to time. She had in charge the New Hampshire tables at several suffrage bazaars held in Boston, and in various ways contributed to their success. She was a constant and liberal contributor to the New Hampshire Centennial Home for the Aged, the Orphans' Home at Franklin, and the Mercy Home at Manchester. At the age of ninety-three, she still retained the presidency of the Ladies' Social Aid Society. Personal life Nathaniel was born at Lancaster, New Hampshire, February 7, 1811, being a son of Samuel and Sarah (Freeman) White and descendant of William White, an early settler of Essex County, Massachusetts. For a number of years in his youth, he was employed in the Columbian Hotel in Concord. He started in business for himself in 1832, becoming a part owner in the stage route between Concord and Hanover, New Hampshire, later buying the line between Concord and Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1837, in partnership with Captain William Walker, he established himself in the express business, making tri-weekly trips to Boston. Upon the opening of the Concord Railroad in 1842, he became one of the original members of the express company then organized to deliver goods throughout New Hampshire and Canada. In his forty-eight years of business life, he purchased valuable realty in Chicago, hotel property in New Hampshire, and stock in various railroad corporations, banks, manufactories, and other companies, in addition to his interests in the express company and in Concord real estate. He took a deep interest in the establishment of the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane, the State Reform School, the Orphans' Home at Franklin, New Hampshire, to which he gave a generous endowment, and of the Home for the Aged at Concord.

The temple focuses on being an introductory center for beginners to learn Buddhism and aims to provide a space for Americans to practice Buddhism in the comfort of their own culture. It has its roots in Taiwanese Buddhism but identifies with ecumenical Buddhism, or interdenominational Buddhism. Dharma Bum Temple was founded on New Year's Eve in 2006 by a group of three people. It was originally located in Downtown San Diego, where it became popular among locals and college students from the nearby San Diego State University (SDSU). The temple was involved in the founding of the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, Delta Beta Tau. Dharma Bum Temple made headlines in local newspapers in 2017 with its campaign to buy the 1927-built Swedenborgian Church in University Heights, San Diego, which the temple relocated to later that year. Dharma Bum Temple holds free meditation and Buddhism classes for the general public and organizes community service events in the area. The temple is known for directing its members to other Buddhist temples in the area based on the forms of Buddhism that interest the person. The temple routinely hosts guest speakers from various traditions of Buddhism and organizes field trips to other Buddhist temples in the area.  History  = Founding = alt= Dharma Bum Temple was founded by a group who met at a local Buddhist temple in San Diego in 2003. One of the members of the group, Jeffrey Zlotnik, eventually became president of the English-language chapter of the local temple. In 2005, the group went to the Fo Guang Shan monastery in Taiwan to study Buddhism and was invited to open a temple in San Diego under the International Bodhisattva Sangha in 2006. However, due to logistical problems and a lack of funding, the group abandoned the project shortly after opening the temple. Later that year, the group opened its own temple in Downtown San Diego under the name \\"Dharma Bum Center\\", after the 1958 Jack Kerouac book The Dharma Bums. In September 2008, the temple officially changed its name to Dharma Bum Temple. = In Downtown San Diego = Dharma Bum Temple was located in and operated from Downtown San Diego from the end of 2006 to April 2017. When the temple reached maximum capacity in 2008, it attempted to move to a larger location in Downtown San Diego, but returned to the original building when the new location was found to not be suitable. In 2009, the temple acquired a Buddhist gift shop near San Diego State University (SDSU) called Buddha for You at the request of the previous owner, who was elderly and wanted somebody to entrust the store to. Although the gift shop rarely generated profit for Dharma Bum Temple, it played a significant role in the expansion of the temple's community. Due to its proximity to SDSU, Dharma Bum Temple and its services at Buddha for You became popular among college students and the temple eventually started holding regular events on the campus. This included the organization of an SDSU meditation club called the \\"Aztec Dharma Bums\\" and the founding of the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, Delta Beta Tau (ŒîŒíŒ§). Before the temple relocated, its services were divided between its main building in Downtown and the gift shop Buddha for You. The latter hosted two meditation classes a week, attended by about forty participants each. The temple spent five years looking for a place to expand to but was unable to find a suitable location until 2016. = Campaign to buy the Swedenborgian Church = alt=In October 2016, Dharma Bum Temple started a campaign to purchase the Swedenborgian Church in University Heights, San Diego. According to Dharma Bum Temple co-founder Jeffrey Zlotnik, the church was the ideal place to expand to because it was centrally located near several major neighborhoods and districts in San Diego, was free from Downtown San Diego's parking and traffic problems, and was large enough to accommodate the growing congregation. left A developer offered $1.4 million for the church, which Dharma Bum Temple offered to match. However, preference was given to Dharma Bum Temple because the prior owner wanted the church to continue to be used for a spiritual purpose. Although Dharma Bum Temple only had $7,000 at the time, the temple agreed and entered escrow, having to raise $490,000 for the down payment within 108 days. To raise the money, Zlotnik launched a fundraising campaign on Facebook to ask for donations. The campaign did very well, raising $103,800 from 321 donors in its first two weeks. It caught the attention of several local news outlets in San Diego because the temple and its congregation were able to raise the funds so rapidly. Due to the news coverage, several consultants and organizations contacted Zlotnik to ask for fundraising advice. Dharma Bum Temple received the last string of donations needed to make the down payment on February 14, 2017, the final day of the fundraiser. By the end of the campaign, the temple had raised $497,000 from 1,123 donors in 108 days (about $4,600 per day). = Relocation to University Heights = After closing escrow, Dharma Bum Temple officially moved to its new location in University Heights on April 15, 2017. Since relocating, the temple consolidated Dharma Bum Temple and its separate gift shop, Buddha for You, as well as all of the services that were held there into the new larger location. The new temple is expected to have three meditation areas and be able hold up to 300 people at one time.  Services  Dharma Bum Temple service with guest speaker Venerable alt= Dharma Bum Temple focuses on being an introductory center for westerners to learn Buddhism in a culturally approachable way. The temple avoids pressuring its members into cultural Buddhist practices that may make westerners feel uncomfortable, such as chanting and bowing. Members of the temple refer to themselves as \\"Dharma Bums\\". The temple has a policy of welcoming all groups, including other religions. Although it does not identify with any specific school of Buddhism, the temple emphasizes principles of Mahayana Buddhism such as the teachings of the Heart Sutra. Its teachings include overcoming problems and eliminating suffering through meditation and the development of Buddhist principles. Like many temples influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, Dharma Bum Temple stresses the benefit of pursuing the Bodhisattva Path through the cultivation of the Six Mahayana Paramitas. The temple is known for directing members to other Buddhist temples in the San Diego area after they start showing deeper interest in a particular form of the religion after attending Dharma Bum Temple. It regularly hosts guest speakers from various traditions of Buddhism and holds field trips in the summer to other Buddhist temples in San Diego to introduce attendees to their traditions. The temple also offers introductory classes on Buddhism in Spanish. Dharma Bum Temple has a strict \\"no charge\\" policy and its teachers are instructed to never ask for donations or give a sermon on DƒÅna, or giving. According to temple co-founder Jeffrey Zlotnik, this policy is in place to avoid pressuring attendees into giving unwillingly, which he says reduces the value of the practice of generosity. As a result, Dharma Bum Temple services are always free of charge and the temple is run solely off of voluntary donations. The temple's services are attended by a diverse demographic, with its largest demographic being young adult Caucasians. The temple does not actively advertise itself and relies mostly on word of mouth to attract members. Its events are mainly coordinated online through platforms such as Facebook. Dharma Bum Temple focuses on the development of its community around the structure of families, offering individual programs for each age group; including for young children, teenagers, and adults, and has a family program called the \\"Family Sangha\\". Along with traditional Buddhist services, Dharma Bum Temple also hosts a Buddhism based support group called the \\"Recovery Sangha\\". The program combines elements of the traditional Twelve-Step Program with Buddhism and meditation to help drug and alcohol addicts overcome their addictions. The temple hosts multiple Buddhism and meditation classes throughout the week. As of December 2018, its most popular weekly services were attracting around 70 people per class.  Community outreach  = Food redistribution = Dharma Bum Temple operates a weekly feed the homeless program called \\"Food Redistribution\\". The temple and volunteers for the program do not purchase food for the program but instead collect food from stores and farms in the area who would have otherwise thrown it away for not being fresh or being too close to the expiration date. The focus of the program is not just to feed the homeless but also to combat excessive food waste. All food prepared for the Dharma Bum Temple food redistribution program is vegetarian. = Prison outreach = Since 2006, Dharma Bum Temple regularly visits prisons to teach meditation or Buddhism to inmates in San Diego. The program emphasizes Buddhism as a way to develop traits such as wisdom and compassion, rather than being a Buddhist. The goal of the program is to improve the minds of inmates so they can reintegrate into society more smoothly once they are released from prison.  Delta Beta Tau  212x212px In 2015, Dharma Bum Temple started to organize a Buddhist college fraternity at the suggestion of its co-founder Jeffrey Zlotnik, who was in Beta Theta Pi in college. Although the temple originally planned on creating a fraternity and a sorority, it ended up organizing a single co-ed fraternity. The first chapter of the fraternity was founded at San Diego State University (SDSU), which the temple already had a strong presence on. The temple had already been running a meditation club on the campus called \\"The Aztec Dharma Bums\\". Delta Beta Tau (ŒîŒíŒ§) was founded in September 2015 at SDSU as the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, its name was based on the initials of Dharma Bum Temple. The co-ed fraternity was founded on the principles of the Six Paramitas of Mahayana Buddhism. Rules and activities for the fraternity are based on Buddhist principles and to join pledges do community service and attend meditation retreats. In 2017, the fraternity announced plans to start a chapter at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). As of August 20, 2019 the fraternity has initiated 223 active members at its founding chapter at SDSU.

Early life  Nastoh was born to Afghan parents in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada. Hamed Nastoh attended Enver Creek Secondary School in Surrey, British Columbia, along with his brother Abdullah. Nastoh was described as a smart student who liked horror movies, reading, dancing and music. Nastoh, then 14 years old, was bullied in person. In a note he mentions to his parents that high school was terrible for him, everyone in his school would call him \\"gay\\", \\"fag\\", \\"queer\\", \\"four-eyes\\" and \\"big-nose\\" because his average grades were above 90 percent. He left a suicide note saying ‚ÄúI hate myself for doing this to you,‚Äù he wrote to his parents. ‚ÄúI really, really hate myself, but there is no other way out.‚Äù The Nastoh family lived on 143rd Street in Surrey, around 10 kilometres away from the Pattullo Bridge, which spans the Fraser River and links Surrey and New Westminster. At 5:00 pm, Nastoh's mother, father, and younger brother, David, went outside to hang out with a neighbour. Hamed and his older brother, Abdullah, were home during the night. One hour later, Abdullah took a shower. Hamed put on his new Tommy Hilfiger jacket, slipped out, and made his way, probably by bus, to the Pattullo. When Nastoh arrived at the Pattullo Bridge he killed himself.  Investigation  When Abdullah got out of the shower, he realized that Hamed had disappeared. He phoned his parents, and their father, Kirim, rushed home to investigate. On finding the note, he phoned the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hamed didn‚Äôt give any hints about how he killed himself, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched around Nastoh's home. The day after, police found his body in the Fraser River, just south of the Pattullo Bridge. He wore a blue Nike backpack filled with rocks to weigh himself down. According to the coroner's report, \\"They were unnecessary.\\" Hamed Nastoh died from blunt trauma after his eye hit a rock in the water at around 108 kilometres per hour. The only noticeable mark was a minor scratch on his nose. A week before his death, Hamed had attended a suicide awareness talk at Enver Creek Secondary School, given by a mother who had lost her son. In his note, Hamed wrote that he'd given his parents a ‚Äúhint‚Äù when he mentioned that the speaker had said that suicidal people give hints.  Aftermath and impact on schools  = Homosexuality issues high school course = Hamed's suicide from the Patullo Bridge made the Government of British Columbia to introduce the Grade 12 Homosexuality issues course. This course was developed in 2007 and is considered an elective course for Grade 12 high school students. This course was meant to prevent a trial in court before the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, which made the agreement to listen to a gay couples complaints that secondary schools in British Columbia are blameworthy of prejudice by not talking about sexual identities as how the curriculum expects. As a comeback, the Liberal Party of Canada agreed with the Government of British Columbia in developing this course, which discusses the topic of tolerance, especially how it relates to sexual identities, ethnicity and race. However, the course will not be mandatory in 37 secondary schools in British Columbia that represent over 8,000 students. = Hamed Nastoh‚Äôs Anti-Bullying Coalition = Hamed mentioned in his suicide note for the reader to go to all the secondary schools in Surrey. He wanted other students to know that all forms of bullying can have a bad impact on the victim. Listening to his message, Nasima formed Hamed Nastoh's Anti-Bullying Coalition, to raise awareness of bullying in elementary and high schools, and help parents of children suffering from bullying. Nasima has presented Hamed's suicide note and story to numerous Canadian schools in Abbotsford, Hope, Mission, New Westminster, North Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, Vancouver and Whistler. His mother states her message is clear and simple: \\"Suicide is not the solution.\\" Using her son‚Äôs suicide note to show how much he suffered in high school before committing suicide, Nasima hopes to give support to teenagers and the community and assure them they are not alone. Nasima said, \\"Seek help. If you don't talk about it nobody can hear,\\" noting that children and teenagers are afraid of having discussions about being bullied if they notify their parents or teachers. Nasima says that Hamed Nastoh's Anti-Bullying Coalition has given her confidence to overcome her agony and misery.

He is a senior principal research manager at Microsoft Research. He is known for his research in human-computer interaction, specifically on sensing techniques, pen computing, and cross-device interaction.Ken Hinckley's page at Microsoft Research.  Background  After received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1991, Hinckley completed a master's degree in Computer Science (1993) and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Virginia (1996), where he studied with advisor Randy Pausch. Hinckley began working at Microsoft Research in 1997, where his primary research areas include novel input devices, device form-factors, and modalities of interaction. Hinckley has received numerous professional distinctions in the field of human-computer interaction. He has published over 80 academic papers in this field, and claims more than 150 patents. Hinckley is a member of the CHI AcademyKen Hinckley's biography at 2014 SIGCHI Awards. Retrieved on 24 March 2018. and has served as associate editor at ACM TOCHI (Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction) since 2003. His work has been cited more than 8000 times.Ken Hinckley's page at Google Scholar.  Work  Hinckley has made notable contribution to the areas of human-computer modalities and their hardware design. His work spans numerous, often- overlapping topics, including bimanual interaction, sensing devices and techniques, pen and touch interaction, and cross-device interaction. = Bimanual interaction = In the 1990s, Hinckley studied bimanual interaction at the University of Virginia, often in collaboration with doctoral advisor Pausch. His work had applications in the field of neurosurgery, specifically, in neurosurgical medical imaging. Hinckley's doctoral thesis, Haptic Issues for Virtual Manipulation (1997) investigated two-handed spatial interaction in user interfaces for applications in neurosurgical visualization. The paper presents two-handed virtual manipulation as an alternative interaction technique for the WIMP interface and investigates the role of passive haptic feedback in virtual manipulation.Hinckley, K., Haptic Issues for Virtual Manipulation. Doctoral Thesis. UMI Order Number: GAX97‚Äê24701, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, January 1997. Advisor: Randy Pausch. Hinckley's thesis work was conducted in collaboration with the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Virginia.Ken Hinckley's CV at Microsoft Research. Hinckley's research in bimanual interaction suggests that two-handed interfaces can offer cognitive advantages for the user, such as providing a perceptual frame of reference independent of visual feedback that single- handed interfaces lack.Hinckley, K., Pausch, R., and Proffitt, D., Attention and Visual Feedback: The Bimanual Frame of Reference. In Proc. I3D 1997 Symp. on interactive 3D Graphics, Providence, RI, April 27 ‚Äê 30, 1997, pp. 121‚Äê126. = Sensing techniques = At Microsoft Research, Hinckley has studied sensing techniques in interaction with mobile handheld devices. In Sensing Techniques for Mobile Interaction (2000), Hinckley and co-authors Jeff Pierce, Mike Sinclair, and Eric Horvitz integrated hardware sensors into a mobile device to enable functionalities such as automatically powering up when the user picks up the device and switching between portrait and landscape display modes when the device's physical orientation changes.Hinckley, K., Pierce, J., Sinclair, M., and Horvitz, E. Sensing techniques for mobile interaction. In ACM UIST 2000 Symp. on User interface Software and Technology, San Diego, California, pp. 91‚Äê100. Implementation of tilt, touch, and proximity sensors produced a context-sensitive interface that responded to the user and the environment. Hinckley's research introduced new modes of interaction for mobile device UI design.\\"UIST 2000: The 13th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology\\", UIST. Hinckley and his colleagues were awarded the UIST 2000 Best Paper Award for Sensing Techniques for Mobile Interaction. Sensor Synaesthesia: Touch in Motion, and Motion in Touch was published at CHI 2011. The work investigated multimodal input techniques on mobile handheld devices, specifically, how the combination of touch and motion sensing mutually enhanced, and enabled, synaesthetic techniques such as tilt-to-zoom and differentiating soft taps from hard taps.Hinckley, K., and Song, H., Sensor Synaesthesia: Touch in Motion, and Motion in Touch, In Proc. CHI 2011 Conf. on Human Factors in Computing Systems. Hinckley and co-author Hyunyoung Song received the CHI 2011 Honorable Mention Award for their research. = Pen computing = Some of Hinckley's recent work in sensing includes Sensing Techniques for Stylus + Touch Interaction (2014). A study conducted by researchers at University of Manitoba, Cornell University, and Microsoft Research explored grip and motion sensing in pen and touch interaction.Hinckley, K., Pahud, M., Benko, H., Irani, P., Gavriliu, M., Guimbretiere, F., Chen, X. 'A.', Matulic, F., Buxton, B., and Wilson, A. D., Sensing Techniques for Tablet+Stylus Interaction. UIST 2014. The study employed a number of tools that evaluate user grip and motion behaviors in order to contextualize usage patterns using stylus and tablet devices. For instance, the research demonstrated how tablet grip sensing techniques could be used as heuristics to detect unintentional thumb contact with the touch screen.

He was born in the Year of the Bull and the month of Taurus, his signature mascot. Chua was known for his astute and biting political cartoons. He was described as \\"Review's Unsparing Brushman\\" by the South China Morning Post in the March 14, 1976 issue and by Asia Week as the \\"Legendary Cartoonist of Singapore\\".  Early life  Chua was born at Byrne's Maternity Clinic in Singapore on May 3, 1949. He is the eldest of seven children (five younger sisters and a younger brother) born to Henry Chua Peng Yam, an Electrical and Sanitary Contractor, and his wife, Lily Teo Wah Sek. He spent his childhood in 350-B, Geylang Lorong 18, Singapore. Describing his childhood, Chua mentioned he often drew animated strips with rolled paper to entertain his sisters, brother and the children in our neighborhood. Many believed these strips were good enough for entrance to the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) in Singapore. Chua was educated in Presbyterian Boys‚Äô School and he joined the 5th Singapore Company of Boys‚Äô Brigade. = National Pioneer = Chua belongs to the first batch of young men to be called up for the national service in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1967. His drawings were first published by the Pioneer (National Pioneer in the early days), a magazine published by SAF which provides news on army matters relating to Singapore. The cover of first issue is in plain text and a photo, and Chua's illustrations was published in the second and sequence issues. He came to realization that he could use cartoon to represent people's voices and worked voluntarily for the National Pioneer. \\"I will always serve my people and my country\\", Chua said.  Career  = The Singapore Herald = D-Day of The Singapore Herald (May 28, 1971 issue) Chua began working for the newly established daily The Singapore Herald in 1970 as the chief editorial artist, joined by Lionel Rajapaksa and Gopal Chandradas. In 1971, the government closed the paper, alleging foreign financed plots, ‚ÄúBlack Operations‚Äù. The paper was critical of then prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew who was offended by Chua's cartoon of Lee on a tank threatening to crush a baby representing press freedoms that reportedly caused the newspaper's shutdown. = Far Eastern Economic Review = Chua moved to Hong Kong, to the newly established weekly, The Asian. Derek Davies, the editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER) had taken notice of Chua from his days in Singapore. So after travelling and working in Europe for 3.5 months, in late 1972 he began to do cartoons for the FEER. This led to him being hired as its first art director on December 1, 1972, at the age of 23. His work in this period included images of leaders such as Prince Sihanouk, Tun Razak, Indira Gandhi and Lee Kuan Yew. The FEER enjoyed almost two decades of rapid growth. Iconic covers include Chua's image of Li Ka-shing as \\"Superman Li\\", and Margaret Thatcher leading the surrender. In 1981, Chua received a letter from Li Ka-shing for FEER's \\"Superman Li\\" cover. According to Chua, his inspiration for this cover was partly influenced by his son. Tiananmen incident Morgan took a sabbatical from the FEER in 1988‚Äì89 to travel the Silk Road and other parts of China in early 1989. That happened to coincide with the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, and Chua was so shocked by this event that he draw more than 100 cartoons of the massacre and was later published in his book Tiananmen in the same year.  Martial art  While in Hong Kong, Chua has mastered the martial art, Wing Chun in the early 1970s. Chua was trained by one of Bruce Lee's instructors, believed to be Wong Shun Leung.  Retirement  = Back to Singapore = Returning to FEER, he remained there until changing circumstance at the publication combined with a desire to return closer to his Singaporean roots. He returned to Singapore in 1999 and spent the most of the next 20 years between Singapore and Tanjung Pinang, Bintan, an island in Indonesia just across the straits from Singapore where it was close enough to the city. As a semi-retiree enjoying life, he accepted the limitations of cartooning in Singapore and became acceptable to the leaders, including doing a book of cartoons of Lee Kuan Yew which was, he said, to \\"show the humane side‚Äù of the leader\\". In a short span of 20 years back in Singapore, he has closely worked with publishers, inspired many young cartoonists and illustrators and has published a few books of cartoons, particular to Singaporean. In 2011, he received a complimentary letters from Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong for his work on Lee's late wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo ‚Äî In Memory of Kwa Geok Choo (1921-2010), which according to Chua \\"is even better than the Cultural Medallion award\\".  Illustrations for BBC  The illustrations of Zhou Yong-kang by Chua for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was published on June 13, 2015. Zhou was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court. Zhou was said to have taken 129 million yuan (over $20 million) in bribes.  Death  Chua was hard at work right up to the time he was down with Pleural effusion. He died on Thursday, 22 March 2018, aged 68, after he was hospitalized in a hospital in Bintan, Indonesia. and in a coma from which he never recovered. Chua was accompanied by his son and returned to Singapore on March 23, 2018. Chua is now rested in Mandai Columbarium and his plaque is engraved with his signature mascot, a Taurus Bull, and quotes about his artwork.

The crater was discovered by NASA's New Horizons space probe on its flyby of Pluto. The name was chosen as a reference to Leia Organa from the Star Wars media franchise in the theme of naming Charon's craters after science fiction characters. Organa crater is rich in frozen ammonia, which suggests it was created very recently. The location of Organa crater is in the northern Pluto- facing hemisphere of Charon. Ammonia A composite image showing the ammonia around Organa crater, in green. Organa crater is the only known crater on Charon that contains abundant ammonia. The ammonia was detected using the New Horizons LEISA instrument, by observing an absorption of infrared light in the band, which is associated with ammonia. The source of the ammonia has not been confirmed, but it is associated with the impact process that created Organa crater, perhaps by removing the overlaying layer of water of ice and regolith. If this is confirmed, the detection could indicate that Charon has experienced cryovolcanic activity, with ammonia as magma. This interpretation is puzzling, since cryovolcanism isn't known to occur on such small bodies. In this scenario, the ammonia may have precipitated from an atmosphere, or soaked the ground from a subsurface source, or diffused out of the existing tholin. An alternate explanation suggests the deposit of ammonia was delivered by the impactor that created Organa crater. In either case, it is believed that Organa crater is the result of a recent impact, less than 10 million years ago. The impact that created Organa crater may have been so recent that the ammonia hasn't yet been destroyed by radiation from space.

It marked Gene Hackman's film debut.  Plot  The film is a heavily fictionalized treatment of the life of Vincent \\"Mad Dog\\" Coll Curran, who was born in 1908 in County Donegal, Ireland. In the film, Coll is depicted as growing up with an abusive father who beats and ridicules him (the film opens with him machine-gunning his father's gravestone), and started a street gang at a very young age, which led in turn to organized crime. He is portrayed as a psychopath, incapable of fear or compassion, who is never more happy than when he is recklessly shooting people with his tommy gun or feuding with the fellow mobster Dutch Schultz over whisky hijacking. The film ends with Coll being shot down by the police after Schultz puts a contract on him, but in fact he was arrested, tried, released, then later killed by associates of Lucky Luciano because he was making too much trouble for the syndicate. The incident where he allegedly was involved in the accidental shooting of a five-year-old boy (which led to his nickname in the press) is incorrectly associated with him shooting his way out of an attempt on his life (two boys hanging around the docks are killed), when in fact it happened as a result of a kidnapping he was accused of being part of. Dutch Schultz is depicted by Vincent Gardenia, who was 15 years older than Chandler‚ÄîColl was only seven years younger than Schultz.

New York Times. 19 May 1940;. p 98. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times with Index. Accessed 25 March 2018.

It is best known for the false incrimination of four suspects, some of whom died in prison during their nine years of incarceration, before being acquitted in 1995. Duncan, a sixteen-year-old half-Thai/American student, was abducted after leaving her school in Bangkok on 22 July 1986; her body was found a few days later in wetlands in Samut Prakan Province. Four men were arrested, eventually convicted of murder, and sentenced to death in 1990. Later re-investigations by the Crime Suppression Division found evidence of false testimony by a key witness, and that the men had made forced confessions under duress. The convictions were overturned by the Supreme Court in 1995, but by then one of the wrongly accused men had died in prison, one had sustained permanent spinal injuries, and another died from tuberculosis shortly after release. Two men were arrested and convicted for the murder. They implicated Suwiboon Patpongpanit for hiring them; she was convicted by the Court of First Instance but later acquitted by the Supreme Court in 1999 due to insufficient evidence. The police officer who led the original investigation, Police Colonel Mongkol Sripho, was retroactively dishonourably discharged for fabricating evidence, but he had already retired and emigrated to the United States, and was not brought to face criminal charges. In 2003, the Civil Court awarded the scapegoats and/or their descendants 26 million baht in damages. The case is often raised as an example of police corruption and the problems facing Thailand's justice system. It was adapted into a film (titled Sherry Ann and directed by Charoon Wattanasin) by Five Star Production in 2001.

The house on the Kettenhofweg in Frankfurt's Westend district was, in 1994, the scene of a sixfold murder whilst the house was being used as a brothel. The house stood empty for a while after the murders until it was brought by a Viennese real estate company. It is now occupied by an investment company. The building The building is a neo-Baroque style double tenement with a rich, partially sculpted stone fa√ßade and overhanging side risalits. The building is partly original. It was built in 1902. Brothel In 1977, the house was brought by Hungarian businessman Gabor Bartos and his German wife Ingrid. The couple lived in the ground floor, and in the converted cellar and on the first and second floors, they operated an exclusive brothel. The cellar consisted of a make-up room, a meeting room where the prostitutes were presented to clients, a sauna and a locker room. Many of the clients were from business, politics, authorities and from the judiciary. New clients were only accepted on the recommendation of existing clients. Ingrid Bartos also owned a stationery store in Frankfurt and would issue receipts for stationery to brothel customers so they could claim their visit against expenses. The prostitutes were mainly from Hungary, Estonia and the CIS countries. Murders On August 15, 1994, the owners and four Russian prostitutes were found murdered. The body of Gabor Bartos was found in the sauna, strangled from behind, the bodies of his wife Ingrid and Marina Erokina were found in other rooms in the basement. Veronika Sorokina and Yelena Starikova were found dead on the first floor and Olga Lucina on the 2nd. All had been strangled with electrical flex. Initially the Russian mafia were suspected of the murders. Sofia Berwald, a Moldovan former prostitute in the brothel and her husband Eugen Berwald (born Yevgeny Balakin in Moldova) were detained as suspects. Police later established the murders occurred when Gabor Bartos returned from walking his dog to find Eugen and Sofia Berwald robbing the brothel. Eugen Berwald was sentenced to life imprisonment for sixfold murders, his wife Sofia was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for robbery. Frieda Vogel wrote a novel Todesengel √ºber Frankfurt : ein Psychothriller √ºber die Bordell-Morde im Kettenhofweg (Death angel over Frankfurt: a psychological thriller about the brothel murders in Kettenhofweg) based on the murders.

She was a founding member of the Bangarra Dance Theatre.  Biography  Munyarryun was born in Yirrkala, a community in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. She grew up in the Garthalala homeland, and as a young girl she travelled with her family across country to establish the community of Dhalinybuy. She is a Yolngu woman of the Wangnurri clan. In 1984, she started working at National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA) Dance College in Sydney, and started cultural workshops to bring traditional dance practices to urban students. She also helped establish the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Dance Theatre (AIDT), contributing as a choreographer and tutor. In 1989, Bangarra Dance Theatre was formed after NAISDA director Carole Johnson left the organisation, and Munyarryun contributed as a founding member. She had two children, Rarriwuy and Guruguru, to Paul Hick, an English-born dancer. They separated when Rarriwuy was young. Hick lived in Sydney and in their children's later childhood, they would share their time between Hick in Sydney and their mother in Dhalinybuy. Rarriwuy remarked of her mother: \\"[she] was dancing at Bangarra when she was pregnant with me and she took me to all the rehearsals and performances after I was born\\". Munyarryun has continued as the cultural advisor for Bangarra, ensuring that their \\"performances adhere to the traditional stories and songs of her people\\". She has also worked as an advisor to the Australian Ballet. In May 2012, Munyarryun performed with an Aboriginal dance troupe at Windsor Castle, England, for celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. She also worked to establish the Bunggul Djama Arts Alliance, a community-driven initiative to foster Yolngu performance arts and mixed-media projects. In 2013, Munyarryun worked on and performed in the dance production The Morning Star. The production travelled between Arnhem Land and Mirramu Creative Arts Centre near Lake George in Bungendore, NSW.

Used in the production of beer and whisky for centuries, it is also an ingredient in modern foods. Background Hogarth; used to emphasise the healthy nature of a drink safer than most water Until the late 19th century, lack of access to clean drinking water meant particularly in urban areas, it was often safer to drink so-called small beer. These had relatively low levels of alcohol and were routinely drunk throughout the day by both workers and children; in 1797, one educationalist suggested for '...more robust children, water is preferable, and for the weaker ones, small beer ...'. This meant malt was seen as an essential part of dietary health for the poor and taxing it caused widespread dissent. Taxation In England, malt was first taxed in 1644 by the Crown to help finance the English Civil War. Article 14 of the 1707 Acts of Union between England and Scotland agreed the malt tax would not be applicable in Scotland until the conclusion of the 1701-1713 War of the Spanish Succession. After the Peace of Utrecht in April 1713, Parliament voted to extend the tax, despite protests from the 45 Scots Members of Parliament, which reflected general discontent on the impact of Union. At a meeting with Queen Anne on 26 May, a deputation that included the Earl of Mar and Duke of Argyll asked her to dissolve the Union, which was refused. According to William Cobbett, this tax contributed to inequality, poverty, and malnutrition in England, as it created a monopoly for malting and brewing, preventing ordinary householders from brewing their own nutritious beer for everyday use.

History  Saint Dionysius, founder of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity (nowadays known as Monastery Agios Dionysios), also founded the chapel of the Prophet Elias in the 16th century. It was built on the ruins of an ancient structure. Dionysus, who practised an ascetic life, is said to have lived in the church at times. The chapel is the highest ecclesiastical building of the Orthodox Church worldwide.  The building  The chapel was built on the top of Mount Profitis Ilias; the main building materials were the surrounding stones. The floor of the chapel is covered with stone slabs, the outer walls are made of layered stones, without further connecting material. Covered with stone slabs, the roof is supported by a solid wooden construction to support the snow load. An atrium is protected on the eastern and southern sides by a natural stone wall, which has an entrance on the north side. The low entrance to the chapel is on the south side of the building.

Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZ2 at a press conference held at the annual 2018 Mobile World Congress event on February 26, 2018.https://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/new-xperia-xz2-and- xz2-compact-from-sony/?rl=global-en Hardware =Design and Build= The Xperia XZ2 Compact comes with the new \\"Ambient Flow\\" design, replacing the outdated \\"OmniBalance\\" that had been in use since 2013https://www.gsmarena.com/next_gen_xperias_bezelless_design-news-27474.php with curvy corners.https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/android- smartphones/sony-xperia-xz2-compact-3672517/ It consists of a new 7000-series aluminum alloy chassis that has a curved edge all around the device, plastic back, and 2.5D scratch-resistant front and made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5, resulting in a symmetric and curvier design aesthetic. The most defining change in the Xperia XZ2 Compact, as well as the Xperia XZ2 Premium and XZ2, is the placement of the camera on the back. It is now symmetrically arranged on the top-center of the device, as opposed to being placed on the top left side like on previous Xperia smartphones. The NFC antenna is placed along the Triple Image Sensing System, the MotionEye camera module and the now US- enabled fingerprint sensor, symmetrically aligned near the top-center axis of the device. The front houses the improved dual front-firing stereo speakers, one on the top bezel along with a 5 MP front camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and notification LED, and the other on the bottom bezel in an elongated slit along the edge of the glass and frame. The Xperia XZ2 Compact's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . The device comes in 4 colors: Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, Deep Green and Ash Pink. =Display and Performance= The Xperia XZ2 Compact is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, built on a 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo 385 processors (4x 2.7 GHz and 4x 1.7 GHz), 4/6 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 630 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with 3x carrier aggregation, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design with a total of 8 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 512 GB in a hybrid SIM 2 slot setup. Camera =MotionEye= Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first three-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. Known as the Sony IMX400, the sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960 fps, at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer though, due to limitations. The Xperia XZ2 Compact borrows the Motion Eye Camera from the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZ1. It comprises a 19 MP 1/2.3‚Äù Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22 Œºm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25 mm wide G Lens. It also features 4K HDR video recording, a world's first for Sony, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30 fps, a high-speed 1080p/60 fps and a 120 fps recording in 720p options. The front selfie camera has a 5-megapixel sensor (1/5\\") with 23 mm, f/2.2 lens, a 90-degree wide angle lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization). =Triple Image Sensing technology= The Xperia XZ2 Compact has the Triple Image Sensing technology that started with the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the image sensing (CMOS sensor with PDAF), distance sensing (Laser AF sensor) and color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, and also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking. It also has a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and locking focus on a subject, as well as an RGBC-IR (RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed) color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ. The Motion Eye Camera in the Xperia XZ2 Compact also has Predictive Capture. When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos. =3D Creator= The Xperia XZ2 Compact is also capable of capturing 3D objects without the need of a dual-camera setup, a feature that was first implemented into the Xperia XZ1. It utilizes the IMX400's built-in DRAM to offload captured data before being combined and built up in the proprietary 3D Creator application, creating a near-perfect rendition of the subject, be it a face of a person, a whole head or any object the user may wish to capture. The user is then given the option to use the rendered 3D image on the included animated figures for a more creative approach or have it 3D-printed by Sony's approved 3D printing companies, all within the app itself. Battery The Xperia XZ2 Compact is powered by a non-removable 2870 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built- in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan. =Battery Care= The Xperia XZ2 Compact also comes with Battery Care, Sony's proprietary charging algorithm that controls the charging process of the phone through machine learning. It recognizes the user's charging habits for a certain period and automatically adjusts itself to the pattern, for example an overnight charge, by stopping the initial charging to about 80-90 percent, and then continuing it until full from where it left off the next day. This effectively prevents the unnecessary damage to the battery's cells from excessive heat and current due to overcharging, further increasing the battery's life span. Audio and Connectivity The Xperia XZ2 Compact is the first Xperia device that has no standard 3.5 mm audio jack, which has resulted in a somewhat mixed reaction from users and critics alike. To make up for the removal, the XZ2 Compact has improved wireless audio connectivity along with Sony's famed LDAC, an audio coding technology they've developed in-house, which is now a part of the Android Open Source Project, that enables the transmission of 24bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy, NFC, 4x4 MIMO antennas for fast WI-Fi and cellular upload/download speeds, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, MirrorLink, screen casting via Miracast and Google Cast, DLNA, GPS (with A-GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. The Xperia XZ2 Compact, like most new smartphone nowadays, has no FM radio. Software The Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact launched with the Android 8.0 Oreo operating system, along with Smart Stamina battery saving modes and Sony's proprietary multimedia apps.https://m.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz2-review-1735p4.php Android Pie started rolling out in OTA updates on October 12, 2018.https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/12/17967840/sony-android- pie-update-xperia-xz2-compact-rolling-out Android 10 arrived to Xperia XZ2 Compact on January 6, 2020.https://www.gsmarena.com/android_10_officially_arrives_for_sony_xperia_xz2_lineup_and_xz3-news-40874.php Successor The flagship Sony Xperia XZ3, announced in August 2018, did not have a compact variant as previous flagship models have had since 2014.

They have sometimes been referred to as part of the Meru people, a larger grouping which could also include the Ngaiawang and Erawirung peoples. There were at least two clans or sub-groups of the Ngawait people, the Barmerara Meru and Muljulpero maru. Country In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Ngawait had approximately of tribal land. They were one of the Murray River tribes, situated between Boggy Flat and Penn Reach, running to the vicinity of Loxton. They were also on the western side of the Lake Bonney. Their purchase on the Murray was between Nildottie and Devon Downs, at a place known as Wutjuwati. Defined by the Ngawait language, the group's traditional lands are in the upper reaches of the Murray within South Australia. There are a number of dialect groups, such as the Barmerara Meru group at Barmera. Their traditional lands were bordered on the west by the Ngaiawang and on the east by Erawirung peoples. Social organisation The Ngawait were composed of sub-groups or clans, of which at least two are known: * Barmerara Meru. (at Barmera) * Muljulpero maru Language They spoke the Ngawait language. Initiation ceremony Edward Eyre was on hand to describe the rites of passages among the Ngawait which ushered in youths to full manhood. His account is summarized by R. H. Mathews in the following passage:- > When one of these tribes neared the appointed place of meeting the men of > the tribe who had sent out the invitation sat down in a row to receive them. > The novices, painted with red ochre and grease, sat behind the men, and the > women sat behind the novices. The new mob now approached-the men painted and > carrying their weapons, the women and children being the rear, separate from > the men, and a little on one strangers halted, and some of their women > singled out of the rest and stood between the two tribes. These women then > threw down their cloaks and bags and raised a loud wail, accompanied by > frantic gesticulations, lacerating their bodies with sharp shells till the > blood flowed from the wounds. After some time had been spent in this way the > women took up their bundles again and returned to the rear of their own > party.An elderly man of the Narwijjerook people now advanced and held a > short colloquy with the local mob. He then stepped back and brought his own > men forward, exhibiting in front three uplifted spears, to which were > attached the little nets left with them by the envoys already referred to, > and which were the emblems of the duty they had to perform. The men of the > Moorundie tribe now rose to their feet with a suppressed shout. The new > arrivals then speared fifteen or sixteen of the local men in the left arm a > little below the shoulder, the latter holding out their arms for the purpose > of receiving the wounds. The Narwijjerooks then withdrew about a hundred > yards and camped. > When all the tribes had arrived the date was fixed for carrying out the > ceremonies. Early in the morning of the appointed day the novices were > mustered out of the camp and ran away a short distance, where they were > captured and thrown down.

It consists of a stylised urn on a pedestal, both made in corten steel and standing just over eight-foot (2.5 metres) high, surrounded by wooden benches inscribed with aphorisms written by Pope. It was commissioned to celebrate the 2015 Rugby World Cup, for which Twickenham Stadium was one of the venues, and was opened in a ceremony on 21 September 2015. Pope's Urn was the initiative of Twickenham resident Graham Henderson as public art consultant for the London-based arts charity Poet in the City. Henderson conceived the project and worked in partnership with Richmond upon Thames Council, and the architectural design practice Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, to design, build and install it. It was unveiled by Lord True, Leader of Richmond Council, in a ceremony which included readings from Pope's works by the actor John Hannah, who is a local resident, and by the actress Dame Harriet Walter. The sculpture is based on drawings that have survived of an urn designed by Alexander Pope for a friend's garden at Hagley Hall, Worcestershire. The original urn no longer exists.

It stars Jack Gore, Miya Cech, Benjamin Flores Jr. and Alessio Scalzotto. The film, which was Stentz's modern take on the kid-centered action films of the 1980s, was streamed on Netflix on May 24, 2019. It was the most watched content in the SVOD service in the UK the week it was released, overtaking the series Dead to Me and Riverdale. Plot Alex, a socially reclusive boy who recently lost his father in a fire, reluctantly attends a summer camp in southern California called \\"Rim of the World\\". He meets two other \\"misfits\\" - ZhenZhen, an orphan from China, and Dariush, an outspoken boy from a rich family. That afternoon ZhenZhen wanders off into the woods looking for the lookout point she had seen on a camp poster, while Alex attempts to follow. He comes across Dariush, who happens to be nearby answering the call of nature. Dariush mistakenly tries to 'cure' Alex's fear of heights by making him stand near a cliff edge, and Gabriel, a boy they hadn't seen at camp before, intervenes and help stop Dariush from trying to 'cure' Alex's fear of heights. ZhenZhen, hearing the commotion, comes back down and meets up with the boys. At that moment they all receive alarming texts advising they immediately evacuate the area. While hurrying back they find out that other campers have leaved the lake and they witness alien ships invading the valley. The kids head back to the camp, and afterward discover the camp to be empty of people - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, a Dragon spacecraft fleeing the International Space Station lands heavily nearby. The dying astronaut inside the spacecraft gives Alex a key with instruction that it get to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) facility in Pasadena, and that it was the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its \\"dog\\" and kills the astronaut, alex and his friends try to hide out and later it kills Conrad, but Alex and his friends manage to elude the aliens and escape the camp. They make their way to the Sheriff's Office and discover an inmate, Lou, who has been left behind in the cells. Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to the JPL. Later, the group encounter Marines who are evacuating civilians - the commander gratefully takes the key and puts the children on a bus to safety. However, alien ships attack the vehicle convoy and the soldiers are killed, whereupon Alex retrieves the key and the group sets out for the JPL once more. During the night, after briefly taking refuge in Gabriel's old house, Gabriel explains that he is an escapee from juvie, where he was placed due to a misunderstanding at his mother's store in which a man assumed Gabriel was attempting to steal his change at the deposit box, and unaware of Gabriel's dyscalculia. Sometime after they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals led by Lou. He agrees to let the kids go, but only if Alex gives him the key, which Lou thinks he can sell on the black market. Alex refuses and Lou attempts to kill alex with a knife but right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp appears and attacks them all. Lou is killed, but the kids manage to escape after trapping the alien in a backyard swimming pool. While they are walking in the forest, Dariush and Gabriel fights and Dariush reveals that his father lost their car dealership meaning he will go to jail, hence the reason why Dariush was placed at camp. The kids walks into the mall and change clothes after that the Group takes a car in the parking, which they discover ZhenZhen is able to drive, to quickly journey the rest of the way to JPL, but they are again attacked by the pursuing alien. They abandon the vehicle while trying to escape the alien and realize that they left the key in the car. Dariush attempts to go alone to get the key only to be injured by the alien in the process, but manage to get away with the key. The group finally make it to the JPL facility, but find the doctor they were trying to reach is dead. The kids are able to make radio contact with a general at NORAD who explains that the key holds information that can be used to destroy the alien mothership in orbit via a Cold War defense project named Excalibur. ZhenZhen goes into the basement to restart the power generators, where she is attacked by an alien dog, while Alex goes to the roof to realign the communication dish, where he is attacked by the alien. ZhenZhen manages to lock the dog in the basement and now returns to the command room to help Gabriel and the injured Dariush insert the keys that will launch the Excalibur weapon. Zhenzhen, Dariush, and Gabriel evacuate the JPL building, while Alex lures the alien into an engine test room and kills it with the engine's exhaust. The teens watch from the ground as the alien mothership is blown up in the atmosphere. Alex is reunited with his mother and the children are celebrated as heroes. Cast Production In March 2018, it was reported that McG would direct Rim of the World for Netflix from a screenplay by Zack Stentz. In an interview, Stentz revealed that he started working on the script as early as 2017 and the deal with Netflix was closed a year later. Principal production commenced in May 2018 in Los Angeles, California. In June 2018, the cast was announced. Principal photography began in June 2018 and reportedly lasted 40 days. Reception On the review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 25% based on 12 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.8/10.

Sophoulis suggests that the story of the martyrdom was Roman propaganda to deter officials from collaborating with the Bulgars and strengthen the resolve of cities vulnerable to Bulgar attack.

It has been designed by Viennese architect Joseph Kornh√§usel, constructed on the earthwork of the lower castle.  History  Habsburg Palace on the 1906 postcard In 1838 the arch-prince Karl Ludwig Habsburg brought Joseph Kornh√§usel , a representative of Viennese classicism, to Cieszyn. The upper and lower castles were destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. Karl Ludwig ordered Kornh√§usel to rebuild the remains of the castle to make it his residence. To achieve the aim the ruins were demolished and the remains of the lower castle were used to build the so- called Hunting Palace between 1838-1840. Next to the Palace a single-story classicist conservatory was built, which was demolished in 1966. The Palace did not perform its original function. It was rarely visited by the Habsburgs (who most often stayed in Vienna) and on everyday basis was the seat of the Chamber of Cieszyn. However, concerts and performances that took place in the conservatory that was located next to the palace became historical; a concert of Franz Liszt in June 1846 and Wagner performances of artists of the Viennese opera organised by the arch-duke Eugene Ferdinand at the end of the 1880s of the nineteenth century. Occasional visits of the Habsburgs were always special events ‚Äì one of the visitors was the emperor Francis Joseph the First who stayed in the Hunting Palace in 1880, 1890 and 1906. On the first floor of the palace there was a special suite consisting of a study, living room, reception room and a bedroom with a toilet, waiting for him. During the visits of Franz Joseph, the so-called Tent from Custoza was put up for him and his guests - a gift from the arch-duke Albrecht (the arch-duke took part in the victorious battle of Custoza). When between 1914 ‚Äì 1916 Cieszyn was the headquarters of the Austro-Hungarian Army (AOK ‚Äì Armeeoberkommando), the archduke Frederick hosted his allies in the Palace, among others the German emperor Wilhelm II, Bulgarian king Ferdinand and Marshal Hindenburg. The last visit of the archduke Ferdinand to the palace took place on 3 December 1916. In 1918 the Hunting Palace became the seat of the National Council of the Duchy of Cieszyn, the first Polish authority in the area of Cieszyn Silesia. Since 1974 a part of the Hunting Palace has been the seat of the Ignacy Paderewski State School of Music. Since 2005, i.e. the time of renovation, the remaining part of the palace and a newly build conservatory (constructed at the site of the former) has served as the seat of Zamek Cieszyn (formerly: ≈ölƒÖski Zamek Sztuki i Przedsiƒôbiorczo≈õci) - a cultural institution that is a design centre.  Architecture  The Habsburg Palace was constructed as a hunting lodge. The Palace, constructed on the plan of an inverted letter T, is located on the site of the lower castle on the eastern slope of a hill and its fa√ßade faces the city. The Habsburg residence is a two-story brick building. Its central part has three storeys. The central part of the palace is of a palladian structure of a serliana; an arch flanked at the sides by flat cornices and crowned by a triangle pediment. It is located between by two storeyed wings with symmetrically distributed vestibules. Builders used the remains of two fortified towers located in the south and north wings (so called bastei). In the 19th century side wings were added; the south one located perpendicularly and the north one parallel to the main part of the building. The interior arrangement of the main part of the palace is based on a three bay plan, whereas the wings are based on a one bay plan with a corridor and a two bay plan. The interiors have a barrel vault with lunettes and a sail vault. There are also ceilings with coves. The fa√ßade of the residence has thirteen axes, the three central ones of which have been emphasised by a protrusion and crowned by a triangular bridgehead. The one storey part has a projection with three axes and a balcony with a cast-iron balustrade. A storey of the building is made distinct by a central arch emphasised by pilasters that support entablature. The windows on the ground floor are square with dimpled frames, whereas the ones on the first floor are closed with triangular pediments on consoles and cornices on the side parts. The side walls of the palace are multi-axis. A loggia located in the south fortified tower has four opened doric columns that support a triangular pediment. In front of the palace there is a two-arm and symmetrical access road with the Monument to honour Silesian Legionnaires fallen for Poland, located between the arms of the road. The monument is designed by Jan Raszka and commemorates the fallen legionnaires of Silesia.  Trivia  The Monument to honour Silesian Legionnaires fallen for Poland is also called The Silesian Woman and Nike of Cieszyn. The walls of the north bastei are 2.1 metres thick.

It is hosted by the web portal Zooniverse. The scientific team want to identify black hole/jet pairs and associate them with the host galaxies. Using a large number of classifications provided by citizen scientists they hope to build a more complete picture of black holes at various stages and their origin. It was initiated in 2010 by Ray Norris in collaboration with the Zooniverse team, and was driven by the need to cross-identify the millions of extragalactic radio sources that will be discovered by the forthcoming Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey. RGZ is now led by scientists Julie Banfield and Ivy Wong. RGZ started operations on 17 December 2013.  RGZ Data Sources  Australia Telescope Compact Array The project's scientific team are drawn mostly from Australia, with support from Zooniverse developers and other institutions. They use data taken by the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey which was observed at the Very Large Array between 1993 and 2011. Also used was data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS), taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in rural New South Wales. The infrared astronomy used was observed by Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spitzer Space Telescope.  RGZ Publications  Best-Ever Snapshot of a Black Hole's Jets RGZ has published five scientific studies (May 2018). i) Radio Galaxy Zoo: host galaxies and radio morphologies derived from visual inspection. (November 2015) The abstract begins: \\"We present results from the first twelve months of operation of Radio Galaxy Zoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170,000 radio sources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radio morphology.\\" It then explains that RGZ \\"uses 1.4GHz radio images from both the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) in combination with mid- infrared images at 3.4Œºm from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and at 3.6Œºm from the Spitzer Space Telescope.\\" Its aims are that when complete, RGZ will measure the relative populations and properties of host galaxies; processes that might also provide an avenue for finding radio structures that are rare and extreme. On the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) website, an article from September 2015 named \\"Volunteer black hole hunters as good as the experts\\" explains how citizen scientists are as good as professionals at RGZ's tasks. The research team tested trained citizen scientists and ten professional astronomers using a hundred images to help quantify the quality of the data gathered. As the initial results were published, facts and figures from RGZ became available. More than 1.2 million radio images have been looked at, which enabled 60,000 radio sources to be matched to their host galaxies: \\"A feat that would have taken a single astronomer working 40 hours a week roughly 50 years to complete.\\" Radio Galaxy 3C 83.1B an example of a Wide-angle Tail Radio Galaxy ii) Radio Galaxy Zoo: discovery of a poor cluster through a giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy. (May 2016) The abstract begins: \\"We have discovered a previously unreported poor cluster of galaxies (RGZ-CL J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in the Radio Galaxy Zoo project.\\" It continues to explain that the analysis of 2MASX J08231289+0333016's surrounding environment indicates that it is within a poor cluster. Radio morphology suggests that, firstly, \\"the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with respect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster\\" and secondly that \\"the source may have had two ignition events of the active galactic nucleus with 10^7yrs in between.\\" These suggestions reinforce the idea that there is an association between RGZ J082312.9+033301 and the newly discovered poor cluster. On The Conversation website in an article \\"How citizen scientists discovered a giant cluster of galaxies\\", Ray Norris writes about the above study. He explains that two Russian citizen scientists (CSs), Ivan Terentev and Tim Matorny, were participating in RGZ when they noticed something odd with one of the radio sources. It became clear that the radio source the two CSs had found \\"was just one of a line of radio blobs that delineate a C-shaped ‚Äúwide angle tail galaxy‚Äù (WATG).\\" Lead scientist Julie Banfield explained that this was \\"something that none of us had even thought would be possible.\\" WATGs are rare objects that are formed when jets of electrons from black holes, usually seen to be straight, are bent into a C shape by intergalactic gas. This characteristic shape is \\"a sure sign that there is intergalactic gas, signifying a cluster of galaxies, the largest known objects in the universe.\\" The WATG discovered by Terentev and Matorny is one of the largest known and has led to the cluster being named after them. \\"This cluster, more than a billion light years away, contains at least 40 galaxies, marking an intersection of the sheets and filaments of the cosmic web that make up our universe.\\" Clusters, despite their importance, are hard to find but the use of WATGs might be a way of finding more: However WATGs are rare. On the National Radio Astronomy Observatory website, Matorny and Terentev commented on their discovery. ‚ÄúI am still amazed and feel more motivated to look for stunning new radio galaxies,‚Äù Matorny said. Terentev added, ‚ÄúI got a chance to see the whole process of science ‚Ä¶ and I have been a part of it!‚Äù iii) Radio Galaxy Zoo: A Search for Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies. (December 2017) The abstract begins: \\"Hybrid morphology radio sources are a rare type of radio galaxy that display different Fanaroff-Riley classes on opposite sides of their nuclei.\\" The authors explain that RGZ has enabled them to discover 25 new candidate hybrid morphology radio galaxies (HyMoRS). These HyMoRS are at distances between redshifts z=0.14 and 1.0. Nine of the host galaxies have previous spectra and include quasars and a rare Green bean galaxy. It states: \\"Although the origin of the hybrid morphology radio galaxies is still unclear, this type of radio source starts depicting itself as a rather diverse class.\\" The abstract ends:\\"While high angular resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm our candidates, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the pre-selection of these sources from all-sky radio surveys, and report the reliability of citizen scientists in identifying and classifying complex radio sources.\\" In an article on the ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics CAASTRO website named \\"Citizen scientists bag a bunch of 'two-faced' galaxies\\", the author explains the findings of the above study. The lead scientist is Anna Kapinska with CS Ivan Terentev named second. Kapinska's team have been looking for rare types of galaxies named Hybrid Morphology Radio Galaxies (HyMoRS). These show galaxy characteristics that are combined, rather than distinct. The article states: \\"Finding more HyMoRS helps us understand what kind of galaxy can turn out this way, and what gives them their unusual properties. Knowing that, in turn, helps us better understand how all galaxies evolve.\\" The first recognised HyMoRS was discovered in 2002 and since then 30 more. RGZ near doubled the discoveries by adding 25 more. Galaxies with black holes that produce jets are often \\"divided into two classes, Fanaroff-Riley I and Fanaroff-Riley II (or FR I and II). FR I galaxies have jets that fade away as they extend outwards, while FR II galaxies have jets that end in a bright, strongly-emitting region (a ‚Äòhotspot‚Äô).\\" Explanations include the behaviour of the central black hole, different densities of matter in the surrounding environment or simply illusions because of different distances. iv) Radio Galaxy Zoo: Cosmological Alignment of Radio Sources (November 2017) Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope In November 2017, a team lead by Omar Contigiani published a paper in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society studying the mutual alignment of radio sources. Using data drawn from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS), they investigate the most powerful radio sources, namely the largest elliptical galaxies emitting plasma-filled jets. The abstract begins: \\"We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, FIRST and TGSS. This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the preferential directions of respectively 30059 and 11674 extended sources distributed over more than 7000 and 17000 square degrees.\\" The FIRST sample sources were identified by participants in RGZ, while the TGSS sample was the result of an automated process. Marginal evidence of local alignment is found in the FIRST sample, which has a 2% probability of being by chance. This supports other recent research by scientists using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The abstract ends: \\"The TGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal.\\" Results suggest that there is a relative alignment present at cosmological distances. v) Radio Galaxy Zoo: Compact and extended radio source classification with deep learning (May 2018). In May 2018, Lukic and team published a study in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society concerning machine learning techniques. The abstract begins: \\"Machine learning techniques have been increasingly useful in astronomical applications over the last few years, for example in the morphological classification of galaxies.\\"  Gems of the Galaxy Zoos (ZooGems)  During the next two years, up to 105 RGZ objects will be observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a result of Program 15445, whose P.I. is William Keel. The program's abstract begins: \\"The classic Galaxy Zoo project and its successors have been rich sources of interesting astrophysics beyond their initial goals. Green Pea starbursts, AGN ionization echoes, dust in backlit spirals, AGN in pseudobulges, have all seen HST followup programs.\\" As a result of NASA 'gap fillers' initiative, it is hoped that significant scientific progress can be made by HST observations of a total of 304 objects, which have been chosen by voters using a Zooniverse custom-made interface. Keel stated: \\"Each one of them might not be enough for an individual study, but when you put them all together it adds up to an interesting study.\\"  See also  * Radio astronomy * CSIRO * Evolutionary Map of the Universe * Galaxy formation and evolution * Galaxy morphological classification  References   External links  * The Radio Galaxy Zoo website. * The National Radio Astronomy Observatory Exploration and Discovery webpage. * Radio Galaxy Zoo: a quick start guide to hunting supermassive black holes.

After 1945 he became a member of East Germany's powerful Party Cenral Committee and then, in 1957, head of the country's Military Intelligence Service.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Willy S√§gebrecht was born in Gro√ü Sch√∂nebeck (Barnim), a short distance to the north of Berlin. His father is described variously as a farmworker, a factory worker and a brick maker. After leaving school in 1918 S√§gebrecht worked in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in Gro√ü Sch√∂nebeck and Liebenwalde. In 1920 he joined the Free German wood workers' union and the Young Socialists. In 1923 he switched to the Young Communists and in 1925, having reached his twenty-first birthday six months earlier, he joined the Communist Party itself. Within the party he was initially drawn to the extremist Weddinger Opposition faction, but after a couple of years he turned back to the Communist mainstream of the time, becoming a member of the party's local leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for Berlin-Brandenburg in 1927. In November 1929 S√§gebrecht was elected a local councillor for Liebenwalde and a district councillor for Lower Barnim. During 1929/30 he worked as an instructor in Berlin-Brandenburg with the party's \\"Military Policy\\" department (\\"Abteilung Milit√§rpolitik\\"), the cover name used for what was in effect the party's intelligence service. During 1930/31 he visited Moscow where he attended a course for party officials at the \\"Military Academy\\" of the Communist International (Comintern). On his return he became a party instructor for Berlin-Brandenburg, a role he retained till 1933. He was also employed as a policy leader (\\"Polleiter \\") in the party's \\"sub-region north\\" (\\"Unterbezirk Nord\\"), in which capacity he worked closely with Walter Ulbricht.Berliner Zeitung, 21 April 1971, p.8 On 24 April 1932 Willy S√§gebrecht was elected to membership of the Prussian regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). He was involved in a significant brawl in the parliament between Communist and Nazi members on 21 May 1932. = Nazi years = The Nazi Party took power at the start of 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. On 4 April 1933 S√§gebrecht and Max Herm, his comrade in the local leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\"), were arrested. They were subjected to physical mistreatment by Nazi paramilitaries at a nearby barracks and then taken to Sonnenburg concentration camp. S√§gebrecht was released at the end of October 1933. He made contact with Albert Kayser, formerly a Communist member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"), and returned to party work - now illegal - in the Berlin sub-region. He was re-arrested on 17 December 1934. In January 1936 S√§gebrecht faced the special people's court and was convicted on the relatively unusual charge of \\"intellectual activism\\" (\\"intellektuelle Willenst√§terschaft\\"). He was sentenced to a five-year jail term, but in the event he spent the rest of the Nazi period in a succession of prisons and concentration camps, released only in April 1945. His final transfer came in March 1941 and saw him sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. With other \\"political detainees\\" he created a \\"party group\\". Observing the divisions among the Nazi camp administrators they were able to identify which guards might prove helpful if cultivated, and by this method they managed to receive regular newspapers and other snippets of news about Germany from outside the camp. There were times when prisoners were sent to work outside the camp, and on one of these occasions the \\"party group\\" around S√§gebrecht managed to throw from the truck a number of anti-Hitler leaflets that they had managed to produce inside the concentration camp. During the early months of 1945 the Soviet army advanced relentlessly from the east, and in April the authorities in Germany desperately raced to empty the concentration camps. Sachsenhausen inmates were evicted and sent on forced marches (death marches) towards the west and north, but as discipline collapsed it was increasingly the guards themselves who fled. Sources state simply that in the course of the death march from Sachsenhausen towards Schwerin Willy S√§gebrecht was freed by Soviet troops near Below. = Soviet occupation zone = Directly following the liberation, in the middle of May 1945 S√§gebrecht became a member of the Communist Party Initiative Group around his old comrade, Walter Ulbricht. On 30 April 1945 Ulbricht had been flown over from Moscow, where with many comrades he had spent the war, bringing a group of 30 men and, as matter turned out, a detailed and well thought through nation-building agenda. The entire region surrounding Berlin - roughly the middle third of Germany - was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone. S√§gebrecht was employed by the Berlin city administration (\\"Magistratverwaltung\\") in the social welfare section. He also engaged, from Potsdam, in re-establishing a party leadership team (\\"KPD-Provinzialleitung Brandenburg\\"), becoming the Brandenburg regional party secretary. At the party conference of 2/3 March 1946 Willy S√§gebrecht was one of 19 party officials co-opted onto the Party Central Committee. A few weeks later, on 7 April 1946, the contentious special conference took place at which the old Communist Party was merged with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in order to create the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). The merger, which as events turned out was only directly implemented in the Soviet occupation zone, was intended to unite the political left and thereby make it impossible for right wing populists to take power, as had happened in 1933. S√§gebrecht gave a lead as one of thousands of comrades who lost no time in signing their Communist Party memberships across to the new party. By the time the Soviet Occupation Zone was relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany) the SED had itself become the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Under the Leninist power structure implemented in the Soviet Occupation Zone after 1946, political power was centralised on the Party Central Committee. The political influence of parliaments or of government ministers was relatively constrained. However, the centralisation of power was to some extent blurred by the fact that the same individuals often held positions of influence both within the Central Committee and in the quasi-democratic institutions. Willy S√§gebrecht was a case in point, sitting as a member of the People's Council (\\"Volksrat\\") and then of its successor body, the East German national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") between 1948 and 1958. In 1950 he became, in addition, a member of the National Council of the National Front,Neues Deutschland, 4 February 1950, p.2 the administrative structure used by the SED to control the allocation of parliamentary seats to bloc parties and mass organisations. Between 1946 and 1950 he sat as a member of the Brandenburg Regional Parliament (\\"Landtag Brandenburg\\"). From 1946 till 1949 he also shared the chairmanship of the regional Party Executive for Brandenburg with Friedrich Ebert Jr.. In December 1948 Ebert, who was son to the first president of the German Republic, became mayor of East Berlin, vacating his position as co- chair of the regional party executive. S√§gebrecht remained in post, now sharing the top job in the Brandenburg regional party executive with Paul Bismark till July 1952. Between 1949 and 1952 Willy S√§gebrecht also served as first secretary of the Brandenburg Party Executive. He was fully engaged in the Stalinisation of the Brandenburg party.Dieter Pohl: Justiz in Brandenburg 1945‚Äì1955. Gleichschaltung und Anpassung. M√ºnchen, 2001 p.102 = German Democratic Republic = In July 1952 Sagebrecht was appointed a secretary of state and first deputy chairman at the State Planning Commission (\\"Staatliche Plankommission\\"). He might have seemed at this point to be on the verge of a stellar political career. However, the State Planning Commission was also where the ambitions and promises of ambitious party leaders all too often came face to face with inconvenient economic realities. Willy S√§gebrecht was not the first, and he certainly would not be the last East German politician for whom involvement with the State Planning Commission broke the trajectory of a hitherto promising career in the political mainstream. In 1954 he was diverted into the quasi-military \\"Kasernierte Volkspolizei\\" (KVP) police service, appointed a KVP colonel in October 1954. He was responsible for \\"Administration Co-ordination\\" which according to at least one source was a \\"camouglage designation\\" for Military Intelligence. In 1945 the World War victors were agreed that no future German state should be permitted to have an army. Ten years later, cold war rivalries were calling that wartime consensus into question. To the west, the American, British and French occupation zones were merged and relaunched as the German Federal Republic (West Germany) in May 1949, and the West German army (Bundeswehr) was inaugurated in November 1955. In the former Soviet occupation zone (East Germany), it now transpired - at least from the western perspective - that the quasi-military \\"Kasernierte Volkspolizei\\" \\"police service\\" had been created to be a national East German army by another name: in March 1956 it was duly launched as the National People's Army (\\" Nationale Volksarmee\\"). Within it, in September 1957 Willy S√§gebrecht became head of military intelligence in succession to Karl Linke who had become suspected (correctly) of spying on behalf of \\"the west\\". In the event of some sort of an east-west war, S√§gebrecht's responsibilities would have included masterminding and conducting force-based operations in West Germany, including the activation of partisan networks.Dieter Kr√ºger, Armin Wagner: Im Spannungsfeld von Demokratie und Diktatur. Deutsche Geheimdienstchefs im Kalten Krieg. In:Konspiration als Beruf.: Deutsche Geheimdienstchefs im Kalten Krieg. Berlin, 2003 p. 21 S√§gebrecht himself was retired from his military intelligence responsibilities in August 1959, officially on health grounds. In the words of one source \\"he was not successful\\". His \\"retirement\\" came shortly after a senior member of his department, Siegfried Dombrowski, had fled to West Berlin. His successor, appointed on 31 August 1959, was another senior member of the department, Arthur Franke, whom he had first met in 1945 as the two of them fled from the concentraion camp.Klaus Behling: Der Nachrichtendienst der NVA, p.28. There is no indication that S√§gebrecht's own loyalty to the regime was ever in question: he remained a Party Central Committee member till 1963. However, after September 1959 he lived as a pensioner in East Berlin. In 1968 he published his memoires under the title \\"Nicht Ambo√ü, sondern Hammer sein\\" (lossely \\"Not an anvil but a hammer\\"). When he died, in 1981, his ashes were placed at the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery in the Gedenkst√§tte der Sozialisten (\\"Socialists' Memorial Garden\\"), alongside those of others whose memories the government celebrated and revered.Neues Deutschland, 24.

It has narrow leaves, sometimes with three or four teeth near the tip, and prominent, raised, netted to parallel veins. The flower heads are egg-shaped about 5 cm (2 in) in diameter and consist of at first yellow, later orange or scarlet perianths, and long styles reaching far beyond the perianth and together giving the impression of a pincushion. It is assigned to the family Proteaceae. It can be found in South Africa (KwaZulu- Natal, Mpumalanga) and Swaziland. It mostly flowers between September and November. The species is called dwarf pincushion or soapstone pincushion in English.  Description  Leucospermum gerrardii is a high, evergreen, mat- forming shrub of up to in diameter, with upright branches originating from an underground rootstock. These generally form a closed cover of equal height, so the result is somewhat reminiscent of a cushion. The stems that carry the flower heads are slender, upright, thick, initially covered in spiderweb-like hairs, which get lost with age. The leaves linear to inverted lance-shaped, sometimes curved sideways like a sabre, long and ¬æ‚Äì2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.8 in) wide, at the foot gradually narrowing into a distinct leaf stalk. The leaves usually have an entire margin and end in a bony tip, but sometimes have three or four teeth with a bony tip. They initially have some fine and soft hair on their surface, but this soon wears off. The leaves also have a prominent pattern of raised, netted to parallel veins. The flower heads are egg-shaped in diameter atop a long stalk, sit mostly individually, but sometimes with two or three together near the end of the branches. The communal base of the flowers in the same head has is cylinder-shaped 1¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.6‚Äì1.0 in) long and in diameter. It is covered underneath by oval bracts with a pointy tip of about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and half as wide, very densely covered in soft hairs, rubbery in consistency and set in two or three whorls. The bracts that subtend the individual flowers are narrower oval with a pointy tip, are about 1 cm long and wide, rubbery in consistency and embracing the flower at its foot. It is thickly woolly at its base and ends in a tuft of long straight hairs at its tip. The perianth is 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) long, initially yellow but later coloring orange to scarlet. The lower part of the tetramerous perianth is fused into a tube, the middle part that consist of the claws is ruptured by the style at anthesis, the parts coiling, the lobe facing the center of the flower head with fine very short, powdery hairs, the other lobes are thickly set with felty hairy. The upper part of the periant (or limbs) are lance- shaped and pointy at the tip, about ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) long, have a dense growth of with long straight hairs. The lance-shaped, pointy anthers are directly attached to the upper part of the perianth, are about 3 mm (0.12 in) long and lack a filament. The style that is about 5 cm (2 in) long, tapers towards the tip and slightly curves towards the center of the flower head. It is topped by a slight thickening called pollen presenter, which has a slender cone-shape with a pointy tip, is 2‚Äì2¬Ω mm (0.08‚Äì0.1 in) long, with a groove at the very end that acts as the stigma. The ovary is subtended by four nectar producing awl-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. It mostly flowers between September and December. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24).  Differences with related species  The dwarf pincushion differs from its nearest relatives (L. cuneiforme, L. innovans and L. saxosum) and other species with cylinder-shaped receptacles (common base of the flowers in one head) by growing in low cushion-like clusters, by the linear to inverted lance-shaped leaves that slightly curve sideways (like a sabre), and by having raised veins.  Taxonomy  HabitOtto Stapf described the dwarf pincushion in 1912, and named it in honor of William Tyrer Gerrard, who had collected the first specimens known to science probably in 1865. Although plants from central KwaZulu-Natal overall have broader leaves than those from Mpumalange, a continuous grade between the extremes exists, and no subtaxa have been proposed. L. gerrardii has been assigned to the section Crassicaudex.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The dwarf pincushion mainly occurs in grassveld among granite and quartzite outcrops in the higher mountain areas at 1200‚Äì1800 m (4,000‚Äì6,000 ft) in the Makhonjwa Mountains near Barberton and the northwest of Swaziland. A few small and isolated populations can be found on grassland on Table Mountain Sandstone and Ecca Sandstone in central Natal at 450‚Äì1100 m (1,500‚Äì3,500 ft) altitude. It is often associated with serpentine in the underground. Annual rainfall may be as much as 1000 mm (40 in) or 1500 mm (60 in) at the greater altitudes, mainly falling during the summer. The flowers are mainly pollinated by birds. The seeds are released from the heads about two months after flowering and are collected by ants that bring them to their underground nests. L. gerrardii plants survive the regular grass fires that kill the above-ground branches, because it regenerates from the many spreading, underground stems.  Conservation  L. gerrardii is considered near threatened, due to a reduction of the population by about 30% over the last hundred years that was caused by afforestation, overgrazing, too high-frequency burning and habitat fragmentation.

Early life and education  Anderson was the daughter of Dr. Thomas J. Anderson and Frances Daniel Anderson of Greensboro, Alabama. She was hit by a stray bullet at the age of four, became paraplegic, and used a gurney or a wheelchair for the rest of her life. In 1948, she graduated with a degree in art and history from Judson College. While she was a student at Judson, she was an officer in the Judson chapter of the Sigma Delta Pi honor society. In 1964, Anderson earned a master's degree from the University of Alabama.  Career  In 1948, she began teaching art unofficially at a high school in Greensboro; an Alabama law at the time prohibited severely disabled persons from teaching. She inspired a new law in 1953 that overturned this restriction. In 1954, she became the first seriously disabled educator to be hired by an Alabama public school. She taught English and Spanish, and after 1964 also served as a guidance counselor, at Greensboro High School. She retired from teaching in 1982. Anderson motivated the city of Greensboro to make changes to accommodate people with physical disabilities, and was a founding member of the Greensboro Friends of the Library. In 1977, she served on the Alabama Governor's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. Anderson won many awards including Outstanding Educator in 1974, Alabama's Outstanding Counselor of the Year for 1975-76, the 1977 Judson College Alumnae Achievement Award, and the Alabama Handicapped Professional Woman of the Year in 1977. In 2011, she was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame.  Personal life  Anderson lived with her parents, and later with her father and stepmother. In 1956, she vacationed in Cuba with her parents and brother. Her mother died in 1957. Evelyn Daniel Anderson died in Tuscaloosa following a short illness in 1998, aged 72 years.

Other Sabellii are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 685, 686 (\\"Sabellius\\"). Origin The nomen Sabellius belongs to a class of gentilicia typically formed directly from cognomina ending in -illus and -ellus, typically diminutive suffixes. The surname Sabellus referred to a member of the Oscan- speaking peoples of central and southern Italy, particularly the Sabines, Marsi, Samnites, and their relatives, and thus the name belongs to a common type of cognomen derived from the names of peoples and places of origin.Chase, pp. 113, 114, 124. Branches and cognomina The only cognomina known from this gens were Primus, first, a surname that usually indicated the eldest of a group of siblings, and Dilectus, dear or beloved. There is no evidence that either of these represented distinct families of the Sabellii.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. s. dilectus, primus. Members * Lucius Sabellius, prosecuted by Lucius Caesulenus, a famous speaker, under the lex Aquilia, for unlawfully damaging the property of another.

He specializes in true crime and political genres. He is known for producing the Emmy Award- nominated Amanda Knox and EuroTrump, focusing on Geert Wilders. Career =Education= Morse studied at the University of Pennsylvania and worked for Mother Jones after graduation. He graduated with an MBA from the University of Oxford's Sa√Ød Business School. =Early work= At the University of Pennsylvania, he directed and produced the feature documentary Ain't Easy Being Green, about the 2006 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania and Duet, a short film about street musician and future star of The Voice (U.S. season 8) Anthony Riley. In 2008, he shot a video of the New Black Panthers blocking the entrance to a polling location with a strong Democrat majority in Philadelphia during the 2008 United States Elections. The video was posted on YouTube and went viral with over a million views, causing a Congressional investigation. Morse subsequently regretted the video's success, as it was regularly repeated on Fox News early in Barack Obama's presidential career. This allowed 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump to warn Pennsylvania voters to watch out for fraud from Democrat supporters, a charge that Morse refuted, citing that the incident he witnessed was isolated. The Philadelphia incident became known as the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case. =MyTwoCensus: 2010 Census Watchdog = In February 2009, Morse founded MyTwoCensus, a non-partisan, political watchdog group for the 2010 U.S. Census. =Skillbridge = Morse also co-founded the graduate consultancy group Skillbridge, which was sold to Toptal in 2016. =Amanda Knox = In 2016, Morse produced the Netflix documentary Amanda Knox. Morse started making the film while he was an Erasmus Mundus journalism student in 2011. The documentary covers Knox's life and wrongful prison sentence for murder and her subsequent acquittal. Morse was nominated for an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special\\". =EuroTrump= Along with co-director Nick Hampson and co-writer Maria Springer, Morse produced EuroTrump, a film about the right-wing Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who has been compared to Trump. Morse managed to gain Wilders' trust following his work on Amanda Knox; though he did not personally agree with Wilders on many issues, he felt it was important to respect them in order to find out more about Wilders' politics. He was given permission to film Wilders during campaigning for the 2017 Dutch general election, and consequently gained more access to Wilders than other news organizations. The film was released shortly after the Dutch elections at the Sheffield Documentary Festival as ‚ÄúWilders‚Äù in June 2018. But after this screening, Morse, believing in the Japanese concept of Kaizen, known in English as continuous improvement, added many additional edits to the film that was then rebranded as EuroTrump. The film discusses the rise of Twitter in politics, as Morse shows how Wilders bypasses traditional forms of media to go straight to \\"the people.\\" The film begins with Morse soliciting Wilders' involvement. Morse has said that Wilders is \\"actually much smarter than Trump\\" and \\"knows what he's doing\\". The film was screened at the International Film Festival in Ferrara, Italy. EuroTrump was subsequently released on Amazon and Hulu in the United States on June 30, 2018. =Koch Brothers Projects = In August, 2019, Variety reported that Morse purchased scripted and non-fiction rights to Daniel Schulman's book Sons of Wichita on the Koch Brothers. =In the Cold Dark Night = On July 14, 2020, Entertainment Weekly reported that Morse directed, produced, and wrote In the Cold Dark Night, a documentary on the racist murder of Timothy Coggins and its 35-year aftermath. Style Morse has said that working effectively with small budgets and limited time are important in making modern documentaries that deliver impact, as 24-hour news coverage and the rise of social media means that documentaries must cover ground quickly. This was why he initially released EuroTrump, originally called Wilders, only three months after the Dutch elections. He believes in a no frills approach to making documentaries while maintaining the highest quality in productions. Commenting on EuroTrump, he said, \\"We only shoot the scenes we need, and never use more crew than we absolutely have to.\\" References External links * Category:Living people Category:21st- century American businesspeople Category:American documentary film producers Category:21st-century American journalists Category:American founders Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of Green Templeton College, Oxford Category:Alumni of Sa√Ød Business School ","title":"Stephen Robert Morse"},{"id":"56937292","text":"Claudio De Vincenti in 2016 Claudio De Vincenti (born 28 October 1948) is an Italian politician, economist and University professor.

Until 1881 (until Kasiski's death), the exhibition grew considerably and numbered 702 pieces. After his death the collection was sold and gave rise to the Ethnological Museum (germ. Ethnologisches Museum) in Berlin (Dahlem). The museum was established half a century later when the historical interests were again enlivened by the ceremonial celebrations of the 600th anniversary of Szczecinek creation in 1910. In the autumn of 1913, mayor K. Sasse, established the Museum Society. The association members included well-known citizens of the city of Szczecinek: K. T√ºmpel, E.

The majority of the romanesque churches in this region of Slovakia is from this period. The two-tower design though makes this church unique on the ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov. The only similar one is the church of the Benedictine Abbey of Diakovce. The original face of the church is unknown. It was a single-nave building with a two-tower facade. What the sanctuary once looked like is not known. It is probable that it had the form of an apse with a semi-circular ending, like in the neighboring villages of Mierovo and Al≈æbetin Dvor, or with a straight end, like in the neighboring village of Hubice. The church is not a classic brick building because the foundations and the lower part of the towers along with other architectural details are made of stone. The existing polygonal presbytery replaced the apse in the 14th century. An earthquake with the epicentre in Kom√°rno struck the church in 1590. The impaired structure caused the northern tower to collapse. It was rebuilt and simultaneously the original single-nave space was arched with two supporting pillars which changed it into a two-naved space. The northern nave was built out and a two-storey building with a square ground plan was added to the southern tower. The medieval character of the church was enhanced during its renovation in the 1960s and 1970s when the neo-gothic southern entrance hall was removed and the first floor of the southern tower received a pair of composite windows.

Early life In early life, Treeby followed his father into the family business. In the late 1820s, he amassed a number of building plots on the St John's Wood estate, where he began building low- density dwellings, known as villas, including Devonshire Villa, the home of the poet Thomas Hood. He was also involved in the construction of archways and sewers for the London Underground's first railway as part of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Political career Upon the recommendation and support of Benjamin Disraeli‚Äîthe then-Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Prime Minister‚ÄîTreeby stood for election as a Conservative for the corrupt borough Lyme Regis, where he had been buying properties for development, at the 1859 general election. During campaigning, Treeby bribed electors‚Äîwho otherwise \\"taunted\\" him from having \\"risen for the people\\"‚Äîleading to a tie with his rival William Pinney, only settled when the local mayor added an additional vote to the Liberal candidate once polling had closed, blaming a \\"slow-running watch\\". Treeby remained in the constituency, purchasing Highcliffe House in Dorset and becoming the local squire. He stood for election again in 1868, with a platform of ridding the town's sewage problems for free, while also bribing electors with up to ¬£100, and was successfully elected. In Parliament, he loyally supported the Conservative Party, although he also rebelled on votes relating to parliamentary and local government franchises, siding with the Liberal and philosopher John Stuart Mill, both speaking for and voting for Mill's amendments. He also amended the Conservative Reform Act 1867 bill, requiring overseers of elections to publish lists of ratepayers in arrears and in danger of losing their rote to vote. Yet, he also attempted to make public secret land deals between \\"resident country gentleman\\" and railway companies saw him rebuked by fellow Conservatives. Treeby later ended up at loggerheads with his former ally, Disraeli, when the 1868 Scottish Reform Bill saw an additional seat granted to Scotland at the expense of Lyme Regis, whose parliamentary representation was transferred to Dorset. Treeby was unseated and did not seek re-election elsewhere, ending his parliamentary career.

The official court record from 1948 states that at \\"October last\\", Gibson was 21 years and four months old. known professionally as Gay Gibson, was an actress who went missing during a sailing of a ship between Cape Town in South Africa and Southampton, England, in October 1947. The criminal case that followed was known as The Porthole Murder, as the man who would be convicted of killing her admitted that he had pushed her body out of the porthole in her cabin into the Atlantic Ocean. He claimed that they had engaged in consensual sex and that she had died of an apparent sudden illness; he had then panicked and thrown her body out of the cabin porthole. Whilst James Camb acknowledged that pushing Gibson's body through the ship's porthole was \\"a beastly thing to do\\", he always strenuously denied having killed her, insisting that she had either choked or suffocated whilst the two were in bed together. Camb was convicted of Gibson's murder and sentenced to death by hanging, but a legal move to suspend the death penalty for all crimes in Britain meant he served 11 years in jail for the crime. He denied killing her for the rest of his life. The case attracted widespread attention at the time, drawing parallels with film noir and Agatha Christie novels. Even Winston Churchill commented on the outcome of the case, stating his regret that the punishment of Camb had been commuted to a lesser sentence. Background Eileen Isabella Ronnie 'Gay' Gibson was a 21-year old actress who was travelling back to England on the Union-Castle Line ship, MV Durban Castle, in October 1947. 'Gay' Gibson was her stage name and she had been on a theatre tour in South Africa with Doreen Mantle. Gibson was returning to London (where she was living) to perform in theatre at the West End. Her presence on board came to the attention of James Camb (born 16 December 1916), a 30-year oldMany sources list Camb as being 31 years-old; but this is based upon his age at the time of the trial in March 1948. When Gibson died, he was yet to reach his 31st birthday. steward on the liner. Gibson had been accommodated in cabin 126, B deck, which was in first- class. Camb was seen associating with Gibson, which was against company regulations, and he had been reprimanded over this by a senior officer. The ship had set sail on 10 October and on the 17th, after a night of dancing, she was escorted home by two friends at 11:30 pm. Sometime around 3:00 am the following morning, the duty watchman, a man called Frederick Steer,Some sources state the duty watchman was James Murray, but the official court record states it was Steer who responded to the summons. was awakened by a summons which had been activated from cabin 126. When he arrived at the cabin, he noted that two lights were lit outside Gibson's cabin, one red and one green. One light indicated that the duty steward had been called, whilst the other meant that the duty stewardess had been requested also. Steer thought this strange as usually only one person would be summoned. Steer's knock at the door was answered by Camb who only half-opened the door and informed him that everything was alright. The duty watchman left as he assumed that as a deck steward, Camb had arrived before him to help the passenger. (Maxtone- Graham and others dispute this saying that the duty watchman believed Camb had made good on his boast to sleep with a passenger). In the morning, the female steward for Gibson's deck, Eileen Field, came to clean her room. She noticed that the bunk was empty, stains on the sheets and the porthole was open. Later, the officer in command of the ship, Captain Patey, interviewed Camb who initially denied any involvement in Gibson's disappearance. When told that the duty watchman saw him at the door, Camb relented and told a story that neither the captain or the ship's doctor could believe. Camb stated that during sexual intercourse, Gibson had died and in a fit of abject panic, because he stood to lose his job and family, Camb pushed Gibson through the porthole. At the time, the ship was off the coast of West Africa, heading north.Some sources state the ship was off the coast of West Africa. Captain Patey ordered the ship to turn around and to scour the water for Gibson's body. Patey also contacted the Union Castle Line offices in London asking for the ship to be met by the police when it arrived in Southampton due to \\"complications\\". A return cable was sent to Patey instructing him to \\"padlock and seal off the room; disturb nothing.\\" When the ship docked at Cowes Roads in Southampton, police officers were waiting to question Camb who had been confined to his cabin by the ship's crew. Southampton Police were assisted by the Metropolitan Police on the case and forensic evidence was examined at the Metropolitan Police's laboratory at Hendon. This was not uncommon at the time; the Southampton Police Force was quite small and so they asked for help from Scotland Yard.The Southampton Police was merged with other forces in 1967 to become the Hampshire Constabulary. The police in the United Kingdom were involved as even though the murder took place off the coast of West Africa (Portuguese Guinea at the time, now Guinea-Bissau) it was a British ship under British authority, so the prosecution was brought by the British authorities. On Monday 27 October 1947, the Southern Daily Echo reported that James Camb, a deck steward from the Durban Castle, had been remanded in custody and charged with \\"Murder on the high seas\\". Trial and aftermath The trial in Winchester was an unusual one, since it was labelled by some as the first case in English Law whereby a prosecution was sought without a victim's body. This has been pointed out to be untrue as there was a case thirteen years earlier where a father (Thomas Davidson) was convicted of murdering his son (John) and even further back is the Campden Wonder case.In the book \\"First and Lasts and Only's; Crime\\", it states that Camb was the first British person convicted of a murder without a body. The case also gained some interest due to it mirroring a plot of a crime novel. Richard Latto described the story as having all the hallmarks of an Agatha Christie piece: \\"a young actress, a dashing steward, romance and a suspicious death on the high seas.\\" During the trial, it was revealed that pathologist Denis Hockling had discovered a urine stain on the sheets from cabin 126. It was stated by the Crown Pathologist that involuntary urination is something that occurs during strangulation. Hockling argued that it could be as a result of natural causes. The contents, walls and porthole section from cabin 126 on the Durban Castle, were removed by the police and used as exhibits in the court case. When Camb took the stand, the prosecution barrister asked him if he considered himself an honest man. Camb replied, \\"I think so, sir.\\" It was then proven in court that Camb had changed his story six times in what Camb defended as self-preservation. When asked about pushing Gibson's body through the porthole, Camb acknowledged that it was \\"beastly conduct.\\" After a four day hearing, the jury deliberated for 45 minutes and returned with a guilty verdict. Camb was sentenced to death by Justice Hilbery on 22 March 1948. However, the execution was not carried out because Parliament was considering the abolition of the death penalty at the time and the Home Secretary commuted all pending death sentences while the matter was discussed. This prompted Winston Churchill to comment that \\"The House of Commons has, by its vote, saved the life of the brutal lascivious murderer who thrust the poor girl he had raped and assaulted through a porthole of the ship to the sharks.\\" An appeal was lodged and heard in April 1948, but was denied. Camb was released from prison in 1959, but he was recalled to prison after being convicted of a number of indecent assaults of young girls. He was released again in 1978. He died in July 1979 from heart failure. Eileen Gibson's body was never found. In popular culture Several books have been written about Gibson's death, and while most have been factual, some have taken the story as a basis for a novel. \\"The Finest Type of English Womanhood\\" by Rachael Heath uses the Porthole Murder as a backstory to her novel detailing the lives of Gibson and her fictional friend, Laura Trelling. The title of the book is taken from a line spoken by Gibson's mother in court when asked to describe her daughter. In 1991, the Radio 4 series, Murder Most Foul profiled the killing with dramatisations. A 2011 biography of Sid James, the Carry On film star, forwarded the theory that Gay Gibson was returning to England to find Sid James, as she was his jilted lover. Cliff Goodwin's biography is the only piece written about the comic star that mentions this theory. Other authors have debunked it. Some people continue to have doubts about Camb's guilt. In 2018, the BBC broadcast a short documentary programme about the killing and asked whether or not Camb was guilty. The 30-minute programme was first aired on the BBC News Channel in March 2018. In the programme, Doreen Mantle, a fellow actress, details how she had seen Gibson faint and go blue around the lips. This was also attested to at the trial by the theatre manager Hilary Gilbert. The proposal of Gibson being ill was put to Gibson's mother during the trial of James Camb, but she flatly denied that her daughter was in ill-health. During the Second World War, Gibson enlisted herself in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and during July 1946, a junior ATS officer reported being called out to a Private Gibson who was on her bed with her back arched, unable to breathe with her tongue at the back of her throat. Gibson would later state to the ATS officer that she had had one of her \\"turns\\".

There, she meets the various armies of the Sengoku era, all of whom are members of the Gekka Tribe, mainly supernatural creatures such as vampires, werewolves and oni. Yuzuki is special in that her blood possesses an ability to initiate \\"Awakenings\\" of the members of the Gekka Tribe to allow them to unleash the latent power of their respective race, which increases their strength greatly and virtually becomes a decisive trump card in battle. She is tasked by a certain Himemiko to unite Shinga, a mysterious woman whose blood possessed the same qualities, in hopes of being able to return to her original world. =Vampires/Toyotomi Army= ; : :The general of the Toyotomi army. Previously, he was a peasant who rose to be under the care of Nobunaga, only to separate due to a turn of events, and now views him as an archenemy. While appearing playful and light-hearted on the surface, he possesses an extremely crafty and ruthless side, which gives him the advantage in battle. He enjoys teasing Yuzuki, affectionately calling her his \\"bride\\", and has a pet monkey named Toukichi who is always by his side. In the manga and anime series, he is the male lead. ; : :The most level-headed and logical of the Toyotomi army, he is known for being extremely polite, diligent, and efficient with his work, specialising in filling in the routine, day-to-day tasks Hideyoshi frequently neglects. ; : :Hideyoshi's trusted advisor, the Toyotomi army's main strategist and Hanbee's best friend. Always calm and quiet, he was the one who advised Hideyoshi to break away from Nobunaga previously. ; : :The Toyotomi army's other strategist and Kanbee's best friend. He is characterised by his red umbrella, which he carries around with him everywhere, and the various butterfly patterns on his clothing. Despite his gentle and almost feminine appearance, he shares the same trait as Hideyoshi in being extremely reckless. Whenever Hideyoshi is bored, the two often play Go together. ; : :The Toyotomi army's main fighter. Cheerful and optimistic, he is characterised by the many scars on his bare chest and his reckless behaviour. While poor at thinking and strategising, his lack of hesitation and spirit makes him a great fighter on the battlefield. =Vampires/Oda Army= ; : :The general of the Oda army and famed all over Shinga as \\"The Demon King of the Sixth Heaven\\" for his ruthless and cold demeanour. As his name portrays, he is unafraid to take risks and does not worry about how people view him, as his eyes are solely focused on uniting Shinga. He is very possessive of Yuzuki and his commanders are his biggest fans. ; : :The kind, gentlemanly thinker in the Oda army, who mainly serves as an information relayer and reporter to Nobunaga. Previously when the Toyotomi army was still under the Oda army, he betrayed Nobunaga but failed to kill him, instead earning the latter's praise. Since then, out of guilt, he has continued to serve faithfully as his position. ; : :The youngest commander, and the first to warm up to Yuzuki in the Oda army. He deeply respects Nobunaga and helps out around the castle whenever he can, whether it is something as simple and gruelling as housework. Like Hanbee, he has a very feminine appearance. ; : :The Oda army's main fighter, who often goes head-to- head with Toshiie in battle. While he may appear rough and violent on the battlefield, he actually harbours a very emotional and kind heart, and is often very concerned over Yuzuki's adaptation to life in Shinga due to her coming from another world. ; : :A commander in the Oda army who specialises in observing the battlefield. He carries a sharp tongue to his fellow commanders and often reprimands Yuzuki for her carelessness and forgetfulness. Like Nobunaga, he is very possessive of her. =Werewolves/Uesugi Army= ; : :The highly righteous and dignified general of the Uesugi army. His most distinguishing characteristic is his strong belief in his morals, which he bases his army's goals upon. He is very traditional and enjoys activities such as poetry and playing the biwa. ; : :A commander in the Uesugi army known for his strength in battle. While brash and poor at calculations, he harbours a kind and helpful heart when it comes to his fellow comrades. A running gag is when he always requests for Kagemochi's help when it comes to dealing with women, in particular Yuzuki. ; : :The Uesugi army's resident \\"smooth man\\" due to his politeness and main strategist. He is easily suspicious of unfamiliar people, making him out to be very intelligent and cautious. He is also very shrewd when it comes to dealing with others and is highly aware of what goes on in the castle. A running gag is when Kageie always requests for his help when it comes to dealing with women, in particular Yuzuki. ; : :Kenshin's foster child. Due to him being the future heir to the Uesugi clan, he has a lot of pressure and expectations placed on him, often causing him to have moments of self-doubt. His personality is relatively similar to his father's in that they are both very gentle and serious when it comes to duty, but he tends to be a lot more trusting. He is also the first to warm up to Yuzuki upon her arrival in the Uesugi army. ; : :A commander in the Uesugi army known for his strong suit in diplomacy. While appearing rough and stern at first glance, he simply just has a harsh way of talking, a strong sense of responsibility and plenty of confidence in himself and his comrades, which often give encouragement to the army. =Werewolves/Takeda Army= ; : :The general of the Takeda army. Passionate and warm, he carries himself with great pride as the leader, but actually suffers from an incurable disease, which he takes pills to suppress. He harbours a rivalry with Kenshin, and has a hobby of making nice-smelling sachets, which he often gifts to Yuzuki. ; : :The youngest and most hot-blooded commander of the Takeda army. He is often extremely active and frequently trains to improve his strength with Nobuharu in the gardens. Being the youngest and the most \\"innocent\\", he is often teased whenever it comes to contact with Yuzuki. ; : ; : :The shy commander and primary herbalist of the Takeda army, who is also responsible for making the pills Shingen frequently consumes. His eyes are always closed and due to his weak presence, he often surprises his comrades by seemingly appearing next to them suddenly. He kindly offers to teach Yuzuki how to be a herbalist when she enters the Takeda army. ; : :The brusque and good-natured commander of the Takeda army. He is primarily seen training Masakage and his strength in battle is well-known. =Werewolves/Sanada Army= ; : :The kind-hearted and warm general of the Sanada army, and also Nobuyuki's younger brother. Previously, the Sanada army was under the Takeda army, but he chose to separate after deciding that his fellow commanders were more precious to him. He is well- known for being openly generous, which is uncharacteristic of a warlord. ; : :The second-in-command of the Sanada army and Yukimura's older brother. He often reprimands Yukimura whenever the latter gets too reckless and is commonly the one that has to step in whenever Sasuke and Saiz≈ç argue. ; : :A ninja in the Sanada army noted for his wind techniques and childlikeness. He often quarrels with Saiz≈ç. ; : :A ninja in the Sanada army noted for his earth techniques and narcissism. He often quarrels with Sasuke. ; : : A ninja in the Sanada army noted for his use of two chained sickles, which is an uncommon weapon. Unlike his two energetic partners, he is often sleepy, air-headed, calm, and has a very poor sense of direction. =Werewolves/Date Army= ; : :The crafty and ruthless general of the Date army. Known as the \\"One-eyed Werewolf\\" due to his eyepatch and hair covering his right eye, he harbours a sharp tongue, but in actuality has a soft heart. These were brought about by his education that a commander must always say the contrary of what he feels. Due to the Date army's small size, he is determined to make a name for themselves out there and is unafraid of stooping to methods like manipulation and backstabbing. He is also an extremely good cook and practises falcon- hunting. ; : :The childlike and youngest commander of the Date army. Playful and energetic, he is considered a prodigy for his battle skills and abilities at his age, which can make him sometimes a bit arrogant. He often trains with Koj≈´r≈ç. ; : :The oldest commander of the Date army, who often acts like a mother to the other two. He is often seen training Shigezane or handling routine tasks in the castle. Whenever Masamune feels doubtful of himself, he performs the flute for him. =Ogres/M≈çri Army (Game only)= ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : Media =Anime= A 12-episode anime television series adaptation by Typhoon Graphics aired between October 3 and December 26, 2017.

It boasts a cartoony steampunk setting placed in an imagined version of Agram, Austria-Hungary where characters are replaced by animals. The adventure follows Viktor, a boar disillusioned with his role as a janitor, and sets on a journey to become the next Emperor of Austria-Hungary. It was first released on Steam in March, 2017. Gameplay The game's core follows the classic point n' click adventure formula, but with some innovations on its own. For instance, the game is notable for its use of gibberish in recorded dialogue, which is supplemented with subtitles in English. It also uses records as collectibles, which could be used to change the game's musical backdrop. The entire game is littered with minigames often utilizing arcade instances and reflexes. Development The game went through an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign, but was developed despite this due to the investment and passion of the developers in the project. One of the developers explained the process for choosing the setting as \\"When we decided to fragment the game in multiple episodes, it was logical that Viktor starts in Zagreb, or Agram in Austria-Hungary, which is in Sven‚Äôs world an industrial zone in the style of early twentieth century, only with more robots and mobile phones, rather than cockroaches\\".

It is claimed that he was the first to manufacture cotton duck cloth. He was also father to attorney George Bemis. Bemis was one of the three sons of David Bemis, builder of the Bemis Dam in 1778, which powered the first paper mill on the Charles River. When the elder Bemis died in 1790, his estate - including snuff and gristmills in Watertown, as well as a paper mill on the Newton side of the river - was divided among his three sons. Seth Bemis was then studying for admission to Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1795. After graduation, he briefly worked as a lawyer, then entered the employment of his sole surviving brother Luke, and shortly after becoming 21 purchased a half-interest in the Watertown mills as his brother's partner. On July 15, 1798, he bought out his brother, the partnership was dissolved, and Bemis became sole proprietor of the Watertown mills. For the next few years he experimented with the production of chocolate (which manufacture eventually went to the Walter Baker & Company of Dorchester), and the grinding of grain, dye goods, and medicinal roots. In 1803 he built a cotton factory as an addition to his mill, and placed within it machinery for carding and spinning cotton and for making cotton warps. To clean the cotton, he invented his own machinery, which he called \\"the devil\\"; it was very similar to Eli Whitney's cotton gin, which had not been properly patented. His textile fabrics, particularly his popular \\"Bemis warp\\", were consigned for some years to Isaac Bowers' dry goods store in Boston. On February 28, 1806, Bemis petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for tax relief as follows: \\"The subscriber has at a very considerable expense lately erected a cotton mill in Watertown and wishes for some encouragement in his undertaking that may in part counterbalance the many inconveniences and losses which so frequently accompany enterprises which are but experiments. The subscriber flatters himself as the business has become very extensive in a neighboring State and as large quantities of cotton yarn are now being sent to our markets for sale that the General Court will In their wisdom see fit to place him on an equal standing with other manufacturers of this article in this State and exempt his cotton mill from taxes for seven years\\". His petition was granted in 1807 for a period of five years, and that same year Bemis put into operation a number of hand looms and began to manufacture sheeting, shirting, satinet, and bed ticking. In 1809 he decided manufacture of a new type of fabric from cotton yarns, namely \\"cotton duck\\" or sail cloth. Before this time, sail cloth had been made only from linen or flax yarn. The first sails were made from Bemis' cotton duck in Boston in November 1809, and his duck was used extensively during the War of 1812. It furnished the sails for the USS Constitution (old Ironsides) when it was being repaired. For a time, the cotton duck business was so profitable that Bemis not only enlarged his mills at Watertown but contracted for the labor of convicts in the Charlestown State Prison, where he set up a large number of looms. The manufacture of duck was discontinued in 1816. Sometime before 1810, Bemis introduced machinery for grinding and cutting glass and for polishing lights for lighthouses, as well as for insertion in the decks of vessels and binnacle lights, under a patent granted in 1809 to Captain Winslow Lewis (who was also his selling agent for cotton duck). In the fall of 1812, Bemis and an \\"English expert\\" built a gas house at the east end of the old Watertown mill, and began extracting gas from coal and using it to illuminate his factory. However, because the gas went through tin pipes, which it corroded, the \\"unsavory material\\" (gas) leaked and was odorous, non-economical, and dangerous. Its use was discontinued after two years. In 1821 Bemis purchased from his brother Luke and Caleb Eddy the Bemis Mill on the Newton side of the Charles River, and thus became sole owner of the whole water power. Soon after, he built the rolling stone-dam, unique in the United States (the only other known example is near Warwick Castle in England). Precisely how it worked is not clear, but it seems that the height of the dam was controlled by a mechanically-operated drum that could be rolled up and down the inclined face of the stone dam. Soon after the dam was installed, his upstream neighbor, the Boston Manufacturing Company in Waltham, complained that the river was backing up to its waterwheels and impeding their operation. The company subsequently paid Bemis $12,000 to reduce the height of the dam by a foot. Bemis continued to operate the mills on both sides of the river until 1848, sometimes alone, sometimes with others, notably his brother Luke. His son, Seth Jr., was largely responsible for the success of the dye works, and took over the management of all the mills on both sides of the river when Bemis died.

History  In 1971 Nelly Seiler Filipson (1926‚Äì2012), sensitized by her personal background, created a rehabilitation centre in Laeken for children with mental disabilities. She named it Nos Pilifs from an anagram of her name. This centre still receives some fifty disabled children up to the age of 13. Other organizations have been created to meet the needs of disabled persons who attended the centre. That is how the leisure club was established in 1980, \\"La Ferme Nos Pilifs\\" as a company that hires people with disabilities in 1984, the Maison Nos Pilifs providing accommodation and support service in 1985, \\"le Potelier des Pilifs\\" day centre in 1989, the \\"Ados Pilifs\\" secondary school for autistic children in 2011, the \\"Villa Pilifs\\" hostel in 2015, and soon \\"Les Piloux\\" inclusive children's nursery. All these private nonprofit organizations share the same philosophy: acceptance of difference and inclusion of people with disabilities.  The centre  Nos Pilifs centre is a pre-primary and primary school with specialized education for children with pervasive developmental disorders (specialized in type 3 ‚Äì autism) or with mental retardation or deficiency. The school is part of the non-confessional network. Nos Pilifs centre provides multidisciplinary care in speech therapy, psychomotor education, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and behavioural psychology.  Ferme Nos Pilifs ASBL  The farm was created in 1984, on the initiative of Mrs Filipson and Benoit Ceysens in response to a lack of employment for disabled people in the north of Brussels. The farm is now a recognized company with disabled employees certified by the Cocof. With social and ecological purposes, 140 out of its 180 employees are disabled. It works a 12-acre long field in Neder-Over-Heembeek in the north of Brussels, with an animal park, a garden centre, different plots, a grocery shop, a brewery and a conditioning workshop for organic dry food. Eight teams of gardeners also offer various gardening services. Children can spend their school breaks at the farm, and school groups can visit it on field trips at any time of the year. Through those various activities, Nos Pilifs Farm showcases disabled people's skills and gives them a real role in their neighbourhood.  Accessibility  Bus line , stop Nos Pilifs.

Route  Pituresque spot on the Evansville and Eastern Electric Railway The railroad extended a distance of from Newburgh, Indiana, which had a population of about 1500 people, to Rockport, having about 3500 inhabitants, with a spur north to Richland, Indiana. However, traffic arrangements had been made with the Evansville Suburban & Newburgh Railroad, whereby railcars were operated into Evansville over the tracks of the latter company. The railroad passed through a rich farming country. Corn was raised on the river bottom farms on one side, while the land to the north was devoted to wheat raising. Wheat, which took one of the first prizes at the Chicago World's Fair, was cultivated on land near the line in Warrick County. Previously, farmers of the region traversed have been compelled to haul their grain distances up to to Rockport, Boonville and Newburgh. Those near the river made shipments by way of unreliable river boats. Practically all these shipments from the territory from the line were subsequently carried over it. Before the railroad was completed the farmers made such insistent demands that arrangements were made to haul car-load lots of grain by means of the construction locomotive and about two hundred car loads were hauled. The railroad was practically a farmers' line, and the greater portion of the receipts were derived from the farmers. There was, however, considerable through passenger traffic between Evansville and Rockport. The steam-railroad route between the two cities was long as against by the electric line. The time over the steam road was not to be considered, since very unreliable connections were made at Rockport Junction. During the first month's operation of the railroad an investigation showed that only five through steam-road tickets had been sold between Rockport and Evansville, and in three instances business along the line compelled the purchasers to take this route. Owensboro, Kentucky, a city of about 15,000 people, located on the Ohio River, below Rockport, was also served by the line through boats which made connections with trains at Rockport. Other than the terminals the only towns on the main line were Yankeetown and Hatfield, with about 400 people each. Eureka, Indiana, with probably 600 people, lied about south of the line, and Richland, on the spur already referred to, had a population of about 800 inhabitants.  Track and roadway  Trestle over a ravine near Yankeetown All of the route, but particularly the western portion, was very picturesque. For about after leaving Newburgh the track was laid over bluffs on the bank of the Ohio River. The railroad then crossed behind the hills and passed over Cypress Creek on truss steel construction long. The only other steel structure on the line was that over Pigeon Creek, which was in length. Both rested on concrete abutments. Near Yankeetown the tracks were carried over a ravine on a wood trestle which was planned to be displaced later by a fill. The heaviest grading was necessary near Yankeetown where some 22-ft. cuts were made. East of Yankeetown the country is comparatively level. All cuts were made 22 ft. wide at the bottom and fills are 14 ft. at the top. The track is laid with 70-lb/yard (35 kg/m) rails on oak ties, obtained largely from the neighboring country. The entire railroad was bonded with brazed bonds, the work being done by the Electric Railway Improvement Company, of Cleveland, Ohio. Sidings varied in length from to and were located at about 3-mile intervals. All passing sidings were double end; others are stub end. The sidings were placed more frequently than otherwise to provide for the simultaneous operation of freight trains and passenger cars. Throughout its length the road was ballasted with gravel taken from the bed of the Ohio River, just above Newburgh. The gravel was dug up and loaded into barges by a dredge boat, and a tug towed the barges down the river to a coalmine incline, which extended over the tracks of the electric line. The coal-mine engines were used to pull small cars of gravel up the incline, and these cars were dumped, either directly into the ballast cars or into a hopper underneath the incline. The gravel was almost entirely free from sand and makes an excellent roadbed. As the road was built partly for freight traffic, heavy grades were eliminated wherever possible. There was, however, one short grade of 2.4 per cent near Yankeetown.  Overhead lines  A long tangent on the Evansville and Eastern Railway The trolley poles, which were of chestnut, and long, were spaced apart on tangents and as close as on curves. The poles were always placed on the outside of curves and are braced, either by deadmen, as shown in one of the accompanying illustrations, or by guy anchors. As no high-tension wires were carried on the poles, unnecessary height of poles was avoided by using a tubular steel bracket braced on the under side. A single trolley of No. 000 round wire was used. Telephone wires and feeders were carried on a cross-arm just below the bracket. Shaw nonarcing lightning arresters grounded to steel rods were placed three to the mile. All of the overhead material with the exception of the lightning arresters was furnished by the Ohio Brass Company. Power station and feeder system The power station was located about midway of the length of the line, at Hartfield. It was a brick structure, divided into a boiler and engine room by a transverse wall. The boiler room contained two 300 hp B. & W. boilers served by one steel stack. In the engine room are installed two 375 kW units each, consisting of a Westinghouse compound non-condensing engine and a Westinghouse 600-volt generator. The switchboard was of Western Electric Company manufacture and consisted of two generator and two feeder panels. Water for the boilers was obtained from wells sunk near the power house, and coal was hauled in the company's cars from mines at Newburgh. A 500,000 circ. mil feeder left the power house in each direction. The feeders continued at this size to points from the station where they are reduced in size to 350,000 circ. mil. These smaller feeders were carried to within of the ends of the line.  Repair shops  A brick repair shop adjacent to the power house at Hatfield contained three storage tracks and space along one wall for the installation of requisite machinery.  Rolling stock  The road was equipped with five passenger cars built by the American Car Company. The cars were long over all, wide and seated forty-eight people. The inside finish was dark oak. All were built with a small baggage compartment at one end and were intended for double-end operation. They were equipped with four Westinghouse 101-J motors of 50 hp each, and these were mounted on 21 E-1 Brill trucks. K-14 controllers were used. The cars were provided with Westinghouse Traction Brake Company straight air brakes, and Peter Smith hot-water heaters. They were painted a Big Four yellow, which color has been adopted by the company as a standard and is being used wherever possible. Package freight was hauled in an express car of practically the same dimensions as the passenger cars. For handling heavy freight a steam locomotive and twelve standard steam-railroad freight cars were employed. Passenger cars were operated between Evansville and Rockport on an hourly schedule. The run required 1 hour and 20 minutes and three cars were employed. The express car made two round trips per day. At Rockport an agent was employed who gave all of his time to the company. In the other towns the agent was employed on a commission basis. Tickets were sold at approximately 2 cents per mile. An extra charge of 25 cents per piece was made for baggage. The operating offices, which were now located in Evansville, were planned to be ultimately moved to Hatfield. The road was constructed and partially financed by the Tennis Company, of Cincinnati, with C. H. Battin as engineer in charge. The officers of the Evansville & Eastern Traction Company were initially: *W. H. McCurdy, president *W. L. Sonntag, vice-president *M. S. Sonntag, secretary and treasurer *C. H. Battin, general manager * F. C. Storton, superintendent The company and the Evansville & Mt. Vernon Electric Railway were held and operated by the Evansville Railways Company.  Traffic  Including the two terminal towns the population along the line was not more than 400 per mile (640 per km), taken 2¬Ω miles (4 km) back on each side of the track. In the Northern portion of Indiana very few lines have been built through territories not showing a population of twice or three times as great. However, in estimating the possible earnings of the Evansville & Eastern Traction Company it must be remembered that the territory was entirely dependent on the line both for passenger and freight service, and that this exclusive territory extended back from the line in some places as great a distance as . Moreover, it must be remembered that Evansville, though not on the line proper, must, under the initial operating conditions, be regarded as a terminal. During the first few months operation the receipts have been such as to justify the belief that in electric railway construction there has been too great a tendency to parallel already existing steam lines, rather than to push out through thickly settled farming country, remote from steam roads. The operation of the railroad was discontinued in 1938.Bill Vandervoort: Interurban Railways in Indiana (excluding Chicago/Northwest Indiana area).

Following the end of the war he was acquitted of war crimes charges and promoted to head of the City Police. Bourantas went to become an MP for the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture and chief of the Hellenic Fire Service. Biography Nikolaos Bourantas was born in 1900. During the course of the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II, he commanded the 700-man motorized unit of the City Police, which came to be known as \\"Bourantades\\" (ŒúœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ, \\"Bourantas' men\\"). The unit actively participated in security operations against urban resistance groups in Athens, most notably in the suburbs of Kokkinia, Kallithea, Vyronas, and Kaisariani. Bourantas and his men engaged in arrests, torture and executions of alleged resistance members, transferring a number of suspects to the German authorities who in turn sent them to concentration camps. Following the end of the war Bourantas was tried by the Special Collaborationist Court of Athens, with proceedings beginning on 20 November 1945. The chief of City Police Angelos Evert, among other high- ranking police officials, testified in Bourantas' defense. The trial ended with an acquittal of the accused, with the judge D. Golfinopoulos claiming that evidence provided by the persecution was inconclusive. Golfinopoulos judged that the violent suppression of anti-Axis demonstrations was conducted by the Bourantades in order to prevent Axis units from taking matters in their own hands, thus avoiding greater bloodshed, while on the occasion Bourantas followed orders while acting under duress. The case of the collaboration between Axis units and the City Police in the Kallithea security operation was ruled out as an unfortunate coincidence. Furthermore, Bourantas was pronounced innocent in the charge of collaborating with the Security Battalions and ignorant of the fact that his subordinates had handed suspects to the Germans. Finally Golfinopoulos inquired whether the defendant would seek monetary compensation from his accusers for moral injury, which Bourantas declined. Bourantas' release led to a public outcry over the judicial decision, which prompted the Minister of Public Order Konstantinos Rentis to call for the suspension of Bourantas from the police force and for his case to be reexamined. Nevertheless, Rentis' suggestions were not implemented. Afterwards Bourantas was promoted to head of City Police. Bourantas was elected into the Hellenic Parliament as a representative of the Metaxist Politically Independent Alignment for the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture constituency in the 1950 Greek legislative election. Between 1959 and 1964, Bourantas served as the head of the Hellenic Fire Service. Bourantas died on 16 January 1981, at the Evangelismos Hospital in Athens. He was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens.

The Limoilou dust controversy involves the Port of Quebec, St. Lawrence Stevedoring Ltd. and the residents of Quebec City, who claimed that the quality of their environment and their health had been degraded by dust emanating from ore transshipment at the nearby port. The controversy was triggered in October 2012 by the observation of red dust covering sections of the Vieux-Limoilou neighborhood. After documenting other similar incidents, residents filed two class-action suits against the Port of Quebec and St. Lawrence Stevedoring. In March 2018, St. Lawrence Stevedoring recognized its responsibility for the incidents, and agreed to compensate residents who could prove damages.  Chronology  Iron oxide, original composition of the red dust which fell in Limoilou. The controversy was triggered by a \\"storm of red dust\\" in October 2012, which left deposits of an uncertain nature on sidewalks, balconies and cars in the Limoilou and Saint- Sacrament neighborhoods. Urgence-Environnement, an intervention team from the provincial government's environmental ministry (then known by its French acronym MDDEFP), was immediately summoned to the area by residents. Several days later, St. Lawrence Stevedoring, which rented space at the Port of Quebec for transshipment of goods, confirmed that the red dust was composed of iron oxide from an iron ore transfer in the Beauport Bay area. The company also claimed that the dust storm was an isolated incident. On October 26, 2012, Limoilou residents collected dust samples to be analyzed in a private laboratory. Results showed that the dust contained high levels of iron, as well as other heavy metals including copper, nickel and zinc. With these findings in hand, residents directly confronted the mayor of Quebec City during a city council meeting. Additionally, the environmental ministry's findings led to the filing of a notice of non-conformity with St. Lawrence Stevedoring. In the following days, other residents contacted media outlets to share their observations about dust clouds around the Port of Quebec, saying that such incidents had taken place in the area on other occasions. Residents of the Cap-Blanc neighborhood had also been affected by the dust, adding that their frequency had been increasing over the previous few years. Furthermore, during summer 2012, residents of Levis, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River across from Quebec City, also observed clouds of red dust coming from the port on several occasions; deposits of dust had been noticed there as well. In the wake of the reports, media sources also revealed that the MDDEFP had been surveying the Port of Quebec's activities since 2003 due to its dust emissions. In November 2012, residents collected new dust samples in the Limoilou and Saint-Jean-Baptiste neighborhoods for analysis. Once again, the results showed elevated concentrations of heavy metals occasionally exceeding provincial and federal environmental standards; residents claimed that it was proof that metallic dust from the Port of Quebec was regularly emitted into the air of the surrounding neighborhoods. Shortly afterwards, St. Lawrence Stevedoring claimed that while the dust may have inconvenienced residents, it did not represent a health risk. These conclusions stemmed from analysis of the samples obtained by the MDDEFP, the results of which contrasted with those obtained by the residents. In December 2012, a web site compiling residents' observations regarding the Port of Quebec was created. In January 2013, in its annual report, the Port of Quebec recognized that the dust episode on October 26 was unfortunate and to be avoided in the future, while also emphasizing its isolated nature. In response, the MDDEFP issued a press release soliciting the port's assistance with its investigation. However, the Quebec Port Authority was hesitant to cooperate and did little to assist, instead challenging the applicability of provincial law in court. = A class-action suit is filed = On January 14, 2013, a request for authorization to submit a class-action suit was submitted by a Limoilou resident, looking to compensate residents affected by the October 26, 2012 dust episode and to require the Port of Quebec to modify its facility to prevent all dust emissions beyond its property. In March 2013, another suit was submitted by Limoilou residents towards the Port of Quebec after another dust episode. = The environmental ministry corroborates residents' findings = Dust cloud around transshipment operations at the Port of Quebec, observed May 31, 2013. In April 2013, the provincial environmental ministry (MDDEP) released test results of the concentration of various metals in the air in Limoilou, taken between 2000 and 2012. The results showed that in the majority of those years, the average nickel concentration exceeded environmental standards. From 2010 to 2012, the average concentration was 5.7 times above normal limits. The ministry concluded that the Port of Quebec was the source of the nickel, and issued a notice of non-compliance to St. Lawrence Stevedoring, which carried out nickel transshipment on Port property. St. Lawrence Stevedoring, while still calling into question its responsibility for air pollution in Limoilou, nevertheless presented an action plan to reduce its dust emissions. On June 16, 2013, another dust episode took place in Limoilou. St. Lawrence Stevedoring indicated that the water cannons used to capture dust from transshipments were not in operation at the time. On June 25, residents took note of additional dust coming from the Port, and a complaint was filed. An inspector from Urgence-Environnement arrived on the scene, but could not gain access to the site. The MDDEP subsequently sent a formal notice to St. Lawrence Stevedoring In August 2013, a new report was posted online by Limoilou residents, featuring further analysis of dust and air samples which showed that dust collected on outside surfaces in Limoilou continued to contain nickel concentrations exceeding public health standards. The report also presented analysis of air samples collected by the MDDEP at various locations in Quebec City, demonstrating that nickel was present in significant concentrations at locations more than five kilometers from the port. 2013 citizen demonstration for the right to live in a healthy environment. In light of the report's results, a request was made in court for the class-action suit filed in 2013 to be enlarged. Initially, the suit only concerned the October 26, 2012 dust episode, but the amendment included all subsequent episodes. The court rejected the request. In December 2013, following the publication of a study on nickel dust's effects on human health, the MDDEP tightened the province's limits for atmospheric concentration of the metal. However, as with all ports in Canada, the Port of Quebec is located on federal land. In the wake of the events, St. Lawrence Stevedoring filed an application to the Superior Court to exclude itself from Quebec's environmental standards. = More red dust = In January 2014, Limoilou residents witnessed more episodes of red dust. Following these allegations, the MDDEP carried out more sampling in Limoilou, the Port of Quebec launched an internal investigation and St. Lawrence Stevedoring distanced itself from all responsibility. Shortly afterwards, following data verification via sensors on its property, the Port of Quebec admitted to having detected higher concentrations of fine particles than usual a few days before the Limoilou residents' report, but still slightly below provincial limits. On May 1, 2014, the Le Soleil newspaper published MDDEP data regarding the atmospheric concentration of nickel in Limoilou and in the adjoining Vanier neighborhood. The data showed that between March 2011 and December 2013, levels were below provincial limits in Vanier, but consistently above the limits in Limoilou, despite a downward trend since fall 2011. = Class-action suit accepted = Also in May 2014, the Quebec Superior Court heard the request for a class-action suit filed by Limoilou residents against the Port of Quebec and St. Lawrence Stevedoring. The suit requested $150 million, in the form of 5,000 claims of $3,000 each. The request was accepted October 23, 2014. In January 2015, Limoilou residents obtained copies of reports, published in the 1980s, regarding the environmental repercussions of an eventual extension of the Port of Quebec. A 1981 report mentioned that \\"the open-air handling of bulk solids on the Beauport flats is a source of air and water pollution.\\" In the same report, the \\"dustiness\\" of the Limoilou neighborhood due to port activity had already been identified as problematic. A 1983 report added that air sampling stations on the port grounds had demonstrated suspended particle concentration levels above legal limits. For Limoilou residents working to stop the port's pollution of their neighborhood, the documents demonstrated that the dust issues were neither new nor rare, and that port administration had been aware of the situation. On January 17, 2015, media outlets reported that St. Lawrence Stevedoring and the Port of Quebec had received citations for obstructing the work of MDDEP inspectors. Also in January 2015, the MDDEP published information showing that levels of atmospheric concentration of nickel in Limoilou were above provincial limits on average one day per week between January and November 2014. = A second class-action suit against St. Lawrence Stevedoring = In August 2015, the Court authorized a second class-action suit against St. Lawrence Stevedoring. This suit was much larger than the first, covering damages caused by all dust incidents in Limoilou since 2010. On September 8, 2016, the Quebec Superior Court gave its decision concerning the applicability of provincial standards on Port of Quebec land, saying that only federal standards applied. In September 2017, an expert report commissioned by the Port of Quebec and Quebec Stevedoring criticized elements of the class action suit brought forth by V√©ronique Lalande and Louis Duchesne, questioning the methods by which the dust samples were collected. The report concluded that the ore transshipment at the port was only a marginal source of pollution in the central neighborhoods of Quebec City.

The position was introduced after the initial Arab conquest of Georgia in the mid-7th century, when Abbasid caliphs appointed emirs of Tbilisi. The ascendancy of emirs ended in 1122 when King David IV of Georgia seized the city following his decisive victory at Didgori. Thereafter, the emirs became subordinated to the Mechurchletukhutsesi (Finance Minister) of Georgian crown. In the 17th century, the term was replaced by Mouravi. The last amirtamira of Tbilisi was Giorgi Saakadze. One of the few attempts of third estate to gain power in feudal Georgia can be traced to Qutlu-Arslan, as a Finance Minister, he led a party who proposed an idea of limiting the royal power by a parliamentary-type legislature which, in the view of Qutlu Arslan and his followers, would be consist of two chambers: Darbazi (Royal Council) or an assembly that would meet occasionally to follow the developments in the kingdom, and Karavi, a legislature in permanent sessions. The dispute between the ‚Äúparty of Karavi‚Äù and that of the unlimited royal power concluded with the arrest of Qutlu Arslan. In retaliation, the latter‚Äôs supporters rose in rebellion, and marched to the Queen‚Äôs palace. Tamar agreed to release the oppositionist leader, but his ideas were never materialised. However some other historians believe that in addition to members of the higher secular and ecclesiastical nobility, the \\"Darbazi\\" now included representatives of the merchant-class, such as Abulasan.

A native of Edison, New Jersey, he attended Cardinal McCarrick High School and St. Joseph High School, where he played both basketball and football. Entering the college level, the 6-foot-4, 210-pound guard was a three-star basketball recruit. He drew national attention after helping the Ramblers reach the Final Four round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament.  Early life and high school  Townes was born in Edison, New Jersey to Bryant and Luisa Townes but grew up in the nearby city of Rahway. While in fifth grade, he moved to South Amboy, New Jersey. Townes began his high school years at Cardinal McCarrick High School in South Amboy, where he played basketball under head coach Joe Lewis. As a sophomore, he averaged 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, earning first-team All-County honors from The Star-Ledger and leading the team to a 22‚Äì7 record. At the time, he was being recruited by several major college programs, including Miami, Rutgers, and Virginia. Before his junior season, Townes announced that he would transfer to St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey, in pursuit of \\"bigger and better opportunities.\\" He joined a lineup that featured future National Basketball Association (NBA) players Karl-Anthony Towns and Wade Baldwin IV. As a senior, he averaged about 17 points, five rebounds, three assists, and two steals per game, being a third- team All-State pick by The Star-Ledger. His team, which was ranked the 12th best in the nation by USA Today, finished with a 30‚Äì2 record and won the state's Tournament of Champions for the first time in program history. He accumulated 1,863 points, the most in school history behind Jay Williams. Townes also saw success on the football field at St. Joseph, where he played the outside linebacker position. He drew interest from various college football programs, such as Penn State, Maryland, and Rutgers, but eventually chose to focus on basketball.  College career  A three-star recruit, Townes decided to start his college basketball career with the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights, turning down offers from Saint Peter's, South Alabama, Hartford, and Charleston Southern. In his freshman season for the Knights, he averaged 9.1 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. On December 29, 2015, against Towson, he recorded 18 points, six rebounds, and five steals, all season-bests. As a sophomore at Fairleigh Dickinson, Townes started in all 33 games, averaging 11.5 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.3 steals per game. He led the team to the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, where they lost to Florida Gulf Coast in the First Four round. After his second season in college, Townes announced that he transfer to play for the Loyola Ramblers.

Five to ten thousand Walloons emigrated to Sweden, mainly working in the steel industry. During the 1920s, trade unions presented them to Swedish workers as mythical models.  History  On 28 January 1613, the King of Sweden put an end to the Kalmar War and was forced to make an expensive peace with the King of Denmark. He had to borrow money to pay his debts. In 1616 he approached the Dutch, offering the abundant iron mines of Sweden as collateral. Louis de Geer, from Li√®ge, contacted the Besche brothers, one of whom, Guillaume de B√®che, had been established in Sweden since 1595 and was exploiting the iron works of Nyk√∂ping and Finsp√•ng with Walloons exiled from the Low Countries for religious reasons. From 1620, between 5,000 and 10,000 Walloons emigrated to Sweden for economic and religious reasons. The Swedes were amazed by their technical knowhow, which helped them to make great progress in the steel industry. Between 1620 and 1650, Swedish steel exports trebled, reaching 17,500 tons a year, in particular for the English navy. The Walloons‚Äô lifestyle was also ahead of Sweden‚Äôs, particularly with regard to hygiene. They remained separate from the Swedish population for a long time, jealously keeping their technical secrets until the end of the 18th century.  Legacy and recognition  Walloon immigrants were behind Swedish metallurgy from the 17th century onwards and the Walloon language remained spoken in some areas until the 19th century. The impact of Walloon immigration in Sweden was lasting, coming to be embodied in the myth of the Walloon trade-union hero, which corresponds neither to the historic reality of the 17th and 18th centuries nor to the reality of the 1920s in Sweden. Around 1920, at a time when the Walloon presence was fading, the newspaper of the Swedish metalworkers union gave birth to the myth of the Walloon worker, who was both strong and endowed with a deep class consciousness transposed into the past. This newspaper, Metallarbetaren, printed these surprising lines (June 3, 1922): > Walloons are stronger than the Flemings (the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of > Belgium), thinner, more nervous, healthier, and they live longer. Their > skill and their professionalism are superior to those of the Flemish. They > exceed the French in tenacity and enthusiasm - qualities which favoured > their immigration in Sweden. But their passionate rashness makes them look > like the French people. Thus was invented the myth of the Walloon capable of trade-union action, in particular by the strike, presented as a model to the Swedes. Anders Flor√©n and Math Isacson, in De fer et de feu, l‚Äô√©migration wallonne vers la Su√®de (2003), write: \\"there doubtless existed, in these difficult times of crisis, a strong need for models, and Walloons offered an ideal embodiment of the values which the labor union of the metallurgists intended to promote.\\"Anders Flor√©n and Maths Isacson (2003), De fer et de feu, l‚Äô√©migration wallonne vers la Su√®de, Louvain, pp. 271-286 (chapter \\"Le Wallon et les forges dans le discours politique su√©dois d‚Äôentre-deux-guerres\\").

He was co-President of the Politics Can Be Different (Lehet M√°s a Politika; LMP) party from 2016 to 2018, and has been a member of the National Assembly (MP) from the party's National List since 2016. Profession Hadh√°zy was born on 4 March 1974 in Debrecen into a Calvinist family. He finished his secondary studies at Le√∂vey Kl√°ra Gimn√°zium in P√©cs. He earned a degree of veterinary at the University of Veterinary Science in 1998. He conducted research for a semester at the University of Giessen, where passed the exams of pathology and food microbiology. He also worked for the Institute of Biology of the Semmelweis University, where studied cellular biology. He started his veterinary practice in Szeksz√°rd as an assistant. He worked as a professional manager in the Veterinary Center since 2001. He is the owner of the local central animal hospital since 2009. He specializes in pet internal medicine, laboratory diagnostics and oncology. Political career =Fidesz= √Åkos Hadh√°zy was a member of the Fidesz party. He became a local representative in Szeksz√°rd during the 2006 local elections. He was a member of the committee on the economy. He was re-elected in the 2010 local elections. After that he served on the committee on culture. He became nationally known in April 2013, after giving an interview to news portal HVG. In it he confirmed the claims by opposition politicians and journals that the ruling Fidesz government awarded national tobacco sales rights based on party connections, and favoring local pro-government politicians including the mayor of Szeksz√°rd, Istv√°n Horv√°th. Horv√°th denied the charges but HVG presented a leaked audio recording from an assembly of the local representative body, which strengthened Hadh√°zy's allegations. The news portal quoted Horv√°th who said it was most important that \\"applicants should be committed conservatives\\" and \\"socialist supporters must not win [at the tendering process]\\". =LMP= After the interview, Hadh√°zy left Fidesz and its caucus in June 2013, and continued his work as an independent representative. Hadh√°zy became affiliated with the left-wing green party Politics Can Be Different (LMP) by late 2013; he was the party's candidate for the individual parliamentary seat of Szeksz√°rd (Tolna County Constituency I) and came to the fourth place during the 2014 parliamentary election. Soon he officially joined the party. Hadh√°zy ran for the mayoral seat of Szeksz√°rd in the October 2014 local elections. Beside LMP, he was supported by the other left-wing parliamentary parties (MSZP, DK and Together) too. He was defeated by Fidesz candidate Rezs≈ë √Åcs with 5 percent difference (Horv√°th did not run again for the office). After that Hadh√°zy submitted a protest against the result in the Regional Court of P√©cs, presenting evidences about organized tours of voters. The submission was well founded and the court annulled the outcome of the election. A new mayoral election was held on 9 November 2014, and √Åcs again defeated Hadh√°zy, who obtained 42 percent of the vote. On 18 July 2015, Hadh√°zy was elected to the LMP's leadership. He launched a portal korrupcioinfo.hu and held weekly press conferences, where uncovered numerous alleged corruption cases involved Fidesz politicians and government‚Äîclose businessmen and bankers. After the LMP's most well-known politician, Andr√°s Schiffer announced his retirement from politics, Hadh√°zy was elected co-chair of the party on 16 July 2016, alongside Bernadett Sz√©l. He was also elected a Member of Parliament via the party's national list on 12 September 2016, replacing Schiffer. There he became a member of the Legislative Committee. Hadh√°zy criticized the Orb√°n government's migrant quota referendum campaign in October 2016; he called the referendum as \\"destructive\\", because it \\"whipped up panic-like fear\\" among the citizens, while distracting from the \\"collapsing health care\\" and the \\"looting of EU funds at state level\\". He also said Orb√°n \\"isolated himself internationally with his populist campaign of provocation\\". During the campaign period of the 2018 parliamentary election, Hadh√°zy was a strong advocate for cooperation among left-wing opposition parties despite the LMP's contradictory resolutions. According to press sources, Hadh√°zy negotiated with numerous individual candidates to step back for the benefit of the most prominent opposition candidate, without authorization of the party leadership. As a result, the LMP's ethics committee initiated proceedings against him, but all of these were covered to the public until the election. Despite Tam√°s Harangoz√≥ (MSZP) withdrew his candidacy in favour of Hadh√°zy, he again lost to Fidesz MP Istv√°n Horv√°th in Szeksz√°rd constituency. Hadh√°zy became MP via his party's national list. As the governing Fidesz‚ÄìKDNP won a two-thirds majority in a row for the third time, Hadh√°zy resigned as co-leader of the LMP at the night of the election day. He was interviewed by 24.hu on the next day, where he claimed former party leader Andr√°s Schiffer and board secretary R√≥bert Benedek Sallai threatened party candidates with litigation of million HUF to not to withdraw their candidacy. Both politicians refused the charges. On 14 April, Sallai physically assaulted Hadh√°zy during an ethics committee meeting. Hadh√°zy filed charges against his party colleague due to the attack. Hadh√°zy refused to attend the opening session of the new parliamentary term on 8 May 2018, claiming the newly formed national assembly as \\"illegitimate\\" due to the result of the controversial national election. He took his parliamentary oath a month later, on 4 June. Meanwhile Hadh√°zy was marginalized within LMP. On 24 May, the party's disciplinary banned Hadh√°zy from bearing any party positions for the upcoming two years because of his role in the campaign period of the national election, when he negotiated with the representatives of other parties without authorization. Hadh√°zy left the party on 20 June 2018, but he stated he wish to retain his parliamentary mandate.

Hathaway Company, noted American shirt maker. Hathaway was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to Joshua and Rebecca (Foster) Hathaway. At age 11, he left school to work at Russell's Nail Factory. At age 15, he learned the printer's trade with E. Merriam and Company of West Brookfield, Massachusetts, and later working for G. and C. Merriam of Springfield. On February 18, 1840, at age 23, he mentioned in a letter to his fianc√©e Temperance Blackwell some details of his work in a \\"neck stock\\" shirt factory that had been started in Plymouth by his uncle Benjamin. The two were married in May, 1840, in her hometown of Waterville, Maine, and he apparently returned to work in the Plymouth shirt factory until he sold his share in 1843. Around 1844 they moved to Waterville, where for three years Hathaway worked for various printers. Then in 1847, for $571.47 he bought good-will, press, type, and stock of a local printing business, and in April of that year published the first issue of the Waterville Union, a weekly paper of four pages filled with sermons, religious homilies, and moral stories. It lasted only a few weeks, and on July 19, 1847, he sold out to Ephraim Maxham for $475. In 1848, or perhaps 1850, Hathaway and Josiah Tillson built the Hathaway and Tillson shirt factory at Watertown, Massachusetts. His journal entry for March 31, 1853, notes: \\"Sold all my property in the firm of Hathaway and Tillson in Watertown to Josiah Tillson for $900.\\" The next day's diary entry reads: \\"Agreed to go into company in Waterville with [his brother] G.A.H. in July. The firm will be called C. F. Hathaway and Co. I shall put in $4000, he $2000 and have one third of the profits.\\" Hathaway moved back to Waterville in April 1853, and the C.F. Hathaway Company shirt factory was in operation by October of that year. It was successful as a shirt maker for well over one hundred years, continuing in operation until 2002, although by the time Hathaway died in 1893, others were in control of the factory and he had no management role.

History  A decision to rebuild Castle Hill was taken after the defensive stronghold constructed on it was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. There are only a few historical sources that inform us about development of the grounds around the castle and allocating them for green areas. A development plan from 1836 indicates that at the upper castle there was a garden of irregular shape with a small square in the centre and four paths going outwards. Between the former upper and lower castle, there was a second garden shaped as an irregular polygon. In 1837 Carl Habsburg ordered the blowing up of the remains of the upper castle and the building of a castle in the Classicist style on the ruins of the lower castle. The new building was a summer residence of the Habsburg called the Hunting Palace of the Habsburg. The park at Castle Hill was designed by Joseph Kornh√§usel, the court architect of the Viennese court. In 1914 in the north-west part of the hill artificial ruins were erected to emphasize the romantic nature of the park. Among the trees which grow on in the park on Castle Hill, eight are monuments of nature.  List of trees and monuments of nature  The following trees growing in the part are worth mentioning: * Pedunculate elms (263 cm/22 m and 223 cm/19 m), the first growing right at the entrance to the park on the left side of the aisle and the other slightly higher behind the wall from the side of Olza river * Chestnuts (397 cm/23 m and 380 cm/23 m) grow next to each other in the lower part of the park on the right side of the path - monuments of nature * European ash trees (407 cm/25 m and 440 cm/ 23 m), one is growing in the vicinity of the administration building of Cieszyn Castle - Zamkowa 3B Street, the second, double-trunked, dominates the panoramic terrace.

Career Known for his fairness and common sense, Nick Borkovich was a Superior court justice in Ontario, who served on the bench for 28 years, starting in 1982. Along with three other judges, he jokingly became part of the \\"Slavic bench\\". Walter Stayshyn, Eugene Fedak and William Festeryga were of Ukrainian descent, whereas Borkovich was of Serbian heritage. Borkovich attended McMaster University and Osgoode Hall Law School with his good friend Walter Stayshyn. Called to the Ontario bar in 1962, Borkovich articled with John Munroe and Jack Pelech. In 1963, Borkovich and Stayshyn opened a law practice in Hamilton. According to Jaime Stephenson, president of the Hamilton Criminal Lawyers' Association, Borkovich truly believed in the jury system, \\"He was firm, but also kind and never devalued any participant in the judicial system, ...\\" However, he also knew when to come down hard, giving a violent child molester one of the harshest sentences ever assigned in Canada. Background Born in Oakville, Ontario to Serbian immigrant parents, Borkovich moved to east Hamilton when he was a child. He graduated from Delta Secondary School where he played baseball and basketball.

She opened her own workshop in 1928, pioneering printed textile designs in Denmark. She initially produced classical patterns but later adopted a more abstract approach in her creations for L.F. Foght. For over 50 years, she collaborated with Haandarbejdets Fremme. Early life and education Born on 13 January 1895 in the village of Torslunde, Ish√∏j Municipality, Gudrun Stig Aagaard was the daughter of the factory manager Einar Nielsen (1855‚Äì1908) and Elisabeth Margrethe Thomsen (1857‚Äì1960). She was educated as a weaver in the early 1920s at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Arts and Crafts School for Women) in Copenhagen and at the Acad√©mie des Beaux Arts des Tissus in Lyon, France. Career Aagaard first worked in Anton Rosen's textile workshop. After using the batik technique for a number of years, she sought a simpler approach to printing fabrics. She made a number of study trips to England, France and Germany, where she was introduced to textile printing and dye production at IG Farben in Frankfurt. In 1928, she opened her own workshop, producing printed, woven and embroidered goods. She became particularly interested in the traditional Danish calico print technique known as kattuntryk. Inspired by the old presses she had found in museums, she developed patterns on linoleum blocks. Unlike her contemporaries who used time-consuming screen printing techniques, in the later 1940s she continued developing calico prints in her workshop, providing the means for her to develop her own expressive patterns. As a result of growing demand in the 1950s, some of her patterns were adapted for screen printing. Aagaard also created patterns for commercial production by the L.F. Foght textile firm. Her most popular patterns based on floral or abstract contoured designs included Levende Sten (1950), Lianer (1951) and Mohamed (1953). Her patterns were carefully produced, combining flowers, leaves, triangles and zigzagging lines. They exhibit discrete, harmonious shades, frequently inspired by plants. Aagaard's work was exhibited at home and abroad. Items were included in \\"The Arts of Denmark\\" exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1960‚Äì61) and at the many shows arranged by Haandarbejdets Fremme where she was employed for over 50 years. Gudrun Stig Aagaard died on 19 April 1986 in Copenhagen.

It is a section of contemporary Przykopa Street (formerly Nad M≈Çyn√≥wkƒÖ) which comprises buildings from the 18th-19th century, many of them with bridges over the course of M≈Çyn√≥wka (an artificial canal). In the past the buildings over M≈Çyn√≥wka belonged to craftsmen: tanners, weavers, clothiers, leather-dressers and smiths, who needed constant access to water for their craft. It is the area between the intersection of Przykopa Street and Jan ≈Åyska Avenue and the corner of Przykopa and Schodowa streets.  The origin of the name  It is unknown when exactly the name Venice of Cieszyn entered everyday language. The term is based on a comparison of the street in Cieszyn located near an artificial watercourse with its several bridges over the canal to numerous canals of Italian Venice. There is no official document which would refer to the matter but it is assumed that this term emerged in the second half of the 20th century. The term Przykopa or M≈Çyn√≥wka refers to the artificial watercourse at the foot of the scarp on which Cieszyn was founded. Afterwards the names referred to the suburbs of Cieszyn and then to a quarter of the city. The quarter of Przykopa was composed of the present streets: Przykopa, 3 Maja, Zamkowa and the Olza River.  Historic monuments register  Przykopa Street, house no. 25 Some of the buildings of Venice of Cieszyn are registered in the Register of Historic Monuments of Silesian Voivodeship: * Przykopa street, with retaining walls, 18th/19th century (registration number: A-442/86 dated 11.07.1986) * House, Przykopa street 14, 19th century (registration number: 911/68 dated 29.07.1968 and A-218/77 dated 1.12.1977) * House, Przykopa street 15, 19th century (registration number: 912/68 dated 29.07.1968 and A-219/77 dated 1.12.1977) * House, Przykopa street 17, 1790 (registration number: 913/68 dated 29.07.1968 and A-220/77) * House, Przykopa street 25, 18th, 19th and 20th century (registration number: 914/68 dated 29.11.1968 and A-221/77 dated 1.12.1977) The oldest buildings come from the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. The oldest object in this part of the city is a portal at a descent to the basement of building No. 26 dated back to the 16th-17th century.  History and development  M≈Çyn√≥wka canal in 1993 From the 16th century there was a farm located in the area of Przedmie≈õcie (the Suburbs). Its parcelling in the second half of the 17th century contributed to the economic development of this part of Cieszyn. At the end of the 17th century Przedmie≈õcie Przykopa was listed in ‚Äúurbarze‚Äù - economic books of the Chamber of Cieszyn kept for the Habsburgs. In the said book from 1692 Przedmie≈õcie is described as: Bey der Wasser thor und an den M√ºhlgraben, which meant literally: By the Water Gate and at M≈Çyn√≥wka. 35 surnames of property owners are registered there. In the census from 1830 in 42 homes there were 65 households and 290 inhabitants. On 20 March 1849 Przykopa was incorporated by municipal law into the administrative borders of Cieszyn and became a quarter of the city. In the second half of the 19th century in four consecutive population censuses for 1880-1910 there were 50 to 54 properties and the number of inhabitants increased from 561 to 669. From the 16th century craftsmen settled at M≈Çyn√≥wka: potters, clothiers, dyers, weavers and blacksmiths. Most of the buildings served them as their houses, although some of them were merely workshops (e.g. the tannery of Steffan family in the 18th century). In the Middle Ages near the so-called Water Gate and a bridge located near the castle there were baths, which operated here from the end of the 14th century to the 1670s. Later they were relocated to Srebrna street. The next building was a slaughterhouse, built for the Chamber of Habsburg family in Cieszyn in the second half of the 18th century, which after having bankrupted (due to strong competition) was purchased in 1889 by the Committee for construction of a bath in Cieszyn. At the site a new building was erected: The Imperial Baths in Cieszyn (the name changed later to; City Baths), was designed by a local architect Alojzy Jedek. The utility ensured access to public baths for inhabitants of Cieszyn. This was the most popular way of securing hygiene. The baths were liquidated in 1976 after new ones were constructed at Liburnia street. The most important economic object of Przedmie≈õcie Przykopa was the so-called Great Mill, mentioned in 1461 in a document of the Duke of Cieszyn Przemys≈Çaw II. In the vicinity of the mill were the prince's barns, which served as warehouses for grain and flour. The water mill used the stream of M≈Çyn√≥wka to move a water wheel which milled grains of groats and cereals from the prince's farms. The flour produced was sold or used in the castle kitchen. After several fires in the second half of the 17th century, the mill was destroyed and later reconstructed in the 18th century. From that time it fulfilled its purpose to the 1930s. In 1932-1939 the mill was owned by a Jewish married couple Leon and Maria Hochsteinn who opened a water power station there. After World War II the facility was taken over by Knitting Industry Plant Juwenia, and the power station was liquidated in 1965. The end of the 19th century is associated with a change in the characteristics of Przykopa from a craftsmen area to an industrial quarter. The first big investment goes back to 1895 - it was the Tannery of Soft and Hard Leather of Zygmunt Kohn. The next were the Iron Furniture and Metal Plates Factory of Jan Juraszek and the Furniture Factory of Jan Tomica. After 1945 there was one more change in the character of the quarter - three industrial plants were built there: Electrical Machinery Factory Celma (near the Freedom Bridge), specialising in the production of motors, a Paints and Varnishes Factory (the middle part of Przykopa quarter) and the Juwenia facility (located next to the Friendship Bridge), based on the company of the Kohn family.  Art at the Venice of Cieszyn  On 4 June 2009 at the Venice of Cieszyn a theatre performance entitled The Carnival of Venice took place. The performance was put on by actors of Teatr Gry and Ludzie from Katowice as a part of the ‚ÄúAlternative off-stage‚Äù that operated simultaneously with the 20th edition of the International Theatre Festival ‚ÄúWithout Borders‚Äù. On 26 April 2012 on the Venice of Cieszyn a biennale took place organized by the Foundation of Social and Cultural Animation operating at the University of Silesia in Cieszyn.  Legends and tales  Folk tales have it that M≈Çyn√≥wka and the nearby Olza River were inhabited by utopce (drowners), which are perceived either as ghosts in charge of rivers, ponds and streams or drowned men. One of the tales entitled O utopcu (About a drowner) takes place on Przedmie≈õcie Przykopa.  Trivia  There is a possibility of a virtual sightseeing of the Venice of Cieszyn.

Research and career Yasseri's research investigates complex systems, computational social science, network science, social data science and human dynamics. =wikipedia= Yasseri has studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\"undo\\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\"reverting/reverted pairs\\" or \\"mutually reverting edit pairs\\". Such a \\"mutually reverting edit pair\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\"mutually reverting edit pairs\\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of wikipedia. The English wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism and Muhammad. By comparison, for the German wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology and 9/11 conspiracy theories. In a study published by PLoS ONE in 2012 he estimated the share of contributions to different editions of wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015. =Machine sociology and bots conflict= In a 2017 article titled \\"Even Good Bots Fight\\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171774, Yasseri and his colleagues studied interactions between wikipedia bots. Their work illustrating the unpredictable and somewhat surprising social interactions between bots, ignited a discussion on the topic of machine sociology and the human-like behaviour of systems of semi-autonomous agents such as wikipedia bots.https://www.wired.com/2017/03/internet-bots-fight- theyre-human/ Drawing on complex systems theory, Yasseri argues that even simple and predictable bots with a common goal and design might show unpredictable emergent behaviour when deployed at mass scalehttps://theconversation.com/never-mind-killer-robots-even-the-good-ones- are-scarily-unpredictable-82963. =Social media and politics= Yasseri has studied the role of social media in politics.

Biography Born in Ashtarak, Armenia, Muradian was drafted into the Soviet Army during World War II and saw action against the forces of Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front. Following the Soviet collapse against the invading German army he became a refugee from both Nazis and the Soviets and performed with the Stanislav Symphony Orchestra, the Lvov Opera, and on the vaudeville stage in Warsaw. His travels during this period also brought him to Berlin and Vienna and finally to Venice, where he settled in to study. In Venice he enrolled at the Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello di Venezia and while there studied composition with Gabriele Bianchi, violin with Luigi Ferro, and Viola d‚Äôamore with Renzo Sabatini. 1948 saw Muradian graduate from the conservatory with a degree as a Professor of music and still in Venice he took a position teaching at the Moorat Raphael College. In 1950 he left Italy and transplanted himself to the United States where he resided until his death in 2018 and where he wrote all of his major musical compositions. Henceforth he played violin in several musical ensembles including the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra. He then removed himself as an orchestra member to focus solely upon composition. His works have been performed by the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra, the Chicago Chamber Orchestra, the Little Orchestra Society of New York, the New Jersey Association of Verrisimo opera, and the Viola d‚Äôamore Society of America, among others.

Background During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities,Benjamin Franklin also engaged France in the war, which meant that many of the privateers were also from France. such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal.

Lizette Woodworth Reese, founding member of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore. American Women: Fifteen Hundred Biographies Vol II (1897), ed. Frances E. Willard. The Woman‚Äôs Literary Club of Baltimore (1890-1941) grew out of the tradition of women‚Äôs clubs that flourished in late nineteenth-century America. A number of literary societies founded throughout the country during this time provided women a chance to read and discuss literature in a supportive setting. These clubs originated to fill a void left by the limited educational opportunities for girls. The Women's Literary Club of Baltimore differed from the majority of women's clubs, however, in focusing on getting their work published. The group provided mutual support for one another, not just in their study of literature but to support each other‚Äôs efforts in pursuing literary careers. Over the course of its existence, hundreds of works by Club members were published in magazines, newspapers, and by major book publishers. The Woman‚Äôs Literary Club of Baltimore was founded in March 1890, and was the idea of two young writers, Louisa C.Osburne Haughton and Hester Crawford Dorsey, who issued an invitation to discuss founding a club ‚Äúto further greater intellectual development of the women of Baltimore and to promote social relations among those of similar tastes.‚Äù Nearly 40 women responded. One of the first orders of business at the initial meeting was the selection of a name. The inclusion of Woman in the club‚Äôs title was significant. Not only did it identify the membership; it also announced the belief that women writers were different from their male counterparts. Club members took as their motto ‚ÄúParole Femine‚Äù (womanly words), a phrase from the Maryland state motto. They believed that women writers brought a different sensibility to their work and could raise the standards of literature. The Club founders were serious in purpose and set out a formal structure through which to achieve their goals. Their Constitution enumerated the duties and responsibilities of officers and members. The Club was run by elected officers, who formed the Club‚Äôs Board of Managers. Membership in the Club was limited at first to women ‚Äúwho had a sufficient interest in literature to have devoted some time and thought to original work for either newspapers or magazines or of a more lasting nature‚Äù; all eleven of the Club‚Äôs founding members were published authors. The requirement that members be published authors eventually eased, and women interested in literary pursuits were offered membership. At its 30th anniversary, it was noted that the Club had been eager to recognize and foster young talent. Publication, however, remained an important goal for the Club, and the president‚Äôs remarks often praised the publication successes of its members.Emily Lantz, ‚ÄúWoman‚Äôs Literary Club Thirty Years Old This Week,‚Äù Baltimore Sun April 4, 1920. Some of the best-known writers affiliated with the Club included Lizette Woodworth Reese, Margaret Sutton Briscoe, Louise MalloyLouise Malloy papers, at the University of Maryland libraries, and Harriet Lummis Smith. The Club met weekly, on Tuesday afternoons, between October and the first week in June, leaving the summer months free for members to escape the city heat in travel or stays at summer homes. The Club never owned a clubhouse, as was common for clubs at this time. They remained a fairly small group, capping their membership at 100, and while this allowed them funds for their activities, it would not support the purchase and maintenance of a building. Instead, the group affiliated with the Maryland Academy of Sciences in 1891 as associate members, and were allowed to establish their meeting room in the Academy‚Äôs building. The Academy moved several times in the Club‚Äôs early years, but when they finally moved to 105 West Franklin Street, the former mansion of Maryland governor Thomas Swann, the Club was provided with a comfortable meeting space until 1921, when they began meeting in a room at the Arundell Club at 1000 N. Charles Street. The heart of the Woman‚Äôs Literary Club of Baltimore was its committees, where the members tested their literary works to be presented at the weekly meetings. Each member was required to belong to at least one committee, but it was recommended they not belong to more than two so as to have time to give adequate attention to the committee work. The committee chair selected the topics and organized the discussions, debates and critical analysis of members‚Äô work. The committee setting was where the members presented their work and received, as one member put it, ‚Äúa baptism of friendly criticism.‚ÄùEmily Lantz, ‚ÄúTwenty-Five Years Old Today.‚Äù Baltimore Sun March 23, 1915. In committee sessions some members shared poems, short stories, book chapters, translations, or an act from a play. Others wrote papers on artistic movements, music and musicians, or historical events. After thorough vetting by the committee, papers deemed ready for wider hearing were selected by the committee chair and presented at a weekly meeting of the Club. The committees, and their plans of work, varied from year to year depending on the chair. The committees that presented programs to the Club most often were those dealing with literature: Fiction, Modern Poetry, Drama, Essays, Current Criticism and Translation. Three long-standing committees were Art, Music, and Education. American history was of great interest to the members, supporting committees in Colonial and Revolutionary History, Letters and Autographs, and ‚ÄúUnfamiliar Records.‚Äù Archaeology, the specialty of longtime Club president Letitia Yonge Wrenshall, was a long-standing committee. In addition to weekly meetings, the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore held salons, which were social events with a musical program and refreshments. Members were permitted to invite guests, male or female, to attend. The Home Committee was in charge of decorating the rooms and providing the refreshments. To provide inspiration for members, the Club maintained a library of books written by themselves as well as their fellow Maryland authors. Each January beginning in 1902, the Club held an annual Twelfth Night Celebration, an elaborate dinner with a musical program and a Christmas cake baked with souvenirs that was paraded through the gathering. On All Souls‚Äô Day, November 2, the Club members decorated the graves of authors and artists buried in Maryland. Among those honored were Edgar Allan Poe, Junius Brutus Booth, John Pendleton Kennedy, Sidney Lanier, Col. Richard Malcolm Johnston, William H. Rinehart, and former Club member Mary Spear Tiernan. In 1907, members of the WLCB organized the Edgar Allan Poe Memorial Association in advance of the centennial of his birth in 1909. The Club did not admit black members, though at least one Jewish woman belonged (Henrietta Szold, who later founded the Zionist women's organization Hadassah); and while some of its members strongly supported suffrage, no mention of the Club's participation in suffrage activities is recorded. The Woman‚Äôs Literary Club of Baltimore completed its final season in May 1941. Louisa C. Osburne Haughton, one of the originators of the Club, served as president for its final 23 years. Notices of meetings and events published in the Baltimore Sun indicate that the Club stayed true to its mission of supporting women writers and their literary pursuits.

Mohammed Yaqub, Yaqub's father, paid for additional private autopsy and ballistics tests and insisted that his son was doing \\"nothing wrong\\" at the time of the shooting. During the 2018 trial at Leeds Crown Court the driver of the car, Mohsin Amin, was found guilty of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The two other males, David Butlin and Rexhino Arapaj were cleared of firearms charges but Butlin was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon - a push dagger. Yaqub was in one of two cars travelling in a convoy when four unmarked police vehicles stopped them at junction 24 of the motorway in Huddersfield. While Amin obeyed police instructions, Yaqub had crouched down and as he brought his hands back up the officer was \\"under no doubt he was holding a handgun\\", The Judge told Amin at sentencing: \\"You knew that Yassar Yakub had a gun, which you both intended should be used in a way that endangered life in a preconceived and imminent way.\\" The Crown Prosecution Service said there was evidence of \\"an ongoing drug feud\\".

It is situated in the quarter of Castelletto, near Galeazzo Alessi's Villa delle Peschiere. It was constructed from 1599 to 1603 as a suburban villa for the Genoese noblemen Stefano Balbi, ambassador to Milan, and Giovanni Battista Balbi. The name Zerbino is derived from the Ligurian word zerbo, meaning \\"uncultivated\\"‚Äî at the time when the villa was built, the surrounding area was still outside of the city walls and uncultivated. In the 18th century it passed to Marcello III Durazzo, then to the Gropallo family. It is now owned by the Castelbarco Albani family and used as a venue for events and exhibitions.  History  The villa was built from 1599 to 1603 as summer house for the Genoese noblemen Stefano Balbi, ambassador to Milan, e Giovanni Battista Balbi. In In the 18th century it passed to Marcello III Durazzo and. at the beginning of the 19th century, the Durazzo family commissioned to the architect Emanuele Andrea Tagliafichi the enlargement and landscaping of the garden. In the second half of the 19th century, the villa remained untouched by the urban expansion of the city, which surrounded it without compromising the unity of the monumental site. At the end of the century the villa passed to the Gropallo until the last descendant of the family, the marquess Laura Gropallo della Sforzesca left it in 1995 to her two sons Cesare e Marcello Castelbarco Albani. The villa is now used as a venue for meetings, events and exhibitions..  Description  = Architecture = The architecture of the villa follows the traditional tri-partition of the fa√ßade, common in Genoa at the time under the influence of Galeazzo Alessi. Also the internal distribution is a typical one, centered around the main rooms. = Decoration = The internal decoration, still well preserved, includes the 17th century frescoes at the piano nobile by Domenico Piola and Gregorio De Ferrari, the latter credited with the most notable fresco in the central room, featuring Time and the Seasons.

He began his college basketball career with the Illinois State Redbirds. After playing sparingly for three seasons, he transferred to join the Hofstra Pride, where he led the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) in scoring and was named second-team all-conference. Upshaw played professionally in Slovenia and Luxembourg before returning to the United States and joining the Grand Rapids Drive of the NBA Development League (now known as the G League). In the Drive's regular season finale in 2017‚Äì18, he collapsed on the court in the game's final minute and died two days later. High school career Upshaw was born in Chicago. As a child, he gravitated toward basketballs at Toys \\"R\\" Us over all the other toys in the store. He began playing organized basketball when he was six. Upshaw attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools where he averaged 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists as a junior in 2008, when he was named the most valuable player (MVP) of the Independent School League. College career After redshirting his first year at Illinois State University (ISU), Upshaw played three years for the Redbirds, albeit with minimal playing time. He averaged 1.6 points per game, while never averaging more than 7.4 minutes played per game. He graduated from Illinois State with a degree in apparel, merchandising and design in 2013, but transferred to Hofstra for his final season of NCAA eligibility. Upshaw exercised the graduate transfer exception, which enables players who have already received their degree but have eligibility remaining to be able to play immediately at another school while studying for a post-graduate degree in a discipline that was not available in their previous school. He was seeking a school where he could be an \\"impact player and have an opportunity to [play professionally] overseas or somewhere.\\" After receiving his release from ISU, Upshaw was originally recruited by Niagara coach Joe Mihalich. However, the coach left soon for Hofstra, where he told Upshaw the opportunity to play was even higher because four players had been kicked off the team after a burglary incident. On January 15, 2014, Upshaw scored 27 points and tied a Pride record with seven three-pointers in a 69‚Äì64 win over UNC-Wilmington. He led the CAA in scoring at 19.8 points per game, and earned second-team All-CAA honors. His 17.3 points per game increase over his 2.5 average from 2012‚Äì13 was the largest increase in Division I basketball. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, he passed on the option to enter the NBA Development League Draft. Instead, he signed with Helios Suns of the Premier A Slovenian Basketball League in September 2014. In 30 games for Helios in 2014‚Äì15, he averaged 9.8 points and 3.2 rebounds per game. In August 2015, Upshaw signed with Basket Esch of Luxembourg's Total League for the 2015‚Äì16 season. In 27 games, he averaged 20.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. After deciding to enter the 2016 NBA Development League Draft, Upshaw was selected in the fourth round by the Grand Rapids Drive. In 34 games for the Drive in 2016‚Äì17, he averaged 6.5 points and 3.0 rebounds per game. Death On March 24, 2018, Upshaw scored 11 points in the regular-season finale to earn a playoff spot for Grand Rapids in a 101‚Äì99 home win over the Long Island Nets. In the game's final minute, however, he collapsed and was taken off the court at DeltaPlex Arena on a stretcher. Paramedics started cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance, seven minutes after his collapse, and his heart did not start again until 40 minutes later in the hospital. Two days later on March 26, Upshaw died in Spectrum Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at the age of 26. The Kent County medical examiner's preliminary determination after conducting an autopsy was that Upshaw had a sudden cardiac death. It was later expanded to state Upshaw had \\"cardiac abnormalities\\" that his family had no prior knowledge of.https://www.ridiculousupside.com/2018/6/11/17438040/zeke-upshaw-nba- wrongful-death-lawsuit-pistons-drive-g-league Out of respect for Upshaw, the NBA G League delayed the first round of the 2018 playoffs, while the Detroit Pistons gave him an honorary call-up to the team on March 29 for their game against the Washington Wizards. On May 30, 2018, Upshaw's parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the NBA, the Detroit Pistons, the SSJ Group, who owns the Grand Rapids Drive, and the DeltaPlex Arena. Afterwards, the Detroit Free Press reported that a year earlier, he had fainted and been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the chief cause of heart- related deaths of young athletes in the U.S. and which, combined with over- exertion, is believed to have killed him. In July 2019, the NBA and the Detroit Pistons settled a lawsuit with Upshaw's family.

The Osk√©lan√©o River runs successively in the cantons of Faucher and Achintre. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. The route 404, connecting the village of Clova, Quebec to the South Bay of Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir) serves the lower part of the Osk√©lan√©o River; this road connects to the south-east the route 400 which goes to Gouin Dam. Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities. The surface of the Osk√©lan√©o River is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March.  History  Thanks to the arrival of the Transcontinental Railway around 1910, Oskelaneo River Station contributed to the development of the village of Osk√©lan√©o. The main economic activity was forestry. Nevertheless, recreational tourism activities developed rapidly, notably with the first raising of the Gouin Reservoir level in 1918, then the second raising in 1948. Given the current level of water in the lake, the village of Osk√©lan√©o offers access to boating a direct access road to Gouin Reservoir down the Osk√©lan√©o River. In the past, prior to the development of motorized forest roads, travelers were getting off the train at the Oskelaneo River station and using the services of outfitters for hunting and fishing trips.  Geography   Toponymy  Until 1918, when the erection of the La Loutre Central, which will create the first level designated then Gouin Reservoir, the Osk√©lan√©o River was considered to be one of the tributaries of the Saint- Maurice River), feeding the Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir). This hydronym appears in cartographic documents at least since the first half of the 19th century, i.e. on the map of Charles Magnus (1857), in the form of Oskelanaio, then that of Eug√®ne Tach√© in 1870. In 1914, this river was designated Escalana by Eug√®ne Rouillard and on maps in particular in 1935. The designation \\"Escalona\\" is also indicated on maps of 1924 and 1926. Escalana (or Escalona) derives from osk√©lan√©o which is an Algonquin word meaning \\"bones\\". Nevertheless, some sources consider that osk√©lan√©o results from the deformation and fusion of the words tchiask, meaning \\"gull\\", and sakegane, meaning \\"lake\\"; consequently, this hydronym would be translated as \\"gull lake\\" or \\"gull flight\\". In Atikamekw, the Osk√©lan√©o River becomes \\"Kiackoranan Sipi\\", meaning \\"river of the gull caught in the net\\". One [Canadian National] railway station has been designated \\"Oskelaneo River\\". The term \\"Oskelaneo\\", alone, was the name of a post office (1921-1973) serving what is now a hamlet.Source: Names and places of Quebec, a work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by Micro-Intel in 1997, based on this dictionary.

Life and family  Born in Edinburgh, the daughter of James Lawson, she received some instruction in drawing and painting from William Simpson RSA. In 1849 she moved to Ireland having married Dublin barrister John Rutherford D‚ÄôOlier (1816-1899). They had two children Helen Lawson D'Olier (d. 1948) and Isaac Matthew D'Olier (1850-1913). D'Olier died on 29 June 1887.  Artistic work  Edward Sullivan (1914), The Book of Kells Plate XI by H. D'Olier While she did produce some traditional landscape paintings it is for her skill in reproducing illuminations from medieval manuscripts, and particularly from the Book of Kells, for which this artist is best remembered. Her copies, on vellum, of the illustrations in the 9th-century Book of Kells, are noted for their exactness and fidelity. D'Olier spent many years copying these illustrations, at a time when copyists were permitted to work directly from the manuscript itself. It can be seen, from her surviving drawings, that D'Olier had been permitted to trace the designs directly from the pages of the manuscript. Apart from her meticulous reproductions D'Olier researched the history of the manuscripts, particularly the origins of the pigments used to decorate them. In 1884 she lectured on the subject in Alexandra College, showing magic-lantern slides of her work. Some of her illustrations were included in a lecture on the Book of Kells given by Professor J.D Westwood, in Oxford which was published in 1887. Her work was also included in a paper read to the Dublin Society in 1887 by Professor W.J.Hartley She is known to have worked on the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Bodleian's Liber Sacramentorum. Her work was exhibited in the Dublin Exhibition of 1861 and 1872. In 1914 Sir Edward Sullivan (1852-1928) produced a very popular book on the Book of Kells with 24 full-colour plates. At the time it was technically easier to reproduce drawings than photographs in illustrated books, and so the images used in Sullivan's book were made by Helen D'Olier. James Joyce is known to have owned a copy of this book which he took with him wherever he went. He told Arthur Powers (1891-1984) that the Book of Kells was ‚Äòthe most purely Irish thing we have‚Äô and that he 'pored over' Sullivan's book 'for hours'. When Joyce was exclaiming in Finnegans Wake over the 'Tunc page', as he calls Matthew 27:38, he was in fact basing his observations on images made by D'Olier.

Location  Ludwigsthal lies on the B 11 federal highway between Zwiesel and Bayerisch Eisenstein. It also has a halt on the Bavarian Forest Railway.  History  In 1826 master glassworker, Georg Christoph Abele from Neuhurkenthal, founded a glassworks in the Bohemian Forest and named it one year later after King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In 1830, Abele had a mansion built by the royal architect and building foreman, Lexa, to plans drawn up by Prague master builder, von Zobel. From 1828 to 1848, white, then green, mirror glass was produced at the factory. In March 1860, all the property was auctioned off due to insolvency. It was sold for 44,000 guilders to butcher, Josef Pauli, and brewer, Josef Kammermeier, both from Zwiesel. At the end of the 19th century, the company switched to bottle glass manufacture. The glassworks, which still employed about 200 people after the Second World War, was closed in 1981. At the beginning of 2006, the empty building collapsed under masses of snow. The mansion of the glassworks owners, which was leased by the association Pro National Park in January 2008, and the glassmakers' houses are still standing. The firm of Krystallglasmanufaktur Ludwigsthal has continued the tradition of glass art in Ludwigsthal since 2001 with demonstration glassworks. On 1 June 1876, Prince Otto arrived at the mansion house to spend several weeks in Ludwigsthal. On the advice of his doctors, he often walked in the forest, and his favorite path along the Regen to Regenh√ºtte still bears the name Prinzensteig or \\"Prince's Trail\\". The chapelry of Ludwigsthal was established in 1894; this was followed in 1912 by its elevation to a parish. Near Ludwigsthal there is the information centre, \\"Haus zur Wildnis\\", of the Bavarian Forest National Park and an animal enclosure covering 65 hectares. In 1950, the Ludwigsthal Dog Sports Association was founded, in 1977, Ludwigsthal Tennis Club and, in 1981, the Ludwigsthal Fishing Club. In 1989 the parish of Ludwigsthal counted 947 Catholics. The old railway station building at Ludwigsthal station, 1.5 kilometres from the village, is now privately owned and not open to the public. One kilometre closer to the village - directly next to the National Park Visitor Centre - a new Ludwigsthal halt was established in 2003.  Sights  The Neo-Romanesque parish church of the Sacred Heart built in 1893/94 to plans by Johann Baptist Schott. It has a unique Neo-Romanesque d√©cor by Munich artist, Franz Xaver Hofst√∂tter (1871‚Äì1913). An unusual feature is the rich painting of the interior rooms. In the vicinity of Ludwigsthal is the information centre of Haus zur Wildnis (\\"House of the Wilderness\\") which belongs to the Bavarian Forest National Park and was built in 2006. There is also a 65-hectare animal enclosure in which a covered wooden observation tower stands.Haus zur Wildnis Ludwigsthal on the website of the Tourismusmarketing Bayerischer Wald  Clubs  *TSV Ludwigsthal (tennis) *Freiwillige Feuerwehr Ludwigsthal (volunteer fire brigade) *Fischereiverein Ludwigsthal (fishing) *Sch√ºtzenverein Ludwigsthal (shooting) *ESV Zwiesel am Bahnhof Ludwigsthal  References   External links  Category:Villages in Bavaria Category:Regen (district) ","title":"Ludwigsthal (Lindberg)"},{"id":"56940165","text":"Bob Weinhauer (born May 23, 1939) is an American former basketball coach and executive.

They lie west from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and form three ridges that form a line; one of the ridges rises to a depth of and in the past formed an island. The seamounts are composed out of basaltic and other rocks and their ages range from about 2.5 million years ago to latest Pleistocene; an acoustic swarm recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1991-1992 is considered to be the manifestation of a historical eruption of the Hollister Ridge. The origin of the Hollister Ridge is unclear, with various proposed mechanisms involving the neighbouring Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, crustal weaknesses and the Louisville hotspot.  History  The ridge was discovered either by gravimetry from satellites or by the research ship Eltanin in 1965 and first named \\"Hollister Ridge\\" in a 1995 publication. Rock samples were taken at the ridge in 1996.  Geography and geomorphology  The Hollister Ridge is an aseismic ridge in the Pacific Ocean, west of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. It consists of three separate ridges which are lined up in east-southeast to north-northwest direction, starting from the axis of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and ending in the direction of the Louisville seamount chain. The eastern ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level, the central ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level, the western ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level. The central ridge formed an island in the past.  Geology  The ridge rises from a seafloor whose age decreases from 7-8 to 0-1 million years ago southeastward. Three fracture zones, the Heezen, Tharp and Hollister fracture zones, extend northwestward across the seafloor northeast of the Hollister Ridge; at least the first two are considered to be part of the Eltanin fracture zone. A scarp lies south of the Hollister Ridge, and even farther south lies the Udintsev fracture zone. The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge close to the Hollister Ridge is the site of an isolated geoid anomaly which has been interpreted as a product of magmatic upwelling. Rocks sampled from the Hollister Ridge have yielded basalts, alkali basalts, hawaiites, picrites and tholeiites as well as granites, which are most likely dropstones transported to the ridge by icebergs. The basalts range from aphyric to porphyric and contain phenocrysts of olivine and plagioclase. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its origin: * The ridge may be the present-day location of the Louisville hotspot. Petrological differences between the volcanoes formed by this hotspot and the Hollister Ridge make this hypothesis problematic, as are misfits between the reconstructed path of the Louisville hotspot and the position of the Hollister Ridge. Even later plate reconstructions have endorsed this model of origin. * A \\"mini-hotspot\\", which however is not consistent with the geometry of the ridge (which is at an angle to the motion of the Pacific Plate). Such a mini-hotspot may be a branch of the Louisville hotspot. * Asthenosphere may be flowing from the Louisville hotspot to the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. Seamounts and aseismic ridges have been observed in other regions of the world where such flow is expected to occur. * Lineaments in the crust allowed the ascent of magma from the mantle. Such lineaments may be produced by tectonic stresses related to crustal spreading; this theory is supported by the geometry of the Hollister Ridge and the ages of its components. There may be some influence by the Louisville hotspot. Pliocene changes in the plate motion patterns of the region may have generated the lineaments. * One variation of the \\"lineament\\" theory posits that the ridge at first was built by magma ascending through crustal weaknesses; later material from the Louisville hotspot flowed south towards the Hollister Ridge and increasingly interacted with the lineament, thus influencing the composition of the ridge rocks. A change in lithospheric thickness across the Eltanin fracture zone would divert the mantle flow from the Louisville hotspot southward.  Eruptive history  Argon-argon dating has yielded ages ranging from a mean age of 2.531 ¬± 0.036 million years ago for the western ridge over 0.487 ¬± 0.03 million years ago and 0.343 ¬± 0.008 million years ago for the eastern ridge to 91,000 ¬± 12,000 and 0 years ago for the central ridge. This implies that volcanism is still active at the central ridge, which is also the shallowest sector of the Hollister Ridge. There is evidence of historical eruptions at the Hollister Ridge. Between 10 March 1991 and 12 June 1992 a strong acoustic swarm was recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean from several stations in French Polynesia and its source identified with a segment of the Hollister Ridge. Anthropogenic and biological origins were considered unlikely sources for the swarm, and it is thus interpreted to be a volcanic swarm. The acoustic swarm may have resulted from the interaction between seawater and a subaqueous lava lake; the acoustic patterns are not consistent with a simple explosive eruption.

The Union of Cypriots campaigns for a unitary Cypriot state, the restoration of the constitutional order that was destroyed in Cyprus after the crisis of 1963-64 and the ending of the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. History and overview The Union of Cypriots was previously known as the World Union of Turkish-speaking Cypriots, and its origins root back to a youth organisation called LINOBAMBAKI, one of the formations that led the 2011 Turkish Cypriot protests. It is active in Cyprus as well as in the United Kingdom, where, today, Turkish Cypriot population is bigger than in Cyprus. Unlike most of other Turkish Cypriot political movements, it supports a unitary solution instead of a federal one, concerning the reunification of Cyprus. With the idea of Cyprus belonging to all Cypriots, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, the organisation supports turning back to 1960 constitution and reinforcing it more in the line of \\"one nation, one flag, one homeland and one state\\" view. The organization supported Turkish Cypriots who were targeted in the occupied areas of Cyprus, in events such as the prosecution of some community members for hanging the flag of the Republic of Cyprus in 2013, the attacks against the Afrika newspaper by Turkish settlers in 2018, the court cases that were filed against Turkish Cypriot journalists by Turkey in 2019, and the actions against the workers who wanted to cross barricades to enter the free areas in 2020. In 2019, the Union of Cypriots announced to public its interest in participating in the European Parliament elections independently, but later it was represented by its president, Oz Karahan in the list of Jasmine Movement. Today, the organization has a variety of committees for different affairs, as well as an educational initiative called \\"Fazƒ±l √ñnder Academy\\".

Early years Joseph Marie Pi√©tri was born in Sart√®ne, Corsica, on 25 February 1820. His parents were Angelo Francesco Pietri (1784‚Äì1848) and Giulia Pietri (1786‚Äì1853). His family was not wealthy. His brother was Pierre-Marie Pi√©tri(fr), who later became prefect of the police of Paris from January 1852 to January 1858. Pi√©tri studied law in Paris, then practiced as an advocate in Sart√®ne. By ordinance of 31 August 1838 he was appointed justice of the peace in the Corsican canton of Rogliano. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution of 1848. On 9 August 1848 thanks to the support of his brother he was appointed sub-prefect of Argentan. He then became a supporter of Louis- Napoleon Bonaparte. On 29 April 1850 Pi√©tri married Palma de Rocca Serra (1830‚Äì1885) in Sart√®ne. They had several children including Marinette (c. 1843‚Äì1941), Pomponne (1855‚Äì1880) and Louis (born 1872). Pi√©tri was appointed sub-prefect of Brest on 9 May 1852. He became Prefect of Ari√®ge on 3 April 1853. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour on 3 January 1855 for his dedication during an outbreak of cholera. He became Prefect of Cher on 6 November 1855, Prefect of H√©rault on 5 January 1861 and of Prefect of Nord on 12 November 1865. He became known for his administrative qualities and support of the Bonapartist regime. Prefect of Police On 21 February 1866 Pi√©tri was appointed Prefect of Police of Paris in place of Symphorien Boittelle. He was aged 46. By decree of 19 December 1866 he was made a member of the Imperial Commission of the Exposition Universelle of 1867. On 13 August 1867 he was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Pi√©tri was energetic in repressing unrest. On 2 November 1867 he surrounded Montmartre Cemetery in Paris where 1,500 Republicans had gathered at the grave of the deputy Jean- Baptiste Baudin, who had been killed on a barricade on 4 December 1851 after the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851 that brought Napoleon III to power. He also suppressed the demonstration in honour of Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who had defended Ernest Renan in the senate. Pi√©tri did not moderate the violence of his agents, and in December 1867 sent a circular to the police commissioners \\"to guard against any hesitation or failure.\\" At the same time, he declared that \\"individual liberty has never been, under any regime, better guaranteed or better respected.\\" During the general elections of 1869 Pi√©tri took a tough line with men who were hostile to the regime, and in a report to Napoleon on 28 November 1869 attacked powerful men such as Rouher and Persigny. After discovery of the plot that was judged at Blois in 1870 he encouraged the demonstrations on the boulevards of Paris in favour of war with Prussia. A decree of 27 July 1870, which was not published, made him a senator. After the defeat of France at the Battle of Sedan during the Franco- Prussian War he left France hastily on 4 September 1870 and joined Napoleon III in exile. Later career In 1872 Pi√©tri applied to the government of Adolphe Thiers for a retirement pension. Although he did not qualify on age or years of service, a decree in April 1873 fixed his pension arrears at 6,000 francs. L√©on Renault, the prefect of police, reported in January 1875 that Pi√©tri was one of the most active members of the Bonapartist committee. He became a general councilor of Corsica. On 22 June 1879 Pi√©tri was elected Senator of Corsica on an imperialist platform by 256 votes against 227 for his opponent, Tomasi. He sat on the right with the Appel au peuple group. He voted against the application of laws to religious congregations, against changes to the judicial oath, against reform of the magistrature and against restoration of divorce. He left office on 24 January 1885. In the general election of 25 January 1885 he failed to be reelected, winning only 212 out of 744 votes. He was defeated by Paul de Casabianca, who won 477 votes. Pi√©tri retired from politics after this. He died on 4 January 1902 in Sart√®ne at the age of 82.

Personal life and education Susan Kelk graduated high school a year early in Dallas, Texas to attend art school at the age of 16. Since her parents could not help pay her tuition after losing their floral and nursery business Kelk accepted a scholarship from the Dallas Museum of Art and attended the San Francisco School of Fine Arts, now known as the San Francisco Art Institute. Kelk received her B.F.A. in 1965 and M.F.A. in 1968. In her first year of college Kelk met her husband and collaborator Luis Cervantes. They had three sons together. Professional life Susan Cervantes is considered a leader in the Mission District community mural movement and considers herself a community artist responsible for over 400 murals. Cervantes was introduced to murals through Diego Rivera's The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City (1931) at Diego Rivera Gallery and was inspired by and then joined the Mujeres Muralistas in the early 1970s. She was asked to help paint with the Mujeres Muralistas at Paco's Tacos, a restaurant on the corner of 24th and South Van Ness, which marks the moment she lost interest in her studio work on canvas. Though Cervantes was not Chicana her work was strongly influenced by and sensitive to the Chicano art movement. Later, Susan began volunteering as an art teacher at the Precita Valley Community Center where her Thursday night painting workshop quickly became a mural workshop. The class did not have a wall to teach on, so they painted on five plywood panels, totaling 20 feet when assembled. That mural, named Masks of God, Soul of Man was the first and only mural Susan created that didn't have a wall waiting for it, meaning that \\"Walls come to [her]\\" and that her work is all currently by request. It was displayed in the Bernal Heights Library and was debuted as the work of the Precita Eyes Muralists. Susan and Luis founded the Precita Eyes Mural Arts Center in 1977. Precita Eyes has been recognized for creating public art that reflects its community's history and culture. One of only three community mural centers in the United States, Precita Eyes sponsors and implements ongoing mural projects throughout the Bay Area and internationally. Some of her notable work has appeared at the MaestraPeace mural on the Women's Building, Clarion Alley Mural Project, Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, Balmy Alley and on the Northeastern University Latinx Student Cultural Center Precita Eyes has participated in many of the murals that are in San Francisco's historic Mission District neighborhood, known for the murals that cover the walls of many buildings in the neighborhood. They collaborate with schools in the community, as well as other youth programs, to allow youth artists to plan and execute their own mural design at their school or local building. Precita Eyes partners with mural artists to teach technique and creative thinking to the students that they work with, making sure that they have guidance but the freedom to create a mural that is meaningful to them and their community. Also among their slew of programs is a toddler art class, support for young student artists through exhibitions of their work, and providing educational tours of the murals in the neighborhood.

She was built by the London and Glasgow Shipbuilding Company at Clydebank, Scotland in 1909 to operate a passenger service between London and Australia (via the Suez Canal). Tonnage: 12,026 tons. Length: . Breadth: . Maximum speed: . Passengers: 1310 (consisting of 280 first class, 130 second class, 900 third class). Maiden voyage: 1909. Commandeered as a troopship in 1915. Launch Initial attempts to launch the vessel were not auspicious. It was reported that: \\"The Osterley, 12,000 tons, a new steamer built for the Orient Steam Navigation Company, was to have been launched at Govan, Glasgow, yesterday (21 January 1909). The vessel was released on the slip by the Countess of Jersey, but owing to frost affecting the grease the Osterley stopped 40 feet down the ways. Thereupon the vessel was fastened, and the launching was postponed.\\" A second attempt was successful: \\"The steamer Osterley was successfully lowered into the water this morning (26 January 1909). There were six sisterships built for this route: Otway,, Osterley, , Orvieto, and the Orama. Description At the time of launching, and prior to fitout, it was reported: \\"The Osterley, named after the country seat of Lord Jersey, is the third of the five 12,000 ton steamers ordered by the Orient Steam Navigation Company, Limited, to meet the requirements of the mail contract entered into with the Commonwealth Government. The Osterley has been built by the London and Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Company, Limited, and is timed to leave London on her maiden voyage to Sydney on August 6. The length of this great liner is 650ft, and she has a beam of 62ft. Seven decks are to be built ‚Äî boat, promenade, shelter, upper, main lower and orlop ‚Äî and accommodation is to be provided for an exceptionally large number of passengers in three classes. The features of the Osterley will be a divan smoking lounge, or winter garden, for the use of both sexes; a well-equipped library, an electric elevator to run from the main to the promenade decks; wireless telegraphic apparatus, which will be used as soon as land stations have been established on the Australian coast, a nursery for the children, and an up-to-date laundry. The insulated holds will provide for about 2500 tons of perishable produce and the Osterley will develop a speed of 19 knots. The engines will be balanced on a system which will prevent vibration. Mr. Kenneth Anderson, chairman of the Orient S.N. Company, Limited, who arrived at Sydney yesterday from London, states that excellent progress is being made with the construction of the whole of the new steamers.\\" Further details were provided subsequent to the launch: \\"A great improvement has been made in the accommodation for third-class passengers. These will be provided with a spacious dining saloon, music-room, and smoking-room; their sleeping accommodation will be mostly on the upper and main decks, and their promenade deck for exercise and amusement is unusually extensive. The first class saloons, lounges, social halls, and cabins will be palatial, and the second saloon passengers will have accommodation no less roomy and comfortable, even though it is less highly embellished. A feature of the second class is the fact of the accommodation being entirely amidships.\\" Maiden voyage The Osterley's maiden voyage was not everything the owners would have desired. Upon arrival at Fremantle 10 September 1909, a summary report of the voyage to date was provided: \\"Running over 30 hours behind time, the R.M.S. Osterley, the third of the new Orient liners, arrived on her maiden visit to Fremantle yesterday afternoon. The Osterley, which is built on similar lines to the Otway and Orsova, which have already visited Fremantle, is having a somewhat remarkable first voyage. Between London and Plymouth trouble with the cylinders necessitated a longer stay than usual at Plymouth. The time lost at Plymouth was, however, made up before Marseilles was reached, and a good run to Naples landed the Osterley at the Italian port well ahead of the mails. Entering Port Said the bottom of the first intermediate cylinder of the port engine was blown out. Being a quadruple-engined steamer, it was decided at Port Said to cut out and work the Osterley as a triple-expansion-engined vessel. The delay at Port Said was caused by this work. It is just possible that this time might have been made up between Suez and Colombo if no other mishap had occurred, but, leaving Suez on August 21, still working triple- expansion on the port engine, the Osterley had not been long in the Gulf of Suez before the engineers had trouble with an over-heated high-pressure piston rod. It had to be taken out, and the spare rod in the disabled cylinder fitted in its place. This was rather arduous work in the Red Sea, but the two squads of seven engineers, each working shifts of six hours, had the work done in 30 hours. When she left Suez the Osterley was steaming 15 knots, but, during the repairs in the Red Sea her speed was reduced to 10 knots, meaning that in the 30 hours required she lost 150 miles. The Osterley worked with the starboard engines from the time the piston bent, and did 15 knots regularly after the repairs had been effected. The bent piston was landed at Colombo to be straightened. The Osterley, like her sister ships, will be fitted with wireless telegraphy, but the Orient Company are waiting until the land stations have been erected before installing the system on their vessels. She is in charge of Capt. Jenks, late of the R.M.S. Oroya.\\" Fate After its final sailing as a troopship in 1919, the ship returned to the Australia service and was scrapped in Glasgow in 1930.

The museum was founded in 1974 by Georg H√∂ltl with the restoration of the 500-year-old Rothau Mill (Rothaum√ºhle). This building which, following the collapse of its roof timbers in 1972, had been sold by Georg and Centa H√∂ltl, still stands on its original site below the Dreiburgensee. Since then, numerous buildings from across the Bavarian Forest have been transported to the museum. Among the types of building on show are farmhouses, day labourers' houses, chapels, the oldest village school in Germany, workshops and mills. The comprehensive local history collection includes holy articles, farm furniture and household effects, clothing, agricultural tools, jewellery, glass products and carts.

Nagel is notable for being the founding member of the Arabesque girl group in 1977. Life and career Mary Ann Nagel was born as Rita Nagel in 1955. She took on the pseudonym of \\"Mary Ann\\" and began to sing from a very young age. She first released children's songs: So Viele Fragen / La√ü mich nicht so lang allein\\" in 1968 and \\"Pony Girl / Du Ich Lieb' Dich Candy Man\\" in 1972. This was followed by schlager single \\"Schau Mich Nicht So B√∂se An / Ein Tag So Sch√∂n Wie Heut\\" in 1973. The singles did not have much success. Inspired by the recent success of the Silver Convention and other girl groups, Nagel and producers sought to create another girl group. Arabesque was formed in 1977, and \\"Hello Mr. Monkey\\" was released as the first single featuring lead vocals by Nagel. Her participation in the group was short-lived however, she only recorded two songs with the group: disco songs \\"Hello Mr. Monkey / Buggy Boy\\". Nagel's family life became more important than her career as a singer. She was married, had a son, and disliked the long driving from her hometown of Karlsruhe, Germany to Offenbach am Main, where the group was based. Mary Ann was part of Arabesque for a little over a year; she left in September 1978 and was replaced by Heike Rimbeau.

It is an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus algorithm that they consider capable of securing the platform against attacks. It does not use miners to validate transactions, and uses directed acyclic graphs for time-sequencing transactions without bundling them into blocks.  Concept  Several experts describe Hashgraph as a continuation of where the idea of blockchain begins while some consider it as an alternative to it, a technology known as first generation and typified by severe speed, fairness, cost, and security constraints. Some academics maintain it is less technically constrained than blockchains proper. The Hedera white paper co-authored by Baird explained that \\"at the end of each round, each node calculates the shared state after processing all transactions that were received in that round and before,\\" and it \\"digitally signs a hash of that shared state, puts it in a transaction, and gossips it out to the community.\\" Hedera Hashgraph is a public distributed ledger based on the Hashgraph algorithm which in 2018 raised $100 million at a $6 billion market cap. Cornell Professor Emin G√ºn Sirer notes that ‚ÄúThe correctness of the entire Hashgraph protocol seems to hinge on every participant knowing and agreeing upon N, the total number of participants in the system,‚Äù which is \\"a difficult number to determine in an open distributed system.‚Äù Baird responded that ‚ÄúAll of the nodes at a given time know how many nodes there are.‚Äù References Category:Distributed computing Category:Cryptography ","title":"Hashgraph"},{"id":"56941033","text":"The 1993 Mercedes Cup, was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts and held at the Tennis Club Weissenhof in Stuttgart, Germany that was part of the Championship Series of the 1993 ATP Tour.

L. Tilghman, from a 1891 publication. Amelia Louise Tilghman (surname also spelled Tiligman; 6 September 1856 District of Columbia ‚Äì 12 December 1931 District of Columbia) (pronounced \\"TILL man\\") was a pianist, teacher, and activist who, among other things, founded the first African-American journal devoted to music, The Musical Messenger, published from 1886 to 1891.  Biography and work  Amelia Tilghman, the daughter of Margaret Ann Reynolds (maiden; 1819‚Äì1903) and Henry Hyland Tilgman (1811‚Äì1900), grew up in a free black middle-class family in Washington, District of Columbia, Her voice was so remarkable that the bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church apparently once declared, ‚Äúthe child‚Äôs parents had better spend a hundred dollars on her voice not than leave her a fortune when they die.‚Äù Instead, she enrolled in the Normal School of Howard University, graduated in 1870, and accepted a full-time job as a teacher in the black Georgetown public schools in 1870. After fourteen years, she relocated to Boston where studied music pedagogy with Samuel Jamieson (1855‚Äì1930) at the Boston Conservatory of Music, though she never graduated with a degree. In addition to her work as a teacher, Tilghman pursued a career as a pianist. She performed at Steinway Hall in Manhattan, New York, in 1880 and was described by a reviewer as \\"a musical star of the first magnitude.\\" The following year, she was the invited soloist at Saengerfest, a festival at the Grand Opera House in Louisville, Kentucky. There, she heard a choral work of William Batchelder Bradbury, Esther, the Beautiful Queen and was so enamored that she decided to organize, direct, and star in a production of the piece in Washington, D.C. The performance, at Thanksgiving, 1881, was hailed as ‚Äúa grand success,‚Äù for it proved that ‚Äúthere is talent which needs but to be intelligently and thoroughly trained to produce really artistic performances.‚Äù In early 1886, for reasons unknown, Tilghman relocated to Montgomery, Alabama, where she took a job in the public schools. When she arrived, reflected a journalist, looking back from 1893, ‚Äúthere were no colored pianists in Montgomery, and in no house where colored people lived did one hear in passing the artistic rendition of music as is now heard in almost every two or three squares.‚Äù During her first year in town, Amelia organized a recital of her students in a local Congregational Church.  The Musical Messenger  In Montgomery, Tilghman founded the first African-American music journal, a monthly publication called The Musical Messenger. This entr√©e into journalism was not easy for her, as men dominated the field at the time and for years after women reported facing prejudice. The journal‚Äôs tagline was ‚Äúthe highest moral, social and intellectual interest of the people.‚Äù The two surviving issues of the publication‚Äîboth from 1889‚Äîfocus on educating its readers about music history (such as the biography of Hayden), church choir repertoire, and sharing and circulating the names and work of African-American composers. ‚ÄúThat the race stands sadly in need of such a journal should be freely admitted. It is our earnest hope that the educator‚Äôs hands may be strengthened and her soul fortified in this very creditable venture,‚Äù wrote the Philadelphia Tribune. Tilghman returned permanently to Washington, D.C., to assist with the care of her seriously ill mother in 1888. There, she hired the musician and teacher Lucinda B. Bragg Adams (1870-1932) as an associate editor for The Musical Messenger. While roundly celebrated, the publication was not profitable.  Later life  Tilghman discontinued the publication and refocused her energies on teaching after 1891. She died in 1931.
